  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to forecast hourly data, leveraging observed daily seasonality while addressing potential missing values. The approach focuses on averaging each hour across the available 4 days to create a 'typical day' pattern, repeated for the forecast period. Limited historical data and variability in daily patterns led to prioritizing simplicity over complex models.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Strong daily seasonality with distinct hourly patterns",
    "Significant day-to-day variability (e.g., last historical day showed entirely positive daytime values)",
    "Use of hourly averaging to smooth out daily variations",
    "Explicit consideration of missing value implications despite no gaps in provided data",
    "Trade-off between model complexity and limited historical data (4 days)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern analysis and method comparison, but ultimately implements a straightforward solution. Includes multi-step validation of assumptions about seasonality and data completeness.",
