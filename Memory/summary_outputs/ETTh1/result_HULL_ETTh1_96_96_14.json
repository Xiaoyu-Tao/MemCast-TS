  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging due to limited historical records (96 hourly points). It prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints prevent more complex modeling. The method focuses on computational feasibility and pattern stability, resulting in a baseline forecast by repeating averaged hourly patterns.",
