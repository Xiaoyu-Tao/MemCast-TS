  "overall_summary": "The reasoning primarily employs simple averaging of historical data to forecast future values, focusing on daily seasonality patterns while addressing anomalies like a constant-value day (suspected holiday). The approach balances data limitations (small dataset) with practical assumptions, opting for heuristic methods over complex models due to insufficient seasonal data for robust statistical modeling.",
