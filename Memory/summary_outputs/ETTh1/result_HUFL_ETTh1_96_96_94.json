  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging method due to data constraints. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality, handling data completeness, and generating multi-step forecasts through hourly pattern repetition. The approach prioritizes explainability and simplicity given the limited historical data and text-based constraints.",
