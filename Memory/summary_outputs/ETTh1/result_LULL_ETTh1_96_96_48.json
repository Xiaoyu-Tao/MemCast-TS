  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 hours of transformer load data. Given only 4 days of hourly data (Monday to Thursday), the analyst identifies daily seasonality but notes insufficient data for weekly patterns. The solution uses a simple averaging heuristic per hour across available days, repeated for the forecast period. The approach pragmatically addresses data limitations while maintaining computational simplicity, with thorough consideration of datetime alignment, rounding protocols, and acknowledgment of potential weekend pattern limitations.",

    "Hourly pattern averaging as primary forecasting method due to limited data",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method evaluation (including rejected alternatives like Seasonal Naive and Holt-Winters), multi-step computational logic for hourly averages, and datetime handling. Balances sophistication with practical constraints of small dataset.",
