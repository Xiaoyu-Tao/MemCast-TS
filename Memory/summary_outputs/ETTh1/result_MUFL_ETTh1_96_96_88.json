  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analysis of time-series forecasting for hourly transformer load data with daily seasonality. It evaluates multiple methods under data constraints (limited 4-day history), ultimately developing a custom heuristic approach that combines pattern averaging with transition adjustments. The reasoning is detailed but pragmatic, focusing on manually computable solutions due to the inability to run models directly.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Transition adjustments are critical for maintaining consistency between days (e.g., +2.12 jump from 23:00 to 00:00)",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simplified methods over complex models",
    "Hourly averaging requires normalization to account for daily level differences",
    "Trend components may be negligible compared to seasonal patterns in short-term forecasts"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step heuristic development, including pattern decomposition, transition analysis, and shift adjustments, while balancing statistical concepts with practical constraints.",
