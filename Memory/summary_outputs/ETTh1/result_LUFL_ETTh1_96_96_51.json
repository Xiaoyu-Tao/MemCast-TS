{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to short-term hourly forecasting with missing value handling. Key elements include careful anomaly detection, median-based imputation using same-hour historical values, and a robust median-of-medians forecasting approach to account for limited data (4 days) and potential holiday effects. The analysis shows strong pattern recognition of daily seasonality and thoughtful consideration of data limitations.",
