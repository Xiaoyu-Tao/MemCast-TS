  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness given limited historical data (96 points), methodically evaluating seasonal naive, exponential smoothing, and averaging methods before selecting hourly averaging. The process includes data inspection, pattern recognition, method justification, detailed computation, and output formatting, resulting in a practical solution that handles seasonality while accommodating potential data volatility.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Volatility in hourly values",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Absence of missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Averaging same-hour values across historical days smooths anomalies and captures daily patterns",
    "Limited data (4 days) favors simple methods over complex models",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data format (3 decimals) ensures consistency",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern for the forecast horizon simplifies multi-day projections",
    "Daily average analysis reveals volatility but no consistent trend direction"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with emphasis on data-driven heuristics: involves pattern recognition, multi-method evaluation, statistical averaging, and output formatting, but avoids advanced modeling due to data constraints.",
