  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a heuristic approach combining seasonal pattern extraction and trend projection. It identifies daily seasonality in hourly data and computes a linear trend from daily averages, then applies additive adjustments to the most recent day's pattern for forecasting. The method is practical for constrained environments but relies on manual calculations and approximations.",
