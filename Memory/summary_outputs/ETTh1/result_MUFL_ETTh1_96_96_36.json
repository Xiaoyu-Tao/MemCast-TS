  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity and robustness given the constraints, focusing on daily seasonality detection and rejecting complex models like SARIMA due to insufficient training data. The analysis is thorough, covering data inspection, pattern identification, method justification, and detailed implementation steps.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Stable hourly patterns with minor inter-day variations",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Potential weak downward trend (insufficient to model)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity (daily averaging) over complex models when data is limited (4 days)",
    "Explicit handling of decimal precision to match input data format",
    "Acknowledgment of unmodeled weekly patterns due to data limitations",
    "Robust treatment of potential missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data examination, multi-step justification for method selection, and precise computational implementation, but constrained by pragmatic simplifications due to data limitations.",
