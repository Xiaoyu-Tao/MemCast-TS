  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It begins by evaluating advanced methods like SARIMA and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing but ultimately adopts a simplified weighted average technique due to data constraints. The method prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while emphasizing recent observations, resulting in a computationally efficient solution that addresses the challenge of forecasting 96 future points from only 4 days of history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal variation)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "Complete data in provided history (no missing values)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour period) is the dominant pattern and primary forecasting basis",
    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex model applicability, favoring simpler heuristics",
    "Recent data receives higher weighting (0.1→0.4) to prioritize newer patterns",
    "Forecast generation via repeating computed daily pattern for future days",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity for future timestamps"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate initial complexity with statistical model consideration, transitioning to practical heuristics. Balances seasonality analysis and data limitations through weighted averaging, avoiding computationally intensive methods due to minimal training data.",
