  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a hybrid approach combining heuristic analysis and statistical methods to handle short-term hourly data with evident daily seasonality and a moderate upward trend. The analyst prioritizes simplicity to avoid overfitting, manually decomposing the series into trend and seasonal components using linear regression for trend projection and averaging hourly deviations for seasonality. While advanced models like SARIMA are considered, the limited data leads to a custom additive model focusing on interpretability and basic statistical principles.",
