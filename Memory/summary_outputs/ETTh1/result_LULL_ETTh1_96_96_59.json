  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. Given the limited historical data (only 4 days) and a long forecast horizon (96 steps), the analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex models. The solution focuses on identifying patterns, handling data constraints, and implementing a heuristic method that captures daily cycles while acknowledging data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (repeating 24-hour patterns)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimal places",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided window)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA/ETS",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality when trends are absent",
    "Rounding forecasts to match original data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Timestamp generation for multi-day forecasts requires calendar awareness (e.g., non-leap year)",
    "Explicit handling of the forecast horizon (96 steps) through pattern repetition"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data pattern analysis and practical constraints. Balances statistical considerations (seasonality detection, averaging) with heuristic implementation, avoiding computationally intensive models due to data limitations.",
