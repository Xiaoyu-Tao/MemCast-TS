  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focusing on daily seasonality and anomaly handling. It identifies a clear 24-hour temperature pattern, excludes an anomalous constant-value day, and forecasts using a simple average of valid days' hourly profiles. The method prioritizes interpretability over complex models, addressing missing data through heuristic exclusion and pattern repetition.",
