  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical points (96 hours). It prioritizes simplicity by leveraging clear daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging data constraints. The model evaluates but rejects complex methods like ETS or ARIMA due to insufficient data, opting instead for a straightforward hourly averaging technique. Key considerations include handling potential weekly patterns (discarded due to lack of data), rounding conventions, and date sequence generation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Pattern repetition: high values at night/evening, morning drop",
    "Absence of missing values in historical data",
    "Limited historical depth (4 days) constraining model complexity"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging across identical time slots as a reliable method for short-term forecasts with strong daily seasonality",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (ETS/ARIMA) due to limited historical points",
    "Consideration and dismissal of weekly patterns owing to insufficient data coverage",
    "Data rounding to match original precision (3 decimal places) for consistency",
    "Repetition of averaged daily patterns for multi-day forecasts without trend adjustment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning with thorough data inspection and method evaluation, but ultimately implements simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of patterns, alternative method comparisons, and detailed computational steps for hourly averages.",
