  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (4 days). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality, acknowledges data constraints like the absence of weekend patterns, and selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The approach is systematic, with detailed hourly calculations, but highlights challenges in handling potential trends and external factors like weekends.",
