  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a cautious, step-by-step approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes handling potential data limitations, identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, and selects a simple seasonal naive method due to insufficient data for complex models. The process emphasizes practical implementation over theoretical complexity.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Seasonal Naive": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No significant trend observed",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Consistent 3-decimal precision in values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Daily seasonality is the primary exploitable pattern for forecasting",
    "The last observed day provides the most relevant pattern for near-term forecasts",
    "Practical implementation constraints (e.g., output formatting) influence solution design"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis that simplifies to basic heuristics due to data limitations. Includes multi-step evaluation of seasonality, trend analysis, and method comparisons before settling on a simple, implementable solution.",
