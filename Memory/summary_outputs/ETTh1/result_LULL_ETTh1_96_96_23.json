  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting a short time series with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical data (4 days), rejecting complex models like SARIMA in favor of a practical hourly averaging method. The analysis includes thorough data inspection, method comparison, and detailed computation of hourly averages, with careful rounding to match input precision.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (intra-day patterns)",
    "Day-to-day variations in hourly values",
    "No missing values in provided data",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA/Holt-Winters",
    "Hourly averaging across days effectively captures daily seasonality while smoothing anomalies",
    "Explicit handling of precision through rounding forecasted values to match input data format",
    "Consideration of robustness measures (median vs mean) before selecting averaging approach"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines method evaluation with detailed data inspection and manual computation, though constrained by short dataset. Balances statistical awareness with practical implementation.",
