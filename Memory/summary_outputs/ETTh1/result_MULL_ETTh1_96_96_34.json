  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough, multi-step analytical approach focused on identifying patterns and selecting appropriate forecasting methods for short time-series data with daily seasonality. It evaluates multiple techniques, prioritizes handling data limitations, and ultimately implements a decomposition-based method combining linear trend projection with additive seasonal indices.",
