  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple simple methods under computational constraints, and implements a practical solution using averaged daily cycles. The approach prioritizes interpretability and simplicity while addressing data limitations like short history and potential outliers.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Non-stationarity (varying baseline across days)",
    "Day-of-week effects (observed pattern differences between weekdays/weekends)",
    "Complete data (no missing values in input)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of simplicity when constrained by limited data (only 4 days of history)",
    "Explicit handling of outlier days through averaging to mitigate their impact",
    "Hourly pattern replication as a solution for multi-day forecasting",
    "Consideration of day-of-week effects despite insufficient data for modeling",
    "Data rounding and formatting consistency for output generation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications. Features detailed pattern analysis and method evaluation, but ultimately implements straightforward averaging due to data limitations and computational constraints.",
