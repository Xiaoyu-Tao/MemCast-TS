  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical records (96 hourly points). It systematically evaluates multiple methods before selecting a simple averaging technique due to data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality while acknowledging the challenge of capturing longer patterns with minimal data. The solution prioritizes robustness and simplicity, with thorough data validation and rounding for consistency.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher values during night hours (00:00-08:00)",
    "Lower values during daytime hours",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Absence of strong trend over 4-day period"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality (24-hour patterns) as the dominant feature for forecasting",
    "Explicit handling of data limitations: rejection of complex models (ARIMA/ETS) due to insufficient historical data",
    "Validation of data completeness before processing",
    "Hourly averaging across multiple days to smooth daily patterns",
    "Consistent output formatting (timestamp alignment and 3-decimal rounding)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: combines seasonality analysis, multi-method evaluation, and practical simplification. Includes detailed data examination but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to limited data scope.",
