  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analysis for forecasting hourly transformer load data. It identifies daily seasonality and data anomalies through robust statistical methods, primarily using median-based seasonal decomposition. The approach handles data limitations (only 4 days of history) and potential sensor issues by prioritizing robustness over complex modeling, resulting in a practical heuristic solution.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Presence of anomalies/outliers",
    "Drop in baseline level in recent days",
    "Negative values indicating potential sensor issues"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median-based seasonal decomposition provides robustness against anomalies in short time-series data",
    "Limited historical observations (4 days) restrict weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Anomaly detection through daily median comparisons and value distribution analysis",
    "Forecast assumes consistent daily patterns without trend adjustments due to data instability"
