  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting, starting with data inspection and method evaluation before selecting a simple averaging technique. The analyst acknowledges the limitations of short data (96 points) and considers advanced models like Holt-Winters or ARIMA but opts for a heuristic solution. The process is logical but relies heavily on observed patterns without trend adjustment.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Hourly averaging as a baseline method for short-term forecasting with limited data",
