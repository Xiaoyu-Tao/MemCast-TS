  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with a strong focus on data quality issues. It begins by identifying suspicious constant values in the last 24 hours as potential missing data, proceeds through data imputation using hourly averaging, and settles on a simple yet practical forecasting method. The analysis shows careful consideration of alternatives like SARIMA before opting for pattern-based averaging due to data limitations.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Constant values in time-series may indicate missing data requiring imputation",
    "Hourly averaging of corresponding time points is effective for handling daily seasonality",
    "Limited historical data (96 hours) constrains complex model selection",
    "Imputed data may not add new information if derived from existing patterns",
    "Pattern repetition provides viable forecasts when data is insufficient for advanced modeling"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough data diagnostics and method evaluation, though ultimately employs simplified heuristics due to data constraints. Balances statistical considerations (seasonality, imputation) with practical implementation.",
