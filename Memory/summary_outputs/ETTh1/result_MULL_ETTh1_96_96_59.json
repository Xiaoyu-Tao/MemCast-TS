  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical heuristic method focused on daily pattern recognition due to limited historical context (96 hourly values). While acknowledging potential model limitations with short datasets, it prioritizes simple averaging of hourly values across observed days to handle daily seasonality. The approach demonstrates cautious data validation (checking completeness, date alignment) and pragmatic pattern replication for multi-step forecasting.",
