{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a focused approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data. It identifies strong daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and selects a simple averaging method due to the constraint of having only 4 days of data. The approach prioritizes robustness over complexity, explicitly rejecting advanced models like Holt-Winters because of insufficient seasonal cycles. The analysis includes thorough data validation, detailed computation of hourly averages, and careful handling of timestamps and formatting requirements.",
