  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-term hourly data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness by using averaging techniques to capture diurnal patterns while accounting for potential anomalies. The approach emphasizes data inspection, pattern recognition, and practical implementation over complex statistical models due to limited historical data.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Averaging same-hour observations across multiple days effectively captures daily seasonality while smoothing anomalies",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision maintains consistency",
    "Explicit timestamp generation ensures alignment with original data structure",
    "Inclusion of potential outliers in calculations when contextual justification is absent"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data pattern recognition and practical implementation. Balances statistical reasoning (averaging, anomaly consideration) with operational details like timestamp handling and output formatting, while consciously avoiding over-complex modeling due to data limitations.",
