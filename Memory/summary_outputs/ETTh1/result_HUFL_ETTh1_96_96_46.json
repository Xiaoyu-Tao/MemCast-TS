  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging techniques. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality patterns in hourly data and leverages historical averages for multi-step forecasting. The approach is pragmatic given computational constraints but relies on naive methods without accounting for trends or complex patterns due to limited data.",
