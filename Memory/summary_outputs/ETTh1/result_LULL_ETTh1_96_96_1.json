  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting using limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, handles potential outliers, and selects a median-based aggregation method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes robustness over complexity, emphasizing clear pattern recognition and step-by-step justification while acknowledging limitations like insufficient data for trend confirmation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Outlier detection (e.g., spike at final timestamp)",
    "Possible downward trend (observed but not modeled due to data limitations)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median aggregation per hour to mitigate outlier impact and capture central tendency",
    "Explicit grouping by hour to model daily seasonality patterns",
    "Replication of the computed daily pattern across the entire forecast horizon",
    "Preference for simplicity (median over mean or complex models) due to limited historical data",
    "Data constraints preventing trend modeling or advanced techniques like exponential smoothing"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate: Detailed heuristic reasoning with statistical validation (median calculations), outlier handling, and multi-step justification, but avoids complex models due to data limitations.",
