  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on daily seasonality detection, acknowledges data constraints, and selects a practical averaging method after evaluating alternatives. The analysis shows careful consideration of patterns, potential weekly effects, and rounding precision, though constrained by the small dataset.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal pattern)",
    "Higher load during daytime (7:00-17:00)",
    "Lower load at night",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Potential weekly pattern (unverifiable due to limited data)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Averaging same-hour values across days smooths noise and captures daily patterns",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex models like SARIMA and weekly seasonality analysis",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimals using round-half-to-even for consistency with input data",
    "Explicit handling of date/time alignment for forecast periods",
    "Trade-off between model complexity and data availability drives method selection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, method evaluation, and practical implementation, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data limitations.",
