  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and implementing feasible solutions within constraints. It begins with data inspection, recognizes daily seasonality and irregularities, considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but ultimately adopts a simple averaging method due to the text-based environment limitation. The approach prioritizes baseline heuristics over complex modeling given the limited historical data (96 points).",
