  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited data. After evaluating the feasibility of complex models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analysis concludes that the short 4-day dataset is insufficient for robust parameter estimation. Instead, it adopts a simple averaging method to capture daily seasonality, computes hourly averages across available days, and projects this pattern forward. The approach includes data inspection, pattern recognition, and practical trade-offs between complexity and data limitations.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model application (e.g., SARIMA requires more seasonal cycles)",
    "Hourly averaging is preferred over complex methods for robustness with short histories",
    "Explicit consideration of day-of-week effects, though deemed unmodelable due to insufficient samples",
    "Data rounding and output formatting consistency are critical in final implementation"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Balances advanced method evaluation with practical simplification. Includes multi-step data examination, method comparison, and computational execution, but ultimately defaults to heuristic averaging due to data constraints.",
