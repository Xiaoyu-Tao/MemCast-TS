  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a simple, heuristic-based approach focused on handling short historical data (96 points) and a long forecast horizon (96 points). It prioritizes capturing daily seasonality through averaging, avoiding complex models due to limited data. The approach is pragmatic but lacks advanced statistical techniques or validation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend (due to short data)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over trend analysis given limited historical data",
    "Use of same-hour averaging across multiple days to capture recurring patterns",

    "Explicit handling of forecast horizon length matching historical data length",
    "Data rounding to maintain original precision (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Primarily simple heuristics with basic arithmetic operations; no advanced statistical modeling, parameter tuning, or error analysis. Focuses on practical implementation constraints.",
