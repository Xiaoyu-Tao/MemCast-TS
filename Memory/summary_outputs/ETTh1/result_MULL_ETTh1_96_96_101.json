  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to short-term time-series forecasting using limited data. It focuses on identifying patterns, evaluating method suitability, and implementing a simple baseline solution. The analysis acknowledges data limitations and prioritizes robustness over complexity, resulting in a practical implementation of the seasonal naive method.",
