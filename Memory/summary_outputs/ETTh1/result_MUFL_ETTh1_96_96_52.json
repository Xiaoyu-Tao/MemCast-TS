{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with a focus on handling short data spans and potential missing values. The analyst validates data completeness, identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, and selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days). The approach includes detailed hourly calculations, timestamp generation, and rounding for output consistency, prioritizing practicality over complex models given the constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of negative values influencing model choice",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend due to short data span",
    "Explicit note about potential missing values (though none found)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Validation of data completeness before forecasting",
    "Use of hourly averaging to capture daily seasonality for short-term predictions",
    "Avoidance of multiplicative models due to negative values",
    "Rounding and formatting outputs to match original data precision",
    "Explicit handling of timestamps for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with emphasis on data validation and step-by-step computation. Avoids advanced statistical models (e.g., SARIMA, ETS) due to data limitations, opting for heuristic averaging. Includes detailed pattern extraction and rounding logic.",
