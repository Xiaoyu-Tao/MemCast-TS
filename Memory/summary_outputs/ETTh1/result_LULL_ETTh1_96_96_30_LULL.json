  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on handling anomalies and leveraging observed daily seasonality. It emphasizes practical adaptation to data constraints by excluding an anomalous constant-value day and using a heuristic averaging method. The analysis is thorough but constrained by the small dataset, leading to a simplified solution.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous data (constant-value day) to avoid skewing forecasts",
    "Use of multi-day hourly averaging to capture daily patterns despite limited historical data",
    "Repetition of averaged daily cycles for multi-step forecasting",
    "Explicit consideration of day-of-week effects, though deemed impractical due to insufficient data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed anomaly handling and manual pattern extraction; balances statistical awareness (seasonality, overfitting risks) with pragmatic heuristics due to data limitations.",
