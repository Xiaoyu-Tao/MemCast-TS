  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, prioritizing simplicity and robustness over complex modeling. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but ultimately selects a simple hourly averaging technique due to data constraints, emphasizing interpretability and ease of implementation while acknowledging limitations like the inability to capture trends.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Short data length (only 4 days of history)",
    "Weak or unclear trend direction"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritize daily seasonality over weekly patterns when data spans less than 7 days",
    "Simple averaging per hour provides a stable baseline for very short time series",
    "Trend adjustment is unreliable with minimal historical data (≤4 days)",
    "Reshaping data into hourly groups enables efficient pattern extraction",
    "Seasonal naive methods become impractical when forecast horizon equals historical days"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Starts with advanced model considerations but simplifies to heuristic methods after evaluating data limitations. Includes multi-step validation (data inspection, pattern analysis, method comparison) but final implementation is computationally straightforward.",
