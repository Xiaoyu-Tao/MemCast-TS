  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analysis of the time-series data, starting with data inspection and method evaluation. It explores multiple forecasting approaches including SARIMA, exponential smoothing, and decomposition methods, but ultimately selects a simple heuristic approach due to data limitations and computational constraints. The analysis is detailed but pragmatic, acknowledging the challenges of limited data (only 96 points) and the absence of clear trends.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, but daily levels fluctuate significantly",
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents reliable trend detection or weekly seasonality analysis",
    "Computational constraints favor simple heuristics over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Manual calculations of daily averages revealed no consistent trend across days",
    "The last day's pattern was deemed most relevant for near-term forecasting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis exploring advanced methods, but reverts to simple heuristics due to data limitations and computational constraints.",
