  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process employed a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality in a short historical dataset (96 hourly points). The approach focused on capturing repeating daily patterns by averaging corresponding hours across available days, prioritizing simplicity due to limited data. Analytical steps included seasonality identification, trend checks through min/max analysis, and explicit handling of datetime alignment.",
