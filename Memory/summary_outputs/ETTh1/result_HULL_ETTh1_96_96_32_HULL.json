  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting a short time series with daily seasonality. The forecaster evaluates multiple methods, acknowledges data limitations (4 days of hourly data), and selects a simple averaging technique after considering and rejecting trend-based approaches due to volatility. The process emphasizes practical heuristics over complex models, with thorough data examination and manual calculations.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns are captured through hourly averaging across available days rather than relying on the last observed day",
    "Trend adjustments are unreliable with short data spans (4 days) due to volatile hourly differences",
    "Data rounding to three decimals is critical for output consistency",
    "Seasonality dominates trend considerations in very short-term forecasting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data decomposition concepts, multi-method evaluation, and manual calculations, but prioritizes practical heuristics over statistical models due to constraints.",
