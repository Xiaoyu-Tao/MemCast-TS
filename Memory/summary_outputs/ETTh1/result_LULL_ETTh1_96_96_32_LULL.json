  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling daily seasonality and trend components. It employs a decomposition-based method combining daily pattern averaging with linear trend projection, emphasizing careful data inspection and step-by-step statistical processing. The analysis is thorough but computationally intensive, with manual calculations highlighting practical implementation challenges.",
