{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, focusing on handling anomalies and leveraging daily seasonality. It starts with data completeness checks, identifies a significant anomaly (constant values on 2017-05-31), and systematically evaluates multiple methods before selecting a simple averaging approach. The solution prioritizes robustness over complexity due to limited historical data, resulting in a clear, repeatable pattern for multi-day forecasts.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Anomaly detection (constant value day)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous days (e.g., constant-value periods) to improve forecast accuracy",
    "Averaging same-hour values across non-anomalous days to capture daily seasonality",
    "Repeating the derived daily pattern for the entire forecast horizon",
    "Rounding forecasts to match original data precision (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with heuristic adjustments; combines data inspection, anomaly handling, and pattern-based forecasting. Avoids complex statistical models due to limited data, favoring practical, explainable solutions.",
