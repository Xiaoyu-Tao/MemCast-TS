  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs heuristic methods combined with basic statistical analysis to handle a short time-series dataset with daily seasonality. It focuses on leveraging recent daily patterns while addressing weekday/weekend variations through simple averaging and seasonal naive approaches, prioritizing practicality over complex modeling due to limited historical data.",
