  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes pattern recognition and practical constraints over complex models, focusing on daily/weekly seasonality and handling data limitations through simple replication strategies. The approach is pragmatic but acknowledges uncertainty due to insufficient historical data for robust modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Weekly pattern differentiation (weekdays vs weekends)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of most recent weekday (Monday) as template for future forecasts due to recency and contextual relevance",
    "Explicit handling of data scarcity (only 4 days historical data) by simplifying model selection",
    "Comparative analysis of weekday patterns (Friday vs Monday) to inform forecasting decisions",
    "Rejection of averaging across dissimilar days (weekdays/weekends) to preserve pattern integrity"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Combines data pattern recognition, multiple method evaluations, and contextual justifications, but constrained by data limitations preventing advanced statistical modeling.",
