  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It emphasizes handling daily seasonality and data limitations through simple averaging techniques, while acknowledging challenges like potential weekly patterns and outlier effects. The solution prioritizes practicality over complexity given the constraints.",
