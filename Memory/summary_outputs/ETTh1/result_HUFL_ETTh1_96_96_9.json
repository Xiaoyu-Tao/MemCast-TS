  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96 hours of HUFL data using 96 historical hourly points. The analyst prioritizes handling of daily seasonality and data limitations, ultimately selecting a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The process includes thorough data validation, method evaluation, and output formatting, with emphasis on practical implementation over theoretical optimization.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns with daytime/nighttime variations",
    "Absence of significant long-term patterns (trends)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA or Prophet",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, captured through same-hour averaging",
    "Data completeness eliminates need for imputation in historical records",
    "Forecast repetition leverages stable daily patterns when trend is absent",
    "Precision alignment (3 decimal places) maintains consistency with input data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines method evaluation (SARIMA, Prophet, exponential smoothing) with practical simplification. Features multi-step validation (seasonality detection, missing data checks, rounding logic) but ultimately implements a straightforward averaging solution due to data constraints.",
