  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and adopts a simple averaging method due to the constraint of only 4 days of historical data. The approach prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity, with thorough data validation for missing values and detailed hourly pattern analysis.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24)",
    "Variations in daily load patterns",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Unstable pattern with decreasing trend in final day"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Data constraints (only 4 days) necessitate simple models over complex ones like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit handling of potential missing values through initial data validation",
    "Pattern repetition as a viable strategy when historical data is limited"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial consideration of advanced models with practical simplification. Features detailed pattern analysis, multi-step computational logic for hourly averages, and data quality checks, but avoids complex statistical modeling due to data limitations.",
