  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting a 96-hour time series with clear daily seasonality and a short data history. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling techniques (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data limitations. The approach prioritizes stability and interpretability over complex modeling, with thorough consideration of data characteristics and practical constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Upward trend (increasing values over observed days)",
    "Complete data (no missing values in the input segment)",
    "Negative values during daytime, positive at night"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (4 days) makes complex models like SARIMA over-parameterized and impractical",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality when historical cycles are consistent",
    "Explicit trend modeling (e.g., linear regression per hour) is unreliable with only 4 data points per hour",
    "Data completeness checks precede modeling decisions",
    "Negative value handling requires additive (not multiplicative) seasonality approaches"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, method evaluation, and practical simplification. Balances statistical considerations (seasonality/trend) with heuristic implementation due to data constraints.",
