  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using limited historical data (96 hourly points). It focuses on daily seasonality patterns, acknowledges data constraints, and employs a simple averaging technique due to insufficient history for complex modeling. The approach is transparent and data-driven but constrained by the short observation window.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Consistent negative values during daytime",
    "Less negative/positive values at night",
    "Complete data without missing values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as a fallback for insufficient historical data",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week mismatches between history and forecast period",
    "Precision preservation through rounding to 3 decimal places",
    "Rejection of trend modeling due to limited data scope"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough pattern analysis and method evaluation, but ultimately relies on simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of assumptions and detailed implementation planning.",
