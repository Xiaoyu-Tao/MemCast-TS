  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting a short time-series with daily seasonality, emphasizing robustness to anomalies and data limitations. After considering advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analyst opted for a simple median-based heuristic due to the limited 4-day dataset. The solution prioritizes handling anomalies through hourly medians and assumes constant seasonality while acknowledging potential day-of-week effects.",
