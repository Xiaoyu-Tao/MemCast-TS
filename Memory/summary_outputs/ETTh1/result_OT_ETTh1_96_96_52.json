  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to handling short-term hourly time-series forecasting with limited historical data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, acknowledges data limitations (only 96 points), and selects a simple averaging method due to computational constraints. The approach focuses on capturing recurring daily patterns while explicitly ignoring potential complexities like trend analysis given the short observation window.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Temperature fluctuations (daytime rises, nighttime falls)",
    "No clear long-term directional trend",
    "High hourly variability across days",
    "No missing values in provided data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over trend analysis due to limited data (4 days)",
    "Use of same-hour averaging across multiple days to capture recurring patterns",
    "Explicit handling of precision through rounding forecasts to match input data format (3 decimals)",
    "Rejection of complex models (e.g., ETS, ARIMA) in favor of interpretable heuristics given constraints"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed heuristic approach: Involves data inspection, pattern recognition, and multi-step averaging calculations, but avoids advanced statistical modeling. Complexity arises from manual hourly computations and rounding logic rather than algorithmic sophistication.",
