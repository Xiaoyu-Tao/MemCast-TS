  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on simplicity and seasonality capture. It prioritizes heuristic methods over complex models due to computational constraints, using historical daily patterns to generate forecasts. The approach effectively identifies key data characteristics but simplifies trend/non-stationarity handling through averaging.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of non-stationarity/trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)",
    "Potential outliers in initial observations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern requiring explicit modeling",
    "Averaging same-hour data across multiple days smooths noise and captures seasonality",
    "Forecast horizon matches historical period length enabling pattern repetition",
    "Data completeness verification precedes forecasting",
    "Decimal precision alignment with original data is critical for output"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with emphasis on heuristic methods. Involves data inspection, seasonality identification, and manual calculations, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to stated constraints.",
