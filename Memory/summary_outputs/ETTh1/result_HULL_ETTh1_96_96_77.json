  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analytical approach for short-term time-series forecasting with limited data. It identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling techniques, and develops a robust heuristic solution using hourly medians to handle data constraints and outliers. The analysis is thorough, considering seasonality, day-of-week effects, and practical implementation steps.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Day-of-week variations (e.g., lower loads on Sundays)",
    "Outlier detection (handled via median aggregation)",
    "Data completeness (no missing values in input)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Median aggregation per hour provides robustness against outlier days like Sundays",
    "Repetition of median daily patterns is optimal for short-term forecasts with limited historical data",
    "Day-of-week considerations influence method selection despite insufficient weekly data",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for forecast period generation"
