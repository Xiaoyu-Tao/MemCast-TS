  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying daily seasonality in a 96-hour time-series dataset. It emphasizes data completeness checks, pattern analysis, and simple averaging techniques for forecasting. The approach is pragmatic given the limited data (4 days), with thorough consideration of alternatives like seasonal naive and exponential smoothing before settling on hourly averaging as the most suitable method.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Hourly value fluctuations across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, with consistent hourly fluctuations repeating every 24 hours",
    "Daily averages show no consistent trend (2.048, 2.756, 1.838, 1.405), justifying the averaging approach",
    "Forecasts are generated by repeating averaged hourly values across the forecast horizon",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity ensures accurate timestamp generation for future points",
    "Three-decimal precision maintained for output consistency with input data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with multi-step validation: includes data completeness checks, trend analysis, method comparison (seasonal naive vs. averaging), and manual hourly pattern calculation. Balances statistical reasoning with practical heuristics suitable for small datasets.",
