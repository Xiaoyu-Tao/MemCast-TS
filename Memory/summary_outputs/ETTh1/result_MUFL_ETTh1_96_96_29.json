  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. It identifies daily seasonality and handles data constraints by prioritizing simplicity and robustness. The model avoids complex statistical methods due to the small dataset (96 points), opting instead for a heuristic averaging method that captures the diurnal pattern while acknowledging limitations like the absence of weekend data in the historical record.",
