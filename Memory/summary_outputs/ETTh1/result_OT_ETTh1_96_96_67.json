  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a struggle between the desire to use sophisticated models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) and practical constraints preventing code-based implementation. The expert ultimately resorts to heuristic methods, specifically averaging hourly patterns from historical data, due to environmental limitations. The approach prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while acknowledging data limitations and the trade-off between complexity and feasibility.",
