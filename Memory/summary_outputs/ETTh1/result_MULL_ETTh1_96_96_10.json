  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step approach for forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points. It focuses on identifying patterns, handling potential data issues, and selecting a pragmatic method based on observed daily seasonality. The approach is systematic but relies on simple averaging due to the short 4-day history, with careful consideration of data rounding and formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Potential downward trend (unconfirmed due to short history)",
    "No missing values in the provided segment",
    "Hourly fluctuations with consistent peak/trough timing"

  "key_insights": [
    "Seasonality is addressed by averaging each hour across available days to form a daily pattern",
    "Forecasts are generated by repeating the computed daily pattern for the entire horizon",
    "Values are rounded to 3 decimal places to match input data format",
    "Limited history (96 points) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Daily level adjustments were considered but discarded due to insufficient trend evidence"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, pattern recognition, and multi-step calculations but relies on heuristic averaging rather than advanced statistical models.",
