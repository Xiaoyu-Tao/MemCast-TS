  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach for hourly time-series forecasting using a simple averaging method to capture daily seasonality. The analysis identifies a 24-hour pattern in the data, handles potential missing values through imputation considerations, and calculates hourly averages across historical days. The forecast is generated by repeating the averaged daily pattern for the forecast horizon, with attention to data precision.",
