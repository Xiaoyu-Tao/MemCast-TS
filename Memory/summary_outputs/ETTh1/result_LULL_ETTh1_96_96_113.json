  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach for forecasting hourly time-series data with strong daily seasonality. The analyst identifies clear 24-hour patterns in the 4-day historical data and prioritizes simplicity due to the short data length, ultimately selecting a straightforward averaging method. The approach includes data completeness verification, pattern analysis, and output formatting considerations, balancing efficiency with seasonality capture.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality dominates the pattern, making hourly averaging effective",
    "Short data length (96 points) limits complex model applicability",
    "Level adjustment considered but rejected due to insufficient trend evidence",
    "Output precision must match input (3 decimal places with rounding)",
    "Forecast horizon (96 hours) matches exactly 4 seasonal cycles"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves seasonality identification, method comparison (seasonal naive, exponential smoothing), and detailed hourly calculations, but simplifies to averaging due to data constraints.",
