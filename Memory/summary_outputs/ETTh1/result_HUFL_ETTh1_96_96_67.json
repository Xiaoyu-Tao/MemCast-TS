  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 future values using a 4-day hourly time series with daily seasonality. Analysts prioritized simple methods due to limited data size (96 points), ultimately selecting a 24-hour pattern averaging approach. While multiple models were considered (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), the solution emphasized practicality given data constraints, with thorough evaluation of pattern consistency and outlier impacts.",
