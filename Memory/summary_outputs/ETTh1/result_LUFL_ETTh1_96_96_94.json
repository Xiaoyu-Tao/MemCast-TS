  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data with limited historical data (96 points). The analyst identifies strong daily seasonality but insufficient data for weekly patterns, leading to a practical choice of simple averaging over complex models. The approach is data-constrained but logically structured, with thorough consideration of seasonality, data completeness, and day-of-week effects.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Evening peaks (around 20:00)",
    "Lower nighttime/morning values",
    "Day-of-week magnitude variations (e.g., higher Saturday peaks)",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided points)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts weekly seasonality modeling despite observed day-of-week variations",
    "Hourly averaging provides a viable baseline when advanced models aren't feasible",
    "Explicit handling of timestamp continuity and rounding conventions",
    "Trade-off between pattern accuracy and data limitations drives method selection",
    "Forecast assumes consistent daily patterns despite differing days-of-week"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines advanced model awareness (SARIMA, Holt-Winters) with pragmatic simplification due to data constraints. Features multi-step validation of seasonality, data gaps, and calendar effects before settling on heuristic solution.",
