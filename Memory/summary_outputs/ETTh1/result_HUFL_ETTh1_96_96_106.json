  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on forecasting hourly time-series data with potential anomalies and limited historical data (96 points). The analyst initially considers SARIMA for its seasonal capabilities but pivots to a heuristic approach using hourly averages from non-anomalous days, adjusted by recent trends. Key challenges include handling a suspicious constant-value day, addressing limited seasonal cycles, and managing the absence of true missing values in training data.",
