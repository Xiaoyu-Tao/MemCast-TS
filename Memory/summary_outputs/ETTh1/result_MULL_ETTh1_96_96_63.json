  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, prioritizing simplicity due to the constraints of having only 96 historical points. The analyst identifies daily seasonality but acknowledges data limitations prevent complex modeling, ultimately selecting a simple averaging method after evaluating alternatives like SARIMA and exponential smoothing. The approach includes data validation, pattern recognition, and practical implementation considerations like rounding.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent time-of-day patterns (negative afternoons, positive nights)",
    "No missing values in provided segment"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Daily patterns can be captured through same-hour averaging when data is scarce",
    "Data granularity (hourly) requires seasonality period alignment (24 hours)",
    "Forecast horizon matching historical length enables pattern replication",
    "Output formatting consistency (rounding, date sequencing) is critical"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Detailed evaluation of model trade-offs and data patterns, but simplifies to heuristic implementation due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, data completeness, and practical output considerations.",
