  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, starting with consideration of advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately adopting a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The analysis shows thorough pattern examination and method justification, though the solution prioritizes simplicity and feasibility over statistical sophistication given the 4-day dataset.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Irregular daily patterns without clear trends",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Hourly fluctuations with daytime peaks and nighttime dips"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (96 points) necessitates simplified methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging effectively smooths day-to-day variations for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit handling of rounding conventions (3 decimal places) to match input data",
    "Rejection of naive seasonal repetition in favor of averaged daily profiles"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data inspection and method comparison, but ultimately simplified to heuristic implementation due to data limitations.",
