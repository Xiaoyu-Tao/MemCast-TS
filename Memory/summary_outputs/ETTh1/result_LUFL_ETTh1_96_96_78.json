  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on handling daily seasonality and anomalies in limited historical data (4 days). The analyst identified a 24-hour pattern but excluded an anomalous Friday from calculations. Forecasts were generated using simple averaging of same-hour values from three normal days (Tue-Thu), repeated for 4 days. The approach prioritizes robustness over complex modeling due to data limitations and uncertainty about weekend patterns.",

    "Exclusion of anomalous Friday data improved pattern consistency",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: combines pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and calendar-aware considerations. Balances statistical methods (seasonal averaging) with practical heuristics for missing context, while maintaining simplicity in final implementation through pattern repetition.",
