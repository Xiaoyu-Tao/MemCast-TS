  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under constraints. It begins by exploring advanced methods like Exponential Smoothing and SARIMA but ultimately adopts a simple averaging technique due to data limitations (only 96 points) and the inability to execute code. The analysis shows awareness of seasonality and data anomalies but prioritizes feasibility, resulting in a straightforward solution.",

    "Anomaly detection in the last day's data and its impact on forecasting",
    "Data formatting consistency (rounding to match input precision)"
