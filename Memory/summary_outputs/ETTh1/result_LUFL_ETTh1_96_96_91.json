  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on daily seasonality patterns and data limitations. While considering advanced models like SARIMA, it ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to the short 4-day dataset. The solution prioritizes interpretability and pattern repetition over complex statistical techniques, acknowledging constraints while maintaining logical consistency.",
