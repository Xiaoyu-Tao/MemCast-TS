  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-term hourly data with potential missing values. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for a heuristic method after evaluating but dismissing more complex models due to limited historical data. Key strengths include thorough data inspection, consideration of seasonality, and meticulous attention to output formatting requirements.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of outliers (notably low values on 2017-09-12)",
    "Negative value handling",
    "Consistent hourly patterns despite daily variations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data histories (4 days) limit complex model applicability",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality patterns",
    "Output formatting precision is critical (6-decimal places, timestamp alignment)",
    "Robustness considerations (mean vs. median for outlier handling)",
    "Explicit validation of data completeness before processing"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Combines initial consideration of advanced models (SARIMA, LSTM) with practical simplification. Features multi-step validation (seasonality checks, outlier inspection), detailed computational steps, and rigorous output formatting, but ultimately implements a straightforward averaging heuristic due to data constraints.",
