  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on simplicity and seasonality capture. It prioritizes straightforward methods like hourly averaging due to limited historical points (96), explicitly avoiding complex models to prevent overfitting. The analysis systematically addresses data completeness, seasonality patterns, and computational steps while maintaining awareness of potential missing value challenges.",
