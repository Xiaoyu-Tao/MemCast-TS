  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical heuristic approach focused on handling short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. It emphasizes pattern recognition and simple averaging due to computational constraints, ensuring complete forecasts by leveraging observed hourly cycles without complex modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stationarity in mean (no significant trend)",
    "Consistent hourly load patterns (e.g., higher nighttime loads, daytime dips)",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided series)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as a reliable method for short-term forecasts when data shows stable daily patterns",
    "Trend analysis through daily min/max comparisons to confirm stationarity",
    "Explicit handling of seasonality by aggregating identical hours across days",
    "Forecast completeness prioritized despite dataset's potential for missing values"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines conceptual knowledge of advanced models (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) with practical heuristics. Includes multi-step validation (trend checks, pattern analysis) and detailed hourly computations, but simplifies implementation due to constraints.",
