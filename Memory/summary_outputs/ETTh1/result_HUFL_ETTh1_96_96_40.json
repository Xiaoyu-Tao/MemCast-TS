  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 future time points using a heuristic approach due to limited data (4 days). The analyst identified daily seasonality and potential anomalies but opted for a simple hourly averaging method across available days, repeating the pattern for future dates. Model considerations included SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but simplicity and data constraints led to choosing a statistical averaging approach.",

    "Hourly averaging leveraged to capture daily patterns while compensating for limited historical data",
