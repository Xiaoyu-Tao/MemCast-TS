  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identifies patterns, evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, decomposition), but ultimately implements a simple averaging technique due to limited historical data (4 days). The approach is logical and data-driven, though constrained by the small dataset, resulting in a practical but potentially oversimplified solution.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "No missing values",
    "Consistent hourly fluctuations (lower loads at night, higher during day)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hourly averaging a viable approach",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling and trend detection",
    "Averaging per hour across days captures recurring patterns efficiently",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision maintains consistency",
    "Repeating the daily profile simplifies forecasting for identical horizons"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with statistical considerations (e.g., SARIMA evaluation) but ultimately reverts to simple heuristics due to data limitations. Involves multi-step validation, pattern analysis, and computational rigor in hourly averaging.",
