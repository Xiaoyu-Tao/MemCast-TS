  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to forecast hourly time-series data, prioritizing practicality given the short 4-day input span and computational constraints. While considering advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, it defaults to hourly averaging across historical days due to unclear trends, minimal data length, and the need for manual calculation. The approach demonstrates reasonable pattern recognition but lacks sophisticated trend analysis.",

    "Negative values necessitate additive rather than multiplicative models",

Shows awareness of advanced statistical methods but deliberately selects simple averaging due to data limitations and simulated environment constraints, with detailed hourly pattern calculations.",
