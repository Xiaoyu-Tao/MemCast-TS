  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on handling daily seasonality in a short 4-day time series with no missing values. The primary approach uses simple averaging method per hourly slot across available days, acknowledging limitations in detecting weekly patterns due to insufficient historical data. The analysis demonstrates practical adaptation to data constraints through straightforward heuristics rather than complex models.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging preferred over complex models due to limited 4-day history",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for multi-day forecasting",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately structured analysis combining basic statistical methods with domain-aware heuristics. Features multi-step validation of assumptions about data patterns and method suitability, but ultimately implements simple arithmetic operations for prediction generation.",
