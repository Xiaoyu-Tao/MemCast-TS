  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical points (96 hours). The model prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for a daily-seasonality-based averaging method over complex statistical models due to data constraints. It carefully considers data characteristics like missing value handling and pattern stability while acknowledging limitations in capturing weekly patterns or trends with only 4 days of data.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Starts with advanced model considerations (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) but simplifies to heuristic averaging after evaluating data limitations. Includes multi-step validation, pattern analysis, and implementation details while maintaining computational feasibility.",
