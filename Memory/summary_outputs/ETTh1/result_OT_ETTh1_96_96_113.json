  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying patterns like daily seasonality and downward trends, then develops a custom heuristic method combining seasonal averaging and level adjustment. The analysis is thorough but acknowledges data limitations, favoring simplicity over complex models like SARIMA or Holt-Winters due to the short history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Downward trend in daily averages",

  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Seasonal patterns are calculated via hourly averages across multiple days",
    "Recent data levels (last day's average) prioritized for base forecasting",
    "Trend projection avoided due to stabilization in last two days",
    "Additive seasonality preferred over multiplicative due to amplitude changes",
    "Data limitations (4 days) constrain model complexity"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: involves data inspection, trend quantification, seasonal decomposition, and custom heuristic development, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
