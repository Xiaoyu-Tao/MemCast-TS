  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on simplicity and seasonality capture. The analyst identifies a clear daily pattern in hourly oil temperature data, acknowledges potential missing values (though absent in the provided data), and selects a computationally lightweight method suitable for the constraints. The process emphasizes data inspection, pattern recognition, and pragmatic trade-offs between trend sensitivity and implementation simplicity.",
