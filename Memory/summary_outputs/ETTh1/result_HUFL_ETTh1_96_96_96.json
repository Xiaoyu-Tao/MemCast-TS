  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach focused on daily seasonality and simple averaging techniques. The analyst identified clear 24-hour patterns, considered potential missing values (though none were present), and evaluated multiple forecasting methods before settling on hourly averaging across 4 historical days. The approach prioritizes stability over trend detection, using smoothing to handle outliers while maintaining computational simplicity.",

    "Used 4-day hourly averages to create stable daily profiles",

Implemented detailed hourly calculations but avoided advanced statistical modeling due to hypothetical implementation constraints.",
