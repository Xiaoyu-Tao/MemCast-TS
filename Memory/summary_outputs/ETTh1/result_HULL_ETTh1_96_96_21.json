{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data (96 hourly points) with daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and robustness by using hourly averaging to capture daily patterns, explicitly avoiding complex models like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing due to limited data and overfitting concerns. The method involves thorough data inspection, pattern identification, and careful handling of data formatting and rounding.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Using hourly averages across days as forecasts preserves daily patterns while mitigating noise",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods to avoid overfitting",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input data precision",
    "Repeating the same hourly profile for all forecasted days is sufficient without trend adjustment",
    "Explicit handling of datetime generation ensures correct forecast alignment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data grouping and heuristic calculations, but avoids advanced statistical modeling. Focuses on practical implementation details like datetime handling and value rounding.",
