{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning focuses on forecasting hourly transformer load using a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days). It prioritizes handling daily seasonality through hourly pattern repetition, dismissing more complex models like SARIMA or Holt-Winters due to insufficient data length. The approach emphasizes practicality over statistical complexity while maintaining consistency with observed stable daily patterns.",
