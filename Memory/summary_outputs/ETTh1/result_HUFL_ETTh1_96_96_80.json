  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality. Using only 4 days of hourly data, the analyst implemented a simple yet effective averaging method per time-of-day bucket. The process included thorough data validation (checking for missing values), pattern recognition, step-by-step computation of hourly averages, and careful rounding to match input precision. The approach prioritized practicality given data constraints while maintaining transparency in calculations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "Absence of missing values in provided data",
    "Lack of significant trend in 4-day window"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour-of-day for seasonal pattern extraction",
    "Using multi-day hourly averages as forecast basis",
    "Explicit handling of decimal precision matching source data",
    "Date sequence generation for future timestamps",
    "Validation of data completeness before processing"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with emphasis on data handling and step-by-step computation. While the core method (hourly averaging) is simple, the reasoning includes thorough pattern analysis, data quality checks, and precise implementation details. Lacks advanced statistical modeling due to limited historical data.",
