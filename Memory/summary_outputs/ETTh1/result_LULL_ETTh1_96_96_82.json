  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identifies diurnal pattern as the dominant feature, considers alternative methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but ultimately selects a simple hourly averaging technique due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The solution emphasizes robustness over complexity, with careful attention to data completeness, timestamp generation, and output formatting.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for short datasets: Hourly averaging preferred over complex models due to limited history",
    "Handling intra-day patterns: Grouping by hour-of-day to capture diurnal seasonality",
    "Data completeness verification: Explicit confirmation of no missing values in input before processing",
    "Output precision management: Rounding forecasts to 3 decimal places to match input format"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition, method evaluation, and detailed implementation planning, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
