  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analytical approach to time-series forecasting, starting with data inspection and method selection before developing a custom heuristic solution. The analyst identifies key patterns, handles potential data issues like missing values, and adapts to constraints by creating a decomposition-based forecasting method. The process is systematic, leveraging statistical techniques and domain considerations for a plausible forecast.",
