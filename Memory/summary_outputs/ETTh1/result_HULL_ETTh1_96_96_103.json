  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analytical approach to time-series forecasting, starting with data inspection and method evaluation before developing a custom solution. It identifies key patterns like daily seasonality and an upward trend, acknowledges data limitations (only 96 points), and adapts when constrained from using preferred statistical models. The solution combines seasonal decomposition with linear trend projection, showing strong problem-solving despite computational constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Upward trend (notably on the last observed day)",
    "Day-of-week effects (e.g., Sunday vs. Monday patterns)",
    "Anomaly detection (spike on 2017-08-20)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Decomposition into seasonal and trend components is essential for handling hourly data with daily patterns",
    "Linear regression on daily averages effectively projects trend direction despite limited data",
    "Averaging hourly values across multiple days mitigates anomalies in seasonal indices",
    "Trend adjustments must account for deviations from historical averages in multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: integrates data diagnostics, method comparison, manual statistical calculations (daily averages, linear regression), and custom forecasting logic.",
