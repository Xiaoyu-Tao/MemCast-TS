  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple yet practical approach focused on daily seasonality and data limitations. By analyzing 4 days of hourly data, the model prioritizes avoiding overfitting through a seasonal naive method with hourly averaging. Key considerations include handling potential outliers, recognizing insufficient data for weekly patterns, and balancing simplicity against statistical complexity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Occasional outliers (e.g., sudden value drops)",
    "Non-constant variance across days",
    "Limited historical data constraints"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized simplicity over complex models due to small dataset (4 days)",
    "Used multi-day hourly averages to smooth anomalies and capture daily patterns",
    "Recognized limitations in detecting weekly trends from short data history",
    "Balanced outlier inclusion vs. pattern consistency in feature engineering"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis (SARIMA/ETS consideration) transitioning to practical implementation of heuristic averaging. Features detailed pattern examination and error propagation considerations while maintaining executable simplicity.",
