  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging method. It begins with data inspection for missing values and seasonality detection, identifies constraints like limited data size (96 points), and selects an appropriate forecasting technique. The method focuses on practicality by leveraging observed daily patterns while acknowledging potential limitations in trend capture. The execution includes detailed computation, rounding conventions, and output formatting, resulting in a clear, reproducible forecast.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Non-stationarity in data",
    "Absence of missing values in training data",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Leveraging daily seasonality by averaging corresponding hours across historical days",
    "Prioritizing simplicity due to limited data (4 days) over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Explicit handling of data granularity (hourly) and forecast horizon (96 steps)",
    "Rounding outputs to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Robust date-time handling for multi-day forecasting"
