  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). Initial considerations for advanced models like SARIMA were abandoned due to data constraints, leading to a simple yet effective hourly averaging method. The approach prioritizes capturing daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging limitations in trend detection and handling of potential data gaps.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Handling of missing values (though none present)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model application",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality patterns",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for forecasting periods",
    "Consistent output formatting requirements (6 decimal places)",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate initial complexity with SARIMA consideration, shifting to simple heuristics due to data limitations. Focused on practical implementation over theoretical optimization.",
