  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on forecasting hourly data with daily seasonality, emphasizing cautious handling of potential missing values and selecting appropriate models given limited historical data (96 points). The analysis explores multiple methods but converges on a simple averaging approach due to data constraints, leveraging daily pattern repetition while acknowledging uncertainty in trend estimation.",
