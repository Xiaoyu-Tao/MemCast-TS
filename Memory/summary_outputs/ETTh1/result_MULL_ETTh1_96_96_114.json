  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term hourly forecasting using limited historical data. It begins by evaluating data characteristics and potential methods, then selects a simple averaging technique due to constraints and data limitations. The analysis prioritizes robustness over complexity, focusing on daily patterns while acknowledging the inability to capture weekly seasonality with the available data.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Negative values (precluding multiplicative models)",
    "Complete data (no missing values in history)",
    "Pattern consistency across days (despite weekday variations)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited history (4 days) restricts weekly seasonality modeling, favoring daily pattern reliance",
    "Negative values necessitate additive rather than multiplicative approaches",
    "Trade-offs between model complexity and data constraints drive method selection",
    "Hourly averaging provides robustness for short-term forecasts with minimal trend",
    "Careful rounding protocols maintain data integrity in final outputs"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Balances advanced method consideration (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) with practical simplification. Includes detailed data inspection, pattern analysis, and computational precision, but simplifies to heuristic implementation due to constraints.",
