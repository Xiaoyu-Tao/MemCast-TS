  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach focused on handling missing values and daily seasonality in short-term forecasting. Key steps include anomaly detection in a constant-value day, imputation using adjacent days' averages, and leveraging hourly patterns. While initially considering advanced methods like SARIMA and STL decomposition, the final approach prioritizes practicality through simple averaging due to limited data length, resulting in a repetitive daily pattern forecast.",
