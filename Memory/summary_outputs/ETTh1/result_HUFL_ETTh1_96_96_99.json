  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting a short time series with daily seasonality. The analyst evaluates multiple methods before selecting a simple hourly averaging technique due to data limitations (only 4 days of history). The approach prioritizes practicality, acknowledging challenges like potential missing values and the difficulty of capturing trends with limited data, while maintaining focus on seasonality as the dominant pattern.",

    "Daily seasonality (diurnal variation)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short history (4 days) limits complex model application (e.g., SARIMA/Holt-Winters) due to insufficient seasonal cycles",
    "Hourly averaging provides a robust baseline for daily seasonal patterns with minimal data",
    "Forecast horizon length (96 steps) relative to history requires cautious method selection",
    "Explicit handling of data granularity (24-hour cycles) is critical for accurate forecasting",
    "Trend detection is unreliable with only 4 days of data, favoring pattern-based methods"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines method evaluation (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) with practical constraints, detailed data inspection, and manual hourly calculations, but ultimately implements a straightforward averaging solution.",
