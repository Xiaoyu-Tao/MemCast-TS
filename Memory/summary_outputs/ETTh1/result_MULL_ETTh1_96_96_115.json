  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying patterns and selecting an appropriate method. It starts by recognizing daily seasonality and non-stationarity, evaluates complex models like SARIMA and exponential smoothing but opts for a simpler decomposition method due to data constraints. The approach combines linear trend projection for daily levels with average hourly deviations, balancing robustness and interpretability while acknowledging limitations of the small dataset.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex model usage and necessitates simpler, interpretable methods.",
    "Additive decomposition is preferred over multiplicative models due to negative values in the data.",
    "Combining daily trend projection with intraday pattern averaging provides a practical solution for short-term forecasts.",
    "Handling unseen days of the week introduces uncertainty as historical patterns may not directly apply."
