  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short-term hourly data with clear daily patterns. While advanced models like SARIMA and Prophet were considered, the analysis ultimately adopted a simple averaging method due to limited data availability (4 days). The process shows strong pattern recognition capabilities but acknowledges limitations in trend detection and weekly seasonality modeling.",
