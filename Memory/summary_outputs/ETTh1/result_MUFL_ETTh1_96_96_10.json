  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and practicality, opting for a straightforward averaging method over complex models due to limited data points. The process includes thorough data inspection, method justification, manual calculations with rounding precision, and careful result formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Load drops during daytime and rises at night",
    "Variation in daily patterns across the observed period"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simple models over complex ones like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Data rounding precision must match input specifications (3 decimals)",
    "Forecast horizon requires exact date sequence generation",
    "Most recent data patterns should be considered for representativeness"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on practical constraints: combines pattern recognition, method selection rationale, and manual calculations, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations.",
