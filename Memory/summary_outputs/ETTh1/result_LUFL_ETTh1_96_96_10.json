  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a moderately complex analysis focused on identifying daily seasonality and handling limited data constraints. The approach prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, using heuristic methods to address weekly patterns despite insufficient historical context. Key strengths include thorough data inspection and pattern recognition, though the solution relies on basic averaging due to data limitations.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Day-of-week analysis is critical but limited by insufficient historical data (only one Saturday available)",
    "Averaging same-hour values across multiple days provides a stable baseline for daily patterns",
    "Forecasting multiple seasonal periods (4 days) with minimal history requires simplified approaches",
    "Data rounding precision must match input specifications (3 decimal places)",
    "Hourly pattern consistency outweighs daily level fluctuations in this context"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data inspection and multi-step heuristic reasoning, though constrained to simple averaging due to limited historical data. Includes day-of-week analysis, pattern recognition, and computational precision considerations.",
