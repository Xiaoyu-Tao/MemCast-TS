  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach focused on handling short-term hourly time-series data with clear daily patterns. It employs a simple, pragmatic method leveraging observed seasonality due to limited historical data and environmental constraints, emphasizing data completeness checks and pattern replication for multi-step forecasting.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal variation)",
    "No missing values in training data",
    "Short-term data limitations",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour to compute averages captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Data completeness checks are prioritized before analysis",
    "Short history limits trend adjustment, favoring stationary pattern assumptions",
    "Output formatting must align with input specifications (e.g., decimal precision)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed step-by-step reasoning using simple heuristics, avoiding complex models due to data constraints. Focuses on practical implementation over statistical sophistication.",
