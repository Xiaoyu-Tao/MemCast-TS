  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on simplicity and recency, prioritizing straightforward methods over complex models due to implementation constraints. It acknowledges potential data issues like missing values but adapts to the complete provided dataset, ultimately selecting a seasonal naive forecast method based on the most recent daily pattern.",
