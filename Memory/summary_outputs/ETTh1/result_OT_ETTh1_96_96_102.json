  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on forecasting 96 hourly Oil Temperature values using a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days) and suspected daily seasonality. The approach emphasizes practicality given constraints, opting for hourly averages over more complex models like SARIMA or Prophet, while acknowledging potential presence of outliers and data limitations.",
