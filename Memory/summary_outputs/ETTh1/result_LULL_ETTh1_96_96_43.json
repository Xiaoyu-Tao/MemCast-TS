  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analysis of a 96-hour time series with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited data, exploring methods like seasonal naive, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA before settling on a custom heuristic approach. Key steps include identifying patterns, computing daily averages, testing trend adjustments, and developing a scaled averaging method. The reasoning is thorough but constrained by the short historical window, leading to a practical solution that emphasizes pattern repetition and level adjustment.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, validated through hourly data inspection across multiple days.",
    "Trend modeling (e.g., linear regression) is unreliable with only 4 days of data, leading to rejection of complex adjustments.",
    "Final method combines same-hour averaging across 4 days with scaling to match the last day's average level.",
    "Forecast repeats the scaled daily pattern identically for all future days due to lack of weekly data or clear trend continuation."

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Integrates data inspection, statistical calculations (daily averages, scaling factors), and iterative method evaluation, though constrained by data limitations.",
