  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, starting with advanced model considerations (SARIMA) but defaulting to a simple averaging method due to simulation limitations. It effectively identifies daily seasonality and handles data characteristics, though the solution prioritizes feasibility over statistical sophistication. The forecast is generated by computing hourly averages from historical data and repeating the pattern.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Negative values with intermittent positive spikes",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is addressed by averaging corresponding hours across historical days",
    "Data stationarity and trend analysis are considered but deferred due to implementation constraints",
    "Forecast simplicity is prioritized when advanced modeling isn't feasible",
    "Data rounding maintains consistency with original precision",
    "Hourly patterns are reused for multi-day forecasts when minimal historical data exists"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial statistical considerations (SARIMA, decomposition) with practical heuristics. Features multi-step validation of data patterns and detailed hourly calculations, but simplifies execution due to simulated constraints.",
