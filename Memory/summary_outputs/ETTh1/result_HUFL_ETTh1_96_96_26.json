  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to forecasting 96-hour HUFL data using 4-day historical data. It begins by assessing data completeness and seasonality patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options (SARIMA, seasonal naive, averaging), and selects a simple averaging method due to limited data and absence of clear trends. The approach emphasizes practical implementation with data rounding and formatting considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Variation in hourly patterns across days",
    "Absence of clear trend in daily averages",
    "Data completeness in provided samples"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents modeling weekly seasonality or complex trends",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days creates a stable daily profile for multi-day forecasting",
    "Rounding forecasted values to match original data precision (3 decimals) is critical",
    "Seasonal naive models may underperform when daily patterns vary significantly"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines statistical analysis (seasonality detection, stationarity consideration) with practical simplifications due to data constraints, ending with straightforward implementation.",
