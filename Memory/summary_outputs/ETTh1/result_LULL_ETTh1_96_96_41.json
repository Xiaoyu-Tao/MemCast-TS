  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using simple averaging to handle daily seasonality. It emphasizes data completeness checks, acknowledges potential model limitations with limited historical data, and systematically computes hourly averages for multi-day forecasts. The method prioritizes robustness over complexity given the 4-day input window.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (inconsistent hourly patterns)",
    "No clear long-term trend",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data histories (≤4 days) favor simple models to avoid overfitting",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit data validation for missing values is critical before modeling",
    "Forecast repetition of averaged patterns maintains consistency for multi-period outputs",
    "Decimal precision matching input data enhances result credibility"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, model selection rationale, and manual computation of hourly averages, but avoids advanced statistical techniques due to data limitations.",
