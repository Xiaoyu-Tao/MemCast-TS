  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data with strong daily seasonality. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, seasonal naive), and selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The solution prioritizes capturing daily cycles while acknowledging limitations like potential anomalies and the absence of clear trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher nighttime values (00:00-08:00)",
    "Lower daytime values (09:00-18:00)",
    "Occasional negative values",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hour-of-day averaging effective",
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model application",
    "Negative values require acceptance without transformation due to task constraints",
    "No consistent trend observed despite daily fluctuations",
    "Forecast repetition across days is optimal without weekly data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with method evaluation and data pattern examination, but simplifies to heuristic implementation (hourly averaging) due to data limitations. Includes detailed pattern analysis and multi-step justification for method selection.",
