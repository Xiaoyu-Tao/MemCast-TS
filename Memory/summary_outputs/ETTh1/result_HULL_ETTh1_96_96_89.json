  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints (96 points), thoroughly examines data completeness, identifies key patterns, and selects a heuristic method after considering but rejecting more complex models like SARIMA. The approach emphasizes adaptability to potential missing values and focuses on capturing the dominant diurnal pattern.",

    "Explicit check for missing values and timestamp continuity in historical data",
    "Identification of daily seasonality (period=24) as the dominant pattern",
    "Rejection of complex models (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) due to limited data and implementation constraints",
    "Use of day averaging with rounding to 3 decimals for forecast generation",
    "Repetition of daily pattern across forecast horizon"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data validation, pattern recognition, and model evaluation before implementing a straightforward heuristic. Includes detailed manual calculations but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations.",
