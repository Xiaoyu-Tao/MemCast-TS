  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying seasonality patterns and selecting a simple averaging method due to insufficient historical data for weekly seasonality modeling. The analysis is methodical but constrained by the 4-day dataset, leading to a heuristic solution that prioritizes robustness over complexity.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts weekly pattern modeling, necessitating heuristic approaches",
    "Averaging per hour across available days provides a simple solution when day-type adjustments are infeasible",
    "Forecasts must account for differing patterns between weekdays and weekends despite data gaps",
    "Rounded hourly averages ensure consistency with input data formatting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition and method evaluation, but simplifies to basic averaging due to data limitations, avoiding advanced statistical techniques.",
