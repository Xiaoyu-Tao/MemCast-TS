  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed, iterative approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) with observed daily seasonality. It begins by considering advanced methods like SARIMA but shifts to heuristic decomposition due to data limitations and simulation constraints. The analysis emphasizes pattern recognition, trend assessment, and practical adaptations for generating 96 forecasted points while addressing potential missing values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Downward trend in daily starting values",
    "Fluctuating daily average levels",
    "Absence of explicit missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Normalization of hourly values using daily averages to separate daily patterns from level changes",
    "Rejection of linear trend projections due to unrealistic negative forecasts",
    "Preference for recent data (last 2 days) over full history for pattern calculation",
    "Use of averaged relative patterns multiplied by projected base levels for forecasting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: involves data inspection, statistical testing (trend/stationarity), method evaluation, iterative refinement, and practical compromises for implementation constraints.",
