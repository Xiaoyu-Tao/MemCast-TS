  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting using limited data (96 hourly points). It initially considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but defaults to a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The analysis focuses heavily on identifying daily seasonality, handles negative values appropriately, and includes detailed data pattern recognition. The approach is systematic but constrained by the small dataset size.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Patterned fluctuations (high nighttime values, morning drops, negative daytime values, evening rises)",
    "No discernible long-term trend",
    "Presence of negative values influencing model selection"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, with consistent hourly behavior across days",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simpler methods over complex models",
    "Negative values require additive rather than multiplicative seasonal approaches",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures recurring patterns when trends are absent",
    "Precision handling through 3-decimal rounding to match input data format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern analysis and statistical considerations, but simplified implementation due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of trends, seasonality, and model suitability before selecting a practical solution.",
