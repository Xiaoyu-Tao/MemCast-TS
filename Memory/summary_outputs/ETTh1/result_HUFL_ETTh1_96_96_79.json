  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96-hour HUFL data using limited historical data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, acknowledges potential missing values (though none are present), and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes practicality by computing hourly averages across available days and repeating the pattern for the forecast horizon, with careful attention to data formatting and rounding.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is leveraged as the primary forecasting basis due to consistent 24-hour cycles",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts the use of complex models like Holt-Winters or weekly seasonality analysis",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across historical days is preferred over weighted or naive methods",
    "Explicit handling of data precision through rounding to 3 decimal places to match input format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition with practical method selection. Includes detailed hourly calculations and considerations for data limitations, but avoids advanced statistical models due to insufficient historical data.",
