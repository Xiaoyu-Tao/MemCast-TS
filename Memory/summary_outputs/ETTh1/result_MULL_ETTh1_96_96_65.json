  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and practicality, opting for a straightforward hourly mean method due to constraints like limited data and inability to run complex models. Key steps include data completeness checks, pattern identification, manual computation of hourly averages, and rounding for precision. The approach is systematic but acknowledges limitations in trend detection and weekly pattern analysis.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour to capture daily seasonality for forecasting",
    "Using multi-day hourly averages as a baseline for future predictions",
    "Rounding computed values to 3 decimal places to maintain data format consistency",
    "Acknowledging data limitations (e.g., 4-day span) prevent trend or weekly pattern analysis",
    "Prioritizing simplicity over complex models when computational execution isn't feasible"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed manual computations; involves step-by-step data grouping, averaging, and rounding, but avoids advanced statistical models due to constraints. Focuses on heuristic pattern extraction over algorithmic sophistication.",
