  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a heuristic-based analysis focused on handling abrupt state changes in time-series data. It identifies a significant pattern shift (negative to positive values) mid-dataset, prioritizes recent post-shift data for forecasting, and constructs a hybrid daily template using direct replication and averaging. The approach emphasizes practical adaptation to data limitations while acknowledging potential weekly pattern constraints.",
