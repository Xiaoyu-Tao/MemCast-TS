  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using limited historical data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and employs simple averaging due to insufficient data for complex modeling. The method focuses on intra-day patterns while acknowledging limitations in capturing weekly seasonality or trends. Data completeness is verified, and computations include handling of negative values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Lower daytime values (00:00-21:00) and nighttime spikes (22:00-23:00)",
    "Occasional negative values in historical data",
    "Stable intra-hour patterns across days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging is preferred for short-term forecasts with limited historical data",
    "Daily seasonality dominates over undetectable weekly patterns with 4 days of data",
    "Negligible overall trend observed, eliminating need for detrending",
    "Explicit handling of negative values in average calculations",
    "Timestamp precision maintained through structured datetime operations"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition with practical heuristics. Includes data grouping, statistical averaging, and datetime handling, but avoids advanced models due to data constraints. Detailed computational steps offset by straightforward methodology.",
