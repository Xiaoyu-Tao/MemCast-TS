  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying patterns and applying a simple averaging technique for forecasting. It emphasizes data completeness checks, clear daily seasonality detection, and step-by-step computation of hourly averages. The approach is practical for short-term forecasts but relies on naive heuristics without advanced statistical models.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Handling of missing values (explicit completeness check)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns are leveraged by averaging corresponding hours across historical days for forecasts",
    "Data validation is prioritized, including checks for missing values and date alignment",
    "Forecasts maintain consistent daily patterns by repeating computed hourly averages",
    "Output formatting precision (rounding to 3 decimals) is rigorously enforced"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with multi-step computations but relies on simple heuristics. Focuses on data preprocessing and pattern-based averaging without statistical modeling or uncertainty quantification.",
