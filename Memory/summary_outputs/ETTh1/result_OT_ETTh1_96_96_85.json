  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed analytical process for time-series forecasting with limited data. It begins by assessing data completeness and seasonality patterns, then evaluates multiple modeling approaches (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, STL) before settling on a heuristic decomposition method. The final approach combines daily mean projections with averaged hourly deviations, prioritizing stability over trend extrapolation due to data limitations.",

    "Heuristic Analysis": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Non-repeating daily patterns",
    "Short-term downward trend in final day",
    "Complete data (no missing values in sample)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is prominent but inconsistent across days, requiring flexible modeling",
    "Short data length (96 points) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Decomposition into daily means and hourly deviations provides robust heuristic for short-term forecasts",
    "Linear trend projections were rejected due to overestimation concerns, favoring stable baselines",
    "Last-day data heavily influences base-level decisions for forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: combines data exploration, model evaluation, statistical decomposition, and heuristic refinement while critically assessing trend reliability.",
