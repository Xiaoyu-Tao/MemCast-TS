  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The model prioritizes handling observed patterns like daily/weekly seasonality and anomalies while balancing complexity. After considering advanced methods (SARIMA, Prophet), it defaults to a simple heuristic averaging technique due to data constraints, focusing on interpretability and pattern replication.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (lower at night, higher daytime)",
    "Weekly pattern (weekdays vs. weekends)",
    "Anomaly detection (constant values on Sunday)",
    "Handling of missing values (not present in sample)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model applicability despite observed seasonality",
    "Weekday/weekend differentiation is critical for pattern accuracy",
    "Averaging same-hour data from comparable days (e.g., weekdays) handles daily patterns effectively",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input precision (3 decimals) ensures consistency",
    "Anomalous periods (e.g., constant Sunday values) should be excluded from base patterns"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial statistical model exploration with practical simplification. Features multi-step analysis (pattern identification, model comparison, heuristic design) but resolves to simple averaging due to data limitations.",
