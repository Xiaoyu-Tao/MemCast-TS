  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96-hour time-series data with limited historical data (4 days). It begins by assessing data completeness and seasonality patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and naive methods), and ultimately selects a simple hourly averaging technique due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes practicality, robustness, and addresses formatting requirements while acknowledging limitations in trend capture.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Irregular peak timing across days",
    "Potential outlier detection",
    "Consistent amplitude in seasonal patterns",
    "No missing values in historical data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, but limited data hinders weekly seasonality capture",
    "Small dataset size (96 points) favors simple methods over complex models",
    "Averaging per hour across days provides robustness against anomalies",
    "Data formatting and rounding precision are critical output requirements",
    "Trade-offs between model sophistication and data limitations must be explicitly addressed"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step statistical considerations (seasonality analysis, model comparisons) but reverts to simple heuristics due to data constraints. Includes detailed implementation planning despite simulated execution.",
