  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting a short time series with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies data limitations (only 96 historical points), recognizes hourly patterns, and selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The solution focuses on computational precision and handles potential data issues like missing values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly value fluctuations without clear long-term trend",
    "Presence of negative and positive values",
    "Handling of potential missing values"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like ARIMA or Holt-Winters",
    "Dominant daily seasonality addressed through hourly averaging across available days",
    "Forecast generation by repeating computed daily patterns for the entire horizon",
    "Precision maintenance through 3-decimal rounding to match input data format"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step data examination, method evaluation, and detailed computations, but simplifies implementation due to data constraints.",
