  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging the inability to capture weekly seasonality or trends. The model emphasizes robustness through explicit handling of potential missing values and data completeness checks.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (low nighttime values, higher daytime values)",
    "Inconsistent daily pattern repetition",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided sample)",
    "Short-term data constraints limiting complex modeling"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as optimal solution for short historical windows (4 days)",
    "Explicit validation of data completeness before processing",
    "Rejection of complex models (ARIMA, ETS, Prophet) due to insufficient data",
    "Pattern-based forecasting through hourly replication across forecast horizon",
    "Consistent rounding to 3 decimals to match input data precision"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning with strong heuristic foundation. Features multi-step validation (data checks, pattern analysis) and method comparison, but ultimately selects simple averaging due to data limitations. Includes detailed computational walkthrough for transparency.",
