  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a moderately complex analytical approach combining statistical methods and heuristic adjustments. The analyst prioritizes handling daily seasonality and emerging trends while working within data limitations (96 hourly points). Methods focus on decomposing patterns, projecting trends, and adjusting for level changes, with explicit consideration of model suitability for short time series.",
