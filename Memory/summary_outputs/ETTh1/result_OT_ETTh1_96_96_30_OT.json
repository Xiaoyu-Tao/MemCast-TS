  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data and anomalies. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality, handling a suspicious constant-value day as an anomaly, and using simple averaging heuristics due to insufficient data for complex modeling. The method prioritizes data availability and pattern consistency over sophisticated algorithms.",
