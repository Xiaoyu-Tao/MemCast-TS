  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process identifies strong daily seasonality (24-hour patterns) and employs a practical hybrid approach. While initially considering SARIMA modeling for its seasonal capabilities, the analysis ultimately adopts a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days) and weekday pattern consistency requirements. The solution demonstrates awareness of statistical methods but prioritizes practicality given data constraints, explicitly handling anomalies through averaging without adjustment.",
