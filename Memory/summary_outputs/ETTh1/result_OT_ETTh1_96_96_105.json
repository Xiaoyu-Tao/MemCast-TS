  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analysis of hourly oil temperature data, focusing on daily seasonality and data limitations. It evaluates advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately adopts a heuristic approach due to the small dataset size (96 points). The method involves calculating an average daily pattern, adjusting it using recent data levels, and projecting it forward. The reasoning is highly detailed, incorporating trend analysis, anomaly detection, and practical adjustments for forecasting.",
