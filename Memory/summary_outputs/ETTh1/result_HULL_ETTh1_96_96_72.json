  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to handling short-term hourly time-series forecasting with limited historical data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and outliers, evaluates multiple advanced models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a robust median-based method due to data constraints. The approach emphasizes outlier resilience and simplicity while maintaining structured data validation.",
