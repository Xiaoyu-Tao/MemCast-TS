  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple heuristics due to computational constraints. The analyst identifies daily seasonality patterns, verifies data completeness, and employs a straightforward averaging method to generate forecasts. The approach is systematic but relies on naive pattern repetition without accounting for trends or external factors.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent dip during daytime hours",
    "Recovery during nighttime hours",
    "No significant long-term trend observed",
    "Complete historical records (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging of corresponding time points across historical days as forecasting mechanism",
    "Explicit pattern recognition of daytime dips and nighttime recoveries in energy load",
    "Decision against trend adjustment due to lack of clear directional movement",
    "Consistent rounding of forecasts to 3 decimal places to match input data precision",
    "Repetition of identical daily patterns across forecast horizon"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Mostly simple heuristics with basic arithmetic operations; considers but dismisses advanced models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) due to stated constraints. Focuses on pattern replication rather than statistical modeling or error analysis.",
