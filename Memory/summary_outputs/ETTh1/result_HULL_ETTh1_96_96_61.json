  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a simple yet practical approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints. It starts by analyzing data characteristics (hourly frequency, 4 days of history) and considers advanced models like SARIMA and ETS before rejecting them due to limited data. The final solution uses hourly averaging to capture daily seasonality, with detailed implementation steps for calculating and rounding forecast values. The approach prioritizes interpretability and feasibility over complexity given the small dataset.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Day-to-day value variations",
    "No missing values in provided segment",
    "Mixed weekday/weekend patterns"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (96 points) constrains model selection to simple methods",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short horizons",
    "Explicit handling of rounding precision to match input data format",
    "Insufficient data for weekly seasonality modeling despite date context",
    "Rejection of complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to sample size limitations"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough consideration of model alternatives and detailed implementation logic, though ultimately employing simple averaging due to data constraints.",
