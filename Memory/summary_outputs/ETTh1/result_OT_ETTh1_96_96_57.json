  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, starting with consideration of advanced statistical models like SARIMA but ultimately adopting a weighted averaging heuristic due to limited data (96 points) and computational restrictions. The analysis thoroughly examines data patterns, acknowledges challenges like potential missing values and short history, and prioritizes recent observations through weighted averaging. While method is simplified, it systematically addresses seasonality and data characteristics.",
