  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It identifies daily seasonality, evaluates multiple models, and addresses potential anomalies while acknowledging data constraints. The analysis is thorough but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to the short dataset, balancing complexity with practicality.",

    "Prioritized simplicity due to limited data (only 4 days available)",
    "Used hourly averaging to capture daily seasonality while smoothing anomalies",
    "Considered but rejected complex models (e.g., Holt-Winters, ARIMA) due to data constraints",
