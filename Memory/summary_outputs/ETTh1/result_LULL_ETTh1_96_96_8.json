  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data sequences with clear daily seasonality. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods before selecting a simple averaging technique due to data constraints, emphasizing robustness to missing values and practical implementation. The approach prioritizes capturing daily patterns while acknowledging limitations in trend detection from limited historical data.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (values drop at night, rise during day)",
    "Hourly frequency consistency",
    "Variation across days for same hours",
    "Potential slight downward trend (inconclusive due to short data)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for small datasets (4 days) over complex models like SARIMA to avoid over-parameterization",
    "Using hourly averaging to capture daily seasonality when full-cycle data is limited",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Repeating the identified daily pattern for the entire forecast horizon",
    "Validating date continuity and alignment when generating future timestamps"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Starts with advanced method evaluation but simplifies to heuristic averaging. Includes detailed numerical validation and timestamp handling, though trend analysis remains limited by data length.",
