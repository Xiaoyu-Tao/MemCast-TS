  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical, iterative approach to time-series forecasting that starts with complex model considerations (SARIMA) but shifts to simpler heuristic methods due to data constraints. The analyst prioritizes handling potential missing values, identifies key patterns like daily seasonality and trends, and combines statistical techniques with averaging for robustness. The process is thorough but occasionally inconsistent in final method selection.",
