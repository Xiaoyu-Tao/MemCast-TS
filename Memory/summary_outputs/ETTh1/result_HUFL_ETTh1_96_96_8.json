  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to the short data span, opting for a heuristic method over complex statistical models after evaluating seasonality patterns and data constraints. Key steps include data completeness checks, method selection rationale, pattern analysis, and detailed computation with output formatting considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Downward trend across days",
    "Inconsistent daily patterns",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simplified methods over complex models like SARIMA/ETS",
    "Hourly averaging captures daily seasonality when historical patterns are inconsistent",
    "Repeating averaged daily patterns for multi-day forecasts when weekly seasonality can't be determined",
    "Explicit handling of output formatting (datetime alignment and decimal precision)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method evaluation, and computational execution, but simplifies to heuristic approaches due to data limitations. Includes detailed pattern analysis and practical implementation steps.",
