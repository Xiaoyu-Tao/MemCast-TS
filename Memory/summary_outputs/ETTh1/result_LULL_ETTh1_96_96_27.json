  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting a 96-hour time series with limited historical points. It identifies strong daily seasonality and handles an abrupt pattern shift by excluding an inconsistent first day. The solution relies on simple averaging of recent seasonal patterns due to data constraints, with detailed hourly calculations and rounding for precision. While acknowledging limitations, it provides a practical short-term forecast.",
