  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on handling anomalies and leveraging daily seasonality. The analyst identifies data constraints (only 4 days of history with one anomalous day), explores multiple methods, and settles on a simple averaging technique due to insufficient data for complex models. The solution prioritizes robustness over sophistication, generating forecasts by repeating an averaged daily pattern.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (≤4 days) restricts complex model usage and weekly seasonality capture",
    "Anomalous data points should be excluded from pattern calculations",
    "Averaging non-anomalous same-hour values provides stability with sparse data",
    "Trade-off between model complexity and data availability drives method selection",
    "Repeating averaged daily patterns is viable for short-term forecasts when historical patterns are inconsistent"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves data diagnostics (anomaly detection, seasonality assessment), method comparison (seasonal naive vs. averaging), and practical trade-off decisions, but ultimately implements a straightforward solution due to data limitations.",
