  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on simple, interpretable methods suitable for short time-series data. It prioritizes daily seasonality detection and handles data constraints effectively, though it explicitly avoids complex models due to limited historical data. The step-by-step logic shows careful data inspection and methodical computation but relies heavily on heuristic averaging.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data inspection and step-by-step computations, but relies on simple heuristics rather than advanced statistical models. Includes manual calculations for hourly averages and thorough justification of method selection.",
