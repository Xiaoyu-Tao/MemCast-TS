  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short-term hourly data with daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by using a basic averaging method due to limited historical records (only 4 days), while acknowledging data completeness and potential missing value concerns. The approach systematically addresses timestamp alignment and output formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable short-term patterns without clear long-term trend",

  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging values captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) justifies simple methods over complex models",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity for forecast period alignment",
    "Precision matching through rounding forecasts to 3 decimal places",
    "Acknowledgment of potential missing values despite current data completeness"

  "complexity_analysis": "Low to moderate complexity: Uses straightforward heuristics (hourly averaging) with clear data handling steps. Avoids advanced statistical models due to data limitations, focusing instead on practical implementation details like timestamp generation and rounding.",
