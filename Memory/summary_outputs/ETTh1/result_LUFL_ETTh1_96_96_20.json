  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed analytical approach focused on pattern recognition and practical heuristics due to data limitations. It carefully examines seasonality, identifies distinct daily patterns, and develops a forecasting strategy based on observed odd/even day variations. The solution prioritizes interpretability and simplicity given the small dataset.",
