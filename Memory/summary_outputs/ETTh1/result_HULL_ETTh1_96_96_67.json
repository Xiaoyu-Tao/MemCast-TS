  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling short-term hourly data with daily seasonality but limited historical data (4 days). The analyst evaluated multiple methods (SARIMA, ETS, STL) but ultimately selected a simple hourly averaging approach due to data constraints. Key considerations included handling potential missing values, daily pattern extraction, and maintaining 3-decimal precision while acknowledging limitations in trend detection and weekly seasonality analysis.",

    "Explicit handling of 3-decimal precision matching source data",
    "Weekly seasonality dismissed due to insufficient temporal coverage",
    "Negative value accommodation in averaging calculations"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-stage evaluation: Compared advanced statistical models before selecting a simple heuristic method. Included detailed data inspection, pattern validation across multiple days, and systematic implementation of hourly averaging with precision considerations.",
