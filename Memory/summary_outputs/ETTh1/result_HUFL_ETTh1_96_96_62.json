  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on daily seasonality patterns and data limitations. The analyst prioritized simplicity by using hourly averaging across 4 historical days, acknowledging potential weekend effect limitations but proceeding due to insufficient data. While considering advanced methods like SARIMA, the final implementation used straightforward hourly averages as a robust baseline given the short 96-hour history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent hourly load patterns across days",

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as baseline for seasonal patterns",
    "Explicit handling of potential weekend effects through data limitation acknowledgment",
    "Preference for simplicity over complex models given limited data",
    "Detailed hourly pattern analysis showing daytime troughs and evening peaks",
    "Conscious rounding to match original data precision"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough pattern examination and method comparison, but ultimately implemented a simple solution. Included considerations of alternative approaches (SARIMA, seasonal naive) before selecting the averaging method, demonstrating layered analytical thinking within data constraints.",
