  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying daily seasonality and handling data constraints. It prioritizes simplicity due to limited 4-day dataset, opting for hourly averaging over complex models after evaluating alternatives like SARIMA and Holt-Winters. The analysis includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and practical implementation details like rounding precision.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Negative value handling",
    "No missing values in input data",
    "Consistent daily pattern repetition"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, with values peaking at night and dipping sharply around noon",
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents weekly seasonality modeling despite observed weekday variations",
    "Hourly averaging across available days provides a practical forecast baseline",
    "Rounding precision must match input data specifications (3 decimal places)",
    "Negative values necessitate additive rather than multiplicative models"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, model selection rationale, and detailed implementation steps while maintaining simplicity due to data limitations.",
