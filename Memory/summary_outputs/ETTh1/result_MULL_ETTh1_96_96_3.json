  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a limited 4-day hourly dataset. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, opting for a heuristic method over complex models. Key considerations include handling potential missing values, identifying weak daily patterns, and addressing the choice of method given the short history. The approach is pragmatic but acknowledges limitations in capturing trends with minimal data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Weak daily seasonality (diurnal patterns)",

    "Hourly averaging as a fallback for short time-series data",
    "Explicit handling of data constraints (no code execution)",
    "Rounding conventions matching input precision (3 decimals)",

    "Trade-off between model complexity and data limitations"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning with statistical considerations: Starts with advanced model evaluations (ARIMA/Prophet) but defaults to simple heuristics due to data constraints. Includes data inspection, pattern analysis, and step-by-step computational validation.",
