  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach focused on identifying patterns and applying simple, practical forecasting techniques. It emphasizes handling seasonality through averaging methods while acknowledging limitations like potential trends and missing data constraints. The solution prioritizes computational feasibility and output formatting.",
