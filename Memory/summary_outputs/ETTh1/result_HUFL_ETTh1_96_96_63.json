  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a time-series forecasting approach for a short dataset (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality but notes insufficient data for complex models. The chosen method is a simple average of each hour across available days, repeated for the forecast horizon. The approach includes data grouping, mean calculation, and precision handling, prioritizing simplicity due to data limitations.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal variation)",
    "Presence of negative values and fluctuations",
    "Complete data (no missing values in provided series)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex modeling (e.g., SARIMA) due to insufficient seasonal cycles",
    "Daily patterns (24-hour cycles) dominate the time-series structure",
    "Inability to model weekly seasonality from limited weekday/weekend samples",
    "Data rounding to match original precision (3 decimals) is explicitly addressed"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines statistical awareness (seasonality detection) with practical simplification. Includes multi-step data processing but avoids advanced modeling due to data constraints.",
