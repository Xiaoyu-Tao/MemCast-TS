  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It identifies daily seasonality and day-of-week variations but faces challenges due to insufficient historical data for complex modeling. The solution prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging across available days, repeated for the forecast horizon, while acknowledging limitations in handling weekly patterns and potential anomalies.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Day-of-week variation (weekdays vs. weekends)",
    "Handling of missing values (considered but not present in data)",
    "Hourly pattern consistency (e.g., lower at night, higher daytime)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex models like SARIMA/ETS despite identified seasonality",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days provides a practical baseline",
    "Day-of-week patterns are recognized but not utilized due to lack of matching historical days",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals ensures output consistency with input format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step reasoning exploring advanced methods before simplifying due to data constraints. Includes data inspection, pattern recognition, and practical trade-off decisions.",
