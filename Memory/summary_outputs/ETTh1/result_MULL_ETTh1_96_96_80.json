  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging method due to limited historical data. The analyst systematically addresses data completeness, seasonality patterns, and practical constraints, resulting in a pragmatic solution that prioritizes feasibility over complex modeling given the 4-day dataset. The approach is logical but constrained by insufficient data for capturing weekly seasonality.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Handling of missing values (checked but not found)",
    "Negative value tolerance",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is prioritized over weekly patterns due to limited historical data (only 4 days)",
    "Same-hour averaging across available days as the optimal simple method for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit rounding of forecasts to 3 decimal places to match input data precision",
    "Date-time alignment for forecasting identical hourly patterns across future days"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with practical constraints: Focuses on heuristic methods (hourly averaging) rather than advanced statistical models, with thorough data validation and implementation logic. Complexity is limited by the small dataset size and absence of missing values.",
