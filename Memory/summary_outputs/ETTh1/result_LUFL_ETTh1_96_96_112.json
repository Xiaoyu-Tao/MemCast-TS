  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality identification. It evaluates multiple methods but settles on simple averaging due to limited historical data (only 4 days), acknowledging trade-offs between complexity and feasibility while ensuring robustness for potential missing values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Variation by day of week (weekdays vs. weekends)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Characteristic load patterns (night lows, morning/evening peaks)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary identifiable pattern given limited data",
    "Insufficient historical data prevents modeling weekly seasonality or trends",
    "Hourly averaging provides a robust solution when same-day-of-week data is unavailable",
    "Method prioritizes simplicity and missing-value robustness over complexity",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week mismatches between historical and forecast periods"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Evaluates advanced methods (e.g., ETS, ARIMA) but intentionally simplifies to averaging due to data limitations, with detailed hourly-level computations and day-of-week considerations.",
