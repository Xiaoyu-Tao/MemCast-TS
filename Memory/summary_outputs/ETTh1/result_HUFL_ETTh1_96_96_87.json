  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for heuristic methods over complex models due to computational constraints. Key strengths include thorough pattern recognition and step-by-step arithmetic validation, though the approach shows limited sophistication in trend handling and anomaly adjustment.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Recurring anomalies (notably negative spikes at noon)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Hourly pattern variation across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Seasonality is addressed through hourly averaging across multiple days",
    "Forecasts rely exclusively on historical patterns without trend projection",
    "Anomalies are acknowledged but not explicitly modeled or adjusted",
    "Data precision is maintained through 3-decimal rounding",
    "Repeating averaged daily patterns simplifies multi-day forecasting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed arithmetic validation and pattern analysis, but limited to heuristic methods without advanced statistical modeling or machine learning techniques.",
