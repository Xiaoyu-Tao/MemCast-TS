  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of a short time-series dataset with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple forecasting methods (including SARIMA, exponential smoothing, and heuristic approaches), and ultimately selects a seasonal naive method due to data limitations. The reasoning is thorough, considering data irregularities, level variations, and practical constraints while justifying the chosen approach.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Varying daily averages",
    "Irregularities (e.g., sudden value drops)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Hourly pattern consistency"

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (96 points) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Seasonal patterns show significant day-to-day level variations despite consistent hourly shapes",
    "Most recent data window provides the best reference for near-term forecasting",
    "Daily averages fluctuate without a discernible trend (1.844, 2.405, 1.996, 2.272)",
