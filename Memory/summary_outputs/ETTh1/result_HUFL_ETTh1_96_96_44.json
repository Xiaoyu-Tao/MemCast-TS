  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on handling short historical data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited data points (96 hours), opting for a straightforward averaging method over complex models. Key considerations include identifying patterns, addressing potential missing values, and ensuring output completeness, though the approach is constrained by the 4-day history.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily pattern extraction due to 24-hour seasonality",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (e.g., ETS, ARIMA) due to limited data stability concerns",
    "Hourly averaging as a robust method for short-term forecasting with repeating cycles",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications. While demonstrating awareness of advanced techniques, the reasoning defaults to heuristic averaging due to data limitations, featuring detailed pattern analysis but avoiding statistical modeling.",
