  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using available data patterns. It focuses on handling hourly data with daily seasonality and anomalies, employing a simple yet robust median-based heuristic due to computational constraints. The analysis emphasizes data completeness, pattern stability checks, and pragmatic forecasting under limitations, resulting in a complete 96-hour forecast.",
