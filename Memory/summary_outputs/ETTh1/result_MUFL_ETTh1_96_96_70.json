  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a systematic approach to handling short-term hourly time-series forecasting with daily seasonality. Analysts prioritized identifying patterns, considered multiple statistical methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately implemented a heuristic approach using two-day hourly averages due to data limitations (4 days of history). The solution emphasizes practical adaptation to constraints like dataset brevity and potential missing values while maintaining focus on daily patterns.",
