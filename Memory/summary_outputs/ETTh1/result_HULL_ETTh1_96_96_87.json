  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short historical data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness over complex modeling due to the limited 4-day dataset, ultimately selecting a straightforward hourly averaging method after considering but dismissing more advanced techniques like ETS or ARIMA. The process emphasizes data observation, pattern recognition, and pragmatic trade-offs between model complexity and data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Peak values during daytime hours",
    "Low values during nighttime hours",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts the use of complex models or weekly pattern detection",
    "Hourly averaging provides a robust baseline for seasonal data when historical depth is insufficient for advanced models",
    "Data rounding and formatting consistency is critical for output alignment with original data specifications",
    "Explicit handling of potential missing values is considered but not implemented due to complete historical data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with emphasis on heuristic approaches. The reasoning involves initial consideration of advanced models but defaults to basic arithmetic operations and pattern repetition due to data constraints, avoiding statistical parameter estimation or decomposition techniques.",
