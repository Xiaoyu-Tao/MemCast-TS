  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly LUFL data with limited historical data (4 days). The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, evaluates multiple modeling approaches (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a simple hourly averaging method due to data constraints. The solution includes thorough consideration of data characteristics, missing value handling, and datetime alignment, though the approach prioritizes practicality over complex modeling given the short data horizon.",

    "Limited history (4 days) prevents weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Hourly averaging serves as a practical baseline for short-term forecasts",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of statistical models and data patterns, but reverts to simple heuristics due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, trend analysis, and datetime handling.",
