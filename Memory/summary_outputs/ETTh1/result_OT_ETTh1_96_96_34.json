  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst initially considers advanced methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but opts for a simple averaging heuristic due to insufficient data for robust seasonal modeling. The approach focuses on identifying daily patterns from recent data, computing an hourly profile from the last two days, and projecting it forward. The reasoning is logical but constrained by data limitations, with explicit handling of decimal precision and datetime formatting.",

    "Prioritizing recent data (last 2 days) for pattern extraction due to higher relevance",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Starts with advanced method considerations but reverts to heuristic averaging due to data constraints. Includes pattern decomposition, trend observation, and data formatting, but avoids statistical modeling.",
