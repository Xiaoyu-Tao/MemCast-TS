  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identified daily seasonality but faced challenges in modeling weekly patterns or trends due to the 4-day window. After evaluating SARIMA and exponential smoothing, the solution adopted a simple averaging method using same-hour historical averages due to computational constraints and data limitations. The approach emphasizes pattern repetition while acknowledging potential shortcomings in trend handling.",
