  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on daily seasonality and simple averaging due to limited historical data (4 days). It prioritizes handling visible patterns over complex modeling, acknowledging data constraints while ensuring completeness in forecasts. The method emphasizes pattern recognition and baseline heuristics rather than advanced statistical techniques.",
