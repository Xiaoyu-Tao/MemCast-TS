  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly LUFL data with limited historical points. It begins by assessing data characteristics (no missing values, daily seasonality) and evaluates multiple modeling options before selecting a robust heuristic method. The approach prioritizes outlier resistance and simplicity given the short data history, leading to a median-based seasonal naive forecast implementation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of outliers (notably in 2017-05-08 data)",
    "No missing values in historical data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (96 points) necessitates simple, robust methods to avoid overfitting",
    "Median-based aggregation provides resilience against outliers compared to mean",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for multi-day forecasting",
    "Data rounding (3 decimals) to maintain input format consistency"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of statistical methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) before implementing a carefully justified heuristic solution. Includes detailed data pattern analysis and step-by-step computational validation.",
