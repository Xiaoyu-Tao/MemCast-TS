  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints, focusing on simple methods due to the limited historical data (only 4 days). The analysis identifies daily seasonality as the primary pattern and uses averaging to create a typical daily profile, balancing simplicity with consideration of day-of-week variations. The approach emphasizes data completeness and format consistency in the output.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Day-of-week variations (e.g., higher values on weekends)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity when historical data is limited (4 days)",
    "Using hourly averaging to smooth day-to-day variations and create a typical daily profile",
    "Considering day-of-week context (e.g., Sunday vs. Monday patterns) despite data",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Generating complete datetime sequences for output consistency"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical adaptations: Combines data pattern analysis, method comparison (seasonal naive vs. averaging), and detailed hourly calculations, but avoids advanced models due to data limitations.",
