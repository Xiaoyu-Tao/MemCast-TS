  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a limited 4-day dataset. It carefully analyzes data characteristics, considers multiple methods, and selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The approach is thorough, addressing seasonality, variability, and data formatting while justifying method selection based on data limitations.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "High variability at same hours across days",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Potential missing values (though none found in sample)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity due to limited historical data (only 4 days)",
    "Using hourly averages across days to smooth variability and capture daily patterns",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Rejecting complex models (e.g., ARIMA) as unfeasible with minimal data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data examination, method comparison, and detailed computations while maintaining practical simplicity due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of patterns and rounding logic.",
