  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on practical time-series forecasting using limited data window (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simple methods due to data constraints, primarily using hourly averaging to capture potential daily patterns while acknowledging limitations of small dataset size and possible missing values. The approach demonstrates methodical data validation and pattern recognition but shows limited complexity due to minimal historical data.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate initial complexity with statistical model consideration (ARIMA/SARIMA), ultimately simplifying to heuristic averaging method due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of data patterns and method suitability, but final implementation remains computationally simple.",
