  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical heuristic approach combining seasonal pattern recognition and anomaly handling. It focuses on daily seasonality detection, distinguishes between regular days and potential holiday patterns, and uses simple averaging for typical days while applying a seasonal naive method for suspected holiday periods. The approach demonstrates moderate complexity with clear handling of data ambiguities while constrained by limited historical data.",
