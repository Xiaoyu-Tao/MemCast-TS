  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling a short time-series (96 hourly points) to forecast 96 future values. The analyst prioritized daily seasonality detection, considered but dismissed complex models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) due to data limitations, and ultimately implemented a simple averaging method using hourly patterns from historical data. The approach emphasizes practicality over statistical sophistication given the constraints.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized daily seasonality over weekly patterns due to limited 4-day window",
    "Used hourly averaging as compromise between pattern capture and data limitations",
    "Considered but rejected complex models due to small training set size",
    "Implemented strict rounding to maintain input format consistency"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with initial multi-model consideration, progressing to simple heuristics. Combined statistical concepts (seasonality detection, stationarity checks) with practical implementation constraints, demonstrating adaptive reasoning from complex to simple solutions.",
