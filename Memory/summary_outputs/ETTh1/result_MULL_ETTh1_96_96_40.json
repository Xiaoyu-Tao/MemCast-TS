  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling short historical data (4 days) with daily seasonality and potential missing values. After evaluating SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and trend-based methods, the analysis concluded with a simple averaging approach using hourly means across days to capture daily patterns while acknowledging data limitations and possible trend impacts.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Hourly averaging compensates for limited data while capturing daily patterns",
