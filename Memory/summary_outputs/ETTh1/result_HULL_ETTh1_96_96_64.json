  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting 96-hour transformer load data using limited historical data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, acknowledges data constraints (only 4 days of history), and selects a simple averaging method due to the inability to capture weekly patterns or complex trends. The approach includes data inspection, pattern recognition, hourly mean calculations, and output formatting with rounding.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling, favoring simple averaging",
    "Explicit handling of daily patterns through hourly mean aggregation",
    "Rounding outputs to 3 decimals to match input data precision",
    "Rejection of advanced models (SARIMA/ETS) due to insufficient training data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method justification, and detailed computations, but relies on simple heuristics due to data limitations.",
