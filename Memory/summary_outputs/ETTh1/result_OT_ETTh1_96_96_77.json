  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to handle short-term forecasting with limited data (4 days). It prioritizes capturing daily seasonality by averaging each hour across available days, dismissing more complex models like SARIMA due to data constraints. The approach is pragmatic, focusing on robustness and simplicity while acknowledging potential trends and data limitations.",
