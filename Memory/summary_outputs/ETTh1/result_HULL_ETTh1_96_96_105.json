  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting for hourly transformer load data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for missing values and trends, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach is pragmatic but basic, focusing on pattern repetition without advanced modeling given limited historical data.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Pattern repetition across days",
    "Higher variability in daytime values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days captures daily patterns effectively",
    "Insufficient data prevents modeling weekly seasonality or trends",
    "Forecasts rely on repeating averaged hourly patterns for future periods",
    "Rounding forecasted averages to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Handling missing values is considered but not required in this case"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with clear logical steps but limited to basic heuristics. Focuses on data observation and simple averaging rather than statistical or machine learning models due to data constraints.",
