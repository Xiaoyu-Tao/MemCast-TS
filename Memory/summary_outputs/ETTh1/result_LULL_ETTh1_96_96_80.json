  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited historical data. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by leveraging clear daily seasonality patterns, opting for a straightforward averaging method over more complex models due to data constraints. The analysis systematically evaluates data characteristics, considers alternative methods, and implements a transparent calculation process with attention to output formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Consistent hourly fluctuations (low nighttime values, high daytime values)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity (hourly averaging) over complex models (SARIMA) when historical data is limited",
    "Handling short data spans by grouping observations into hourly buckets across days",
    "Repeating identified daily patterns for multi-day forecasts",
    "Rounding outputs to match original data precision (3 decimal places)",
