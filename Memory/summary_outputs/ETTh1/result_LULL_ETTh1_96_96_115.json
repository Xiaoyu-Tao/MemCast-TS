  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple heuristics for a small dataset with clear daily seasonality. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in limited data (96 hourly points) and selects a straightforward averaging method to generate forecasts, prioritizing stability and simplicity while acknowledging data constraints.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Inconsistent evening/night positive spikes",
    "Daytime negative values with evening transitions",
    "Limited dataset constraints (4 days)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns dominate forecasting decisions due to clear 24-hour cycles",
    "Small datasets necessitate simple methods like averaging or naive repetition",
    "Hourly averaging smooths day-to-day variations for stable forecasts",
    "Data limitations prevent accounting for weekly seasonality or trends"
