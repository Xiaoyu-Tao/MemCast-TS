  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data. The analyst prioritizes handling potential missing values, identifies clear daily seasonality patterns, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach is pragmatic, focusing on capturing hourly patterns while acknowledging limitations for more complex models.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Hourly variation across days",
    "Consistent data sampling (hourly intervals)",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex model application",
    "Daily patterns can be captured by averaging same-hour values across previous days",
    "Explicit handling of missing value expectations despite absence in historical data",
    "Data rounding for consistency with original precision (3 decimals)",
    "Rejection of complex models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) due to insufficient data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Detailed data validation and method justification, but ultimately employs simple averaging due to limited historical data. Includes multi-step pattern analysis and explicit trade-off evaluations between model sophistication and data limitations.",
