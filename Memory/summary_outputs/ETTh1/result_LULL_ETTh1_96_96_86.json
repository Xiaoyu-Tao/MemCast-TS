  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a straightforward seasonal naive approach to forecast 96-hour LULL values by repeating the last observed 24-hour pattern. The analysis correctly identifies daily seasonality and handles missing value considerations despite their absence in input data. The method prioritizes simplicity under computational constraints while maintaining logical consistency with observed patterns.",
