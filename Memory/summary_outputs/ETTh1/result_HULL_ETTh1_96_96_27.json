  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting 96 hourly data points using simple averaging due to data limitations. The analyst considers advanced models like SARIMA and LSTM but discards them given the small dataset (96 points). Instead, they identify a weak daily seasonality pattern and implement an hourly averaging method, projecting the pattern forward for 4 days. The approach includes data completeness checks, pattern analysis, and output formatting considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No significant trend over 4 days",
    "Complete input data (no missing values in provided points)",
    "Negative value occurrences"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (96 points) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA/LSTM",
    "Hourly averaging as a baseline for short-term forecasting with suspected daily patterns",
    "Robustness considerations for potential missing values despite complete input data",
    "Precision matching (rounding to 3 decimals) to align with input format"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with initial consideration of advanced models, but simplified to heuristic averaging due to data constraints. Includes data decomposition concepts and systematic output generation.",
