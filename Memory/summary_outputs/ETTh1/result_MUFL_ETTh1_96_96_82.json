  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a daily seasonality-focused approach using simple averaging of hourly patterns from historical data. It demonstrates systematic pattern recognition and cautious trend assessment while maintaining practicality for multi-step forecasting. The method prioritizes observable daily cycles over potential weekly patterns due to limited data scope.",
