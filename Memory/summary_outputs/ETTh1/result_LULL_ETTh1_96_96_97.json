  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a straightforward heuristic approach for handling constant-value time-series data. The model identifies the historical data as entirely zeros, infers no trend or seasonality due to lack of variation, and concludes that the most reasonable forecast is a continuation of zeros. The reasoning prioritizes simplicity and data consistency while adhering strictly to output formatting requirements.",
