  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited data, identifying daily seasonality but opting for a simple averaging method due to the short history of only 4 days. The analysis is systematic, considering model limitations and data characteristics, but relies on heuristic averaging rather than advanced statistical models.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Presence of negative values",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Hourly fluctuations with peak/off-peak variations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model application (e.g., SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing)",
    "Hourly averaging as a fallback for capturing daily patterns with minimal data",
    "Repetition of averaged daily pattern for multi-day forecasts",
    "Data rounding to match original precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Timestamp generation aligned with hourly frequency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Detailed pattern recognition and step-by-step averaging logic, but avoids advanced modeling due to data constraints. Focuses on pragmatic solutions over theoretical optimization.",
