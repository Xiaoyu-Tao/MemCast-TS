  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to multi-step time-series forecasting using limited historical data. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging data limitations and potential anomalies. The method prioritizes simplicity due to computational constraints, opting for a straightforward averaging technique after evaluating alternatives like seasonal naive forecasting. The analysis includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and careful handling of precision requirements.",
