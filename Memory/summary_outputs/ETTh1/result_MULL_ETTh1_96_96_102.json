  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step approach to forecasting 96 hours of transformer load data using only 4 days of historical data. The analyst identifies data limitations, explores seasonality and trend patterns, rejects complex models like SARIMA due to insufficient data, and implements a decomposition method combining linear regression for daily means with averaged hourly deviations. The approach is methodical and adaptive, addressing data constraints while maintaining statistical rigor.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simpler models over complex ones like SARIMA",
    "Decomposition into daily means and hourly deviations effectively handles seasonality in short series",
    "Linear regression on daily means captures emerging trends for short-term forecasts",
    "Averaging hourly deviations provides stable seasonal components despite pattern inconsistencies",
    "Data constraints require careful trade-offs between model complexity and reliability"
