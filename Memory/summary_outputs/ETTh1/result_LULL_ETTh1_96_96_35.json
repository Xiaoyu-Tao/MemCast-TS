  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting using limited historical data. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality patterns and employs a simple averaging method due to data constraints, emphasizing robustness over complexity. The forecaster prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while acknowledging limitations like insufficient data for weekly pattern detection.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over trend analysis given short data history",
    "Use of hourly averaging as a baseline method when complex models are infeasible",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week limitations (insufficient data for weekly patterns)",
