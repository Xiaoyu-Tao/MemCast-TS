  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed, multi-step analytical approach for short time-series forecasting. It emphasizes identifying data patterns, handling limited history (only 4 days), and adapting methods when initial assumptions fail. The analyst prioritizes practicality, shifting from complex models (e.g., ARIMA, decomposition) to heuristic adjustments after observing data inconsistencies, ultimately settling on custom decomposition with averaging for feasibility.",

    "Short histories require simplified models despite seasonality",
    "Initial data exploration is critical to detect outliers (e.g., anomalous first day)",
    "Trend projection must be validated to avoid unrealistic forecasts",
