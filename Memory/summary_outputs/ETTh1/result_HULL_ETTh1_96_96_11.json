  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, identifying daily seasonality but acknowledging insufficient length for robust model fitting. Key steps include handling potential missing values, evaluating trend/seasonality, and selecting an averaging method over complex models like ARIMA or exponential smoothing given the 4-day dataset.",
