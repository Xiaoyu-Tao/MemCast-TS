  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analysis of a 96-hour time-series dataset for Middle Useful Load (MUFL) forecasting. It begins with data inspection, identifies daily seasonality and non-linear trends, and evaluates multiple modeling approaches before settling on a heuristic decomposition method. The analysis is highly detailed, featuring manual computations for daily averages, seasonal indices, and trend projections, while acknowledging limitations from the small dataset size (4 days).",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Heuristic Analysis": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Non-linear trend in daily averages",
    "Fluctuations with negative values",
    "Absence of missing values in the provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, requiring decomposition into hourly indices",
    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Decomposition into daily level + seasonal component is effective for short-term forecasting",
    "Linear trend projection based on daily averages outperforms simple averaging",
    "Hand-calculation of seasonal indices via daily mean subtraction is necessary without code execution"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis, including data decomposition, trend modeling, and iterative heuristic refinement.",
