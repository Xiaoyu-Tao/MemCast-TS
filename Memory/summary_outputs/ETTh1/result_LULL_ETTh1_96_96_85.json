  "overall_summary": "The forecasting approach prioritized simplicity and practicality given computational constraints, focusing on recent stable patterns after a notable regime shift. The analyst identified daily seasonality and negative value persistence post-anomaly, ultimately using averaged hourly values from the last two stable days repeated cyclically for the 4-day forecast period.",
