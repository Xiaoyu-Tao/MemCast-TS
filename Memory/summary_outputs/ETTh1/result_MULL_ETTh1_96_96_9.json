  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-term hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical data (only 4 days), opting for a pattern-based averaging method after evaluating and dismissing more complex models like SARIMA. Key considerations include handling potential missing values, assessing data stability, and accounting for time-based patterns while acknowledging limitations in capturing weekly seasonality.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
