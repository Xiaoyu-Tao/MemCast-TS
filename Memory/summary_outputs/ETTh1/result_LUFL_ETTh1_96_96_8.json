  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a straightforward heuristic approach focused on daily seasonality, using simple averaging of historical same-hour values to forecast future periods. The method prioritizes pattern repetition over complex modeling due to limited data (only 4 days), resulting in a practical but basic solution that ignores potential trends or external factors.",
