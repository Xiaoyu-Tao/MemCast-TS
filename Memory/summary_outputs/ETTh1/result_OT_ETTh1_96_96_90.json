  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It begins by exploring advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, handling potential data issues, and implementing a feasible solution for multi-step forecasting.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Temperature fluctuations (lower at night, higher during day)",
    "Handling of missing values (not present in this dataset)",
    "Outlier detection (e.g., spike on 2017-06-27)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) constrains model selection, favoring simpler methods over complex statistical models",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hour-of-day averaging effective",
    "Data granularity and precision require careful handling (6 decimal digits maintained)",
    "Anomalies like spikes are smoothed through averaging, potentially limiting sensitivity to extreme events"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Combines statistical consideration (seasonality/trend analysis) with practical heuristics, but simplifies implementation due to limited data volume.",
