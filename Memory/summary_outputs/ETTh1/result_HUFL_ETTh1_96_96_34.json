  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to multi-step time-series forecasting using limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness by leveraging observed daily seasonality while explicitly addressing potential data limitations like missing values. The approach combines data inspection, pattern identification, and comparative method evaluation before selecting a practical solution suitable for the data constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable hourly patterns without clear long-term trend",
    "Higher values during night/early morning hours",
    "Lower daytime values with evening recovery",
    "Handling of potential missing values"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over trend due to short data horizon (4 days)",
    "Robustness of hourly averaging against noise in limited datasets",
    "Explicit comparison of alternatives (Seasonal Naive vs. averaging) with justification",
    "Data validation through daily average calculations",
    "Adaptation to data constraints by avoiding overparameterized models (e.g., SARIMA)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data-driven heuristics. Includes pattern analysis, multi-method comparison, and computational validation while maintaining practical implementation for the given constraints.",
