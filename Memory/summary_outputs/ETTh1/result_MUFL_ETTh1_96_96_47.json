  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling short-term hourly data with limited historical context (4 days). The analyst prioritized simple averaging methods due to insufficient data for complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. Key considerations included daily seasonality, weekday/weekend differentiation, and data constraints preventing weekly pattern detection. The final approach used hourly averages from available weekdays (Thursday-Friday) repeated for the forecast period, acknowledging potential limitations in weekend/weekday pattern differences.",
