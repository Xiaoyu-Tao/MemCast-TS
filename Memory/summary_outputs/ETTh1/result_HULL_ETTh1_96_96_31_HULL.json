  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with identified daily patterns. The analyst first inspects data characteristics (frequency, seasonality), acknowledges limitations like insufficient weekly data, and selects a simple averaging method due to constraints. Key steps include pattern recognition, handling of potential missing values, and careful output formatting. The approach prioritizes practicality over complex modeling given the data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Peak values during night/early morning hours",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No explicit missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns dominate forecasting due to limited data (4 days), making weekly seasonality unidentifiable",
    "Hourly averaging is preferred over day-specific replication to mitigate weekday/weekend variability",
    "Forecast values require rounding to 3 decimal places for output consistency",
    "Data completeness verification precedes modeling to handle potential missing values"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, data validation, and heuristic modeling, but avoids advanced statistical techniques due to data constraints. Focuses on practical implementation with clear step-by-step justification.",
