  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, prioritizing simplicity and observable daily patterns over complex statistical models. The analyst identified daily seasonality but faced constraints from the short 4-day dataset, ultimately selecting a simple hourly averaging method to generate repeating daily patterns for the forecast period while acknowledging potential limitations around weekly patterns and trend modeling.",
