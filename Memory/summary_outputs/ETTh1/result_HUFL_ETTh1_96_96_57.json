  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly HUFL data using limited historical dataset (96 hours). The analyst identifies daily seasonality and potential trends but prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints. The solution employs a straightforward averaging method after evaluating and dismissing more complex models like SARIMA and ETS as infeasible given the small dataset. The approach emphasizes practicality, pattern recognition, and handling of data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Upward trend in later observations",
    "Handling of potential missing values (not present in provided data)",
    "Weekday-specific patterns (Tuesday-Friday data)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping by hour and averaging across days captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Limited historical data (only 4 days) restricts complex model application",
    "Weekend pattern uncertainty addressed by repeating weekday averages",
    "Explicit rounding protocol (3 decimal places) maintains data consistency",
    "Trend recognition in final day's higher values balanced by averaging approach"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Detailed consideration of advanced models (SARIMA/ETS) followed by deliberate selection of simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of patterns, date calculations, and handling of real-world constraints like missing data warnings.",
