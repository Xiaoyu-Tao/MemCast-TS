  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a cautious approach due to limited data (96 hourly points). While advanced methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were considered, the analysis ultimately adopted a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality. The approach emphasized robustness over complexity, focusing on hourly pattern repetition after verifying stationarity and rejecting weekly seasonality due to insufficient data length.",
