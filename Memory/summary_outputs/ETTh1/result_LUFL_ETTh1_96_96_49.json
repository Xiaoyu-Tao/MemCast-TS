  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality, addresses potential missing values (though none were present), and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes simplicity and completeness of output while acknowledging limitations in capturing trends with minimal historical data.",

    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days to create a daily profile",
