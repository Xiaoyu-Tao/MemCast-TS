  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting a short time-series dataset with 96 hourly points. The analyst identifies daily seasonality but notes data limitations (only 4 days) that preclude complex models. After evaluating SARIMA, exponential smoothing, and naive methods, they select a simple averaging technique as the most robust solution. The approach emphasizes practicality, data constraints, and pattern stability over theoretical complexity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No missing values in the provided data",
    "Unstable daily patterns with hourly variations",
    "Presence of negative values and decimal precision"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Small data size (4 days) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days provides stability for short-term forecasts",
    "Daily patterns show significant variability despite observable seasonality",
    "Forecast generation through repetition of computed 24-hour average patterns"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning with initial consideration of advanced models, but ultimately simplifies to heuristic methods due to data constraints. Includes detailed pattern examination, model trade-off analysis, and step-by-step computational validation.",
