  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting for hourly data with daily seasonality. Initially, advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were considered but ultimately rejected due to constraints in the simulated environment. The final method employed simple averaging per hour-of-day across historical data, prioritizing robustness and ease of implementation over complex modeling. The approach effectively identified seasonality but showed limitations in handling potential trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Prioritization of seasonality capture through hourly grouping",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with initial statistical considerations (SARIMA parameter evaluation, seasonality decomposition) that transitioned to practical heuristics due to implementation constraints. The reasoning included multi-step data inspection but simplified execution.",
