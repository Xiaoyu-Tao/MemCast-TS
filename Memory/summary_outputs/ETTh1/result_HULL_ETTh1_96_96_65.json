  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of a 96-hour time-series dataset for forecasting the next 96 hours. The approach begins with data inspection, identifies daily seasonality and a downward trend, evaluates multiple forecasting methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately adopts a heuristic method combining hourly averaging with linear trend adjustment due to data limitations. The analysis is thorough, incorporating statistical computations and pattern recognition, but relies on practical heuristics over complex models given the small dataset size.",
