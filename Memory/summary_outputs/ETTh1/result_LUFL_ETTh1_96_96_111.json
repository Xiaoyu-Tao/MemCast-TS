  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and practicality, opting for a straightforward hourly averaging method after evaluating alternatives like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing. Key considerations include data completeness, pattern recognition, and handling of potential missing values, with explicit attention to timestamp generation and output formatting.",
