  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited historical data, focusing on handling anomalies and leveraging daily seasonality. The model identifies a constant-value day as an anomaly, excludes it from calculations, and uses a simple averaging method to create a daily profile from non-anomalous days. This profile is repeated for the forecast horizon, balancing simplicity with data constraints.",

Balances statistical considerations (seasonality) with practical constraints like limited data, avoiding overly complex models while maintaining structured analytical steps.",
