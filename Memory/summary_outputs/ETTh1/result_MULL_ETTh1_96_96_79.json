  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach using simple averaging to forecast hourly time-series data. It acknowledges data volatility and the limitations of short historical data (4 days), opting for a heuristic method that computes hourly averages across available days and repeats this pattern for the forecast horizon. The approach is systematic but notes that more advanced models (e.g., SARIMA, LSTM) would be preferable if feasible.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed heuristic analysis. Involves step-by-step data examination, pattern recognition, manual computation of hourly averages, and consideration of method limitations, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to constraints.",
