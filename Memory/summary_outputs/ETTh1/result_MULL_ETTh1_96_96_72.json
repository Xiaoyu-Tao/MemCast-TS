  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, handles an outlier through robust statistical methods, and generates a 96-hour forecast by computing hourly medians from historical data. The approach prioritizes simplicity and robustness over complex modeling due to the short data history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of outliers (e.g., spike/drop anomalies)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "No missing values in provided data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median-based aggregation provides robustness against outliers compared to mean",
    "Limited data constrains model selection (e.g., SARIMA deemed infeasible)",
    "Hourly patterns are portable across forecast days when weekly seasonality is unavailable",
    "Explicit outlier handling is critical for accurate short-term forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step statistical reasoning: involves seasonality detection, outlier analysis, method comparison (SARIMA/ETS/naive), and custom median-based forecasting implementation.",
