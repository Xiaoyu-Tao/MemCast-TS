  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a moderately complex forecasting approach focused on handling short time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst systematically evaluates data characteristics, considers multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days) and absence of weekend patterns. The approach emphasizes practical constraints over theoretical sophistication, with careful attention to missing value handling and pattern anomalies.",

    "Prioritization of daily seasonality (24-hour cycles) as the dominant pattern",
    "Recognition of data limitations: 4-day history insufficient for weekly patterns",

    "Explicit handling of missing value warnings despite complete input data"
