  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on a short historical dataset with clear daily seasonality. It systematically evaluates multiple methods before selecting a simple heuristic model based on average hourly differences and linear extrapolation, acknowledging limitations like data non-stationarity and limited history while providing detailed step-by-step calculations.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
