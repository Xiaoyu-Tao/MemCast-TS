  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on handling limited data (96 points) with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes robustness over complexity by using median-based hourly patterns to account for potential outliers, while explicitly acknowledging constraints like insufficient history for weekly patterns or advanced models. The solution balances statistical considerations with heuristic simplifications suitable for the data scope.",
