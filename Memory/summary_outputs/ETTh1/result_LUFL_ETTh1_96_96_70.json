  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly LUFL data, focusing on daily seasonality detection and pragmatic model selection. Given limited historical data (96 hours), the analyst prioritizes simplicity by implementing a daily-pattern averaging method. The process includes thorough data inspection, consideration of alternatives like weighted averages or complex models (e.g., ETS, ARIMA), and detailed computation of hourly averages, while addressing data nuances like potential outliers and rounding precision.",

  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (low nighttime values, morning peaks, evening declines)",
    "Hourly pattern consistency across days",
    "Potential outliers in recent data (e.g., elevated nighttime values on 2017-04-10)",
    "No missing values in provided history"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24) is the dominant pattern for hourly forecasting",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) constrains model complexity, favoring simple methods over SARIMA/ETS",
    "Recent data deviations may indicate emerging trends but are incorporated via unweighted averaging due to insufficient context",
    "Precision alignment: forecasts rounded to 3 decimals to match input data format",
    "Handling of potential weekly patterns is infeasible with only 4 days of data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data examination and method comparisons, but ultimately employs a simple, interpretable solution due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, outlier checks, and precision considerations.",
