  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. After evaluating multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), the analyst selected a simple hourly averaging technique due to data constraints (4 days of history). The approach acknowledges limitations in capturing trends and weekday patterns but provides a baseline solution through manual computation of 24-hour cyclical averages repeated across forecast days.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized simplicity due to limited historical data (4 days) constraining complex model effectiveness",
    "Addressed day-of-week pattern challenges (forecasting weekdays from history containing weekends)",
    "Used manual hourly averaging as fallback when statistical models became impractical without code execution",
    "Maintained 3-decimal precision consistency with input data format",
    "Acknowledged trade-off between model sophistication and data limitations in final implementation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis with statistical model comparisons, transitioning to heuristic implementation. Demonstrated multi-step reasoning about seasonality and data limitations, though ultimately employed simple arithmetic averaging due to practical constraints.",
