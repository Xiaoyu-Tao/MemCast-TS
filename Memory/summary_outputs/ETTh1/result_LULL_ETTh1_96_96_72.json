  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting for hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability given limited historical data (96 points), focusing on pattern recognition and heuristic methods. Key strengths include thorough data inspection, trend analysis, and clear justification for method selection, though the approach relies on averaging due to data constraints.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Using same-hour averages across multiple days to capture daily seasonality",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data diagnostics (missing value checks, trend analysis) with practical heuristics. Avoids advanced statistical models due to data limitations, focusing instead on interpretable pattern-based averaging.",
