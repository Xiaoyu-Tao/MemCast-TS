  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to hourly time-series forecasting with limited historical data. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by leveraging observed daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging data constraints. The analysis systematically evaluates alternative methods but ultimately selects a straightforward hourly averaging technique due to the small dataset size (only 4 days of history), emphasizing pattern recognition over complex modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data without missing values",
    "Hourly fluctuations with consistent daily cycles"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern and serves as the foundation for forecasting",
    "Limited data (only 4 seasonal cycles) makes complex models like SARIMA or Holt-Winters unstable",
    "Weekend data absence necessitates using aggregated hourly averages regardless of day-of-week",
    "Forecast generation involves repeating averaged daily patterns for the entire horizon",
    "Output formatting requires rounding to match historical data precision (3 decimal places)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong practical simplifications. The reasoning explores advanced methods but deliberately simplifies to heuristic approaches due to data limitations, focusing on pattern extraction and pragmatic implementation over statistical sophistication.",
