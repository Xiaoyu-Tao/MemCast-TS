  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting, focusing on data validation, pattern identification, and practical method selection. The analyst thoroughly examines data completeness, identifies potential seasonality, and selects a simple averaging method due to computational constraints, while addressing data anomalies and formatting requirements.",

    "Robust handling of user warnings about missing values through timestamp validation",
    "Use of grouped hourly averaging to capture daily patterns",
