  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed heuristic approach for multi-step time-series forecasting with limited data. It focuses on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) to forecast an equally long future period (96 hours), emphasizing daily seasonality and day-of-week patterns while acknowledging data constraints that prevent complex modeling.",

    "Heuristic Analysis": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Day-of-week variations (weekday vs weekend patterns)",
    "Anomalous daily behavior (e.g., Monday's abnormal morning spike)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over weekly patterns due to insufficient historical data (only 4 days)",
    "Use of most recent weekday (Tuesday) as template for upcoming weekdays and lone historical Saturday for future Saturday",
    "Explicit handling of data indexing for hourly alignment between historical and forecast periods",
    "Recognition of data limitations preventing statistical modeling (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex heuristic reasoning with multi-step pattern analysis, day-of-week logic, and detailed data indexing, but avoids advanced statistical methods due to data constraints.",
