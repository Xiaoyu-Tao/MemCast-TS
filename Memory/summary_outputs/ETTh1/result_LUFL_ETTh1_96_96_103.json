  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step analysis focused on handling a short time-series dataset with identified anomalies. The approach emphasizes pattern recognition (especially daily seasonality), robust handling of outliers, and practical adaptation to data limitations. The forecaster systematically evaluates multiple methods before selecting a robust median-based approach to mitigate anomalies while preserving daily patterns.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles) is the dominant pattern, but limited data complicates weekly pattern identification",
    "Anomalies (e.g., Saturday evening drop) require robust statistical handling like median aggregation",
    "Forecasts must adapt to data limitations (only 4 days) by leveraging all available days with outlier mitigation",
    "Hourly median aggregation balances pattern preservation and anomaly robustness without arbitrary data alteration"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: combines data inspection, pattern recognition, anomaly assessment, method comparison, and implementation nuances. Addresses data limitations and temporal context (weekday/weekend effects) while justifying methodological choices.",
