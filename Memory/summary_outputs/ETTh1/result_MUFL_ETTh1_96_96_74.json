  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on identifying daily seasonality in a short time series (96 hourly points) and selecting an appropriate forecasting method. The analyst initially considered SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but opted for a simple hourly averaging approach due to limited data length, avoiding overfitting while maintaining interpretability. The method involved creating an average daily profile from historical data and repeating it for the forecast horizon.",
