  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a focused approach to time-series forecasting using a single sample. It identifies clear daily seasonality in the data and addresses the challenge of limited historical data (only 4 days) by employing a simple averaging method. The analysis is systematic, considering data completeness and temporal patterns, but remains constrained to basic heuristics due to the short horizon.",
