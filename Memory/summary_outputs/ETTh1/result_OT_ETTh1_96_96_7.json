  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting with limited and problematic time-series data. The analyst identified significant data quality issues (a 24-hour constant value period indicating missing data) and compensated for the short history (96 hours) by focusing on daily patterns. The solution employed simple averaging of non-anomalous days to create a daily profile, which was repeated for the forecast horizon. The approach prioritizes practicality over statistical sophistication due to data constraints.",
