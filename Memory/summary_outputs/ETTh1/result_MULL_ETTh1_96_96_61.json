  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting focused on short history (96 hourly points) with clear seasonality. It emphasizes handling data limitations through robust methods, considering multiple modeling options before selecting a simple averaging technique. The analysis shows careful pattern recognition, manual computation of hourly averages, and attention to output formatting requirements.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Non-repeating daily patterns (variations across days)",
    "Negative value dominance in afternoon/evening hours",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for short time-series data (4 days)",
    "Using multi-day hourly averaging to smooth seasonal patterns",
    "Manual pattern analysis through day/hour matrix decomposition",
    "Consistent rounding and formatting to match input data specifications",
    "Explicit consideration of data limitations (e.g., insufficient history for weekly seasonality)"
