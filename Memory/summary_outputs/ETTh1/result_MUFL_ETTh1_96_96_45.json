  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling data anomalies and leveraging daily seasonality. It identifies the constant values on the last day as an anomaly, excludes them to avoid bias, and uses simple averaging of same-hour data from valid days to generate a repeating daily pattern forecast. The method is straightforward but effective given data constraints, prioritizing pattern recognition over complex modeling.",
