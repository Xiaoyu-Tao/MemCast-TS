  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory focuses on forecasting 96 hours of hourly data with daily seasonality, starting with advanced statistical models like SARIMA and Holt-Winters but ultimately adopting a robust heuristic method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes handling outliers and potential missing values, leveraging a simple yet effective median-based seasonal pattern repetition for the forecast.",
