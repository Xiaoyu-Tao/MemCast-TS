  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting hourly oil temperature using a median-based heuristic method due to limited historical data (4 days). The approach prioritized robustness against outliers and simplicity, considering but dismissing more complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing due to insufficient training data. Daily seasonality was identified as the primary pattern, with explicit outlier handling and trend analysis.",
