  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and handling data anomalies. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality and data irregularities, evaluates multiple forecasting methods, and selects a simple heuristic approach due to limited historical data. The process emphasizes practical constraints like short data history and handles anomalies without data modification, resulting in a straightforward solution.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Seasonal Naive (repetition of last season)": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of anomalies/outliers (e.g., negative values)",
    "Hourly pattern variations (low nighttime values, morning peaks)",
    "Inconsistent same-hour values across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern for forecasting decisions",
    "Limited historical records (4 days) necessitate simple methods over complex models",
    "Anomalies are noted but not corrected in historical data during forecasting",
    "Forecast horizon repetition leverages the most recent daily pattern as reference",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Combines pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and method evaluation, but simplifies to heuristic implementation due to data limitations. Includes multi-step reasoning about seasonality and practical constraints without advanced statistical modeling.",
