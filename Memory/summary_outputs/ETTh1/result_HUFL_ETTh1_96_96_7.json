  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a robust approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It focuses on handling anomalies, identifying daily patterns, and implementing a simple yet effective median-based method for multi-step forecasting. The analysis prioritizes data quality assessment and practical heuristics over complex models due to data constraints.",

    "Daily seasonality (peaks in evening, dips at night)",
