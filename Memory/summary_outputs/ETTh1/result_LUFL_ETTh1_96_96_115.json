  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on clear daily seasonality. It systematically evaluates methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but opts for a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The analysis is thorough, covering data inspection, pattern recognition, and implementation details, though constrained by the 4-day dataset.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Variation in magnitude by day of week",

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as a fallback for limited data scenarios",
    "Explicit handling of datetime formatting and value rounding",
    "Recognition of weekly pattern limitations with insufficient data",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern analysis and method evaluation, but simplified to heuristic implementation due to data constraints. Includes multi-step reasoning from decomposition considerations to practical execution.",
