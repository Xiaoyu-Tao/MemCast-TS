  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to handling short-term forecasting with limited data and anomalies. The analyst identifies strong daily seasonality and an anomalous spike in the last observed day, leading to the selection of a median-based method for robustness. The approach prioritizes simplicity and resilience over complex modeling due to data constraints, resulting in a repeated daily pattern forecast.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Anomaly detection (spike in last day)",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided series)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Median per hour is preferred over mean to mitigate outlier influence from anomalous days",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling (e.g., SARIMA, weekly seasonality)",
    "Same daily pattern repeated for all forecasted days despite weekday/weekend differences due to insufficient historical granularity",
    "Explicit handling of data completeness vs. potential missing values in problem constraints"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Integrates data pattern recognition, method evaluation (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing), and heuristic adaptation to data limitations, but final implementation uses straightforward statistical aggregation.",
