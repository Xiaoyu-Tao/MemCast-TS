  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data (96 hourly points) with strong daily seasonality. The method prioritizes robustness against outliers by using median hourly values from historical data, repeated cyclically for the forecast horizon. The approach is practical for limited data scenarios but lacks advanced modeling for trends or external factors.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Median aggregation per hour to mitigate outlier influence",
