  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to forecast hourly data with daily seasonality, acknowledging limitations due to the short 4-day history. While considering models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analysis opts for a heuristic approach by averaging hourly values across available days, balancing simplicity and data constraints.",
