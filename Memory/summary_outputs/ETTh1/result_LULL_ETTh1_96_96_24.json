  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a straightforward approach focused on capturing daily seasonality in hourly time-series data. It employs a simple averaging method to handle the 24-hour cyclical pattern, with careful attention to data completeness and output formatting. The analysis is pragmatic for short-term forecasting but relies on basic heuristics without advanced statistical modeling.",
