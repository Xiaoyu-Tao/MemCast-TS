  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on daily seasonality and data limitations. It prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averages from historical data due to the short time series (4 days) and lack of clear trends. The analysis acknowledges potential complexities like weekly patterns but deems them unactionable given insufficient data. Method selection emphasizes robustness against missing values despite their absence in the provided data.",
