  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analytical process focused on handling short-term hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The approach prioritizes robustness against outliers and data constraints, ultimately selecting a median-based heuristic method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The analysis includes thorough method comparisons, explicit pattern recognition, and careful output formatting considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Presence of outliers (e.g., extreme low at 2017-03-01 12:00)",
    "Consistent time-of-day patterns (highs at night, lows midday)",
    "Note on potential missing values (though absent in provided data)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median-based methods preferred over mean for robustness against outliers in short datasets",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) due to insufficient data length",
    "Hourly pattern replication as primary forecasting mechanism for multi-day horizons",
    "Rigorous output formatting adherence (precision rounding, datetime alignment)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: includes data inspection, method comparison, computational implementation, and error-proofing considerations despite simple final heuristic selection.",
