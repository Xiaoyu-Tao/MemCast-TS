  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple heuristics due to computational constraints. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging data limitations and outliers. The method prioritizes simplicity and manual computability over complex statistical modeling, resulting in a straightforward but potentially outlier-sensitive forecast.",
