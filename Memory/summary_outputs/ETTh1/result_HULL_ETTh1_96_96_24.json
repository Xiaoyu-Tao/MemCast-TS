  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 hours of HULL data, focusing on identifying patterns and constraints. It emphasizes daily seasonality detection, acknowledges data limitations (only 4 days of history), and selects a simple averaging method due to the inability to model weekly seasonality. The approach is pragmatic, prioritizing robustness and simplicity given the small dataset and text-based constraints.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Peak loads during certain hours and drops at night",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Complete data in the training period (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary pattern leveraged for forecasting via hourly averaging",
    "Limited historical data prevents modeling weekly seasonality despite observed weekend variations",
    "Averaging same-hour values across multiple days provides robustness for short-term forecasts",
    "Rounding forecasted values to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input data format",
    "Explicit handling of date-time alignment for forecast period generation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern analysis, practical constraints evaluation, and method selection trade-offs, but implements a straightforward averaging solution due to data limitations.",
