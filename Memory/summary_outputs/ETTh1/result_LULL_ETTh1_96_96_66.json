  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to capture daily seasonality, given the short history of 96 hourly data points (4 days). The approach involves computing hourly averages across available days and repeating the pattern for the forecast horizon. The analysis checks for trends and stationarity, concluding that the data lacks a clear trend, making the averaging method appropriate. The reasoning is practical, focusing on simplicity due to computational constraints.",
