  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a heuristic-based forecasting approach focused on identifying daily seasonality and trend patterns. It emphasizes manual decomposition of the time series into daily averages and seasonal components, with trend projection based on recent daily average changes. The method prioritizes simplicity due to computational constraints, resulting in a pragmatic but non-optimized solution.",
