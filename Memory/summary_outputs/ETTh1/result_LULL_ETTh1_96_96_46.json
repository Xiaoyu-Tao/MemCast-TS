  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on leveraging daily seasonality with simple averaging due to limited historical data (4 days). The method prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity, using hourly averages across observed days to project future values. While potential trends are acknowledged, insufficient data leads to reliance on stable seasonal patterns.",
