  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst initially considers SARIMA modeling but rejects it due to insufficient data length (only 4 days), opting instead for a simple averaging method. The approach focuses on leveraging observed hourly patterns while acknowledging data limitations, resulting in a straightforward yet effective solution that prioritizes interpretability over complexity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Higher daytime values and lower nighttime values",
    "No clear trend across days",
    "Complete data with no missing values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short time-series data (≤4 seasonal cycles) limits complex model applicability",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures stable daily patterns when trends are absent",
    "Forecasts for multiple periods can reuse the same daily pattern when data is stationary",
    "Data completeness checks precede modeling decisions",
    "Precision alignment (rounding to 3 decimals) maintains consistency with input data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves initial consideration of advanced models (SARIMA) with justification for simplification, detailed pattern analysis, and systematic implementation of averaging, but avoids computationally intensive techniques.",
