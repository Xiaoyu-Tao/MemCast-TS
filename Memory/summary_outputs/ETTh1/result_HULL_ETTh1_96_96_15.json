  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data. It begins with data quality assessment, identifies seasonality patterns, handles anomalies (a constant-value day), and selects a forecasting method. The approach balances statistical model consideration with practical implementation constraints, ultimately adopting a simple averaging technique due to data anomalies and limited history. The reasoning is thorough, methodical, and emphasizes data-driven pattern recognition.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of data anomalies (constant-value day)",
    "Absence of long-term trend",
    "Handling of missing values/imputation artifacts"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous data (constant-value day) improves forecast reliability",
    "Daily patterns are extracted by averaging corresponding hours across valid days",
    "Seasonality identification precedes model selection (daily cycles confirmed)",
    "Forecast horizon alignment with historical patterns (4 repetitions of 24-hour cycle)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: Includes data diagnostics, seasonality verification, model comparison (Holt-Winters vs. SARIMA), anomaly handling, and pattern-based forecasting. Balances statistical rigor with practical simplifications for implementation.",
