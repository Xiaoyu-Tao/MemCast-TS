  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96-hour oil temperature data using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. The analyst thoroughly evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but selects a heuristic-based solution due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The process includes data validation, pattern analysis, method justification, and detailed manual calculations, resulting in a practical though basic forecasting strategy.",
