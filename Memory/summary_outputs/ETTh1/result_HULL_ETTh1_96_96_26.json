  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting 96 hours of hourly time-series data with limited historical data (4 days). After evaluating advanced methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analyst defaults to a simple hourly averaging technique due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes robustness over complexity, focusing on daily seasonality while acknowledging limitations in capturing weekly patterns. Data completeness is verified, and forecasts are generated systematically with rounding for consistency.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Weekend vs. weekday variations (not modeled due to insufficient data)",
    "Complete data (no missing values in historical points)",
    "Hourly fluctuation patterns (e.g., peak/off-peak hours)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling (e.g., weekly seasonality)",
    "Daily patterns dominate forecasting decisions",
    "Simple averaging by hour provides robustness with small datasets",
    "Explicit handling of timestamp continuity and formatting",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate: Starts with advanced method consideration (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data limitations. Includes data inspection, pattern analysis, and practical implementation steps.",
