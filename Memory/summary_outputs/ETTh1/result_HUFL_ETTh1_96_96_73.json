  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach focused on identifying patterns and applying a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality. The analysis emphasizes data completeness checks, pattern recognition, and practical implementation of a heuristic forecasting method with careful attention to rounding conventions. The approach is logical but relies on advanced statistical models due to its simplicity.",
