  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach combining trend analysis and seasonal decomposition to handle limited historical data (4 days). The analyst evaluates multiple methods before selecting a hybrid model that projects a linear trend while incorporating averaged hourly seasonal components. The process shows careful consideration of data limitations and balances simplicity with statistical rigor.",
