  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. It emphasizes data completeness checks, pattern recognition, and method selection based on data limitations. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness, opting for a straightforward averaging technique due to the short historical data (4 days) and clear daily cycles, while acknowledging but not implementing more complex models like ARIMA or exponential smoothing.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Temperature fluctuations (lower at night, higher during day)",
    "Complete data in provided history (no missing values)",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as baseline method for short-term forecasts with limited data",
    "Explicit handling of data granularity (rounding to 3 decimal places to match input)",
    "Date-time continuity maintenance in forecast output",
    "Recognition of method limitations for trend capture with minimal history"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Combines data inspection, pattern analysis, and method comparison, but simplifies implementation through hourly averaging. Includes detailed computational steps for pattern extraction while avoiding advanced statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
