  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying patterns in a short time-series dataset (96 hourly points) to forecast the next 96 hours. The analyst prioritizes daily seasonality detection, verifies data completeness, and selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data. The approach is pragmatic, emphasizing pattern replication over complex modeling given the constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Absence of strong trend over short horizon",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns dominate short-term forecasting when only 4 days of data are available",
    "Weekly seasonality cannot be captured with limited historical data",
    "Hourly averaging is robust for replicating diurnal cycles in temperature data",
    "Data completeness checks precede modeling decisions",
    "Forecast replication matches the periodicity of observed patterns (4 identical days)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data pattern analysis and practical simplifications. Avoids advanced statistical models in favor of intuitive, pattern-based heuristics suitable for short horizons.",
