  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96 future hourly data points using a short historical dataset. The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, acknowledges data limitations (only 4 days of history), and selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The approach is pragmatic but potentially oversimplified for capturing trends.",

    "Utilization of same-hour averaging across multiple days to capture seasonality",
