  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, starting with advanced model considerations (SARIMA, Prophet) but ultimately adopting a simple averaging method due to data limitations and computational restrictions. The analysis effectively identifies key patterns but shows limited sophistication in trend handling, relying on heuristic pattern replication for the forecast.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Identification of 24-hour seasonality as the dominant pattern",
