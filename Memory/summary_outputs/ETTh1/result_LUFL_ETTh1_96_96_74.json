  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. It identifies clear daily seasonality in the 96-hour dataset and prioritizes simplicity due to the constraints of only 4 days of historical data. The modeler evaluates but dismisses complex methods like SARIMA and Prophet in favor of a heuristic averaging technique, emphasizing interpretability and computational efficiency while addressing data formatting requirements.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model applicability despite clear seasonality",
    "Weekly seasonality cannot be captured without additional historical data",
    "Hourly averaging provides robustness for short-term forecasts when data is limited",
    "Precise rounding conventions must match input data specifications",
    "Date-time alignment requires careful handling for multi-day forecasts"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines method evaluation (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) with practical constraints, but implements a simple heuristic solution. Includes detailed data processing steps and addresses edge cases like rounding and date generation.",
