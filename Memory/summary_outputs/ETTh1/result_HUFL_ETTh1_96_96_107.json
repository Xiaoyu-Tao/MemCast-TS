  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to constraints, focusing on daily seasonality detection and handling potential missing values. After considering advanced models like SARIMA and Holt-Winters, they default to a simple hourly averaging method for its feasibility, while acknowledging data limitations like unclear trends and negative value anomalies.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Potential missing values (explicitly checked)",
    "Negative value anomalies (e.g., at hour 13)",
    "Lack of clear long-term trend"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as a baseline for short-term forecasts with limited data",
    "Explicit handling of negative values as legitimate data points during averaging",
    "Repetition of identified daily patterns for multi-step forecasting",
    "Data rounding to maintain input precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Constraint-driven model selection (prioritizing simplicity over complexity)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Includes initial consideration of advanced models, detailed data inspection, and step-by-step pattern extraction, but ultimately implements a simple heuristic due to data limitations and environmental constraints.",
