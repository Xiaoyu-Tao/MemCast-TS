  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting 96 data points using a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). It identifies daily seasonality but acknowledges insufficient data for complex models like SARIMA. The solution focuses on hourly pattern extraction and repetition, with careful rounding to match original data precision.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Data length (96 points) is insufficient for complex seasonal models like SARIMA",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days captures daily patterns effectively",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimals maintains original data precision",
    "Weekday/weekend patterns cannot be captured due to limited data scope",
    "Reshaping data into 4x24 matrix enables efficient hourly pattern calculation"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Starts with advanced method consideration (SARIMA/ETS), but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to limited data. Includes detailed pattern extraction, rounding logic, and datetime handling.",
