  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It begins by assessing data completeness and seasonality patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach is pragmatic, emphasizing baseline methods when faced with insufficient data for complex models, while carefully considering seasonality and potential day-of-week effects.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of negative values",
    "Potential day-of-week variations",
    "Stable seasonal magnitude (supports additive models)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data horizons (4 days) necessitate simplified approaches over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Negative values preclude multiplicative seasonality models",
    "Day-of-week patterns require more data than available for reliable modeling",
    "Hourly averaging provides a viable baseline for short-term forecasts",
    "Data rounding precision (3 decimals) must match input specifications"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis with practical simplification. Includes thorough evaluation of modeling alternatives, data pattern recognition, and consideration of real-world constraints, but ultimately implements a straightforward heuristic method due to data limitations.",
