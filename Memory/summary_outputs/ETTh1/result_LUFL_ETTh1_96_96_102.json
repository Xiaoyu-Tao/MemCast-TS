  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on leveraging daily seasonality for short-term forecasting. It prioritizes simplicity and robustness, opting for a straightforward averaging method over complex models due to limited data. The analysis effectively identifies patterns, handles data completeness, and generates a complete forecast while acknowledging limitations like the inability to capture trends.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Lower nighttime loads and higher daytime loads",
    "Occasional spikes in load values (e.g., 4.508 at 2017-08-15 20:00)",
    "Complete data without missing values in the provided period"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hour-of-day averaging effective for short-term forecasts",
    "Limited data (only 4 days) restricts the use of complex models like ARIMA or ETS",
    "Unweighted averaging of the same hour across past days provides robustness despite daily variations",
    "Rounding forecasted values to 3 decimal places maintains consistency with input data precision",
    "Forecast repetition across days is necessary when no trend component can be identified"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with clear step-by-step logic. Starts by evaluating advanced models but simplifies to averaging due to data constraints. Includes data inspection, method comparison, manual calculations, and practical implementation steps, but avoids statistical complexity.",
