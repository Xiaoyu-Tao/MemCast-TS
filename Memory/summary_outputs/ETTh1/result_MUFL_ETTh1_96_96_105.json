  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data, focusing on daily seasonality and day-of-week patterns. Limited historical data (4 days) constrained the analysis, leading to a custom averaging method that differentiates between weekdays and weekends. The approach is pragmatic but lacks advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Day-of-week effects (weekday vs. weekend differences)",
    "No clear trend in short-term data",

  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern requiring explicit modeling",
    "Limited historical data necessitates simplifying assumptions about day-of-week patterns",
    "Weekday/weekend differentiation is critical but challenging with sparse data",
    "Averaging same-hour values from comparable days serves as a fallback heuristic",
    "Direct reuse of historical same-day data for matching future days when available"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step heuristic design, involving pattern recognition, day-of-week analysis, and custom averaging rules, but avoids advanced statistical methods due to data constraints.",
