  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting, focusing on identifying patterns, handling anomalies, and selecting an appropriate method given constraints. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality and an anomalous constant-value day but opts for a simple averaging heuristic due to data limitations and the manual analysis context. The process is thorough but ultimately relies on baseline methods after considering more complex models like SARIMA.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality (period=24) for modeling due to observable hourly patterns",
    "Explicit treatment of anomalies (e.g., constant-value day) as outliers to avoid skewing forecasts",
    "Use of heuristic averaging as fallback when complex models are impractical for manual execution",
    "Date-aware contextual analysis (e.g., holiday considerations for New Year's Eve/Day)",
    "Consistent rounding of outputs to match input data precision (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step reasoning: Includes data inspection, model consideration (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing), anomaly handling, and pattern extraction, but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to implementation constraints.",
