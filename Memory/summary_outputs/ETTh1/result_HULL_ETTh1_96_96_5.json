  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach for short-term time-series forecasting using a simple yet effective method. The model identifies key characteristics of the data (daily seasonality, stationarity, and completeness), then applies hourly averaging to capture the repeating pattern. The solution prioritizes practicality given the limited historical data (96 hours) and directly addresses the forecast horizon of 96 hours.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Stationary data (no significant trend)",
    "Complete dataset (no missing values)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging values across days to capture daily seasonality",
    "Explicit trend verification by comparing first/last days before selecting method",
    "Handling forecast horizon by repeating the computed daily pattern for multiple periods",
    "Data rounding to maintain consistency with input precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Leveraging periodicity alignment (96-hour forecast matches 4x24h daily cycles)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Combines data inspection, pattern recognition, and arithmetic operations. Avoids advanced statistical models due to limited data, focusing instead on intuitive seasonal decomposition and averaging heuristics.",
