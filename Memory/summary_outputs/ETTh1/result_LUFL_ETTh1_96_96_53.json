  "overall_summary": "The analysis focused on handling daily seasonality and an anomalous constant-value day within a 96-hour LUFL time series. The primary approach used hourly median values across available days (excluding outlier influence) repeated for 4 forecast days. Reasoning demonstrated robust anomaly handling through median-based heuristics while maintaining simplicity given limited data availability.",

    "Median-based approach preferred over mean to handle constant-value outlier day",
