  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, multi-step approach to forecasting with significant missing data challenges. The analyst prioritizes data imputation using pattern replication from available non-missing periods, identifies daily seasonality, and employs a simple averaging method for forecasting due to limited historical information. The approach is pragmatic but constrained by data scarcity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Handling of missing values",
    "Higher nighttime values (00:00-08:00) and lower daytime values",
    "Pattern replication for imputation"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Missing values (represented as zeros) require imputation using observed daily patterns",
    "Daily profiles are constructed by averaging available non-missing values per hour",
    "Forecasts assume stationarity and repeat the derived daily pattern due to insufficient trend data",
    "Actual observed values take precedence over imputed data when available",
    "Rounding forecasted values to match original data precision (3 decimals)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: involves data diagnosis, pattern recognition, sophisticated missing value imputation, seasonal modeling, and practical trade-offs between data limitations and forecasting requirements.",
