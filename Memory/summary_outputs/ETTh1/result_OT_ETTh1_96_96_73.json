  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting for hourly oil temperature data. The analyst begins by verifying data completeness and identifying daily seasonality patterns. After considering advanced models like SARIMA and exponential smoothing, they opt for a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The solution involves calculating hourly averages across available days and projecting this pattern forward, with careful attention to datetime handling and output formatting.",
