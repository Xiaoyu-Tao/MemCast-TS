  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process begins by evaluating the data for missing values and identifying daily seasonality (24-hour cycles) as a key pattern. Initial consideration of SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models is noted, but due to limited data size (96 points) and the absence of a strong trend, a simple heuristic approach is ultimately chosen. The final method involves averaging each hour across the available 4 days and repeating this pattern for the forecast period, prioritizing simplicity and seasonality capture over complex modeling.",

    "Daily temperature fluctuations (lower at night, higher during daytime) drive seasonality modeling",
    "Use of simple averaging heuristics due to limited historical data (4 days)",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with initial statistical model exploration (SARIMA parameter analysis, stationarity checks), transitioning to practical heuristic methods. Combines theoretical model considerations with pragmatic implementation constraints.",
