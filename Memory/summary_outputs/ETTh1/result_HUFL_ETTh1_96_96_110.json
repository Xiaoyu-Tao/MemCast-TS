  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, naive methods), and selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The solution prioritizes robustness over complexity, focusing on clear daily seasonality while acknowledging limitations like the inability to capture weekly patterns.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Load drops during daytime, rises at night",
    "Relatively constant seasonal amplitude",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling and weekly seasonality capture",
    "Additive seasonality preferred due to stable amplitude across days",
    "Simple methods (hourly averaging) favored over SARIMA/ETS for short datasets",
    "Forecast generation via repeated daily patterns balances accuracy and simplicity",
    "Data rounding (3 decimals) maintains consistency with input precision"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough model evaluation, but ultimately implements simple solution due to data limitations. Includes detailed data pattern examination, method comparison, and step-by-step computation while avoiding over-parameterization.",
