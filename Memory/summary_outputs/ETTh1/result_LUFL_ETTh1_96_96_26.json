  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying seasonality and selecting a simple yet effective method. The analyst acknowledges data constraints (only 4 days of hourly data) and prioritizes capturing daily patterns while explicitly addressing potential challenges like missing values and weekly seasonality, though the latter is deemed unfeasible. The solution emphasizes robustness and output formatting compliance.",

    "Limited data (≤4 days) necessitates simple methods like hourly averaging over complex models (SARIMA/Prophet)",
    "Explicit handling of timestamps and output formatting is critical for alignment with requirements",
    "Daily patterns dominate forecasting when weekly seasonality can't be modeled due to insufficient data",
    "Rounding conventions (3 decimals) must match input data specifications"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves data inspection, model consideration (SARIMA/ETS/Prophet), and detailed computations, but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, anomaly checks, and output formatting.",
