  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach to time-series data with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The modeler identifies daily seasonality but notes data volatility and the absence of weekly patterns due to the short timeframe. After considering and dismissing more complex methods like SARIMA and seasonal decomposition, they settle on a simple hourly averaging technique, prioritizing practicality over sophistication given the data constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "High volatility in daytime values",
    "Presence of negative value outliers",
    "Inconsistent daily patterns across days",
    "Complete historical data with missing value awareness"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents weekly seasonality modeling and complex statistical approaches",
    "Hourly averaging chosen as optimal balance between pattern capture and implementation simplicity",
    "Negligible linear trend observed over the short timeframe",
    "Volatile days (e.g., 2017-09-28) significantly impact average calculations",
    "Explicit handling of datetime formatting for forecast output alignment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial consideration of advanced methods (SARIMA, decomposition), but ultimately implements simple heuristic due to data limitations. Features detailed pattern examination and step-by-step computational validation.",
