  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical, data-driven approach focusing on observable patterns in limited data. It prioritizes simplicity by leveraging clear daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints. The method demonstrates thorough computation and rounding considerations but avoids complex modeling due to insufficient historical data points.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary forecasting anchor, with hourly patterns averaged across available days",
    "Limited data (4 days) constrains model complexity, favoring heuristic approaches over statistical models",
    "Explicit handling of rounding precision to match original data format, including special cases for negative values",
    "Rejection of complex models (e.g., SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) due to insufficient seasonal cycles"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed computational steps and rounding logic, but relies on simple heuristics for the core forecasting method.",
