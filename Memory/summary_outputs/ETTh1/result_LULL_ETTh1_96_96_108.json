  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality for short-term forecasting. The model prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical data (96 hourly points), opting for a straightforward averaging method instead of complex statistical models. Key strengths include thorough data inspection, clear pattern recognition, and careful handling of data formatting, though the approach is constrained by insufficient data for capturing weekly seasonality.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Lower values at night, higher during daytime",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Minimal long-term trend observed"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days to capture daily patterns",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern for the entire forecast horizon",
    "Rounding predictions to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Explicit consideration of data limitations (4-day history) for method selection",
    "Date sequence generation aligned with original data frequency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple: Focuses on heuristic pattern extraction and averaging, avoiding complex statistical models due to data constraints. Includes data validation and rounding logic but lacks advanced techniques like trend adjustment or residual analysis.",
