  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analysis of a time-series forecasting task with hourly data, focusing on handling anomalies and seasonality. The analyst identifies data irregularities (a constant-value day and extreme outliers), evaluates multiple modeling approaches, and ultimately implements a robust median-based heuristic method due to data limitations. The process emphasizes practical trade-offs between model sophistication and reliability given the constraints.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Anomaly handling is critical: Constant-value days and extreme outliers require mitigation (e.g., exclusion or median imputation)",
    "Short data horizons limit complex modeling: Only 4 days of data preclude weekly seasonality capture, favoring simple robust methods",
    "Median-based typical day construction effectively normalizes anomalies while preserving daily patterns",
    "Trade-off awareness: Explicit rejection of SARIMA/STL due to implementation constraints despite theoretical suitability"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step reasoning: Combines data diagnostics, anomaly handling, method comparison, and heuristic implementation, though avoids computationally intensive statistical modeling due to practical constraints.",
