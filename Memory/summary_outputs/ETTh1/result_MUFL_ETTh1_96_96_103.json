  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed heuristic approach for short-term time-series forecasting with clear daily seasonality. It focuses on handling limited historical data (4 days) by combining seasonal pattern averaging with linear trend projection, emphasizing practical adjustments for non-stationarity and irregularities without external variables.",
