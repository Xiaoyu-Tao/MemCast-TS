  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, handles potential outliers through median aggregation, and creates a typical daily pattern that is repeated for the forecast horizon. The method prioritizes robustness over complexity due to data constraints, focusing on heuristic analysis and statistical aggregation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Outlier presence (e.g., abnormal peak on 2016-09-08)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary pattern leveraged for forecasting",
    "Median aggregation per hour mitigates outlier effects in the training data",
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents modeling weekly seasonality or trends",
    "Forecast values rounded to 3 decimals to match input data precision",
    "Typical day pattern repeated cyclically for multi-step forecasting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition, statistical aggregation (median), and heuristic adjustments for outliers, while avoiding advanced models due to data limitations.",
