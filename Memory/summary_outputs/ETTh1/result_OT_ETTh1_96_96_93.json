  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with hourly oil temperature data, focusing on handling short historical data (96 points) and daily seasonality. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, naive approaches) before settling on a simple averaging technique due to computational constraints. Key considerations include identifying patterns, handling potential anomalies, and addressing the challenge of forecasting without model execution. The solution prioritizes practicality by using hourly averages across available days, though it acknowledges limitations in capturing recent trends.",
