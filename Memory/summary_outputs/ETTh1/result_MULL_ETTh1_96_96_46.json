  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis focused on short-term forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The approach emphasizes identifying daily seasonality, evaluating model constraints, and selecting a practical solution through method comparison. Key considerations include data completeness, pattern recognition, and computational feasibility, leading to a simple yet justified averaging technique.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "Negative value range with daily fluctuations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data history (4 days) restricts complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA, Prophet)",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, overriding weekly seasonality due to insufficient data",
    "Simple averaging per hour across historical days provides noise reduction while preserving core patterns",
    "Output precision alignment with input data (rounding to 3 decimal places)",
    "Explicit comparison of alternative approaches (e.g., repeating last day vs. hourly averages)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step evaluation: Includes data inspection, method comparison, statistical calculations, and implementation details, though ultimately selects a simple heuristic due to data constraints.",
