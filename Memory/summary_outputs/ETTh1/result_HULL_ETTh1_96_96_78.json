  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling limited data (96 hourly points) with suspected daily seasonality. While considering advanced methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analysis ultimately adopts a simple hourly averaging technique due to data constraints and inconsistent patterns. The solution emphasizes robustness against potential missing values and produces a repeating daily pattern forecast.",

    "Data size limitations (4 days) preclude weekly seasonality analysis",
