  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. The model identifies diurnal patterns in hourly transformer load data, checks for missing values and trends, and adopts a straightforward method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The approach prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity over complex modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal pattern)",
    "Higher nighttime loads with daytime dips",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures recurring daily patterns when data is limited",
    "Stationarity assumed due to absence of clear trend across 4 days",
    "Anomalous peaks (e.g., last day's high) are incorporated into averages without adjustment",
    "Forecast generated by replicating the averaged daily pattern for future days",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Low complexity: Uses basic arithmetic operations and pattern replication without advanced statistical models. Focuses on pragmatic solutions given data constraints.",
