  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a straightforward forecasting approach for a constant time series. The forecaster identifies the absence of missing values in the provided data and uses a naive constant-value extrapolation method for the next 96 hours. The process emphasizes timestamp generation precision, output format adherence, and validation of data patterns, resulting in a simple yet methodical solution.",
