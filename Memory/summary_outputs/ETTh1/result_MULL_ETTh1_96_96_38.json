  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, considers multiple modeling techniques (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The process includes thorough data inspection, handling of negative values, and careful rounding while acknowledging limitations of short time series.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal variation)",
    "Presence of negative values and zeros",
    "No explicit missing values in historical data",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity (hourly averaging) over complex models due to limited 4-day dataset",
    "Explicit handling of negative values during averaging and rounding",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimals using round-half-up method",
    "Repeating averaged daily patterns for multi-day forecasts",
    "Acknowledgment of data limitations for stable seasonal modeling"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of statistical methods, but reverts to simple heuristics due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, outlier consideration, and rounding protocols.",
