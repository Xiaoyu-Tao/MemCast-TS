  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analysis of a short time-series dataset (96 hourly points) for forecasting transformer load. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling approaches, and develops a custom decomposition method to handle data limitations. The approach is pragmatic, emphasizing robustness through heuristic adjustments and statistical decomposition while acknowledging constraints like limited historical records and potential day-of-week effects.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Short-term trend in daily averages",
    "Stabilization of daily levels in recent data",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history necessitates simple, robust methods over complex models like SARIMA or Prophet",
    "Decomposition into daily level and hourly seasonal deviations is effective for capturing patterns",
    "Day-of-week effects are identifiable but unmodelable due to insufficient historical data",
    "Forecast daily levels should align with recent observations (e.g., last day's average)",
    "Average hourly deviations must maintain zero-mean properties to preserve daily level consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical decomposition, heuristic adjustments, and calendar-aware considerations, balancing mathematical rigor with practical constraints.",
