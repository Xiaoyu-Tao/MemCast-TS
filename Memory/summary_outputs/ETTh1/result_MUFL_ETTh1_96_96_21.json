  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting short time-series data with strong daily seasonality. The analyst identifies clear diurnal patterns, acknowledges data limitations (only 96 hourly points), and selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The approach includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and careful handling of data formatting requirements.",

  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Higher values at night/lower values during daytime",
    "Consistent diurnal cycle with varying peak magnitudes",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simple methods like hourly averaging instead of complex models (e.g., SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)",
    "Forecasts generated by repeating averaged 24-hour patterns across future days",
    "Explicit rounding of forecasts to 3 decimal places to match input data precision",
    "Awareness of potential missing values despite their absence in provided data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Includes data exploration, alternative method consideration, and multi-step calculations, but constrained by data limitations to a fundamentally simple averaging approach.",
