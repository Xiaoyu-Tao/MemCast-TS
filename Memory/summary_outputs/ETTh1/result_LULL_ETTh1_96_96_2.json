  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to short-term forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). After considering advanced methods like SARIMA for daily patterns, the analysis defaults to simple hourly means due to data constraints and implementation feasibility. The process emphasizes data completeness checks, trend observation, and practical trade-offs between model sophistication and data limitations.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling but suffices for daily seasonality capture",
    "Simple hourly averaging serves as a practical baseline for short-term forecasts",

    "Recent data weighting considered but rejected for simplicity",
