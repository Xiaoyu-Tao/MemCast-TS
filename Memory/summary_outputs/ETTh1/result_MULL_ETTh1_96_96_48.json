  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a cautious approach focused on handling limited data (96 hourly points) and potential missing values. The primary method uses simple hourly averaging to capture daily patterns while acknowledging limitations around weekly seasonality due to short history. The solution prioritizes simplicity to avoid overfitting, with thorough data validation and clear pattern replication logic.",

    "Hourly averaging chosen due to short history and need for multi-step forecasting",
