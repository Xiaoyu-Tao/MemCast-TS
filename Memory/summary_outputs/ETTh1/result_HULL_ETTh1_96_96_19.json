  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality and weekday/weekend patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The solution focuses on pragmatic pattern extraction from available weekdays, with careful consideration of temporal alignment and output formatting.",

    "Prioritization of weekday data when forecasting weekdays, excluding weekend patterns",
    "Averaging corresponding hours across similar days to create a typical daily profile",
