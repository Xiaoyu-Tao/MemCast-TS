  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach for multi-step time-series forecasting using decomposition methods. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and a strong downward trend in the 96-hour oil temperature data. Due to the short history (only 4 days), they reject complex models like SARIMA in favor of a practical decomposition approach combining linear trend projection with seasonal indices. The method is data-adaptive, accounts for limitations of the dataset, and emphasizes simplicity while addressing key patterns.",
