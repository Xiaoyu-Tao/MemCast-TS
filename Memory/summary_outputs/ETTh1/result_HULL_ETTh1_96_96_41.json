  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a univariate time-series forecasting approach for 96-hour-ahead predictions using 96 historical hourly data points. The analyst identifies strong daily seasonality (24-hour patterns) but faces challenges due to limited data (only 4 days) and potential day-of-week effects. After considering and rejecting complex models like SARIMA due to data constraints, the solution defaults to a simple averaging method. The reasoning is thorough, addressing data patterns, model limitations, and practical implementation details like rounding.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "High nighttime values and low daytime values",
    "Pattern variability across days",
    "Negative values during daytime hours"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simpler models over complex statistical approaches",
    "Daily seasonality dominates the pattern but shows day-to-day variability",
    "Forecast horizon length (96 hours) equals historical data length, increasing uncertainty",
    "Day-of-week effects (weekend vs. weekday) are acknowledged but unaddressed due to data gaps",
    "Rounding strategy (round half to even) ensures consistency with input data format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis with detailed pattern examination and model consideration, but simplifies to heuristic implementation due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, outlier considerations, and practical output formatting.",
