  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive approach to time-series forecasting, starting with data inspection and pattern identification, then evaluating statistical methods like SARIMA, and finally implementing a heuristic solution due to simulation constraints. The analyst prioritizes handling seasonality and trends, adapts to data limitations, and provides a deterministic forecast through pattern replication with linear decay.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality must be explicitly modeled, typically via seasonal differencing or pattern replication",
    "Short data horizons (96 points) favor simpler statistical models over complex ML approaches",
    "Trend extrapolation requires careful decay adjustments to avoid unrealistic projections",
    "Heuristic methods (e.g., scaling recent patterns) provide viable alternatives when model execution is constrained"
