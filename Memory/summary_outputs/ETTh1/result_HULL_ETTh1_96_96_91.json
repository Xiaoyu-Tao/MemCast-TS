  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting with limited historical data. It identifies daily seasonality patterns but notes inconsistencies across days, leading to the selection of a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes feasibility over complexity, focusing on generating a complete forecast while addressing data formatting requirements.",
