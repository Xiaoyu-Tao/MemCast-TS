  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process begins by identifying key characteristics of the time-series data (hourly frequency, 4-day duration, daily seasonality) and evaluates multiple forecasting approaches. While SARIMA is initially considered for its seasonal handling capabilities, the analysis ultimately adopts a simple averaging method due to data size constraints (96 points) and operational practicality. The final approach focuses on extracting and repeating a 24-hour average pattern from historical data, prioritizing simplicity and interpretability over complex modeling.",

    "Recognition of strong daily periodicity (s=24) as the dominant pattern",
    "Adaptation to data limitations through heuristic averaging instead of parametric modeling",
    "Explicit parameter consideration for SARIMA (1,0,1)(1,1,1)[24] before rejecting due to dataset size",

    "Conscious avoidance of overfitting through method simplification"

Includes detailed pattern extraction and manual computation of 24 hourly averages while maintaining awareness of method limitations.",
