  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 future hourly values using 96 historical points with clear daily seasonality but limited weekly pattern detection due to short data span. The analysis considered multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but ultimately implemented a simple averaging approach due to data constraints, creating a daily profile from historical same-hour averages and repeating it for the forecast period. The solution acknowledged limitations from including an anomalous Saturday in the averages but maintained this as the most feasible approach given available data.",

Included seasonality recognition, anomaly detection, and weighting strategies before simplifying due to data limitations.",
