  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on simplicity and efficiency. The analyst identifies key data characteristics, considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but ultimately selects a straightforward averaging method due to computational constraints. The approach prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while acknowledging limitations in handling trends, resulting in a clear, executable solution.",
