  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited historical data (4 days). While advanced methods like SARIMA and Holt-Winters were considered, the analysis ultimately employed simple hourly averaging due to insufficient seasonal cycles for robust model training. The solution emphasizes handling daily patterns while acknowledging data limitations and potential inconsistencies in observed seasonality.",
