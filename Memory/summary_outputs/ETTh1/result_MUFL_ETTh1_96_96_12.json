  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and weekday-weekend patterns but faces challenges due to the short history (only 4 days). After considering and rejecting complex models like exponential smoothing due to data constraints, they implement a simple averaging method. The solution focuses on extracting a typical weekday pattern from available data and repeating it for the forecast horizon, with careful consideration of date alignment and output formatting.",
