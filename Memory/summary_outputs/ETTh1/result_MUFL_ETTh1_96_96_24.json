  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a consistent approach to short-term forecasting using simple averaging methods. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality patterns in hourly data, leveraging historical same-hour averages for future predictions. The approach is practical for limited data (4 days) and emphasizes data completeness, timestamp handling, and step-by-step computation.",
