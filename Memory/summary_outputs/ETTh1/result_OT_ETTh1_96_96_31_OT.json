  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst carefully evaluates multiple methods, acknowledges data constraints, and selects a simple averaging technique due to insufficient data for complex models. Key considerations include seasonality detection, trend analysis, and precision handling, with a practical focus on implementable solutions given the 4-day data limitation.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (temperature fluctuations)",
    "Potential upward trend (unconfirmed due to short history)",
    "Complete data segments (no missing values in provided window)",
    "Hourly frequency patterns"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling like ARIMA/ETS",
    "Hourly averaging robustly captures daily seasonality with minimal data",
    "Precision handling: Maintain input's 6-decimal format in outputs",
    "Weekly seasonality consideration discarded due to insufficient data",
    "Explicit comparison of forecasting options (seasonal naive vs. averaging)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough methodological evaluation. Includes data decomposition, multi-method comparison, precision management, and implementation logic, though constrained to heuristic solutions by data limitations.",
