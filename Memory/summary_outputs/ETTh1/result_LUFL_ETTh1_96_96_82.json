  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints prevent modeling weekly patterns. After evaluating SARIMA and exponential smoothing as unstable options, they default to a simple averaging method that computes hourly means across available days, repeated for the forecast horizon. The approach emphasizes robustness and simplicity given the data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Variation by day of the week (e.g., Sunday vs. weekday patterns)",
    "No significant trend observed",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex methods like SARIMA or weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Daily patterns are stable enough to justify hourly averaging across available days",
    "Day-of-week variations exist but cannot be leveraged due to single instances per weekday",
    "Rounding forecasted values to match input data precision (3 decimals) is essential",
    "Recent-day weighting considered but rejected due to uncertainty in pattern transitions"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step data examination (pattern recognition, seasonality assessment), method evaluation, and computational rigor for hourly averages, but ultimately selects a simple heuristic due to data constraints.",
