  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-term hourly data with daily seasonality. The model prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical data (only 96 points), emphasizing pattern recognition, data completeness verification, and practical implementation. Key strengths include thorough data inspection, consideration of multiple methods, and attention to output formatting, though the approach relies heavily on basic averaging given data constraints.",

    "Daily seasonality (recurring 24-hour patterns)",
    "Absence of long-term trend",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritize daily pattern extraction when data spans only 4 days",
    "Use hourly averaging to smooth noise and capture seasonality",
    "Verify data completeness before analysis despite warnings about potential missing values",
    "Round forecasts to 3 decimal places to match input precision",
    "Repeat averaged daily patterns for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data preprocessing and method justification, but relies on simple averaging due to limited data. Includes multi-step validation (missing value checks, pattern analysis) and detailed output formatting considerations.",
