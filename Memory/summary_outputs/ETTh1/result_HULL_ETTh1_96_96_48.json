  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data with a short history (96 points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, evaluates multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The process emphasizes pattern recognition, robustness against potential missing values, and practical implementation within computational limitations.",
