  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data sequences with clear daily seasonality. It emphasizes simplicity and adaptability, opting for a straightforward hourly averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days) while acknowledging the limitations of more complex models like SARIMA or Holt-Winters in this context. The analysis prioritizes data completeness and pattern consistency, with careful attention to rounding and formatting outputs.",
