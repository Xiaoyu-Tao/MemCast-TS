{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (96 hourly points) and the challenge of capturing weekly seasonality. The analysis acknowledges data constraints, explores potential methods like SARIMA and Holt-Winters, but ultimately adopts a daily-hourly average approach to handle the short series. The solution prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex modeling, with explicit handling of day-of-week limitations and rounding conventions.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No detected missing values in provided data",
    "Potential day-of-week variations (acknowledged but unmodeled)",
    "Stable hourly patterns across available days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Use of hourly averages across available days as baseline forecast",
    "Explicit consideration of day-of-week impacts despite insufficient data for modeling",
    "Data limitation-driven method selection (4 days insufficient for weekly seasonality)",
    "Precision management through 3-decimal rounding mirroring input data format"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with structured evaluation of multiple approaches before settling on a simple solution. Includes detailed data inspection, seasonal pattern analysis, and practical implementation considerations despite limited data complexity.",
