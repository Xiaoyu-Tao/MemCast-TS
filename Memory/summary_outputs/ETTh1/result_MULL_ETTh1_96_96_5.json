  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying daily seasonality patterns in hourly transformer load data. It employs simple averaging techniques due to limited historical data (only 4 days), prioritizing robustness over complex modeling. The analysis thoroughly examines data characteristics, validates assumptions about missing values, and systematically computes hourly averages while acknowledging limitations in trend detection.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher nighttime values (00:00-04:00)",
    "Lower daytime values with morning dips",
    "Stable hourly patterns across days",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, with consistent peaks at night and troughs during daytime",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models",
    "Hourly averaging smooths noise while preserving seasonal characteristics",
    "Trend analysis is unreliable with short time horizons",
    "Explicit validation of data completeness before processing"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with step-by-step data examination and manual pattern verification, but uses simple heuristics (hourly averaging) due to data constraints. Avoids advanced statistical models in favor of interpretable, data-driven calculations.",
