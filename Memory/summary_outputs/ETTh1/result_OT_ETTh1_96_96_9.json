  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting for a time series with clear daily seasonality and limited historical data. The analyst identifies the 24-hour pattern, checks for trends, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes robustness over complexity, with detailed manual calculations ensuring transparency.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable pattern without significant trend",
    "Complete data in the provided segment",
    "Temperature peaks during daytime"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (only 4 days) restricts complex model usage like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging captures daily patterns effectively when trends are absent",
    "Manual decomposition and pattern repetition simplify forecasting",
    "Data reshaping (4 days × 24 hours) enables efficient hourly averaging",
    "Forecast horizon matches historical seasonality cycle length (96 hours)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with emphasis on data inspection and manual calculations, avoiding advanced statistical models due to data limitations. Focuses on practical, explainable heuristics.",
