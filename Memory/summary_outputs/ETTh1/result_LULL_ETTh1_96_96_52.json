  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple methods, and selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The analysis is logical and thorough, addressing seasonality, missing values, and day-of-week effects while acknowledging limitations in capturing weekly patterns.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "No clear trend observed",
    "Day-of-week variations (acknowledged but not modeled)",
    "No missing values in the provided segment"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents modeling weekly seasonality or using complex models effectively",
    "Daily patterns are captured by averaging corresponding hours across available days",
    "Forecast assumes consistent daily patterns across different days of the week due to data constraints",
    "Recent data points are not weighted higher due to insufficient history for meaningful weighting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step evaluation of methods and data patterns, but simplifies to a basic averaging approach due to data limitations. Includes detailed data examination and method comparison before implementation.",
