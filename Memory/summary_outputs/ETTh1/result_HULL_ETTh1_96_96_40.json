  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach focused on leveraging observed patterns and data limitations. It prioritizes simplicity due to the small dataset (96 hourly points) and emphasizes handling day-of-week seasonality. The analyst avoids complex models like ARIMA or ETS in favor of a tailored averaging method that accounts for weekday/weekend differences, ensuring the forecast aligns with the upcoming period.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour periodicity)",
    "Weekday vs. weekend pattern differentiation",

  "key_insights": [
    "Forecasts for weekdays should prioritize historical weekday data (Thursday/Friday) over weekends due to pattern differences",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex statistical models",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week alignment between historical data and forecast period",
    "Rounding forecasted values to 3 decimals to match input precision"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves pattern recognition, day-of-week analysis, and tailored averaging, but intentionally avoids advanced statistical models due to data constraints. Focuses on practical adaptation to observed seasonality.",
