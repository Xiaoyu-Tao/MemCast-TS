  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach focused on identifying seasonality and handling data constraints. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to the short historical data (96 points), selecting a heuristic method that repeats the last observed daily cycle. Key considerations include resolving ambiguities around missing values and ensuring the forecast output meets the requirement of 96 complete points without complex modeling.",
