  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. The method is logically structured, addressing data completeness, pattern identification, and practical constraints, though it acknowledges limitations in handling potential weekly patterns or trends due to limited historical data.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (circadian rhythm)",
    "Handling of missing values (noted but not present)",
    "Short-term pattern repetition"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns are captured by averaging corresponding hours across historical days",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts trend analysis and weekly pattern identification",
    "Assumption of stationarity in daily patterns due to short history",
    "Explicit handling of timestamp continuity and rounding conventions",
    "Acknowledgment of method simplicity versus advanced models (e.g., SARIMA, Prophet)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with clear step-by-step logic, focusing on heuristic pattern extraction. Balances statistical considerations (seasonality averaging) with practical constraints, but avoids advanced modeling due to data limitations.",
