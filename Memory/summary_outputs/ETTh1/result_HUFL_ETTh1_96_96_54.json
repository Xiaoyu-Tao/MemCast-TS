  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting using 96 hours of HUFL data. It identifies daily seasonality and data limitations, evaluates multiple methods (including seasonal ARIMA and exponential smoothing), and ultimately implements a simple averaging technique due to limited historical records. The approach emphasizes robustness given data constraints, with thorough validation of patterns and careful handling of numerical precision.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Slight downward trend across days",
    "Intra-day value variations",
    "Complete data in provided window (no missing values)",
    "Potential outliers in specific hours"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model application despite observed seasonality",
    "Hourly averaging provides robustness against short-term fluctuations when historical data is scarce",
    "Day-of-week considerations (e.g., Sunday vs. Monday patterns) are acknowledged but unaddressed due to insufficient data",
    "Numerical precision maintenance through rounding to match original data format",
    "Explicit handling of potential outliers through mean aggregation without adjustment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: Initial consideration of advanced models, followed by practical simplification due to data constraints, detailed pattern examination, and methodical implementation with validation checks.",
