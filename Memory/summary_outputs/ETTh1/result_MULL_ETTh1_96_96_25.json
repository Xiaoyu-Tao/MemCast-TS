  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data. The analyst begins by verifying data completeness and identifying patterns, considers multiple modeling techniques (including SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The approach prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while acknowledging limitations in handling trends or anomalies. The forecast is generated by averaging hourly values across existing days and repeating the pattern.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Variation in daily patterns",
    "Potential outliers (e.g., low 00:00 value on last day)",
    "No clear long-term trend"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit handling of decimal precision to match input data format",
    "Recognition of data limitations despite absence of missing values in sample",
    "Repetition of averaged daily pattern for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of statistical methods, but simplified implementation due to data constraints. Includes data inspection, pattern analysis, model comparison, and manual computation.",
