  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a cautious approach to forecasting with limited historical data (4 days) and an identified anomaly (constant values on the last day). The analyst prioritized handling potential missing values and holiday patterns while using simple averaging methods due to data constraints. The final approach used averaged hourly patterns from non-anomalous days, repeated across the forecast horizon.",
