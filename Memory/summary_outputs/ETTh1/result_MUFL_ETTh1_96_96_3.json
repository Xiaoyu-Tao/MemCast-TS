  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, handling data constraints, and selecting a practical forecasting method. Key considerations include daily seasonality detection, potential weekly pattern limitations, and robustness against missing values. The approach prioritizes simplicity and interpretability given the small dataset, opting for hourly averaging over complex models due to insufficient data for trend or weekly seasonality modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Decreasing trend in daily levels",
    "Complete data without missing values in the observed period",
    "Hourly pattern consistency across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing daily seasonality over weekly patterns due to limited historical data (only 4 days)",
    "Using hourly average as a robust method when complex models are impractical",
    "Handling potential missing values through aggregation (averaging)",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Repeating the same daily pattern for multi-day forecasts when trend modeling is infeasible"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints. Combines pattern recognition, practical trade-off analysis (e.g., ignoring weekly seasonality due to data limitations), and step-by-step computational validation. Avoids advanced statistical models due to small dataset but includes thorough error-checking and data handling.",
