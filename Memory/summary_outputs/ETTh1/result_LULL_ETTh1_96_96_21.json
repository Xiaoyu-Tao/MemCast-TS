  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on daily seasonality identification and simple averaging methods. The analysis acknowledges data constraints (only 4 days) and rejects complex models like SARIMA due to insufficient data, opting instead for a computationally efficient solution. The reasoning is thorough, considering alternatives, data anomalies, and practical implementation details.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

    "Low values at night",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant and most reliable pattern for forecasting with limited data",
    "Small datasets (≤1 week) preclude weekly seasonality analysis or complex model fitting",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days provides robustness against anomalies",
    "Date-aware pattern repetition is effective for multi-day forecasts",
    "Minimal overall trend observed in the 4-day window reduces modeling complexity"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, method evaluation (SARIMA/Holt-Winters rejection), anomaly detection, and practical implementation with date handling, but ultimately selects a simple solution due to data limitations.",
