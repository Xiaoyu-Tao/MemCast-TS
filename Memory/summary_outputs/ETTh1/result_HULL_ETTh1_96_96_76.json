  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. It initially considers advanced methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but defaults to a simple median-based heuristic due to data constraints. The solution focuses on handling daily seasonality and outlier mitigation, with careful attention to output formatting requirements.",
