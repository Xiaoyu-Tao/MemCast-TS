  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to short-term time-series forecasting with limited historical records. The analyst prioritizes robustness and simplicity due to the 4-day data constraint, focusing on daily seasonality while acknowledging the inability to capture weekly patterns. Key steps include data completeness verification, pattern recognition, method evaluation, and implementation of a simple averaging technique for forecasting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (night troughs, daytime peaks)",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Consecutive hourly intervals",
    "Limited historical data (4 days)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity when historical data is insufficient for complex models",
    "Explicit verification of data completeness before analysis",
    "Recognition of daily patterns through hour-grouped examination",
    "Acknowledgment of weekly pattern limitations with short data spans",
    "Rounding conventions matching input data precision in outputs"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough consideration of method trade-offs. The reasoning systematically evaluates advanced techniques (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) but defaults to simple averaging due to data constraints, demonstrating practical adaptation to limitations while maintaining rigorous data inspection and pattern analysis.",
