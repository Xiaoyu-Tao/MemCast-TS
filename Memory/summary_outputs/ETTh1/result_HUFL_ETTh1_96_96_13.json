  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory focuses on forecasting 96 future hourly data points using 96 historical records. Due to limited data (only 4 days), complex models like SARIMA were considered but deemed infeasible. The approach prioritizes simplicity and robustness, settling on hourly averaging to handle potential daily patterns. The reasoning includes thorough data inspection, method evaluation, and output formatting considerations.",

    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex modeling like SARIMA with daily seasonality",
    "Hourly averaging is preferred for robustness with minimal historical data",
    "Output formatting must match input precision (3 decimal places displayed as 6 digits)",
    "Trend detection is unreliable with only 4 days of data",
