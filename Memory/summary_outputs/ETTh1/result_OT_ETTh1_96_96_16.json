  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a comprehensive approach to time-series forecasting, focusing on handling potential missing values, identifying key patterns, and selecting appropriate methods for multi-step forecasting. The analyst prioritizes capturing daily seasonality and downward trends while balancing simplicity with accuracy. The approach is methodical, involving data validation, pattern recognition, method evaluation, and step-by-step implementation, though constrained by limited historical data.",
