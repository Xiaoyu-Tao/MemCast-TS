  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting with limited data. It begins by assessing data completeness and identifying seasonality and trend patterns. Due to the short time series (96 hours), complex models like SARIMA are considered but deemed impractical. Instead, a hybrid heuristic-statistical method is developed: first computing hourly averages for base seasonality, then using linear regression to model an upward trend in daily averages, and finally combining these through additive adjustments for the forecast. The approach shows strong pattern recognition but acknowledges data limitations.",
