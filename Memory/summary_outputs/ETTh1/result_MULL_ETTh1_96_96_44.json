  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points (96 hours). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality identification and rejecting complex models in favor of heuristic methods. Key steps include data completeness verification, pattern analysis, method evaluation, and practical implementation with rounding considerations.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Complete data in provided segment (no missing values)",
    "Hourly pattern consistency across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (4 days) necessitates simple methods to avoid over-parameterization of complex models",
    "Daily seasonality is the primary pattern leveraged for forecasting",
    "Averaging same-hour values across historical days provides a stable baseline forecast",
    "Forecast repetition of averaged daily pattern for multi-day horizons",
    "Explicit handling of decimal precision to match input data format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method comparison, and computational steps while maintaining practical simplicity through heuristic averaging. Avoids advanced statistical models due to data limitations.",
