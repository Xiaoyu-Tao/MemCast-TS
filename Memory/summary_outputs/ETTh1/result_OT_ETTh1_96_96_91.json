  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to hourly oil temperature forecasting using a 96-hour historical dataset. The analyst methodically evaluates advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately adopts a simple averaging technique due to computational constraints in the simulated environment. Key focuses include handling potential missing values, identifying daily seasonality, and addressing data limitations for weekly pattern detection.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete data in the provided segment",
    "Hourly fluctuations with daytime dips and nighttime rises"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary predictable pattern when weekly patterns are unattainable with limited data",
    "Simple averaging per hour across available days provides a feasible heuristic under computational constraints",
    "Data segmentation into 24-hour chunks enables efficient pattern extraction",
    "Missing value handling considerations influence model selection despite complete training data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines advanced model consideration with practical simplification. Features multi-step analysis including data inspection, seasonality identification, model comparison, and manual computation planning, but simplifies execution due to environmental constraints.",
