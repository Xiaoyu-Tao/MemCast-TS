  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and selecting a simple, seasonality-driven model. The analyst emphasizes daily seasonality detection, data completeness verification, and practical method selection (simple averaging) due to limited historical data (96 points). The process is systematic but constrained by data size, leading to a straightforward solution without complex modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Peak hours (e.g., 00:00, 06:00, 22:00-23:00)",
    "Daytime value drops",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete data (no missing values in provided set)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, dictating the forecasting approach",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models",
    "Hourly averaging smooths day-to-day variations while preserving seasonal patterns",
    "Explicit verification of data completeness before modeling",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimals to match input data precision"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with practical simplifications: Includes data inspection and method comparisons but opts for straightforward averaging due to data constraints. Involves manual hourly calculations but avoids advanced statistical models or trend adjustments.",
