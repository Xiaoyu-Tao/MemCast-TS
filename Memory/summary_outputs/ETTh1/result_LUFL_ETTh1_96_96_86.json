  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a robust approach focused on identifying seasonality and selecting a simple yet effective forecasting method. It systematically evaluates options like Seasonal Naive and averaging, ultimately choosing the latter for its stability. The analysis includes data completeness verification, pattern examination, and detailed computation of hourly averages, resulting in a well-structured forecast.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Complete data (no missing values)",
    "Stable hourly consumption patterns",
    "Repeated daily cycles in energy usage"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hourly averaging effective",
    "Averaging same-hour values across multiple days smooths noise and increases robustness compared to single-day replication",
    "Data completeness verification is prioritized before model selection",
    "Explicit trade-off analysis between Seasonal Naive and averaging methods",
    "Detailed computation of 24-hour average profile forms the forecast foundation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step heuristic analysis, including pattern identification, method comparison, and detailed hourly computations, but avoids advanced statistical models.",
