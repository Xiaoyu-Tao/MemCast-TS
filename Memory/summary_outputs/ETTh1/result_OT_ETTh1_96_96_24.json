  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on robust pattern extraction. It identifies daily seasonality and handles anomalies through median-based aggregation, prioritizing simplicity and resilience over complex modeling due to the small dataset size (96 points). The method effectively balances seasonality capture with outlier mitigation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (temperature fluctuations)",
    "Presence of anomalies/outliers",
    "Slight decreasing trend (though deemed unreliable)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Median aggregation per hour provides robustness against anomalies compared to mean-based methods",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple heuristics over complex models like ARIMA or decomposition",
    "Seasonal patterns can be extrapolated by repeating aggregated daily cycles",
    "Precision consistency (6 decimal places) is maintained for output formatting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analytical reasoning: involves data inspection, anomaly detection, method comparison, detailed median calculations, and precision handling, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
