  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) with daily seasonality by employing a simple yet effective averaging approach. The analysis demonstrated careful consideration of method limitations (SARIMA/ETS requiring more data) and opted for hourly averaging across 4 days to create a daily profile forecast. The approach prioritized robustness over complexity given data constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete data without missing values in provided history",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging compensates for limited historical data while capturing daily patterns",
    "Explicit check for trends/anomalies before selecting methodology",
    "Consideration and rejection of complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to short data length",
    "Rigorous hourly mean calculations with precision management (3 decimal rounding)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of multiple methodologies before selecting a heuristic approach. Included detailed data pattern examination and precision considerations while maintaining practical implementation focus.",
