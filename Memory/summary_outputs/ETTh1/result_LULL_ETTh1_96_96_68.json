  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data and anomalies. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality while addressing a significant anomaly in the input data. The solution prioritizes simplicity and robustness by excluding anomalous periods and using hourly averaging of valid days, then repeating the pattern for the forecast horizon.",

    "Exclusion of anomalous days (e.g., constant-value periods) to prevent skewing forecasts",
