  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly oil temperature data using a median-based heuristic method. The analyst identified daily seasonality and handled an outlier day through robust statistical aggregation, resulting in a simple yet effective solution tailored for short time-series data with clear periodic patterns.",
