  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting, starting with data inspection and method selection before settling on a heuristic solution due to computational constraints. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and anomalies, then implements a robust median-based method to handle outliers, followed by pattern repetition and output formatting.",
