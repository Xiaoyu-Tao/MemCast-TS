  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough, step-by-step analysis of a 96-hour time-series forecasting task. The modeler carefully examines data patterns, identifies daily seasonality and weekday-weekend variations, evaluates multiple forecasting approaches, and addresses challenges like negative values and limited data. The reasoning is highly detailed, methodical, and context-aware, though it shows some uncertainty in final method selection due to data constraints.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality must be modeled, but weekly patterns are unreliable with only 4 days of data",
    "Forecasts should prioritize historical weekday data when predicting weekdays",
    "Negative values prohibit multiplicative models and adjustments",
