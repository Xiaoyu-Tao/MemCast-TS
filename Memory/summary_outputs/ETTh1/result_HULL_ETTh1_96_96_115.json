  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. Initially considering advanced methods like Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA to handle daily seasonality, the analysis pivots to a simple averaging heuristic due to data constraints (only 4 days of hourly data) and the inability to run code. The solution focuses on extracting a consistent daily pattern while acknowledging limitations like potential day-of-week effects and non-stationarity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Non-stationarity (changing mean/amplitude)",
    "Peak values during daytime hours (10:00-13:00)",
    "Troughs in early morning (04:00-06:00) and evening (18:00-21:00)",
    "No missing values in historical data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality drives the core forecasting approach using hourly averaging",
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents complex modeling or weekly pattern recognition",
    "Recent day's higher peaks weighted more in initial considerations",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimals to match input precision",
    "Explicit handling of date/time alignment for forecast period"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate initial complexity (statistical model consideration) simplifying to practical heuristics due to data constraints. Features multi-step validation of patterns, decomposition logic, and data quality checks before settling on averaging.",
