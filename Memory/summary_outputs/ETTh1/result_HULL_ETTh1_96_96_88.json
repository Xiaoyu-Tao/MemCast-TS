  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It begins by evaluating advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately adopts a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The analysis thoroughly considers seasonality, trend detection, and data characteristics (negative values, no missing data) while prioritizing practicality over complexity for short forecast horizon.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Presence of negative values",
    "Complete data without missing values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex model feasibility (e.g., SARIMA parameter estimation)",
    "Negative values preclude multiplicative seasonal models",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily patterns when trends are negligible",
    "Forecast horizon matching input length justifies pattern repetition",
    "Data inspection (daily/hourly calculations) precedes method selection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Starts with advanced model evaluation but simplifies to heuristic methods after data inspection. Includes multi-step validation (trend analysis, seasonality checks) and manual calculations.",
