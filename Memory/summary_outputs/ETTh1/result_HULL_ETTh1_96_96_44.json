  "overall_summary": "The analysis demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited historical data (96 points). The reasoning combines statistical method consideration with pragmatic adaptation to data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality detection while acknowledging weekly pattern limitations. The final implementation uses simple averaging of available daily patterns due to insufficient data for complex seasonal models.",
