  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under computational constraints. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but ultimately implements a simple averaging method due to environment limitations. The approach includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and careful output formatting.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Seasonal patterns can be captured through hourly bucket averaging",
    "Recent data points may require weighted treatment for trend adjustment",
