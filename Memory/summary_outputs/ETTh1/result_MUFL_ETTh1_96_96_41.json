  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst initially considers advanced statistical models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but opts for a simple averaging method due to data limitations (only 4 days of history) and implementation constraints. The solution focuses on capturing daily patterns through hourly averaging, with thorough data validation and rounding for consistency.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No strong long-term trend",
    "Complete data (no missing values)",
    "Hourly pattern consistency across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern in hourly data, addressed through hour-of-day averaging",
    "Limited historical data (96 points) favors simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Data completeness checks are essential before forecasting",
    "Rounding outputs to match input precision maintains consistency",
    "Repeating identified daily patterns provides reliable short-term forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial statistical model evaluation with practical simplification. Features multi-step validation (data checks, pattern analysis, rounding) but ultimately implements an interpretable heuristic method.",
