  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points (96 hours). The analyst identifies daily seasonality and an anomalous day, leading to the adoption of a robust median-based heuristic method that excludes the anomaly. The approach is pragmatic given data constraints, though it sacrifices statistical sophistication for simplicity and robustness.",
