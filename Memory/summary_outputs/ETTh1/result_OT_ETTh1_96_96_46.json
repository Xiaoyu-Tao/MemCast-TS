  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It emphasizes handling daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints, ultimately selecting a simple averaging method after evaluating alternatives like SARIMA and exponential smoothing. The approach prioritizes feasibility given the text-based environment and short history.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Potential downward trend in recent data",
    "Hourly pattern variations (e.g., higher daytime values)",
    "No missing values in input data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex modeling of trends or weekly seasonality",
    "Daily patterns can be captured through hour-of-day averaging",
    "Recent anomalies (e.g., temperature drop on last day) are smoothed rather than extrapolated",
    "Forecast horizon matching historical period length enables pattern repetition",
    "Data precision consistency (6 decimal places) maintained in output"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough method evaluation, but ultimately implements simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes multi-step justification, pattern analysis, and manual calculations while avoiding computationally intensive models.",
