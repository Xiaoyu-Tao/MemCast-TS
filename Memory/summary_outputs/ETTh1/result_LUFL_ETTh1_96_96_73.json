  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analysis of a 96-hour time-series forecasting task for transformer load data. The approach focuses on identifying patterns in limited data (4 days), handling day-of-week effects, and developing a practical heuristic method when advanced models are constrained by data scarcity. The reasoning is thorough, emphasizing data completeness checks, seasonality detection, and pragmatic solutions for weekly pattern extrapolation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Weekly patterns (weekday vs. weekend differences)",

    "Outlier detection (e.g., Saturday spike)",
    "Day-of-week effects"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized daily seasonality over weekly patterns due to limited data (only 4 days)",
    "Used last observed weekend day (Saturday) as proxy for forecasting Sunday",
    "Averaged weekday patterns (Wed-Fri) for Monday-Wednesday forecasts",
    "Addressed data scarcity constraints by simplifying model complexity",
    "Validated absence of missing values in the provided 96-point window"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines statistical pattern recognition with heuristic adaptations. Includes multi-step validation (trend analysis, seasonality detection, anomaly checks) but simplifies implementation due to data limitations.",
