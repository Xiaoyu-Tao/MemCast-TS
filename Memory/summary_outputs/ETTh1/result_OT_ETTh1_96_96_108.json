  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on developing a practical forecasting solution using available hourly data while acknowledging limitations in historical data depth. The analyst prioritized handling daily seasonality through simple averaging methods due to insufficient data for complex trend analysis, ultimately implementing a baseline approach that calculates hourly averages from 4 days of historical data and repeats this pattern for the forecast period.",

    "Utilization of hourly averaging to capture daily periodicity",

    "Preference for simplicity over complex models given data constraints"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial consideration of statistical models followed by simplification to heuristic methods. The reasoning demonstrates structured analysis of seasonality and data limitations, but ultimately implements a basic pattern repetition strategy due to insufficient historical data for robust statistical modeling.",
