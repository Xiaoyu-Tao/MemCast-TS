  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality and data anomalies while navigating constraints like short history and potential missing values. After evaluating complex models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet) as infeasible due to data limitations, they default to a simple hourly averaging method. The approach emphasizes data inspection and pragmatic trade-offs over sophisticated modeling.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis (seasonality detection, model evaluation) that simplifies to basic heuristics due to data limitations. Includes multi-step data inspection, outlier consideration, and method justification, but ultimately implements elementary averaging.",
