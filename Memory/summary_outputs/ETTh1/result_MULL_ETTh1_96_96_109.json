  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, starting with complex model considerations (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but ultimately selecting a simple averaging method. The analysis shows awareness of seasonality patterns, data limitations, and practical implementation trade-offs.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (4 days) makes complex seasonal models like SARIMA or Holt-Winters challenging to implement effectively",
    "Hourly averaging provides a practical fallback when insufficient data exists for sophisticated models",
    "Data pattern inconsistency necessitates simple, repeatable forecasting approaches",
    "Precision maintenance through rounding to match original data format (3 decimal places)",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity for future timestamps"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis that simplifies to heuristic implementation. Shows multi-step evaluation of models and data patterns but defaults to straightforward averaging due to data constraints, with detailed computational steps for value derivation.",
