  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 hours of HUFL data using 96 historical points. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and an anomalous last day, considers advanced models like SARIMA and LSTM, but ultimately implements a weighted average heuristic due to data limitations. The solution prioritizes simplicity and recency weighting, with careful handling of date generation and decimal rounding.",

    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex modeling and obscures weekly patterns",
    "Recency weighting prioritizes recent observations (weights: day4=1, day3=2, day2=3, day1=4)",
