  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data. It begins with data inspection for missing values and seasonality identification, evaluates multiple modeling options (SARIMA, exponential smoothing), and ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data. The solution emphasizes practical constraints like data size and format requirements while maintaining awareness of potential missing values.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable hourly patterns with nighttime lows and daytime highs",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided set)",
    "Consistent value ranges (0.5-1.3)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly grouping and averaging as baseline for short-term forecasts with limited data",
    "Explicit handling of data constraints (4-day history insufficient for complex models)",
    "Consistent rounding to 3 decimals to match input format",
    "Repeated pattern projection for multi-day forecasts",
    "Awareness of potential missing values despite absence in current dataset"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications. Includes method evaluation and data pattern analysis, but simplifies implementation due to data limitations. Features clear step-by-step justification and computational details while avoiding over-engineering.",
