  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analysis of a 96-hour time-series forecasting task with clear daily seasonality. The approach focuses on pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and a practical averaging method due to computational constraints. The reasoning is systematic, covering data inspection, method selection, and implementation, though limited to simple heuristics given the environment restrictions.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Pattern: positive values at night/early morning, negative values during daytime, and positive again in evening",
    "Anomalies (e.g., unexpected positive values during typically negative periods)",
    "Handling of potential missing values (though none found in the sample)"

    "Identification of daily seasonality as the dominant pattern for forecasting",
    "Use of hourly averaging across multiple days to create a baseline forecast pattern",
    "Consideration of day-of-week effects despite limited data (e.g., Saturday vs. Sunday patterns)",
    "Rounding strategy to maintain consistency with input data precision",
    "Replication of the averaged daily pattern across the forecast horizons"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Detailed pattern analysis and multi-step reasoning, but constrained to simple averaging methods due to stated limitations. Includes data inspection, anomaly detection, and practical implementation considerations.",
