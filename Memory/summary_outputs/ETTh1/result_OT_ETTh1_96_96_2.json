  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting using available data constraints. It identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options (SARIMA, naive methods), and selects a simple averaging heuristic due to simulated environment limitations. The approach is methodical but constrained by the short data history, resulting in a practical though potentially oversimplified solution.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Potential upward trend in recent data",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern addressed through hourly averaging",
    "Data limitations (only 4 days) prevent complex modeling like weekly seasonality capture",
    "Trade-off between model sophistication and implementation constraints drives method selection",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for hourly forecasts",
    "Averaging same hours across multiple days as a stable pattern estimator"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex analytical reasoning with multi-step evaluation of models and data patterns, but simplified implementation due to constraints. Includes consideration of SARIMA parameters, trend analysis, and pattern recognition before settling on executable heuristics.",
