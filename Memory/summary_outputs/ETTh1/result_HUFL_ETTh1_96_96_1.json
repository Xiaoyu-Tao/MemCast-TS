  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple heuristics tailored to short data sequences. It prioritizes daily seasonality capture through hourly averaging, explicitly rejects complex models due to limited data length, and emphasizes step-by-step computation with careful handling of rounding and timestamp generation.",
