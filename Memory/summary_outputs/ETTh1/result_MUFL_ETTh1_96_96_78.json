  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analysis of a 96-point hourly time-series with strong daily seasonality. The analyst evaluates multiple forecasting methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but ultimately selects a simple averaging approach due to limited data (only 4 days), absence of clear trends, and concerns about model overfitting. The process emphasizes data pattern recognition, robustness for short series, and practical trade-offs between complexity and reliability.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Negative daytime values vs. positive night/early morning values",
    "No significant overall trend in daily averages",
    "Complete data in the training period (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA requires more seasonal cycles)",
    "Daily averages show no consistent trend (-1.9, -2.31, -0.65, -1.48), justifying a constant pattern forecast",
    "Hourly averaging captures seasonality more reliably than repeating the last day",
    "Data precision standardization (rounding to 3 decimals) for output consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed multi-step analysis with model comparisons and data diagnostics, but reverts to simple heuristics due to data constraints. Balances statistical rigor with practical implementation for short series.",
