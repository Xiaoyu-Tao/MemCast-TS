  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes handling of data anomalies (a constant-value day) and leverages observed daily seasonality while acknowledging insufficient data for weekly patterns. The solution uses heuristic day-of-week pattern matching, selectively applying the most recent normal weekday pattern for forecasted weekdays and the only available historical Saturday pattern for the forecasted Saturday.",
