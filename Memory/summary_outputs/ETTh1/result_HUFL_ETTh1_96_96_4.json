  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, evaluates multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The process emphasizes practical trade-offs between model complexity and data limitations, with thorough pattern analysis and manual computations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Hourly fluctuations with consistent daily patterns",
    "Data completeness (no missing values in provided set)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data horizons (4 days) limit complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA risks overfitting)",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hourly averaging effective",
    "Manual computation of hourly averages compensates for lack of executable code",
    "Recent fluctuations (e.g., spikes) are smoothed rather than extrapolated to avoid overfitting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex analysis with detailed model comparisons and data pattern examination, but implementation simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data constraints.",
