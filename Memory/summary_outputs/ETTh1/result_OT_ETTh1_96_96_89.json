  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed heuristic approach to time-series forecasting, focusing on identifying patterns and trends in limited data. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality and an increasing trend, then develops a custom forecasting method combining pattern averaging and trend projection. The approach is constrained by the text-based environment, leading to manual calculations and simplifications instead of formal statistical models.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Increasing trend in daily averages",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Hourly temperature fluctuations (night dips, daytime rises)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily average temperature shows an upward trend despite a dip on day 2",
    "Patterns from recent days (especially last 2 days) are most relevant for forecasting",
    "Linear trend projection based on daily averages drives future level adjustments",
    "Manual decomposition of data into night/morning/afternoon/evening segments for analysis",
    "Base pattern adjustment via additive offsets to project future values"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step heuristic analysis involving pattern averaging, trend projection, and manual data decomposition, but avoids formal statistical models due to implementation constraints.",
