  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough, methodical approach to time-series forecasting with a focus on handling anomalies and seasonality. The analyst identifies daily patterns, addresses data quality issues (missing values and anomalies), and develops a tailored solution using simple averaging with seasonal indices. The process is highly detailed, involving data inspection, pattern analysis, and step-by-step computation of seasonal components while navigating constraints like the inability to run actual models.",

    "Exclusion of anomalous data segments to preserve pattern integrity",
    "Use of partial-cycle data to compute seasonal indices (hours 0-18 from 3 days, hours 19-23 from 2 days)",
    "Base-level calculation using the last 24-hour normal cycle for forecast anchoring",
