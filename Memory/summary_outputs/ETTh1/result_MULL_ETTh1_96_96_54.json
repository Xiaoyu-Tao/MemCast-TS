  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identifies the 24-hour pattern, handles data completeness concerns, and implements a simple yet effective averaging method for short-term forecasting. The approach prioritizes interpretability and practicality given the limited historical data (96 points), with thorough validation through manual calculations and date handling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Consistent hourly behavior across days",
    "Absence of significant trend in short-term data",
    "Complete data without missing values in the provided segment"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns can be captured through hourly averaging when historical data is limited",
    "Short-term forecasts (≤4 days) may not require complex models if seasonality is dominant",
    "Data completeness must be verified before computation, even when warned about potential missing values",
    "Forecast horizons should align with identified seasonal cycles (e.g., 24-hour repeats)",
    "Precision consistency (3 decimal places) is critical for output formatting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with emphasis on data decomposition and manual validation. Involves step-by-step pattern identification, multi-day averaging calculations, datetime handling, and rounding logic, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
