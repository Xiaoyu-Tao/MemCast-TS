  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process involved analyzing a short time-series dataset (96 hourly points) to forecast the next 96 hours. Key considerations included handling potential missing values, identifying daily seasonality, and addressing limited historical data. The analysis evaluated multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet) but ultimately selected a simple hourly averaging approach due to data constraints and unclear seasonal trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Short data history (4 days)",
    "Handling of missing values (theoretical consideration)",
    "Non-repeating daily temperature patterns"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data length forced simplification (e.g., 4-day history vs. 4-day forecast)",
    "Hourly averaging prioritized over complex models due to unclear patterns",
    "Explicit comparison of model tradeoffs (SARIMA vs. ETS vs. regression)",
    "Validation of stationarity assumptions through residual analysis"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed evaluation of statistical methods, seasonal decomposition, and residual analysis, but ultimately implemented a simple heuristic approach due to data limitations.",
