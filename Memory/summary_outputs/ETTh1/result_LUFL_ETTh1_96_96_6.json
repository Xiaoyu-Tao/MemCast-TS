  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a structured approach focused on handling hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. It emphasizes simplicity and practicality given limited data constraints (only 4 days of historical data), opting for a straightforward averaging method over complex models to avoid overfitting. The analysis thoroughly addresses data completeness, potential anomalies, and temporal alignment while maintaining clarity in implementation steps.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomaly detection (e.g., unusual dips at 8-9 AM)",
    "Stable intra-day patterns with nighttime lows and afternoon/evening peaks",
    "No significant long-term trend across days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of simplicity (e.g., hourly averaging) due to limited historical records preventing complex modeling",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for forecasting periods",
    "Robustness considerations for anomalies through averaging",
    "Awareness of unaddressed weekly seasonality limitations (e.g., missing weekend data patterns)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications. Combines data inspection, model selection rationale, and detailed computational steps, but intentionally avoids advanced statistical methods due to data constraints, favoring interpretable heuristics.",
