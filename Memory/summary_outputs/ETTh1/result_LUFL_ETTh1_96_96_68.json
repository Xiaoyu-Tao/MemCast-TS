  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using simple averaging to handle daily seasonality. It effectively identifies and excludes anomalous data while acknowledging limitations like insufficient historical data for weekly patterns. The method is robust given data constraints but relies on heuristic adjustments rather than advanced statistical models.",
