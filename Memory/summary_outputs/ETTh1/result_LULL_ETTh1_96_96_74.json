  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to a short time-series forecasting task with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by identifying daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, but acknowledges data limitations prevent modeling weekly patterns or trends. The solution uses a straightforward averaging method to generate forecasts, with detailed attention to data rounding and output formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Stable hourly patterns",
    "Handling of decimal precision",
    "Absence of clear trend (due to short data)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex modeling like SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing",
    "Hourly averaging provides a stable baseline for daily patterns",
    "Data rounding requires careful handling (round half-up to 3 decimals)",
    "Forecast assumes pattern consistency despite potential weekly variations",
    "Missing values are considered but not present in this dataset"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Detailed data inspection and justification for method selection, but relies on simple heuristics (averaging) due to limited observations. Includes multi-step computational validation.",
