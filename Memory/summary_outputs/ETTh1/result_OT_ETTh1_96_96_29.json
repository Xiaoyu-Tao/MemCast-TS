  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but ultimately selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes daily seasonality capture through hourly averaging, with careful attention to data completeness, outlier impacts, and output formatting.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Potential outliers (e.g., low values on 2016-10-27)",
    "Hourly temperature fluctuations (drops at night, rises during day)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model application (SARIMA/Holt-Winters)",
    "Daily profile averaging effectively handles short-term seasonality with minimal data",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals) is essential",
    "Reshaping data into 4x24 matrix enables efficient hourly pattern extraction",
    "Recursive forecasting is avoided due to lack of future actuals"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough method evaluation: initial consideration of advanced statistical models, detailed data pattern examination, and multi-step averaging implementation, but simplified due to data limitations.",
