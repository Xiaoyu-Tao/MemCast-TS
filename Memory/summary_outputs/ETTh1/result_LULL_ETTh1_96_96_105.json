  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited historical points, focusing on robust daily seasonality capture through median-based aggregation. It balances method consideration with data constraints, opting for simplicity due to the 4-day history while systematically addressing outliers and timestamp generation.",
