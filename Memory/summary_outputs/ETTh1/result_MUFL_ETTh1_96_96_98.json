  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a moderately complex forecasting approach focused on handling anomalies and leveraging daily seasonality. The analyst identified a constant value anomaly in the last day of historical data, excluded it to avoid distortion, and constructed a daily pattern by averaging the first three days' hourly values. This pattern was repeated for the forecast horizon, with careful consideration given to data limitations and rounding conventions.",
