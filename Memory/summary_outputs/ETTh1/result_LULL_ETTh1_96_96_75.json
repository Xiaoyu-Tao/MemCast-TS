  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-horizon time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst systematically evaluates data characteristics, considers multiple modeling approaches, and selects a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality while mitigating anomalies. The process emphasizes data completeness checks, pattern recognition, and practical implementation trade-offs given the constraints of a small dataset.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Potential anomalies/outliers (e.g., low values at 13:00-15:00)",
    "Complete data in provided window (no missing values)",
    "Fluctuating patterns without clear long-term trend"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (96 points) favors simple models over complex ones like ARIMA or LSTM",
    "Averaging per hour across days smooths anomalies and captures recurring daily patterns",
    "Explicit handling of potential outliers through median consideration (though mean was ultimately used)",
    "Data formatting consistency (rounding to 3 decimals, timestamp alignment)",
    "Rejection of seasonal naive due to last-day anomalies"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method comparison, anomaly detection, and multi-step calculations, but simplifies to baseline implementation due to data limitations.",
