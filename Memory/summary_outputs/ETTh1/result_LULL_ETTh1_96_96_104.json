  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of a 96-hour time series for transformer load forecasting. The approach emphasizes identifying patterns (daily seasonality, decreasing trend), evaluating multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately selecting a decomposition-based method due to data limitations. The analysis is data-driven, with manual computations for trend projection and seasonal adjustments, while acknowledging potential limitations like negative forecast values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Decreasing linear trend",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Hourly fluctuations (higher daytime, lower nighttime values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Decomposition into trend and seasonal components for forecasting",
    "Use of daily averages and hourly deviations to model seasonality",
    "Linear trend projection based on daily mean values",
    "Preference for simpler models (over SARIMA/ETS) due to short data history (96 points)",
    "Explicit handling of potential negative forecasts through trend analysis"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis, including manual regression calculations, seasonal decomposition, and iterative pattern evaluation.",
