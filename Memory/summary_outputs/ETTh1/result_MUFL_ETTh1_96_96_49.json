  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis for forecasting hourly transformer load data with limited historical points (4 days). It systematically evaluates multiple methods, including SARIMA, exponential smoothing, and linear regression with dummy variables, before selecting a simple hourly averaging approach due to insufficient data for weekly seasonality modeling and absence of clear trends. The analysis includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and robustness considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour patterns)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Negative values during specific hours",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (96 points) prevents modeling weekly seasonality (168-hour cycles)",
    "Daily patterns show consistent peaks (nights/early mornings) and troughs (midday)",
    "Daily mean calculations reveal no significant trend across the 4-day period",
    "Hourly averaging chosen for robustness given data constraints"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: includes data validation, method comparison, pattern decomposition, statistical checks, and practical implementation considerations.",
