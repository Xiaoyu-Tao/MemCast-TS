  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting for hourly HULL data, starting with method evaluation and ending with a practical implementation. The analyst initially considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but defaults to a simple averaging heuristic due to data constraints (limited historical points, inability to run code). The solution prioritizes daily seasonality handling and data completeness while acknowledging trade-offs in trend capture.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, addressed through hourly averaging",
    "Small dataset size (96 points) limits complex model application despite identified trends",
    "Negative values necessitate avoiding multiplicative seasonality models",
    "Forecast horizon length (96 points) requires cautious extrapolation relative to historical data",
    "Rounding conventions must match original data precision (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed statistical considerations (SARIMA parameter selection, stationarity checks) that transition to simple heuristics due to implementation constraints.",
