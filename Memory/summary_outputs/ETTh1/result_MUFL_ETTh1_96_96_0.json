  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data with limited historical records (96 points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality and potential outliers, evaluates multiple methods (Seasonal Naive, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA), and selects a robust median-based heuristic to handle data irregularities. The process emphasizes practical constraints like short history length, outlier mitigation, and output formatting requirements.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of outliers (e.g., anomalous spike at hour 23)",
    "Non-constant seasonal patterns with daily variations",
    "Short historical data (4 days limiting complex modeling)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Preference for median over mean to reduce outlier impact in short time series",
    "Grouping by hour to capture daily seasonality for forecasting",
    "Repeating the same daily pattern for multi-day forecasts due to unclear trend",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data pattern analysis, method evaluation, and step-by-step computation. Balances statistical robustness (outlier-resistant medians) with practical simplicity given data limitations.",
