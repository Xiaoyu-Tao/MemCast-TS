  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging to capture daily seasonality, explicitly acknowledging data constraints that prevent more complex modeling. The solution focuses on robustness through step-by-step manual calculations and addresses potential real-world issues like missing values despite their absence in this dataset.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Potential weekday variations (not modeled due to data limitations)",
    "Consistent 3-decimal precision in input data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality capture over trend analysis with limited historical data",
    "Explicit trade-off decision: simplicity over complexity (ARIMA/Prophet rejected due to short series)",
    "Hourly averaging as a baseline method for repeating patterns",
    "Manual computation and rounding strategy to maintain data precision consistency",
    "Date-aware forecasting aligned to the temporal structure (96 hours across 4 days)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with emphasis on step-by-step calculations; balances theoretical awareness of advanced methods with pragmatic implementation of simple heuristics due to data constraints.",
