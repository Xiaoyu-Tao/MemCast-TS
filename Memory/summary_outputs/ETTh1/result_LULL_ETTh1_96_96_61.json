  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to forecasting 96 hourly data points with limited historical data (only 4 days). After evaluating and rejecting complex models like SARIMA and exponential smoothing due to insufficient data, the analyst opts for a simple averaging method. This involves computing hourly averages across available days and repeating the pattern for the forecast horizon, prioritizing robustness and simplicity while acknowledging data limitations and potential day-of-week variations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Variation across days (inconsistent peak timings/values)",
    "Handling of missing values (not present but considered)",
    "Day-of-week effects (weekday/weekend differences)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Short historical data (only 4 days) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA, exponential smoothing)",
    "Daily patterns exist but show inconsistency, necessitating aggregation via averaging",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days provides robustness for short-term forecasts",
    "Forecast repetition of the averaged daily pattern simplifies multi-day projections",
    "Day-of-week variations are acknowledged but not explicitly modeled due to data constraints"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step evaluation of data patterns, method trade-offs, and practical constraints, but final implementation uses straightforward averaging after rejecting advanced statistical models.",
