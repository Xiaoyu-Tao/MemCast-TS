  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process evaluates multiple forecasting methods but settles on a heuristic approach combining historical averaging and last-day adjustments due to limited data (96 hourly points). The analysis demonstrates systematic consideration of seasonality, trend analysis, and practical constraints, ultimately selecting a simple but interpretable model that leverages daily patterns with level adjustments.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is critical but challenging to model with only 4 days of data",
    "Adjusting historical hourly averages by the last day's deviation balances stability and recent trends",
    "Small dataset size forces simplification over complex models (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Explicit handling of data partitioning into daily/hourly components for pattern extraction"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step statistical calculations (decomposition, averaging, trend adjustments) and method comparisons, but ultimately implements a practical heuristic solution due to data limitations.",
