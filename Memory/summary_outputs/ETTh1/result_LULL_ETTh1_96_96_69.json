  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. It acknowledges data limitations (only 4 days of history) and focuses on extracting hourly patterns while explicitly rejecting complex models like SARIMA due to insufficient data. The method is heuristic-based, prioritizing computational simplicity and interpretability over statistical sophistication, with clear handling of datetime operations and data formatting requirements.",
