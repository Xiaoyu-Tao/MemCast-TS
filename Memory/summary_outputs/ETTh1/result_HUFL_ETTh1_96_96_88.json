  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short-term hourly time-series data with limited history. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, selecting a naive seasonal averaging method after considering but dismissing more complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. Key considerations include handling of potential missing values (though none were present in the training data), daily seasonality detection, and output formatting precision.",
