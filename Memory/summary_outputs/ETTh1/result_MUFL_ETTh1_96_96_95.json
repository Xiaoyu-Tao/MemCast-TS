  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach for forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies clear 24-hour patterns, checks for missing values and trends, and selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The approach prioritizes robustness and interpretability over complexity, with thorough validation of assumptions and detailed computational steps for generating forecasts.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hour-of-day averaging effective",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex modeling options",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method comparison (seasonal naive, moving average, STL), and detailed computational validation, but ultimately implements a simple heuristic method due to data constraints.",
