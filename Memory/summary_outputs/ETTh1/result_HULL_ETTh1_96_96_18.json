  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, starting with consideration of advanced models like Holt-Winters and SARIMA but ultimately defaulting to a simple averaging method due to implementation constraints. The analysis thoroughly examines daily patterns and data characteristics, though the final method prioritizes simplicity over capturing potential trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is captured through hourly averaging across multiple days",
    "Trend analysis via daily averages showed no consistent directional pattern",
    "Forecast simplification by assuming constant level and repeating averaged hourly patterns",
    "Data rounding and formatting consistency for final output",
    "Handling of small datasets (96 points) limits complex model application"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis with statistical considerations (trend/seasonality checks), but simplifies to basic averaging for implementation. Includes multi-step data decomposition reasoning while acknowledging computational constraints.",
