  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple seasonal averaging approach due to limited data (96 hourly points over 4 days). Daily seasonality is identified as the primary pattern, with no detectable trend. The method focuses on hourly averages across observed days, repeated for the forecast period, prioritizing simplicity given insufficient data for complex models like SARIMA.",
