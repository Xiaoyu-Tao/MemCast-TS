  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality patterns. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods before selecting a simple averaging technique due to data limitations, showing clear justification for method selection and careful implementation details including data rounding and date formatting.",

    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over potential trends due to limited historical data (4 days)",
