  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed heuristic approach for forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst verifies data completeness, identifies a 24-hour seasonal pattern, and considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing. Due to computational constraints, they implement a heuristic method involving hourly averaging and trend analysis. The final forecast uses average hourly patterns adjusted by projected daily trends, though trend instability leads to reliance on overall averages. The approach is thorough but constrained by limited data (only 4 days).",
