  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and handling limited data. The analyst initially considers advanced models like SARIMA but defaults to a simple averaging method due to the absence of computational tools. The solution prioritizes simplicity and completeness, generating forecasts by repeating an averaged daily pattern while acknowledging limitations like ignoring trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No explicit missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24) is the dominant pattern for hourly data",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across historical days provides a viable baseline forecast",
    "Limited data (96 points) restricts complex modeling, favoring heuristic approaches",
    "Forecasts must be complete (no missing values) regardless of input data warnings"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Starts with advanced model considerations (SARIMA) but simplifies to heuristic methods. Includes data inspection, pattern identification, and step-by-step calculations, though constrained by the no-code limitation.",
