  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a systematic approach to handling short-term hourly time-series forecasting with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical data (96 points), carefully evaluates data validity, and selects a seasonal naive method with hourly averaging as the most viable approach given data constraints. The process shows awareness of multiple methodologies but pragmatically selects implementable solutions.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Additive seasonality preferred due to negative values",
    "Hourly averaging chosen over complex models due to limited 4-day history",
    "Explicit handling of potential missing value scenarios despite complete data",
    "Day-of-week pattern consideration dismissed due to insufficient data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step validation: Includes seasonality detection, model comparison, and data integrity checks, but ultimately implements simplified averaging due to data limitations. Shows awareness of advanced methods (SARIMA, ETS) but demonstrates practical constraint management.",
