  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach focused on handling limited data (96 hourly points) and daily seasonality. It initially considers complex models like SARIMA but rejects them due to insufficient data length, opting instead for a simple median-based heuristic method. The approach prioritizes robustness to outliers while efficiently capturing the 24-hour seasonal pattern.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Presence of outliers (e.g., spikes at specific hours)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Limited data length constraints model selection"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median aggregation effectively mitigates outlier influence in seasonal patterns",
    "Data length (4 days) is insufficient for complex models like SARIMA with 24-seasonality",
    "Hourly median calculation captures core daily patterns without trend projection",
    "Robustness to data anomalies prioritized over capturing minor trends",
    "Explicit rounding to 3 decimals maintains output consistency with input data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning that evaluates advanced models but simplifies to heuristic implementation due to data constraints. Features detailed data examination and step-by-step justification while maintaining computational simplicity in the final method.",
