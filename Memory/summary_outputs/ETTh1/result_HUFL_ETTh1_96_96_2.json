  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96 hours of HUFL data using 96 historical points. It focuses on handling daily seasonality and trend with limited data, opting for an additive decomposition model (Y(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonal(t)) due to constraints. The method involves manual daily average calculations, linear trend fitting, and seasonal index derivation, prioritizing simplicity over complex models like SARIMA or Prophet given the short history.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Decomposition into trend and seasonal components using daily averages for simplicity with limited data",
    "Linear trend projection based on 4 daily averages despite non-linearity risks",
    "Seasonal indices derived from hour-specific deviations from daily means",
    "Additive model preference (over multiplicative) for combining trend and seasonality",
    "Explicit handling of data constraints (4-day history) to avoid over-parameterized models"
