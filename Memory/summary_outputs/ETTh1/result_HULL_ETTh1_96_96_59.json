  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a practical approach constrained by limited historical data (96 hourly points). While considering multiple statistical methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), the analysis ultimately adopts a simple hourly averaging strategy due to data scarcity and pattern inconsistencies. The approach prioritizes daily seasonality detection while acknowledging potential anomalies and the challenge of forecasting a full seasonal cycle (96 points) with minimal history.",
