  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting using simple heuristics. The analyst identifies daily seasonality in hourly data, acknowledges potential challenges like missing values and anomalies, and selects a straightforward averaging method due to limited historical data and computational constraints. The step-by-step process includes data inspection, pattern recognition, method selection, implementation details, and output formatting.",
