  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a hybrid approach combining weighted hourly averages with linear trend projection to address limited historical records (96 hourly points). It focuses on daily patterns while acknowledging data constraints for weekly seasonality. The method adapts to observed trends and recent spikes through weighted historical averages adjusted by projected daily levels, demonstrating pragmatic problem-solving under data limitations.",
