  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 future hourly values using time-series analysis with strong emphasis on daily seasonality detection. Initial considerations included advanced statistical methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but the final approach adopted a heuristic method of hourly averaging due to limited data size (4 days) and implementation constraints. The solution prioritized capturing daily patterns while acknowledging potential data limitations.",
