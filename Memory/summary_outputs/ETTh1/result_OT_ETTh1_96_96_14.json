  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and applying a heuristic method when computational constraints prevent complex modeling. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality and stable trends in the data, then opts for a simple averaging technique to generate forecasts. The method prioritizes interpretability and leverages observed cyclical patterns, though it lacks sophisticated trend or anomaly handling due to limited historical data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable overall level (no strong trend)",
    "Complete data (no missing values in provided period)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns with minor daily variations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Limited data size (96 points) necessitates simpler methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Rounding precision must match input data specifications (6 decimal places)",
    "Repeating averaged daily patterns is reliable when trends are stable",
    "Data grouping by hour is critical for seasonal pattern extraction"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Starts with advanced model considerations (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) but defaults to heuristic averaging due to data limitations. Includes detailed pattern analysis and manual computations while acknowledging trade-offs in model sophistication.",
