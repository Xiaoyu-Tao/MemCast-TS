  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, cautious approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst evaluates multiple methods, acknowledges data constraints, and prioritizes simplicity due to insufficient history for robust trend/seasonality modeling. The final solution uses a practical baseline method after extensive consideration of alternatives.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Hourly frequency",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) complicates trend/seasonality modeling, favoring simple methods",
    "Daily seasonality exists but shows instability across days",
    "Averaging same-hour values creates a repeatable daily profile as a baseline",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (SARIMA, Prophet) due to overfitting risks"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed multi-step analysis: evaluates 5+ models, computes hourly/daily statistics, and justifies method selection through data pattern examination and parameter constraints.",
