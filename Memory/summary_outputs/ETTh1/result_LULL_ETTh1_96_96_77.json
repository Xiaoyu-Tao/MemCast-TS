  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach for forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies the 24-hour cyclical pattern in the 96-hour historical data and selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The approach involves reshaping data into daily segments, computing hourly averages across days, and replicating this daily pattern for the forecast horizon. The reasoning is logical and data-driven, though constrained by the short history, with considerations for robustness against potential outliers.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)",
    "Hourly variability in values (e.g., higher values at certain hours)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Averaging mitigates outlier impacts compared to using a single day's pattern",
    "Replicating the averaged daily pattern is viable for short-term forecasts without strong trends",
    "Manual computation and rounding of hourly averages ensure precision in output formatting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves data reshaping, statistical averaging, outlier consideration, and manual calculations, but relies on heuristic methods rather than advanced modeling due to data limitations.",
