  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality patterns for hourly time-series forecasting. It employs simple statistical methods due to computational constraints, emphasizing data completeness checks, pattern recognition, and careful handling of decimal precision. The approach is pragmatic but limited to baseline techniques without advanced trend analysis.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Potential outliers in recent observations",
    "Stable hourly patterns across multiple days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, enabling hour-of-day averaging for forecasts",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across historical days provides a baseline forecast",
    "Rounding protocols (to 3 decimals) are rigorously applied to maintain data consistency",
    "Recent data anomalies are noted but not adjusted due to insufficient context",
    "Forecasts replicate the identified daily pattern cyclically across the horizon"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple: Relies on arithmetic operations and pattern repetition, with basic outlier checks and rounding considerations, but lacks advanced modeling or trend analysis.",
