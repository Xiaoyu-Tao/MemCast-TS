  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on daily pattern extraction due to limited historical data (4 days). It emphasizes handling data constraints through simple averaging methods while acknowledging limitations in detecting weekly seasonality or trends. The analysis shows moderate complexity with clear prioritization of implementable solutions over theoretical optimality.",
