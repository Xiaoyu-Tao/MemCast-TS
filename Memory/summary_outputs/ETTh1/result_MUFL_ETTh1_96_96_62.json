  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data using a 4-day history. The analysis identifies strong daily seasonality, evaluates multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately implements a simple averaging method due to limited historical data. The solution includes detailed pattern recognition, handling of potential missing values, and careful consideration of data quirks like negative daytime loads and weekend pattern uncertainties.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Negative load during daytime (9:00-16:00)",
    "Positive load during evening/night",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across weekdays",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures dominant daily seasonality",
    "Weekend pattern uncertainty acknowledged but unaddressed due to lack of data",
    "Precise rounding considerations (3 decimal places) for output consistency",
    "Explicit handling of negative values during rounding calculations"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern analysis, model evaluation, and detailed computational steps, though the implemented solution (hourly averaging) remains operationally simple. Includes advanced considerations like rounding rules and weekend effects despite straightforward implementation.",
