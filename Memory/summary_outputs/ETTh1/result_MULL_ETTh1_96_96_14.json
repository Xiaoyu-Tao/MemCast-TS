  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints of limited data (96 hourly points) and inability to run computational models. It systematically evaluates multiple methods before settling on a simple averaging technique, emphasizing daily seasonality capture and data completeness. The analysis is thorough in pattern identification but constrained by data scarcity.",
