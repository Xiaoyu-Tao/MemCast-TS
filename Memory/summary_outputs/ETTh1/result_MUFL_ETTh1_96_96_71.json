  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a moderately complex analytical approach focused on daily seasonality and trend detection. It combines seasonal averaging with linear trend extrapolation, emphasizing robustness for short time series (4 days) and handling negative values through additive decomposition. The analysis shows careful consideration of multiple methods before selecting a hybrid approach combining seasonal indices with projected trend levels.",
