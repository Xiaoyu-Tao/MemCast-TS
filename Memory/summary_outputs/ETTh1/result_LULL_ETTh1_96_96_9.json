  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 hourly data points using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. The analyst thoroughly examines the data for patterns and trends, acknowledges limitations of the short dataset (only 4 days), and prioritizes practicality by selecting an interpretable method. The solution focuses on generating complete output with consistent formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Multiple intraday peaks and troughs",

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts trend projection reliability",
    "Explicit handling of data completeness requirements for output generation",
    "Value rounding consistency (3 decimals) matching input data format"
