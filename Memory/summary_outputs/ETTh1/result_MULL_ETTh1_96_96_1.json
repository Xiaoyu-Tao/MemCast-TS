  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 future points using limited historical data (4 days). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, identifying daily seasonality as the dominant pattern. After evaluating and rejecting complex models (SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) for insufficient data support, they implement a simple averaging method that captures hourly patterns while smoothing noise. The solution includes thorough data validation, outlier consideration, and output formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Absence of clear trend",
    "Potential outliers (e.g., 4.193 at hour 23)",
    "No missing values in historical data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days effectively captures daily seasonality",
    "Averaging mitigates outlier impact (e.g., high value at hour 23)",
    "Explicit handling of datetime formatting and output structure",
    "Trade-off between model sophistication and data availability drives method selection"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Includes method evaluation and data pattern analysis but defaults to straightforward averaging due to data limitations. Focuses on robustness over statistical sophistication.",
