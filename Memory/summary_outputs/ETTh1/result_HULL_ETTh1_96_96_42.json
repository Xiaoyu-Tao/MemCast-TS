  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality patterns. The analyst processes 96 hours of historical data to forecast the next 96 hours, emphasizing pattern recognition, data aggregation, and practical adaptation to constraints like the inability to run code. The approach prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, using averaging techniques to handle seasonality while acknowledging data limitations like short history and potential trends.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour diurnal pattern)",
    "Fluctuations and negative values in the data",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Inconsistent daily averages (e.g., 0.4773, 0.9042, 0.4717, 0.6501)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging across days effectively captures daily seasonality for forecasting",
    "Trend analysis is considered but deemed unreliable due to limited data (only 4 days)",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input format",
    "Forecast assumes pattern repetition without adjustments for external factors or trends"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with structured data aggregation and pattern extraction, but limited by reliance on basic averaging due to data constraints and computational restrictions. Involves multi-step calculations for hourly/daily averages but avoids advanced statistical models.",
