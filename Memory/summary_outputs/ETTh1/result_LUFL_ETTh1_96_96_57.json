  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on daily seasonality and data limitations. The analysis prioritizes simple averaging of hourly patterns due to insufficient historical data (only 96 points/4 days), while acknowledging potential weekly patterns and anomalies that couldn't be properly modeled. The method selection emphasizes robustness over complexity given the constraints.",
