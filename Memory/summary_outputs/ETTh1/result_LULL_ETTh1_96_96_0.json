  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a robust approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on handling outliers and daily seasonality. It prioritizes heuristic methods over complex models due to the short 4-day history, employing median-based profiling and scaling to maintain pattern integrity while mitigating outlier effects.",
