  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and implementing a simple averaging method. The analyst systematically inspects data patterns, considers multiple modeling options, and selects a robust hourly averaging technique due to data constraints. The process includes thorough data validation, pattern recognition, and detailed computation of forecasts.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of negative values and volatility",
    "Complete data in the provided segment (no missing values)",
    "Downward trend consideration (dismissed due to volatility)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as a baseline for seasonal data with limited historical points",
    "Explicit handling of negative values through averaging to maintain forecast stability",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimal places to match original data precision",
    "Rejection of complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to insufficient data length (only 4 days)",
    "Pattern repetition for multi-day forecasting after establishing a 24-hour profile"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data inspection and method evaluation, though ultimately implementing a straightforward heuristic solution. Includes statistical considerations (trend analysis, volatility assessment) but avoids advanced modeling due to data limitations.",
