  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It starts by exploring advanced methods like SARIMA but ultimately selects simple averaging due to data constraints. The solution focuses on identifying daily seasonality, computes hourly averages from historical data, and projects this pattern forward. The approach is methodical but constrained by the 4-day dataset, leading to a heuristic solution.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Volatility in hourly patterns",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model applicability",
    "Hourly averaging as a fallback for short-term forecasting",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for forecasts",
    "Data rounding to match input precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Rejection of weekly seasonality due to insufficient historical scope"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate initial complexity with exploration of statistical models (SARIMA), but simplifies to heuristic execution. Features detailed computational steps for averaging yet remains constrained by data limitations.",
