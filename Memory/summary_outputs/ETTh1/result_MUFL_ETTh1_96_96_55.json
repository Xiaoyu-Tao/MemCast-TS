  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. It begins with data inspection and method evaluation, considers advanced models like SARIMA, but ultimately implements a simple averaging technique due to data constraints and the need for a complete forecast. The approach prioritizes robustness through outlier-aware averaging and emphasizes output formatting precision.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of anomalies/outliers (e.g., negative values)",
    "No missing values in training data",
