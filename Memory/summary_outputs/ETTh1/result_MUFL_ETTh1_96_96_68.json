  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach focused on pattern recognition and simple averaging to handle a short time-series dataset with identified anomalies. The analyst prioritizes daily seasonality detection, anomaly exclusion, and pragmatic compromises due to data limitations, resulting in a straightforward forecasting method that repeats an averaged daily profile.",

    "Exclusion of anomalous data (constant-value day) from modeling",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex heuristic analysis with clear pattern identification and anomaly handling, but relies on simple averaging due to data constraints rather than advanced statistical models.",
