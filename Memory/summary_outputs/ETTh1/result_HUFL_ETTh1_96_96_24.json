  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. The analysis is methodical, focusing on data completeness, pattern identification, and straightforward computation. While effective for the given 4-day horizon with clear daily cycles, it lacks advanced modeling techniques and trend analysis due to limited historical data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Leveraging same-hour averages across multiple days captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models",
    "Data shows no significant upward/downward trend, justifying average-based forecasting",
    "Round forecasts to 3 decimal places to match input data precision",
    "Timestamp generation requires careful sequential construction for multi-day horizons"

  "complexity_analysis": "Low complexity: Relies on basic arithmetic averaging and pattern repetition without statistical modeling, trend decomposition, or uncertainty quantification. Suitable for short-term forecasts with clear seasonal patterns but limited scalability for longer horizons.",
