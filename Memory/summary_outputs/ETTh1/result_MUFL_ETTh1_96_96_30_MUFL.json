  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step approach to forecasting 96-hour MUFL data. It identifies daily seasonality and an anomalous constant-value day, then develops a custom heuristic method combining seasonal naive and averaging techniques. The approach prioritizes practical implementation over complex models due to limited data (96 points), focusing on handling anomalies and leveraging recent patterns while accounting for day-of-week effects.",
