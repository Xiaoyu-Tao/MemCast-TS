  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed heuristic approach for multi-step time-series forecasting using limited historical data. It combines statistical analysis with practical adaptations, initially considering advanced models like SARIMA and Holt-Winters but ultimately implementing a custom solution due to computational constraints. The method focuses on decomposing daily seasonality and trend through averaging and linear regression, with multiplicative scaling for forecast generation.",
