  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step approach to forecasting hourly oil temperature data, focusing on handling short data history (96 points) and potential anomalies. The analyst evaluates multiple methods, emphasizes daily seasonality and trend analysis, and ultimately selects a simple averaging technique to balance robustness with data constraints. The process includes data validation, method comparison, and practical adjustments to avoid unrealistic projections.",
