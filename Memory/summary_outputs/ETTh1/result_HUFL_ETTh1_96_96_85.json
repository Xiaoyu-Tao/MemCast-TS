  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 future HUFL values using 96 historical hourly data points. It prioritizes handling potential missing values (though none were found), identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, and selects a simple averaging method due to data limitations. The approach is pragmatic, leveraging hourly grouping and mean calculations while acknowledging constraints like limited training data and potential trends.",
