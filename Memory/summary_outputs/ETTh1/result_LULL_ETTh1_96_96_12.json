  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, focusing on identifying patterns and seasonality. The analysis is thorough, considering multiple methods before selecting a practical solution, and includes detailed data validation, pattern recognition, and step-by-step computation.",
