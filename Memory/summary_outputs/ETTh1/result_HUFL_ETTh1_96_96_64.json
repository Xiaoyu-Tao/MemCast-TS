  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical records (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, evaluates multiple modeling approaches, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The reasoning is thorough, considering trade-offs between model complexity and data availability, with explicit validation of assumptions like trend absence and seasonality consistency.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent amplitude in seasonal variation",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided window)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity when historical data is limited (4 days)",
    "Validating seasonality consistency through range analysis of hourly values",
    "Computing daily/hourly averages to confirm trend absence",
    "Rejecting complex models (e.g., Holt-Winters) due to insufficient seasonal cycles",
    "Using cross-day hourly averaging to capture recurring patterns efficiently"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data examination: Includes statistical checks (daily mean calculations, range analysis), method comparisons, and explicit seasonality validation, but ultimately implements a simple heuristic solution due to data limitations.",
