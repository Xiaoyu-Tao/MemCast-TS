  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on identifying daily seasonality and leveraging simple averaging due to limited historical points (96 hourly values). While advanced models like SARIMA were considered, the analysis concluded that averaging same-hour values across available days provided the most stable forecast given data constraints. The process demonstrates careful pattern observation and methodological pragmatism.",
