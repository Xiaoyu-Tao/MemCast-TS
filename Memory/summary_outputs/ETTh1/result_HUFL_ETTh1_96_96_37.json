  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting using 96 hours of HUFL data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, evaluates multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately implements a simple seasonal averaging method due to limited historical points. The approach includes data inspection, pattern recognition, method selection, and detailed computation of hourly averages for forecasting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear trend in data levels",
    "Complete data in provided segment",
    "Weekend vs weekday pattern considerations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simpler models despite expertise in advanced methods",
    "Daily seasonality drives forecasting through hourly pattern averaging",
    "Missing value warnings prompt data completeness verification",
    "Rounding conventions maintained for output consistency",
    "Date sequence generation aligned with forecasting horizon"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough data examination and model comparison, but implementation simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, trend analysis, and output formatting considerations.",
