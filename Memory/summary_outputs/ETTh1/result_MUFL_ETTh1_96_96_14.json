  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and selecting appropriate methods given data constraints. The analyst recognizes strong daily seasonality but notes insufficient data for weekly patterns, leading to a practical choice of simple averaging over complex models. Key considerations include handling potential trends, day-of-week effects, and data limitations while maintaining computational simplicity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Downward trend in specific hours",
    "Day-of-week variations (e.g., Friday vs. weekend differences)",
    "No missing values in historical data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity when data is limited (4 days) to avoid overfitting complex models",
    "Explicitly addressing the trade-off between capturing trends and lacking sufficient historical cycles",
    "Grouping data by hour for averaging to preserve daily seasonality patterns",
    "Considering but rejecting day-of-week adjustments due to single instances of each weekday",
    "Rounding forecasts to match original data precision (3 decimals)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough pattern analysis and method evaluation, but ultimately employs simple heuristics due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, trend assessment, and practical implementation trade-offs.",
