  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying daily seasonality and leveraging simple averaging techniques for multi-step forecasting. It prioritizes practicality over complexity due to limited historical data (96 hourly points), explicitly dismissing advanced models like SARIMA and exponential smoothing as unsuitable for the small dataset. The analysis thoroughly addresses data completeness concerns and output formatting requirements while maintaining computational simplicity.",
