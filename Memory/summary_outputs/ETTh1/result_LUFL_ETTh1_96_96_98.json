  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a cautious approach focused on pattern recognition in sparse data with long constant periods. Analysis prioritized recent stabilization trends over potential seasonality due to insufficient historical evidence, ultimately selecting a simple heuristic method based on persistent last observed state.",

    "Recent constant values heavily influence forecasts when historical patterns are unclear",
    "Seasonality analysis requires more cycles than available in dataset",
