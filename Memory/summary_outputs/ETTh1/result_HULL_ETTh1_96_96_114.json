  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96-hour time-series data with limited historical points (4 days). The analyst prioritizes identifying patterns (daily seasonality), evaluates model feasibility (rejecting SARIMA due to data constraints), and implements a simple averaging method that leverages observed hourly patterns. The approach emphasizes practicality, data completeness verification, and transparent step-by-step computation while acknowledging limitations like unclear trends.",
