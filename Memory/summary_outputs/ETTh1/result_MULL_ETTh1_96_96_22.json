{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting a short time series with suspected daily seasonality. After considering complex models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analyst defaults to a simple averaging method due to data limitations (only 96 points). The approach prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity, explicitly acknowledging trade-offs in pattern capture while maintaining data consistency through rounding and date formatting.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short time series (4 days) limits complex model applicability despite observed seasonality",
    "Hourly averaging provides a robust baseline for repeating daily patterns in forecasts",
