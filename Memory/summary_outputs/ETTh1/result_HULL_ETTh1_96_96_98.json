  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. It identifies an unusual constant pattern in the last day of input data, treats it as a potential anomaly, and develops a tailored solution using simple averaging while excluding suspicious data. The method prioritizes interpretability and efficiency over complex statistical models.",
