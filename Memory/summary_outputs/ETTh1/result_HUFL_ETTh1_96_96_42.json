  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting with limited historical records. It focuses on identifying clear seasonal patterns, acknowledges data limitations of having only 4 days of hourly data, and selects a simple yet effective averaging technique. The method prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while addressing data consistency through rounding.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hourly aggregation effective",
    "Limited historical data (only 4 days) restricts complex modeling",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days handles seasonality efficiently",
    "Precision consistency through rounding to 3 decimal places",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (Holt-Winters, ARIMA) due to data limitations"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern examination and multi-step averaging calculations, but deliberately avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
