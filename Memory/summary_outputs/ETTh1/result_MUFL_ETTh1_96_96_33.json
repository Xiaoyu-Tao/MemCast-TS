  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying patterns and selecting a practical forecasting method given data constraints. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality but notes insufficient data for weekly patterns. After considering advanced models like Holt-Winters and STL decomposition, they opt for simple hourly averaging due to the limited 4-day history. The approach emphasizes data completeness, output formatting, and pragmatic trade-offs between complexity and data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Consideration of potential weekly patterns (dismissed due to insufficient data)",
    "Data completeness in provided history (no missing values)",
    "Explicit handling of future date generation"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality as the dominant pattern for forecasting",
    "Adaptation to data limitations (4-day history) by choosing simple averaging over complex models",
    "Meticulous output formatting requirements (96 points, 3-decimal precision, datetime structure)",
    "Explicit computation of hourly averages across all 24 time slots",
    "Repetition of the averaged pattern for multi-day forecasting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough consideration of alternatives. The reasoning evaluates advanced methods (STL, Holt-Winters) but intentionally simplifies to averaging due to data constraints. Includes detailed data validation, pattern analysis, and step-by-step computational logic, though ultimately implements a straightforward solution.",
