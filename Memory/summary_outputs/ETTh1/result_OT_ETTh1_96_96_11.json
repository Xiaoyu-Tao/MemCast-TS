  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly oil temperature data, focusing on identifying patterns in limited historical data (96 hours). The analyst prioritizes handling daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints prevent weekly pattern detection. After evaluating multiple methods, they select a simple averaging technique due to insufficient data for reliable trend modeling, emphasizing robustness over complexity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Slight downward trend",
    "Complete data in provided history (no missing values)",
    "Temperature peaks during daytime, drops at night"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern and must be prioritized in modeling",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts trend projection reliability",
    "Recent data (last 2 days) provides the most relevant signal for near-term forecasting",
    "Simple methods outperform complex models when data is scarce",
    "Hourly averaging smooths out intra-day variations while preserving cyclical patterns"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of multiple models (Seasonal Naive, Holt-Winters, linear regression) before simplifying to a robust averaging approach. Includes data inspection, pattern analysis, and method trade-off discussions, but ultimately prioritizes practicality due to data limitations.",
