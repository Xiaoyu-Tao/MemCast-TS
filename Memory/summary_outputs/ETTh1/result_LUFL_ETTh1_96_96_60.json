  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on handling daily seasonality and potential outliers in a small dataset (96 hourly points). While initially considering statistical models like SARIMA and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing, the analysis ultimately adopts a heuristic approach using hourly medians to mitigate outlier impacts. The approach emphasizes practical adaptations to data limitations while maintaining daily pattern consistency.",
