  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analysis of a short time-series dataset with 96 hourly points, focusing on handling anomalies and leveraging available patterns for forecasting. The approach prioritizes practical heuristics over complex models due to data limitations, specifically addressing a constant-value anomaly in the input data. The final method involves averaging non-anomalous weekday patterns and replicating them for future forecasts, with careful consideration of seasonality and data integrity.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Anomalous data points (e.g., constant-value days) require special handling, such as exclusion from pattern calculations",
    "Short historical data limits complex model applicability, favoring heuristic approaches",
    "Day-of-week patterns should inform forecasting, with separate treatment for weekdays and weekends",
    "Averaging available non-anomalous data provides a robust baseline for short-term forecasts",
    "Data rounding and formatting consistency is critical for output integrity"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis, including data diagnostics, anomaly handling, pattern extraction, and heuristic modeling, while balancing practical constraints of limited historical data.",
