  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to hourly time-series forecasting with limited data. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by leveraging observed daily seasonality patterns. The analysis acknowledges data constraints (only 4 days of history) and potential missing value concerns while opting for a straightforward averaging method. The solution focuses on computational feasibility and produces a complete forecast.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Combines data pattern recognition with practical implementation considerations. Balances model sophistication against data limitations, includes detailed computational steps for pattern extraction and date sequencing, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to sample size constraints.",
