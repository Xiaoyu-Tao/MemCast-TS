  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and selecting simple, interpretable methods due to data constraints. The analyst prioritizes stability over complexity, opting for averaging techniques after evaluating alternatives like seasonal naive forecasting. The process includes thorough data inspection, method comparison, and careful output formatting.",

    "Prioritizing simplicity and stability when historical data is limited (4 days)",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data-driven heuristics: involves pattern analysis, method evaluation, per-hour computations, and rounding logic, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data limitations.",
