  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on daily seasonality and data constraints. It evaluates multiple methods but selects simple averaging due to insufficient data for weekly patterns, resulting in a robust solution that prioritizes interpretability over complexity.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Inconsistent hourly patterns across days",
    "Absence of clear trend",
    "Handling of data precision (rounding to 3 decimals)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents modeling weekly seasonality, necessitating reliance on daily patterns",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days provides robustness against daily inconsistencies",
    "Explicit rounding of forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Recognition that weekend patterns cannot be captured without historical weekend data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of alternatives (Holt-Winters, seasonal naive), detailed data inspection, and manual pattern calculation, but ultimately implements a simple, explainable solution.",
