  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach combining initial consideration of statistical models (SARIMA) with a simple heuristic method. The analysis effectively identifies daily seasonality and handles data completeness, ultimately selecting a straightforward hourly averaging technique due to strong daily patterns and available data consistency.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Daily pattern repetition enables reliable hourly averaging",
