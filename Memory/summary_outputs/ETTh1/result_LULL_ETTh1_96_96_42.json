  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging method due to limited historical records. The modeler prioritizes daily seasonality detection, acknowledges data limitations, and implements a practical solution by computing hourly averages across available days. The approach is logically structured but constrained by the 4-day dataset, resulting in a straightforward forecast without trend or weekly pattern considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Intraday variations without consistent trends",
    "Data completeness verification (no missing values in provided history)",
    "Hourly pattern repetition across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents weekly seasonality modeling despite observed weekday variations",
    "Trend analysis deemed unreliable due to short history and inconsistent daily patterns",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for future timestamps",
    "Prioritization of intraday patterns over long-term trends given data constraints"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves data inspection, seasonality identification, and multi-step averaging calculations, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data limitations. Focuses on practical heuristics over theoretical complexity.",
