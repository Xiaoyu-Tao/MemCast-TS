  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 hourly values using a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days) and observed daily seasonality. Despite considering advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the approach prioritized practicality by averaging hourly values across existing days, addressing potential outliers and ensuring completeness of output as instructed.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Outlier detection (e.g., elevated values on 2017-04-13)",
    "Handling of missing values (explicitly addressed though none were present)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data quantity (4 days) constrained model selection",
    "Hourly averaging chosen to preserve daily patterns despite outlier impacts",
    "Explicit validation of datetime continuity and output formatting requirements",
    "Robustness checks through mean/median comparisons and outlier evaluation"
