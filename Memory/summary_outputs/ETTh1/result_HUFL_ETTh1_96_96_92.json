  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling daily seasonality in a small dataset (96 hourly points) using heuristic approach. After evaluating SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, a weighted average method prioritizing recent data was selected to capture hourly patterns while accounting for potential trends. The approach emphasized practicality given data constraints, with validation through backtesting.",
