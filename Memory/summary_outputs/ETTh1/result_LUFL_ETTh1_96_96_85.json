  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting for hourly LUFL data, starting with model consideration and concluding with a simple averaging method due to data limitations. The analyst identifies daily seasonality but acknowledges insufficient data for complex models, opting for a practical solution that leverages observed patterns.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Lower values at night, higher during daytime"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (only 4 days) restricts complex model feasibility (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily patterns with minimal data",
    "Weekly seasonality ignored due to insufficient historical cycles",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input format",
    "Forecast repetition assumes pattern stability across future days"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis (evaluating SARIMA/ETS), simplifying to heuristic execution. Focuses on practical implementation constraints over theoretical optimization.",
