  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on simplicity and seasonality handling for short-term forecasting. It prioritizes heuristic methods over complex models due to limited data (96 hourly points), emphasizing robustness against overfitting while efficiently capturing daily patterns. The analysis is thorough in data preparation and implementation details but acknowledges limitations in trend detection.",

    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days to handle seasonality",
    "Reshaping data into a 4x24 matrix for efficient pattern extraction",
