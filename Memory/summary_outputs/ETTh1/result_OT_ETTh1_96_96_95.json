  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 hours of oil temperature using 4 days of hourly data. The approach prioritized simplicity due to limited historical data, emphasizing daily seasonality (24-hour cycles) and recent trends. The analyst considered SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but opted for a heuristic method averaging the last two days' hourly values, repeating this pattern for the forecast horizon. The solution acknowledged data limitations and prioritized interpretability over complex modeling.",

    "Daily patterns dominated the analysis due to clear 24-hour cycles",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with initial statistical model consideration, transitioning to practical heuristics. Included multi-step pattern analysis, trend evaluation, and precision considerations, but ultimately employed a reproducible averaging method due to data constraints.",
