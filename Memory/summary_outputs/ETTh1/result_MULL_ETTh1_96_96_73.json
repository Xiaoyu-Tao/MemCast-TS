  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting 96-hour time-series data by leveraging observed daily seasonality. The analyst identifies key patterns, considers advanced models like SARIMA, but defaults to a simple averaging method due to computational constraints. The process includes thorough data inspection, handling of potential missing values, and careful rounding of results, though it acknowledges limitations in capturing trends with limited historical data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Hourly pattern variation across days",
    "Handling of missing values (considered but not present in sample)",
    "Negative value dominance during daytime hours"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary forecasting anchor, with period=24 as the dominant cycle",
    "Averaging same-hour values across multiple days provides a practical heuristic when advanced models aren't feasible",
    "Rounding precision must match input data specifications (3 decimal places)",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts trend analysis and weekly pattern detection",
    "Outlier sensitivity in small samples necessitates consideration of median alternatives"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines theoretical model awareness (SARIMA) with practical heuristics. Features multi-step data processing including pattern identification, hourly calculations, and error-aware rounding, but constrained by dataset limitations.",
