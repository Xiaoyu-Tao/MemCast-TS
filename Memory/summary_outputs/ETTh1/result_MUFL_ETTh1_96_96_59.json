  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints, starting with complex model considerations but ultimately adopting a simple averaging method due to limited historical data. The analysis thoroughly examines data patterns, seasonality, and practical implementation trade-offs, prioritizing feasibility over sophistication given the 4-day input window.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Negative value trends during daytime hours",
    "Weekly pattern considerations (insufficient data)",
    "Complete data in provided segment (no missing values)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Data length constraints (4 days) limit complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Hourly averaging as fallback for unattainable day-of-week patterns",
    "Explicit handling of decimal precision matching input data",
    "Date-time alignment for multi-day forecasting",
    "Trade-off between error accumulation and model simplicity"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis with detailed pattern examination, simplifying to heuristic implementation due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of assumptions and manual calculations.",
