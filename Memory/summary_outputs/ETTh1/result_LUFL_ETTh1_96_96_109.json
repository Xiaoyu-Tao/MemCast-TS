  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on capturing daily seasonality in hourly data. The forecaster systematically analyzes historical patterns, evaluates multiple heuristic methods, and selects a simple averaging technique due to data limitations. The approach prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while maintaining alignment with observed seasonal patterns.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (lower nighttime values, higher daytime values)",
    "Data completeness in historical records",
    "Consistent value ranges (1.8-3.4)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern requiring explicit modeling",
    "Averaging same-hour observations across days effectively captures seasonal patterns with limited data",
    "Forecast horizons matching seasonal cycles (e.g., 96 hours for 24-hour patterns) enable pattern repetition",
    "Value rounding to match input precision (3 decimals) maintains data consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed seasonal pattern analysis and manual computation, but avoids advanced statistical models due to interface constraints. Focuses on heuristic methods with clear step-by-step justification.",
