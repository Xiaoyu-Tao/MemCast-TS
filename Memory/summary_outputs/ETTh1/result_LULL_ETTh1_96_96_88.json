  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. The analyst identified clear 24-hour patterns in the data but noted a potential downward movement, ultimately prioritizing simplicity over trend modeling due to limited historical data (only 4 days) and short forecast horizon. The solution focuses on robustness through averaging while maintaining data precision through rounding.",
