  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach for short-term forecasting of hourly oil temperature data. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited data (96 points), focusing on daily seasonality while acknowledging potential complexities like missing values and trends. The method selection balances robustness with data constraints, favoring interpretable heuristics over complex models to avoid overfitting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling to prevent overfitting",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern for hourly temperature forecasting",
    "Averaging same-hour observations across days provides a robust baseline",
    "Data stationarity justifies simple methods without trend components",
