  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process combines statistical modeling considerations with practical heuristic adjustments. While initially exploring SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models, the analysis ultimately adopts a hybrid approach of hourly averaging with trend projection due to data limitations (96 points) and observed daily seasonality. The method demonstrates moderate complexity with multi-step calculations but maintains simplicity through manual pattern extraction rather than full model implementations.",
