  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on handling limited data (4 days of hourly values) with visible daily seasonality but no clear trend. It prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging across days to capture daily patterns, while acknowledging potential limitations in ignoring short-term fluctuations and possible anomalies. More complex models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) were considered but dismissed due to data constraints.",
