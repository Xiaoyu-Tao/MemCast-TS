  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 future hourly HUFL values using only 96 historical points. After evaluating and rejecting complex models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, LSTM) due to limited data and computational constraints, the model adopts a simple averaging method. This approach prioritizes capturing daily seasonality through hourly pattern repetition while acknowledging but not modeling a weak trend. The analysis includes thorough data inspection, pattern identification, and practical implementation trade-offs.",

    "Daily seasonality (diurnal pattern)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (96 points) necessitates simple models over complex ones like SARIMA or LSTM",
    "Daily seasonality (period=24) is the dominant pattern and can be captured through hourly averaging",
    "Trends are observable but too weak to model reliably given the short data history",
    "Practical constraints (e.g., exam settings) may override theoretical model preferences",
    "Data completeness checks precede modeling decisions"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step reasoning including model evaluation, pattern analysis, and data diagnostics, but simplifies to heuristic implementation due to data limitations.",
