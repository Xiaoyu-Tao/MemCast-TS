  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple yet practical approach focused on daily seasonality and averaging methods due to limited historical data (4 days). The analysis carefully checks for missing values, considers potential trends, and acknowledges the inability to capture weekly patterns with available data. The method prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by computing hourly averages across all available days and repeating this pattern for the forecast period.",
