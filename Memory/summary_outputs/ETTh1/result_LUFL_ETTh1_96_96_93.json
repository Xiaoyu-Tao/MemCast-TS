  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting hourly time-series data with strong daily seasonality using limited historical data (4 days). While considering advanced statistical models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analysis ultimately adopted a simple averaging approach due to data constraints. The method prioritized pattern repetition over trend detection, demonstrating practical adaptation to limited data availability while maintaining focus on daily cycle preservation.",
