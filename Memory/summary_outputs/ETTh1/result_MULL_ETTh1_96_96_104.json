  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on daily seasonality and data limitations. The analyst identified clear daily patterns (higher daytime loads, lower nighttime usage) but acknowledged insufficient data for weekly pattern detection. A simple averaging method was selected due to the 4-day dataset, calculating hourly averages from historical data and repeating this pattern for the forecast period while explicitly addressing potential weekend variations and data completeness.",
