  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality detection and rejecting complex models in favor of a straightforward hourly averaging method. The analysis includes thorough data validation (missing values, trend checks) and step-by-step computation of forecasts.",
