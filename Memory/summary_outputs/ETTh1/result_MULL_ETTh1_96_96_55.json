  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and handling limited data. The analyst prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging while acknowledging data limitations like short history and potential weekend pattern variations. The approach balances pattern recognition with implementable heuristics.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Hourly averaging as a robust method for short-term forecasting with limited data",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: Includes data inspection, pattern recognition, model consideration (SARIMA/ETS), trend evaluation, and practical implementation trade-offs, but ultimately selects simple heuristics due to constraints.",
