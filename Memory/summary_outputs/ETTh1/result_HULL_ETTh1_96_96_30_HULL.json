  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a moderately complex analytical approach combining pattern recognition and simple averaging to handle multiple seasonality and anomalies. The method focuses on daily patterns while acknowledging limitations from short historical data and anomalies, using cautious heuristics to compensate for missing weekly seasonality information.",
