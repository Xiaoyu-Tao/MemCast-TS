  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying patterns and selecting simple, robust methods. The analyst evaluates multiple techniques but prioritizes simplicity due to the 4-day data constraint, ultimately choosing hourly averaging over more complex models like SARIMA or trend decomposition to avoid overfitting and unrealistic projections.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24)",
    "Decreasing trend over observed days",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Hourly fluctuations with peak/off-peak patterns"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling, favoring heuristic methods",
    "Daily seasonality is critical for hourly forecasts and captured via same-hour averaging",
    "Trend projection risks unrealistic/negative forecasts with short time series",
    "Decomposition (trend + seasonality) considered but deemed unstable with minimal data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step evaluation of methods (seasonal naive, linear regression, decomposition) and detailed pattern analysis, but simplifies implementation due to data constraints.",
