  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to handle short historical data (4 days) with potential daily seasonality. It prioritizes robustness over complexity by calculating hourly averages across days and repeating this pattern for the forecast period. The approach demonstrates cautious handling of limited data and emphasizes pattern preservation over trend projection.",
