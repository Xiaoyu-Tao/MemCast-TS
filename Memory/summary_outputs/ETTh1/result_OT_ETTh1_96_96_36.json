  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns in limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes seasonality detection, handles data constraints (only 4 days of data, no missing values), and selects a simple averaging method due to the absence of clear trends. The approach is pragmatic but constrained by data limitations, leading to a heuristic solution.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, requiring hourly averaging",
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents robust trend analysis",
    "Simple average of same-hour values across days is optimal for short-term forecasts",
    "Forecast repetition of averaged daily cycles for multi-day horizons",
    "Rounding outputs to match input precision (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on pattern recognition and heuristic adaptation. Balances statistical concepts (seasonality, averaging) with practical constraints, avoiding advanced models due to data limitations.",
