  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a comprehensive approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, emphasizing the identification of daily seasonality and adaptation to data constraints. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, exponential smoothing, averaging) before selecting a simple averaging technique due to limited data size (96 points) and absence of strong trends. The reasoning includes data validation, pattern analysis, method comparison, and implementation details, reflecting strong domain knowledge balanced with practical simplicity.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Consistent hourly fluctuations (high at night, low/negative daytime)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity (hourly averaging) over complex models (SARIMA/ETS) when data is limited",
