  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting a 96-hour time series with limited data. It identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, evaluates advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The solution prioritizes robustness over complexity, focusing on capturing the diurnal cycle through hourly averaging while acknowledging limitations in trend detection.",

    "Limited data size (4 days) constrains complex model selection to prevent overfitting",
    "Dominant daily patterns can be effectively captured through hourly averaging when data is scarce",
