  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies a 24-hour pattern, verifies data completeness despite warnings about potential missing values, and selects a simple averaging method due to computational constraints. The approach involves calculating hourly averages across historical days and repeating this pattern for the forecast horizon, with careful attention to rounding and output formatting.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Pattern consistency (low nighttime values, morning/evening peaks)",
    "Complete data in the provided segment (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Seasonality is addressed by averaging corresponding hours across multiple days",
    "Data completeness must be explicitly verified even when warnings exist",
    "Forecast values require rounding to match original data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Repeating a calculated daily pattern suffices for multi-day forecasts without trend adjustments"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Involves data pattern analysis, method comparison (seasonal naive vs. averaging), and detailed calculations, but avoids advanced models due to constraints.",
