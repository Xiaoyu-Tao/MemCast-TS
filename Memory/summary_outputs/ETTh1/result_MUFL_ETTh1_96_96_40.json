  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies strong daily seasonality, handles potential missing values by treating zeros as valid low-usage observations, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes robustness over complexity, leveraging clear intra-day patterns while acknowledging limitations like insufficient data for weekly seasonality or trend analysis.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Low nighttime usage (zero values)",
    "Intra-day fluctuations",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Zeros represent valid low-usage periods rather than missing data",
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents trend detection or weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Hourly averaging is robust for short-term forecasts with strong daily patterns",
    "Forecasts reuse the same 24-hour average pattern for all future days",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Combines data inspection, pattern recognition, and heuristic modeling. Considers advanced methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but defaults to simplicity due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of assumptions and manual calculations.",
