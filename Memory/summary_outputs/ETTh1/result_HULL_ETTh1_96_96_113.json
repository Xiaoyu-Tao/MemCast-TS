{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series analysis with limited data, prioritizing simplicity and interpretability. The analyst systematically evaluates methods like SARIMA and Holt-Winters but ultimately selects a basic hourly averaging technique due to data constraints (only 4 days). The process includes thorough data inspection, method justification, and step-by-step computation, though the chosen method may oversimplify complex patterns.",

    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA/Holt-Winters)",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning: Combines statistical method evaluation with practical simplification; includes data stationarity checks, model suitability analysis, and detailed manual computations, but final implementation uses basic heuristics.",
