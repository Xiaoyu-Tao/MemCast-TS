  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a moderately complex analytical approach focused on classical decomposition for time-series forecasting. It emphasizes identifying daily seasonality and trend components while acknowledging data limitations (only 4 days of hourly data). The method combines statistical techniques with practical adjustments for short data horizons, though it reveals challenges in trend estimation due to limited observations.",
