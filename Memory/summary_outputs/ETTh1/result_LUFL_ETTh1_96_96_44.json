  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical points (96 hours), opting for a heuristic method after considering but dismissing more complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. Key considerations include data completeness, holiday effects, and stability of seasonal patterns.",

    "Leveraging the last observed day's pattern for forecasting due to data limitations",
    "Explicit consideration of holiday impacts despite insufficient validation data",
    "Rejection of complex models (e.g., ETS, SARIMA) due to small dataset size",
    "Pattern repetition as a practical solution for multi-step forecasting",
    "Validation of data completeness before model selection"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong heuristic emphasis. Combines data inspection, model consideration, and practical simplification. Avoids advanced statistical methods due to data constraints while maintaining systematic evaluation of alternatives.",
