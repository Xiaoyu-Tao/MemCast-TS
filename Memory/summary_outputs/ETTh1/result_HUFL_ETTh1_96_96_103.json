  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 hours of HUFL data using limited historical data (4 days). The analyst identifies daily seasonality and potential weekly patterns but faces constraints that preclude complex models. After evaluating SARIMA, exponential smoothing, and decomposition, they settle on a weighted averaging method with recency-based weighting. The solution prioritizes simplicity and data limitations while ensuring complete output generation.",
