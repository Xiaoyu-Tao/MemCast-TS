  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for missing values and anomalies, evaluates multiple modeling options, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes robustness over complexity given the short 4-day history.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of anomalies (e.g., temperature drop on 2017-05-02)",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Stable hourly patterns despite anomalies"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data horizons (≤4 days) limit complex model applicability",
    "Anomalies significantly impact assessment but require pragmatic handling",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Forecast replication across days simplifies output generation",
    "Data formatting consistency (6 decimal places) is critical for output"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning: Includes seasonality detection, anomaly evaluation, and method comparison, but implements a simple solution due to data limitations. Balances analytical depth with practical constraints.",
