  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and employs a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The analysis is systematic, featuring data observation, method selection, step-by-step computation, and output formatting, though it acknowledges potential limitations in handling trends.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for short historical data (4 days) by using hourly averages instead of complex models",
    "Handling seasonality through per-hour averaging across available days",
    "Rounding forecasts to match original data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Generating forecasts by replicating the averaged daily pattern for the forecast horizon"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with emphasis on data observation and step-by-step computation, but avoids advanced statistical techniques due to data limitations. Focuses on practical implementation of a heuristic method.",
