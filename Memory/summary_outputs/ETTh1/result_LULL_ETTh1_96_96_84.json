  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging to handle daily seasonality, constrained by limited historical data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex modeling due to the short horizon and absence of clear trends, while maintaining data consistency through rounding.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Leveraging hour-of-day averages to capture daily seasonality when historical data is limited",
    "Explicit exclusion of trend analysis due to insufficient data span (only 4 days)",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimal places for output consistency with input formatting",
    "Rejection of complex models (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) in favor of heuristic methods for efficiency",
    "Sequential timestamp generation for multi-day forecasting aligned with the 24-hour seasonal period"
