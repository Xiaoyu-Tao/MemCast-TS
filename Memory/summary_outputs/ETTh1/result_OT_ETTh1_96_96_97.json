  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach to forecasting hourly oil temperature data with limited historical data (96 points). The model identifies daily seasonality but notes insufficient data for weekly patterns. Due to the short history, it opts for a simple averaging method instead of complex models like SARIMA. Key steps include hourly pattern extraction, daily average analysis, and handling of data constraints, resulting in a practical but basic forecast.",
