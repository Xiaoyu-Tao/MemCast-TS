  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on daily seasonality detection and a heuristic averaging method. It acknowledges limitations like insufficient data for weekly patterns and inability to run complex models, opting for a simple but systematic solution that produces a complete forecast.",
