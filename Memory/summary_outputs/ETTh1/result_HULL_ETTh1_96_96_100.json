  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints. It begins by evaluating complex models like SARIMA but ultimately adopts a simple median-based heuristic due to limited data (only 4 days) and inconsistent patterns. The method prioritizes robustness against anomalies (e.g., negative values) while acknowledging limitations in capturing weekly seasonality.",

    "Small data size (96 points) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA requires more seasonal cycles)",
