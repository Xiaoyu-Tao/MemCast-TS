  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough, methodical approach to time-series forecasting with a strong emphasis on data quality assessment and handling of anomalies. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and potential trends while carefully addressing a 24-hour constant value pattern interpreted as missing data. The approach combines data imputation, pattern recognition, and statistical modeling, though constrained by the limited 4-day dataset which necessitates simpler methods over complex models like SARIMA.",

    "Mandatory data imputation for suspicious patterns (e.g., 24-hour constants) via same-hour averaging of adjacent days",
    "Preference for simple methods (daily pattern averaging + trend adjustment) over complex models due to limited historical data",
