  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints, focusing on identifying daily and weekly patterns. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical data (96 hourly points), explicitly considering weekday/weekend effects and selecting a tailored averaging method after evaluating alternatives like Seasonal Naive and Holt-Winters.",
