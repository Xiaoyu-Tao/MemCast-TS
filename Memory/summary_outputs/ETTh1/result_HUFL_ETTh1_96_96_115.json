  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical records. The analyst identifies daily seasonality but acknowledges data constraints (only 4 days of history), leading to the selection of a simple averaging method over complex models like ARIMA or exponential smoothing. The solution prioritizes feasibility and efficiency, generating forecasts by computing hourly averages across available days and repeating the pattern, though it explicitly ignores potential trends due to insufficient data.",

    "Daily patterns dominate forecasting decisions when hourly data exhibits clear 24-hour cycles",
