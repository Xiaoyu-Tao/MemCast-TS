  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst prioritizes identifying daily seasonality, evaluates multiple forecasting methods (Holt-Winters, SARIMA), and ultimately selects a simple averaging technique due to computational constraints and data limitations. The approach emphasizes capturing the dominant 24-hour pattern while acknowledging trade-offs like smoothing recent anomalies.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Handling of potential missing values",
    "Short-term pattern consistency",
    "Occasional spikes/outliers (e.g., hour 3 spike on 2016-08-09)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern and should drive the forecasting approach",
    "Limited data (96 points) restricts complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA, trend estimation)",
    "Simple averaging per hour effectively captures recurring daily patterns",
    "Recent anomalies may be smoothed out when using historical averages",
    "Data completeness checks are critical before model selection"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: Includes data inspection, model evaluation (Holt-Winters vs. SARIMA), seasonal decomposition concepts, and practical simplification due to constraints. Balances statistical rigor with pragmatic implementation.",
