  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a decomposition approach combining linear trend projection and daily seasonality averaging, tailored for a short 4-day hourly dataset. It focuses on handling limited data by extracting daily patterns and a gradual upward trend, using statistical methods with heuristic adjustments due to insufficient data for complex models like SARIMA.",
