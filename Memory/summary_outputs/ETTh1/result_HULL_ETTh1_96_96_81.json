  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points) and outliers. After evaluating methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the analyst implemented a robust median-based seasonal naive method. This approach prioritizes handling outliers and daily patterns while acknowledging data constraints, resulting in a simple yet effective solution that repeats a typical day pattern derived from historical medians.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (lower nighttime values, higher daytime values)",
    "Presence of outliers/spikes (e.g., 5.626 at 2017-05-22 13:00:00)",
    "Volatility in day-to-day patterns",
    "Data completeness in provided samples (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Median outperforms mean for aggregating hourly values due to outlier robustness",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) constrains complex model selection",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, enabling hour-based aggregation",
    "Forecasting can be simplified by repeating a 'typical day' derived from historical medians",
    "Explicit outlier identification influences statistical method choices"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern analysis, method evaluation, and statistical considerations (median vs. mean), with detailed implementation steps for handling seasonality and outliers, though constrained by data limitations.",
