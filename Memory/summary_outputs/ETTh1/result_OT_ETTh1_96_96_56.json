  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed decomposition-based approach for time-series forecasting, focusing on handling limited historical data (96 hourly points). It systematically identifies patterns, performs statistical analysis, and combines trend projection with seasonal adjustments to generate forecasts. The approach is thorough but constrained by the short data history, leading to pragmatic simplifications like linear trend assumptions.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Clear upward trend in daily averages",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided set)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Aggregation of hourly data to daily averages simplifies trend identification",
    "Linear regression on daily averages enables straightforward trend projection",
    "Seasonal indices derived from hourly deviations capture intra-day patterns",
    "Forecast length matching historical data requires careful extrapolation",
    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical analysis, including data aggregation, linear regression, seasonal decomposition, and component-based forecasting, but simplifies where necessary due to data limitations.",
