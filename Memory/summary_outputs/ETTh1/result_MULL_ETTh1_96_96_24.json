  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical window (96 points). The analyst prioritizes handling potential missing values (though none were present), identifies daily seasonality patterns, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach is pragmatic, focusing on interpretability and feasibility given the small dataset, with thorough validation of data characteristics before model selection.",
