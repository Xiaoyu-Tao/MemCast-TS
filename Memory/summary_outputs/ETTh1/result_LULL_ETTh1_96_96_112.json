  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach for short time-series forecasting with strong daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for a straightforward hourly averaging method over complex models due to limited historical points (96 hours). The analysis effectively identifies patterns, checks for trends/missing values, and implements careful data rounding while generating a full 96-hour forecast.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "No discernible long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)",
    "Higher daytime values, lower nighttime values"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging suffices for stable short-term forecasts with clear daily patterns",
    "Data stationarity assumed after confirming absence of trend across days",
    "Precision handling: computed averages rounded to 3 decimals to align with input format",
    "Forecast generation via pattern repetition for multi-day horizons",
    "Explicit consideration of data limitations (4 days) when selecting methodology"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple: Focuses on heuristic pattern recognition and basic arithmetic operations, avoiding complex statistical models due to data constraints. Includes systematic data validation and rounding procedures.",
