  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load (MUFL) using 4 days of historical data to predict the next 4 days. The analyst acknowledges potential data issues like missing values but confirms the provided data is complete. After evaluating methods like SARIMA and exponential smoothing, they opt for a heuristic approach due to limited data, focusing on daily seasonality and recent anomalies. The solution prioritizes simplicity and robustness, though it may not fully address trends.",

    "Hourly averaging smooths anomalies while preserving daily patterns",
    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model reliability",
