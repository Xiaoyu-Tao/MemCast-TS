  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach for short-term time-series forecasting using limited historical data. It focuses on identifying patterns like daily seasonality and potential trends, then selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The reasoning is thorough data inspection, clear method justification, and detailed implementation steps, though it acknowledges limitations like potential weekday/weekend variations and short history.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, method selection rationale, and step-by-step implementation details, but relies on heuristic averaging rather than advanced statistical models due to data limitations.",
