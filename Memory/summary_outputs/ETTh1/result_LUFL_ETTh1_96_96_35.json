  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical, heuristic-based method for time-series forecasting using limited historical data. The approach focuses on identifying daily seasonality and employs simple averaging to generate forecasts, acknowledging data limitations and potential issues like missing values. The solution is constrained by the inability to use complex models, leading to a straightforward but effective pattern-based projection.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Handling of potential missing values",
    "Pattern repetition across days",

  "key_insights": [
    "Utilization of same-hour averages across multiple days for forecasting",
    "Explicit consideration of data limitations (short history, potential missing values)",

    "Value rounding to match input data precision",
    "Verification of data completeness before processing"

  "complexity_analysis": "Mostly simple heuristics with basic arithmetic operations; minimal statistical complexity due to averaging method and absence of trend adjustment or advanced seasonality modeling.",
