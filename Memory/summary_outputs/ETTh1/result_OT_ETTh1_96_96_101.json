  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a simple yet systematic approach for short-term forecasting using limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, handles data completeness, and selects a heuristic averaging technique due to computational constraints. The method prioritizes practicality over complexity, leveraging observable patterns while acknowledging limitations in trend detection with sparse data.",
