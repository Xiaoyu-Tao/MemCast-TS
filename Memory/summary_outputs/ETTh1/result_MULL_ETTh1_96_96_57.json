  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a pragmatic approach focused on simple, interpretable methods due to limited historical data (4 days). It prioritizes handling daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints prevent complex modeling. The analysis is thorough in data inspection and method justification, though the solution relies on basic averaging as a baseline.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Inconsistent trend patterns",
    "Negative value dominance",
    "Handling of potential missing values (though none in sample)",
    "Outlier detection (e.g., hour21 fluctuation)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data horizons (≤4 days) limit complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality with minimal data",
    "Trends are unreliable with short histories and should be ignored without strong evidence",
    "Output precision must match input data formatting (3 decimal places)",
    "Repeating daily patterns is a valid baseline for multi-day forecasts"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data diagnostics (trend/pattern checks) and method comparisons before settling on a simple heuristic. Includes detailed computational steps but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations.",
