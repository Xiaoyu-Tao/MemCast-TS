  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting, focusing on handling missing values, identifying daily seasonality, and applying a heuristic averaging technique. The analyst prioritizes data preprocessing, recognizes pattern consistency, and adapts to constraints by using historical averages for imputation and forecasting, resulting in a practical solution.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Missing values must be imputed using context-aware methods (e.g., historical same-hour averages) to preserve data integrity",
    "Daily patterns dominate the series and can be captured through hourly averaging across multiple days",
    "When historical data is limited, repeating averaged daily patterns provides a reasonable forecast baseline",
    "Data preprocessing (e.g., handling zeros as missing values) is critical before forecasting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: includes data imputation, pattern recognition, and heuristic forecasting, but avoids advanced statistical models due to simulated constraints.",
