  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach for short-term forecasting with limited historical data (4 days). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints prevent weekly pattern detection. The method involves decomposing the series into daily patterns, normalizing values, and reconstructing forecasts through averaged normalized patterns scaled by an overall level estimate. The approach is pragmatic but constrained by the limited historical window.",
