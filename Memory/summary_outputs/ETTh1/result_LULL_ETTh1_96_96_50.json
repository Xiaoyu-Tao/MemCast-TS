{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, focusing on handling short historical data (96 points) and daily seasonality. The analyst evaluates multiple methods but selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints, emphasizing robustness over complexity. The process includes thorough data examination, pattern recognition, and practical implementation considerations like rounding and timestamp generation.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Peaks during daytime, lower values at night",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for short datasets (4 days) when forecasting equivalent future periods",
    "Using hour-of-day averaging to smooth daily patterns and handle noise",
    "Explicitly ignoring weekly seasonality due to lack of weekend data",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data format (3 decimal places)",
    "Repeating averaged daily patterns for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data pragmatism: combines method evaluation (SARIMA/ETS consideration) with heuristic implementation, avoiding advanced models due to data limitations while maintaining rigorous pattern analysis.",
