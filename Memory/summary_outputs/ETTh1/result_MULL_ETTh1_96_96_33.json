  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) with daily seasonality. The analysis prioritizes simplicity and robustness, explicitly avoiding complex models due to limited data length. Key steps include data completeness verification, seasonality identification, method evaluation, and implementation of a simple averaging technique to generate forecasts.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity over complexity for short data series to prevent overfitting",
    "Using same-hour averages across multiple days to capture daily seasonality",
    "Explicit rounding of forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Rejection of error-propagating methods like Seasonal Naive due to instability concerns"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on practical simplicity. Shows awareness of advanced methods (SARIMA/ETS) but deliberately selects heuristic approaches due to data constraints, followed by detailed manual calculations for robustness.",
