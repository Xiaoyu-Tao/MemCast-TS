  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to forecasting 96 future hourly data points. The analyst identifies daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and stationarity in the data, then selects a simple averaging method over complex models like SARIMA due to the short history (4 days) and absence of clear trends. The solution involves calculating hourly averages from historical data and projecting them forward, with careful attention to data formatting and rounding.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Stationarity (no clear trend)",
    "Complete data (no missing values in provided set)",
    "Presence of negative values and zeros"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized simplicity over complex models (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) due to limited data length",
    "Used hourly averaging to capture daily seasonality by aggregating same-hour values across historical days",
    "Rounded forecasted outputs to 3 decimal places to match input data precision",
    "Repeated the computed daily pattern for all forecasted days due to absence of trend",
    "Validated data completeness before processing despite general instructions about potential missing values"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Detailed initial consideration of advanced models, but ultimately implemented a straightforward heuristic approach with rigorous hourly calculations and data handling.",
