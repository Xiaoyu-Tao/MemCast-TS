  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, starting with advanced method considerations (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but defaulting to simple averaging due to implementation limitations. The analysis effectively identifies daily seasonality and potential trends but simplifies the solution by averaging hourly patterns across historical data, resulting in a straightforward forecast.",
