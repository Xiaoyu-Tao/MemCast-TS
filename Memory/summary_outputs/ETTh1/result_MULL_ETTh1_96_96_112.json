  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and selecting appropriate methods given data constraints. The analyst first examines data characteristics (completeness, seasonality, and trend), considers advanced models like SARIMA, then opts for a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (96 points). The solution emphasizes robustness, daily seasonality capture, and computational simplicity while maintaining alignment with the data's observed patterns.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Consistent hourly patterns (more negative values during daytime)",
    "Complete data with no missing values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for short datasets: Averaging same-hour values across days is optimal with limited history",
    "Explicit handling of seasonality through hourly grouping and averaging",
    "Data-driven parameter decisions: No differencing (d=0) due to absence of trend",
    "Forecast replication: Repeating averaged daily patterns for multi-day horizons"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplification. Starts with advanced model considerations (SARIMA/ETS), transitions to heuristic implementation. Includes detailed data inspection, pattern quantification, and step-by-step computation, but avoids over-engineering given data limitations.",
