  "overall_summary": "The reasoning focused on analyzing hourly time-series data with daily seasonality, employing a simple averaging method due to limited historical data. While considering models like Exponential Smoothing and SARIMA, the approach prioritized robustness and simplicity by using hourly averages to handle short observation periods and potential outliers. Weekly patterns were acknowledged but excluded due to insufficient data.",
