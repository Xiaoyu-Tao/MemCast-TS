{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of a short time-series dataset with 96 hourly records. The analyst identifies potential daily seasonality, evaluates multiple forecasting methods, and ultimately implements a weighted averaging approach due to data length constraints. The process includes data inspection, method comparison, pattern recognition, and practical implementation considerations like rounding and output formatting.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Weighted Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Varying amplitude in daily cycles",
    "Higher values during night/early morning",
    "Lower values during daytime hours",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (96 points) limits complex model application",
    "Weighted averaging prioritizes recent observations (weights: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)",
    "Pattern repetition for multi-step forecasting",
    "Rounding outputs to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity in forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: includes data exploration, method evaluation (SARIMA, decomposition, naive), weighted computation, and output validation. Balances statistical considerations with practical implementation.",
