  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process evaluates multiple forecasting methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, decomposition, and heuristic averaging) while emphasizing daily seasonality and data limitations. Despite initial considerations of complex models, the analysis prioritizes simplicity due to the small dataset (96 points) and settles on a hybrid approach combining linear trend extrapolation with seasonal averaging. The final method uses hourly averages from historical data adjusted for a downward trend observed in later days.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, but limited data prevents robust weekly pattern detection",
    "Data size constraints (96 points) favor simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Decomposition into trend and seasonal components is a recurring analytical step",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days is preferred for seasonality capture despite trend challenges"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of statistical methods, but ultimately pragmatic. Combines initial advanced model considerations (SARIMA, ETS) with executable heuristics, reflecting adaptability to data limitations.",
