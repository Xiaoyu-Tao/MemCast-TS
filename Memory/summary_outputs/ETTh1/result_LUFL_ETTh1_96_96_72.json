  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 hours of Low UseFul Load data with limited historical data (4 days). The analyst prioritizes handling daily seasonality and day-of-week variations while acknowledging data constraints. The approach is pragmatic, evaluating multiple methods before settling on a weighted averaging heuristic that emphasizes recent data. Reasoning quality is high, with thorough consideration of alternatives, data patterns, and implementation trade-offs.",

    "Heuristic Analysis": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Day-of-week variations (e.g., weekend vs. weekday differences)",
    "Higher nighttime loads on weekends",
    "Consistent weekday load patterns"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data prevents modeling weekly seasonality, necessitating reliance on daily patterns",
    "Weighted averaging of same-hour data (with linear emphasis on recent days) balances recency and historical patterns",
    "Identical daily forecast patterns are used when insufficient data exists for day-specific modeling",
    "Recent data (e.g., Tuesday) receives higher weighting than older data (e.g., Saturday) for relevance"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Integrates data decomposition, multi-method evaluation (SARIMA, exponential smoothing, naive approaches), and weighted heuristic design while addressing real-world constraints like limited data and missing value risks.",
