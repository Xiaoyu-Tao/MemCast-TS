  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach constrained by data limitations and implementation capabilities. While advanced methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were initially considered, the analysis ultimately employed a simple hourly averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days) and inability to execute code. The solution focuses on daily seasonality patterns and handles negative values appropriately, though acknowledges potential oversimplification of trends.",
