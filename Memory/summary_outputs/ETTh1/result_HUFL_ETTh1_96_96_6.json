  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach focused on identifying patterns and applying a heuristic forecasting method. It recognizes daily seasonality in the hourly data and employs a simple averaging technique to generate forecasts, prioritizing practicality given data limitations. The approach is logically structured but relies on basic assumptions without advanced modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Intra-day patterns",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Leveraging daily seasonality by averaging corresponding hours across historical days",
    "Reshaping data into a 4x24 matrix to isolate hourly patterns",
    "Handling limited data (4 days) by prioritizing simplicity over trend analysis",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern for multi-day forecasts",
    "Maintaining input data precision (6 decimal places) in output forecasts"
