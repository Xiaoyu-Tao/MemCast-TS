  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 future hourly points using 96 historical points. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by opting for a heuristic averaging technique over complex models due to short data history and computational constraints. The analysis thoroughly considers data patterns, potential missing values, and practical implementation steps while acknowledging limitations like the inability to capture trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Intraday fluctuations (highs at night, lows during day)",
    "Potential downward trend (not explicitly modeled)",
    "Handling of missing values (acknowledged but not required for this dataset)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) favors simple methods to avoid overfitting",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for near-term forecasts",
    "Trend detection is unreliable with limited data points",
    "Forecast generation via repeating averaged daily pattern ensures consistency",
    "Explicit handling of datetime sequences for output alignment"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines statistical awareness (seasonality, trend considerations) with practical heuristics. Balances advanced model considerations (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) against implementation constraints, ultimately selecting a transparent, data-appropriate solution.",
