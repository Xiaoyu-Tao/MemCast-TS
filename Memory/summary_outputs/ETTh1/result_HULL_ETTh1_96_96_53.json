  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough, step-by-step analysis focused on identifying patterns and selecting an appropriate forecasting method. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality (24-hour cycles), detects anomalies (a constant-value day), and evaluates multiple modeling approaches before settling on a robust heuristic method. The process emphasizes data inspection, handles potential outliers, and adapts to constraints like the inability to run code, resulting in a practical median-based solution.",
