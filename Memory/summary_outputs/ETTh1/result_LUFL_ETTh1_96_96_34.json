  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach combining statistical model consideration with heuristic adjustments. While SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were initially proposed, the hourly time series' daily seasonality and limited historical data (4 days) led to adopting a simple averaging method. The analyst computed hourly averages across available days and repeated this pattern for the forecast period, acknowledging this as a baseline approach given constraints.",
