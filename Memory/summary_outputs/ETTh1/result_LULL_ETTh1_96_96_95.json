  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a short historical dataset (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and employs a simple averaging method due to data limitations. The process includes data validation, method selection, outlier consideration, and output formatting, resulting in a practical solution tailored to the data constraints.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Complete data with no missing values",
    "Potential outliers in specific hours",
    "Stable value range (0.9-2.0)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model selection (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Outliers are acknowledged but mean is prioritized over median for aggregation",
    "Forecast generation through pattern replication across multiple days",
    "Data formatting consistency (rounding to 3 decimals) maintains output alignment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with clear heuristic focus: Combines data inspection, pattern recognition, and practical implementation while acknowledging limitations of statistical methods for short datasets.",
