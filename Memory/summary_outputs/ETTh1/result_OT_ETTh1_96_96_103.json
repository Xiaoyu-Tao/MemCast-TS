  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a moderately complex forecasting approach focused on handling limited historical records (96 hourly points) to predict 96 future values. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and potential anomalies but faces challenges with weekly patterns due to insufficient data. After evaluating multiple methods, they implement a simple averaging technique per hour across all available days, prioritizing robustness over complexity while addressing data irregularities.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomaly detection (e.g., temperature drop on 2017-08-19)",
    "Weekday/weekend pattern consideration",
    "Handling of potential outliers"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents reliable weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Anomalies require contextual judgment (e.g., treating extreme values as real events rather than outliers)",
    "Forecast period characteristics (weekdays) should ideally align with historical patterns",
    "Simple averaging provides stability when complex models are infeasible"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data examination: Includes seasonality analysis, anomaly assessment, method comparisons (Seasonal Naive, exponential smoothing), and manual hourly calculations, but simplifies to averaging due to data constraints.",
