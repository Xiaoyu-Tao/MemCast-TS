  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough, multi-step analytical process for time-series forecasting, focusing on identifying patterns, evaluating multiple modeling approaches, and addressing data limitations. The analyst prioritizes daily seasonality and trend detection, ultimately developing a custom hybrid method combining statistical techniques and heuristic adjustments due to the short data length (96 points). The reasoning is highly detailed, with extensive data validation and quantitative verification.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality must be explicitly modeled, typically via hourly averaging or seasonal decomposition",
    "Short data horizons limit complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA, LSTM), favoring heuristic or hybrid approaches",
    "Linear trend projection combined with seasonal adjustments effectively handles short-term forecasting",
    "Weighted averaging (prioritizing recent data) can capture emerging trends when data is limited"
