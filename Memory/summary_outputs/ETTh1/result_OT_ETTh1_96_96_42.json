  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on identifying patterns and leveraging simple heuristics. The analyst initially considers complex models like Holt-Winters but defaults to a straightforward hourly averaging method due to computational limitations. Key strengths include thorough data inspection, clear pattern recognition of daily seasonality, and systematic handling of potential data issues like missing values and outliers.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Handling of potential outliers",
    "Data completeness validation"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging values across days effectively captures daily seasonality",
    "Explicit verification for missing values before analysis",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Repetition of the same daily pattern for multi-day forecasts",
    "Recognition of computational constraints driving method selection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on pattern recognition and data validation. Balances statistical awareness (seasonality, outlier checks) with practical simplification due to implementation constraints. Features detailed step-by-step computations but avoids advanced modeling.",
