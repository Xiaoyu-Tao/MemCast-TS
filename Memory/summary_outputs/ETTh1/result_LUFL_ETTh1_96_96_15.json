  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, multi-step analysis focused on handling a time-series dataset with 96 hourly points and a clear daily seasonality pattern. The approach identifies an anomalous constant-value day, evaluates multiple forecasting methods, and selects a robust solution using averaged daily profiles from the most recent valid days. The reasoning is thorough, considering data anomalies, seasonality, and practical constraints like limited history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of recent non-anomalous data (last 2 days) over full history for forecasting",
    "Use of averaging to smooth variations and create a representative daily profile",
    "Explicit handling of anomalies through data exclusion or robust statistical methods",
    "Repeated application of derived daily patterns to cover multi-day forecasts",
