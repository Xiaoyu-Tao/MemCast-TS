  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging technique to capture daily seasonality. It emphasizes handling data constraints (limited 4-day history) by focusing on hourly patterns while acknowledging potential limitations in detecting trends or weekly seasonality. The process is thorough, covering data inspection, pattern identification, method selection, manual computation, and output formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days effectively captures daily seasonality",
    "Limited historical data (96 points) restricts complex modeling like weekly seasonality detection",
    "Output formatting consistency (6 decimal places) is critical for alignment with input data standards",
    "Equal weighting of historical days is preferred over exponential smoothing given data constraints",
    "Hourly pattern repetition for multi-day forecasts simplifies projection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed manual computations; balances statistical reasoning (seasonality handling) with practical implementation constraints. Focuses on robustness over sophistication due to limited data.",
