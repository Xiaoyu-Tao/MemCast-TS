  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data spans and missing values. The analyst prioritizes simplicity to avoid overfitting, leveraging clear daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging data limitations. Key steps include data inspection, seasonality identification, missing value imputation, and a conservative forecasting method selection.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Peak usage during evening hours (20:00-21:00)",
    "Missing values requiring imputation",
    "Potential increasing trend (deemed insignificant due to short data)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary predictable pattern for forecasting",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods to prevent overfitting",
    "Missing values require imputation using same-hour averages from available days",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days creates robust typical daily patterns",
    "Forecasts replicate the averaged daily pattern across the prediction horizon"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis involving data validation, pattern recognition, missing value handling, and model justification, but ultimately selecting simple averaging due to data constraints.",
