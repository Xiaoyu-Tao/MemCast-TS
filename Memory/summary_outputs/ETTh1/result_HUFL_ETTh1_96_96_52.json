  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by selecting a straightforward averaging method over more sophisticated models due to limited historical records (only 4 days). The analysis effectively identifies patterns but acknowledges limitations in capturing weekly seasonality or trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour diurnal pattern)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Hourly fluctuations with consistent daily peaks and troughs"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Dominant daily seasonality drives the forecasting approach",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling like weekly seasonality adjustment",
    "Averaging same-hour values across multiple days minimizes error compounding",
    "Rounding precision (3 decimals) maintained for consistency with input data",
    "Explicit consideration of day-of-week mismatches (e.g., forecasting Sunday using Saturday-influenced averages)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Evaluates advanced methods (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) but intentionally selects an interpretable heuristic. Includes multi-step validation of assumptions, detailed hourly calculations, and rounding considerations.",
