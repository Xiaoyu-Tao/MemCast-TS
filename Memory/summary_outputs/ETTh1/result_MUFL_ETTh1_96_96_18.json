  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on simplicity and robustness given limited data. It identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and selects a straightforward hourly averaging method, explicitly rejecting more complex models like SARIMA due to the small dataset size (only 4 days). The analysis thoroughly addresses data completeness, rounding conventions, and output formatting.",
