  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to multi-step forecasting for hourly time-series data with limited historical points. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates method trade-offs, and implements a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The process emphasizes data completeness checks, seasonality recognition, and practical compromises between model sophistication and data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Decreasing trend across observed days",
    "Complete data in provided window (no missing values)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns despite overall trend"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents weekly pattern detection and robust trend modeling",
    "Daily seasonality dominates pattern recognition in hourly data",
    "Simple methods preferred over complex models when historical data is scarce",
    "Explicit rounding of forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Trade-off between trend sensitivity and stability drives method selection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, pattern analysis, and method evaluation, but relies on simple heuristics due to data constraints. Includes detailed computational steps but avoids advanced statistical modeling.",
