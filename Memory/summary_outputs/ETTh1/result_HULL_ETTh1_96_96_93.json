  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analysis focuses on identifying seasonality and handling constraints, ultimately selecting a heuristic method due to data limitations. The reasoning is thorough in evaluating alternatives but opts for simplicity given the forecast horizon matching the history length.",
