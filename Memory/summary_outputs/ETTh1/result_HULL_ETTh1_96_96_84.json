  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality patterns for short-term predictions. It employs simple averaging techniques due to data limitations, explicitly avoiding complex models given the 96-hour history and forecast horizon. The method prioritizes computational simplicity while acknowledging limitations in handling potential trends or weekly patterns.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Absence of clear upward/downward trend",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Noise in hourly observations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts trend analysis and weekly pattern detection",
    "Forecasting via hourly average repetition provides a robust baseline despite data noise",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment ensures consistent future period coverage",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision maintains output consistency"

  "complexity_analysis": "Mostly simple heuristics with clear step-by-step implementation, avoiding statistical modeling due to data constraints. Focuses on efficient pattern extraction through arithmetic operations without parameter tuning.",
