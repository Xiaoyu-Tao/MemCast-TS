  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, considers multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach is practical and data-driven, though constrained by the short history and inability to capture weekly patterns. Execution includes detailed value calculations and formatting considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Negative values during daytime (10:00-15:00)",
    "Positive values at night/early morning",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized simplicity over complex models due to limited data (4 days)",
    "Used hour-of-day averaging to capture daily patterns",
    "Acknowledged inability to model weekly effects without weekend data",
    "Applied rounding to match original data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Repeated daily pattern for all forecast days as safest approach"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning with detailed pattern analysis and model comparisons, but implementation simplicity due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of assumptions and manual value calculations.",
