  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a highly detailed approach to time-series forecasting with ambiguous data quality. It focuses on handling a long stretch of zeros in historical data, interpreted as actual values rather than missing data. The method involves identifying daily seasonality, leveraging the only complete daily pattern available, and applying a custom linear scaling technique to project future values while accounting for perceived operational recovery.",
