  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analytical process focused on forecasting 96 hours of oil temperature data with limited historical data (4 days). The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple methods under data constraints, and ultimately selects a pragmatic heuristic approach. The reasoning is highly detailed, methodical, and adaptive, though constrained by the limited dataset size.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Upward trend (increasing temperatures)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Higher temperatures on the last observed day"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model robustness, favoring simpler approaches",
    "Trend adjustment is critical due to significant temperature increases on the last observed day",
    "Daily seasonality must be isolated from trend effects for accurate forecasting",
    "Linear trend extrapolation risks unrealistic values but remains practical for short-term forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: combines mathematical modeling (linear regression, Holt-Winters), data decomposition, and heuristic adjustments while continuously evaluating trade-offs between complexity and data limitations.",
