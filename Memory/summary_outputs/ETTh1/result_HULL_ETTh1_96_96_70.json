  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple yet effective approach focused on daily seasonality and data limitations. By analyzing 4 days of hourly data, the model identifies a daily pattern and uses hourly averages across the observed days to forecast future values. The approach prioritizes simplicity to avoid overfitting given the short history, resulting in a 4-day forecast that repeats the computed average daily pattern.",
