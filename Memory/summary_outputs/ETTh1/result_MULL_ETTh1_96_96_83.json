  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short time-series data with anomalies. It prioritizes robustness over complexity by using a median-based heuristic method to address daily seasonality and anomalies, explicitly avoiding advanced models like SARIMA due to limited data. The solution emphasizes anomaly detection and pragmatic pattern extraction while acknowledging limitations like missing weekend patterns.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of anomalies (constant values and zeros)",
    "Short data history (only 4 days)",
    "Weekday patterns (lack of weekend data)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Median preferred over mean for robustness against anomalous days",
    "Explicit handling of constant-value anomalies (e.g., 0.888 for 24 hours)",
    "Decomposition by hourly slots to capture daily seasonality",
    "Recognition of data limitations preventing weekly pattern analysis",
    "Replication of median hourly patterns for multi-day forecasting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data validation, anomaly handling, and pattern extraction. Avoids statistical models due to data constraints, opting for a transparent heuristic approach with clear trade-off justifications.",
