  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality, prioritizing robustness over complexity given limited historical data (4 days). While SARIMA and exponential smoothing were considered, the analysis concluded that hourly averaging across observed days was most suitable due to insufficient data for complex seasonal modeling. The approach focuses on handling potential missing values through inherent averaging stability, though none were present in the training data.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Hourly averaging chosen due to limited data preventing robust SARIMA/ETS implementation",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with initial statistical model exploration, transitioning to heuristic implementation. Features multi-step validation of data completeness, seasonality analysis, and method suitability assessment while maintaining computational simplicity.",
