  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. It identifies daily seasonality and handles limited historical data (96 hourly points) by computing hourly averages across available days, then repeating this pattern for the forecast horizon. The approach is pragmatic but acknowledges limitations like potential weekday/weekend variations and insufficient data for complex models.",

    "Prioritization of simplicity due to limited data (only 4 seasonal cycles)",
    "Grouping by hour-of-day for pattern extraction",
