  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96-hour hourly data using heuristic analysis. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, handles data limitations (short history of 4 days), and addresses outliers. The approach prioritizes robustness over complexity by selecting a median-based daily profile method after evaluating alternatives like SARIMA and trend adjustments, ultimately generating forecasts through pattern repetition.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Downward trend in daily averages",
    "Presence of outliers (e.g., last hour of Day4)",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Median-based hourly profiles provide robustness against outliers compared to mean-based approaches",
    "Short data horizons (4 days) limit complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Daily pattern repetition is effective for stable seasonal forecasts",
    "Explicit outlier handling through median calculations",
    "Data formatting consistency (rounding to 3 decimals)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step heuristic analysis. Involves data diagnostics, method evaluation, daily aggregation, outlier mitigation, and pattern projection, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
