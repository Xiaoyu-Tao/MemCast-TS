  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and handling data constraints. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness, opting for a straightforward averaging method after evaluating but dismissing more complex models due to insufficient data length. The process includes data validation, pattern recognition, and practical implementation considerations.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24) is the dominant pattern given 4 days of hourly data",
    "Weekly seasonality cannot be captured due to insufficient historical records",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across days balances robustness and data limitations",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern for future periods provides a practical forecast",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method evaluation (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and practical implementation trade-offs, but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data constraints.",
