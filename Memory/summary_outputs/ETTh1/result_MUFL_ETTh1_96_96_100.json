  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to hourly time-series forecasting with limited historical points (96 hours). The analyst identifies strong daily seasonality but faces challenges due to the short data span (4 days) and potential outliers. After evaluating methods like seasonal decomposition and exponential smoothing, they opt for a simple heuristic approach—repeating the last day's pattern—due to data constraints, while acknowledging limitations in handling trends and outliers.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Changing daily levels (non-constant baselines)",

    "Higher values during night/evening, lower daytime"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex modeling and seasonal component stability",
    "Last observed day's pattern is prioritized for forecasting under data constraints",
    "Outliers in historical data are noted but not adjusted in forecasts",
    "Forecast generation via pattern repetition without trend adjustment due to insufficient trend data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step evaluation of statistical methods, but reverts to simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes data inspection, pattern analysis, and practical trade-off decisions.",
