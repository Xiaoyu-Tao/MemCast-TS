  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, starting with advanced model considerations (SARIMA) but ultimately adopting a simple averaging method due to data limitations and computational constraints. The analysis effectively identifies daily seasonality and handles data completeness, though the short historical dataset (only 4 days) limits complex modeling. The final forecast relies on heuristic pattern repetition with careful rounding and date handling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)",
    "Hourly fluctuations with peak/off-peak variations"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, requiring hourly aggregation for forecasting",
    "Short data length (4 days) necessitates simplification from advanced models (SARIMA) to heuristic methods",
    "Averaging same-hour values across historical days creates a representative daily profile",
    "Forecast generation via repetition of the averaged daily pattern for the horizon period",
    "Explicit handling of data rounding and datetime sequencing for output consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate initial complexity with statistical model exploration, but ultimately simplified to heuristic execution due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation (trend checks, seasonality confirmation) but avoids computational implementation.",
