  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting using heuristic methods. The analyst prioritizes robustness and simplicity due to limited data (96 hourly points), identifying daily seasonality and handling anomalies through median-based aggregation. The approach focuses on data validation, pattern recognition, and straightforward implementation while explicitly considering but rejecting complex models like SARIMA due to data constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Outlier presence (notably higher values on Day 2)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Median aggregation preferred over mean to mitigate outlier influence",
    "Explicit validation of data completeness despite problem warnings about missing values",
    "Rejection of complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to short data history and parameter concerns",
    "Hourly grouping for pattern extraction and multi-day replication",
    "Precision handling through rounding to match input data format"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data diagnostics and practical heuristics. Balances statistical awareness (e.g., outlier impact, seasonality) with implementation simplicity, avoiding computationally intensive methods.",
