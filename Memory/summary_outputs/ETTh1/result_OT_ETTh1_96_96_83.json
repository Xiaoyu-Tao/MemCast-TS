  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analytical process for time-series forecasting, focusing on handling data anomalies and seasonality. It begins with data inspection, identifies potential issues like constant values and outliers, evaluates multiple modeling approaches, and ultimately selects Prophet for its robustness to missing data and seasonality handling. The reasoning shows strong problem decomposition but reveals challenges in implementing complex models under constraints.",
