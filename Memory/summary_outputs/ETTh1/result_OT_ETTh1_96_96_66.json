  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step approach to forecasting a short time series with daily seasonality. The analyst decomposes the series into trend and seasonal components, using daily averages for trend modeling via linear regression and hourly deviations for seasonality. The method prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints (only 4 days of history), avoiding complex models like SARIMA in favor of manual decomposition and projection. Calculations are explicit but incomplete for all seasonal indices.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24)",
    "Trend component (modeled linearly)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length necessitates simplified models over complex statistical approaches",
    "Daily averages effectively capture trend when data is limited",
    "Seasonal indices derived from hourly deviations automatically center to zero",
    "Linear regression on daily levels provides a scalable trend projection",
    "Manual decomposition avoids overfitting with minimal data cycles"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: involves data inspection, model evaluation, decomposition, regression fitting, seasonal index calculation, and projection. Balances statistical rigor with practical heuristics.",
