  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical records. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, leveraging observed daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints. The method focuses on pattern extraction through averaging, with thorough consideration of alternatives like SARIMA and seasonal decomposition before selecting the most feasible approach given the 4-day data limitation. The reasoning shows systematic problem-solving but remains constrained by the short history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Fluctuating values with negative observations",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in provided history"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns dominate the time-series structure, making hourly averaging effective",
    "Limited data (only 4 days) restricts complex model application despite considering SARIMA/ETS",
    "Negative values are naturally handled through arithmetic averaging without transformation",
    "Forecast horizon (96 hours) matches historical pattern length, enabling pattern repetition",
    "Data rounding (3 decimals) maintains consistency with input format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong practical constraints: Includes evaluation of advanced models (SARIMA, decomposition) but implements simple heuristics due to data limitations. Features detailed pattern extraction and multi-step validation of assumptions.",
