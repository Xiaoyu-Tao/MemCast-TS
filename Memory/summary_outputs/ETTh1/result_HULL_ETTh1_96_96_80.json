  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using limited data. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, acknowledges data limitations (only 96 hourly points), and selects a simple averaging method after considering but dismissing more complex models like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing due to insufficient data length. The solution prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while ensuring complete output as required.",
