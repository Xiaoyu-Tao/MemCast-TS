  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under computational constraints, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and using simple averaging as the primary method. The analysis acknowledges data limitations (only 4 days of history) and potential outliers but proceeds with a sophisticated model alternative due to the no-code constraint. The solution emphasizes pattern recognition and data completeness while generating a full 96-hour forecast.",
