  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, focusing on identifying patterns and selecting an appropriate method given data constraints. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality and potential weekday/weekend variations but ultimately adopts a simple averaging technique due to limited historical points (96 hours) and inability to execute complex models. The approach prioritizes practicality over sophistication, resulting in a naive but consistent forecast.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Variation between weekdays and weekends",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Higher afternoon values on specific days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, requiring period=24 in modeling",
    "Small dataset size (4 days) limits the use of complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing",
    "Averaging same-hour values across historical data provides a baseline daily pattern",
    "Rounding outputs to 3 decimal places maintains consistency with input data",
    "Recent data relevance is acknowledged but not incorporated due to method constraints"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate initial reasoning with consideration of advanced models, but simplifies to heuristic methods due to data limitations. Focuses on pattern recognition and practical implementation over statistical rigor.",
