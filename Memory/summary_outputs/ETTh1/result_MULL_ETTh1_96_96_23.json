  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 future hourly data points using a simple averaging technique due to limited historical data (4 days). The analyst identifies daily seasonality but acknowledges data constraints prevent complex modeling. The solution involves calculating hourly averages across existing days, repeating the pattern for future dates, and rounding values to match input precision, prioritizing practicality over sophisticated models.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend",

  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts model complexity and prevents weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily patterns when data is scarce",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimal places maintains consistency with input data format",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity for future point generation",
    "Trade-off between model sophistication and data limitations drives method selection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Includes initial consideration of advanced models (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) but defaults to straightforward averaging due to data constraints. Features detailed data processing steps and rounding logic.",
