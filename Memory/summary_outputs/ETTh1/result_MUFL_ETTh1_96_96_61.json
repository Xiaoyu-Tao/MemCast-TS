  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points. The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, acknowledges data limitations for weekly patterns, and systematically evaluates multiple modeling approaches before selecting a decomposition method. The reasoning is highly detailed, incorporating data inspection, alternative method consideration, and step-by-step implementation logic, though it relies heavily on manual calculations.",

    "Daily seasonality (peaks/troughs at consistent hours)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing daily over weekly seasonality due to limited data (only 4 days)",
    "Using linear detrending followed by residual averaging for seasonal indices",
    "Considering weekday/weekend pattern differences but unable to model due to data constraints",
    "Validating model simplicity against data limitations (e.g., rejecting SARIMA/Prophet)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: Combines data pattern identification, mathematical decomposition (linear regression + residual analysis), and manual computation of statistical parameters.",
