  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach for short-term forecasting using limited historical data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and stable trends, then selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach includes thorough data validation, pattern analysis, and step-by-step computation, resulting in a clear hourly forecast.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable level (no significant trend)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "Negative values during specific hours"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern requiring explicit modeling",
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simpler methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures recurring patterns when trends are stable",
    "Data completeness checks precede modeling decisions",
    "Rounding and formatting consistency is critical for output alignment"
