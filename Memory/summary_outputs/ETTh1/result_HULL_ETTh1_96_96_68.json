  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies key patterns, handles anomalies (a full day of zeros), and selects a simple yet effective averaging method due to data constraints. The process emphasizes practical trade-offs between model complexity and data availability, resulting in a seasonality-based forecast with clear computational steps.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous data points (e.g., full zero day) improves forecast accuracy",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex modeling like weekly seasonality capture",
    "Hourly averaging of non-anomalous days provides a practical baseline for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit pattern replication for multi-day horizons when trend is absent",
    "Consistent rounding and formatting for output integrity"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on pattern analysis and anomaly handling. Balances statistical considerations (seasonality decomposition, model selection) with practical heuristics due to data limitations. Includes detailed numerical validation but avoids advanced modeling.",
