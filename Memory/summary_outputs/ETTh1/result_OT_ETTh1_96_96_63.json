  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough but pragmatic approach to forecasting, starting with data inspection and method evaluation before converging on a simple heuristic. The analyst identifies key patterns like daily seasonality and a significant anomaly on the last day, explores complex methods like SARIMA and linear decomposition, but ultimately prioritizes simplicity due to data limitations (only 4 days of history). The final approach uses a naive repetition of the last day's values, acknowledging uncertainty around the anomaly.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (4 days) severely limits complex model applicability, especially for daily seasonality",
    "Anomalies (e.g., last-day temperature drop) complicate trend estimation and seasonal decomposition",
    "Heuristic methods become preferable when data constraints undermine statistical approaches",
    "Linear trend estimation requires careful anomaly handling",
    "Timestamp generation is critical for multi-step forecasting alignment"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed multi-step analysis exploring statistical rigor, but reverts to simple heuristics due to data limitations and anomaly uncertainty.",
