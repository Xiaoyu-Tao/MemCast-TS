  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting for hourly HUFL data, focusing on handling short data spans and potential seasonality. The analyst evaluates multiple methods but settles on a simple averaging technique due to computational constraints and data limitations. The process is thorough in pattern recognition and method justification, though constrained by the absence of actual model execution, leading to a practical heuristic solution.",

    "Prioritization of recent data (last two days) for forecasting to capture emerging trends",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: involves seasonality detection, trend assessment, method comparison, and manual computations, but ultimately simplifies to heuristic averaging due to constraints.",
