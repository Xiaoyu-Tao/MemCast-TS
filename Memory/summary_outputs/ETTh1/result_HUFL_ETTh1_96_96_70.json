  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to a short time-series forecasting problem with limited data. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods, ultimately selecting a simple averaging technique due to data constraints and unclear trends. Key steps include data inspection, pattern identification, method comparison, and detailed manual calculations with careful rounding.",
