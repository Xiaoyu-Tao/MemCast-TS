  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging methods to capture daily seasonality. The analyst identifies key patterns, computes hourly averages across available days, and projects them forward while addressing data rounding. The approach is straightforward but effective for short-term forecasts with clear cyclical patterns.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (lower temperatures at night, higher during day)",
    "Weak non-linear trend (initial dip followed by rise)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern and forms the basis for forecasting",
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts trend modeling, favoring simple averaging over complex methods",
    "Hourly averaging across historical days provides stability in forecasts",
    "Rounding precision must match input data specifications (6 decimal places)",
    "Recent data points may be weighted differently when trends are unclear"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with emphasis on pattern recognition and arithmetic computations, avoiding advanced statistical models due to data limitations.",
