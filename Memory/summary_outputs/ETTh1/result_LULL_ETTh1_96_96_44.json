  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a heuristic-driven approach focused on daily seasonality and weekday/weekend pattern differentiation. Limited historical data (4 days) necessitated simple averaging strategies and reuse of weekend patterns. The analysis shows practical adaptation to data constraints through day-type categorization but lacks advanced statistical modeling.",
