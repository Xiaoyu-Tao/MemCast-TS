  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to multi-step time-series forecasting using limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness by selecting a daily average method after evaluating alternatives like seasonal naive, ETS, and SARIMA. Key considerations include handling short data history, identifying daily seasonality, and addressing potential anomalies while maintaining output precision.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Peak values during daytime hours",
    "Lower values at night",
    "Potential anomalies (e.g., end-of-day drops)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data history (4 days) prevents weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Averaging method chosen for robustness against anomalies",
    "Explicit handling of data precision (rounding to 3 decimal places)",
    "Trade-off analysis between model complexity and overfitting risk",
    "Grouping by hour-of-day to capture daily patterns"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step validation: Includes data pattern analysis, method comparison (seasonal naive vs. averaging vs. statistical models), anomaly evaluation, and detailed computational steps for hourly averages. Balances statistical awareness with practical implementation constraints.",
