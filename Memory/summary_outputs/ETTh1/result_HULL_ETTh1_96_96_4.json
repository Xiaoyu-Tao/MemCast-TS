  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using limited historical data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by leveraging observed daily seasonality patterns while explicitly addressing data completeness requirements. The solution focuses on capturing fundamental cyclical behavior through straightforward aggregation, avoiding complex models due to data constraints.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable hourly patterns across days",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided points)",
    "Absence of significant trend (due to short history)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Dominant daily patterns can be effectively captured through hour-of-day averaging with minimal historical data",
    "Data limitations (4 days) preclude reliable trend detection or complex model fitting",
    "Output completeness requirements override potential missing value concerns in forecasts",
    "Rounding conventions must match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Date-time formatting consistency is critical for output validation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple: Focuses on intuitive pattern recognition and basic arithmetic operations, with explicit consideration but rejection of advanced models (e.g., Holt-Winters) due to data limitations. Includes thorough implementation planning for data formatting.",
