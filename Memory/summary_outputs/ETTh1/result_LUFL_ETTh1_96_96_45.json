  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with identified anomalies. The analyst prioritizes handling suspicious constant values (potential holiday effects/missing data), recognizes daily seasonality, and evaluates multiple forecasting strategies before settling on a simple averaging method due to data limitations. The process shows careful consideration of real-world context (holidays) but is constrained by insufficient historical data for weekly patterns.",
