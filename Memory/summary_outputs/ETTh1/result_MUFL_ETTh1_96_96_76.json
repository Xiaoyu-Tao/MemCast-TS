  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short time-series forecasting with clear daily seasonality. It emphasizes simplicity due to data limitations (only 96 points), opting for hourly averaging over complex models. The analysis includes thorough data inspection, method evaluation, and detailed computation, with careful handling of rounding precision.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Instability in daily patterns",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging across days effectively captures daily seasonality despite pattern instability",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimal places maintains consistency with input data precision",
    "Explicit handling of negative values during averaging and rounding calculations"
