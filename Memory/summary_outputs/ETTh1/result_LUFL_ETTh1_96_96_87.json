  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a robust approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identified the 24-hour periodicity, confirmed data completeness, evaluated multiple modeling options (SARIMA, ETS, TBATS), and ultimately selected a simple averaging method due to the short historical data (96 points). The solution prioritizes interpretability and computational efficiency while effectively capturing recurring daily patterns.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24)",
    "Peak-trough cycles (daytime peaks, nighttime lows)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Minimal long-term trend over 4-day window"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short historical data limits complex model applicability, favoring simpler methods",
    "Seasonal component averaging effectively captures recurring patterns when forecast horizon matches period multiples",
    "Data stationarity (no significant trend) justifies pattern repetition without adjustment",
    "Explicit handling of forecasts to 3 decimal places maintains input precision"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines statistical model consideration with practical heuristics. Includes data decomposition, method comparison, and manual pattern extraction, but simplifies implementation through averaging due to data constraints.",
