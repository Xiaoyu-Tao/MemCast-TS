  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting using simple statistical methods. The analyst identified daily seasonality, verified data completeness, and selected a practical averaging technique suitable for manual computation. The method prioritizes robustness and simplicity, with thorough attention to data formatting and rounding for consistency.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly data patterns with consistent intra-day fluctuations",
    "Complete historical data without missing values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality as the dominant pattern requiring hourly-level averaging",
    "Use of multi-day historical averages to smooth noise and capture recurring patterns",
    "Explicit handling of datetime formatting and value rounding for output consistency",
    "Consideration of alternative methods (e.g., seasonal naive) before selecting averaging",
    "Validation of data completeness before model application"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with emphasis on practical implementation. Relies on basic arithmetic calculations and pattern repetition, but includes multi-step validation, method comparison, and datetime handling. Avoids complex statistical models due to text-based constraints.",
