  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints, focusing on a 96-hour HUFL dataset. The analyst identifies daily seasonality but faces challenges with the limited 4-day history, leading to the rejection of complex models like SARIMA due to overfitting risks. Instead, a simple hourly averaging method is employed, computing 24-hour profiles from historical data and repeating them for the forecast horizon. The approach prioritizes robustness over trend adjustment despite observing a potential downward trend in the last day's data.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts the use of complex seasonal methods like SARIMA due to overfitting concerns.",
    "Hourly averaging captures daily patterns effectively when historical data is insufficient for trend modeling.",
    "Ignoring observed trends (e.g., last day's drop) may be necessary when data is inadequate for reliable trend projection.",
    "Forecast generation involves repeating computed hourly profiles across the entire horizon without level adjustments."

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial consideration of advanced models with practical simplification. Includes data decomposition (daily/hourly means), model trade-off analysis, and manual computation of averages, but ultimately implements a straightforward heuristic solution.",
