  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. It identifies key patterns in the data, evaluates multiple forecasting methods, and selects a simple averaging technique due to limited historical data. The approach focuses on leveraging observed daily cycles while acknowledging data constraints and trade-offs between simplicity and model sophistication.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Higher values during night/early morning",
    "Lower values during daytime",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided series)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant and most reliable pattern for forecasting with limited data",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across historical days provides a practical baseline for short-term forecasts",
    "Complex models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) are impractical with only 4 days of historical data",
    "Trend analysis is limited by the short observation period",
    "Forecast horizon (96 hours) matches the seasonality period, enabling pattern repetition"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition with method evaluation, includes detailed numerical computations, and justifies trade-offs between sophistication and data limitations, though ultimately implements a straightforward solution.",
