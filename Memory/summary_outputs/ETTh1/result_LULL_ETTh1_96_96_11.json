  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96 hourly data points using simple averaging due to limited historical data (4 days). The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the primary pattern but notes inconsistencies across days. The method prioritizes practicality over complexity, resulting in a straightforward hourly profile forecast with careful data rounding.",
