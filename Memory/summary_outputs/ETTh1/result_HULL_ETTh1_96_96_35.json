  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality but rejects complex models like SARIMA due to insufficient data (only 4 days). Instead, a simple averaging method is employed: hourly values are averaged across historical days and repeated for the forecast horizon. The approach prioritizes robustness and simplicity while acknowledging data constraints.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model applicability",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily patterns when trend is absent",
