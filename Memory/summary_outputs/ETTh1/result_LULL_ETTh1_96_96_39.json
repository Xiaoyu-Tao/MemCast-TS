  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a heuristic approach to time-series forecasting under significant data limitations, focusing on handling a large gap of missing values (treated as an outage) and leveraging the only complete daily pattern. The method relies on pattern replication with scaling adjustments based on recent non-zero data points, resulting in a practical but assumption-dependent solution.",
