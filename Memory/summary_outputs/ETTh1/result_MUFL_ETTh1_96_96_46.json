  "overall_summary": "The reasoning focuses on handling hourly time-series data with daily seasonality using simple averaging due to limited historical data (4 days). The approach prioritizes practicality over complex models, emphasizing missing value awareness and daily pattern extraction. While SARIMA and exponential smoothing were considered, the solution adopted a heuristic method suitable for short-term forecasting with clear but variable daily cycles.",
