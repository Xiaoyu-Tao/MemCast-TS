  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 future hourly data points by identifying daily seasonality and handling data constraints. The analyst checked for missing values, confirmed data completeness, and evaluated multiple methods before selecting a simple averaging approach due to limited historical data (4 days). The final method involved computing hourly averages across observed days and repeating this pattern for the forecast horizon, acknowledging potential inaccuracies from weekend effects but prioritizing practicality.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized daily pattern repetition over complex models due to limited historical data",
    "Addressed potential weekend effects through explicit acknowledgment of data limitations",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step validation (data completeness checks, pattern consistency analysis) and statistical computations (hourly averaging), but ultimately relied on heuristic pattern repetition due to insufficient data for advanced modeling.",
