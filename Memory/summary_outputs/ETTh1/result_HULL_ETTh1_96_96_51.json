  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity by leveraging observed daily seasonality while acknowledging data constraints prevent complex modeling. The method focuses on pattern extraction through hourly averaging, explicitly avoiding trend projection due to insufficient history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model applicability (ARIMA/ETS/Prophet)",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily patterns when weekly seasonality can't be modeled",
    "Explicit trade-off between trend projection and reliability due to data limitations",
    "Data rounding and formatting consistency as critical output requirements"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial consideration of advanced methods with pragmatic simplification. Features multi-step data analysis (pattern identification, hourly aggregation, rounding logic) but avoids statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
