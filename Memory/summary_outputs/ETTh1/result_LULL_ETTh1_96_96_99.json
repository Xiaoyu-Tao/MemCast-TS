  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling limited data (96 hourly points) with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for a heuristic method over complex models due to data constraints. Key strengths include explicit seasonality identification, data completeness checks, and manual validation of assumptions, though the approach shows limited trend consideration.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity when data is limited (4 days) over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Explicit handling of daily seasonality through hourly averaging",

    "Rounding strategy alignment with original data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Forecast generation via cyclical repetition of identified daily patterns"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with strong heuristic focus. Involves data inspection, manual calculations, and pattern replication, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations. Complexity arises from detailed hourly computations rather than model sophistication.",
