  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to handle a short time-series dataset with evident daily seasonality but insufficient data for weekly pattern analysis. The approach focuses on practical implementation by computing hourly averages across available days and repeating this pattern for the forecast period, balancing simplicity with the constraints of limited historical data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

    "Reliance on daily pattern averaging when longer-term seasonality cannot be captured",
