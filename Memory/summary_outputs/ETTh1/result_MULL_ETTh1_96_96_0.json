  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short-term hourly data with clear daily seasonality but limited historical context. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to the 4-day data constraint, opting for a heuristic method that averages recent daily patterns. Key considerations include identifying seasonality, checking data completeness, and addressing potential trends while acknowledging limitations of the small dataset.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Preference for recent data (last 2 days) over full history to capture current levels",
    "Trade-off between model complexity and data limitations leads to simple averaging",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Detailed pattern analysis and method comparisons are performed, but final implementation uses straightforward averaging due to data constraints and forecasting requirements.",
