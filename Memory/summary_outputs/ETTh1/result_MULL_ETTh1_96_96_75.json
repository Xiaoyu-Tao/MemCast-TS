  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling a short time series (4 days) with potential daily seasonality. The analyst considered complex models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately used a simple hourly averaging method due to data limitations. The approach explicitly addressed weekday/weekend variations and emphasized practicality over theoretical complexity given the constrained historical data.",

    "Limited data size forced reliance on simple methods despite awareness of more sophisticated alternatives",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of statistical methods and seasonal patterns, but ultimately simplified to heuristic averaging due to data constraints. Included multi-step analysis of temporal patterns, model suitability, and calendar effects.",
