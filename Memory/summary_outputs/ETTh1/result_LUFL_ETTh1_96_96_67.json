  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data sequences with clear daily seasonality. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet) but ultimately selects a simple averaging technique due to data limitations. Key considerations include robust handling of potential missing values, explicit pattern recognition, and careful output formatting. The reasoning is thorough but constrained by the 4-day dataset, leading to a baseline solution.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Intra-day variations (e.g., consistent dips at 8:00)",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend",
    "Handling of potential missing values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple models to avoid over-parameterization",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality when trends are inconsistent",
    "Rounding protocols must match input data precision (3 decimals with half-to-even rule)",
    "Explicit validation of trend absence through daily mean calculations",
    "Future forecasting requires robustness against missing values despite complete historical data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step validation: Includes method comparison, data pattern analysis, statistical checks (daily averages), computational implementation, and output formatting. Balances advanced model awareness with pragmatic simplicity due to data limitations.",
