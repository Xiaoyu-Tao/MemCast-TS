  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by using a straightforward averaging method to capture hourly patterns, while acknowledging limitations like potential trends and data length constraints. The step-by-step process shows careful data examination, pattern recognition, and implementation of a seasonal naive model with precise rounding for output consistency.",
