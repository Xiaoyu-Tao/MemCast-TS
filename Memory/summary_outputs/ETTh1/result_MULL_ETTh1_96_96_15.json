  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on handling anomalies and leveraging observed patterns. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and an anomalous constant day, leading to a practical solution using simple averaging instead of complex models due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes interpretability and data-specific adaptations over sophisticated algorithms.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomaly detection (constant values interpreted as outliers)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous data points (e.g., constant-value days) to prevent skewing forecasts",
    "Preference for simple methods over complex models (SARIMA/ETS) when data is limited or contains irregularities",
    "Leveraging recurring hourly patterns as the primary forecasting mechanism",
    "Explicit timestamp generation for future periods based on input data boundaries"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, anomaly handling, and pattern analysis, but simplifies implementation through averaging. Balances statistical considerations with practical constraints.",
