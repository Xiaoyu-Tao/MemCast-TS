  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive, multi-step approach to forecasting 96 hourly data points. The analyst systematically checks for missing values, identifies daily seasonality, and evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) before settling on a heuristic approach. The process involves decomposing the series, computing daily profiles, analyzing trends in daily averages, and adjusting for level changes. The reasoning is thorough but constrained by limited data (4 days), leading to manual calculations and trade-offs between complexity and feasibility.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Downward trend in daily averages",
    "Anomaly detection (e.g., low values on 2017-10-01)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality dominates patterns, making hourly averaging essential for forecasts",
    "Linear regression on daily averages captures subtle trends despite limited data",
    "Additive adjustment of daily profiles accounts for projected level changes",
    "Weekly seasonality cannot be modeled reliably with only 4 days of data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical and heuristic reasoning. Involves data decomposition, regression modeling, manual computations, and method comparisons, reflecting advanced analytical depth constrained by data limitations.",
