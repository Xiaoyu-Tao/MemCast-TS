  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, focusing on identifying daily patterns while acknowledging challenges like potential day-of-week effects and missing value concerns. The solution emphasizes robustness over complexity, ultimately selecting a simple averaging method to generate a complete forecast.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly pattern variability (e.g., higher nighttime loads)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Day-of-week variations (noted but not modeled due to data limitations)",
    "Complete data handling (no actual missing values in input)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Data length constraints preclude complex models (SARIMA/ETS) despite recognizing their theoretical suitability",
    "Day-of-week misalignment between historical and forecast periods necessitates simplified approaches",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days provides stability for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit rounding to match input data precision (3 decimals) for consistency",
    "Trade-off between capturing variability (recent patterns) and stability (multi-day averages)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Involves multi-step evaluation of seasonality, data adequacy, and method trade-offs, but implements a straightforward computational solution due to data limitations.",
