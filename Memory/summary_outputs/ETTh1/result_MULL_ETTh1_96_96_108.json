  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data sequences with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by selecting a straightforward averaging method over complex models due to limited data points (96 hours), while systematically addressing data characteristics like potential missing values and stationarity assumptions.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Potential non-stationary behavior",
    "Absence of missing values in provided data",
    "Noise in hourly observations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of simple models (e.g., hourly averaging) over complex methods like SARIMA to avoid overfitting with limited data",
    "Explicit handling of seasonality through hour-of-day pattern extraction",
    "Data smoothing via multi-day averaging to reduce noise impact",
    "Assumption of short-term stationarity for near-term forecasting",
    "Systematic date generation for multi-step horizon alignment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints. Features method comparison (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing rejection), detailed pattern analysis, and step-by-step computational logic, but simplifies implementation through averaging heuristics.",
