  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach for forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. Given only 4 days of historical data, the analyst prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging, explicitly rejecting complex models like SARIMA due to data limitations. The reasoning is systematic, focusing on pattern recognition, data completeness verification, and practical implementation, though it lacks trend consideration and relies heavily on the assumption of stable seasonality.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Consistent hourly fluctuations (e.g., peaks at hour 6, troughs at hour 12)",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided segment)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Decomposition by hour-of-day to isolate and leverage daily seasonality",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models due to limited data (4 days)",
    "Data rounding strategy (to 3 decimals) mirroring input precision",
    "Handling of negative values during averaging and rounding"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple: Focuses on basic arithmetic operations and pattern repetition, with considered but dismissed references to advanced methods. Involves multi-step calculations but lacks statistical rigor or uncertainty quantification.",
