  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step analysis of a time-series forecasting task, focusing on handling data anomalies and short history. The analyst initially considers statistical models like Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA but settles on a custom heuristic method due to computational constraints and data irregularities. The approach is thorough in identifying patterns and challenges but shows limitations in trend sustainability awareness.",

    "Exclusion of anomalous data (constant-value day) from modeling inputs",
