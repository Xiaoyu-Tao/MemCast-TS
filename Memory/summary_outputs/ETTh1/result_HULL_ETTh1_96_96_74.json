  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by identifying daily seasonality patterns and rejecting complex models due to data constraints. Key strengths include thorough data inspection, consideration of multiple methods, and clear implementation of a simple averaging technique that accounts for hourly patterns.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Presence of negative values",
    "Limited historical data (4 days)",
    "Non-repeating daily patterns"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour-of-day to capture daily seasonality",
    "Rejecting complex models (SARIMA/Holt-Winters) due to limited data",
    "Using hourly averages across multiple days as forecasting basis",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Repeating 24-hour pattern for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition with method evaluation, though ultimately selects a simple heuristic approach. Includes manual computation of hourly averages and considers data limitations thoroughly.",
