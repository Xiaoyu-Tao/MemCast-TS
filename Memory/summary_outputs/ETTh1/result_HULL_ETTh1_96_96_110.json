{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality due to limited historical data (96 hourly points). The modeler prioritizes simplicity and feasibility, opting for a straightforward averaging method after considering but rejecting more complex models like SARIMA as impractical given the short history. The analysis thoroughly addresses data characteristics, potential issues like missing values, and provides a detailed implementation plan.",
