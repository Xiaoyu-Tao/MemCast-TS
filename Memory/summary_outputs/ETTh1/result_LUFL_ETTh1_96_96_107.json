  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach focused on handling daily seasonality through simple averaging methods. The analysis prioritizes practical implementation constraints (no code execution) by using historical hourly averages while acknowledging data limitations (short 4-day horizon) that prevent complex trend or weekly pattern detection. Quality is maintained through rigorous hour-by-hour pattern replication and 3-decimal precision.",
