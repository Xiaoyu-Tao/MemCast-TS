  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity by identifying daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and dismissing complex models like ARIMA/ETS due to insufficient history. The method relies on hourly averaging after confirming no significant trend, resulting in a straightforward but contextually appropriate solution.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts model complexity and prevents weekly pattern capture",
    "Daily averages used to verify trend absence before applying hourly averaging",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity for forecast period alignment",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with strong data inspection: Includes data completeness checks, trend/seasonality analysis, and method comparisons, but defaults to simple heuristics due to data constraints.",
