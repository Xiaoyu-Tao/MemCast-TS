  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting for hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. Given the limited historical data (96 points), the analyst prioritizes simplicity by using an averaging method to capture daily patterns while acknowledging data constraints. The approach focuses on pattern recognition and pragmatic solutions over complex modeling, with careful attention to data formatting and seasonality considerations.",
