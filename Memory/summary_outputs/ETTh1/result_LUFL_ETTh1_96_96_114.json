  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling daily seasonality with limited historical records (4 days). The analyst prioritized simplicity by using hourly averaging across available days, acknowledging data constraints and potential weekly patterns while opting for a heuristic method over complex models due to insufficient training data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Stable hourly patterns with minor variations",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized daily pattern capture over weekly due to limited data",
    "Used cross-day hourly averaging as a robust heuristic for multi-day forecasts",
    "Addressed missing value potential through complete historical data utilization",
    "Evaluated but dismissed complex models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) due to data limitations"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of multiple approaches, seasonal decomposition considerations, and explicit pattern analysis, ultimately implementing a simple but justified heuristic solution.",
