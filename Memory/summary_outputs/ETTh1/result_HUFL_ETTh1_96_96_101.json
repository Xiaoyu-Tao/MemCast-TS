  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under computational constraints. It begins by considering advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but defaults to a heuristic weighted average method due to the text-based environment. The approach focuses on daily patterns, uses recursive forecasting with exponentially decreasing weights, and emphasizes handling seasonality through day-wise pattern replication. The reasoning is thorough but constrained by the inability to execute actual model fitting.",
