  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly oil temperature data. It begins with data inspection, identifies daily seasonality and potential outliers, evaluates multiple modeling approaches (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately selects a median-based seasonal naive method due to the short 4-day dataset. The approach prioritizes robustness against anomalies while maintaining computational simplicity.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short time series (96 points) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA requires more seasonal cycles)",
    "Median outperforms mean for robustness against outliers in hourly aggregation",
    "Data reshaping into 4x24 matrix enables efficient hourly pattern analysis",
    "Forecast assumes stable daily patterns for near-term predictions",
