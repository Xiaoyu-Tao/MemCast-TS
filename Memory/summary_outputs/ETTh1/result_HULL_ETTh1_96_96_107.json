  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting by leveraging observed daily seasonality. It uses a simple averaging method to capture hourly patterns, explicitly ignoring potential trends due to the limited 4-day history and short horizon. The solution is methodical but relies on strong assumptions about pattern stability, with careful attention to data formatting and rounding.",
