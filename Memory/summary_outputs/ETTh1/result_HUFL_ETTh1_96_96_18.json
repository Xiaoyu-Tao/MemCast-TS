  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging technique to handle daily seasonality. The analyst works with 96 hours of historical data to forecast the next 96 hours, identifying a 24-hour cyclical pattern while acknowledging data limitations and potential inconsistencies. The approach prioritizes simplicity due to the short history (4 days), avoiding complex models that might overfit.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Variability in daily patterns (non-repeating fluctuations)",
    "No missing values in the provided dataset",
    "Higher load during night/morning hours, lower during daytime"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour and averaging across days captures daily seasonality efficiently",
    "Limited historical records (4 days) restrict trend detection and complex modeling",
    "Manual computation of hourly averages ensures transparency in the forecasting process",
    "Repeating the 24-hour average pattern for all forecasted days simplifies multi-step forecasting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data inspection and manual calculations, but relies on simple averaging heuristics rather than advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
