  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting a short time-series with clear daily seasonality. The analyst has 96 hourly data points and needs to forecast the next 96 hours. After evaluating methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, they opt for a simple averaging technique due to data limitations (only 4 days of history). The approach focuses on identifying and extrapolating daily patterns while acknowledging constraints like insufficient data for complex models.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Consistent intraday pattern (highs at midnight, lows in afternoon)",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (4 days) restricts complex model application",
    "Daily patterns can be captured through hourly averaging",
    "Trend analysis is unreliable with short time spans",
    "Seasonal naive methods are practical for small datasets",
    "Data normalization via averaging mitigates day-to-day fluctuations"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Includes method evaluation (SARIMA/ETS), detailed pattern analysis, and data-driven justification for simplicity. Balances statistical considerations with pragmatic constraints of small datasets.",
