  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and handling data constraints. After evaluating multiple methods, it settles on a simple averaging technique to capture the diurnal pattern, emphasizing robustness over complexity due to the small dataset size (96 hourly points). The analysis thoroughly considers data characteristics, potential missing values, and outliers while justifying methodological choices.",

    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern and must be explicitly captured in forecasts.",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like ARIMA/ETS.",
