  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical points (96 hours). The analyst prioritizes handling potential missing values, identifies data patterns, evaluates multiple modeling approaches, and ultimately selects a practical heuristic method due to data constraints. The process shows careful consideration of seasonality and trend despite the short history.",
