  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on short-term forecasting using limited historical data (4 days). The analyst prioritized simplicity due to data constraints, opting for a simple averaging method after evaluating but rejecting more sophisticated models like SARIMA due to insufficient training data. Key considerations included potential daily seasonality detection and missing value handling precautions.",
