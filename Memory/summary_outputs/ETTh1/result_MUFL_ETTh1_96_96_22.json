  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, evaluates multiple methods, and selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. Key considerations include handling potential trends, prioritizing recent data, and ensuring precise output formatting. The solution prioritizes practicality over complex modeling given the small dataset.",
