  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting time-series data with strong daily seasonality and limited historical data. The analyst identified clear daily patterns, acknowledged data limitations (only 4 days of history), and implemented a simple yet effective averaging method to generate forecasts. The approach prioritized robustness over complexity given the constraints, with thorough attention to data rounding and datetime handling.",

  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24)",
    "Higher values during night (peaking at 6-7 AM)",
    "Lower daytime values with noon dip",
    "Consistent pattern repetition across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Averaging same-hour observations across available days creates a robust daily profile for forecasting",
    "Limited historical records prevent weekly seasonality modeling despite day-of-week awareness",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals maintains consistency with original data precision",
    "Explicit datetime handling ensures correct sequence alignment for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, data limitations assessment, and practical implementation of a simple method with detailed computational steps and datetime management.",
