  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting using limited historical records. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, acknowledges data limitations, and selects a simple averaging method as a robust solution. The approach prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while maintaining reasonable accuracy for the given constraints.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher nighttime values and lower daytime values",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "Absence of missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simpler models over complex statistical methods",
    "Daily patterns can be effectively captured through hourly averaging when weekly seasonality is unattainable",
    "Data granularity (hourly) directly informs seasonality period selection",
    "Practical implementation requires rounding consistency and date sequence generation",
    "Heuristic methods provide viable baselines when model selection is constrained"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with clear step-by-step logic, focusing on data observation and practical implementation rather than advanced statistical modeling. Balances pattern recognition with computational feasibility.",
