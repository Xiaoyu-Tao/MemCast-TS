  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies strong daily seasonality and attempts to account for weekly patterns despite having only four days of historical data. The solution prioritizes simplicity by averaging corresponding hours from available weekdays (Friday and Monday) to forecast future weekdays, with careful rounding to match input precision. The approach acknowledges data limitations but provides a justifiable baseline forecast.",

    "Prioritization of weekday data over weekends for weekday forecasts due to behavioral differences",
    "Use of averaged hourly patterns from limited similar days (Friday/Monday) as proxy for future weekdays",
    "Rounding of forecasted values to 3 decimal places to maintain input data consistency",
    "Explicit handling of data scarcity by repeating the same daily pattern across forecast horizon",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Involves pattern recognition, day-type differentiation, and weighted considerations, yet simplifies to averaging due to data constraints. Avoids advanced models given limited history.",
