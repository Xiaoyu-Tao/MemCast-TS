  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-term data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identifies patterns, addresses potential anomalies, and selects a robust median-based method to generate forecasts while accounting for data completeness and output formatting requirements. The approach prioritizes simplicity and outlier resilience given the limited 4-day historical data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Presence of outliers/anomalies (e.g., midnight spike on 2016-10-03)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Using hourly medians instead of averages to mitigate outlier influence",
    "Recognizing insufficient data for weekly seasonality modeling",

    "Validating data completeness before model selection",
    "Maintaining original data precision (3 decimal places) in output"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern analysis and statistical computations. Combines data inspection, outlier handling, and heuristic modeling, but avoids advanced algorithms due to data limitations.",
