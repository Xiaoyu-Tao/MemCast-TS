  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying seasonality and selecting simple, interpretable methods. The analyst prioritizes handling of short data history (96 points) and clear daily patterns, opting for heuristic methods over complex statistical models due to data limitations. The approach emphasizes pattern recognition and method justification but shows limited exploration of advanced techniques.",

    "Seasonal Naive": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Pattern repetition with magnitude variations",
    "Absence of strong trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided set)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Strong daily patterns (dips during daytime, rises at night) drive method selection",
    "Short data history (4 days) limits model complexity and favors simple heuristics",
    "Seasonal Naive method preferred over averaging to capture recent changes",
    "Forecasts generated by repeating the last observed 24-hour cycle",
    "Explicit consideration of trade-offs: noise smoothing (averaging) vs. recency (naive)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with heuristic focus. Relies on observable patterns and basic time-series principles without statistical modeling. Includes method comparisons but lacks advanced techniques like SARIMA or exponential smoothing due to data length constraints.",
