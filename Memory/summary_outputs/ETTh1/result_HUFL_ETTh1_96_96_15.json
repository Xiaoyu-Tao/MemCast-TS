  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly HUFL data with limited history. Key steps include data inspection for missing values, identification of daily seasonality, anomaly detection in historical patterns, method selection considering data constraints, and implementation of a robust median-based forecasting technique. The approach balances statistical rigor with practical heuristics to handle data limitations.",

    "Heuristic Analysis": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Presence of anomalous patterns (constant-value day)",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Hourly frequency requiring seasonal handling"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern requiring explicit modeling",
    "Median-based aggregation provides robustness against anomalous days",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) prevents complex modeling like weekly seasonality",
    "Forecast horizon (96 hours) matches historical pattern length for direct replication"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step reasoning: combines data diagnostics, pattern recognition, method comparison, anomaly handling, and implementation details while acknowledging limitations of small datasets.",
