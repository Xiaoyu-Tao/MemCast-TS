  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for missing values and outliers, evaluates multiple modeling approaches (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately selects a robust heuristic method due to data constraints. The process emphasizes practical adaptation to data limitations and anomaly handling.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing robust statistics (median over mean) to handle outliers in small datasets",
    "Acknowledging data limitations (only 4 days) prevents overcomplication with models like SARIMA",
    "Explicitly verifying data completeness before forecasting",
    "Hourly pattern consistency enables simple yet effective forecasting via hourly aggregation"
