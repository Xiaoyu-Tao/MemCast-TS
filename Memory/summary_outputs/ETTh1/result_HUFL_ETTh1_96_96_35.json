  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on handling short-term hourly data with daily seasonality using a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days). While advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were considered, the implementation defaulted to a seasonal naive approach by averaging hourly values across available days. The analysis demonstrates awareness of potential missing values and non-stationarity but prioritizes practicality given constraints.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with statistical considerations - combines model awareness with practical simplifications. Shows multi-step analysis including seasonality detection, model selection reasoning, and manual pattern calculation, but ultimately implements elementary averaging due to data limitations.",
