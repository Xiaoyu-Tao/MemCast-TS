  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a highly detailed, multi-step analytical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It emphasizes identifying patterns like daily seasonality and potential trends, then systematically evaluates multiple modeling approaches before selecting a tailored solution. The process includes thorough data examination, method comparison, mathematical implementation, and acknowledges data limitations while maintaining rigor.",
