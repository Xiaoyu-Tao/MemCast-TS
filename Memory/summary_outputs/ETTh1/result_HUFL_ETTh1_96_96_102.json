  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting, starting with data understanding and pattern identification, then evaluating multiple methods before selecting a simple seasonal naive approach due to data limitations and inconsistent trends. The analysis is thorough but ultimately favors simplicity for the 96-hour forecast.",
