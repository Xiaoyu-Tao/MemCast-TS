  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options under constraints, and implements a practical solution using simple averaging. The process emphasizes data completeness checks, seasonality recognition, and heuristic adjustments while acknowledging limitations in trend capture due to the short data horizon.",

  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of negative values",
    "Non-stationarity",
    "Data completeness (no missing values in sample)",
    "Inconsistent daily trends"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging across multiple days effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Rounding forecasted values to match input data precision (3 decimals) is essential for consistency",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern for the forecast horizon provides a baseline when trend signals are weak",
    "Explicit data validation (e.g., missing value checks) precedes modeling decisions",
    "Trade-offs between model complexity and implementation constraints drive method selection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: combines data inspection, method evaluation (SARIMA/ETS considerations), statistical computation of hourly averages, and output formatting. Balances theoretical modeling concepts with practical heuristic implementation.",
