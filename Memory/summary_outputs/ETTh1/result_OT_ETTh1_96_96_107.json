  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on identifying daily seasonality and an upward trend in the historical data. While initially considering SARIMA for its seasonal capabilities, the analysis pivoted to heuristic methods due to computational constraints. The final approach used a simple average of the last two days' hourly patterns, adjusted for observed trends, to generate a repeating 24-hour forecast. The reasoning demonstrated awareness of data limitations and trend volatility but prioritized simplicity for short-term forecasting.",
