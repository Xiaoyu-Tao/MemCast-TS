  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, focusing on identifying patterns and selecting appropriate methods given data constraints. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality, evaluates multiple models (Holt-Winters, SARIMA), but ultimately adopts a simple seasonal averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The solution emphasizes practicality, data completeness checks, and pattern-based forecasting while addressing the challenge of generating 96-hour forecasts without computational execution.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Prioritization of simple methods (seasonal averaging) for short historical data",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough model evaluation and fallback to heuristic methods. Includes statistical considerations (trend analysis, seasonality detection) but simplifies implementation due to data limitations and operational constraints.",
