  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited time-series data (96 hourly points). It identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, considers advanced models like SARIMA but opts for simple averaging due to data constraints. The solution prioritizes robustness over complexity, emphasizing data completeness checks and pattern-based heuristics.",
