  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies key challenges including daily seasonality, a suspicious constant-value day (treated as an anomaly), and insufficient data for weekly pattern detection. After considering multiple methods, they settle on a simple averaging heuristic using recent non-anomalous days due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes recency and practicality over complex modeling.",
