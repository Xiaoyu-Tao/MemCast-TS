  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting for hourly transformer load data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for trends and missing values, evaluates advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, but ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The solution focuses on practicality, computing hourly averages from historical data and projecting them forward while ensuring output formatting consistency.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal pattern)",
    "Higher nighttime values and lower daytime values",
    "Absence of consistent trend",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity when historical data is limited (4 days)",
    "Using same-hour averages across days to capture seasonality",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Generating identical daily patterns in absence of clear trend",
    "Validating timestamp continuity for output formatting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplification: Starts with advanced model considerations but reverts to heuristic averaging after data inspection. Includes manual pattern analysis, multi-step computation of hourly averages, and output generation logic.",
