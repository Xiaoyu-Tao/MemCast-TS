  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, methodical approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality and handling irregularities like spikes, ultimately selecting an exponential smoothing method with custom weights after evaluating multiple alternatives. The analysis is thorough but constrained by the short historical window.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Exponential Smoothing": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Irregular spikes (e.g., 2016-09-18 spike)",
    "Consistent daily pattern (high nighttime values, daytime drops)",
    "Limited trend visibility due to short data history"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Emphasis on recent data via weighted exponential smoothing (weights: 0.5 for last day, 0.25 for prior, 0.125 for earlier days)",
    "Recognition of data limitations (4 days) preventing weekly seasonality analysis",
    "Hourly pattern replication for multi-day forecasts after smoothing",
    "Spike handling through weighted averaging rather than direct replication"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: evaluates SARIMA, seasonal decomposition, and naive methods; performs hour-by-hour pattern examination; includes weighted calculations and edge-case considerations for spikes.",
