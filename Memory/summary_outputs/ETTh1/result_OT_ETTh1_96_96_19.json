  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying patterns and selecting simple yet effective methods. The analyst prioritizes handling data constraints (short history, potential missing values) while leveraging observed daily seasonality. The approach is pragmatic, evaluating multiple heuristics before settling on a two-day average method with pattern repetition, and includes careful output formatting.",
