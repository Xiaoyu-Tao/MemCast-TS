  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting that begins with complex statistical models but ultimately adopts a simple heuristic method due to computational constraints. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling techniques (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but settles on a daily-averaging method for its robustness and interpretability given limited data. The solution prioritizes feasibility while addressing data anomalies like zero values.",

    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern requiring explicit modeling",
    "Limited historical data (96 points) constrains complex model selection",
    "Anomalies (e.g., zero values) must be addressed through robust averaging",
    "Computational constraints necessitate simplified approaches",
    "Most recent 3-day patterns provide better forecasting basis than full history"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis with detailed model considerations, but ultimately simplified to heuristic execution due to practical constraints. Balances statistical rigor with pragmatic implementation.",
