  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identified patterns, considered advanced models like SARIMA, but ultimately implemented a simple averaging method due to computational constraints. The approach prioritized practical implementation by averaging hourly values across historical days and repeating the pattern for the forecast horizon, while acknowledging limitations like potential weekly seasonality and trend considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No missing values in the provided data segment",
    "Negative daytime and positive nighttime values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, with consistent hourly fluctuations repeating every 24 hours",
    "Weak overall trend observed across the 4-day historical period",
    "Insufficient data for weekly seasonality analysis limits forecasting accuracy",
    "Averaging same-hour values across historical days provides a practical baseline forecast",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for forecasting periods"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines theoretical model consideration (SARIMA) with practical heuristics. Includes multi-step analysis of seasonality, trend evaluation, and data decomposition concepts, but simplifies implementation due to constraints.",
