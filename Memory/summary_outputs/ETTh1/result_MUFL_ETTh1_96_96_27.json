  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analysis focused on forecasting hourly transformer load data with limited historical points (96 hours). It emphasizes handling data constraints, evaluates multiple modeling approaches, and selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The reasoning is systematic, covering data inspection, method comparison, and step-by-step computation.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No significant trend observed",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Hourly pattern variability across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts model complexity, making weekly seasonality inestimable",
    "Simple hourly averaging is preferred over SARIMA/ETS due to minimal data points",
    "Identical daily patterns are projected for forecasts despite potential weekend effects",
    "Explicit handling of timestamps and rounding precision for output consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: evaluates advanced models, performs data decomposition considerations, and includes manual computations for all 24 hourly averages with rounding logic.",
