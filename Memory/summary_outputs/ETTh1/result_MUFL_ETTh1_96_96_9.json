  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and implementing simple, feasible methods under computational constraints. The analyst recognizes daily seasonality, evaluates trend considerations, and selects a straightforward averaging technique to generate forecasts. The process emphasizes data grouping, pattern repetition, and manual calculations while balancing simplicity with seasonal pattern capture.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Intra-day fluctuations (lower daytime values, higher nighttime values)",
    "Inconsistent trend patterns",
