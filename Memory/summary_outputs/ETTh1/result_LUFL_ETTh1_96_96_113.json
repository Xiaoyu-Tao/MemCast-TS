  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on daily seasonality patterns and data limitations. The analysis prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging to handle clear 24-hour cycles, acknowledges potential weekly patterns but dismisses them due to insufficient historical data, and emphasizes robustness against missing values despite their absence in the provided dataset.",
