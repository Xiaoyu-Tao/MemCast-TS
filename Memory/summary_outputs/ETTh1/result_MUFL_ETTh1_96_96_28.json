  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-history time-series forecasting with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identifies data patterns, acknowledges limitations (only 4 days of historical data), and rejects complex models like SARIMA in favor of a simple averaging method. Key considerations include handling weekday-weekend variations and potential anomalies, resulting in a heuristic solution that prioritizes interpretability over statistical sophistication given data constraints.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong practical adaptations: Starts with advanced model considerations but simplifies to heuristic methods due to data limitations. Includes multi-step pattern analysis, day-type classification, and manual computation of hourly averages, while maintaining awareness of real-world constraints like potential missing values.",
