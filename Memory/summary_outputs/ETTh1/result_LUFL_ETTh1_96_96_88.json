  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on leveraging observed daily seasonality for multi-step forecasting. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for heuristic methods over complex statistical models due to data characteristics and implementation constraints. The analysis effectively identifies patterns but acknowledges limitations in handling potential trends or missing values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable intra-day patterns with consistent peak/off-peak behaviors",
    "Absence of clear long-term directional trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided segment)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging as a robust method for capturing daily patterns in stable seasonal data",
    "Explicit handling of time-of-day effects through grouped hour calculations",

    "Pattern repetition for multi-period forecasting when trend is negligible",
    "Recognition of SARIMA/ETS limitations without parameter tuning capabilities"
