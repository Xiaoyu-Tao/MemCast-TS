  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to forecasting 96 hourly data points with limited historical data (4 days). It begins with data quality assessment, identifies and handles a 24-hour anomaly through imputation, considers advanced models like SARIMA, but ultimately adopts a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The process emphasizes robustness, seasonality awareness, and practical trade-offs between model sophistication and data limitations.",

    "Imputation of anomalous data using same-hour averages from valid days",
