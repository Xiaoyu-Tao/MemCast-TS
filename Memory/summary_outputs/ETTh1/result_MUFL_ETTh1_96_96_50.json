  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analysis of time-series data with 96 points, focusing on handling anomalies and short data constraints. The approach prioritizes robustness by using median-based heuristics to mitigate the impact of outliers in the last day's data, while acknowledging limitations of complex models like SARIMA due to limited historical data.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Median aggregation provides robustness against anomalies compared to mean",
    "Small dataset size (96 points) limits complex model applicability",
