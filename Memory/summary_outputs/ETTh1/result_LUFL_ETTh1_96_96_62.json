  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on handling daily seasonality and limited historical data (4 days) to forecast 96 future values. While considering advanced methods like SARIMA and exponential smoothing, the analysis ultimately adopts a simple averaging approach due to data constraints. The solution prioritizes practicality over complexity, acknowledging potential weekly pattern limitations but proceeding with hourly averages from available weekdays.",
