  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough exploration of time-series forecasting methods for a 96-hour LULL dataset. It begins by identifying key characteristics like daily seasonality and a downward trend, then systematically evaluates multiple approaches including seasonal naive, exponential smoothing, and linear regression with seasonal dummies. Due to data limitations (only 4 days of hourly data) and manual calculation constraints, the analysis ultimately adopts a practical heuristic method that prioritizes simplicity while accounting for observed patterns.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Downward trend across days",
    "Absence of missing values in historical data",
    "Value range constraints (non-negative values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) complicates complex model fitting and favors simpler, interpretable methods",
    "Trend adjustments are essential for forecasts but require safeguards against negative values",
    "Daily seasonality must be considered alongside overall trend patterns",
    "Manual implementation constraints influence method selection despite theoretical optimality"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical exploration, transitioning to moderately complex heuristics due to practical constraints. Includes trend quantification, seasonal decomposition, and parameter sensitivity analysis before simplifying for implementation.",
