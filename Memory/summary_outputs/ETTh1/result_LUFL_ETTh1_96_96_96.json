{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analysis of time-series data with clear daily seasonality and an emerging trend. It systematically evaluates multiple forecasting approaches, initially considering SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately adopting a custom heuristic method due to limited historical records (only 4 days). The solution combines statistical trend projection with intraday pattern analysis, resulting in a detailed, data-driven forecasting approach that accounts for both seasonality and trend components.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Upward trend in daily averages",
    "Evening consumption peaks (20:00-21:00)",
    "Low nighttime consumption"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model application, favoring heuristic approaches",
    "Daily averages show consistent linear growth, projected via regression for future forecasts",
    "Intraday patterns are captured through relative factors (hourly values normalized by daily averages)",
    "Forecasts combine projected daily trends with averaged hourly seasonal patterns"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical analysis, involving data decomposition, regression modeling, and pattern normalization across 96 data points.",
