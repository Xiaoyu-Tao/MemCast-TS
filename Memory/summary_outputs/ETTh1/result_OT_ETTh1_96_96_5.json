  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and potential trends while emphasizing simplicity due to the 4-day data constraint. The seasonal naive method is selected as the primary approach, repeating the last observed day's pattern for the forecast period, with considerations for data completeness and timestamp generation.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Seasonal Naive": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (temperature rises daytime, falls nighttime)",
    "Possible upward trend (noted but uncertain due to limited data)",
    "No missing values in provided data (though flagged as potential concern)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern leveraged for forecasting",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) constrains model selection to simple methods",
    "Most recent day's pattern is prioritized over historical averaging for relevance",
    "Explicit handling of timestamp generation for 96-hour forecast horizon",
    "Precision maintenance in output formatting (6 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves data pattern recognition, method comparison (seasonal naive vs. averaging), and practical implementation considerations, but constrained by data limitations preventing advanced statistical modeling.",
