  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analytical process for time-series forecasting, focusing on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) to predict the next 96 hours. The approach emphasizes identifying seasonality, evaluating model suitability, and addressing data constraints. It prioritizes simplicity due to limited data, ultimately selecting a heuristic averaging method after considering and rejecting more complex models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing. The reasoning is detailed, data-driven, and carefully justifies methodological choices.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (period=24)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Consistent hourly patterns (higher values at night, lower during day)",
    "No missing values in the provided segment"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents modeling weekly seasonality or complex trends",
    "Daily patterns dominate and can be captured through hourly averaging",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across days is robust for short-term forecasts",
    "Daily average stability justifies assuming constant level for future periods",
    "Seasonal indices (hourly values relative to daily average) validate pattern consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: involves data inspection, model comparison (SARIMA/ETS), statistical decomposition, and custom heuristic development with mathematical validation of seasonal indices and averaging logic.",
