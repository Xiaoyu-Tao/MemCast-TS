  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting 96 hours of hourly data with clear daily seasonality. Given limited historical data (only 96 points), the model prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging to capture daily patterns, while acknowledging limitations like potential weekly effects and trends. The solution emphasizes data completeness and consistency in formatting.",
