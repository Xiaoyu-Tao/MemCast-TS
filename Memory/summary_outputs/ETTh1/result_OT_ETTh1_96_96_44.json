  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). While considering multiple statistical methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), the analysis ultimately adopts a simple hourly pattern averaging approach due to data constraints. The solution emphasizes daily seasonality recognition and handles data completeness while acknowledging potential trends and outlier impacts.",

    "Prioritized simplicity over complex models due to limited historical data (4 daily cycles)",
    "Used hourly averaging to capture daily patterns while smoothing outliers",
