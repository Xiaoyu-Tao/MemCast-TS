  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, starting with data validation and seasonality identification. While sophisticated models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing were considered, practical constraints led to a simple averaging heuristic. The analyst emphasized handling potential missing values (though none were found), identified daily patterns, and implemented a seasonal naive method with careful rounding for the final output.",
