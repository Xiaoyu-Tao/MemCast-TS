  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting using limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on daily seasonality detection, handles data completeness concerns, and selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex modeling. The approach prioritizes practicality and completeness of output while acknowledging limitations in capturing weekly patterns or trends.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over weekly patterns due to limited data (only 4 days available)",
    "Use of hourly averaging as a practical solution for short-term forecasting with minimal historical data",
    "Explicit handling of data formatting and rounding to match input specifications",
    "Acknowledgment of limitations in trend detection and weekly pattern analysis",
    "Emphasis on generating complete output without missing values despite potential data issues"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with robust data inspection and method justification, but utilizes simple heuristics due to data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, data completeness, and pattern consistency before selecting the averaging approach.",
