  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. The analyst systematically inspects data patterns, considers method alternatives, computes hourly averages across 4 days of historical data, and repeats this pattern for the forecast horizon. The approach prioritizes simplicity given the limited historical data (96 hours) and focuses on handling key constraints like maintaining output format precision.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly pattern variations across days",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend",
    "Data completeness in provided samples",
    "Consistent time-series frequency (hourly)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern for forecasting",
    "Short data history limits weekly seasonality detection",
    "Simple averaging per hour provides a viable baseline method",
    "Output precision must match input (3 decimal places)",
    "Date sequencing requires careful handling across month boundaries"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with emphasis on data handling: Focuses on basic pattern recognition and averaging, avoids advanced models due to data limitations, includes detailed output formatting considerations.",
