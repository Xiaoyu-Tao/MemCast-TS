  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a straightforward heuristic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-term seasonal patterns. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by using daily averaging to capture seasonality, explicitly avoiding complex models due to limited data. The analysis is systematic but constrained by the small dataset (96 points), with clear steps for data handling, pattern identification, and forecast generation.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging over identical time slots captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Short data horizons (4 days) necessitate simple methods and trend exclusion",
    "Negative values are preserved in forecasts as legitimate data characteristics",
    "Rounding outputs to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input precision",
    "Repeating averaged daily cycles for multi-day forecasts simplifies projection"

  "complexity_analysis": "Mostly simple heuristics with arithmetic operations; no advanced statistical modeling or machine learning. Focuses on data aggregation and pattern replication without addressing trends, external factors, or model validation.",
