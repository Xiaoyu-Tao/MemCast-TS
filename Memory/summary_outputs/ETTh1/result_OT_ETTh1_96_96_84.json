{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough, step-by-step approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling seasonality and anomalies. The analyst identifies daily patterns, addresses outlier impacts, and selects a robust median-based method over simpler averaging to generate a 96-hour forecast. The process includes data validation, pattern analysis, and practical implementation considerations.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Median-based aggregation provides robustness against anomalies compared to mean-based methods",
    "Daily patterns can be extrapolated for multi-day forecasts through repetition of derived hourly profiles",
    "Anomaly detection significantly influences method selection (e.g., rejecting simple averaging due to outlier sensitivity)",
    "Data reshaping into daily matrices enables efficient hourly pattern analysis"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analytical reasoning: combines data validation, pattern decomposition, outlier handling, and practical implementation trade-offs, though avoids advanced statistical models like SARIMA.",
