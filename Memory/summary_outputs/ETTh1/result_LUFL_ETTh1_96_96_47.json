  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns in limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes daily seasonality detection, evaluates model suitability given data constraints, and selects a simple averaging method as the optimal solution. The approach emphasizes robustness over complexity due to the small dataset size.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns with nighttime dips and daytime peaks",
    "No discernible long-term trend",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA/ETS) due to insufficient seasonal cycles",
    "Daily patterns show inter-day variation but maintain consistent hourly profiles",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days provides more stability than single-day replication",
    "Data completeness verification is essential before processing",
    "Forecast horizon (96 hours) matches historical data length, enabling pattern repetition"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Involves data pattern analysis, model comparison, and method justification, but implements a computationally simple solution (hourly averaging) due to data limitations.",
