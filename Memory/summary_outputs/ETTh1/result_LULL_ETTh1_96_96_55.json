{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a limited dataset of 96 hourly points. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for trends and missing values, evaluates multiple modeling approaches (SARIMA, exponential smoothing), and ultimately selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The solution involves detailed hourly pattern analysis, mean calculations per hour across available days, and replication of this pattern for future forecasts, with careful rounding to match input precision.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",

    "Prioritizing simplicity when historical data is limited (4 days)",
    "Validating pattern consistency through daily average calculations",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough data examination: includes seasonality detection, trend analysis, method comparison, and multi-step computational validation, but ultimately implements a simple heuristic solution.",
