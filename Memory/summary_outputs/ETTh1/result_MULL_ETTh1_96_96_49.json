  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term time-series forecasting with limited data. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and employs a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The analysis shows careful consideration of alternative methods but prioritizes simplicity and interpretability given the 4-day dataset, while acknowledging limitations like potential missing values and insufficient data for trend detection.",

    "Prioritization of daily seasonality as the primary forecasting driver",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) due to limited 4-day dataset",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Includes method comparison and seasonal decomposition considerations but implements simplified averaging due to limited historical observations. Features detailed data inspection and step-by-step computational validation.",
