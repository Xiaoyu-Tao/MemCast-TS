  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality, acknowledging data limitations (4 days) that prevent more sophisticated modeling. The approach is pragmatic, focusing on observable daily patterns while recognizing but not resolving weekday/weekend variations due to insufficient data. Forecast quality relies on smoothing historical patterns without trend adjustment.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Higher load during daytime hours (e.g., 6-7 AM)",
    "Lower load at night",
    "Weekday/weekend variations (not modeled due to data constraints)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily pattern averaging as primary forecasting technique for short horizons",
    "Explicit consideration of weekday/weekend effects despite inability to model them",

    "Hourly pattern consistency prioritized over trend analysis",
    "Rounding outputs to match input precision (3 decimals)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step data examination (pattern identification, day-of-week analysis, averaging calculations) but simplifies to basic heuristics due to data constraints. Avoids advanced statistical models like ETS/ARIMA despite recognizing their potential.",
