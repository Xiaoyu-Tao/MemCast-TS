  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough, multi-step analytical approach focused on handling limited data (96 hourly points) for a 96-hour forecast. It initially considers standard models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but pivots to a heuristic decomposition method due to data constraints. The analysis emphasizes pattern recognition, manual calculations for daily averages and seasonal indices, and trend projection using Holt's linear method, balancing statistical rigor with practical approximations.",
