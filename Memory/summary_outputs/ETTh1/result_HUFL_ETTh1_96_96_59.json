  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to univariate time-series forecasting using limited data. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality patterns, handling data constraints, and implementing a simple yet robust averaging method. The analysis shows careful consideration of date logic, data completeness, and pattern consistency while acknowledging limitations like insufficient data for weekly seasonality modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Presence of negative values (considered valid)",
    "Data completeness in provided samples",
    "Hourly pattern repetition across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping data by hour-of-day to compute averages captures daily seasonality effectively",
    "Handling date/time boundaries precisely for multi-day forecasting windows",
    "Acknowledging limitations of small datasets for complex models (e.g., weekly seasonality)",
    "Rounding strategy alignment with input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Validation of data anomalies (negative values) without correction"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data handling: Includes pattern recognition, date arithmetic, multi-step averaging logic, and model selection reasoning, but avoids advanced statistical methods due to data constraints.",
