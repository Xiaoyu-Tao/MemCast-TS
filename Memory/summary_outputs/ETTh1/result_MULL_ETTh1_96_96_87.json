  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness given the constraints of only 4 days of historical data, ultimately selecting a straightforward averaging method. The reasoning is systematic, addressing data completeness, pattern recognition, and practical implementation trade-offs while acknowledging limitations in modeling trends or weekly seasonality.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for small datasets: Averaging same-hour values across available days is preferred over complex models when data is limited.",
    "Handling seasonality without matching days: Using generic hourly averages when historical days-of-week don't align with forecast period.",
    "Data completeness verification: Explicit checks for missing values before processing.",
    "Forecast horizon alignment: Structuring output as 4 repetitions of daily patterns to match the 96-hour requirement."

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines pattern recognition, method evaluation (seasonal naive vs. averaging), and practical implementation details, but constrained by data limitations that prevent advanced statistical modeling.",
