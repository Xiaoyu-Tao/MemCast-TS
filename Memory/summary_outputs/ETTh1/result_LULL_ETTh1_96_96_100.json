  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed, multi-step analytical approach for hourly time-series forecasting with limited data (96 points). It systematically identifies patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options (SARIMA, exponential smoothing), and selects a decomposition method combining linear trend projection and daily seasonality due to data constraints. The analysis includes thorough data validation, numerical computations, and trend-seasonality integration, reflecting strong methodological rigor.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Downward trend in daily averages",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Hourly pattern variability across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is captured through averaging corresponding hours across available days",
    "Linear regression on daily averages enables trend projection for future periods",
    "Forecasts combine trend-adjusted daily levels with normalized hourly patterns",
    "Data limitations (4 days) necessitate simpler models over parameter-heavy approaches like SARIMA"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical computations, including regression modeling, seasonal decomposition, and normalization procedures.",
