  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for trends and missing values, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The solution prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while maintaining alignment with observed patterns.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Consistent hourly fluctuations (temperature drops at night, rises during day)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity when data is limited (4 days)",
    "Grouping data by hour for seasonal pattern capture",
    "Averaging same-hour observations across multiple days for forecasts",
    "Rounding outputs to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Repeating the identified daily pattern for multi-day forecasts"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with clear step-by-step logic. Focuses on heuristic methods rather than complex statistical models due to data limitations, with thorough validation of assumptions about seasonality and trends.",
