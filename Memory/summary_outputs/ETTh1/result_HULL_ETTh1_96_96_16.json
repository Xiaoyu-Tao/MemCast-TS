  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to short-term time-series forecasting for hourly transformer load data. It emphasizes handling data constraints (limited 4-day history) by selecting a simple, interpretable method after evaluating alternatives. The analysis prioritizes daily seasonality detection, justifies method selection due to data limitations, and includes detailed computational steps with value rounding for consistency.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Complete data in provided block (no missing values)",
    "Potential slight downward trend (deemed insignificant for forecasting)",
    "Consistent 3-decimal precision in input data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of simplicity for short historical data (4 days) over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Use of same-hour averaging across multiple days to capture seasonality",
    "Explicit rounding of forecasts to match input data precision",
    "Repetition of averaged daily pattern for multi-day forecasts",
    "Verification of timestamp continuity in output generation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of alternatives, detailed seasonal pattern analysis, and manual computation, but ultimately implemented through simple averaging due to data constraints.",
