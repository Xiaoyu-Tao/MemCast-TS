  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach for forecasting hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst works with a short historical window (96 hours) and prioritizes simplicity to avoid overfitting, ultimately selecting a simple averaging method per hour across available days. The approach includes thorough data inspection, consideration of alternatives like SARIMA and exponential smoothing, and addresses potential challenges like missing values and weekly patterns despite data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Lower nighttime values and daytime peaks",
    "Weekend vs. weekday variations (lower values on weekends)",
    "Midday value drops on specific days",
    "No significant long-term trend"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritize simplicity for short datasets to prevent overfitting",
    "Leverage dominant daily patterns via hourly averaging when weekly data is insufficient",
    "Explicitly handle data formatting and rounding consistency in outputs",
    "Address missing values in methodology even if absent in current data",
    "Validate patterns through spot-checks of key timestamps"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition, method comparison (SARIMA, exponential smoothing), and detailed implementation with manual calculations, though the final method is computationally simple.",
