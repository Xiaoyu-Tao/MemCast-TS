  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a simple yet effective heuristic method. It focuses on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) by identifying and leveraging daily seasonality patterns. The approach emphasizes robustness against potential missing values, though none were present in the given data, and prioritizes computational simplicity given the limited history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)",
    "Recurring intraday patterns (e.g., peaks at specific hours)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity for short datasets: Complex models like SARIMA are avoided due to insufficient historical data",
    "Hourly averaging as a seasonality-capture mechanism: Grouping data by hour across days to compute mean values",
    "Pattern repetition for multi-step forecasts: Reusing the computed 24-hour profile for all future days",
    "Timestamp handling: Precise generation of future dates with hourly intervals",
    "Data completeness verification: Explicit check for missing values before processing"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong heuristic focus. Involves data pattern analysis, grouped statistical calculations, and systematic future timestamp generation, but avoids advanced modeling due to data constraints.",
