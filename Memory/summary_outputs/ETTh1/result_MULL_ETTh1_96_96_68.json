  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling limited data (96 points) and anomalies. It prioritizes simplicity by leveraging observable daily patterns while explicitly addressing data anomalies (e.g., a constant-value day). The method emphasizes data completeness and timestamp generation, with calculations tailored to the dataset's hourly frequency and value ranges.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous data (constant-value day) from pattern calculations",
    "Preference for recent data (last two normal days) over full history for pattern extraction",
    "Explicit handling of timestamp generation for multi-day forecasts",
    "Rounding conventions matching input data precision",
    "Acknowledgment of limitations in modeling trends or weekly seasonality due to short data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong practical adaptations: Combines data quality checks, anomaly handling, and pattern-based heuristics. Avoids advanced statistical models (e.g., SARIMA) due to data constraints, opting for interpretable averaging techniques instead.",
