  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst initially considers advanced models like Holt-Winters and SARIMA but defaults to a simple averaging method due to computational constraints. Key strengths include thorough data pattern recognition and step-by-step justification, though the approach is ultimately a pragmatic baseline solution.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Complete data (no missing values in provided points)",
    "Summer seasonal consistency (August data)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns dominate the time-series structure, making hourly averaging a viable baseline approach",
    "Short data history (96 points) limits complex model application to avoid overfitting",
    "Data stationarity assumed due to absence of clear trend in the observation window",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity and formatting for output consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial reasoning (model comparisons, seasonality analysis) that simplifies to practical implementation. Features detailed data decomposition and manual calculations but ultimately relies on elementary averaging due to execution constraints.",
