  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on handling hourly data with potential missing values. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, considers advanced models like SARIMA but defaults to a simple averaging heuristic due to computational limitations. The method prioritizes generating a complete forecast quickly, acknowledging its limitations while providing a baseline solution.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis (considering SARIMA/seasonality) that simplifies to heuristic implementation. Balances statistical concepts with practical constraints, featuring multi-step data examination but ultimately applying straightforward averaging due to execution limitations.",
