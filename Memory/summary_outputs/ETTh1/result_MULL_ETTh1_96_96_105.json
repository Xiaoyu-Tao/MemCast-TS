  "overall_summary": "The forecasting approach utilized a simple averaging method to handle hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The reasoning identified consistent daily patterns but no clear long-term trend, opting for a practical solution under computational constraints by averaging each hour across four historical days and repeating this pattern. The method prioritized simplicity and data completeness while acknowledging potential limitations in trend capture.",
