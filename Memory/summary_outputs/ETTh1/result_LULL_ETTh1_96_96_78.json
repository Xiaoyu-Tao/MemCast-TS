  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, methodical approach to time-series data with limited history (96 hourly observations). It focuses on handling short data spans and anomalies through robust statistical methods, emphasizing daily seasonality and anomaly mitigation. The analysis is thorough, considering multiple modeling options before selecting a median-based pattern replication approach for forecasting.",

  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomaly detection (unexpected drops/pattern shifts)",
    "Complete data (no missing values in historical data)",
    "Time-of-day variations (night vs. value fluctuations)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) necessitates simple, robust methods over complex models",
    "Median-based pattern replication mitigates anomalies by aggregating hourly data across days",
    "Explicit handling of potential day-of-week effects despite insufficient data for separate modeling",
    "Step-by-step computation of hourly medians to derive a representative daily pattern"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step statistical analysis, anomaly evaluation, and detailed pattern computation, though constrained by limited historical data.",
