  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for a heuristic averaging method over complex models due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The analysis thoroughly considers data characteristics like missing value potential and diurnal patterns while emphasizing forecast completeness.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily pattern extraction through hourly aggregation",
    "Explicit handling of data limitations (4-day history) justifying simple methods",
    "Robustness against missing values via averaging (though not encountered)",
    "Consistent rounding to match input data format (3 decimals)",
    "Date sequence generation aligned with forecast horizon requirements"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with strong heuristic focus. Avoids complex statistical methods due to data constraints, instead leveraging intuitive pattern recognition and arithmetic operations for transparent forecasting.",
