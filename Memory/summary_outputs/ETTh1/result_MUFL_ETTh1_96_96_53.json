  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a robust approach to time-series forecasting that prioritizes handling data anomalies and limited data constraints. It begins by considering advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately adopts a heuristic method due to the presence of a constant-value anomaly in the dataset. The solution focuses on anomaly detection, data imputation via exclusion, and a median-based daily profile adjusted for recent levels, ensuring practicality given the small sample size.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Anomaly exclusion: Treating constant-value data as unreliable and excluding it from base pattern calculations",
    "Robust daily profiling: Using hourly medians from non-anomalous days to capture recurring patterns",
    "Level adjustment: Applying additive corrections based on the last day's average to account for recent trends",
