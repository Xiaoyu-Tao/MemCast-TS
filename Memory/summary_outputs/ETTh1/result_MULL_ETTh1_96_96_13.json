  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging to handle daily seasonality. It considers advanced models like SARIMA and Holt-Winters but defaults to a heuristic method due to implementation constraints. The analysis effectively identifies patterns but acknowledges limitations like weekend variability and data's short history.",
