  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality. Given the constraint of only 4 days of hourly data, the model prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex statistical methods. It systematically evaluates alternative approaches (Seasonal Naive, Holt-Winters, SARIMA) before selecting an hourly averaging method due to data limitations. The analysis includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and careful computation, resulting in a seasonally-adjusted forecast.",
