  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed, step-by-step approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It identifies daily seasonality and data anomalies, evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, exponential smoothing), and selects a robust median-based heuristic due to data constraints. The solution pragmatically handles outliers and unknown weekly patterns by repeating a median daily cycle.",
