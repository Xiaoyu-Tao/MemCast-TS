  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a comprehensive approach to time-series forecasting, focusing on identifying patterns, handling data constraints, and selecting appropriate methods. It emphasizes decomposition techniques to address seasonality and trend components, with detailed manual calculations due to the absence of code execution. The analysis shows strong pattern recognition but highlights challenges with limited data (only 4 days).",
