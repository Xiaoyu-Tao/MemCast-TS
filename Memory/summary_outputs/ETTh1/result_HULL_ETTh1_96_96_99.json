  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96-hour hourly data using a 4-day history. The analyst considered multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but ultimately selected a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. Key strengths include thorough seasonality analysis, data completeness checks, and consideration of negative values. The approach prioritizes simplicity and robustness given the limited historical data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Stable hourly patterns with proportional variation",
    "Presence of negative values",
    "No missing values in the provided segment",
    "Possible slight upward trend (deemed insignificant for modeling)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) favors simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Negative values necessitate additive (not multiplicative) seasonality handling",
    "Hourly averaging provides robustness against limited trend visibility",
    "Data grouping by hour effectively captures daily seasonal patterns",
    "Precision maintenance (3 decimal places) ensures output consistency with input"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines statistical model consideration with practical simplification. Includes data diagnostics (trend/seasonality assessment), method comparison, and step-by-step computation, but ultimately implements a straightforward heuristic solution.",
