  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical median-based heuristic approach to handle outliers and suspected daily seasonality in short-term hourly data. It demonstrates robust pattern extraction through hourly medians while acknowledging limitations in trend detection and model sophistication due to the constrained 4-day dataset. The method prioritizes outlier resistance over complex modeling given data limitations.",
