  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It begins by assessing data completeness and identifying key patterns, then evaluates multiple modeling approaches before selecting a robust heuristic method to handle outliers and seasonality. The analysis shows strong pattern recognition but simplifies complexity due to data constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Time-of-day patterns (lower nighttime, higher daytime/evening values)",
    "Outlier detection (e.g., spike at 2017-07-19 00:00)",
    "Consistent hourly load patterns across days",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simpler methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Median-based approach effectively mitigates outlier impact while preserving daily patterns",
    "Repeating median hourly values for forecast horizon provides stability",
    "Additive seasonality assumed due to consistent amplitude in daily patterns",
    "Data constraints make trend detection unreliable, favoring pattern repetition"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Detailed initial consideration of advanced models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) followed by simplification to heuristic methods due to data limitations and practical constraints.",
