  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach focused on handling short-term time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The forecaster prioritizes simplicity and robustness due to limited historical points (96 hours), opting for a straightforward averaging method over complex models. Key considerations include identifying diurnal patterns, checking for missing values, and addressing potential day-of-week effects despite insufficient history for weekly seasonality. The solution is pragmatic, emphasizing computational feasibility and interpretability.",
