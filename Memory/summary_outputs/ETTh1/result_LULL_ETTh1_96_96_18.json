  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, exploring multiple methods before selecting a heuristic solution. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, handling potential missing values, and justifying method selection based on data characteristics. The reasoning is thorough but constrained by the short time series.",

    "Short time series (4 days) limits complex model application due to over-parameterization risks",
