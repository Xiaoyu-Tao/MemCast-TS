  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory focuses on forecasting 96 hourly LULL values using a 4-day historical dataset. The approach emphasizes handling daily seasonality and data limitations, evaluating multiple methods before selecting a practical solution. The analysis is systematic, considering patterns, missing values, and computational feasibility, but constrained by the short data history.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent negative values with 3-decimal precision",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Limited data for weekly pattern detection"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritized simplicity due to short data (4 days), ruling out complex models like SARIMA",
    "Used hour-of-day averaging to handle seasonality, repeating the pattern for the forecast horizon",
    "Addressed rounding conventions (3 decimals) to match input data format",
    "Evaluated and rejected seasonal naive methods due to over-simplification concerns"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Detailed pattern analysis and multi-method evaluation, but simplified implementation due to data constraints. Focused on practical computations (hourly averages) over statistical modeling.",
