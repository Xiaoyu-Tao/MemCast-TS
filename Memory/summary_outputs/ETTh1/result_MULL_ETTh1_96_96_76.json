{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and ultimately implements a custom per-hour linear regression method due to data constraints. The solution emphasizes trend capture and seasonality handling while acknowledging limitations of the 4-day dataset.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly data requires explicit modeling of daily seasonality (24-period cycles)",
    "Linear regression per hour effectively captures intra-day trend evolution",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simple, explainable methods over complex models",
    "Manual implementation is required when external libraries are unavailable"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical reasoning: involves data decomposition, model comparison, and manual implementation of regression calculations for each hourly segment across 4 forecast days.",
