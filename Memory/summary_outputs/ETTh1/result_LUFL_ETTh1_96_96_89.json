  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on handling short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity to avoid overfitting, opting for a straightforward hourly averaging method after considering but dismissing more complex models like SARIMA/ETS due to limited data. Key steps include pattern identification, data validation, and practical implementation with rounding for consistency.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Low nighttime values with morning/evening peaks",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity (e.g., hourly averaging) over complex models when historical data is limited (only 4 days)",
    "Explicit handling of data granularity through rounding forecasts to match input precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Acknowledgment of unattainable weekly seasonality due to insufficient historical coverage",
    "Robust generation of continuous forecasts despite potential future missing values in source data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong practical simplifications. The reasoning includes multi-step validation (pattern checks, model comparisons) but deliberately simplifies implementation to a scalable averaging heuristic due to data constraints.",
