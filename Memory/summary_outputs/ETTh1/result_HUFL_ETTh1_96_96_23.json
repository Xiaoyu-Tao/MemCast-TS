  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and leveraging simple averaging due to limited data. The analyst considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but defaults to a heuristic method (hourly averaging) because of the simulated environment's inability to run code. The approach prioritizes capturing daily patterns while acknowledging limitations in trend detection.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Stable hourly patterns with minor daily variations"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, with consistent hourly fluctuations across days",
    "Limited data (96 points) restricts complex modeling, favoring heuristic methods",
    "Forecasts replicate averaged daily patterns without trend adjustment due to insufficient trend visibility",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input formatting",
    "Identical daily patterns are projected forward for multi-day forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Starts with advanced model considerations (SARIMA/Exponential Smoothing) but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data and environmental constraints. Includes detailed data observation and step-by-step calculations.",
