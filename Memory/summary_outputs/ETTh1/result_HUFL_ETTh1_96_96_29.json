  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to multi-step time-series forecasting using limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity and practicality by selecting a heuristic-based method (hourly averaging) over complex models due to data constraints. The process includes data inspection, pattern recognition, method selection, computation, and output generation, with a focus on handling seasonality and ensuring complete forecasts despite potential missing values.",
