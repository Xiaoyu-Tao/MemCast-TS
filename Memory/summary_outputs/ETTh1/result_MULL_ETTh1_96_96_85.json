  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 hours of hourly time-series data using a limited 4-day historical dataset. The analyst systematically evaluates data characteristics, considers multiple modeling approaches, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The process includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and step-by-step computation, resulting in a practical solution that prioritizes robustness over complexity given the short history.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal variation)",
    "Non-constant variance",
    "Potential outliers (e.g., 0.000 value)",
    "Lack of clear long-term trend"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (only 4 days) restricts complex model application (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)",
    "Hourly averaging effectively handles daily seasonality when historical cycles are limited",
    "Outliers are incorporated but mitigated through averaging",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Date handling ensures continuous hourly sequencing in output"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Initial consideration of advanced methods followed by implementation of simple heuristics due to limited data. Includes detailed data decomposition, pattern analysis, and step-by-step computational validation.",
