  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a limited 4-day hourly dataset. It identifies strong daily seasonality as the dominant pattern and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach is pragmatic, focusing on robustness and computational simplicity while acknowledging limitations like insufficient data for weekly seasonality modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Higher load during evening hours",
    "Lower load during early morning hours",
    "Day-to-day variation without clear trend",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns are forecasted by averaging same-hour values across the last 4 days",
    "Limited data prevents trend analysis and weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Forecast repeats identical daily patterns due to absence of discernible trend",
    "Rounding to 3 decimals maintains consistency with original data precision",
    "Robustness to potential missing values is considered despite complete historical data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern examination and step-by-step computation, but relies on heuristic methods rather than advanced statistical models due to data limitations.",
