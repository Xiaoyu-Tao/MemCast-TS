  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analytical approach for short-term hourly forecasting using limited 4-day dataset. It focuses on handling data constraints, evaluating multiple models, and implementing a decomposition-based method to capture daily seasonality while acknowledging limitations like insufficient data for weekly patterns.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Statistical Decomposition": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided points)",
    "Hourly volatility with peak variations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model application (SARIMA/ETS)",
    "Seasonal indices derived from hourly averages minus global mean",
    "Last day's average used as base level for forecasts",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week transitions despite data limitations",
    "Manual data validation through point-by-point aggregation"
