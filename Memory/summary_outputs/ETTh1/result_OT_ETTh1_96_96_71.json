  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analytical process for forecasting hourly oil temperature data. It begins by assessing data completeness and seasonality, evaluates advanced models like SARIMA and exponential smoothing, but ultimately adopts a heuristic approach due to data limitations (only 4 days of history). The method focuses on per-hour average daily changes applied to the last observed day, with explicit consideration of volatility and practical constraints.",
