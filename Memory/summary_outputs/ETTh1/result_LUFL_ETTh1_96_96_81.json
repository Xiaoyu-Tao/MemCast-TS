  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a robust heuristic approach for short-term forecasting with limited data. It prioritizes handling outliers and potential seasonality by using a median-based seasonal naive method, explicitly rejecting more complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing due to data constraints. The analysis includes detailed data inspection, outlier identification, and step-by-step computation of hourly medians.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Potential daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Outlier presence (e.g., extreme low values at specific hours)",
    "No missing values in provided history",
    "Limited data length (96 hours/4 days)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median-based aggregation preferred over mean to mitigate outlier influence",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to insufficient data for trend detection",
    "Repetition of 24-hour median pattern for multi-day forecasting",
    "Data rounding to match input precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Hourly alignment crucial for seasonal pattern capture"
