  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes handling data constraints, identifies daily seasonality, and selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The approach includes thorough data validation, pattern recognition, and practical implementation with clear justifications for method selection.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Absence of missing values in historical data",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "Lack of discernible trend due to short history"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data history (4 days) limits model selection, favoring simple methods over SARIMA/ETS",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily patterns when weekly seasonality can't be modeled",
    "Data validation precedes modeling (checking for missing values, frequency alignment)",
    "Forecast replication requires consistent daily patterns despite differing weekday contexts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: begins with advanced model consideration (SARIMA/ETS), transitions to practical heuristics after evaluating data limitations, and includes detailed manual computations for pattern extraction.",
