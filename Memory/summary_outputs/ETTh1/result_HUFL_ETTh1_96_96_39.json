  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analysis of a time-series forecasting problem with significant data challenges, particularly a prolonged period of zeros interpreted as missing values or system shutdown. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple modeling approaches before settling on a heuristic pattern-scaling method. The reasoning is thorough, addressing data preprocessing, model selection trade-offs, and practical implementation constraints, though it reveals challenges in handling structural breaks with limited data.",
