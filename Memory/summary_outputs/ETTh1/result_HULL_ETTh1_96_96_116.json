  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It identifies daily seasonality and a downward trend but prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints. The analysis evaluates multiple methods (seasonal naive, exponential smoothing, ARIMA) before settling on simple averaging per hour across days, avoiding complex trend adjustments that produced unrealistic projections. The reasoning is thorough, data-driven, and transparent about limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Downward trend in daily averages",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model application and trend reliability",
    "Simple averaging per hour across historical data effectively captures baseline seasonality without overfitting",
    "Linear trend projections can yield unrealistic results (e.g., negative values) with short time series",
    "Hourly pattern repetition is preferred over trend-adjusted forecasts when data is sparse and volatile"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: data inspection, method comparison, daily/hourly aggregation, trend modeling, and robustness evaluation. Balances statistical rigor with practical simplicity due to data constraints.",
