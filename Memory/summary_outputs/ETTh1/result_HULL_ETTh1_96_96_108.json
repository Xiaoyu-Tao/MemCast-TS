  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. It emphasizes identifying patterns, evaluating multiple methods, and selecting a simple yet effective averaging technique due to data constraints. The analysis thoroughly considers seasonality, data completeness, and practical implementation details while acknowledging potential limitations like missing values and trends.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Negative value fluctuations in afternoons",
    "No missing values in provided dataset",
    "Variable hourly patterns across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern requiring explicit modeling",
    "Short data history (96 points) limits complex model applicability",
    "Hourly averaging provides stability when daily patterns are inconsistent",
    "Rounding conventions must match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Missing value handling should be incorporated despite absence in current data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern examination and multi-method evaluation, though implementation uses straightforward calculations due to data limitations. Includes statistical considerations and practical data handling.",
