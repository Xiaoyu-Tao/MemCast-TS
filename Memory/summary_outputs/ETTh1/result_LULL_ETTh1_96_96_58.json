  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on handling daily seasonality with simple averaging due to limited data (96 points). It prioritizes interpretability over complex models, using a 4-day hourly average to forecast the next 96 hours. Data completeness and stationarity assumptions are explicitly validated.",

    "Identified and leveraged daily seasonality as the dominant pattern",
    "Used 4-day hourly averages to address limited training data constraints",
    "Explicitly verified data completeness despite system warnings about potential missing values",
