  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a practical approach focused on daily seasonality and data limitations. Given only 4 days of hourly data, the analysis prioritizes simplicity over complex models, selecting a simple averaging method that smooths hourly patterns across available days. The solution acknowledges potential trends and model limitations but opts for reliability given the short history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Short data length (96 points) prevents reliable use of SARIMA/ETS models",
