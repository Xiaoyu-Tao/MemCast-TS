  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 hourly values using a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (4 days). Daily seasonality was identified but found inconsistent, leading to a decision to compute hourly averages across available days and repeat this pattern. The analysis emphasized handling potential missing values (though none existed in the input), rounding precision, and evaluating model choices like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing before opting for simplicity.",
