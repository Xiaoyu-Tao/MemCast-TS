  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality in hourly data, prioritizing practicality given limited historical data (4 days). While acknowledging potential methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, it rejects them due to insufficient seasonal cycles. The approach focuses on hourly pattern replication through historical averaging, explicitly addressing data completeness constraints and ignoring trends/weekly patterns due to limited scope.",
