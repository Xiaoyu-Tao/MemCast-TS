  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns in limited historical data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes handling seasonality and data completeness while selecting a simple, explainable method due to short history constraints. The analysis is logical but constrained by the small dataset, leading to heuristic solutions rather than complex models.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Reshaping data into 4x24 matrices for hourly average calculations",
    "Explicit consideration of calendar effects (weekdays vs weekends) despite data limitations",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity with strong emphasis on data preprocessing and heuristic adaptation. The reasoning involves multi-step analytical checks (seasonality detection, trend analysis, calendar considerations) but defaults to simple averaging due to data constraints, avoiding advanced statistical modeling.",
