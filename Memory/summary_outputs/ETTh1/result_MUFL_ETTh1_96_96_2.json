  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritized simplicity and interpretability by selecting a straightforward averaging method over complex models due to the small dataset size (96 points), while systematically addressing data patterns, potential missing values, and precision requirements.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Peak load during daytime, low load at night",
    "Variable peak magnitudes across days",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns dominate the time series, making hourly averaging effective",
    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model application (e.g., SARIMA/ETS)",
    "Most recent day's anomalies should be smoothed via multi-day averaging",
    "Precision alignment (rounding to 3 decimals) maintains consistency with input data",
    "Date-aware structuring ensures correct forecast sequence alignment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with methodical pattern analysis and computational rigor. Balances statistical reasoning (seasonality identification, averaging trade-offs) with practical constraints, avoiding over-engineering while ensuring traceable calculations and data integrity checks.",
