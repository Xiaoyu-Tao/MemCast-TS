  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data with strong daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and computational efficiency, opting for a heuristic method over complex models due to data limitations. The analysis thoroughly considers alternatives, validates data completeness, and includes detailed step-by-step calculations while maintaining awareness of potential limitations like missing values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Hourly data granularity",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in sample)",
    "Potential non-stationarity (noted but not explicitly modeled)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Utilization of same-hour averaging across multiple days to capture daily seasonality",
    "Explicit consideration of data limitations (only 4 days of history) when selecting methodology",
    "Rounding protocol alignment with original data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Rejection of complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to insufficient data length",
    "Pattern repetition for multi-day forecasting without trend extrapolation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed computational steps: includes method comparison, per-hour calculations, and datetime handling, but relies on fundamental heuristics rather than advanced statistical models. Balances analytical depth with practical constraints.",
