  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analytical process for forecasting hourly oil temperature data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks data completeness, and evaluates multiple forecasting methods before selecting a simple averaging approach due to computational constraints. The reasoning is thorough but ultimately relies on heuristic pattern repetition without trend adjustment, prioritizing practicality given the limited data and text-based environment.",
