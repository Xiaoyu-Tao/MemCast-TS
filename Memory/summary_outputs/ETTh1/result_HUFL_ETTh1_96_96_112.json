  "key_insights": [
    "Recognition of daily seasonality as the dominant pattern for forecasting",
    "Preference for simple methods (e.g., hourly averaging) over complex models when data is limited",
    "Explicit handling of data formatting and rounding to match input specifications",
    "Verification of data completeness before forecasting"
