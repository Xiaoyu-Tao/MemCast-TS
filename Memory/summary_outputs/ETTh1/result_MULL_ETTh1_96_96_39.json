  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed, methodical approach to handling a time-series with significant missing values (prolonged zero periods). The analyst systematically evaluates data patterns, considers multiple imputation and forecasting strategies, and navigates ambiguity regarding zero-value interpretation. The process emphasizes practical solutions given data limitations, culminating in a pattern-based forecasting approach.",

    "Daily seasonality",
    "Prolonged zero values (interpreted as missing data)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Zeros require contextual interpretation—either as valid measurements (equipment failure) or missing data requiring imputation",
    "First complete day (2016-12-04) serves as the primary template for pattern extraction",
    "Hourly averaging of non-zero values forms the basis for handling sparse data",
    "Forecasting relies on repeating identified daily patterns due to insufficient historical data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis involving data validation, pattern decomposition, missing value imputation strategies, and iterative model evaluation under uncertainty.",
