  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to short-term forecasting with limited data, focusing on daily seasonality identification and simple averaging methods. It emphasizes data constraints (only 4 days of history) and prioritizes straightforward, implementable solutions over complex models while maintaining output formatting precision.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern for hourly data forecasting",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex model applicability",
    "Simple averaging per hour across days provides a feasible baseline approach",
    "Forecast horizon alignment (96 hours = 4 days) enables pattern repetition",
    "Data rounding and timestamp generation require meticulous implementation"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Balances data pattern analysis with practical constraints. Includes method comparisons (seasonal naive, exponential smoothing), detailed data decomposition, and computational steps, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations.",
