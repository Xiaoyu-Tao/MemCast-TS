  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to hourly time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 points). After evaluating multiple methods, the analyst selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints, focusing on daily seasonality while acknowledging but not modeling a potential downward trend. The solution prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex modeling given the 4-day forecast horizon.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Potential downward trend (not modeled due to limited data)",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Higher daytime values and lower nighttime values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling of trends or weekly patterns",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant identifiable pattern",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days provides a robust baseline",
    "Forecast horizon matches historical data length (96 hours), enabling pattern repetition",
    "Output formatting consistency (3 decimal places) maintains data integrity"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Involves method evaluation (SARIMA/ETS/seasonal naive), data decomposition considerations, and trend analysis, but implements a simple, justifiable solution due to data limitations.",
