  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited data (96 hourly points), using a straightforward averaging method while acknowledging potential data quality concerns. The process includes clear pattern recognition, method justification, detailed computation, and output formatting.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Consistent hourly load fluctuations (dips at 8-9 AM, nightly rises)",
    "Complete data in provided window (no missing values)",
    "Fixed decimal precision requirement (3 decimal places)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Reshaping data into 4x24 matrices for hourly averaging across days",
    "Explicit handling of datetime formatting and sequence generation",
    "Rounding strategy aligned with original data precision",
    "Repeating daily profiles for multi-day forecasts",
    "Acknowledgment of method limitations with small datasets"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with structured multi-step analysis. Combines data inspection, pattern identification, arithmetic computation, and output validation, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
