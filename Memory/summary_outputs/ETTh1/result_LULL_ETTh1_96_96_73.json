  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a systematic approach focused on daily seasonality and simple averaging methods. The analysis emphasizes stability through hourly averaging across available days while acknowledging limitations of short data horizons and potential weekly patterns. Method selection shows practical prioritization of robustness over complexity given the 4-day dataset.",
