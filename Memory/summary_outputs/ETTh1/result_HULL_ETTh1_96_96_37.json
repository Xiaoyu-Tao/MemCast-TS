  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a methodical approach focused on handling short-term hourly data with potential daily seasonality. The analysis prioritizes simplicity due to limited historical data (4 days), opting for a straightforward averaging method to capture daily patterns while acknowledging but not fully addressing potential trends. The solution emphasizes practical implementation with clear data grouping and pattern repetition for forecasting.",

    "Hourly averaging across multiple days effectively captures daily patterns for short-term forecasts",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with systematic evaluation of multiple approaches (seasonal naive, ETS, ARIMA) before settling on simple averaging. Includes data inspection, trend consideration, and implementation planning, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations.",
