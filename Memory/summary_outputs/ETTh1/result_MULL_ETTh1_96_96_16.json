  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst systematically evaluates methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. Key considerations include daily seasonality, potential weekday/weekend patterns, outlier impacts, and data recency. The solution prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex modeling given the small dataset.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Weekday-weekend pattern variations",
    "Outlier detection (e.g., spike on 2016-09-05)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Recency-based data selection"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model application",
    "Recent 3 days' hourly averages preferred over full history for pattern capture",
    "Averaging smooths outliers but maintains daily seasonality structure",
    "Same daily pattern repeated for multi-day forecasts due to trend uncertainty",
    "Explicit exclusion of older data (Day 1) based on weekday relevance"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of statistical methods, but ultimately employs simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes multi-step pattern analysis, outlier consideration, and practical trade-off decisions.",
