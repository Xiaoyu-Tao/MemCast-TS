  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach for short-term forecasting using simple averaging and decomposition methods. It effectively identifies daily seasonality but acknowledges data limitations (only 4 days) that prevent complex modeling. The approach is pragmatic, focusing on basic arithmetic operations for decomposition and pattern repetition, though it lacks advanced statistical techniques.",
