  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series analysis with limited historical data (96 hourly points). The model prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, carefully evaluating seasonality patterns and day-of-week effects before selecting a straightforward averaging method. The process includes thorough data inspection, consideration of multiple forecasting techniques, and attention to output formatting.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Prioritizing simplicity when historical data is limited (4 days)",
    "Explicit consideration of day-of-week mismatches between historical and forecast periods",
    "Hourly averaging as a fallback when same-day references are unavailable",
    "Data rounding to maintain consistency with input precision",
    "Rejection of complex models (e.g., ARIMA) due to insufficient data points"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step evaluation of alternatives, but ultimately implements simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes seasonality analysis, pattern recognition, and method comparison before execution.",
