  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data sequences with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to limited data (96 hourly points), identifying a 24-hour pattern as the dominant feature. Method selection emphasizes interpretability over complexity, with explicit consideration of data limitations and missing value handling despite their absence in this case.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary driver for forecasting with limited data",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across available days provides a robust baseline",
    "Data limitations (4 days) preclude complex models like SARIMA or exponential smoothing",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for multi-day forecasting horizons",
    "Rounding conventions must match input data specifications (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition with practical model selection trade-offs. Includes step-by-step validation of assumptions (trend analysis, missing values) and detailed computational implementation, but avoids advanced statistical methods due to data constraints.",
