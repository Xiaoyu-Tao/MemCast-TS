  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process involved validating data completeness, identifying daily seasonality (24-hour cycles), and considering advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing. Due to limited historical data (4 days), the analysis pivoted to a heuristic approach using hourly averages from past days. The method prioritized simplicity and pattern repetition, acknowledging data constraints while ensuring forecast completeness.",
