  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory focuses on forecasting 96 future hourly data points using a limited 4-day historical dataset. The approach prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, identifying strong daily seasonality but insufficient data for weekly patterns or complex modeling. After evaluating SARIMA and exponential smoothing, the model adopts a simple hourly averaging method as the most feasible solution given the small sample size and inconsistent daily patterns.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher nighttime values with daytime drops",
    "Inconsistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (96 points) restricts complex model application",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant identifiable pattern",
    "Inconsistent hourly trends make moving averages or complex models impractical",
    "Hourly averaging provides stability when daily patterns vary significantly",
    "Forecast horizon equals historical data length, necessitating pattern repetition"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Initial consideration of advanced models (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) followed by step-by-step validation of data constraints, detailed pattern analysis, and manual computation of hourly averages, but ultimately reverting to a simple heuristic approach.",
