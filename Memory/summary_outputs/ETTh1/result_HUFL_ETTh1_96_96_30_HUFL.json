  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple heuristics focused on daily seasonality. It effectively handles data anomalies by excluding an entire constant-value day from pattern calculations, opting for a straightforward hourly averaging method across valid days. The solution prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex modeling due to limited historical data.",
