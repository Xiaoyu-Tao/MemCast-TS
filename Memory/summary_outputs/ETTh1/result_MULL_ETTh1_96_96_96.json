  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying seasonality patterns and handling data constraints, ultimately selecting a simple averaging method due to insufficient historical data for more sophisticated modeling. The solution prioritizes robustness over complexity, acknowledging challenges like missing value handling and day-of-week variations while providing a complete forecast.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Day-of-week variations (Thursday to Sunday patterns)",
    "Handling of potential missing values",

  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern when weekly data is unavailable",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days provides a viable baseline for short-term forecasts",
    "Limited historical observations (4 days) restrict the use of advanced models like ETS or weekly seasonality capture",
    "Forecast rounding must match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Day-of-week mismatches (e.g., no Monday history) necessitate simplified approaches"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: involves seasonality identification, multi-method consideration (ETS, seasonal naive), and detailed hourly computations, but simplifies to averaging due to limited data scope.",
