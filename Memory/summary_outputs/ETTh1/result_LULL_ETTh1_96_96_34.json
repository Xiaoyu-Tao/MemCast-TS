  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focuses on identifying daily seasonality patterns while handling limited data (4 days) and inconsistent initial patterns. The analyst prioritizes simplicity by using a 3-day hourly average approach after determining the first day's negative values represent an anomaly. The method demonstrates pragmatic adaptation to data limitations through pattern recognition and basic statistical aggregation.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with systematic pattern examination and method comparison, ultimately selecting a simple averaging approach after considering alternatives like seasonal naive methods and trend analysis. Includes detailed hourly pattern verification but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
