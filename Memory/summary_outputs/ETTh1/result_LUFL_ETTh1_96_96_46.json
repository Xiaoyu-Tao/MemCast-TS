  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, focusing on clear daily seasonality while acknowledging the inability to capture weekly patterns. After evaluating SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, the solution adopts a simple averaging method to generate forecasts, emphasizing data completeness and format consistency.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Hourly fluctuations (higher daytime values, lower nighttime values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling and prevents weekly seasonality capture",
    "Daily patterns dominate and can be effectively modeled through hourly averaging",
    "Trend adjustment is unnecessary due to inconsistent short-term trends",
    "Forecast horizon (96 hours) matches historical period length, enabling pattern repetition",
    "Output formatting requires strict adherence to datetime structure and 3-decimal precision"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning: Evaluates advanced models (SARIMA, Holt-Winters) but defaults to simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes detailed data examination, method comparison, and step-by-step implementation logic.",
