  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short-term forecasting with limited data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and data completeness as key characteristics, then selects a simple averaging method due to insufficient data for complex models. The approach prioritizes robustness over sophistication, using hourly pattern repetition while acknowledging limitations like weekday/weekend variations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly pattern repetition",
    "Complete data (no missing values in provided segment)",
    "Variation in daily amplitude levels"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts model selection, favoring simple methods over complex ones like Holt-Winters or STLF",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days creates a baseline daily profile",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern for the forecast horizon provides consistency",
    "Rounding forecast values to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Explicit handling of date/time sequence generation for output alignment"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications: Detailed pattern analysis and method comparisons lead to a simple implementation due to data constraints. Balances seasonality recognition with pragmatic execution.",
