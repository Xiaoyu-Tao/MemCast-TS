  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging to handle daily seasonality, given limited historical data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while addressing data completeness concerns, though it lacks advanced statistical modeling due to the short observation window.",
