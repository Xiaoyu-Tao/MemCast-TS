  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of a 96-point hourly time series with daily seasonality, focusing on forecasting the next 96 points. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods, acknowledges data constraints (short history, potential missing values), and selects a statistical approach combining trend extrapolation and seasonal decomposition. The reasoning is thorough, methodical, and adapts to observed data patterns while maintaining robustness considerations.",
