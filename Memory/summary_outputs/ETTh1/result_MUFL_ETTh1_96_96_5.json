  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality, evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, exponential smoothing, naive approaches), and selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The solution prioritizes robustness over complexity, focusing on pattern extraction while acknowledging limitations like insufficient weekly seasonality data.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)",
    "Day-of-week variations (weekend vs. weekday patterns)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex modeling and weekly seasonality capture",
    "Daily patterns dominate and can be extracted via hourly averaging",
    "Day-of-week effects are acknowledged but unaddressed due to insufficient historical data",
    "Profile-based forecasting is preferred over trend projection when seasonality is strong",
    "Data completeness verification precedes modeling decisions"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, multi-method evaluation, and practical simplifications tailored to data limitations, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to sample size constraints.",
