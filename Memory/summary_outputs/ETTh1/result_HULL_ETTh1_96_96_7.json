  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 future hourly data points using limited historical data. The analyst identifies data anomalies, considers advanced models like SARIMA and exponential smoothing, but ultimately adopts a simple averaging method due to data constraints. Key strengths include thorough data inspection, anomaly handling, and clear justification for method selection, though the approach is constrained by the short 4-day history.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomalous constant values (2016-07-31 treated as outlier)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Day-of-week variations (weekend vs. weekday patterns)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous constant days from modeling",
    "Use of averaged hourly profiles from non-anomalous days (Fri/Sat/Mon) as baseline",
    "Repetition of daily patterns for multi-day forecasting",
    "Manual computation of hourly averages to handle data limitations",
    "Explicit consideration of day-of-week effects despite insufficient historical data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial advanced model considerations (SARIMA, exponential smoothing) with practical simplification due to data constraints. Features multi-step anomaly detection, manual profile computation, and contextual day-of-week analysis, but avoids statistical modeling due to limited data.",
