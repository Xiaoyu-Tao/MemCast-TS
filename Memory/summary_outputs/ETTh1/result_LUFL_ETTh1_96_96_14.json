  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) with strong daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes pattern recognition over complex modeling due to data limitations, ultimately selecting a simple averaging method. Key considerations include verifying data integrity, evaluating multiple forecasting options, and ensuring complete output generation. The reasoning is thorough but pragmatic, favoring interpretable heuristics given the constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Non-stationarity in time-series",
    "Absence of clear long-term patterns",
    "Handling of missing value expectations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hourly aggregation essential",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex modeling like ARIMA/ETS",
    "Daily averages show no consistent trend, justifying static pattern repetition",
    "Output completeness is prioritized over trend extrapolation",
    "Data rounding (3 decimals) maintains consistency with input formatting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, multi-method evaluation, and step-by-step computations, but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data limitations. Avoids advanced statistical modeling while maintaining rigorous pattern analysis.",
