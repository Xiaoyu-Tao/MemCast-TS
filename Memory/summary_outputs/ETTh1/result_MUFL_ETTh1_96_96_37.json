  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, evaluates but dismisses complex models like SARIMA due to insufficient data, and opts for a simple hourly averaging method. The approach is systematic, including data inspection, pattern recognition, method evaluation, and step-by-step computation, though constrained by the 4-day dataset.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Higher load during early morning (00:00, 07:00-08:00)",
    "Lower load during midday (e.g., hour 12: 4.762)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model application despite observed seasonality",
    "Day-of-week considerations (e.g., Saturday vs. Wednesday patterns) are acknowledged but unactionable due to insufficient samples",
    "Hourly averaging provides robustness against missing values and captures recurring daily patterns",
    "Explicit handling of data inconsistencies during average calculations (e.g., hour 13-14 recalibration)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Includes multi-step evaluation of models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) and data patterns, but ultimately implements a simple heuristic due to data constraints. Features detailed data inspection and computational rigor in hourly averaging.",
