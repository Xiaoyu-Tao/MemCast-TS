  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting short time-series data with daily seasonality. It starts by evaluating advanced methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but simplifies to a heuristic averaging technique due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The solution prioritizes capturing daily patterns through hourly averaging while acknowledging data constraints, resulting in a straightforward but potentially oversimplified forecast that ignores trends and weekly seasonality.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Non-stationarity (varying mean/variance)",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Clear hourly load patterns (peaks and troughs)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex model application",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality when data is limited",
    "Overall data average stabilizes forecasts despite daily fluctuations",
    "Rounding outputs to match original data precision (3 decimals) is critical",
    "Lack of clear trend eliminates need for complex trend projection"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial consideration of statistical models (SARIMA/ETS), but ultimately simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data constraints. Features detailed data examination and manual calculations for pattern extraction.",
