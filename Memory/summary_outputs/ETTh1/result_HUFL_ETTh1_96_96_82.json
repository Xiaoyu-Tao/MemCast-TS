  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes handling daily patterns and data completeness, opting for simple averaging over complex models due to the short history. The method focuses on stability through seasonality-based averaging while acknowledging data limitations and potential missing value challenges.",

  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour periodicity)",
    "Negative values during daytime hours",
    "Hourly value variations across days",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in sample)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods like hourly averaging instead of trend-based models",
    "Daily patterns are stable enough to justify repeating hourly averages for multi-day forecasts",
    "Explicit handling of timestamp alignment and rounding for consistent output formatting",
    "Averaging preferred over naive seasonal repetition for improved stability"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition, method comparison (seasonal naive vs. averaging), and detailed computational steps, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
