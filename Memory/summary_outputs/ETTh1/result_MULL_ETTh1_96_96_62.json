  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short data sequences with daily seasonality. The analyst identifies data patterns, evaluates multiple modeling approaches, and ultimately implements a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The process emphasizes robustness over complexity, with thorough consideration of data characteristics and practical implementation details.",
