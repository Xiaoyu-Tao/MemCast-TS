  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). After evaluating several methods, the analyst selects a naive seasonal forecast due to data constraints, prioritizing simplicity and reproducibility. The approach acknowledges limitations like insufficient data for complex models while systematically addressing seasonality and missing value considerations.",

    "Limited historical data (4 days) restricts complex model application (e.g., SARIMA/ETS)",
    "Naive seasonal methods are practical baselines for short-term forecasts with clear periodicity",
    "Repetition of the last observed day simplifies forecasting when trend adjustment is infeasible",
