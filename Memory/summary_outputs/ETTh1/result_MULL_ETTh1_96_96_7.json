  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive approach to forecasting 96-hour time-series data with identified daily seasonality and an anomalous constant-value day. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple methods, acknowledges data limitations (short history, potential anomalies), and selects a simple averaging technique due to constraints. The process includes thorough data inspection, method comparison, and detailed computation of hourly averages, resulting in a practical solution that prioritizes data integrity over complex modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomalous constant-value day (0.533 across all hours)",
    "Hourly pattern variations across days",
    "Weekend/weekday differentiation considerations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, requiring hour-of-day averaging for forecasts",
    "Short data history (4 days) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Anomalous data points must be included in calculations without domain-driven removal",
    "Forecast horizon length (96 steps) necessitates simple, repeatable pattern projection",
    "Date-aware alignment is critical for hourly data (weekday/weekend considerations)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step evaluation: Includes data pattern analysis, method comparison (SARIMA vs. naive vs. averaging), anomaly handling, and detailed computational steps, but ultimately implements a simple solution due to data constraints.",
