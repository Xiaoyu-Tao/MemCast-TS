  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a median-based seasonal forecasting approach to handle clear daily patterns and outliers in limited data (96 hourly observations). It demonstrates moderate complexity by evaluating multiple statistical models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) before settling on a robust median aggregation method to address anomalies while maintaining hourly seasonality patterns.",

    "Using median instead of mean for hourly aggregation robustly handles outliers",
