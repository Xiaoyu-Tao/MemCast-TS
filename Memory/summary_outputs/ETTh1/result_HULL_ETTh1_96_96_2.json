  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by selecting a daily pattern averaging method over complex models like SARIMA due to the small dataset size (96 points). Key considerations include handling potential missing values, identifying daily seasonality, and addressing data inconsistencies while maintaining computational feasibility.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritize simplicity for small datasets to avoid overfitting complex models",
    "Daily seasonality extraction via hourly averaging is effective for short-term forecasts",
