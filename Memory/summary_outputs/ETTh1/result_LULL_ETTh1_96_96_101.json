  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting short time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and stability over complex models due to limited historical points (96 hours), ultimately selecting a simple averaging method to handle seasonality. The process includes thorough data inspection, method comparison, and detailed computation of hourly patterns, with careful attention to data precision through rounding.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Lower values at night (0.7-0.9) and higher daytime peaks (~1.5)",
    "No clear long-term trend across days",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Preference for simple methods (e.g., hourly averaging) over SARIMA/ETS due to short data length preventing reliable complex model fitting",
    "Use of aggregated hourly averages across multiple days to create a stable 'typical day' pattern",
    "Explicit handling of data precision through rounding to match input decimal places",
    "Repetition of the derived daily pattern to match the forecast horizon (96 hours)",
    "Trade-off analysis between using recent data (responsive but noisy) vs. multi-day averages (stable but less adaptive)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data-driven heuristics and step-by-step statistical computations, while consciously avoiding advanced modeling due to data limitations.",
