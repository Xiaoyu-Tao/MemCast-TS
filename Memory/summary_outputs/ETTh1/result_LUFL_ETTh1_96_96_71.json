  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting with hourly data, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and handling small dataset constraints. The analyst initially considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but opts for a simple averaging method due to limited historical data (only 4 days). The process includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and practical implementation of a seasonal naive forecast with averaging, followed by precise rounding and date generation.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Consistent dual-peak pattern (morning and evening peaks)",
    "No clear trend in short-term data",
    "No missing values in provided dataset"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritizing simplicity over complex models (e.g., SARIMA) when data is limited to avoid overfitting",
    "Using hour-of-day averaging to leverage observed daily seasonality",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Repeating the daily pattern unchanged across forecast horizon due to absence of trend",
    "Validating data completeness before processing"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data observation and practical simplification. Includes multi-step consideration of model trade-offs, detailed pattern analysis, and manual computation, but avoids advanced statistical techniques due to data limitations.",
