  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, identifying daily seasonality as the dominant pattern. After considering advanced models like SARIMA and ETS, they default to a simple averaging method, emphasizing robustness and computational efficiency given the small dataset. The process includes thorough data inspection, method evaluation, and output formatting considerations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Peaks during daytime and lower values at night",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Possible downward trend (not explicitly modeled)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) necessitates simpler methods over complex models like SARIMA/ETS",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality without overfitting",
    "Forecast generation via repetition of computed 24-hour patterns",
    "Rounding outputs to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Explicit handling of datetime formatting for forecast periods"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Starts with advanced model considerations but simplifies to heuristic methods due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation (missing value checks, pattern analysis), computational steps (hourly averaging), and output formatting rigor.",
