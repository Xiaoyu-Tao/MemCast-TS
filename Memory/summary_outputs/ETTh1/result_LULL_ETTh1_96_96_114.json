  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns and selecting practical methods given data constraints. The analyst prioritizes daily seasonality detection, acknowledges potential limitations like insufficient data for weekly patterns, and opts for simple averaging due to implementation feasibility. The reasoning is logical and step-oriented but constrained by the limited historical data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Hourly fluctuations (higher values during day, lower at night)",
    "Potential day-of-week effects (acknowledged but not modeled)",

  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary driver for forecasting decisions",
    "Data limitations (4 days) prevent modeling weekly patterns or trends",
    "Trade-off between complexity and feasibility favors simple methods",
    "Handling of hypothetical missing values is considered but not applied",
    "Forecast relies on historical hour-level averaging for consistency"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step pattern analysis and method evaluation, but simplifies to basic averaging due to data constraints. Balances theoretical considerations (trends, seasonality) with practical implementation limits.",
