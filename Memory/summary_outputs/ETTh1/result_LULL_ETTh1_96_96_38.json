  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple yet effective approach focused on daily seasonality, using a seasonal naive averaging method due to limited historical data (96 points). It prioritizes practicality over complex models, acknowledging constraints like insufficient data for robust SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. The solution emphasizes capturing hourly patterns by averaging corresponding hours across the 4 available days, ensuring computational simplicity and interpretability.",
