  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting a short time series with limited data. The modeler identifies daily seasonality but faces challenges due to insufficient historical data (only 4 weekdays) and lack of weekend patterns. After considering multiple methods, they implement a simple averaging technique as a robust baseline solution, prioritizing simplicity over complex models to avoid overfitting given the data constraints.",

    "Data limitations (only 4 days) restrict modeling of weekly seasonality or day-of-week effects",
