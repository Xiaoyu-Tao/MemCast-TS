  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes simplicity due to the short horizon, focusing on daily seasonality detection while acknowledging potential data issues like missing values. The approach is pragmatic, favoring straightforward averaging over complex models given the data constraints, and includes thorough validation of assumptions and output formatting.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher nighttime variability (21:00-04:00)",
    "Presence of negative values and zeros",
    "Downward trend in specific hours (e.g., hour 0)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple models over complex ones like SARIMA",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",
    "Explicit handling of potential missing values despite none in the current dataset",
    "Data rounding to match original precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Rejection of trend modeling due to insufficient data points"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, pattern recognition, and model selection logic, but relies on simple averaging due to data limitations. Includes multi-step validation of assumptions and detailed output formatting.",
