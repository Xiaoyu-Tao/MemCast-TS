  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analytical process for time-series forecasting with limited data. The approach focuses on identifying patterns, handling data constraints (short history, potential outliers), and selecting an appropriate method. The analyst prioritizes robustness over complexity due to the small dataset (96 hourly points), ultimately implementing a median-based seasonal averaging method with careful consideration of day-of-week effects and outlier mitigation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly pattern variations (low nighttime values, higher daytime peaks)",
    "Potential day-of-week effects (weekday/weekend differences)",
    "Outlier presence (e.g., unusual spikes in hourly data)",
    "Data completeness in provided segment (no missing values)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median-based forecasting provides robustness against outliers compared to mean-based approaches",
    "Limited historical data restricts complex model usage (e.g., SARIMA, Holt-Winters)",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week patterns despite insufficient data for full weekly seasonality modeling",
    "Grouping by hour and computing central tendencies captures fundamental daily cycles",
    "Data inspection at granular level (hour-by-hour across days) reveals pattern inconsistencies"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analytical reasoning: includes data pattern examination, method evaluation, outlier handling, and implementation of a tailored solution. Balances statistical concepts (median robustness) with practical constraints of small datasets.",
