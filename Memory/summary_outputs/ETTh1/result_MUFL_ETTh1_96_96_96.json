  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality and employs simple averaging method due to data constraints, explicitly acknowledging the inability to model weekly patterns or trends. The solution prioritizes robustness over complexity, resulting in a flat daily pattern repeated across forecast days.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

    "Hourly averaging as primary forecasting method for short historical data",

    "Use of unweighted averages despite recognizing potential relevance of recency",
    "Pattern repetition for multi-day forecasts when differentiation isn't feasible"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex reasoning with thorough consideration of alternatives (weighted averages, day-specific patterns) but ultimately implements simple solution due to data limitations. Includes detailed data inspection and step-by-step justification while avoiding advanced statistical models.",
