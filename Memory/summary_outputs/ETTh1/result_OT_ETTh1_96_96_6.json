  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short historical data with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and robustness, selecting a heuristic averaging technique over complex models due to limited data length. The analysis thoroughly addresses data patterns, potential missing values, and output formatting requirements while justifying method selection based on observed trends and seasonality.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "No significant trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided segment)",
    "Hourly temperature fluctuations (night dips, daytime rises)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Grouping by hour and averaging across days effectively captures daily seasonality",
    "Short data length justifies simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Data formatting precision (6 decimal places) is critical for output consistency",
    "Absence of trend validates use of constant seasonal patterns",
    "Method remains robust even with potential missing values through averaging"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with strong heuristic focus. Involves data pattern recognition, method comparison, and computational implementation, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
