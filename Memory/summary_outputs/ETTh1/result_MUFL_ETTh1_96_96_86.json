  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points (96 hours). The analyst identifies daily seasonality and handles outliers through robust statistical methods, ultimately selecting a median-based pattern repetition due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes simplicity and robustness over complex modeling given the short data horizon.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of outliers/extreme values",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median aggregation preferred over mean to mitigate outlier impact",
    "Explicit handling of anomalies (e.g., -13.432 value) through robust statistics",
    "Pattern repetition justified by strong daily seasonality",
    "Trade-off between model complexity (SARIMA/ETS) and data limitations acknowledged",
    "Temporal alignment maintained for hourly forecasts across 4-day horizon"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data diagnostics, method evaluation, and statistical computations with clear justifications for simplicity trade-offs, though avoids advanced modeling due to data constraints.",
