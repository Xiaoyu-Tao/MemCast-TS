  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality and handling constraints like short history and potential missing values. The solution prioritizes simplicity and robustness by selecting a straightforward averaging method over more sophisticated models deemed infeasible due to data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Short-term fluctuations without clear long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data with warnings about potential future missing values",
    "Variation in hourly patterns across days (e.g., higher Saturday values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical data (4 days) prevents complex seasonal modeling like Holt-Winters or weekly pattern detection",
    "Averaging same-hour values across available days effectively smooths noise while preserving daily seasonality",
    "Ignoring weekly seasonality due to insufficient representation of days-of-week in training data",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimals) for consistency",
    "Explicit handling of timestamps to ensure continuous 96-hour output without gaps"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with multi-step analysis: Includes data inspection, method comparison, pattern recognition, and manual calculations, but ultimately selects a simple heuristic due to data constraints. Demonstrates awareness of advanced techniques while pragmatically adapting to limitations.",
