  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process evaluated multiple forecasting approaches (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, seasonal decomposition) but ultimately selected a simple hourly averaging method due to limited data size (96 points) and operational constraints. The final approach calculates hourly averages across 4 historical days and repeats this pattern for the forecast horizon, prioritizing simplicity and explainability over complex modeling.",
