  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using simple averaging to capture daily seasonality. It effectively handles limited historical records (96 hourly points) by focusing on clear daily patterns while acknowledging data constraints like insufficient weekly data. The methodical step-by-step approach ensures transparency, though it remains basic without advanced modeling.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",

    "Leveraging same-hour averages across multiple days to forecast daily seasonality",
    "Explicitly handling data limitations (e.g., insufficient weekly data for weekend patterns)",
