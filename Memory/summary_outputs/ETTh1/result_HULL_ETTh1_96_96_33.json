  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting with limited data (4 days), prioritizing simplicity and robustness over complex models. It initially considers advanced methods like SARIMA but opts for a heuristic-based solution using hourly medians to handle seasonality and outliers, resulting in a clear, repeatable pattern for multi-step forecasts.",

    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model feasibility, favoring simple heuristics",
