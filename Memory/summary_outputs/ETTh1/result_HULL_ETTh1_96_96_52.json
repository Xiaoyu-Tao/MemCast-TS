  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. The analyst systematically checks data completeness, identifies patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), and selects a simple averaging method due to limited historical data. The approach emphasizes practical implementation including timestamp handling, rounding conventions, and seasonality capture.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
