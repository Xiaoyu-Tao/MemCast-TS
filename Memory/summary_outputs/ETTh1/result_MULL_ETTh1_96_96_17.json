{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-term data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes data completeness checks, identifies clear daily patterns, and selects a simple averaging method due to limited data and absence of strong trends. The approach is pragmatic, emphasizing robustness and straightforward implementation over complex modeling.",

    "Hourly averaging leverages daily seasonality for short-term forecasts",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with emphasis on data inspection and pattern recognition, but uses simple heuristics (hourly averaging) rather than advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
