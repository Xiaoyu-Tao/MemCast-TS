  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, methodical approach to forecasting 96 hours of transformer load data using limited historical data (96 hourly points). The analyst prioritizes handling data constraints (small dataset, potential missing values) and seasonality, systematically evaluating SARIMA, exponential smoothing, and Prophet before settling on a per-hour linear extrapolation method. The approach includes data validation, model comparison, and manual regression calculations, reflecting robust analytical rigor despite the dataset's limitations.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Per-Hour Linear Trend Extrapolation": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Increasing trend across days for specific hours",
    "Complete data in the provided sample (no missing values)",
    "Hourly pattern variations (e.g., consistent increases at hour 0, hour 1)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple models over complex seasonal methods like SARIMA",
    "Day-of-week effects are unaddressable due to insufficient historical week coverage",
    "Per-hour decomposition enables trend capture despite overall data scarcity",
    "Linear regression per hour balances simplicity with trend projection needs",
    "Data validation precedes modeling (e.g., checking completeness, hourly grouping)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical analysis: includes model selection trade-offs, manual regression computations for 24 hourly segments, and data pattern examination, though constrained by the small dataset.",
