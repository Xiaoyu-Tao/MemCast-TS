  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical records. It focuses on identifying and leveraging daily seasonality patterns while acknowledging data constraints. The method prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, using basic statistical techniques rather than complex models due to the short 4-day dataset. The analysis includes data inspection, pattern recognition, and careful handling of precision in outputs.",
