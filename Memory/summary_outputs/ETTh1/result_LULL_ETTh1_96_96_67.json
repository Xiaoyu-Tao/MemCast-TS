  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting 96 future hourly LULL values using only 96 historical points. The analyst identifies daily seasonality but notes data limitations (only 4 days) prevent complex modeling. After considering SARIMA/ARIMA and trend analysis, they opt for a simple hourly profile averaging method as the most robust solution given the constraints. The approach includes thorough data inspection, method evaluation, and detailed computation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Possible downward trend (not explicitly modeled)",
    "Hourly fluctuation patterns (e.g., peaks at 07:00, troughs at night)",
    "Data completeness in historical segment"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data (4 days) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA requires more seasonal cycles)",
    "Hourly averaging captures daily patterns effectively with minimal data",
    "Trend detection is unreliable with limited observations",
    "Rounding precision (3 decimals) must match original data format",
    "Future forecasts assume pattern stability without external factors"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern analysis, method comparison (SARIMA/ARIMA vs. heuristics), and multi-step computational validation, but simplifies to averaging due to data constraints.",
