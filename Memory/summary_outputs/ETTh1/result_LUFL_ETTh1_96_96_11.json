  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under data constraints, starting with advanced model considerations (e.g., Holt-Winters, SARIMA) but ultimately selecting simple averaging due to limited historical data (96 points). The analysis prioritizes daily seasonality and handles data completeness, though it acknowledges limitations in capturing weekly patterns or trends. Forecasts are generated by repeating averaged hourly patterns across the prediction horizon.",

    "Prioritization of daily patterns over weekly effects due to insufficient data (only 4 days)",
    "Explicit handling of data limitations (small dataset constraining model choice)",
