  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on daily seasonality and data limitations. The analyst prioritized simple methods due to the short 4-day history, ultimately selecting hourly averaging to handle clear daily patterns while acknowledging potential weekly effects and missing value considerations.",

    "Used hourly averaging to preserve daily patterns while compensating for limited historical data",
