  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points (96 hours). The analyst prioritizes data validation, identifies daily seasonality, and selects a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach is pragmatic, focusing on observable patterns while acknowledging limitations like short history and potential missing values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No significant long-term trend",
    "Presence of negative values",
    "Stable intra-day patterns despite daily average fluctuations"

  "key_insights": [
    "Data completeness verification before modeling (confirmed 96 consecutive hourly points)",
    "Explicit handling of short data length (4 days) limiting complex model application",
    "Hourly averaging as a baseline for seasonal patterns",
    "Daily average analysis to validate trend absence",
    "Precision alignment (rounding forecasts to 3 decimals to match input data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data diagnostics, multi-step statistical calculations, and method selection rationale, but avoids advanced models due to data limitations.",
