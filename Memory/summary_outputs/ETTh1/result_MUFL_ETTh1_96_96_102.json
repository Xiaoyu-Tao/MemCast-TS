  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). After evaluating multiple methods, the model selects a simple averaging technique due to the clear daily seasonality and short history. Key considerations include handling potential missing values, outlier impacts, and additive modeling for negative values. The approach prioritizes practicality given data constraints while acknowledging limitations like trend ignorance.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Negative value handling",

  "key_insights": [
    "Short data (4 days) limits weekly seasonality modeling and trend detection",
    "Hourly averaging is effective for capturing daily patterns with minimal history",
    "Negative values necessitate additive models over multiplicative alternatives",
    "Outliers impact forecasts but mean is preferred over median for simplicity",
    "Data rounding precision (3 decimals) mirrors input specifications"
