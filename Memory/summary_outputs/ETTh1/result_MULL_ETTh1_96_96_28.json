  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data with limited historical points. It focuses on identifying daily seasonality, evaluating model constraints from small data size, and selecting a simple averaging technique to capture recurring patterns. The approach prioritizes practicality by smoothing noise through aggregation while addressing potential data quality issues like missing values and outliers.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly pattern variations across days",
    "Potential outliers in observations",
    "Consistent time-based fluctuations"

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (4 days) restricts complex model usage like SARIMA",
    "Averaging per-hour values across days effectively captures daily seasonality",
    "Rounding forecasts to match input data precision maintains consistency",
    "Repeating the computed daily pattern simplifies multi-day forecasting"
