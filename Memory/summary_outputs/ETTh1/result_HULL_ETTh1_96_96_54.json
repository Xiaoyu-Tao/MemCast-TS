  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to a short time-series forecasting problem with clear daily seasonality. The analyst identifies the 24-hour pattern, acknowledges data limitations (only 4 days of history), and selects a simple averaging method as the most feasible solution given the constraints. The approach is systematic, with thorough data examination and step-by-step computation, though it explicitly acknowledges the simplicity of the chosen method compared to more sophisticated models.",
