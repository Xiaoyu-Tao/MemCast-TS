  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling short-term hourly data with limited historical context. The analyst identified daily seasonality but faced constraints from only 4 days of available data. A simple averaging method was ultimately selected over more complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to dataset length, using hourly averages from the 4 available days to project a repeating 24-hour pattern for the forecast period. The approach demonstrated practical adaptation to data limitations while acknowledging potential weekly patterns and outlier presence.",

    "Prioritized simplicity due to short data horizon (96hr history)",
    "Used same-hour averages across multiple days to capture daily patterns",
