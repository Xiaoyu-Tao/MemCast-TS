  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to short-term forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, carefully evaluating multiple methods before selecting a daily-averaging technique. The analysis acknowledges data limitations and focuses on capturing observable seasonality while explicitly avoiding overcomplication given the constrained history.",

    "Short data horizons necessitate simple models to avoid overfitting",

Includes detailed data pattern examination and step-by-step computational validation, but avoids advanced statistical techniques due to data constraints.",
