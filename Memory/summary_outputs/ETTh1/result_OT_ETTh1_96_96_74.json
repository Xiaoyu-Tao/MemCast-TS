  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting hourly oil temperature data. The analyst identifies key patterns, handles potential outliers through robust methods, and addresses data limitations by selecting a simple yet effective technique. The process emphasizes seasonality detection, data completeness verification, and practical trade-offs between model complexity and available data.",
