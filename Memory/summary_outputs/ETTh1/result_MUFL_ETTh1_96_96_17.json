  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and selecting a simple yet robust method. The analyst acknowledges data constraints (only 4 days of hourly data) and explicitly rejects complex models like ETS/ARIMA due to insufficient data length relative to the seasonal period. The solution prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity while addressing the challenge of a long forecast horizon (96 steps).",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Inconsistent daily amplitude (e.g., higher night values)",
    "Absence of missing values in training data",
    "Limited data diversity (only 4 days covering Wed-Sat)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern and should drive the forecasting approach",
    "Data length must be considered relative to seasonal period (24-hour seasonality requires >4 days for robust modeling)",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours provides stability with minimal data",
    "Weekly seasonality cannot be captured due to absent weekday representation in training data",
    "Forecasts must replicate identified patterns without overcomplicating the model"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Includes data inspection, method comparison, and explicit trade-off analysis, but ultimately selects a simple heuristic due to data limitations. Features detailed implementation steps and data-specific calculations.",
