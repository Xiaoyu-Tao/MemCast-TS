  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data with clear daily seasonality. It addresses data limitations (only 4 days of historical data) by selecting a simple yet effective averaging technique. The analysis carefully considers day-of-week effects, data completeness, and rounding precision while acknowledging the inability to model weekly patterns due to insufficient data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Use of same-hour averages across multiple days to handle daily seasonality",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week mismatches between historical and forecast periods",
    "Rounding forecasts to 3 decimals to match input data precision",
    "Rejection of complex models (e.g., Exponential Smoothing) due to limited historical records",
    "Repetition of daily pattern for multi-day forecasts when lacking day-specific data"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines heuristic analysis of data patterns with practical implementation trade-offs. Balances statistical considerations (seasonality, averaging) with data constraints, but avoids advanced modeling due to limited dataset.",
