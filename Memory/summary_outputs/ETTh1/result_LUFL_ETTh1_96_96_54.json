  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, evaluates multiple methods including Seasonal Naive and complex models like SARIMA, but ultimately selects simple averaging due to insufficient data for sophisticated techniques. The analysis carefully considers data characteristics like potential trends and day-of-week effects while prioritizing robustness over complexity.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

    "Prioritizing simplicity when data is limited (4 days insufficient for SARIMA/Holt-Winters)",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Starts with advanced method consideration (SARIMA/ETS) but simplifies to basic averaging after evaluating data constraints. Includes multi-step validation of patterns, trend analysis, and day-of-week reasoning before selecting a practical solution.",
