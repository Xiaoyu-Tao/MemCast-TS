  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough, step-by-step approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. It focuses on identifying patterns, handling data irregularities, and adapting methods due to computational constraints. The analysis is highly detailed but ultimately selects a practical heuristic method combining daily pattern averaging and level adjustment for forecasting.",
