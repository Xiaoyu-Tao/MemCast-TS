{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling a short time-series (96 hourly points) with clear daily seasonality. After evaluating multiple methods, the analysis selected a seasonal naive approach due to data length constraints, repeating the last observed daily pattern for the forecast period. The approach prioritized simplicity and recent patterns over complex modeling.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

    "Data length (4 days) severely limits model complexity options",
