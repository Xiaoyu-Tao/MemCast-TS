  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling short-duration data with clear daily seasonality. The analysis prioritizes simplicity and practicality given data constraints, emphasizing pattern recognition, seasonality identification, and a straightforward averaging method. The reasoning is thorough data inspection and method justification, though constrained by the limited 4-day dataset.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Temperature drops at night and rises during daytime",
    "Potential downward trend on the last observed day",
    "Complete data without missing values in the historical period"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Prioritization of daily seasonality over weekly patterns due to short data length (only 4 days)",
    "Use of hour-specific averaging across historical days as a simple yet effective forecasting method",
    "Explicit handling of data constraints (short series) by avoiding complex models like exponential smoothing",
    "Rigorous rounding of outputs to 3 decimal places to match input data format",
    "Recognition of trend limitations (e.g., last day's temperature anomaly) but deliberate choice not to model it due to insufficient data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data constraints: Includes detailed pattern analysis, method comparison, and computational precision, but avoids advanced statistical models due to limited data. Focuses on practical implementation of heuristic approaches.",
