  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach for short-term forecasting of hourly time-series data with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and practicality due to limited historical records (96 points), opting for a straightforward averaging method over more complex models after evaluating data characteristics like seasonality consistency and absence of missing values. The approach emphasizes pattern recognition, computational precision, and alignment with data constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
