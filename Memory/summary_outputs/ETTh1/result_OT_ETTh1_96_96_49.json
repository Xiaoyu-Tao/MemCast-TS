  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a hybrid approach combining statistical trend analysis with heuristic seasonal adjustments to handle short time-series data (4 days). It focuses on daily seasonality detection, linear trend projection of daily averages, and seasonal component averaging while acknowledging data limitations. The method demonstrates moderate complexity with systematic decomposition but avoids advanced models due to insufficient training length.",
