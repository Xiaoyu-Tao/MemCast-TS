{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a moderately complex heuristic approach focused on handling short time-series data with daily seasonality and outliers. The model prioritizes robustness over complexity by using median-based daily patterns to forecast, explicitly avoiding overfitting given the limited 4-day history. Key strengths include thorough data inspection and practical adaptation to data constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of outliers/extreme values",
    "Negative value fluctuations",
    "No missing values in provided data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Median preferred over mean for robustness against outliers in hourly aggregation",
    "Explicit rejection of complex models (e.g., SARIMA) due to short data history (4 days) preventing reliable decomposition",
    "Daily pattern replication as primary forecasting mechanism",
    "Data rounding to 3 decimals to match original precision",
    "Handling of negative values without transformation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data-driven heuristics. Features multi-step analysis including seasonality identification, outlier impact assessment, and method selection justification, but avoids advanced statistical modeling due to data limitations.",
