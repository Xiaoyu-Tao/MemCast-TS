  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data and anomalies. The analyst identifies a suspicious 24-hour constant value as a potential anomaly, excludes it from modeling, and adopts a simple median-based method due to insufficient data for complex models. The approach prioritizes robustness over sophistication, leveraging daily patterns while acknowledging limitations like missing weekend data.",

    "Exclusion of anomalous periods (constant-value days) improves pattern capture",
    "Median aggregation preferred over mean for robustness against outliers",
    "Repetition of daily patterns as fallback for multi-day forecasting with limited history",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong data-driven heuristics: Involves anomaly detection, pattern decomposition, and robust aggregation, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data constraints.",
