  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting under constraints, focusing on identifying patterns in limited data (96 hourly points). It initially considers advanced models like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but defaults to a simple averaging heuristic due to data limitations and the requirement for manual computation. The solution prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while acknowledging but not addressing potential trends or missing values.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher daytime values with peaks at midday",
    "Lower nighttime and early morning values",
    "Increasing magnitude in recent days (potential trend)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns can be extracted via same-hour averaging across historical days",
    "Limited data (only 4 days) restricts complex model application",
    "Seasonality period (24 hours) is critical for pattern recognition",
    "Trend detection is noted but deemed impractical to model with minimal data"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis (model consideration, seasonality checks) that simplifies to heuristic execution due to constraints. Features multi-step data observation and manual calculations but avoids statistical modeling.",
