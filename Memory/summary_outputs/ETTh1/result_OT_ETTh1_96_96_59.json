  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive approach to time-series forecasting with limited data sample (96 hourly points). The analyst identifies key patterns, evaluates multiple modeling options, and ultimately implements a hybrid method combining Holt-Winters exponential smoothing with manual trend analysis. The process highlights careful consideration of data limitations, seasonality characteristics, and trend behavior while balancing statistical rigor with practical implementation constraints.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Small data size necessitates model simplicity and rules out complex approaches like LSTM",
    "Multiplicative seasonality is justified by increasing seasonal variation with data level",
    "Trend estimation requires balancing historical patterns with recent behavior",
