  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with daily seasonality. It focuses on handling potential anomalies and ensuring complete output despite warnings about missing values. The analyst identifies daily patterns, checks for trends, computes robust statistical measures (medians) to mitigate outlier effects, and generates a complete 96-hour forecast by repeating a median-based daily profile.",
