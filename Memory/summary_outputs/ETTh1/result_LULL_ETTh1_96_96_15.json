  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data. It identifies daily seasonality, handles an anomalous constant-value day by exclusion, and employs simple averaging of valid days to create a typical daily pattern. The approach is pragmatic given data constraints, though it acknowledges limitations like the inability to capture weekly patterns due to insufficient historical data.",
