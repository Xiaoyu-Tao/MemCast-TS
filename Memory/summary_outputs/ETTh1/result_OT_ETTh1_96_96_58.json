  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a conservative approach prioritizing recent data due to a sudden temperature drop in the last observed day. While multiple methods like averaging, trend extrapolation, and pattern deviation analysis were considered, the final approach uses a seasonal naive method by repeating the last day's hourly pattern for the forecast horizon. The analysis demonstrates awareness of daily seasonality and non-stationarity but opts for simplicity given data constraints and recent anomalies.",
