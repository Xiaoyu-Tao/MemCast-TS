  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting a short time-series (96 hourly points) with clear daily seasonality. The analyst evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, weighted averaging) but ultimately selects a simple seasonal naive approach due to data limitations, emphasizing recency and simplicity while acknowledging trade-offs in accuracy.",

    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model usage despite identified seasonality",
    "Recency prioritization (last day's pattern favored over historical averages)",
