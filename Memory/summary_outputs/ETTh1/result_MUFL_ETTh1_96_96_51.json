  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It emphasizes handling potential missing values, identifying daily seasonality, and adapting methods to environmental constraints. The analyst initially considers advanced models like SARIMA but defaults to simple averaging due to data limitations and the requirement for manual computation, resulting in a straightforward forecast by repeating daily patterns.",
