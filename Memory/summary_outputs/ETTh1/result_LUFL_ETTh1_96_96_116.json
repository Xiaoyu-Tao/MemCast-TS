  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging method to handle daily seasonality in the time-series data. Given only four days of historical data, the approach averages each hour of the day across available days to create a typical daily profile, which is then repeated for the forecast horizon. This practical solution effectively addresses data constraints while ensuring completeness.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, with consistent intra-day fluctuations observed across all days",
    "Limited historical records (4 days) necessitate simple models over complex statistical approaches",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days smooths random fluctuations while preserving seasonal patterns",
    "Forecast repetition assumes stationarity of daily patterns without long-term trend considerations",
    "Precision matching (rounding to 3 decimals) maintains consistency with input data format"

  "complexity_analysis": "Primarily simple heuristics with basic arithmetic operations; avoids advanced modeling due to minimal data, focusing on practical implementation over statistical sophistication.",
