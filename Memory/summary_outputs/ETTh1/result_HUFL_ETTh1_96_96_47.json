{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a simple averaging approach leveraging daily seasonality (24-hour patterns) due to limited historical data (4 days). It prioritizes practicality over complex models like SARIMA/ETS, focusing on hourly averages from past days to generate a flat forecast repeated across all 4 prediction days. The analysis demonstrates cautious data validation (missing value checks) but acknowledges limitations in trend detection and pattern variability handling.",
