  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed, iterative approach to forecasting 96 hourly data points using limited historical data (4 days). It evaluates multiple methods, ultimately selecting an exponential smoothing technique that prioritizes recent patterns while incorporating historical averages. The analysis thoroughly considers data characteristics, seasonality, and practical constraints like missing values and short history.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Exponential Smoothing": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Variation in daily patterns (e.g., Dec 23 differs from prior days)",
    "No missing values in the input block",
    "Recent data spikes (e.g., Dec 23 01:00 and 11:00)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data size (4 days) restricts complex modeling and weekly pattern capture",
    "Recent observations (Dec 23) should be heavily weighted in forecasts",
    "Exponential smoothing (alpha=0.8) balances last-day values with 3-day averages per hour",
    "Identical daily patterns are projected across forecast days due to insufficient data for day-of-week adjustments"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: includes method comparisons, data pattern examination, numerical validation, and adaptive weighting strategies to address data limitations.",
