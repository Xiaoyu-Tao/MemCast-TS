  "overall_summary": "The reasoning focuses on handling a 96-hour forecast with limited historical points and a suspected anomaly. The analyst prioritizes simple averaging of non-anomalous days over complex models due to data scarcity, while carefully considering potential missing values and anomaly impacts. The approach emphasizes practical pattern extraction over statistical sophistication given constraints.",
