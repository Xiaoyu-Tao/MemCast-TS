  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a heuristic approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging to handle hourly data with identified anomalies. The analyst focuses on pattern recognition, outlier exclusion, and pragmatic solutions for missing context (e.g., weekend patterns), prioritizing simplicity given data constraints. The approach is systematic but limited by the absence of advanced statistical modeling.",

    "Daily seasonality (diurnal variation)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Exclusion of anomalous days (e.g., constant-value periods) to avoid skewing forecasts",
    "Hourly profile construction via averaging of corresponding hours across non-anomalous days",
    "Recognition of calendar effects (e.g., weekends) despite inability to model them due to data gaps",
    "Repetition of derived daily patterns for multi-day forecasts as a fallback strategy"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, anomaly handling, and pattern extraction, but relies on basic heuristics rather than statistical models. Includes multi-step reasoning about temporal features (e.g., holidays, weekends) but lacks computational sophistication.",
