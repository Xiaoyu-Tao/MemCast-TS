  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling hourly data with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and robustness, evaluating multiple methods before selecting a straightforward averaging technique due to data limitations and implementation constraints. Key considerations include seasonality patterns, missing value checks, and output formatting.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Periods of constant values",
    "Non-stationarity in data trends",
    "Value ranges from 0.213 to 11.798"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Identification of 24-hour seasonality as the dominant pattern",
    "Preference for simple methods over complex models (e.g., SARIMA) due to limited historical data (only 4 days)",
    "Hourly averaging across multiple days to capture typical daily patterns",
    "Rigorous rounding of forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Explicit handling of datetime formatting for output consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough evaluation of alternatives, though ultimately implemented through simple heuristics. Includes multi-step data inspection, method comparison, and manual calculations while maintaining practical constraints.",
