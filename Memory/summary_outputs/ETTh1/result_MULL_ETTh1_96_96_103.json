  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive approach to forecasting 96 future data points for hourly time-series data. It begins by identifying key characteristics like daily seasonality and potential missing values, evaluates advanced models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), but ultimately implements a simple averaging method due to computational constraints. The approach includes outlier consideration, day-of-week analysis, and pattern replication, balancing theoretical rigor with practical implementation.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Outlier presence (e.g., elevated values on 2017-08-20)",
    "Day-of-week patterns (weekday vs. weekend differentiation)",
    "Handling of potential missing values"

  "key_insights": [
    "Utilization of historical same-hour averages to capture daily seasonality",

    "Practical adaptation from complex models to heuristic methods under constraints",
    "Data completeness assurance for forecast outputs"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step analysis: combines theoretical model evaluation (SARIMA parameterization), data pattern recognition, outlier handling, and practical heuristic implementation, though constrained by the inability to execute computational models directly.",
