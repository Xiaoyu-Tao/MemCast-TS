  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. It initially considers advanced models like SARIMA but prioritizes simplicity due to the constraints of having only 96 hourly data points. The final approach leverages daily seasonality through hourly averaging, emphasizing robustness over complexity while addressing data limitations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Presence of both positive and negative values",
    "Complete data without missing values (in provided segment)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) makes complex models like SARIMA impractical despite seasonality detection",
    "Daily patterns are best captured by averaging corresponding hours across historical days",
    "Trends are intentionally ignored due to insufficient data for reliable modeling",
    "Rounding forecasts to match original data precision (3 decimals) is critical for consistency"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Balances advanced model consideration with practical simplifications. Includes multi-step validation of seasonality, data completeness checks, and detailed hourly computations, but ultimately defaults to heuristic averaging due to data constraints.",
