  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a thorough analytical approach focusing on identifying patterns, handling data constraints, and selecting appropriate forecasting methods. It emphasizes daily seasonality recognition, trend analysis through linear regression, and a custom additive decomposition method to generate forecasts. The approach is data-driven and carefully considers limitations of small datasets.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Downward trend in daily levels",
    "Changing hourly patterns across days",
    "Absence of missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is addressed through additive seasonal indices calculated from hourly deviations",
    "Limited data size (96 points) necessitates simpler models over complex ones like SARIMA",
    "Linear regression on daily means captures downward trend for level projection",
    "Additive decomposition combines projected daily levels with stable seasonal indices",
    "Multiplicative vs. additive seasonality evaluation based on consistent pattern scales"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step statistical analysis including seasonal decomposition, trend modeling, and custom forecasting logic",
