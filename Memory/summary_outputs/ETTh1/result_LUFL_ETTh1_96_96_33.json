  "overall_summary": "The reasoning focuses on handling a short time-series with daily seasonality and irregularities. The primary approach involves decomposing the series into hourly seasonal indices normalized by daily averages, then forecasting via these indices scaled by an overall historical average. The analysis balances methodological considerations (SARIMA, Prophet) with practical constraints (limited data, text-based environment), ultimately selecting a statistically grounded but manually feasible solution.",
