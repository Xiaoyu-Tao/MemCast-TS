  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It prioritizes handling daily seasonality and weekday/weekend patterns while acknowledging data constraints. The analyst considers advanced models like SARIMA and STL decomposition but opts for a simple averaging method due to insufficient historical data, focusing on practical implementation and format compliance.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "Weekday vs. weekend pattern differentiation",
    "Presence of negative values (especially on weekends)",
    "Complete data in provided window (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Using day-type grouping (weekday/weekend) for pattern separation improves forecast relevance",
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simplified methods over complex statistical models",
    "Forecast horizon length (96 points) exceeds practical model-fitting capabilities given history size",
    "Data rounding (3 decimals) maintains consistency with input format",
    "Explicit date handling ensures alignment between forecast periods and temporal patterns"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong heuristic focus: Combines data inspection, model consideration (SARIMA/STL), and practical simplification. Balances statistical awareness with executable solutions under constraints.",
