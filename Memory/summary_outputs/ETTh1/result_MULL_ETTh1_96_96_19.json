  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96-point hourly data with limited historical data (4 days). The analyst prioritizes handling potential missing values, identifies daily seasonality as the dominant pattern, evaluates multiple methods before selecting a simple average-by-hour technique due to data constraints. The process includes detailed data inspection, method comparison, and careful implementation with value rounding.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Consistent seasonal amplitude",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete data (no missing values in input)",
    "Hourly fluctuations with distinct daily patterns"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models like SARIMA",
    "Daily seasonality is the primary identifiable pattern requiring capture",
    "Average-by-hour method smooths day-to-day variations while preserving cyclical behavior",
    "Rounding forecasted outputs to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Explicit handling of datetime continuity in forecast period"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with thorough method evaluation and step-by-step computation. Balances statistical considerations (seasonality analysis, method comparisons) with practical implementation of a simple averaging approach due to data limitations.",
