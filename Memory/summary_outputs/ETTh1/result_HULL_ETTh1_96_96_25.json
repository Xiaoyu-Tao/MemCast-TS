  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load data with limited historical data (96 points). It focuses on daily seasonality detection and employs a simple averaging technique due to data constraints, while acknowledging potential complexities like missing values and weekly patterns that couldn't be modeled effectively with the available data.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",

    "Handling of potential missing values"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns are captured by averaging corresponding hours across available days",
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents modeling weekly seasonality or trends",
    "Identical daily patterns are projected forward when lacking trend information",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment for hourly forecasting"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed data handling: includes seasonality analysis, method comparison (seasonal naive, ETS, ARIMA), and implementation specifics, but ultimately selects a simple averaging solution due to data constraints.",
