  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a pragmatic approach to time-series forecasting under computational constraints. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and data completeness in the 96-hour input but notes insufficient data for weekly patterns. Given the limitations, they prioritize simplicity by selecting a heuristic averaging technique over complex models, ensuring feasible execution without libraries. The method focuses on generating a complete 96-point forecast by averaging hourly values across historical days and repeating the pattern.",

    "Prioritizing simplicity due to computational constraints and limited historical data (4 days)",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days to create a 'typical day' pattern",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern for the forecast horizon",
    "Rounding forecasted values to match input data precision (3 decimals)",
    "Explicit handling of date sequence generation for future timestamps"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with practical simplifications. The reasoning includes multi-step data inspection (pattern recognition, missing value checks) and method evaluation (seasonal naive, exponential smoothing), but defaults to heuristic averaging due to constraints. Involves detailed hourly calculations and date logic, yet avoids statistical modeling.",
