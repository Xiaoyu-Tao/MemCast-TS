  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on handling short historical data with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity by using hourly averaging to capture the 24-hour cycle, explicitly addressing potential missing values and day-of-week considerations while acknowledging data limitations. The analysis is thorough in data inspection and computation but avoids complex models due to limited history.",
