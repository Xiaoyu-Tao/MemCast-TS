  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of a short time-series dataset (96 hourly oil temperature readings) to forecast the next 96 hours. The approach emphasizes handling daily seasonality and a downward trend through heuristic decomposition, balancing statistical methods with practical adjustments for data limitations. The reasoning is thorough, methodical, and acknowledges uncertainties like potential negative forecasts.",

    "Heuristic Decomposition (Daily Mean + Hourly Deviation)": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Downward trend in daily means",
    "No missing values in the provided segment",
    "Non-stationary behavior with anomalies"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex models like SARIMA/ETS for 24-period seasonality",
    "Decomposition into daily means and hourly deviations effectively handles seasonality-trend interplay",
    "Linear regression on daily means captures the downward trend but risks unrealistic forecasts (e.g., negative values)",
    "Averaging hourly deviations across days stabilizes seasonal patterns despite daily variations"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: involves data inspection, method comparison, decomposition, statistical modeling (linear regression), and heuristic adjustments, all while addressing data constraints and domain uncertainties.",
