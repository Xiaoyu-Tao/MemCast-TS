  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited and anomalous data. The analyst identifies a significant anomaly (24-hour constant value), excludes it from modeling, and adopts a simple averaging method due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes interpretability over complex modeling, leveraging available non-anomalous days to construct a typical daily pattern that is repeated for the forecast horizon.",
