  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting using limited historical points. It prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by leveraging observed daily patterns while acknowledging data limitations. The model identifies clear daily seasonality but rejects complex methods due to insufficient data length, opting instead for a straightforward hourly averaging technique. The reasoning is systematic, data-driven, and transparent about its assumptions and compromises.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Dominant daily patterns can be captured through hourly averaging across available days",
    "Limited history (96 points) makes complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing impractical",
    "Forecast horizon matching historical length enables pattern repetition strategies",
    "Data granularity (hourly) drives seasonality-focused approaches",
    "Explicit handling of decimal precision to maintain data consistency"
