  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to forecasting 96-hour hourly data using limited historical data (4 days). The model evaluates multiple methods but prioritizes simplicity due to data constraints, ultimately selecting a daily profile averaging technique. Key considerations include seasonality detection, trend analysis, and handling potential missing values, with the reasoning showing moderate depth in method evaluation but practical simplification for implementation.",

    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (96 points) constrains complex model selection (ARIMA/ML)",
    "Daily profile averaging is preferred for short-term forecasts with clear seasonality",
    "Trend adjustment considered but omitted for simplicity in final implementation",
    "Overall average can be derived from hourly averages due to data structure"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines statistical model evaluation (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) with practical heuristics. Includes multi-step validation of patterns, adjustment calculations, and implementation trade-off analysis, but simplifies to basic averaging due to data limitations.",
