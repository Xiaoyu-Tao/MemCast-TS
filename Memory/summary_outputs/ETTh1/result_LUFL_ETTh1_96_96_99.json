  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, focusing on identifying daily seasonality and selecting a simple yet effective averaging method. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple techniques (SARIMA, ETS, seasonal decomposition) but ultimately chooses hourly averaging due to data constraints, ensuring computational efficiency while acknowledging its limitations for capturing emerging trends.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Complete data with no missing values",
    "Variation in peak magnitudes across days (e.g., higher evening peaks)",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (96 points) necessitates simple methods to avoid overfitting",
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality with minimal computation",
    "Recent observations may be more representative but are balanced via averaging",
    "Rounding precision (3 decimals) maintains consistency with input data",
    "Explicit pattern repetition for multi-day forecasts ensures consistency"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves method evaluation, data pattern analysis, and step-by-step computations, but prioritizes implementable solutions over statistical sophistication due to data limitations.",
