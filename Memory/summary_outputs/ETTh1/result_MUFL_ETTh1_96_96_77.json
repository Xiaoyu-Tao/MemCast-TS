  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting hourly time-series data with limited historical points (96 hours). The analyst prioritizes identifying seasonality patterns and handles data constraints by selecting a tailored averaging method. Key strengths include recognizing weekday-weekend variations and justifying method choices through data inspection, though the approach remains simple due to insufficient data for complex modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Higher nighttime/early morning values",
    "Lower daytime values (notably negative around noon)",
    "Weekday vs. weekend load variations"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary predictable pattern when weekly data is insufficient",
    "Weekday data (Friday/Monday) should be prioritized over weekends for weekday predictions",
    "Short data horizons (4 days) limit trend detection and complex modeling",
    "Hourly averaging of comparable days provides a viable baseline for near-term forecasts"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step heuristic analysis. Combines data pattern recognition, day-type classification, and iterative method evaluation, but relies on simple averaging due to data constraints rather than advanced statistical models.",
