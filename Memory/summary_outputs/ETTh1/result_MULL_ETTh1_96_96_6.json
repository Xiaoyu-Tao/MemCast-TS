  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a small dataset of 96 hourly points. The analyst identifies data characteristics, evaluates multiple methods, and develops a custom heuristic solution combining seasonal patterns with trend adjustments. The approach is pragmatic given data limitations, focusing on daily seasonality and linear trend projection while addressing practical concerns like decimal rounding and date handling.",
