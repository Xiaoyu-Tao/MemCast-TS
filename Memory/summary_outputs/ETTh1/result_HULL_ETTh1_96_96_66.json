  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging to handle daily seasonality. The analyst identified the 24-hour pattern in electricity transformer load data, acknowledged data limitations (only 4 days of history), and implemented a computationally lightweight solution. The approach prioritizes interpretability over complexity but lacks advanced modeling for potential trends or weekly patterns.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Absence of clear trend",
    "Complete data gaps (no missing values in training period)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Hourly averaging effectively captures daily seasonality patterns",
    "Limited historical data (96 points) constrains complex modeling",
    "Forecast horizon length (96 steps) equals training data length",
    "Date-time handling for consistent hourly forecasting",
    "Value rounding for output consistency (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately simple with clear step-by-step execution. Focuses on data grouping and arithmetic operations without advanced statistical modeling. Includes practical considerations like datetime formatting and value rounding, but omits trend analysis or model validation.",
