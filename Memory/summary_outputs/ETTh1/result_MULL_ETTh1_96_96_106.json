  "overall_summary": "The forecasting approach focused on handling an identified anomaly (constant values on 2017-08-31) and leveraging daily patterns from non-anomalous days. A robust median-based method was employed to create an hourly profile, repeated across the forecast horizon. The reasoning demonstrated systematic anomaly exclusion, pattern analysis, and adaptation to data limitations while maintaining simplicity.",
