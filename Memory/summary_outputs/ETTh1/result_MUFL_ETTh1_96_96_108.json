  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on forecasting 96 future hourly values using a 4-day historical dataset with daily seasonality. The analyst prioritized handling potential missing values and negative data points while balancing model complexity. The final approach used simple hourly averaging across days due to limited data size, absence of clear trends, and practical implementation constraints, though initial considerations included SARIMA and STL decomposition methods.",
