  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting that begins with advanced model considerations (SARIMA) but defaults to a simple averaging method due to implementation constraints. The analyst identifies key data characteristics like daily seasonality and outliers, but the solution prioritizes simplicity and feasibility over statistical sophistication, resulting in a heuristic-based forecast.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Presence of outliers (e.g., temperature drops)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No significant long-term trend in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the primary pattern requiring explicit modeling (e.g., via hourly averaging or SARIMA seasonality parameters)",
    "Outliers in historical data must be addressed (e.g., through averaging or median-based approaches to mitigate impact)",
    "Practical constraints often necessitate simplified methods despite awareness of advanced techniques",
    "Data presentation consistency (e.g., 3-decimal precision) is critical for output formatting"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex initial analysis with detailed SARIMA parameter considerations, but ultimately simplified to heuristic implementation due to constraints. Balances statistical awareness with pragmatic execution.",
