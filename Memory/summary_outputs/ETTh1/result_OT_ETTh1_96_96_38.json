  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a structured approach to forecasting hourly oil temperature data. The analyst identifies daily seasonality and the absence of a clear trend, then selects a simple averaging method due to constraints preventing code execution. The method involves computing hourly averages across historical days and repeating this pattern for the forecast horizon, providing a pragmatic baseline solution.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Complete data without missing values",
    "Hourly fluctuations within each day"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, requiring hourly grouping for forecasting",
    "Short data history (96 points) limits complex model application",
    "Averaging same-hour observations across days provides a stable baseline forecast",
    "Forecast horizon matches historical period length (96 hours), enabling pattern repetition",
    "Rounding outputs to 3 decimals maintains data consistency"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Includes consideration of SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models, detailed data pattern examination, and multi-step averaging logic, but simplifies implementation due to constraints.",
