  "overall_summary": "The forecasting approach combines daily seasonality analysis with linear trend projection. The method focuses on leveraging the most recent day's pattern adjusted by a calculated upward trend, using linear regression on daily averages. Reasoning demonstrates moderate complexity with careful consideration of limited data (4 days), explicit trend calculations, and pattern scaling while acknowledging potential limitations around weekly patterns and weekend effects.",
