  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96 future hourly data points using a simple averaging technique. It identifies clear daily seasonality in the 4-day historical dataset but notes limitations for complex models due to the short data length. After evaluating alternatives like SARIMA and STL decomposition, it adopts a naive seasonal forecast by averaging each hour across historical days and repeating the pattern for the forecast horizon, with careful rounding to match original data format.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Low nighttime values and higher daytime values",
    "No discernible long-term trend",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values in provided segment)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data length (4 days) restricts complex model application despite clear seasonality",
    "Hourly averaging is preferred over trend-based methods due to stable daily patterns",
    "Rounding computed averages to 3 decimals maintains consistency with input data precision",
    "Data grouping by hour enables efficient pattern extraction for seasonal forecasting",
    "Future data generation assumes pattern stability without trend adjustments"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines initial consideration of advanced models (SARIMA/STL) with practical simplification due to data constraints, featuring detailed hourly computations and rounding logic.",
