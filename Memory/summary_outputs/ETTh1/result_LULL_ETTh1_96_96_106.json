{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a heuristic approach focusing on daily seasonality and anomaly detection. After considering but dismissing more complex models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) due to limited data, the analysis identifies an anomalous day and uses a simple average of non-anomalous days to forecast. The method prioritizes robustness over complexity given the 96-hour dataset and handles potential missing values through completeness checks.",
