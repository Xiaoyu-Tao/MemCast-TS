  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach focused on handling short time-series data with clear daily seasonality. It prioritizes simplicity and feasibility under constraints, opting for a heuristic averaging technique over complex models due to limited data points (96 hours) and computational limitations. The solution emphasizes pattern recognition and pragmatic implementation.",

    "Prioritization of daily seasonality (24-hour cycles) as the dominant pattern",
    "Rejection of complex models (SARIMA/ETS) due to limited data and implementation constraints",

    "Data rounding to match original precision (3 decimal places)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong heuristic focus: Combines pattern recognition and statistical averaging while systematically evaluating and rejecting advanced models. Includes detailed data examination but simplifies implementation due to constraints.",
