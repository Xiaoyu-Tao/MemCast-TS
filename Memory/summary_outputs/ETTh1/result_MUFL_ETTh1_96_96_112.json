{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process focused on handling hourly data with potential missing values and daily seasonality patterns. Analysts prioritized simple averaging methods due to limited historical data (96 points), explicitly rejecting complex models like SARIMA and machine learning approaches. The final solution used hourly averages from 4 days of observations, repeated for the forecast period, while acknowledging limitations in detecting trends and weekly patterns.",
