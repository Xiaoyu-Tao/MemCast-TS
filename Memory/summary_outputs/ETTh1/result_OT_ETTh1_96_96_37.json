{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a detailed, multi-step approach to forecasting a short time-series (96 hourly points) with clear daily seasonality. It emphasizes adapting methods due to data limitations, exploring complex models like SARIMA and STL before settling on a custom heuristic method. The analysis is thorough, considering data patterns, model suitability, and practical adjustments for the forecast.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Changing levels (trend-like fluctuations)",
    "Complete data in the sample (no missing values)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Short data length (4 days) limits complex model applicability (e.g., SARIMA, STL)",
    "Daily profiles can be derived via hourly averaging across observed days",
    "Additive adjustments effectively align forecasted daily levels with historical patterns",
    "Simple averaging of recent daily levels provides a pragmatic forecast baseline"
