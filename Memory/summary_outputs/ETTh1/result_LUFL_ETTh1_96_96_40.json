  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to forecasting hourly transformer load (LUFL) by leveraging daily seasonality. With only 4 days of historical data, the analyst opts for a robust averaging method that captures the typical daily pattern, explicitly handling data constraints and output formatting requirements while acknowledging potential limitations like missing values.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)",
    "Hourly fluctuations (low nighttime, morning peaks, daytime variations)",
    "Handling of missing values (considered but not applied in this case)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Dominant daily seasonality drives the forecasting approach",
    "Limited historical data (4 days) favors simple methods over complex models like SARIMA/ETS",
    "Averaging same-hour values across days smooths day-to-day variations",
    "Explicit rounding of forecasts to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Date sequence generation aligned with the 96-hour forecast horizon"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data pattern recognition, method evaluation (SARIMA/ETS/naive), and practical implementation of averaging, with considerations for real-world constraints like missing values and output formatting.",
