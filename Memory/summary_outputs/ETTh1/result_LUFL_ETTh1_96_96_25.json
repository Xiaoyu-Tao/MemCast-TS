  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited data (96 hourly points). It focuses on identifying daily seasonality, handles data completeness explicitly, and selects a simple averaging method after evaluating alternatives like naive repetition and trend adjustment. The solution prioritizes interpretability and computational simplicity given the constraints.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) necessitates simple methods over complex models",
    "Daily patterns captured through hour-specific averaging across historical days",

    "Weekday-aware analysis (though discarded due to insufficient samples)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step validation: Includes data inspection, alternative method evaluation, daily/hourly statistical calculations, and rounding considerations, but avoids advanced statistical models due to data limitations.",
