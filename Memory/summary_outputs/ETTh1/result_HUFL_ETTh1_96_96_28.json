  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple statistical methods due to computational constraints. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, handles potential missing values (though none were present), and generates forecasts by averaging hourly patterns from historical data. The approach prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complex modeling.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Hourly pattern consistency",
    "Potential outliers (e.g., spike at hour 9)",

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns are captured through hourly averaging across multiple days",
    "Data completeness verification before forecasting",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed pattern analysis and manual computations, but relies on fundamental statistical techniques rather than advanced models. Balances data observations with practical implementation constraints.",
