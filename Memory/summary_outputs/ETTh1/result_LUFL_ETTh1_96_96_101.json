{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting using simple averaging to handle daily seasonality. It prioritizes robustness over complexity given the limited historical data (only 4 days), focusing on clear pattern identification, data integrity checks, and step-by-step computation. The method is thoroughly justified with data observations and manual calculations.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Absence of missing values in historical data"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns can be captured effectively through hourly averaging when historical cycles are limited",
    "Data inspection for trends and missing values is critical before selecting a forecasting approach",
    "Reshaping data into a matrix (days × hours) simplifies seasonal pattern extraction",
    "Forecast robustness relies on sufficient seasonal cycles (minimal here with only 4 days)"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately detailed with emphasis on data observation and manual computation, but methodologically simple. Focuses on heuristic-based pattern extraction rather than statistical modeling due to data constraints.",
