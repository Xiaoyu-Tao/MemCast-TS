  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach to forecasting 96-hour oil temperature data, starting with data inspection and method evaluation before settling on a simple averaging technique. The analysis acknowledges data limitations (only 4 days of history) and handles observed anomalies, ultimately implementing an hourly average method with precision considerations.",
  "method_distribution": {
    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomaly detection (unusually cold day on 2016-10-20)",
    "No missing values in provided data",
    "Temperature fluctuations (drops at night, rises during day)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) restricts complex model application (e.g., SARIMA)",
    "Anomaly handling through averaging mitigates impact of outlier days",
    "Hourly grouping preserves daily seasonal patterns",
    "Precision maintenance (6 decimal places) to match input data format",
    "Repetition of averaged daily pattern for multi-day forecasts"
