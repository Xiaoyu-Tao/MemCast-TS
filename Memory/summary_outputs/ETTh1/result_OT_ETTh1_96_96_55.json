  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a moderately complex analytical process focused on handling short time-series data with anomalies and potential seasonality. The analyst systematically evaluates multiple approaches (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) before settling on a robust median-based heuristic method to account for outliers while preserving daily patterns. The process emphasizes data quality checks, pattern recognition, and practical tradeoffs between model complexity and limited data availability.",
