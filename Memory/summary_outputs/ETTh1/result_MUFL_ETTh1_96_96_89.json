  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a thorough analysis of a 96-hour time-series dataset to forecast the next 96 hours. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for missing values, and evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, seasonal naive) before settling on a simple averaging approach. The process includes detailed data inspection, trend analysis, and consideration of adjustments, but ultimately prioritizes simplicity due to limited data and inconsistent trends.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Daytime variability with negative values and stable nighttime positive values",
    "No missing values in the provided data",
    "Inconsistent daily average trends"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, but insufficient data prevents weekly seasonality analysis",
    "Daily averages show no consistent trend, discouraging complex trend-based adjustments",
    "Simple averaging of corresponding hours across past days is favored for its robustness with limited data",
    "Multiplicative or linear trend adjustments were considered but rejected due to overfitting risks"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with detailed statistical checks (daily averages, linear regression) and method comparisons, but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data limitations.",
