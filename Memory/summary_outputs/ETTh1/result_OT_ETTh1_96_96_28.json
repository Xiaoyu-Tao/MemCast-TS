  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting using a simple averaging method due to computational constraints. The analyst identifies daily seasonality, checks for trends, and prioritizes generating a complete forecast output. The approach is pragmatic but limited by the inability to run statistical models, resulting in a basic projection that ignores potential level shifts.",

    "Seasonality handling through hourly averaging across multiple days",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong pattern recognition and methodological justification, but constrained to basic heuristics due to inability to implement statistical models. Involves multi-step data analysis and manual calculations.",
