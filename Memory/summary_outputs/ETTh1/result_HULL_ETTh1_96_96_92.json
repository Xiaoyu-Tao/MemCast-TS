  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a structured approach to time-series forecasting with limited data, starting with model consideration (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but shifting to heuristic methods due to simulation constraints. It emphasizes identifying patterns, handling potential missing values, and adapting to data limitations. The final method uses simple averaging technique based on recent data, balancing sophistication with practicality given the small dataset.",

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step heuristic analysis: Combines statistical concepts (seasonality, trend decomposition) with practical simplifications. Includes data inspection, pattern quantification, and iterative method adaptation, but avoids computational modeling due to constraints.",
