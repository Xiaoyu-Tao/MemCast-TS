  "overall_summary": "The reasoning process demonstrates a practical approach to short-term forecasting with limited data. After evaluating SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing methods, the analyst opted for a simple hourly averaging technique due to insufficient seasonal cycles (only 4 days of data). The solution emphasizes daily seasonality capture through heuristic pattern repetition while acknowledging data limitations and potential outlier impacts.",
