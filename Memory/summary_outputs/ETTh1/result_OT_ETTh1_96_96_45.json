{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning employs a heuristic-driven method focused on handling anomalies and leveraging daily seasonality. The analyst identified an anomalous constant temperature pattern in the last training day, excluded it from calculations, and used a simple averaging approach across the first three days' hourly values to create a daily pattern. This pattern was repeated for the 96-hour forecast period. The approach prioritizes practicality over complex statistical methods, with explicit handling of data anomalies and seasonality considerations.",
