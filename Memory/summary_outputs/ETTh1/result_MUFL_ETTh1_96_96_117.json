  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed analysis of a 4-day hourly time series with clear daily seasonality and anomalies. Due to limited historical records (96 points) and inability to capture weekly patterns, the analyst opts for a simple averaging method over complex models like SARIMA. The approach involves grouping data by hour, computing hourly averages across all available days, and repeating this pattern for the forecast horizon, while explicitly handling data anomalies without correction.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Anomalies/negative values",
    "Complete data (no missing values)",
    "Hourly pattern variations (night peaks, daytime drops)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) prevents weekly seasonality modeling despite day-of-week awareness",
    "Negative values treated as anomalies but used without correction due to task constraints",
    "Hourly averaging chosen for robustness against abrupt changes and data limitations",
    "Explicit handling of day-of-week mismatches between historical and forecast periods",
    "Forecast repetition acknowledges data insufficiency for trend extrapolation"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Involves multi-step consideration of advanced models (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing), detailed pattern analysis, and data grouping, but simplifies to heuristic averaging due to data constraints.",
