  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on identifying patterns, handling data constraints, and implementing a practical solution. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability by leveraging observed daily seasonality while acknowledging limitations like the absence of complex modeling tools. Data integrity checks for missing values and trend analysis form a critical foundation for the chosen method.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Absence of clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in historical data",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Reshaping data into a 4x24 matrix enables efficient hourly pattern analysis",
    "Averaging same-hour values across multiple days smooths noise while preserving seasonality",
    "Repeating the averaged daily pattern suffices for short-term forecasts without detectable trends",
    "Explicit validation of data completeness before model selection",
    "Hourly index mapping ensures accurate alignment of historical data for averaging"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with structured data decomposition and statistical validation. Balances theoretical awareness of advanced methods (e.g., ARIMA) with pragmatic implementation of heuristic approaches due to environmental constraints. Includes multi-step data transformation and pattern extraction.",
