  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting focused on handling limited data (96 hourly points). The analyst systematically evaluates methods like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing but ultimately selects a simple averaging technique due to data constraints. The approach prioritizes capturing daily seasonality while acknowledging limitations like potential weekly patterns and trend ignorance, resulting in a baseline solution.",
