  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a methodical approach focused on identifying daily seasonality in hourly data. Given limited historical data (only 4 days), the analyst prioritizes simplicity and practicality, opting for a straightforward averaging method over complex models. The process includes thorough data inspection, pattern recognition, and manual computation of hourly averages, with careful handling of timestamps and rounding conventions.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (diurnal pattern)",
    "Consistent hourly patterns with magnitude variations",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "No missing values in historical data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily patterns dominate forecasting due to limited 4-day dataset, making weekly seasonality unidentifiable",
    "Hourly averaging effectively smooths daily variations while preserving the core diurnal cycle",
    "Data completeness checks precede modeling to avoid unnecessary imputation",
    "Forecast replication relies on repeating the computed 24-hour average pattern across all future days",
    "Explicit rounding to 3 decimal places maintains consistency with input data format"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with strong emphasis on data exploration and practical constraints. Balances statistical awareness (seasonality detection) with pragmatic simplification due to limited data. Includes manual calculations and step-by-step validation but avoids advanced modeling techniques.",
