  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a detailed, adaptive approach to forecasting a short hourly time series with daily seasonality. It evaluates multiple methods (SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) but ultimately devises a custom decomposition technique due to data limitations. The solution addresses challenges like negative values and limited historical data (only 4 days) through iterative refinement, though the approach relies heavily on heuristic adjustments.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Negative values in the dataset",
    "Complete data (no missing values in the given 96 points)",
    "Short-term fluctuations requiring trend adjustment"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality must be addressed for hourly data, but limited cycles (only 4 days) constrain traditional seasonal models",
    "Negative values necessitate additive (not multiplicative) methods for decomposition and forecasting",
    "Trend projection via linear regression on daily averages provides a viable alternative when data is insufficient for complex models",
    "Base pattern replication from the last observed day, adjusted for projected daily level shifts, balances seasonality and trend"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Highly detailed with multi-step analysis: involves data decomposition, model evaluation, mathematical computations (regression, averaging), and iterative heuristic refinements to overcome data limitations.",
