  "overall_summary": "The reasoning focuses on forecasting 96 future hourly oil temperature values using limited historical data (96 points). It emphasizes handling data constraints, particularly the presence of an anomalous drop in the last day's data. The approach explores multiple methods but ultimately adopts a simple heuristic due to insufficient data for complex models. Key challenges include addressing potential missing values and reconciling inconsistent daily patterns.",

  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (only 4 days) restricts the use of complex models like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing",
    "The last day's anomaly requires special handling—either as a new regime or data error",
    "Simple pattern repetition is preferred when historical data is insufficient for robust decomposition",
    "Hourly averaging and median-based approaches were considered but discarded due to outlier sensitivity"

  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with multi-step evaluation of statistical methods, but reverts to simple heuristics due to data limitations. Includes decomposition attempts, anomaly assessment, and comparative method analysis before finalizing the approach.",
