  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to time-series forecasting focused on daily seasonality. The model identifies clear 24-hour patterns in the data and uses simple averaging of corresponding hours across historical days to generate forecasts. The approach is methodical, with thorough consideration of data completeness, pattern stability, and output formatting, though it relies on heuristic methods rather than advanced statistical models.",
