{
  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectory demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with clear daily seasonality. The analyst prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, opting for a heuristic method over complex models due to limited data (96 hourly points). Key strengths include thorough data pattern analysis, consideration of multiple methods, and detailed implementation planning. The approach focuses on leveraging observed daily cycles while addressing challenges like potential non-stationarity through averaging.",

  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Non-stationarity in daily patterns",
    "Hourly variability across days",
    "Complete historical data (no missing values)"

  "key_insights": [
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern, making hour-of-day averaging effective",
    "Recent data may be more representative, but averaging mitigates outlier impact",
    "Limited data (4 days) constrains complex model application",
    "Forecast horizon repetition leverages stable daily patterns",
    "Explicit handling of datetime alignment ensures consistent hourly mapping"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex: Combines data inspection, method comparison, and multi-step computations. Balances statistical awareness (seasonality, non-stationarity) with practical implementation using heuristics. Includes detailed data processing like hourly alignment and rounding conventions.",
