  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical, data-constrained approach focusing on simple heuristics due to limited historical data. It prioritizes identifiable daily seasonality over complex modeling, using hourly averaging as the primary method. The analysis shows careful consideration of data limitations and pattern stability while maintaining computational simplicity.",

    "Leveraging daily seasonality through hourly averaging when data is limited",
