  "overall_summary": "The reasoning demonstrates a practical approach to time-series forecasting with limited historical data (96 hourly points). It evaluates multiple methods but prioritizes simplicity and interpretability, ultimately selecting a heuristic averaging technique due to data constraints. The analysis effectively identifies daily seasonality and handles data formatting requirements while acknowledging limitations in trend detection.",

    "Simple Averaging": "100%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)",
    "No clear long-term trend",
    "Consistent hourly patterns across days",
    "No missing values in provided data"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited data (4 days) makes complex models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing less reliable",
    "Daily seasonality is the dominant pattern and should drive the forecasting approach",
    "Hourly averaging provides a reasonable baseline for short-term forecasts with repeating cycles",
    "Forecast values must be rounded to match input data precision (3 decimal places)",
    "Timestamp generation must account for calendar specifics (e.g., month boundaries)"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderate complexity: Includes method comparison and seasonality analysis, but simplifies to heuristic implementation due to data limitations. Focuses on practical computability without specialized tools.",
