        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The data spans from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours).\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any explicit missing entries (the timestamps are consecutive).\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with a time series with seasonality, we can use a model that captures seasonality. \n Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components (trend, seasonality, residual) \n   - Or use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters).\n\n However, note that the data has negative values and fluctuations. Also, we have only 4 days of data, which is very limited.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can use:\n   - A simple seasonal naive approach: using the last available season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours? \n     But that would repeat the same day 4 times. However, we see that the pattern is not exactly the same each day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Another idea: use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a model that can capture the daily pattern and a trend.\n\n We'll use:\n   - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with a seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   - Check for missing values and impute if necessary (in the given data, we don't have missing, but the problem says there might be).\n   - Fit a Holt-Winters model with additive or multiplicative seasonality? \n        Since the seasonality magnitude does not seem to change with the level, we can use additive.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any. \n So we assume the given 96 points are complete? But the problem says \"be aware of that\". So we should check.\n\n But the user only provided 96 points without missing? So we can proceed.\n\n Since we are not actually coding but generating the forecast, we have to simulate the output of such a model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n   - Calculate the average of each hour across the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n   - But we see that the pattern is not exactly the same. Also, there might be a slight trend? \n\n Let's look at the data:\n\n Day 1 (2017-06-18): \n   - Starts at 7.391, then goes to 7.462, 7.604, ... until 4.264 at 23:00.\n\n Day 2: similar pattern but values are a bit different.\n\n We can also consider a linear trend over the 4 days? But the data is hourly and we have 4 days.\n\n However, without the ability to run code, we have to rely on a method that we can compute manually? \n But the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the next 96 points.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n   - Use the last day (2017-06-21) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have to do that for 4 days? \n   - But the problem says to forecast 96 points (4 days). \n\n However, the problem does not specify the method. We are free to choose.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   Step 1: Check for missing values in the provided data? \n        The provided data has 96 rows and no missing? So we can use it.\n\n   Step 2: We use a model that can capture the daily pattern and the trend. Since we have only 4 days, we can compute:\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23) in the day, we have 4 values (from the 4 days). We can take the average for each hour.\n\n        Then, we can use that average pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n        But we see that the pattern is not exactly the same? Also, there might be a slight trend? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? \n\n        However, to be more accurate, we can use exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent days.\n\n   Step 3: We can also to adjust for a trend? \n\n        We can compute the overall trend over the 4 days? \n\n        The first point: 2017-06-18 00:00:00 -> 7.391\n        The last point: 2017-06-21 23:00:00 -> 7.214\n\n        The trend is slightly negative? But we have 4 days, so the trend per day is (7.214 - 7.391) / (4 days) = -0.04425 per day? \n\n        Then per hour: -0.04425 / 24 = -0.00184375 per hour.\n\n        But the data is volatile, so this trend might not be significant.\n\n   Step 4: We can use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h in day d (where d=5,6,7,8 for the next 4 days) = \n            average of the same hour in the past 4 days + (d-1)* (trend per day) \n\n        But the trend per day is very small and might be negligible.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the Holt-Winters additive method. \n\n   Without running actual code, we can approximate:\n\n        We'll calculate the level, trend, and seasonal indices.\n\n        However, given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide 96 numbers, we need a systematic way.\n\n   Given the time, we decide to use:\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we set:\n\n            forecast = average of that hour over the 4 days\n\n        Then, we adjust for the last known value? \n\n        But note: the last value is 7.214 at 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n        The average for hour 23:00: \n            Day1: 4.264\n            Day2: 5.010\n            Day3: 4.513\n            Day4: 7.214\n            Average = (4.264+5.010+4.513+7.214)/4 = 5.25025\n\n        Then for the next day (2017-06-22) at 00:00:00, the average of 00:00: \n            Day1: 7.391\n            Day2: 6.361\n            Day3: 7.249\n            Day4: 6.538\n            Average = (7.391+6.361+7.249+6.538)/4 = 6.88475\n\n        But note: the last value at 23:00 was 7.214 and then we jump to 6.88475? \n\n        This might be acceptable because the pattern shows that at 00:00 the value is usually higher than 23:00? \n\n        Let's check: \n            Day1: 23:00 -> 4.264, then next day 00:00 -> 6.361 (jump up)\n            Day2: 23:00 -> 5.010, then next day 00:00 -> 7.249 (jump up)\n            Day3: 23:00 -> 4.513, then next day 00:00 -> 6.538 (jump up)\n\n        So the jump is about 1.5 to 2.5. \n\n        Our forecast: from 7.214 (last point) to 6.88475 -> a drop? That doesn't match the pattern.\n\n        Therefore, we need to account for the fact that the next day's 00:00 is typically higher than the previous day's 23:00.\n\n        How to fix? \n\n        We can use the average of the differences between the next day's 00:00 and the previous day's 23:00? \n\n        But we have only 3 transitions:\n\n            Transition1: 4.264 -> 6.361: difference = +2.097\n            Transition2: 5.010 -> 7.249: difference = +2.239\n            Transition3: 4.513 -> 6.538: difference = +2.025\n\n        Average jump: (2.097+2.239+2.025)/3 = 2.1203\n\n        So we can set the first point (2017-06-22 00:00:00) = last point (2017-06-21 23:00:00) + 2.1203 = 7.214 + 2.1203 = 9.3343\n\n        Then for the rest of the hours on 2017-06-22, we use the average of the same hour from the 4 days? \n\n        But then we break the pattern? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average pattern for the entire day, but shift the entire day by the average jump? \n\n        However, note that the average pattern for day1, day2, day3, day4 are not aligned in level? \n\n        We can normalize each day by subtracting the daily average? Then we get the seasonal indices? \n\n        Then we can apply the seasonal indices to a base level? \n\n        Steps for seasonal decomposition:\n\n          Step 1: Compute the daily average for each day.\n\n          Step 2: For each hour, compute the average of the deviations (value - daily average) for that hour.\n\n          Step 3: Then the forecast for a future day is: \n                   base_level + seasonal_index[hour]\n\n          But what base level? We can use the average of the last day? Or the overall average? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n          Daily averages:\n            Day1 (2017-06-18): \n                average = (7.391+7.462+...+4.264)/24 -> we can compute.\n\n          But without computing 24 numbers, we can use:\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the overall average of the entire 96 points? \n\n          Overall average = (sum of all 96 points)/96.\n\n          Then for each hour, the seasonal index = average of that hour - overall average.\n\n          Then for the next 96 points, we set the forecast for each hour as: overall average + seasonal index for that hour.\n\n        But this ignores any trend and the level of the last day.\n\n        We can adjust: use the last value as the base? \n\n        However, the Holt-Winters method is more sophisticated.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide 96 numbers, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n But to make the transition from the last point, we adjust the entire forecasted day by a constant? \n\n        Let the average pattern for a day be: [avg0, avg1, ... avg23] for hours 0 to 23.\n\n        Then for the first forecasted day (2017-06-22), we set:\n\n            hour0: avg0 + (last_value - avg23)   [so that the transition from last_value to hour0 is avg0 - avg23?]\n\n        Actually, we want the transition from the last point (which is at hour23 of the last day) to hour0 of the next day to be consistent with the average jump? \n\n        We know the average jump from hour23 to next day hour0 is 2.1203. So we set:\n\n            hour0 = last_value + 2.1203 = 7.214 + 2.1203 = 9.3343\n\n        Then for the rest of the day, we use the average pattern but shifted by the difference between the first hour and the average first hour? \n\n        Specifically:\n\n            Let the average for the first hour (00:00) is 6.88475.\n\n            We have forecasted the first hour as 9.3343, which is 9.3343 - 6.88475 = 2.44955 above the average.\n\n            Then we add 2.44955 to every hour in the day? \n\n        Then the forecast for 2017-06-22 01:00:00 = avg1 + 2.44955, and so on.\n\n        Then for the next day (2017-06-23), we start with the last hour of the previous forecasted day (which is 23:00 of 2017-06-22) and then add the average jump (2.1203) to get 00:00 of 2017-06-23? \n\n        But then we have to adjust the entire day again? \n\n        This might be too complex and the error might accumulate.\n\n  Given the time, we decide to use the average pattern for each hour without adjustment for the entire 4 days, but we adjust the first point to account for the jump.\n\n  Then for the rest of the 4 days, we just use the average pattern? \n\n  Specifically:\n\n      For 2017-06-22 00:00:00: 9.3343 (as computed)\n      For 2017-06-22 01:00:00: average of the 01:00 values from the 4 days) \n          Day1: 7.462, Day2: 6.005, Day3: 7.640, Day4: 6.965 -> average = (7.462+6.005+7.640+6.965)/4 = 7.018\n      But wait, we have to adjust by the same shift? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the average pattern for the entire day and then shift the whole day by the difference between the first point and the average first point? \n\n      Let shift = 9.3343 - 6.88475 = 2.44955\n\n      Then for 2017-06-22 00:00:00: 9.3343\n      For 2017-06-22 01:00:00: 7.018 + 2.44955 = 9.46755\n\n      Then for 2017-06-22 02:00:00: average of 02:00: \n          Day1: 7.604, Day2: 6.787, Day3: 7.889, Day4: 6.574 -> average = (7.604+6.787+7.889+6.574)/4 = 7.2135\n          Then adjusted: 7.2135 + 2.44955 = 9.66305\n\n      And so on.\n\n      Then for the next day (2017-06-23), we start with the last value of 2017-06-22 (which is at 23:00) and then add the average jump (2.1203) to get the 00:00 of 2017-06-23? \n\n      But note: the last value of 2017-06-22 is the adjusted value for 23:00: \n          average of 23:00: Day1:4.264, Day2:5.010, Day3:4.513, Day4:7.214 -> average=5.25025, then adjusted: 5.25025+2.44955=7.6998\n      Then 2017-06-23 00:00:00 = 7.6998 + 2.1203 = 9.8201\n\n      Then for 2017-06-23 00:00:00, the average is 6.88475, so we would then compute a new shift for the day 2017-06-23: \n          shift2 = 9.8201 - 6.88475 = 2.93535\n\n      Then the entire day 2017-06-23 is shifted by 2.93535.\n\n      This means the shift is increasing? That might not be desired.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the same shift for all 4 days? \n\n      We only adjust the first day by the shift (2.44955) and then for the next days, we use the average pattern without additional shift? \n\n      But then the jump between days would be the average jump? \n\n      For the second day (2017-06-23) we start with:\n          00:00: last value of previous day (23:00 of 2017-06-22) + 2.1203 = 7.6998 + 2.1203 = 9.8201\n          Then for the rest of the day, we use the average pattern without shift? \n          So 01:00: 7.018 (without shift) -> but that would be a drop from 9.8201 to 7.018? \n\n      That doesn't match the pattern.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since we are only to provide the data, we decide to use the average pattern for each hour for the next 4 days, and we adjust the first point of the forecast to be the last point + average jump, and then the rest of the first day by the average pattern without shift? \n\n  But then the first day would have an inconsistent pattern? \n\n  We decide to use the average pattern for each hour for the next 4 days, and we do not adjust the first point. We simply use the average for 00:00 as the first point? \n\n  Then the forecast for 2017-06-22 00:00:00 = 6.88475.\n\n  Then the jump from 7.214 to 6.88475 is a drop of 0.32925, which is not consistent with the historical jumps (which were increases of about 2.1). \n\n  This might be the best we can do with a simple average.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days for the forecast? \n\n  We see that the last two days might be more representative? \n\n  We can use:\n\n        For each hour, average of the last two days (day3 and day4).\n\n        Then for 2017-06-22 00:00:00: (day3:7.249 + day4:6.538)/2 = 6.8935\n\n        Then the jump from 7.214 to 6.8935 is a drop of 0.3205, still not matching.\n\n  Given the above, I think the best is to use the average jump for the transition and then the average pattern for the rest.\n\n  We will do:\n\n        Let the next 4 days be: day5, day6, day7, day8.\n\n        For day5:\n            hour0: last_value (7.214) + 2.1203 = 9.3343\n            For hours 1 to 23: we use the average of the same hour from the 4 days.\n\n        For day6:\n            hour0: (last value of day5, which is the average of hour23 of the 4 days) + 2.1203\n            But we don't forecasted day5's hour23 yet.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            day5: \n                hour0: 9.3343\n                hour1: average of hour1 = (7.462+6.005+7.640+6.965)/4 = 7.018\n                ... until hour23: 5.25025\n\n            Then day6:\n                hour0: 5.25025 + 2.1203 = 7.37055\n                hour1: 7.018\n                ...\n\n        This way, the jump between day5 and day6 is consistent with the average jump, but the within-day pattern is the average.\n\n        But then the within-day pattern for day5 has a big drop from hour0 (9.3343) to hour1 (7.018) and then continues.\n\n        Let's see if that matches the historical pattern? \n\n        In the data, the hour0 is typically followed by hour1 which is around the same or slightly higher? \n\n        Day1: 7.391 -> 7.462 (up)\n        Day2: 6.361 -> 6.005 (down)\n        Day3: 7.249 -> 7.640 (up)\n        Day4: 6.538 -> 6.965 (up)\n\n        So it varies. The average hour1 is 7.018, which is below 9.3343, so a drop.\n\n        This might be acceptable.\n\n        We'll do the same for the next days.\n\n  However, note that the average pattern might be more representative than the jump-adjusted first point.\n\n  Given the instructions to provide the complete data and the complexity, we decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour for the next 4 days, and we ignore the jump at the transition. \n\n  This is the simplest.\n\n  We compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0 (00:00): [7.391, 6.361, 7.249, 6.538] -> (7.391+6.361+7.249+6.538)/4 = 6.88475\n      hour1 (01:00): [7.462, 6.005, 7.640, 6.965] -> (7.462+6.005+7.640+6.965)/4 = 7.018\n      hour2 (02:00): [7.604, 6.787, 7.889, 6.574] -> (7.604+6.787+7.889+6.574)/4 = 7.2135\n      hour3 (03:00): [6.538, 6.432, 8.244, 7.711] -> (6.538+6.432+8.244+7.711)/4 = 7.23125\n      hour4 (04:00): [7.178, 6.361, 7.960, 6.681] -> (7.178+6.361+7.960+6.681)/4 = 7.045\n      hour5 (05:00): [9.452, 7.604, 6.538, 8.102] -> (9.452+7.604+6.538+8.102)/4 = 7.924\n      hour6 (06:00): [5.721, 7.640, 5.224, 6.752] -> (5.721+7.640+5.224+6.752)/4 = 6.33425\n      hour7 (07:00): [2.665, 6.965, 3.518, 5.543] -> (2.665+6.965+3.518+5.543)/4 = 4.67275\n      hour8 (08:00): [-3.056, 3.838, -0.888, 4.406] -> (-3.056+3.838-0.888+4.406)/4 = 1.075\n      hour9 (09:00): [-11.194, 0.107, -3.625, 2.239] -> (-11.194+0.107-3.625+2.239)/4 = -3.11825\n      hour10 (10:00): [-4.513, -0.817, -2.914, 3.092] -> (-4.513-0.817-2.914+3.092)/4 = -1.288\n      hour11 (11:00): [-4.762, -3.909, -10.305, -1.315] -> (-4.762-3.909-10.305-1.315)/4 = -5.07275\n      hour12 (12:00): [-12.828, -2.025, -15.600, -7.818] -> (-12.828-2.025-15.600-7.818)/4 = -9.56775\n      hour13 (13:00): [-6.148, -8.031, -7.889, -11.620] -> (-6.148-8.031-7.889-11.620)/4 = -8.422\n      hour14 (14:00): [-2.097, -0.213, -13.077, -13.183] -> (-2.097-0.213-13.077-13.183)/4 = -7.1425\n      hour15 (15:00): [-5.863, 3.305, -2.630, -4.477] -> (-5.863+3.305-2.630-4.477)/4 = -2.41625\n      hour16 (16:00): [-2.523, 3.518, -1.777, -3.376] -> (-2.523+3.518-1.777-3.376)/4 = -1.0395\n      hour17 (17:00): [-1.173, 5.401, 0.071, -0.640] -> (-1.173+5.401+0.071-0.640)/4 = 0.91475\n      hour18 (18:00): [2.630, 3.980, 2.239, 1.706] -> (2.630+3.980+2.239+1.706)/4 = 2.63875\n      hour19 (19:00): [3.909, 3.873, 4.264, 4.229] -> (3.909+3.873+4.264+4.229)/4 = 4.06875\n      hour20 (20:00): [4.548, 4.442, 5.188, 4.904] -> (4.548+4.442+5.188+4.904)/4 = 4.7705\n      hour21 (21:00): [4.513, 3.909, 5.010, 4.833] -> (4.513+3.909+5.010+4.833)/4 = 4.56625\n      hour22 (22:00): [4.015, 4.122, 4.655, 4.122] -> (4.015+4.122+4.655+4.122)/4 = 4.2285\n      hour23 (23:00): [4.264, 5.010, 4.513, 7.214] -> (4.264+5.010+4.513+7.214)/4 = 5.25025\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day5 (2017-06-22): \n            00:00: 6.88475\n            01:00: 7.018\n            02:00: 7.2135\n            03:00: 7.23125\n            04:00: 7.045\n            05:00: 7.924\n            06:00: 6.33425\n            07:00: 4.67275\n            08:00: 1.075\n            09:00: -3.11825\n            10:00: -1.288\n            11:00: -5.07275\n            12:00: -9.56775\n            13:00: -8.422\n            14:00: -7.1425\n            15:00: -2.41625\n            16:00: -1.0395\n            17:00: 0.91475\n            18:00: 2.63875\n            19:00: 4.06875\n            20:00: 4.7705\n            21:00: 4.56625\n            22:00: 4.2285\n            23:00: 5.25025\n\n        Day6 (2017-06-23): same as above, repeated.\n        Day7 (2017-06-24): same as above, repeated.\n        Day8 (2017-06-25): same as above, repeated.\n\n  But this ignores any trend.
