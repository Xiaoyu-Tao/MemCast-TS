        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. So for the given data, we can proceed without imputation for the history.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that can handle seasonality. However, with only 4 days, it's challenging to capture weekly patterns, but we can try to capture daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 4. We'll use an appropriate time series model. Given the data is short, we can try:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last day (24 points) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would repeat the same day 4 times, which might not capture trends.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n    - ARIMA/SARIMA: but with only 96 points, and we need to forecast 96, which is a long horizon, and the model might not be stable.\n\n 5. Considering the above, we can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But again, with only 4 days, decomposition might be weak.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple model: the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But note: we have 4 days, so we can take the average of each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each day in the next 4 days? However, that would be a constant daily pattern repeated.\n\n    But let's look at the data: \n        The data from 2017-03-14 to 2017-03-17 (4 days) shows a similar pattern: \n          - The values during the night (around 18:00 to 22:00) are very low (negative and decreasing) and then they rise at night (23:00, 00:00) and then drop again in the early morning.\n\n    However, there is a trend? Let's check the last day (2017-03-17) vs the first day (2017-03-14): \n        The values on 2017-03-17 are generally lower? \n\n    We can compute the average for each hour over the 4 days and then adjust by a linear trend? But the trend over 4 days might not be significant.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we can use a simple method: \n    - We'll take the average of each hour of the day (across the 4 days) and then use that as the forecast for each day in the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note: the data might have a trend. We can try to remove a linear trend and then add it back? But with only 4 days, we can also ignore the trend and just use the average.\n\n 8. Steps for the simple method:\n    a) Group the data by hour (so we have 24 groups: hour 0, hour 1, ... hour 23).\n    b) For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n    c) Then, the forecast for the next 4 days will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 9. But note: the last day (2017-03-17) ends at 23:00:00. The next day starts at 2017-03-18 00:00:00.\n\n 10. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [ -0.107,  0.426, -0.391, -0.036] -> average = (-0.107+0.426-0.391-0.036)/4 = (-0.108)/4 = -0.027\n        hour1: [0.746, 0.426, -0.213, -0.284] -> (0.746+0.426-0.213-0.284)/4 = 0.675/4 = 0.16875\n        ... and so on.\n\n 11. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a downward trend? But we are only forecasting 4 days and the average might be acceptable.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-17) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But that might be too noisy.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we'll go with the hourly average.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we don't need to impute for the history.\n\n 15. For the forecast, we will generate 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 16. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 17. How to compute: we'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then take the mean.\n\n 18. Example for hour 0 (00:00:00\n        Day1: 2017-03-14 00:00:00 -> -0.107\n        Day2: 2017-03-15 00:00:00 -> 0.426\n        Day3: 2017-03-16 00:00:00 -> -0.391\n        Day4: 2017-03-17 00:00:00 -> -0.036\n        Average = (-0.107 + 0.426 -0.391 -0.036) / 4 = (-0.108) / 4 = -0.027\n\n 19. Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 20. Then, the forecast for:\n        2017-03-18 00:00:00: value = average of hour0 = -0.027\n        2017-03-18 01:00:00: value = average of hour1 = 0.16875\n        ... until 2017-03-18 23:00:00: average of hour23\n        and then repeat the same pattern for 2017-03-19, 2017-03-20, 2017-03-21.\n\n 21. We must generate 96 points.\n\n 22. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (-0.107, 0.426, -0.391, -0.036) -> (-0.108)/4 = -0.027\n        hour1: (0.746, 0.426, -0.213, -0.284) -> (0.675)/4 = 0.16875\n        hour2: (0.640, 0.533, 0.000, -0.782) -> (0.640+0.533+0.000-0.782)=0.391 -> 0.391/4=0.09775\n        hour3: (-0.249, 0.284, -0.675, -0.782) -> (-0.249+0.284-0.675-0.782)= -1.422 -> -1.422/4 = -0.3555\n        hour4: (0.000, 0.213, 0.178, -0.995) -> (0.000+0.213+0.178-0.995)= -0.604 -> -0.604/4 = -0.151\n        hour5: (-0.959, 0.675, -1.137, -0.462) -> (-0.959+0.675-1.137-0.462)= -1.883 -> -1.883/4 = -0.47075\n        hour6: (-1.883, -1.457, -1.244, -1.386) -> (-1.883-1.457-1.244-1.386)= -5.97 -> -5.97/4 = -1.4925\n        hour7: (-0.746, 0.142, -0.533, 0.284) -> (-0.746+0.142-0.533+0.284)= -0.853 -> -0.853/4 = -0.21325\n        hour8: (0.000, 0.355, -0.462, 0.000) -> (0.000+0.355-0.462+0.000)= -0.107 -> -0.107/4 = -0.02675\n        hour9: (-0.071, -0.569, -1.635, -0.782) -> (-0.071-0.569-1.635-0.782)= -3.057 -> -3.057/4 = -0.76425\n        hour10: (0.036, 1.777, -0.107, -0.569) -> (0.036+1.777-0.107-0.569)= 1.137 -> 1.137/4 = 0.28425\n        hour11: (0.569, 0.604, -0.959, -0.462) -> (0.569+0.604-0.959-0.462)= -0.248 -> -0.248/4 = -0.062\n        hour12: (0.178, -1.137, 0.178, -1.102) -> (0.178-1.137+0.178-1.102)= -1.883 -> -1.883/4 = -0.47075\n        hour13: (0.746, -0.284, -0.036, -0.036) -> (0.746-0.284-0.036-0.036)= 0.39 -> 0.39/4 = 0.0975\n        hour14: (1.350, -0.533, 0.746, -0.249) -> (1.350-0.533+0.746-0.249)= 1.314 -> 1.314/4 = 0.3285\n        hour15: (0.142, -0.959, 0.000, -0.320) -> (0.142-0.959+0.000-0.320)= -1.137 -> -1.137/4 = -0.28425\n        hour16: (-1.421, -1.564, -0.426, -1.315) -> (-1.421-1.564-0.426-1.315)= -4.726 -> -4.726/4 = -1.1815\n        hour17: (-1.670, -1.919, -1.528, -1.848) -> (-1.670-1.919-1.528-1.848)= -6.965 -> -6.965/4 = -1.74125\n        hour18: (-2.168, -2.416, -2.416, -2.168) -> (-2.168-2.416-2.416-2.168)= -9.168 -> -9.168/4 = -2.292\n        hour19: (-2.239, -2.239, -2.345, -2.025) -> (-2.239-2.239-2.345-2.025)= -8.848 -> -8.848/4 = -2.212\n        hour20: (-2.132, -2.345, -2.274, -2.452) -> (-2.132-2.345-2.274-2.452)= -9.203 -> -9.203/4 = -2.30075\n        hour21: (-2.487, -1.954, -2.594, -2.345) -> (-2.487-1.954-2.594-2.345)= -9.38 -> -9.38/4 = -2.345\n        hour22: (-0.817, -2.061, -1.741, -1.599) -> (-0.817-2.061-1.741-1.599)= -6.218 -> -6.218/4 = -1.5545\n        hour23: (-0.640, -0.924, -0.853, 0.462) -> (-0.640-0.924-0.853+0.462)= -1.955 -> -1.955/4 = -0.48875\n\n 23. Now, we create the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21) by repeating these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 24. We must generate the dates as well. The last date in the input is 2017-03-17 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-03-18 00:00:00.\n\n 25. We'll generate:\n        Day1: 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-18 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-03-19 00:00:00 to 2017-03-19 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-03-20 00:00:00 to 2017-03-20 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-03-21 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00\n\n 26. The values for each day will be the same: the 24 averages we computed.\n\n 27. We output the data in the same format: two columns (date and MULL) and 96 rows.\n\n 28. We must be cautious: the original data has 4 decimal places? We see up to 3. We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        date                 MULL\n        2017-03-18 00:00:00 -0.027\n        2017-03-18 01:00:00 0.169   [rounded 0.16875 to 0.169? but let's keep as computed and round to 3 decimals?]\n        ... \n\n 30. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. So we'll round the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. Let's recalc the averages rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: -0.027\n        hour1: 0.169 (0.16875 -> 0.169)\n        hour2: 0.098 (0.09775 -> 0.098)\n        hour3: -0.356\n        hour4: -0.151\n        hour5: -0.471\n        hour6: -1.493\n        hour7: -0.213\n        hour8: -0.027\n        hour9: -0.764\n        hour10: 0.284\n        hour11: -0.062\n        hour12: -0.471\n        hour13: 0.098\n        hour14: 0.329\n        hour15: -0.284\n        hour16: -1.182\n        hour17: -1.741\n        hour18: -2.292\n        hour19: -2.212\n        hour20: -2.301\n        hour21: -2.345\n        hour22: -1.555\n        hour23: -0.489\n\n 33. Now, we write the forecast for 4 days with these 24 values.\n\n 34. We must output in the required format.\n\n 35. We note: the dates must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 36. We generate the dates starting from 2017-03-18 00:00:00, then 2017-03-18 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n\n 37. We'll write the data in the answer block.\n\n 38. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the forecast, we are generating a complete set. So we are providing 96 points.\n\n 39. We are using a very basic method. In practice, more sophisticated methods (like SARIMA or ETS) might be used, but with only 4 days of data, it's hard to fit such models.\n\n 40. We proceed with the simple average method.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n",
