        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, in the provided 96 points, \n    there are no missing entries? We see 24*4=96 points (4 days). But let's check: \n        From 2017-01-17 to 2017-01-20: 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records. The data seems complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 4 days later, i.e., 2017-01-24 23:00:00).\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we have only 96 points, we can use a simple time series model. Given the data shows \n    and negative values and some fluctuations, we might consider:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or \n    - Exponential Smoothing.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has a daily pattern? Let's try to see:\n\n    Looking at the data:\n        Day 1 (2017-01-17): \n            Starts at 0.268, then 0.402, 0.000, ... \n        Day 2: \n            0.670, 0.000, -0.201, ...\n        Day 3: \n            0.670, 0.804, 0.268, ...\n        Day 4:\n            0.000, -0.201, -0.268, ...\n\n    It's not immediately clear if there is a strong daily seasonality. But we have only 4 days, so we can try to model with \n    a seasonal component of 24 hours.\n\n 5. Given the small data size, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But 4 days is very few.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with non-seasonal or seasonal (SARIMA) components.\n\n 7. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any. \n    So for the given data we can proceed. But for the next 96 points, we must output 96 numbers.\n\n 8. We can use the following approach:\n    - Use an ARIMA model with automatic parameter selection (using AIC or BIC) to fit the 96 points.\n    - Then forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 9. But note: the data might have a seasonal pattern. We can try a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 10. However, with only 4 days, fitting a seasonal model with 24 periods might be challenging (only 4 seasonal cycles).\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal ARIMA and hope that the autocorrelation structure captures the pattern.\n\n 12. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Check stationarity (differencing might be needed)\n     - Identify p, d, q (and if seasonal, P, D, Q, m=24)\n\n 13. But since we are to provide the answer without coding, we must rely on a method that we can describe.\n\n 14. Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n     - We'll use the last 96 points to compute the average for each hour of the day (over the 4 days) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n        However, the data does not look very consistent.\n\n 15. Let's try to see the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.268 + 0.670 + 0.670 + 0.000) / 4 = (0.268+0.670+0.670) = 1.608 / 4 = 0.402? \n        But wait, the fourth day at 00:00 is 0.000? Actually, the fourth day (2017-01-20) at 00:00 is 0.000? \n        Actually, the data for 2017-01-20 00:00:00 is 0.000? \n\n     We have:\n        Day1: 00:00 -> 0.268\n        Day2: 00:00 -> 0.670\n        Day3: 00:00 -> 0.670\n        Day4: 00:00 -> 0.000\n\n     So average for hour 00:00: (0.268+0.670+0.670+0.000)/4 = 1.608/4 = 0.402\n\n     Similarly, we can compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average over the 4 days.\n\n 16. But note: the data has negative values and the pattern might not be consistent. Also, the problem says the data has missing values? \n     But in the provided data we don't have missing, so we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n 17. However, this method would ignore any trend and only capture the daily seasonality. We don't have a clear trend in 4 days? \n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps for the forecast:\n      For the first day of forecast (2017-01-21) at 00:00:00: \n          We take the average of the previous four 00:00:00 values: (0.268, 0.670, 0.670, 0.000) -> 0.402\n      For 2017-01-21 01:00:00: \n          average of (0.402, 2017-01-18 01:00:00=0.000, 2017-01-19 01:00:00=0.804, 2017-01-20 01:00:00=-0.201) \n          = (0.402+0.000+0.804-0.201)/4 = 1.005/4 = 0.25125\n\n     And so on for each hour.\n\n 20. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not told which ones are missing. In the provided 96 points, \n     we don't have missing, so we can use all 4 points for each hour.\n\n 21. However, if in the future we had missing, we would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we might \n     have to handle missing values in the provided data? But the provided data is complete. So we proceed.\n\n 22. This method is simple and might capture the daily pattern.\n\n 23. But let's see: the data has a lot of zeros and negative values. The average might smooth out the pattern.\n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But 4 points is too few.\n\n 25. We'll use the average method.\n\n 26. We'll generate the next 96 points (4 days) by repeating the computed daily pattern? Actually, we are using the same pattern for each day? \n     But note: we are computing the average for each hour and then using that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 27. So the forecast for the next 4 days will be the same daily pattern? \n\n     For example:\n        Day5 (2017-01-21): \n            00:00:00 -> average of the 00:00:00 of the past 4 days\n            01:00:00 -> average of the 01:00:00 of the past 4 days\n            ... \n        Day6: same as Day5? Actually, no. We are using the same set of averages for each day? \n        But note: the pattern might change? However, we are using the same average for the same hour regardless of the day.\n\n 28. So the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 29. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n 30. We'll create a list of 24 values (each for an hour) by averaging the 4 days at that hour.\n\n 31. Then we repeat this list 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n 32. But note: the dates must be generated from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 33. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. \n     We are not detrending. This method is very basic.\n\n 34. Given the complexity and the data size, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 35. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and for each day we have.\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00:00): \n        Day1: 0.268\n        Day2: 0.670\n        Day3: 0.670\n        Day4: 0.000\n        Average = (0.268+0.670+0.670+0.000)/4 = 1.608/4 = 0.402\n\n     Hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.402\n        Day2: 0.000\n        Day3: 0.804\n        Day4: -0.201\n        Average = (0.402+0.000+0.804-0.201)/4 = 1.005/4 = 0.25125\n\n     Hour 2 (02:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.000\n        Day2: -0.201\n        Day3: 0.268\n        Day4: -0.268\n        Average = (0.000 -0.201 +0.268 -0.268)/4 = (-0.201)/4 = -0.05025\n\n     Hour 3 (03:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.206\n        Day2: 0.536\n        Day3: 0.402\n        Day4: -0.536\n        Average = (1.206+0.536+0.402-0.536)/4 = 1.608/4 = 0.402\n\n     Hour 4 (04:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.268\n        Day2: 0.603\n        Day3: 0.268\n        Day4: -0.402\n        Average = (0.268+0.603+0.268-0.402)/4 = 0.737/4 = 0.18425\n\n     Hour 5 (05:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.670\n        Day2: 0.268\n        Day3: 0.134\n        Day4: -0.737\n        Average = (0.670+0.268+0.134-0.737)/4 = 0.335/4 = 0.08375\n\n     Hour 6 (06:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.670\n        Day2: 0.268\n        Day3: 0.335\n        Day4: -1.608\n        Average = (0.670+0.268+0.335-1.608)/4 = (-0.335)/4 = -0.08375\n\n     Hour 7 (07:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.541\n        Day2: 0.402\n        Day3: 0.000\n        Day4: -1.541\n        Average = (1.541+0.402+0.000-1.541)/4 = 0.402/4 = 0.1005\n\n     Hour 8 (08:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.407\n        Day2: 0.335\n        Day3: 0.402\n        Day4: -0.067\n        Average = (1.407+0.335+0.402-0.067)/4 = 2.077/4 = 0.51925\n\n     Hour 9 (09:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.808\n        Day2: -0.469\n        Day3: 0.469\n        Day4: 0.201\n        Average = (1.808-0.469+0.469+0.201)/4 = 2.009/4 = 0.50225\n\n     Actually, let me recalc: 1.808 -0.469 = 1.339, then +0.469=1.808, then +0.201=2.009 -> 2.009/4=0.50225\n\n     Hour 10 (10:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.201\n        Day2: 0.067\n        Day3: 0.067\n        Day4: 0.737\n        Average = (0.201+0.067+0.067+0.737)/4 = 1.072/4 = 0.268\n\n     Hour 11 (11:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.335\n        Day2: 0.201\n        Day3: 0.000\n        Day4: 0.603\n        Average = (0.335+0.201+0.000+0.603)/4 = 1.139/4 = 0.28475\n\n     Hour 12 (12:00:00):\n        Day1: -0.938\n        Day2: -0.469\n        Day3: -0.871\n        Day4: 0.469\n        Average = (-0.938-0.469-0.871+0.469)/4 = (-1.809)/4 = -0.45225\n\n     Hour 13 (13:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.000\n        Day2: 0.000\n        Day3: 0.000\n        Day4: 1.206\n        Average = (0.000+0.000+0.000+1.206)/4 = 1.206/4 = 0.3015\n\n     Hour 14 (14:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.000\n        Day2: 0.000\n        Day3: 0.000\n        Day4: 1.005\n        Average = (0.000+0.000+0.000+1.005)/4 = 1.005/4 = 0.25125\n\n     Hour 15 (15:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.000\n        Day2: -0.268\n        Day3: 0.000\n        Day4: 0.335\n        Average = (0.000-0.268+0.000+0.335)/4 = 0.067/4 = 0.01675\n\n     Hour 16 (16:00:00):\n        Day1: -0.134\n        Day2: -0.871\n        Day3: 0.000\n        Day4: -0.670\n        Average = (-0.134-0.871+0.000-0.670)/4 = -1.675/4 = -0.41875\n\n     Hour 17 (17:00:00):\n        Day1: -0.268\n        Day2: -0.603\n        Day3: -0.536\n        Day4: -0.804\n        Average = (-0.268-0.603-0.536-0.804)/4 = -2.211/4 = -0.55275\n\n     Hour 18 (18:00:00):\n        Day1: -0.603\n        Day2: -0.536\n        Day3: -0.335\n        Day4: -0.737\n        Average = (-0.603-0.536-0.335-0.737)/4 = -2.211/4 = -0.55275\n\n     Hour 19 (19:00:00):\n        Day1: -0.201\n        Day2: -0.670\n        Day3: -0.134\n        Day4: 0.067\n        Average = (-0.201-0.670-0.134+0.067)/4 = (-0.938)/4 = -0.2345\n\n     Hour 20 (20:00:00):\n        Day1: -0.469\n        Day2: -0.536\n        Day3: -0.067\n        Day4: 0.067\n        Average = (-0.469-0.536-0.067+0.067)/4 = (-1.005)/4 = -0.25125\n\n     Hour 21 (21:00:00):\n        Day1: -1.005\n        Day2: -1.808\n        Day3: -0.469\n        Day4: -0.335\n        Average = (-1.005-1.808-0.469-0.335)/4 = (-3.617)/4 = -0.90425\n\n     Hour 22 (22:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.201\n        Day2: -0.402\n        Day3: 0.000\n        Day4: 0.938\n        Average = (0.201-0.402+0.000+0.938)/4 = 0.737/4 = 0.18425\n\n     Hour 23 (23:00:00):\n        Day1: 0.469\n        Day2: 0.603\n        Day3: -0.268\n        Day4: 0.268\n        Average = (0.469+0.603-0.268+0.268)/4 = 1.072/4 = 0.268\n\n 36. Now, we have 24 values for the 24 hours. We will repeat this pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 37. The next 96 hours (from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-21): \n            00:00:00 -> 0.402\n            01:00:00 -> 0.25125\n            02:00:00 -> -0.05025\n            03:00:00 -> 0.402\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.268\n\n        Day2 (2017-01-22): same 24 values\n        Day3 (2017-01-23): same 24 values\n        Day4 (2017-01-24): same 24 values\n\n 38. We must output the data in the same format: \n        date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n        HULL value with 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. But our averages have more. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. Rounding: \n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 40. Example: \n        0.402 -> 0.402\n        0.25125 -> 0.251\n        -0.05025 -> -0.050\n\n     But note: the original data had up to 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-21 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-21 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-22 00:00:00 ... until 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 42. We have the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimal places) as:\n\n        hour0: 0.402\n        hour1: 0.25125 -> 0.251\n        hour2: -0.05025 -> -0.050\n        hour3: 0.402\n        hour4: 0.18425 -> 0.184\n        hour5: 0.08375 -> 0.084\n        hour6: -0.08375 -> -0.084\n        hour7: 0.1005 -> 0.101\n        hour8: 0.51925 -> 0.519\n        hour9: 0.50225 -> 0.502\n        hour10: 0.268\n        hour11: 0.28475 -> 0.285\n        hour12: -0.45225 -> -0.452\n        hour13: 0.3015 -> 0.302\n        hour14: 0.25125 -> 0.251\n        hour15: 0.01675 -> 0.017\n        hour16: -0.41875 -> -0.419\n        hour17: -0.55275 -> -0.553\n        hour18: -0.55275 -> -0.553\n        hour19: -0.2345 -> -0.234\n        hour20: -0.25125 -> -0.251\n        hour21: -0.90425 -> -0.904\n        hour22: 0.18425 -> 0.184\n        hour23: 0.268\n\n 43. Now, we write the next 96 points by repeating the above 24 values 4 times.\n\n 44. We must output in the exact format.\n\n 45. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00  0.402\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00  0.251\n        2017-01-21 02:00:00 -0.050\n        2017-01-21 03:00:00  0.402\n        2017-01-21 04:00:00  0.184\n        2017-01-21 05:00:00  0.084\n        2017-01-21 06:00:00 -0.084\n        2017-01-21 07:00:00  0.101\n        2017-01-21 08:00:00  0.519\n        2017-01-21 09:00:00  0.502\n        2017-01-21 10:00:00  0.268\n        2017-01-21 11:00:00  0.285\n        2017-01-21 12:00:00 -0.452\n        2017-01-21 13:00:00  0.302\n        2017-01-21 14:00:00  0.251\n        2017-01-21 15:00:00  0.017\n        2017-01-21 16:00:00 -0.419\n        2017-01-21 17:00:00 -0.553\n        2017-01-21 18:00:00 -0.553\n        2017-01-21 19:00:00 -0.234\n        2017-01-21 20:00:00 -0.251\n        2017-01-21 21:00:00 -0.904\n        2017-01-21 22:00:00  0.184\n        2017-01-21 23:00:00  0.268\n\n        Then the next day (2017-01-22) starts again with 0.402 at 00:00:00, and so on.\n\n 46. We'll generate 4 days of this.\n\n 47. We must be cautious: the problem says the data has missing values? But we are not given any in the input. \n     And for the forecast, we are generating a complete set.\n\n 48. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 49. Note: The rounding might cause slight changes, but we are rounding to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 50. We write the answer in the <answer> tag as specified.\n\n Let's code the output (manually we have the 24 values, then repeat 4 times).\n\n But note: we must generate the dates correctly.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-21 00:00:00\n   Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n We have 96 rows.\n\n We'll write the 24 values for the first day, then the same for the next three days.\n\n However, we can write a loop for 4 days, and for each day, we output the 24 hours with the precomputed values.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   day0: 2017-01-21 -> use the 24 values in order (index0 to index23)\n   day1: 2017-01-22 -> same 24 values\n   day2: 2017-01-23 -> same\n   day3: 2017-01-24 -> same\n\n 51. We'll write the 24 values as a list:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            0.402, 0.251, -0.050, 0.402, 0.184, 0.084, \n            -0.084, 0.101, 0.519, 0.502, 0.268, 0.285, \n            -0.452, 0.302, 0.251, 0.017, -0.419, -0.553, \n            -0.553, -0.234, -0.251, -0.904, 0.184, 0.268\n        ]\n\n 52. Then for each day in the next 4 days (from 21 to 24 of January 2017), we output the date and the corresponding hour's value.\n\n 53. We must be careful: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 54. We'll generate:\n\n        base_date = \"2017-01-\"\n        for day_offset in [21,22,23,24]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-01-{day_offset:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = hourly_avg[hour]\n\n 55. But note: the day_offset: 21,22,23,24 -> we format as two digits.\n\n 56. We write the data.\n\n 57. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 58. We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00  0.402\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00  0.251\n        ... \n        2017-01-24 23:00:00  0.268\n        </answer>\n\n 59. We note that the original data had negative values and we are outputting negative values.\n\n 60. We are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We are providing 96 rows.\n\n Let's write the data.\n",
