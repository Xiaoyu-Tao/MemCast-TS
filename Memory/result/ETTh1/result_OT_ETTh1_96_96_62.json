        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We must handle the time series forecasting for 96 steps ahead.\n 3. Since the data shows a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some trend, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal ARIMA model, or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality.\n - Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but given the small data (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96 forecasts, a classical time series model might be more appropriate.\n\n However, note: the data provided is only 4 days (each day 24 hours -> 4*24=96). This is a very short history for training a model with daily seasonality (which requires multiple seasons). \n But we have to do with what we have.\n\n Steps in detail:\n 1. Preprocessing: Check for missing values? The problem says there might be missing values, but the provided data is complete. So we can proceed.\n 2. We'll use a model that can handle seasonality. Since we have hourly data and we see a daily pattern (period=24), we can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n Given the constraints, we choose:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with parameters (p,d,q) for non-seasonal part and (P,D,Q,s) for seasonal part with s=24.\n\n But note: with only 4 days, we cannot have too many parameters. We might choose a simple model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: temperatures rise during the day and fall at night.\n   - Also, there seems to be a slight upward trend from day to day? Let's check:\n\n   Day 1 (03-06): min ~4.9, max ~12.2\n   Day 2 (03-07): min ~7.2, max ~15.5\n   Day 3 (03-08): min ~8.4, max ~12.8\n   Day 4 (03-09): min ~9.0, max ~15.8\n\n   The trend is not very clear. We might consider a model without a strong trend component.\n\n 3. We can use a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last day? But that would be the same as the last day (03-09) for the next day (03-10). However, we have 4 days to forecast.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour? But that would be a fixed pattern.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a model that uses the last day and adjusts with a simple average trend? \n\n However, the problem requires a forecast for 96 steps (4 days). We must provide 96 values.\n\n Considering the above, we decide to use a simple model: \n   - We will decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n   - Then we can forecast the seasonal component by repeating the last seasonal period (or an average of the available periods) and add a trend component.\n\n But note: we only have 4 periods (days). We can compute the seasonal component by averaging each hour over the 4 days? Then we can use the last trend value and project it forward? \n\n Steps for decomposition:\n   - We can use moving average to extract the trend. Since the period is 24, we can use a window of 24 to get the trend.\n   - Then the seasonal component for each hour is the average of (observation - trend) for that hour in each day.\n\n However, with only 4 days, the trend might be the average of the day? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Let Y(t) = T(t) + S(t) + R(t)\n\n   We can compute the trend T(t) by a centered moving average of window 24. But at the ends we have problems.\n\n   We can also use STL decomposition? But we don't have enough data for multiple seasons.\n\n 6. Given the challenges, we might use a more robust method: Prophet by Facebook, which is designed for time series with seasonality and can handle missing data, but we are not allowed to use external libraries? We are to provide code? Actually, the problem does not require code, it requires the forecasted values.\n\n 7. Since we are the assistant and we are to provide the forecast, we can use a simple method:\n\n   - We note that the last day (03-09) has the highest values. We can use that day as the base and then adjust by the average change from day to day? \n\n   But the change from day to day2: the average temperature increased, then day3 decreased, then day4 increased again.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the four days for each hour to form the seasonal component, and then add a linear trend? \n\n   We can fit a linear trend to the entire series? \n\n   Let's assign time points: t=0 to t=95.\n\n   We can do:\n\n      Y(t) = a + b + c(t)\n\n      where b is the seasonal component for the hour of the day, and c(t) is a linear trend.\n\n   But we have 24 seasonal coefficients and 2 trend coefficients -> 26 parameters for 96 points -> overfitting? \n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      Step 1: remove the linear trend? \n      Step 2: compute the average for each hour.\n\n   How to remove the linear trend?\n      - We can fit a linear regression: Y(t) = beta0 + beta1 * t + error.\n      - Then subtract the trend to get detrended data: Y_detrended(t) = Y(t) - (beta0 + beta1 * t)\n      - Then for each hour index (0 to 23), average the detrended values at the same hour.\n\n   Then for forecasting:\n      - We project the linear trend for t=96 to 191 (next 96 points).\n      - Then add the seasonal component for the corresponding hour.\n\n   But note: the linear trend might not be appropriate because the data is short and the pattern is not linear? \n\n   Let's try to fit a linear trend to the entire 96 points:\n\n        t = np.arange(96)\n        y = [7.668, 12.311]  # the given OT\n\n        We do linear regression: y = a + b*t\n\n        Then we get a and b.\n\n        Then the detrended series: y_detrended = y - (a + b*t)\n\n        Then for each hour h in [0,23], we have 4 values (from the 4 days). We average them to get s_h.\n\n        Then for forecasting at time t (from 96 to 191), we do:\n\n           hour_index = t % 24\n           forecast(t) = a + b*t + s_{hour_index}\n\n   But note: the linear trend might not hold for 4 more days? \n\n 9. We can also consider using the last value of the trend and project with the same slope? \n\n 10. We'll do:\n\n        Step 1: Fit a linear trend to the entire data (t=0 to 95).\n        Step 2: Compute the seasonal indices for each of the 24 hours by averaging the detrended values for that hour.\n        Step 3: Forecast for t=96 to 191: \n                OT(t) = (a + b*t) + seasonal_index(t mod 24)\n\n 11. However, we must account for the fact that the trend might not be linear? But with only 4 days, it's the best we can do.\n\n 12. Let's do the calculation:\n\n        First, we have 96 points. We set t=0 for the first point (2017-03-06 00:00:00) and t=95 for the last (2017-03-09 23:00:00).\n\n        We compute:\n            sum_t = sum(t for t in 0..95) = 95*96/2 = 4560\n            sum_y = sum of all OT values\n            sum_t2 = sum(t^2) = (95*96*191)/6 = 95*96*191/6 = 95*16*191 = 95*3056 = 290320\n            sum_ty = sum(t * y_t)\n\n        Then:\n            b = (n * sum_ty - sum_t * sum_y) / (n * sum_t2 - (sum_t)^2)\n            a = (sum_y - b * sum_t) / n\n\n        Then we get a and b.\n\n        Then we compute the detrended series: for each t, d_t = y_t - (a + b*t)\n\n        Then for each hour h (0 to 23), we have:\n\n            h0: t=0, 24, 48, 72 -> d_0, d_24}, d_48, d_72\n            h1: t=1, 25, 49, 73\n            ... \n\n        We average the d_t for each hour h to get s_h.\n\n        Then for forecasting at t=96 (which is the next day, same hour as t=0, but we are at t=96 mod 24=0) we use s_0.\n\n        So for t=96: forecast = a + b*96 + s_0\n        for t=97: forecast = a + b*97 + s_1\n        ... until t=191: forecast = a + b*191 + s_23 (because 191 mod 24 = 23)\n\n 13. But note: the data might have noise and the linear model might not be perfect. Also, the seasonal pattern might change? \n\n 14. We must be cautious: the problem says there might be missing values, but the provided data is complete. So we can proceed.\n\n 15. Implementation:\n\n        We are to provide the forecast for 96 points. We'll compute:\n\n            n = 96\n            t = np.arange(n)\n            y = [7.668, 5.768, ... , 12.311]   # 96 values\n\n        Then:\n\n            sum_t = n*(n-1)/2   # because t from 0 to 95 -> 0+1+...+95 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n            sum_y = sum(y)\n            sum_t2 = (n-1)*n*(2*n-1)/6   # but note: t from 0 to 95 -> 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = 95*96*191/6 = 290320\n            sum_ty = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                sum_ty += t[i] * y[i]\n\n            b = (n * sum_ty - sum_t * sum_y) / (n * sum_t2 - sum_t**2)\n            a = (sum_y - b * sum_t) / n\n\n        Then we get a and b.\n\n        Then we compute the detrended series:\n\n            d = [ y_i - (a + b*i) for i in range(n) ]\n\n        Then we group by hour:\n\n            # We have 24 hours and 4 days\n            s = [0]*24\n            for h in range(24):\n                indices = [h, h+24, h+48, h+72]\n                s[h] = mean( [d[i] for i in indices] )\n\n        Then for forecasting:\n\n            for t_future in range(96, 192):   # 96 to 191 (inclusive) -> 96 points\n                hour_index = (t_future) % 24\n                forecast = a + b * t_future + s[hour_index]\n\n        But note: our time index in the model was 0-indexed for the first point. The next 96 points are from index 96 to 191.\n\n 16. However, we must note: the linear trend might be too simplistic. Also, the data might have autocorrelation that we are not capturing.\n\n 17. Given the constraints, we proceed.\n\n 18. Let's compute the linear regression parameters:\n\n        n = 96\n        sum_t = 0+1+...+95 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n        sum_t2 = 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = 95*96*191/6 = 290320\n        sum_y = we need to compute from the data.\n\n        We are given the data, so we can compute:\n\n            y = [7.668, 5.768, 4.924, 5.417, 6.402, 12.311]   # 96 values\n\n        We'll compute:\n\n            sum_y = 7.668 + 5.768 + ... + 12.311\n\n        We'll do it in code? But we are not writing code, we are to provide the forecast. So we must do the calculation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a calculator? But the problem has 96 points. We can write a small program? But we are the assistant and we are to reason.\n\n        Since we are to provide the answer, we can do:\n\n            We'll write a script to compute the linear regression and then the seasonal indices, then the forecast.\n\n        But the problem says: we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n        We are allowed to use any method? We can use a simple method if we don't have the exact numbers? \n\n        However, we are to be precise.\n\n 19. We decide to use the method and compute the forecasted values.\n\n        We'll compute the linear regression coefficients and the seasonal indices.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the method, only the forecasted values.\n\n        We can do the computation and then list the 96 forecasted values.\n\n 20. However, the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n        The next 96 dates: starting from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00? \n\n        The last date in the input is 2017-03-09 23:00:00. Then the next 96 hours:\n\n            2017-03-10 00:00:00\n            2017-03-10 01:00:00\n            ...\n            2017-03-13 23:00:00\n\n 21. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 22. Steps for computation:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the linear regression coefficients a and b.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the detrended series.\n\n        Step 3: Compute the 24 seasonal indices.\n\n        Step 4: Forecast for t=96 to 191.\n\n 23. We do the computation:\n\n        We are given the 96 OT values. We list them as an array = [7.668, 5.768, 4.924, 5.417, 6.402, 7.386, 7.105, 8.582, 6.894, 6.472, 8.090, 8.371, 8.653, 9.004, 10.271, 10.200, 11.678, 12.240, 11.396, 11.185, 10.904, 10.200, 10.341, 9.497, 10.200, 9.919, 9.849, 9.286, 9.778, 9.215, 8.723, 8.653, 10.271, 8.582, 11.326, 12.451, 12.381, 13.507, 15.476, 13.296, 12.522, 13.085, 13.225, 11.889, 11.818, 9.215, 7.246, 8.442, 8.442, 10.200, 9.426, 10.271, 9.778, 8.864, 9.638, 9.708, 10.130, 9.778, 12.733, 12.240, 10.482, 10.552, 12.240, 11.467, 10.904, 12.240, 12.803, 12.029, 12.029, 11.959, 11.818, 10.833, 9.567, 9.075, 11.396, 9.919, 10.271, 9.638, 10.200, 10.482, 11.889, 12.240, 14.351, 13.788, 13.929, 14.491, 14.280, 14.140, 15.758, 15.054, 14.914, 14.843, 13.647, 14.280, 14.140, 12.311]\n\n        We compute:\n\n            n = 96\n            sum_t = 4560\n            sum_y = sum(array)   # let's calculate:\n\n            We can do:\n\n                total = 0\n                for value in array:\n                    total += value\n\n            We get: total = 7.668+5.768+4.924+5.417+6.402+7.386+7.105+8.582+6.894+6.472+8.090+8.371+8.653+9.004+10.271+10.200+11.678+12.240+11.396+11.185+10.904+10.200+10.341+9.497+10.200+9.919+9.849+9.286+9.778+9.215+8.723+8.653+10.271+8.582+11.326+12.451+12.381+13.507+15.476+13.296+12.522+13.085+13.225+11.889+11.818+9.215+7.246+8.442+8.442+10.200+9.426+10.271+9.778+8.864+9.638+9.708+10.130+9.778+12.733+12.240+10.482+10.552+12.240+11.467+10.904+12.240+12.803+12.029+12.029+11.959+11.818+10.833+9.567+9.075+11.396+9.919+10.271+9.638+10.200+10.482+11.889+12.240+14.351+13.788+13.929+14.491+14.280+14.140+15.758+15.054+14.914+14.843+13.647+14.280+14.140+12.311\n\n            We calculate this sum: \n\n                We can break it into parts:\n\n                Day1: 7.668+5.768+4.924+5.417+6.402+7.386+7.105+8.582+6.894+6.472+8.090+8.371+8.653+9.004+10.271+10.200+11.678+12.240+11.396+11.185+10.904+10.200+10.341+9.497 = 218.306\n                Day2: 10.200+9.919+9.849+9.286+9.778+9.215+8.723+8.653+10.271+8.582+11.326+12.451+12.381+13.507+15.476+13.296+12.522+13.085+13.225+11.889+11.818+9.215+7.246+8.442 = 251.176\n                Day3: 8.442+10.200+9.426+10.271+9.778+8.864+9.638+9.708+10.130+9.778+12.733+12.240+10.482+10.552+12.240+11.467+10.904+12.240+12.803+12.029+12.029+11.959+11.818+10.833 = 252.414\n                Day4: 9.567+9.075+11.396+9.919+10.271+9.638+10.200+10.482+11.889+12.240+14.351+13.788+13.929+14.491+14.280+14.140+15.758+15.054+14.914+14.843+13.647+14.280+14.140+12.311 = 300.103\n\n                Total = 218.306 + 251.176 + 252.414 + 300.103 = 1022.0 (approximately, we did by hand so let me add more precisely)\n\n                Actually, we can use a calculator:\n\n                218.306 + 251.176 = 469.482\n                469.482 + 252.414 = 721.896\n                721.896 + 300.103 = 1021.999 -> 1022.0\n\n            So sum_y = 1022.0\n\n        Now, sum_ty:\n\n            We have to compute: for t from 0 to 95: t * y_t\n\n            We can do:\n\n                t=0: 0 * 7.668 = 0\n                t=1: 1 * 5.768 = 5.768\n                t=2: 2 * 4.924 = 9.848\n                ... until t=95: 95 * 12.311 = 1169.545\n\n            This is tedious.

But that won't work.\n\n            We decide to compute by days:\n\n                Day1 (t0 to t23): \n                    t0:0, t1:1, ... t23:23\n                Day2: t24 to t47: t=24 to 47\n

model: \n            base_trend = 7.5127 + 0.06596 * t\n\n        Now, we compute the detrended series:\n\n            For each t in [0,95]:\n                d[t] = y[t] - (7.5127 + 0.06596*t)\n\n        Then we compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the detrended values at the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Then for forecasting at time T (from 96 to 191):\n\n            Let t = T (which is from 96 to 191)\n            hour_index = T % 24\n            forecast[T] = 7.5127 + 0.06596*T + s[hour_index]\n\n        We need to compute s[0] to s[23]:\n\n            We'll create an array for s of length 24, initialized to 0.\n\n            For hour h in 0..23:\n\n                s[h] = ( d[h] + d[h+24] + d[h+48] + d[h+72] ) / 4\n\n        We compute d for the entire series:\n\n            Example for t=0:\n                d[0] = 7.668 - (7.5127 + 0) = 0.1553\n            t=1: 5.768 - (7.5127+0.06596) = 5.768 - 7.57866 = -1.81066\n            ... \n\n        This is very time-consuming by hand. We are to provide the forecast, so we must do it.\n\n        We decide to write a small script in our mind and compute the seasonal indices.\n\n        We'll do for a few hours and then extrapolate? But we must do all.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the provided data and the linear model to compute the seasonal indices.\n\n        We'll compute the seasonal indices for each hour:\n\n            h0: t0, t24, t48, t72\n            h1: t1, t25, t49, t73\n            ...\n\n        We already have the linear model: base = 7.5127 + 0.06596*t\n\n        We compute:\n\n            h0: \n                t0: d0 = 7.668 - (7.5127) = 0.1553\n                t24: d24 = 10.200 - (7.5127 + 0.06596*24) = 10.200 - (7.5127+1.58304) = 10.200 - 9.09574 = 1.10426\n                t48: d48 = 8.442 - (7.5127+0.06596*48) = 8.442 - (7.5127+3.16608) = 8.442 - 10.67878 = -2.23678\n                t72: d72 = 9.567 - (7.5127+0.06596*72) = 9.567 - (7.5127+4.74912) = 9.567 - 12.26182 = -2.69482\n\n                s0 = (0.1553 + 1.10426 -2.23678 -2.69482)/4 = (-3.67204)/4 = -0.91801\n\n            h1:\n                t1: 5.768 - (7.5127+0.06596*1) = 5.768 - 7.57866 = -1.81066\n                t25: 9.919 - (7.5127+0.06596*25) = 9.919 - (7.5127+1.649) = 9.919 - 9.1617 = 0.7573\n                t49: 10.200 - (7.5127+0.06596*49) = 10.200 - (7.5127+3.23204) = 10.200 - 10.74474 = -0.54474\n                t73: 9.075 - (7.5127+0.06596*73) = 9.075 - (7.5127+4.81508) = 9.075 - 12.32778 = -3.25278\n\n                s1 = (-1.81066+0.7573-0.54474-3.25278)/4 = (-4.85088)/4 = -1.21272\n\n        We continue for all 24 hours.\n\n        This is very long, but we must do it.\n\n        We do it for all 24 and then compute the forecast.\n\n        Given the time constraints, we might use an approximation or use a different method? \n\n        But we've come this far.\n\n        We decide to do it for all 24 hours and then the forecast for 96 to 191.\n\n        We'll create a table for s[0] to s[23]:\n\n        We'll do it systematically:\n\n            s = [0]*24\n\n            for h in range(24):\n                indices = [h, h+24, h+48, h+72]\n                d_sum = 0\n                for i in indices:\n                    base = 7.5127 + 0.06596 * i\n                    d_sum += (y[i] - base)\n                s[h] = d_sum / 4\n\n        Then for forecasting:\n\n            for T in range(96, 192):\n                hour_index = T % 24\n                base = 7.5127 + 0.06596 * T\n                forecast = base + s[hour_index]\n\n        We then output the forecast for T=96 to 191.\n\n        The dates: starting from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 (which is T=96, hour_index=0) to 2017-03-13 23:00:00 (T=191, hour_index=23)\n\n        We must generate 96 values.\n\n        Given the complexity, we might do the computation for the first few and last few and then provide the full list.\n\n        But the problem requires the complete data.\n\n        We decide to do the computation and then list all 96 values.\n\n        However, it's very time-consuming by hand.
