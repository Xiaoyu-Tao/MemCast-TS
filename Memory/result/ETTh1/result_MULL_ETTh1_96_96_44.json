        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the input? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\".\n    Since the provided 96 points are complete, we assume that the missing values are already handled or we are to forecast without having to impute the history? \n    But note: the instruction says \"these data will have missing values\", meaning the provided data might have missing values? However, the sample provided does not have any.\n\n    Let me check: The provided data has 96 rows, from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00 (24*4=96). So it's complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days, we can observe seasonality. The data seems to have daily patterns (24-hour cycle).\n\n 4. We are to use a time series forecasting method. Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 96 points (4 days), \n    we can use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the small data, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the previous day) as the forecast for the same time of the next day. But note: the pattern might change over the days? \n      However, the data shows that the pattern is not exactly repeating. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) such as Holt-Winters. But with only 4 seasons (days) of data, it might be challenging to fit.\n\n 6. Another approach: use an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA). However, with only 96 points, the model might be over-parameterized.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can try a simple method: \n    - We can compute the average of the same hour across the 4 days and then adjust by the last day's deviation? \n    - Or we can use the last day (2016-12-27) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? \n\n 8. However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern but also a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n    The data from 2016-12-24 to 2016-12-27:\n        Dec 24: values from 0.426 down to -2.487 and then up to -1.812\n        Dec 25: from -0.711 to -2.736 and then to -0.640\n        Dec 26: from -0.178 to -3.269 and then to -0.924\n        Dec 27: from -0.320 to -2.239 and then to -0.355\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. The values are fluctuating.\n\n 9. We can use a seasonal naive approach for the next 24 hours (using the previous day's same hour) and then repeat for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the next 96 hours are 4 days. We can use the last day (2016-12-27) as the first day of the forecast, then the day before (2016-12-26) as the second, then 2016-12-25, then 2016-12-24? \n    That would be a naive approach without any adjustment.\n\n    However, that would be just repeating the last 4 days in reverse? That doesn't make sense.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. \n\n    For example, for 00:00:00, we have:\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00: 0.426\n        2016-12-25 00:00:00: -0.711\n        2016-12-26 00:00:00: -0.178\n        2016-12-27 00:00:00: -0.320\n\n        Average = (0.426 -0.711 -0.178 -0.320)/4 = (0.426 - 1.209) = -0.783/4 = -0.19575\n\n    Then for the next 00:00:00 (2016-12-28 00:00:00) we use -0.19575.\n\n    But this would be a constant for each hour? We do the same for each hour of the day.\n\n 11. However, we note that the pattern might be changing. Another idea: use the last day (2016-12-27) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day to the current day for each hour.\n\n    For example, for 00:00:00:\n        Day 2 (25th) relative to Day 1 (24th): -0.711 - 0.426 = -1.137\n        Day 3 (26th) relative to Day 2 (25th): -0.178 - (-0.711) = 0.533\n        Day 4 (27th) relative to Day 3 (26th): -0.320 - (-0.178) = -0.142\n\n        Average change = (-1.137 + 0.533 -0.142)/3 = (-0.746)/3 = -0.2487\n\n        Then forecast for 00:00:00 on 28th: last value (27th 00:00:00) + average change = -0.320 -0.2487 = -0.5687\n\n    But this method is also very simple and might not capture the seasonality.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the data size, we can use a simple seasonal naive method: use the same hour from the previous day. \n     Since we are forecasting 4 days, we can use the last 4 days to form the next 4 days? But that would be repeating the same 4 days? \n\n     Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-27) for the first forecast day (2016-12-28), then the day before (2016-12-26) for 2016-12-29, then 2016-12-25 for 2016-12-30, and 2016-12-24 for 2016-12-31.\n\n     But that would be:\n\n        2016-12-28 00:00:00 = 2016-12-27 00:00:00 = -0.320\n        2016-12-28 01:00:00 = 2016-12-27 01:00:00 = -0.213\n        ... until 2016-12-28 23:00:00 = 2016-12-27 23:00:00 = -0.355\n\n        Then 2016-12-29 00:00:00 = 2016-12-26 00:00:00 = -0.178\n        ... and so on.\n\n     This method is simple and might capture the daily pattern, but it cycles the last 4 days. However, we don't have a reason to believe that the pattern will cycle exactly.\n\n 13. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. This would smooth out the daily pattern and then we use that average pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n     For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days. Then we use that average for each day in the forecast.\n\n     Example for hour 0: average = (0.426, -0.711, -0.178, -0.320) -> -0.19575\n     Then for each day in the forecast, at 00:00:00 we use -0.19575.\n\n     This would give the same value for the same hour every day. So the forecast for the next 4 days would be the same daily pattern repeated.\n\n 14. We can also consider a drift? But the data doesn't show a clear trend.\n\n 15. Given the above, I choose the average method (method 13) because it is simple and might capture the typical daily pattern.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   - Group by hour (ignoring the date, only by the time of day: 0,1,...,23)\n   - For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values we have.\n\n   Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign:\n        Day 1 (2016-12-28): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n        Day 2 (2016-12-29): same as above\n        Day 3 (2016-12-30): same\n        Day 4 (2016-12-31): same\n\n 16. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days and they are consecutive. They are around Christmas. The next 4 days are also in the same week? \n     However, without more data, we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 17. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (0.426, -0.711, -0.178, -0.320) -> (-0.783) / 4 = -0.19575\n        hour1: (0.320, -1.173, -0.071, -0.213) -> (0.320 -1.173 -0.071 -0.213) = (-1.137) /4 = -0.28425\n        hour2: (0.213, -0.817, -0.071, -0.711) -> (0.213 -0.817 -0.071 -0.711) = (-1.386) /4 = -0.3465\n        hour3: (0.036, -1.670, 0.000, -0.995) -> (0.036 -1.670 +0 -0.995) = (-2.629) /4 = -0.65725\n        hour4: (-0.284, -0.640, -0.711, -0.675) -> (-0.284 -0.640 -0.711 -0.675) = (-2.31) /4 = -0.5775\n        hour5: (-0.640, -1.919, -1.706, 0.000) -> (-0.640 -1.919 -1.706 +0) = (-4.265) /4 = -1.06625\n        hour6: (-0.782, -1.990, -1.883, -0.426) -> (-0.782 -1.990 -1.883 -0.426) = (-5.081) /4 = -1.27025\n        hour7: (-0.604, -2.630, -1.883, -0.426) -> (-0.604 -2.630 -1.883 -0.426) = (-5.543) /4 = -1.38575\n        hour8: (-0.355, -1.528, -0.497, -0.426) -> (-0.355 -1.528 -0.497 -0.426) = (-2.806) /4 = -0.7015\n        hour9: (-1.812, -1.421, -1.208, 0.000) -> (-1.812 -1.421 -1.208 +0) = (-4.441) /4 = -1.11025\n        hour10: (-1.315, -1.315, -0.107, -0.249) -> (-1.315 -1.315 -0.107 -0.249) = (-2.986) /4 = -0.7465\n        hour11: (-1.173, -1.670, -1.279, -0.355) -> (-1.173 -1.670 -1.279 -0.355) = (-4.477) /4 = -1.11925\n        hour12: (-1.777, -1.954, -1.635, -1.457) -> (-1.777 -1.954 -1.635 -1.457) = (-6.823) /4 = -1.70575\n        hour13: (-0.675, -1.315, -1.564, -0.497) -> (-0.675 -1.315 -1.564 -0.497) = (-4.051) /4 = -1.01275\n        hour14: (-1.208, -1.492, -0.924, -0.320) -> (-1.208 -1.492 -0.924 -0.320) = (-3.944) /4 = -0.986\n        hour15: (-1.279, -0.391, -0.746, -0.462) -> (-1.279 -0.391 -0.746 -0.462) = (-2.878) /4 = -0.7195\n        hour16: (-1.564, -1.421, -1.066, -0.746) -> (-1.564 -1.421 -1.066 -0.746) = (-4.797) /4 = -1.19925\n        hour17: (-1.848, -1.706, -1.457, -0.782) -> (-1.848 -1.706 -1.457 -0.782) = (-5.793) /4 = -1.44825\n        hour18: (-1.706, -1.883, -2.203, -1.421) -> (-1.706 -1.883 -2.203 -1.421) = (-7.213) /4 = -1.80325\n        hour19: (-1.635, -1.990, -1.777, -1.457) -> (-1.635 -1.990 -1.777 -1.457) = (-6.859) /4 = -1.71475\n        hour20: (-1.812, -2.025, -2.061, -1.635) -> (-1.812 -2.025 -2.061 -1.635) = (-7.533) /4 = -1.88325\n        hour21: (-2.487, -2.736, -3.269, -2.239) -> (-2.487 -2.736 -3.269 -2.239) = (-10.731) /4 = -2.68275\n        hour22: (-1.670, -1.777, -0.995, -0.213) -> (-1.670 -1.777 -0.995 -0.213) = (-4.655) /4 = -1.16375\n        hour23: (-1.812, -0.640, -0.924, -0.355) -> (-1.812 -0.640 -0.924 -0.355) = (-3.731) /4 = -0.93275\n\n 18. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-12-28 to 2016-12-31) will be the same 24 values repeated for each day.\n\n 19. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-28 00:00:00 (next after 2016-12-27 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-12-28 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We'll create 96 rows: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n 21. Format: \n        date (as string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'), then the MULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 22. Example for 2016-12-28 00:00:00: -0.196 (rounded from -0.19575)\n        2016-12-28 01:00:00: -0.284 (rounded from -0.28425) -> but we should round to 3 decimals.\n\n 23. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 24. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We'll round the computed averages to 3 decimals.\n\n 25. We do:\n\n        hour0: -0.196\n        hour1: -0.284\n        hour2: -0.347\n        hour3: -0.657\n        hour4: -0.578\n        hour5: -1.066\n        hour6: -1.270\n        hour7: -1.386\n        hour8: -0.702\n        hour9: -1.110\n        hour10: -0.747\n        hour11: -1.119\n        hour12: -1.706\n        hour13: -1.013\n        hour14: -0.986\n        hour15: -0.720\n        hour16: -1.199\n        hour17: -1.448\n        hour18: -1.803\n        hour19: -1.715\n        hour20: -1.883\n        hour21: -2.683\n        hour22: -1.164\n        hour23: -0.933\n\n 26. Then for each day in the forecast period, we assign these 24 values.\n\n 27. Write the data in the required format.\n\n 28. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are forecasting without gaps? So we output 96 complete points.\n\n 29. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-28 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2016-12-29 00:00:00 to 2016-12-29 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2016-12-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-30 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2016-12-31 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00\n\n 30. We'll create a list of these dates and then assign the corresponding hour's average.\n\n Implementation:\n\n        hours = [0,1,...,23] and we have the list of 24 average values.\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n\n        Start date: 2016-12-28 00:00:00\n\n 31. We'll generate the dates and the MULL value accordingly.\n\n 32. Finally, output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date string]  [value]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 33. We write 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the generation in Python-like pseudocode, but we are to output text.\n\n Steps:\n\n   avg_values = [-0.196, -0.284, -0.347, -0.657, -0.578, -1.066, -1.270, -1.386, -0.702, -1.110, -0.747, -1.119, \n                 -1.706, -1.013, -0.986, -0.720, -1.199, -1.448, -1.803, -1.715, -1.883, -2.683, -1.164, -0.933]\n\n   start_date = datetime(2016, 12,28, 0,0,0)   # 2016-12-28 00:00:00\n\n   for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n        for hour in range(24):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(days=day_offset, hours=hour)\n            mull = avg_values[hour]\n            print(f\"{current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}  {mull:.3f}\")\n\n 34. But note: the input data has negative values with 3 decimal places, so we format to 3 decimals.\n\n 35. However, we computed the averages and rounded to 3 decimals? Actually, we did the rounding in step 25.\n\n 36. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 37. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
