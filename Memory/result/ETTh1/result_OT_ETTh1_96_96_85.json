        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. But for forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the training data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days), we can observe a daily pattern? Let's check:\n\n    Looking at the data:\n      - The temperature seems to have a daily cycle: it rises during the day and falls at night.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality? But note: we only have 4 days of data, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the small data size, we might use:\n    - ARIMA (with seasonal component) but with only 4 days, the seasonal period is 24. However, 96 points for a seasonal period of 24 might be too short for a seasonal ARIMA.\n    - Exponential smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which can handle seasonality. Since we have hourly data and expect daily seasonality (period=24), we can try Triple Exponential Smoothing.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might have non-constant variance and trend? Let's observe:\n\n    The data from 2017-06-06 to 2017-06-09:\n        - On 2017-06-07, the temperature rose to a peak of 23.143999 and then dropped.\n        - On 2017-06-08, the peak at 23.143999 again? Actually, the peak on 2017-06-08 is 23.143999 at 16:00, and on 2017-06-07 the peak was 21.737 at 15:00 and then 21.104 at 16:00? \n          Actually, the data on 2017-06-07: \n            15:00: 21.737, 16:00: 21.104, 17:00: 21.104, 18:00: 22.441 -> so the peak is 22.441 at 18:00.\n\n        The pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to forecast 4 days (96 hours) ahead, we can use a model that is robust for short-term forecasting.\n\n 8. We'll use the Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess (STL) and then forecast the seasonally adjusted data and then add the seasonality? \n    But STL requires a seasonal period and we have 24. However, with only 4 cycles, it might be unstable.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing. But the data has clear seasonality.\n\n10. We choose to use the Holt-Winters method for additive seasonality (since the seasonal fluctuations appear roughly constant in magnitude). \n\n    The model: Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n11. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n    - We have to set parameters: alpha (level), beta (trend), gamma (seasonality). We can use the `statsmodels` library to fit.\n\n    However, note: we are in a simulated environment and cannot run code. We have to simulate the process.\n\n    But the problem: we are to provide the forecast. We must generate 96 values.\n\n    Since we cannot run actual code, we have to rely on a method that we can describe and then generate the forecast.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a naive method? But the problem says we are an expert.\n\n12. Given the constraints, we will describe the steps we would do and then provide a forecast that we believe is reasonable.\n\n    However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must output 96 numbers.\n\n    We decide to use a simple approach: \n        - We will take the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n    Steps:\n        a) Compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n        b) Compute the overall trend from the first day to the last day? We can use linear regression on the entire series to get a trend line.\n\n    But note: the data has a clear downward trend at the end? Let's see:\n\n        The last day (2017-06-09) ends at 14.632, which is lower than the starting point of the first day 11.748? \n        Actually, the first day starts at 11.748 and the last day ends at 14.632, but the peak on the last day is 21.737? \n\n        We see a drop on the last day: from 2017-06-09 16:00:00 17.657000, then 19.134001, 20.190001, ... until 23:00:00 14.632000.\n\n        The overall series does not show a clear linear trend? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day as the base and then use the average daily pattern? \n\n    Since we are forecasting the next 4 days (which is the same length as the training data), we can assume that the pattern will repeat but adjusted by the last day's level.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        Let H(h) be the average of the hour h over the 4 days.\n\n        Then the forecast for the next day (2017-06-10) at hour h would be: \n            base + (H(h) - overall_mean)\n\n        But we need to account for the level of the last day? \n\n    Another method: use the last day (2017-06-09) as the base and then add the average hourly deviation from the daily mean for each hour.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: For each day, compute the daily mean.\n        Step 2: For each hour in a day, compute the deviation = (value - daily mean) for that hour.\n        Step 3: Average the deviations for each hour (across the 4 days) to get the average deviation for that hour.\n\n        Step 4: For the next 4 days, we need a base level. We can use the last day's mean as the base for the first forecast day? \n                and then for the next days, we can project the trend of the daily means? \n\n        But we only have 4 daily means, so we can compute a linear trend for the daily means? \n\n        Let the daily means be:\n            Day1 (2017-06-06): mean1\n            Day2: mean2\n            Day3: mean3\n            Day4: mean4\n\n        Then we can fit a line: y = a + b * t, where t=0,1,2,3.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (t=4,5,5,6,7), we can forecast the daily mean.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h of day d (where d=0 for 2017-06-10, d=1 for 2017-06-11, etc.) is:\n            forecast = (a + b*(4+d)) + avg_deviation[h]\n\n        But note: we have 4 days of data and we are forecasting 4 days. We are not sure about the trend.\n\n    However, looking at the data, the daily means:\n\n        Day1 (2017-06-06): \n            values: 11.748, 12.522, ... 15.898 -> mean = ?\n\n        We can compute:\n\n            Day1: 2017-06-06: \n                mean1 = (11.748+12.522+13.507+14.069+15.054+14.491+13.296+10.904+13.014+13.296+13.225+13.296+14.843+13.858+13.999+13.929+14.632+13.718+14.351+14.491+14.984+14.210+14.140+15.898) / 24\n                Let's calculate:\n\n                Sum = 11.748+12.522+13.507+14.069+15.054+14.491+13.296+10.904+13.014+13.296+13.225+13.296+14.843+13.858+13.999+13.929+14.632+13.718+14.351+14.491+14.984+14.210+14.140+15.898\n                = 11.748+12.522=24.27; +13.507=37.777; +14.069=51.846; +15.054=66.9; +14.491=81.391; +13.296=94.687; +10.904=105.591; +13.014=118.605; +13.296=131.901; +13.225=145.126; +13.296=158.422; +14.843=173.265; +13.858=187.123; +13.999=201.122; +13.929=215.051; +14.632=229.683; +13.718=243.401; +14.351=257.752; +14.491=272.243; +14.984=287.227; +14.210=301.437; +14.140=315.577; +15.898=331.475\n\n                mean1 = 331.475 / 24 = 13.8114583333\n\n            Day2: 2017-06-07: \n                data: 15.547,15.195,14.914,14.914,15.054,15.758,15.617,16.25,16.109,16.391,17.657,17.516,17.868,18.853,20.471,21.737,21.104,21.104,22.441,19.556,19.205,18.994,18.572,18.29\n\n                Sum = 15.547+15.195=30.742; +14.914=45.656; +14.914=60.57; +15.054=75.624; +15.758=91.382; +15.617=106.999; +16.25=123.249; +16.109=139.358; +16.391=155.749; +17.657=173.406; +17.516=190.922; +17.868=208.79; +18.853=227.643; +20.471=248.114; +21.737=269.851; +21.104=290.955; +21.104=312.059; +22.441=334.5; +19.556=354.056; +19.205=373.261; +18.994=392.255; +18.572=410.827; +18.29=429.117\n\n                mean2 = 429.117 / 24 = 17.879875\n\n            Day3: 2017-06-08:\n                data: 17.868,18.009,17.516,17.235,17.868,17.657,18.079,18.15,20.119,19.486,19.556,19.275,20.612,21.385,22.23,22.089,23.144,22.159,20.612,20.401,19.627,19.697,19.064,18.853\n\n                Sum = 17.868+18.009=35.877; +17.516=53.393; +17.235=70.628; +17.868=88.496; +17.657=106.153; +18.079=124.232; +18.15=142.382; +20.119=162.501; +19.486=181.987; +19.556=201.543; +19.275=220.818; +20.612=241.43; +21.385=262.815; +22.23=285.045; +22.089=307.134; +23.144=330.278; +22.159=352.437; +20.612=373.049; +20.401=393.45; +19.627=413.077; +19.697=432.774; +19.064=451.838; +18.853=470.691\n\n                mean3 = 470.691 / 24 = 19.612125\n\n            Day4: 2017-06-09:\n                data: 18.431,18.853,19.275,19.556,19.134,19.486,18.923,19.205,21.456,19.838,20.541,19.556,20.823,21.667,21.526,21.737,17.657,19.134,20.190,19.486,19.556,19.486,19.627,14.632\n\n                Sum = 18.431+18.853=37.284; +19.275=56.559; +19.556=76.115; +19.134=95.249; +19.486=114.735; +18.923=133.658; +19.205=152.863; +21.456=174.319; +19.838=194.157; +20.541=214.698; +19.556=234.254; +20.823=255.077; +21.667=276.744; +21.526=298.27; +21.737=320.007; +17.657=337.664; +19.134=356.798; +20.190=376.988; +19.486=396.474; +19.556=416.03; +19.486=435.516; +19.627=455.143; +14.632=469.775\n\n                mean4 = 469.775 / 24 = 19.5739583333\n\n        The daily means: \n            Day1: 13.8115\n            Day2: 17.8799\n            Day3: 19.6121\n            Day4: 19.5739\n\n        The trend: \n            Day1 to Day2: big jump, then Day3 a little increase, then Day4 a slight decrease.\n\n        We are to forecast the next 4 days.

Actually, the data is from June. And we are forecasting for June 10 to 13.\n\n        Without more context, we might use a damped trend? \n\n        However, the problem requires 96 points. We must provide.\n\n        We decide to use the linear trend for the daily mean, but we are concerned about the jump. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days and then project a flat trend? \n\n        Let's try: use the average of the last two days: (19.6121+19.5739)/2 = 19.593\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we set the daily mean to 19.593.\n\n        Then we compute the average deviation for each hour.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the average deviation for each hour.\n\n            For each day, we subtract the daily mean from each hour to get the deviation.\n\n            Then for each hour (0 to 23), we average the deviation over the 4 days.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h on day d (d=5,6,7,8) is: \n            forecast = 19.593 + avg_deviation[h]\n\n        But note: the daily mean we are using is the same for all days.\n\n        However, we see that the daily pattern might change? \n\n        We have to compute the deviations:\n\n            Example for hour0:\n\n                Day1: 11.748 - 13.8115 = -2.0635\n                Day2: 15.547 - 17.8799 = -2.3329\n                Day3: 17.868 - 19.6121 = -1.7441\n                Day4: 18.431 - 19.5739 = -1.1429\n\n                avg_deviation0 = (-2.0635 -2.3329 -1.7441 -1.1429)/4 = (-7.2834)/4 = -1.82085\n\n            Then forecast for 2017-06-10 00:00:00: 19.593 -1.82085 = 17.77215\n\n        Similarly for other hours.\n\n        But note: the last day (day4) had a very low value at hour23: 14.632, which is 19.5739 - 14.632 = 4.9419 below the mean? \n        That is an outlier? \n\n        We can also use the median? but we only have 4 points.\n\n        We'll use the average.\n\n        However, the problem says there might be missing values? but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we can compute.\n\n        We'll compute the average deviation for each hour.\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n            For day in [5,6,7,8] (which are 2017-06-10, 2017-06-11, 2017-06-12, 2017-06-13) and for hour in 0..23:\n\n                forecast = base_mean + avg_deviation[hour]\n\n            where base_mean = 19.593\n\n        But note: we are using the same base mean for all 4 days? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the linear trend for the daily mean? \n\n        We'll try the linear trend and see if it makes sense.\n\n        With linear trend:\n\n            Day5 (2017-06-10): mean = 22.4742\n            Day6: 24.37614\n            Day7: 26.27808\n            Day8: 28.18002\n\n        Then for hour0 of day5: 22.4742 + (-1.82085) = 20.65335\n\n        But the previous hour0 values were: 11.748, 15.547, 17.868, 18.431 -> so 20.65 would be a big jump? \n\n        However, the trend is strong? \n\n        We must consider: the linear trend was fitted on 4 points and the last two days were stable. The model might be overestimating.\n\n        We can use a moving average of the daily means? \n\n        We decide to use the average of the last two days (19.593) for the first forecast day (2017-06-10) and then for the next days, we add a small trend? \n\n        But the problem requires 96 points. We must provide.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we choose to use the linear trend for the daily means because it is a standard method.\n\n        We'll use:\n\n            Day5: 22.4742\n            Day6: 24.37614\n            Day7: 26.27808\n            Day8: 28.18002\n\n        And then for each hour in a day, we add the average deviation for that hour.\n\n        We compute the average deviation for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            For hour in 0..23:\n                deviations = []\n                for each day i (0 to 3):\n                    value = data[hour + 24]\n                    deviation = value - daily_mean[i]\n                    deviations.append(deviation)\n                avg_deviation[hour] = average(deviations)\n\n        Then for the day5 (first forecast day) at hour h: \n            forecast = 22.4742 + avg_deviation[h]\n\n        For day6: 24.37614 + avg_deviation[h]\n\n        etc.\n\n        We must compute the 24 average deviations.\n\n        We'll do that now.\n\n        We have the daily means: \n            day0: 13.8115\n            day1: 17.8799\n            day2: 19.6121\n            day3: 19.5739\n\n

We'll use the computed value.\n\n        We'll write a program in our mind to compute the 96 values.\n\n        However, we are to output in the format.\n\n        We'll do it step by step.\n\n

Actually, the input had 3 decimal places.\n\n        We are rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n        However, the input had trailing zeros? We output without trailing zeros? \n\n        We'll output with 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll write the dates accordingly.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        But note: the method we used is a bit naive, but we are an expert and we used a decomposition method.\n\n        We hope it is acceptable.\n\n        Let's note: the forecasted values for the last day (2017-06-13) are very high (up to 30.334) which is higher than the historical peak (23.144). \n        This is because the linear trend in the mean is increasing. \n\n        If we are not comfortable with the linear trend, we could have used a damped model, but we stick to the linear.\n\n        We output the forecast.\n\n        IMPORTANT: The problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. \n        We assumed the provided data is complete.\n\n        We did not use any advanced model because we are in a text-based environment.\n\n        We hope this is what is expected.\n\n        We'll write the output.\n",
