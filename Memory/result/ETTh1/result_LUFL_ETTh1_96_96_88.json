        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). We can observe patterns repeating every day.\n 2. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not. So we assume that the provided 96 points are complete, but we must be cautious for the forecast.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data has seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. Given the hourly data and daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal naive method, or more sophisticated models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.\n\n However, note: We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate 96 values.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the requirement for a complete answer, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day (or the last available same hour). But note: we have 4 days of data. We can take the last day (2017-06-21) as the pattern for the next days? Or average of the same hour over the 4 days?\n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we can use the available data to model.\n\n However, without a model fitting, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Use the last day (2017-06-21) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But let's check the pattern of 2017-06-21:\n\n 00:00: 2.071\n 01:00: 1.949\n 02:00: 1.919\n 03:00: 2.132\n 04:00: 2.102\n 05:00: 2.924\n 06:00: 2.985\n 07:00: 3.229\n 08:00: 3.168\n 09:00: 3.320\n 10:00: 3.655\n 11:00: 3.472\n 12:00: 2.863\n 13:00: 2.833\n 14:00: 2.741\n 15:00: 2.680\n 16:00: 2.528\n 17:00: 3.107\n 18:00: 2.985\n 19:00: 2.528\n 20:00: 3.076\n 21:00: 2.924\n 22:00: 2.650\n 23:00: 2.467\n\n But we see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. Also, the previous days show some variation.\n\n Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the 4 days we have.\n\n However, note: we have 4 days? Actually, from 2017-06-18 to 2017-06-21: that's 4 days (96 hours).\n\n We can compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n For example, for hour 00:00: \n  2017-06-18: 2.528\n  2017-06-19: 2.102\n  2017-06-20: 2.102\n  2017-06-21: 2.071\n  Average = (2.528 + 2.102 + 2.102 + 2.071) / 4 = 2.20075\n\n Similarly for other hours.\n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values? In the provided data we don't have missing, so we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n However, if we are to forecast 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour for the next 4 days.\n\n But wait: what if there is a trend? The data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days. It fluctuates.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without a model fitting, the average per hour is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n  - Group the data by hour (i.e., 0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n However, note: the data starts at 2017-06-18 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-06-21 23:00:00, which is exactly 4 days.\n\n We can create 24 groups (each hour of the day) and average the 4 values for each hour.\n\n Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the problem says \"missing values\" in the data? We are not given any missing in the provided 96, so we assume we can compute the average.\n\n However, if we are to be robust to missing values in the future, we are not required to handle missing in the forecast because we are generating the forecast. The problem says the data we are given has missing values, but the provided 96 are complete. So we proceed.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (2.528 + 2.102 + 2.102 + 2.071) /4 = (2.528+2.102+2.102+2.071)/4 = 8.803/4 = 2.20075\n Hour 1: (2.437 + 2.041 + 1.828 + 1.949) /4 = (2.437+2.041+1.828+1.949)/4 = 8.255/4 = 2.06375\n Hour 2: (2.376 + 2.071 + 1.767 + 1.919) /4 = (2.376+2.071+1.767+1.919)/4 = 8.133/4 = 2.03325\n Hour 3: (2.619 + 2.132 + 1.858 + 2.132) /4 = (2.619+2.132+1.858+2.132)/4 = 8.741/4 = 2.18525\n Hour 4: (2.284 + 2.041 + 1.888 + 2.102) /4 = (2.284+2.041+1.888+2.102)/4 = 8.315/4 = 2.07875\n Hour 5: (3.107 + 2.650 + 2.619 + 2.924) /4 = (3.107+2.650+2.619+2.924)/4 = 11.3/4 = 2.825\n Hour 6: (3.350 + 2.772 + 2.924 + 2.985) /4 = (3.350+2.772+2.924+2.985)/4 = 12.031/4 = 3.00775\n Hour 7: (3.777 + 2.924 + 2.711 + 3.229) /4 = (3.777+2.924+2.711+3.229)/4 = 12.641/4 = 3.16025\n Hour 8: (3.168 + 2.650 + 2.711 + 3.168) /4 = (3.168+2.650+2.711+3.168)/4 = 11.697/4 = 2.92425\n Hour 9: (3.655 + 2.589 + 3.290 + 3.320) /4 = (3.655+2.589+3.290+3.320)/4 = 12.854/4 = 3.2135\n Hour 10: (3.990 + 3.046 + 3.350 + 3.655) /4 = (3.990+3.046+3.350+3.655)/4 = 14.041/4 = 3.51025\n Hour 11: (4.234 + 3.564 + 3.381 + 3.472) /4 = (4.234+3.564+3.381+3.472)/4 = 14.651/4 = 3.66275\n Hour 12: (3.381 + 2.833 + 2.680 + 2.863) /4 = (3.381+2.833+2.680+2.863)/4 = 11.757/4 = 2.93925\n Hour 13: (2.802 + 2.589 + 3.442 + 2.833) /4 = (2.802+2.589+3.442+2.833)/4 = 11.666/4 = 2.9165\n Hour 14: (2.985 + 2.863 + 2.833 + 2.741) /4 = (2.985+2.863+2.833+2.741)/4 = 11.422/4 = 2.8555\n Hour 15: (2.589 + 2.985 + 2.985 + 2.680) /4 = (2.589+2.985+2.985+2.680)/4 = 11.239/4 = 2.80975\n Hour 16: (2.711 + 3.076 + 3.290 + 2.528) /4 = (2.711+3.076+3.290+2.528)/4 = 11.605/4 = 2.90125\n Hour 17: (2.863 + 3.350 + 3.503 + 3.107) /4 = (2.863+3.350+3.503+3.107)/4 = 12.823/4 = 3.20575\n Hour 18: (2.924 + 3.076 + 3.107 + 2.985) /4 = (2.924+3.076+3.107+2.985)/4 = 12.092/4 = 3.023\n Hour 19: (2.894 + 3.076 + 3.137 + 2.528) /4 = (2.894+3.076+3.137+2.528)/4 = 11.635/4 = 2.90875\n Hour 20: (2.802 + 3.198 + 2.955 + 3.076) /4 = (2.802+3.198+2.955+3.076)/4 = 12.031/4 = 3.00775\n Hour 21: (2.985 + 2.711 + 3.290 + 2.924) /4 = (2.985+2.711+3.290+2.924)/4 = 11.91/4 = 2.9775\n Hour 22: (2.589 + 2.315 + 3.015 + 2.650) /4 = (2.589+2.315+3.015+2.650)/4 = 10.569/4 = 2.64225\n Hour 23: (2.589 + 2.376 + 2.741 + 2.467) /4 = (2.589+2.376+2.741+2.467)/4 = 10.173/4 = 2.54325\n\n Then, the next 4 days (from 2017-06-22 to 2017-06-25) will be:\n\n Day 1 (2017-06-22): [2.20075, 2.06375, 2.03325, 2.18525, 2.07875, 2.825, 3.00775, 3.16025, 2.92425, 3.2135, 3.51025, 3.66275, 2.93925, 2.9165, 2.8555, 2.80975, 2.90125, 3.20575, 3.023, 2.90875, 3.00775, 2.9775, 2.64225, 2.54325]\n Day 2 (2017-06-23): same as above\n Day 3 (2017-06-24): same as above\n Day 4 (2017-06-25): same as above\n\n But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? We are generating the forecast without missing. So we output the 96 values.\n\n However, we must format the dates correctly.\n\n The last date in the given data is 2017-06-21 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n 2017-06-22 01:00:00\n ...\n 2017-06-22 23:00:00\n 2017-06-23 00:00:00\n ...\n 2017-06-25 23:00:00\n\n We'll generate 96 records.\n\n But note: the average method might be too simplistic. However, without a more sophisticated model and given the requirement, we use this.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a model like SARIMA, but that requires parameter tuning and we don't have the tools here. Since we are to provide the complete data, we go with the average method.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n However, the input has 3 decimal places. So we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's recalculate and round:\n\n Hour 0: 2.201\n Hour 1: 2.064\n Hour 2: 2.033\n Hour 3: 2.185\n Hour 4: 2.079\n Hour 5: 2.825\n Hour 6: 3.008\n Hour 7: 3.160\n Hour 8: 2.924\n Hour 9: 3.214\n Hour 10: 3.510\n Hour 11: 3.663\n Hour 12: 2.939\n Hour 13: 2.917\n Hour 14: 2.856\n Hour 15: 2.810\n Hour 16: 2.901\n Hour 17: 3.206\n Hour 18: 3.023\n Hour 19: 2.909\n Hour 20: 3.008\n Hour 21: 2.978\n Hour 22: 2.642\n Hour 23: 2.543\n\n Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n We'll generate the dates and the LUFL values.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Start date: 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n End date: 2017-06-25 23:00:00\n\n We'll create 96 rows.\n\n Format:\n\n<answer>\n\n```\n2017-06-22 00:00:00 2.201\n2017-06-22 01:00:00 2.064\n2017-06-22 02:00:00 2.033\n2017-06-22 03:00:00 2.185\n2017-06-22 04:00:00 2.079\n2017-06-22 05:00:00 2.825\n2017-06-22 06:00:00 3.008\n2017-06-22 07:00:00 3.160\n2017-06-22 08:00:00 2.924\n2017-06-22 09:00:00 3.214\n2017-06-22 10:00:00 3.510\n2017-06-22 11:00:00 3.663\n2017-06-22 12:00:00 2.939\n2017-06-22 13:00:00 2.917\n2017-06-22 14:00:00 2.856\n2017-06-22 15:00:00 2.810\n2017-06-22 16:00:00 2.901\n2017-06-22 17:00:00 3.206\n2017-06-22 18:00:00 3.023\n2017-06-22 19:00:00 2.909\n2017-06-22 20:00:00 3.008\n2017-06-22 21:00:00 2.978\n2017-06-22 22:00:00 2.642\n2017-06-22 23:00:00 2.543\n2017-06-23 00:00:00 2.201\n2017-06-23 01:00:00 2.064\n...

You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll output the 96 lines in the required format.\n\n However, we must note that the average method might not capture the most recent trend. But without more data and without a model, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n We'll output the data.\n\n Important: The problem says the data has missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing. So we output the 96 values without missing.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required format.\n",
