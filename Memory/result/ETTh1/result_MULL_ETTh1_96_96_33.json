        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are missing values? But in the provided data, we have 96 consecutive points without any missing values in the given segment.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But the provided past 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and the frequency is hourly, we can consider:\n    - The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not feasible.\n\n 3. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is exactly 4 days) and we have 4 days of history, we can try to capture the daily pattern.\n\n 4. We note that the data has fluctuations and some outliers (like 5.828, 5.259 on 2016-11-11). We must be robust to these.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can use a simple seasonal model. One common method is the Seasonal Naive method, which uses the value from the same time in the previous season (i.e., same hour of the previous day) as the forecast.\n\n    However, we have 4 days of data. We can compute the average of the same hour over the available days? But note: the pattern might not be stable.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA (SARIMA) models. But with only 96 points, a complex model might overfit.\n\n 7. Given the requirement for 96 points and the short history, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n    Let's try: For a given hour (say 00:00), we have 4 values: \n        2016-11-10 00:00:00 -> 3.767\n        2016-11-11 00:00:00 -> 3.020\n        2016-11-12 00:00:00 -> 3.092\n        2016-11-13 00:00:00 -> 3.802\n\n    We can take the average of these for the next 00:00? But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n        Day1: 3.767\n        Day2: 3.020\n        Day3: 3.092\n        Day4: 3.802\n\n    The average is (3.767+3.020+3.092+3.802)/4 = 3.42025.\n\n    Then for 2016-11-14 00:00:00, we can use 3.42025? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2016-11-13) as the base and adjust by the average change? But that might be complex.\n\n 9. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have exactly 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any missing. So for forecasting, we assume the pattern of the past 4 days will repeat.\n\n    But we see that the values are not exactly repeating. So we can use the average.\n\n 10. Steps for the average method:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days (from 2016-11-14 to 2016-11-17), we compute:\n            forecast_h = (value of h on 2016-11-10 + value of h on 2016-11-11 + value of h on 2016-11-12 + value of h on 2016-11-13) / 4\n\n    This will give us 24 distinct values, and we repeat the same 24 values for each of the 4 days? But note: the next 96 hours are 4 full days.\n\n    However, we must note: the pattern might change slightly day to day. But with only 4 days, we don't have a better way.\n\n 11. But let's the alternative? We can use a naive seasonal method: use the same hour from the previous day. For the first day of forecast (2016-11-14) we use the values from 2016-11-13. Then for 2016-11-15, we use the values from 2016-11-14 (which we just forecasted) and so on? That would propagate errors.\n\n 12. Given the requirement, we choose the average method for each hour over the 4 available days.\n\n 13. How to handle the dates? We need to generate the next 96 hours starting from 2016-11-14 00:00:00.\n\n    The last date in the given data: 2016-11-13 23:00:00.\n\n    Next hour: 2016-11-14 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n\n 14. We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1 (10th): 3.767\n        Day2 (11th): 3.020\n        Day3 (12th): 3.092\n        Day4 (13th): 3.802\n        Average = (3.767+3.020+3.092+3.802)/4 = 3.42025\n\n    Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: 3.625\n        Day2: 3.127\n        Day3: 3.553\n        Day4: 4.051\n        Average = (3.625+3.127+3.553+4.051)/4 = 3.589\n\n    And so on for all 24 hours.\n\n 15. Then for each day in the forecast period (4 days: 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th of November 2016), we assign the 24 average values.\n\n 16. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we assume the past data is complete for the 4 days.\n\n 17. We'll compute the 24 averages and then repeat the same 24 values for each of the 4 days.\n\n 18. However, we must note: the average might smooth out the pattern. But without a more sophisticated model, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 19. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n    We have the data in order. We can reshape the 96 points into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n    Given data: 96 rows, 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n    We can group by hour of day.\n\n 20. Steps in code (if we were coding) but we are to do manually? We have to compute 24 averages.\n\n    We'll do:\n\n        hour0: [3.767, 3.020, 3.092, 3.802] -> avg = (3.767+3.020+3.092+3.802)/4 = 3.42025\n        hour1: [3.625, 3.127, 3.553, 4.051] -> (3.625+3.127+3.553+4.051)=14.356 -> 14.356/4=3.589\n        hour2: [3.980, 2.274, 3.447, 3.518] -> (3.980+2.274+3.447+3.518)=13.219 -> 13.219/4=3.30475\n        hour3: [2.807, 5.828, 4.158, 3.767] -> (2.807+5.828+4.158+3.767)=16.56 -> 16.56/4=4.14\n        hour4: [3.198, 2.630, 3.944, 3.660] -> (3.198+2.630+3.944+3.660)=13.432 -> 13.432/4=3.358\n        hour5: [3.269, 5.259, 3.873, 3.092] -> (3.269+5.259+3.873+3.092)=15.493 -> 15.493/4=3.87325\n        hour6: [3.447, 3.767, 3.092, 3.127] -> (3.447+3.767+3.092+3.127)=13.433 -> 13.433/4=3.35825\n        hour7: [3.056, 2.239, 3.305, 2.772] -> (3.056+2.239+3.305+2.772)=11.372 -> 11.372/4=2.843\n        hour8: [3.447, 2.736, 3.127, 2.097] -> (3.447+2.736+3.127+2.097)=11.407 -> 11.407/4=2.85175\n        hour9: [3.092, 1.919, 2.345, 2.274] -> (3.092+1.919+2.345+2.274)=9.63 -> 9.63/4=2.4075\n        hour10: [2.061, 1.954, 2.203, 2.665] -> (2.061+1.954+2.203+2.665)=8.883 -> 8.883/4=2.22075\n        hour11: [2.416, 2.274, 2.274, 2.345] -> (2.416+2.274+2.274+2.345)=9.309 -> 9.309/4=2.32725\n        hour12: [1.954, 1.706, 1.670, 1.883] -> (1.954+1.706+1.670+1.883)=7.213 -> 7.213/4=1.80325\n        hour13: [2.949, 1.528, 2.097, 2.310] -> (2.949+1.528+2.097+2.310)=8.884 -> 8.884/4=2.221\n        hour14: [3.234, 2.487, 2.523, 2.807] -> (3.234+2.487+2.523+2.807)=11.051 -> 11.051/4=2.76275\n        hour15: [2.914, 2.452, 2.630, 1.954] -> (2.914+2.452+2.630+1.954)=9.95 -> 9.95/4=2.4875\n        hour16: [2.736, 2.132, 2.310, 2.381] -> (2.736+2.132+2.310+2.381)=9.559 -> 9.559/4=2.38975\n        hour17: [2.132, 2.203, 2.132, 2.097] -> (2.132+2.203+2.132+2.097)=8.564 -> 8.564/4=2.141\n        hour18: [1.919, 1.919, 1.706, 1.777] -> (1.919+1.919+1.706+1.777)=7.321 -> 7.321/4=1.83025\n        hour19: [1.599, 1.954, 1.741, 1.528] -> (1.599+1.954+1.741+1.528)=6.822 -> 6.822/4=1.7055\n        hour20: [1.777, 1.883, 1.670, 1.564] -> (1.777+1.883+1.670+1.564)=6.894 -> 6.894/4=1.7235\n        hour21: [0.782, 1.670, 2.025, 0.533] -> (0.782+1.670+2.025+0.533)=5.01 -> 5.01/4=1.2525\n        hour22: [2.239, 3.731, 2.168, 2.594] -> (2.239+3.731+2.168+2.594)=10.732 -> 10.732/4=2.683\n        hour23: [1.635, 3.980, 3.020, 3.127] -> (1.635+3.980+3.020+3.127)=11.762 -> 11.762/4=2.9405\n\n 21. Now, we have 24 values (for hours 0 to 23) for one day. We will use these same 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 22. The forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-14: [3.42025, 3.589, 2.9405] -> the 24 values in order\n        Day 2: 2016-11-15: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2016-11-16: same 24 values\n        Day 4: 2016-11-17: same 24 values\n\n 23. We must generate the timestamps and round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 24. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-14 00:00:00 3.420\n2016-11-14 01:00:00 3.589\n... \n2016-11-17 23:00:00 2.941   [rounded from 2.9405 to 3 decimals?]\n\n```\n\n 25. But note: the input data has up to 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 26. However, we must note: the average method might not capture the dynamics, but it's a simple and common baseline.\n\n 27. Let's consider: the problem says \"Middle UseLess Load\", and we are to forecast. This method is acceptable.\n\n 28. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-14 00:00:00\n        End:   2016-11-17 23:00:00\n\n    We have 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n 29. We'll write the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimals) and repeat them 4 times.\n\n 30. The 24 averages (rounded):\n\n        hour0: 3.42025 -> 3.420\n        hour1: 3.589 -> 3.589\n        hour2: 3.30475 -> 3.305\n        hour3: 4.14 -> 4.140\n        hour4: 3.358 -> 3.358\n        hour5: 3.87325 -> 3.873\n        hour6: 3.35825 -> 3.358\n        hour7: 2.843 -> 2.843\n        hour8: 2.85175 -> 2.852\n        hour9: 2.4075 -> 2.408\n        hour10: 2.22075 -> 2.221\n        hour11: 2.32725 -> 2.327\n        hour12: 1.80325 -> 1.803\n        hour13: 2.221 -> 2.221\n        hour14: 2.76275 -> 2.763\n        hour15: 2.4875 -> 2.488\n        hour16: 2.38975 -> 2.390\n        hour17: 2.141 -> 2.141\n        hour18: 1.83025 -> 1.830\n        hour19: 1.7055 -> 1.706\n        hour20: 1.7235 -> 1.724\n        hour21: 1.2525 -> 1.253\n        hour22: 2.683 -> 2.683\n        hour23: 2.9405 -> 2.941   (because 2.9405 rounded to 3 decimals is 2.941)\n\n 31. Now, we'll write the data for 4 days with these 24 values repeated.\n\n 32. We must be cautious: the rounding. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. Generate the data:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-14\n            00:00:00 3.420\n            01:00:00 3.589\n            02:00:00 3.305\n            03:00:00 4.140\n            04:00:00 3.358\n            05:00:00 3.873\n            06:00:00 3.358\n            07:00:00 2.843\n            08:00:00 2.852\n            09:00:00 2.408\n            10:00:00 2.221\n            11:00:00 2.327\n            12:00:00 1.803\n            13:00:00 2.221\n            14:00:00 2.763\n            15:00:00 2.488\n            16:00:00 2.390\n            17:00:00 2.141\n            18:00:00 1.830\n            19:00:00 1.706\n            20:00:00 1.724\n            21:00:00 1.253\n            22:00:00 2.683\n            23:00:00 2.941\n\n        Then repeat the same for 2016-11-15, 2016-11-16, 2016-11-17.\n\n 34.
