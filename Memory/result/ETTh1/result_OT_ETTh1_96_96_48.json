        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missingness in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the relatively short history (only 4 days), we can consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly seasonality (168 hours) but we only have 4 days (96 hours) so weekly is not possible to capture. We can try to capture daily patterns.\n\n 3. Given the data length is short, we can use a simple model that can capture seasonality. One common approach for hourly data is to use a seasonal naive method, but we can also use exponential smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or even a simple linear model with time and seasonal dummies.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows fluctuations and we have only 4 days. We might also consider using an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA). But with only 96 points, we have to be cautious about overfitting.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model like Prophet, but the problem does not specify the tools we can use. Since we are to generate the forecast without any external tool, we have to rely on statistical methods.\n\n 6. Considering the constraints, we can use a simple decomposition method or a moving average.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 8. Approach:\n    - We observe that the data has a daily pattern. Let's check the average daily pattern by grouping by hour of the day.\n\n 9. We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note that the data might have a trend? Let's see:\n\n    The first day (2017-01-09) starts at 9.426 and ends at 9.989.\n    The second day (2017-01-10) starts at 10.130 and ends at 6.613.\n    The third day (2017-01-11) starts at 7.668 and ends at 9.356.\n    The fourth day (2017-01-12) starts at 10.130 and ends at 9.778.\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. So we can assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 10. Therefore, we can use the average of each hour across the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n     However, note that the last day (2017-01-12) ends at 9.778 and the next day (2017-01-13) should start at a similar level? But looking at the previous days, the starting hour (00:00) has been: 9.426, 10.130, 7.668, 10.130. The average of these is (9.426+10.130+7.668+10.130)/4 = 9.3385.\n\n     But we are going to forecast 4 days, so we can repeat the average daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 11. Steps for the average method:\n      - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then for each day in the forecast period, we use the 24 mean values.\n\n 12. However, note that the data might have some noise. We can also consider using the median? But the data doesn't have outliers, so mean is acceptable.\n\n 13. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      Hour 0: [9.426, 10.130, 7.668, 10.130] -> mean = (9.426+10.130+7.668+10.130)/4 = 9.3385\n      Hour 1: [9.778, 10.130, 7.457, 9.497] -> (9.778+10.130+7.457+9.497)/4 = 9.778+10.130=19.908; 7.457+9.497=16.954; total=36.862 -> 9.2155\n      ... and so on.\n\n 14. But wait, the data for the same hour across days might vary. We have 4 days, so we have 4 values for each hour.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average if we believe recent days are more important? But without a clear trend, we use simple average.\n\n 16. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n 17. We'll create a list of 24 average values (for hour 0 to 23).\n\n 18. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n        Day 1 (2017-01-13): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day 2 (2017-01-14): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day 3 (2017-01-15): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day 4 (2017-01-16): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n 19. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. We are not told that the forecast period has missing values? We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must fill in all 96 points.\n\n 20. We'll compute the hourly averages from the provided data.\n\n 21. Let's do the computation:\n\n      We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n      We'll group by the hour of the day (ignoring the date).\n\n 22. Steps to compute:\n\n      hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72 -> [9.426, 10.130, 7.668, 10.130] -> mean = (9.426+10.130+7.668+10.130)/4 = 9.3385\n      hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73 -> [9.778, 10.130, 7.457, 9.497] -> (9.778+10.130+7.457+9.497)/4 = 9.2155\n      hour2: indices 2, 50, 74 -> Wait, let me check: \n          Day1: 2017-01-09 02:00:00 -> 10.341\n          Day2: 2017-01-10 02:00:00 -> 10.130\n          Day3: 2017-01-11 02:00:00 -> 7.316\n          Day4: 2017-01-12 02:00:00 -> 9.638\n          So: (10.341+10.130+7.316+9.638)/4 = 9.35625\n\n      We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 23. We can write a small code in our mind, but since we are to do it manually, we'll compute each.\n\n      Let me list the data by hour:\n\n      Hour 0: 9.426, 10.130, 7.668, 10.130 -> mean = (9.426+10.130+7.668+10.130)/4 = 37.354/4 = 9.3385\n      Hour 1: 9.778, 10.130, 7.457, 9.497 -> 37.862/4 = 9.4655\n          Correction: 9.778+10.130=19.908, 7.457+9.497=16.954, total=36.862 -> 9.2155? \n          Let me recalculate: 9.778+10.130=19.908, 19.908+7.457=27.365, 27.365+9.497=36.862 -> 36.862/4=9.2155\n\n      Hour 2: 10.341, 10.130, 7.316, 9.638 -> 10.341+10.130=20.471, 7.316+9.638=16.954, total=37.425 -> 9.35625\n\n      Hour 3: 10.552, 10.060, 6.683, 9.989 -> 10.552+10.060=20.612, 6.683+9.989=16.672, total=37.284 -> 9.321\n\n      Hour 4: 9.497, 8.653, 5.135, 10.411 -> 9.497+8.653=18.15, 5.135+10.411=15.546, total=33.696 -> 8.424\n\n      Hour 5: 9.708, 7.668, 5.628, 9.215 -> 9.708+7.668=17.376, 5.628+9.215=14.843, total=32.219 -> 8.05475\n\n      Hour 6: 9.075, 7.527, 5.909, 8.512 -> 9.075+7.527=16.602, 5.909+8.512=14.421, total=31.023 -> 7.75575\n\n      Hour 7: 9.567, 7.246, 6.120, 8.442 -> 9.567+7.246=16.813, 6.120+8.442=14.562, total=31.375 -> 7.84375\n\n      Hour 8: 9.778, 7.949, 5.698, 8.020 -> 9.778+7.949=17.727, 5.698+8.020=13.718, total=31.445 -> 7.86125\n\n      Hour 9: 10.482, 8.864, 5.979, 7.105 -> 10.482+8.864=19.346, 5.979+7.105=13.084, total=32.43 -> 8.1075\n\n      Hour10: 10.552, 7.668, 5.979, 7.246 -> 10.552+7.668=18.22, 5.979+7.246=13.225, total=31.445 -> 7.86125\n\n      Hour11: 10.130, 8.371, 7.105, 7.597 -> 10.130+8.371=18.501, 7.105+7.597=14.702, total=33.203 -> 8.30075\n\n      Hour12: 10.482, 8.371, 6.753, 6.542 -> 10.482+8.371=18.853, 6.753+6.542=13.295, total=32.148 -> 8.037\n\n      Hour13: 10.200, 8.160, 7.316, 6.824 -> 10.200+8.160=18.36, 7.316+6.824=14.14, total=32.5 -> 8.125\n\n      Hour14: 10.693, 8.793, 7.386, 8.653 -> 10.693+8.793=19.486, 7.386+8.653=16.039, total=35.525 -> 8.88125\n\n      Hour15: 9.778, 8.020, 8.090, 8.020 -> 9.778+8.020=17.798, 8.090+8.020=16.11, total=33.908 -> 8.477\n\n      Hour16: 10.130, 7.527, 7.879, 7.809 -> 10.130+7.527=17.657, 7.879+7.809=15.688, total=33.345 -> 8.33625\n\n      Hour17: 8.512, 7.316, 8.020, 7.668 -> 8.512+7.316=15.828, 8.020+7.668=15.688, total=31.516 -> 7.879\n\n      Hour18: 8.512, 6.472, 9.215, 8.020 -> 8.512+6.472=14.984, 9.215+8.020=17.235, total=32.219 -> 8.05475\n\n      Hour19: 8.512, 5.909, 9.356, 9.567 -> 8.512+5.909=14.421, 9.356+9.567=18.923, total=33.344 -> 8.336\n\n      Hour20: 8.512, 6.120, 9.215, 9.567 -> 8.512+6.120=14.632, 9.215+9.567=18.782, total=33.414 -> 8.3535\n\n      Hour21: 8.512, 6.050, 9.426, 9.215 -> 8.512+6.050=14.562, 9.426+9.215=18.641, total=33.203 -> 8.30075\n\n      Hour22: 9.849, 6.402, 9.356, 9.145 -> 9.849+6.402=16.251, 9.356+9.145=18.501, total=34.752 -> 8.688\n\n      Hour23: 9.989, 6.613, 9.356, 9.778 -> 9.989+6.613=16.602, 9.356+9.778=19.134, total=35.736 -> 8.934\n\n 24. Now, we have the 24 hourly averages. We'll use these to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 25. The next 96 hours (starting from 2017-01-13 00:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-13 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.3385\n               2017-01-13 01:00:00 -> hour1: 9.2155\n               2017-01-13 02:00:00 -> hour2: 9.35625\n               ... until hour23: 8.934\n\n        Day2: 2017-01-14 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.3385\n               ... and so on.\n\n 26. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-13 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and OT) with the OT values rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 28. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n      Hour0: 9.3385 -> 9.339\n      Hour1: 9.2155 -> 9.216\n      Hour2: 9.35625 -> 9.356\n      Hour3: 9.321 -> 9.321\n      Hour4: 8.424 -> 8.424\n      Hour5: 8.05475 -> 8.055\n      Hour6: 7.75575 -> 7.756\n      Hour7: 7.84375 -> 7.844\n      Hour8: 7.86125 -> 7.861\n      Hour9: 8.1075 -> 8.108\n      Hour10: 7.86125 -> 7.861\n      Hour11: 8.30075 -> 8.301\n      Hour12: 8.037 -> 8.037\n      Hour13: 8.125 -> 8.125\n      Hour14: 8.88125 -> 8.881\n      Hour15: 8.477 -> 8.477\n      Hour16: 8.33625 -> 8.336\n      Hour17: 7.879 -> 7.879\n      Hour18: 8.05475 -> 8.055\n      Hour19: 8.336 -> 8.336\n      Hour20: 8.3535 -> 8.354\n      Hour21: 8.30075 -> 8.301\n      Hour22: 8.688 -> 8.688\n      Hour23: 8.934 -> 8.934\n\n 29. Now, we create the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-13): \n          00:00:00 -> 9.339\n          01:00:00 -> 9.216\n          02:00:00 -> 9.356\n          03:00:00 -> 9.321\n          04:00:00 -> 8.424\n          05:00:00 -> 8.055\n          06:00:00 -> 7.756\n          07:00:00 -> 7.844\n          08:00:00 -> 7.861\n          09:00:00 -> 8.108\n          10:00:00 -> 7.861\n          11:00:00 -> 8.301\n          12:00:00 -> 8.037\n          13:00:00 -> 8.125\n          14:00:00 -> 8.881\n          15:00:00 -> 8.477\n          16:00:00 -> 8.336\n          17:00:00 -> 7.879\n          18:00:00 -> 8.055\n          19:00:00 -> 8.336\n          20:00:00 -> 8.354\n          21:00:00 -> 8.301\n          22:00:00 -> 8.688\n          23:00:00 -> 8.934\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 30. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-13 00:00:00, then 2017-01-13 01:00:00, ... until 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n 31. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 32. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\n\n 33. We'll write the data as:\n\n        date,OT\n        2017-01-13 00:00:00,9.339\n        2017-01-13 01:00:00,9.216\n        ... \n\n 34. But note: the input had the date in the format: \"2017-01-09 00:00:00\" and the OT with 3 decimal places.\n\n 35. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-13\n        Day2: 2017-01-14\n        Day3: 2017-01-15\n        Day4: 2017-01-16\n\n 36. We'll create the list.\n\n 37. However, note: the data we have is for 4 days, but the next 4 days might have a different pattern? But we are using the average of the past 4 days. This is a simple and common approach for short-term forecasting when there is a clear daily seasonality and no trend.\n\n 38. We output the data.\n\n 39. Let's double-check the starting point: The last provided data point is 2017-01-12 23:00:00. The next should be 2017-01-13 00:00:00.\n\n 40. We are ready to write the answer.\n",
