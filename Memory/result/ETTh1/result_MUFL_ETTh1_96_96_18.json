        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for these 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. \n    However, the provided past 96 points do not have any missing values (no gaps). So we assume that the forecasting must account for the possibility of missing values in the future?\n    But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must output 96 values without any missing.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data, we can observe:\n    - There is a daily seasonality (24 hours) because the pattern repeats every day.\n    - The data has a clear daily cycle: higher values during the night and lower during the day? Actually, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same each day, but there is a cycle.\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a method that captures seasonality.\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day. However, the last day (2016-09-14) has a different pattern? \n    Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour? But note: the data starts at 2016-09-11 and ends at 2016-09-14, so we have 4 full days.\n\n 6. Since we have exactly 4 days (96 hours) and we need to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours), we can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note: the data does not show a consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n    Example for hour 0: \n        2016-09-11 00:00:00 -> 12.970\n        2016-09-12 00:00:00 -> 7.782\n        2016-09-13 00:00:00 -> 10.696\n        2016-09-14 00:00:00 -> 10.625\n\n    The average for hour 0: (12.970 + 7.782 + 10.696 + 10.625) / 4 = 10.51825\n\n    Then we would use 10.51825 for the next four days at 00:00:00.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n    So we can use the average method for each hour.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated method like Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) or SARIMA. However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA model might be challenging.\n\n 9. Given the simplicity and the data, we have 4 days, we can also consider using the last available day (2016-09-14) as the forecast for the next day? \n    But the problem says the data has missing values? Actually, the forecasting is for the future, so we don't have missing in the past for the training.\n\n 10. The problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing. So we assume the past is complete.\n\n 11. Approach: We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days and then use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 12. Steps for the forecast:\n      - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n      - Then for the next 96 hours (starting from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 13. Why this method?\n      - It captures the daily seasonality.\n      - It is simple and robust with small data.\n\n 14. However, note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the four days, the values at the same hour do not show a clear upward or downward trend. \n      For example, hour 0: 12.97, 7.78, 10.70, 10.63 -> no clear trend. So averaging is acceptable.\n\n 15. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We have 24 hours, so we'll compute 24 averages.\n\n 16. How to handle the dates?\n      The last date in the data is 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n      The next 96 hours will be from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n 17. Implementation:\n\n      Step 1: Extract the hour from the datetime.\n      Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean of the MUFL for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n      We have 4 days, so for each hour we have 4 observations.\n\n 18. Example for hour 0: \n        Days: 11,12,13,14 -> [12.970, 7.782, 10.696, 10.625] -> mean = (12.970+7.782+10.696+10.625)/4 = 10.51825\n\n      Similarly for hour 24 (which is same as hour 0 of the next day) we use the same value.\n\n 19. We'll create a list of 24 average values (for hours 0 to 23).\n\n 20. Then for the next 96 hours, we have 4 days * 24 hours = 96. \n        Day 1: 2016-09-15 -> hours 0 to 23: use the average for hour0, hour1, ... hour23.\n        Day 2: 2016-09-16 -> same 24 averages.\n        Day 3: 2016-09-17 -> same.\n        Day 4: 2016-09-18 -> same.\n\n 21. Format the output: \n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00, [value for hour0]\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00, [value for hour1]\n        ... until 2016-09-18 23:00:00\n\n 22. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 23. Let's compute the hourly averages from the provided data.\n\n 24. Note: The data is given in the order of increasing time. We have 4 consecutive days.\n\n 25. Code for averaging (we can do it manually since it's only 24 groups):\n\n      We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n 26. But note: the data for the same hour might vary by day. We are taking the mean.\n\n 27. Compute the averages:\n\n      hour0: [12.970, 7.782, 10.696, 10.625] -> 10.51825\n      hour1: [12.473, 7.818, 10.234, 10.021] -> (12.473+7.818+10.234+10.021)/4 = 10.1365\n      hour2: [12.686, 8.102, 10.376, 10.625] -> (12.686+8.102+10.376+10.625)/4 = 10.44725\n      hour3: [12.437, 7.356, 10.518, 7.782] -> (12.437+7.356+10.518+7.782)/4 = 9.52325\n      hour4: [10.518, 7.285, 9.985, 7.000] -> (10.518+7.285+9.985+7.000)/4 = 8.697\n      hour5: [11.194, 7.711, 10.483, 7.533] -> (11.194+7.711+10.483+7.533)/4 = 9.23025\n      hour6: [12.544, 8.031, 11.051, 8.955] -> (12.544+8.031+11.051+8.955)/4 = 10.14525\n      hour7: [11.762, 6.503, 10.447, 9.132] -> (11.762+6.503+10.447+9.132)/4 = 9.461\n      hour8: [11.513, 5.686, 9.346, 8.422] -> (11.513+5.686+9.346+8.422)/4 = 8.74175\n      hour9: [8.493, 4.904, 5.828, 6.787] -> (8.493+4.904+5.828+6.787)/4 = 6.503\n      hour10: [6.076, 5.366, 6.254, 6.929] -> (6.076+5.366+6.254+6.929)/4 = 6.15625\n      hour11: [6.219, 5.579, 6.325, 5.899] -> (6.219+5.579+6.325+5.899)/4 = 6.0055\n      hour12: [4.300, 4.584, 5.224, 4.229] -> (4.300+4.584+5.224+4.229)/4 = 4.58425\n      hour13: [4.513, 4.620, 4.584, 4.193] -> (4.513+4.620+4.584+4.193)/4 = 4.4775\n      hour14: [5.259, 4.548, 5.082, 4.726] -> (5.259+4.548+5.082+4.726)/4 = 4.90375\n      hour15: [4.300, 4.975, 5.686, 4.442] -> (4.300+4.975+5.686+4.442)/4 = 4.85075\n      hour16: [3.625, 4.406, 5.259, 4.158] -> (3.625+4.406+5.259+4.158)/4 = 4.362\n      hour17: [4.904, 5.401, 5.508, 4.264] -> (4.904+5.401+5.508+4.264)/4 = 5.01925\n      hour18: [4.548, 4.691, 4.939, 4.015] -> (4.548+4.691+4.939+4.015)/4 = 4.54825\n      hour19: [4.584, 4.904, 5.117, 4.548] -> (4.584+4.904+5.117+4.548)/4 = 4.78825\n      hour20: [4.371, 4.762, 5.046, 4.229] -> (4.371+4.762+5.046+4.229)/4 = 4.602\n      hour21: [3.802, 4.442, 4.300, 3.731] -> (3.802+4.442+4.300+3.731)/4 = 4.06875\n      hour22: [3.660, 6.538, 6.183, 6.645] -> (3.660+6.538+6.183+6.645)/4 = 5.7565\n      hour23: [5.970, 9.132, 9.772, 7.995] -> (5.970+9.132+9.772+7.995)/4 = 8.21725\n\n 28. Now, we create the forecast for the next 96 hours:\n\n      Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 10.51825\n              2016-09-15 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 10.1365\n              ...\n              2016-09-15 23:00:00 -> hour23 -> 8.21725\n\n      Then 2016-09-16 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 10.51825\n            ... and so on until 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We must output the data in the same format: two columns, with the date and the MUFL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 30. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. Rounding the averages:\n\n      hour0: 10.51825 -> 10.518\n      hour1: 10.1365 -> 10.137 (if we round to 3 decimals: 10.1365 is 10.137? \n            Actually: 10.1365 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal (5) -> round up: 10.137)\n\n      But note: the input data does not have trailing zeros beyond 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 33. We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. Alternatively, we can output without rounding? But the input has 3 decimals. We'll round to 3.\n\n 35. Let me recalc with rounding:\n\n      We'll compute the average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 36. Alternatively, we can use the exact value and then format to 3 decimals. But the problem does not specify, but the input has 3.\n\n 37. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 38. Recompute the averages with rounding:\n\n      hour0: 10.51825 -> 10.518\n      hour1: 10.1365 -> 10.137\n      hour2: 10.44725 -> 10.447\n      hour3: 9.52325 -> 9.523\n      hour4: 8.697 -> 8.697\n      hour5: 9.23025 -> 9.230\n      hour6: 10.14525 -> 10.145\n      hour7: 9.461 -> 9.461\n      hour8: 8.74175 -> 8.742\n      hour9: 6.503 -> 6.503\n      hour10: 6.15625 -> 6.156\n      hour11: 6.0055 -> 6.006\n      hour12: 4.58425 -> 4.584\n      hour13: 4.4775 -> 4.478\n      because: 4.4775 -> the 4th decimal is 5, so round up the 3rd decimal: 4.478)\n      hour14: 4.90375 -> 4.904\n      hour15: 4.85075 -> 4.851\n      hour16: 4.362 -> 4.362\n      hour17: 5.01925 -> 5.019\n      hour18: 4.54825 -> 4.548\n      hour19: 4.78825 -> 4.788\n      hour20: 4.602 -> 4.602\n      hour21: 4.06875 -> 4.069\n      hour22: 5.7565 -> 5.757\n      hour23: 8.21725 -> 8.217\n\n 39. Now, we'll generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n      Then add one hour until 96 steps.\n\n 40. We note that the last provided data point is 2016-09-14 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-09-15 00:00:00.\n\n 41. We'll generate the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day1: 2016-09-15: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Day2: 2016-09-16: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Day3: 2016-09-17: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Day4: 2016-09-18: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n\n 42. Now, we write the data:\n\n      For each day, we output the 24 hours with the corresponding average.\n\n 43. Format: \n        <answer>\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 10.518\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00 10.137\n        ... \n\n 44. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 45. Let's code the output:\n\n      We have a list of 24 values (the averages for hour0 to hour23) in order.\n\n      Then we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 46. The list of averages (rounded) for hours 0 to 23:\n\n        hour0: 10.518\n        hour1: 10.137\n        hour2: 10.447\n        hour3: 9.523\n        hour4: 8.697\n        hour5: 9.230\n        hour6: 10.145\n        hour7: 9.461\n        hour8: 8.742\n        hour9: 6.503\n        hour10: 6.156\n        hour11: 6.006\n        hour12: 4.584\n        hour13: 4.478\n        hour14: 4.904\n        hour15: 4.851\n        hour16: 4.362\n        hour17: 5.019\n        hour18: 4.548\n        hour19: 4.788\n        hour20: 4.602\n        hour21: 4.069\n        hour22: 5.757\n        hour23: 8.217\n\n 47. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n      Then 2016-09-15 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-15 23:00:00 -> first 24\n      Then 2016-09-16 00:00:00 ... until 2016-09-16 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      Then 2016-09-17 00:00:00 ... until 2016-09-17 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      Then 2016-09-18 00:00:00 ... until 2016-09-18 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 48.
