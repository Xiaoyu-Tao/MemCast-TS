        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) variable.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we need to generate the timestamps and the forecasted HULL values.\n\n 4. The last timestamp in the data is 2017-01-28 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the data size (only 96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we might consider models like:\n        * ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n        * Exponential Smoothing\n        * Simple models like moving average, but we have to capture seasonality.\n\n    - Observing the data: There seems to be daily seasonality (24 hours). We can see the pattern repeating every day.\n\n    - We can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. However, with only 4 days of data, the seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: average the same hour across the 4 days we have and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    - But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level.\n\n    - Looking at the data: \n        Day1: min=-2.344, max=0.000? (actually we see 0.000 on day2, but day1 max is -0.268? ... actually day1: min=-2.344, max=-0.268? ... but then we see day1: 12:00 is -0.268, 13:00 is -0.536, then 14:00 is -1.407 -> so no positive values. \n        The values are negative. \n\n    - The pattern: \n        Each day: \n          - Night and early morning: more negative (around -2.0)\n          - Daytime: less negative (around -0.5 to -1.5)\n\n    - We can try to compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    - However, note that the data might have a slight trend? Let's see the average per day:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-25): average = ?\n        We can compute quickly: \n          We have 24 values: \n          Let me approximate: \n            -1.808, -2.076, -2.344, -2.277, -2.277, -2.277, -2.210, -2.210, -1.808, -2.076, -1.608, -1.340, -0.268, -0.536, -1.407, -1.206, -1.608, -1.474, -2.277, -1.005, -0.402, -0.402, -0.871, -1.273\n          Sum = ? \n          We can calculate: \n            -1.808 -2.076 = -3.884\n            -3.884 -2.344 = -6.228\n            ... it's tedious, but we can note that the values are mostly between -2.3 and -0.2. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the mean of the entire 96 points? \n\n        But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none.\n\n    - Since we are to forecast 4 days and we have 4 days of history, we can use the average of each hour across the 4 days.\n\n    - Steps for the average method:\n        For hour 0: average of [2017-01-25 00:00:00, 2017-01-26 00:00:00, 2017-01-27 00:00:00, 2017-01-28 00:00:00] = (-1.808 + -1.608 + -1.674 + -1.139) / 4\n        Similarly for hour 1: (-2.076 + -1.875 + -1.942 + -1.608) / 4, and so on.\n\n    - Then we repeat this 4-day hourly pattern for the next 4 days (from 2017-01-29 to 2017-02-01).\n\n 6. Why this method?\n    - It's simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n    - With only 4 days, we don't have a long history to model complex trends or changing seasonality.\n\n 7. However, note that the data might have a slight trend? Let's check the overall daily average:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-25: \n            sum = -1.808 -2.076 -2.344 -2.277 -2.277 -2.277 -2.210 -2.210 -1.808 -2.076 -1.608 -1.340 -0.268 -0.536 -1.407 -1.206 -1.608 -1.474 -2.277 -1.005 -0.402 -0.402 -0.871 -1.273\n            = -40.0 (approx) -> average = -40/24 = -1.6667\n\n        Day2: 2017-01-26:\n            -1.608, -1.875, -1.875, -1.942, -2.009, -2.009, -1.942, -1.741, -1.273, -1.474, -1.407, -0.335, 0.000, 0.067, -0.201, -0.536, -1.407, -1.608, -1.541, -0.938, -0.402, -0.402, -0.938, -1.340\n            = approx: \n            Let me compute: \n            -1.608-1.875-1.875-1.942-2.009-2.009-1.942-1.741-1.273-1.474-1.407-0.335+0+0.067-0.201-0.536-1.407-1.608-1.541-0.938-0.402-0.402-0.938-1.340\n            = -1.608-1.875 = -3.483; -3.483-1.875 = -5.358; ... \n            I get approximately -30.0 -> average = -30/24 = -1.25\n\n        Day3: 2017-01-27:\n            -1.674, -1.942, -2.076, -2.076, -2.076, -2.076, -2.076, -1.875, -1.005, -1.139, -1.340, -1.340, -0.871, -1.072, -1.206, -1.206, -1.273, -1.340, -1.541, -0.335, -0.201, -0.268, -0.402, -0.871\n            = approx: \n            -1.674-1.942-2.076*4 -1.875 -1.005 -1.139 -1.340*2 -0.871 -1.072 -1.206*2 -1.273 -1.340 -1.541 -0.335 -0.201 -0.268 -0.402 -0.871\n            = -1.674-1.942 = -3.616; -3.616-8.304 (for 4 times -2.076) = -11.92; -11.92-1.875 = -13.795; ... \n            I get approximately -30.0 -> average = -1.25\n\n        Day4: 2017-01-28:\n            -1.139, -1.608, -2.009, -1.942, -1.942, -1.942, -1.942, -1.875, -1.474, -1.608, -1.741, -1.541, -0.067, -0.201, -0.402, -1.139, -1.741, -1.808, -2.143, -1.273, -1.072, -1.206, -1.340, -1.674\n            = approx: \n            -1.139-1.608-2.009-1.942*3 -1.875 -1.474 -1.608 -1.741 -1.541 -0.067 -0.201 -0.402 -1.139 -1.741 -1.808 -2.143 -1.273 -1.072 -1.206 -1.340 -1.674\n            = -1.139-1.608 = -2.747; -2.747-2.009 = -4.756; -4.756-5.826 (3 times -1.942) = -10.582; ... \n            I get approximately -35.0 -> average = -35/24 = -1.458\n\n        The daily averages: \n          Day1: -1.6667\n          Day2: -1.25\n          Day3: -1.25\n          Day4: -1.458\n\n        There is a clear drop (less negative) on day2 and day3, then a return to more negative on day4? \n        But we are only with 4 days, so it's hard to say if there's a trend. \n\n    - Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire 96 points and then use the hourly profile (relative to the mean) to forecast.\n\n    - However, for simplicity and because we are only forecasting 4 days, we can use the average per hour over the 4 days.\n\n 8. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days:\n\n        Hour0: ( -1.808, -1.608, -1.674, -1.139 ) -> average = (-1.808 -1.608 -1.674 -1.139)/4 = (-6.229)/4 = -1.55725\n        Hour1: ( -2.076, -1.875, -1.942, -1.608 ) -> (-2.076-1.875-1.942-1.608)/4 = (-7.501)/4 = -1.87525\n        Hour2: ( -2.344, -1.875, -2.076, -2.009 ) -> (-2.344-1.875-2.076-2.009)/4 = (-8.304)/4 = -2.076\n        Hour3: ( -2.277, -1.942, -2.076, -1.942 ) -> (-2.277-1.942-2.076-1.942)/4 = (-8.237)/4 = -2.05925\n        Hour4: ( -2.277, -2.009, -2.076, -1.942 ) -> (-2.277-2.009-2.076-1.942)/4 = (-8.304)/4 = -2.076\n        Hour5: ( -2.277, -2.009, -2.076, -1.942 ) -> (-2.277-2.009-2.076-1.942)/4 = -8.304/4 = -2.076\n        Hour6: ( -2.210, -1.942, -2.076, -1.942 ) -> (-2.210-1.942-2.076-1.942)/4 = (-8.17)/4 = -2.0425\n        Hour7: ( -2.210, -1.741, -1.875, -1.875 ) -> (-2.210-1.741-1.875-1.875)/4 = (-7.701)/4 = -1.92525\n        Hour8: ( -1.808, -1.273, -1.005, -1.474 ) -> (-1.808-1.273-1.005-1.474)/4 = (-5.56)/4 = -1.39\n        Hour9: ( -2.076, -1.474, -1.139, -1.608 ) -> (-2.076-1.474-1.139-1.608)/4 = (-6.297)/4 = -1.57425\n        Hour10: ( -1.608, -1.407, -1.340, -1.741 ) -> (-1.608-1.407-1.340-1.741)/4 = (-6.096)/4 = -1.524\n        Hour11: ( -1.340, -0.335, -1.340, -1.541 ) -> (-1.340-0.335-1.340-1.541)/4 = (-4.556)/4 = -1.139\n        Hour12: ( -0.268, 0.000, -0.871, -0.067 ) -> (-0.268+0-0.871-0.067)/4 = (-1.206)/4 = -0.3015\n        Hour13: ( -0.536, 0.067, -1.072, -0.201 ) -> (-0.536+0.067-1.072-0.201)/4 = (-1.742)/4 = -0.4355\n        Hour14: ( -1.407, -0.201, -1.206, -0.402 ) -> (-1.407-0.201-1.206-0.402)/4 = (-3.216)/4 = -0.804\n        Hour15: ( -1.206, -0.536, -1.206, -1.139 ) -> (-1.206-0.536-1.206-1.139)/4 = (-4.087)/4 = -1.02175\n        Hour16: ( -1.608, -1.407, -1.273, -1.741 ) -> (-1.608-1.407-1.273-1.741)/4 = (-6.029)/4 = -1.50725\n        Hour17: ( -1.474, -1.608, -1.340, -1.808 ) -> (-1.474-1.608-1.340-1.808)/4 = (-6.23)/4 = -1.5575\n        Hour18: ( -2.277, -1.541, -1.541, -2.143 ) -> (-2.277-1.541-1.541-2.143)/4 = (-7.502)/4 = -1.8755\n        Hour19: ( -1.005, -0.938, -0.335, -1.273 ) -> (-1.005-0.938-0.335-1.273)/4 = (-3.551)/4 = -0.88775\n        Hour20: ( -0.402, -0.402, -0.201, -1.072 ) -> (-0.402-0.402-0.201-1.072)/4 = (-2.077)/4 = -0.51925\n        Hour21: ( -0.402, -0.402, -0.268, -1.206 ) -> (-0.402-0.402-0.268-1.206)/4 = (-2.278)/4 = -0.5695\n        Hour22: ( -0.871, -0.938, -0.402, -1.340 ) -> (-0.871-0.938-0.402-1.340)/4 = (-3.551)/4 = -0.88775\n        Hour23: ( -1.273, -1.340, -0.871, -1.674 ) -> (-1.273-1.340-0.871-1.674)/4 = (-5.158)/4 = -1.2895\n\n 9. Now, we will use these 24 hourly averages as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days.\n\n    The next 4 days:\n        Day1: 2017-01-29 (starting at 00:00:00) to 2017-01-29 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-01-30\n        Day3: 2017-01-31\n        Day4: 2017-02-01\n\n    For each day, we assign the 24 values in order.\n\n 10. Format the answer: We must output 96 lines, each line: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <value>\", with the value rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 11. We note: the input data has 3 decimal places, so we round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 12. Let's round the computed average for each hour:\n\n        Hour0: -1.55725 -> -1.557\n        Hour1: -1.87525 -> -1.875\n        Hour2: -2.076 -> -2.076\n        Hour3: -2.05925 -> -2.059\n        Hour4: -2.076 -> -2.076\n        Hour5: -2.076 -> -2.076\n        Hour6: -2.0425 -> -2.043\n        because: 2.0425 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 2.043? but note negative? \n        Actually, we round the absolute value and then put the negative sign? \n        The rule: \n          -2.0425: \n            The digit in the thousandths place is 2, and the next is 5 -> so we round up the thousandths place: 2 becomes 3? \n            So -2.043.\n\n        But let me check: \n          -2.0425 is between -2.042 and -2.043. Since 2.0425 is exactly halfway, we round to the nearest even? \n          However, the common practice is to round half away from zero? \n          But in the input data we have values like -2.277, which is to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places by rounding half to even? But the problem doesn't specify. \n        We'll use the standard rounding: round to the nearest, and if exactly halfway, round to the nearest even.\n\n        However, for simplicity, we see that the input data does not have such halfway cases? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            value = round(avg, 3)\n\n        In Python, rounding -2.0425: \n            >>> round(-2.0425, 3)\n            -2.042   # because 2.0425 is exactly halfway? Actually, no: 2.0425 is 20425/10000 = 4085/2000, but in binary? \n            But the rounding rule in Python for floats: round half to even.\n\n        However, we are to match the input format. The input has: -1.344, -2.076, etc.\n\n        We'll compute:\n\n        Hour0: -1.55725 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            The 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5 -> so -1.557\n        Hour1: -1.87525 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> -1.875\n        Hour2: -2.076 -> exactly -2.076\n        Hour3: -2.05925 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> -2.059\n        Hour4: -2.076 -> -2.076\n        Hour5: -2.076 -> -2.076\n        Hour6: -2.0425 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> and the 3rd decimal is 2 (even) -> so we leave it as -2.042? \n            But wait: the rule: round half to even: \n                The number is -2.0425. The digit in the 3rd decimal is 2, and the next is 5. We look at the digit to round: 2 is even, so we leave it? \n                So -2.042? \n            However, note: 2.0425 rounded to 3 decimals: \n                The number is 2.0425. The 3rd decimal is 2 and the next is 5 -> we round to the even: 2.042 -> but wait, 2.0425 is exactly halfway between 2.042 and 2.043. \n                The rule: round to the nearest even -> 2.042 is even? The digit in the thousandths place is 2 (even) and 2.043 has 3 (odd). So we choose 2.042? \n                But then negative: -2.042.\n\n            However, let me check with an example: \n                >>> round(2.0425, 3)\n                2.042\n                >>> round(2.0435, 3)\n                2.044   # because 3 is odd, so we round up to 4.\n\n            So for -2.0425: \n                >>> round(-2.0425, 3)\n                -2.042\n\n        But note: the input data has -2.210, -2.277, etc. So we'll do the same.\n\n        So:\n          Hour6: -2.0425 -> -2.042\n\n        Hour7: -1.92525 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> -1.925\n        Hour8: -1.39 -> but wait, we computed -1.39? Actually we had -1.56/4? \n                Actually: -5.56/4 = -1.39 -> but we need 3 decimals: -1.390\n        Hour9: -1.57425 -> -1.574\n        Hour10: -1.524 -> -1.524\n        Hour11: -1.139 -> -1.139\n        But wait: we computed -1.139? Actually: -4.556/4 = -1.139 -> so -1.139\n        Hour12: -0.3015 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> and the 3rd decimal is 1 (odd) -> so we round up: -0.302\n        Hour13: -0.4355 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> and the 3rd decimal is 5? \n                Actually: -0.4355: the 3rd decimal is 5, and the next is 5 -> so we round the 5: \n                The digit in the thousandths place is 5, and the next is 5 -> we round up? \n                But the rule: round half to even: \n                    The number is 0.4355 -> the thousandths place is 5, and the next is 5 -> we look at the hundredths: 3 (odd) -> so we round up the thousandths? \n                Actually, we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n                    The number is -0.4355. \n                    The 3rd decimal is 5, and the 4th is 5 -> we look at the 5 in the thousandths: we are to 3 decimals, so we look at the 4th decimal (which is 5) and beyond? \n                Actually, the rule: we look at the first digit to be dropped (the 4th decimal) which is 5, then we round the last kept digit (the 3rd) up by one? \n                But the standard rule in Python for round: \n                    >>> round(-0.4355, 3)\n                    -0.436   # because 0.4355 is closer to 0.436 than to 0.435? \n                However, note: 0.4355 is exactly halfway between 0.435 and 0.436? \n                Actually, 0.4355 is 4355/10000 = 871/2000. \n                The rule: round half to even: \n                    The two options: 0.435 and 0.436. The even one? \n                    0.435: the last digit 5 is odd? -> but we are rounding to 3rd decimal: \n                    The number 0.4355: \n                        The digit in the 3rd decimal is 5, and we are to round to the nearest even in the 3rd decimal? \n                    Actually, the rule applies to the digit we are rounding: \n                        We are rounding to 3rd decimal: so we look at the 4th decimal. \n                        Since it's 5, we then look at the 3rd decimal: 5 is odd -> so we round up to 6? \n                    Therefore: 0.436 -> so -0.436.\n\n        So Hour13: -0.436\n\n        Hour14: -0.804 -> -0.804\n        Hour15: -1.02175 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> so round up: -1.022\n        But wait: -1.02175: \n            The 4th decimal is 7 -> which is >5 -> so we round the 1 (in the 3rd decimal) up: \n            -1.022\n\n        Hour16: -1.50725 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> -1.507\n        Hour17: -1.5575 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> and the 3rd decimal is 7 (odd) -> so we round up: -1.558\n        Hour18: -1.8755 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> and the 3rd decimal is 5 (odd) -> so we round up: -1.876\n        Hour19: -0.88775 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> -0.888\n        Hour20: -0.51925 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> -0.519\n        Hour21: -0.5695 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> and the 3rd decimal is 9 (odd) -> so we round up: but 9 becomes 10 -> so -0.570\n        Hour22: -0.88775 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> -0.888\n        Hour23: -1.2895 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> and the 3rd decimal is 9 (odd) -> so we round up: -1.290\n\n    However, note: for Hour21: \n        -0.5695 -> \n            The 3rd decimal is 9, and we round up: 9+1=10 -> so we set 9 to 0 and carry over: \n            -0.570\n\n    But let me do it step by step: \n        -0.5695: \n            We are rounding to 3 decimals: \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> so we add 0.001 to the absolute value? \n            But note: \n                -0.5695 is negative. \n            The rounding: \n                The current number: -0.5695\n                We want to round to 3 decimals: \n                The digit in the 3rd decimal is 9, and we are rounding up: 9+1=10 -> so we set that digit to 0 and add 1 to the next (hundredths) -> 6 becomes 7? \n                So: -0.570\n\n    So we have:\n\n        Hour0: -1.557\n        Hour1: -1.875\n        Hour2: -2.076\n        Hour3: -2.059\n        Hour4: -2.076\n        Hour5: -2.076\n        Hour6: -2.042\n        Hour7: -1.925\n        Hour8: -1.390\n        Hour9: -1.574\n        Hour10: -1.524\n        Hour11: -1.139\n        Hour12: -0.302\n        Hour13: -0.436\n        Hour14: -0.804\n        Hour15: -1.022\n        Hour16: -1.507\n        Hour17: -1.558\n        Hour18: -1.876\n        Hour19: -0.888\n        Hour20: -0.519\n        Hour21: -0.570\n        Hour22: -0.888\n        Hour23: -1.290\n\n 13. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-29 00:00:00 -> Hour0: -1.557\n        Then 2017-01-29 01:00:00 -> Hour1: -1.875\n        ... until 2017-01-29 23:00:00 -> Hour23: -1.290\n\n        Then 2017-01-30 00:00:00 -> Hour0: -1.557\n        ... and so on until 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n\n 14. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 15. Note: We are to output exactly 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n        from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00\n\n        We can use:\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        start = '2017-01-29 00:00:00'\n        end = '2017-02-01 23:00:00'\n        date_range = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq='H')\n\n        But we are not have pandas? We can do manually:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-29: 24 hours\n        Day2: 2017-01-30: 24 hours\n        Day3: 2017-01-31: 24 hours\n        Day4: 2017-02-01: 24 hours\n\n        Total 96.\n\n        We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        for day in [29, 30, 31, 1]:\n            but note: January has 31 days, so 29,30,31 are January, then February 1.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        days = [\n            '2017-01-29', '2017-01-30', '2017-01-31', '2017-02-01'\n        ]\n\n        Then for each day, for hour in range(0,24):\n\n        Format the hour: \n            hour_str = f\"{hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n        Then the date string: f\"{day} {hour_str}\"\n\n 16. But note: the last day of January is 31, then next day is February 1.\n\n 17. We assign the hourly pattern for each day.\n\n Implementation:\n\n        hourly_pattern = [\n            -1.557, -1.875, -2.076, -2.059, -2.076, -2.076, -2.042, -1.925, \n            -1.390, -1.574, -1.524, -1.139, -0.302, -0.436, -0.804, -1.022,\n            -1.507, -1.558, -1.876, -0.888, -0.519, -0.570, -0.888, -1.290\n        ]\n\n        Then for each day in the 4 days, we output the 24 values in order.\n\n 18. Write the answer in the required format.\n\n 19. Note: We must not omit any content.\n\n Let's write the data.\n",
