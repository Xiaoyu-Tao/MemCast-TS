        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-10-13 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 hours, but we are to be cautious.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing.\n    So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data (96 hours) and we are to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours),\n    we can consider a time series model that captures daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 4. We note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (temperature rises during the day and falls at night).\n\n 5. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) to forecast the next 96 points. This is a very short history.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a model with:\n    - Daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n    - We might use a simple seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the day by the same hour of the previous day.\n      But that would be just repeating the last day (2016-10-16) for the next 4 days? But we have 4 days of history.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the available 4 days? But 4 days is very short.\n\n 9. However, the problem does not specify the method. We are an expert, so we choose a robust method.\n\n 10. Given the short history, we can use a model that uses trend and seasonality. We can use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing\n     with additive seasonality and a trend component. But note: the data might have a changing pattern.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simple linear regression with dummy variables for hours? But 4 days is too short for that.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast, we can use a model that automatically handles\n     seasonality and trend. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels.\n\n 13. However, note: the data might have missing values in the future? But the problem says we must provide the next 96 dates without omission.\n\n 14. We will:\n     - Use the last 96 points to fit an Exponential Smoothing model with additive trend and additive seasonality of period 24.\n     - Then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 15. But note: the data of 4 days might not be enough to fit a model with 24 seasonal parameters? We have 4 cycles, which is minimal.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a moving average method to capture the daily pattern and then adjust for the last level.\n\n 17. Since the problem is challenging with only 4 days, we might also consider a naive seasonal forecast: \n     We take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n     But we don't know if there's a trend.\n\n 18. Looking at the data: \n     Day 1 (2016-10-13): min ~14.984, max ~17.938\n     Day 2 (2016-10-14): min ~14.491, max ~16.883\n     Day 3 (2016-10-15): min ~15.476, max ~21.245\n     Day 4 (2016-10-16): min ~18.853, max ~22.3\n\n     There is an increasing trend? But then again, it's only 4 days.\n\n 19. We can try to fit a linear trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 20. Given the time and the requirement to provide an answer, we decide to use a simple method: \n     We will use the last day (2016-10-16) as the base and then adjust by the overall trend observed in the 4 days.\n\n 21. Steps for the trend: \n     Let's compute the average of each day:\n        Day1: average of 2016-10-13\n        Day2: average of 2016-10-14\n        Day3: average of 2016-10-15\n        Day4: average of 2016-10-16\n\n     Then compute the linear trend over these 4 points? Then project the next 4 days.\n\n 22. But note: we are forecasting 96 hours, so we need hourly pattern.\n\n 23. We can do:\n     - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal and residual.\n     - Extrapolate the trend linearly (or with a simple method) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 24. However, with only 4 days, we can compute the daily average and then the daily pattern (seasonal indices).\n\n 25. Let:\n        daily_avg = [ avg_day1, avg_day2, avg_day3, avg_day4 ]\n\n     Then we fit a linear regression on daily_avg vs. day index (0,1,2,3) to get a slope and intercept).\n\n     Then for the next 4 days (day indices 4,5,6,7), we compute the daily average.\n\n     Then for each hour in a day, we compute the seasonal index as the average of (hour_value - daily_avg) for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n     Then the forecast for hour h in day d (d=4,5,6,7) is:\n         forecast = (intercept + slope * d) + seasonal_index[h]\n\n 26. But note: the daily_avg for day1 (2016-10-13) is computed from 24 hours, similarly for others.\n\n 27. Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n     Day1 (2016-10-13): \n        average =

496.016 / 24 = 20.6673333333\n\n     Now, the daily averages: \n        day0: 16.9184 (2016-10-13)\n        day1: 15.4059 (2016-10-14)\n        day2: 17.8446 (2016-10-15)\n        day3: 20.6673 (2016-10-16)\n\n     We see an increasing trend? But it went down on day1 then up.\n\n     Let's fit a linear trend to these 4 points? We can use:\n\n        y = a + b * x\n\n        where x = [0,1,2,3] for the four days.\n\n        We can compute:\n\n        n = 4\n        sum_x = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n        sum_y = 16.9184+15.4059+17.8446+20.6673 = 70.8362\n        sum_xy = 0*16.9184 + 1*15.4059 + 2*17.8446 + 3*20.6673 = 0 + 15.4059 + 35.6892 + 62.0019 = 113.097\n        sum_x2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n        b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n          = (4*113.097 - 6*70.8362) / (4*14 - 36)\n          = (452.388 - 425.0172) / (56 - 36)\n          = 27.3708 / 20 = 1.36854\n\n        a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (70.8362 - 1.36854*6) / 4 = (70.8362 - 8.21124) / 4 = 62.62496 / 4 = 15.65624\n\n        So the trend line:\n            y = 15.65624 + 1.36854 * x\n\n        For the next 4 days (x=4,5,6,7):\n\n            day4 (x=4): 15.65624 + 1.36854*4 = 15.65624+5.47416 = 21.1304\n            day5 (x=5): 15.65624+1.36854*5 = 15.65624+6.8427 = 22.49894\n            day6 (x=6): 15.65624+1.36854*6 = 15.65624+8.21124 = 23.86748\n            day7 (x=7): 15.65624+1.36854*7 = 15.65624+9.57978 = 25.23602\n\n     But note: the trend is increasing, but we have only 4 points and the last day was 20.6673 and we are projecting 21.13 for the next day? \n        That seems reasonable.\n\n 28. Now, we compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the deviation from the daily average for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n     For hour i (0<=i<=23):\n        index_i = ( (value_i_day0 - avg_day0) + (value_i_day1 - avg_day1) + (value_i_day2 - avg_day2) + (value_i_day3 - avg_day3) ) / 4\n\n     Then for a future day d (d=4,5,6,7) and hour i, the forecast is:\n        forecast = (trend for day d) + index_i\n\n 29. But note: we have 4 days, so we can compute the seasonal component for each hour.\n\n 30. Let's compute the seasonal indices:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and accumulate the deviation.\n\n     Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n\n        day0: 17.938 - 16.9184 = 1.0196\n        day1: 15.476 - 15.4059 = 0.0701\n        day2: 15.687 - 17.8446 = -2.1576\n        day3: 20.823 - 20.6673 = 0.1557\n\n        index0 = (1.0196+0.0701-2.1576+0.1557)/4 = (-0.9122)/4 = -0.22805\n\n     Similarly, we do for all hours.\n\n 31. However, note: the seasonal indices should sum to zero over a full cycle? But we are using additive model.\n\n     We can adjust by ensuring the average of the 24 indices is zero? But we are using the average of 4 days, it might not be zero.\n\n     We can normalize: subtract the mean of the indices from each index to make the average zero? \n        But the model does not strictly require that? Actually, the trend already captures the level.\n\n     Alternatively, we can leave as is.\n\n 32. We'll compute the 24 indices without normalization.\n\n 33. We'll do for all 24 hours.\n\n 34. Then we forecast:\n\n        For day4 (2016-10-17, x=4): trend = 21.1304\n        For hour0: 21.1304 + index0 = 21.1304 - 0.22805 = 20.90235\n\n        Similarly, for hour1, ... hour23.\n\n        Then day5 (2016-10-18, x=5): trend = 22.49894, then add the same indices for each hour.\n\n        And so on.\n\n 35. But note: the indices are computed from the 4 days, and we use the same indices for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 36. We must generate 96 data points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n 37. We must be cautious: the indices might be noisy because we only 4 days.\n\n 38. Let's compute the indices:\n\n     We have the data:\n\n        Day0: [17.938, 17.516, 17.727, 17.376, 15.125]  -> 24 values\n        Day1: [15.476, 15.828, ... , 15.758]\n        Day2: [15.687, 15.476, ... , 21.245]\n        Day3: [20.823, 20.682, ... , 20.119]\n\n     And the daily averages: [16.9184, 15.4059, 17.8446, 20.6673]\n\n     We'll compute for each hour i from 0 to 23:\n\n        index[i] = ( (day0[i] - 16.9184) + (day1[i] - 15.4059) + (day2[i] - 17.8446) + (day3[i] - 20.6673) ) / 4\n\n 39. We do this for each hour.\n\n 40. Then we generate the next 96 points:\n\n        The next 4 days: \n          day4: 2016-10-17, day5: 2016-10-18, day6: 2016-10-19, day7: 2016-10-20\n\n        For d in [4,5,6,7]:\n            trend_d = 15.65624 + 1.36854 * d\n            for hour in range(24):\n                value = trend_d + index[hour]\n\n 41. We then output the 96 points with the corresponding datetime.\n\n 42. We must format the dates: \n        The last date in the given data is 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n        The next date: 2016-10-17 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n\n 43. We'll generate the datetime strings.\n\n 44. However, note: the data provided has 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 45. Let's compute the indices:\n\n     We'll create a list for the 24 hours.\n\n     We have the data in the order of the 96 points. The first 24 are day0, next 24 day1, then day2, then day3.\n\n     We can index:\n\n        day0: indices 0 to 23\n        day1: 24 to 47\n        day2: 48 to 71\n        day3: 72 to 95\n\n     But we have the data as a list? We can use the provided data.\n\n 46. Alternatively, we can use the values we already extracted for each day.\n\n     We have:\n\n        day0_values = [17.938, 17.516, 17.727, 17.376, 16.883, 17.165, 17.235, 17.446, 17.376, 17.094, 17.376, 17.235, 17.657, 17.516, 17.446, 17.235, 17.165, 17.094, 16.532, 16.461, 14.984, 15.406, 15.054, 15.125]\n\n        day1_values = [15.476, 15.828, 15.898, 15.758, 14.914, 14.843, 15.617, 16.039, 15.195, 15.828, 15.406, 14.491, 15.476, 14.773, 15.195, 14.491, 14.843, 15.054, 15.476, 15.547, 15.758, 16.109, 15.969, 15.758]\n\n        day2_values = [15.687, 15.476, 15.828, 15.758, 15.898, 15.898, 15.898, 16.109, 16.672, 16.883, 17.587, 17.446, 18.431, 19.064, 19.064, 18.853, 19.205, 19.627, 19.275, 19.064, 19.205, 19.627, 20.471, 21.245]\n\n        day3_values = [20.823, 20.682, 22.019, 21.737, 18.853, 18.572, 19.345, 19.556, 20.541, 19.768, 21.245, 21.385, 21.878, 22.3, 22.019, 21.034, 21.808, 21.174, 21.385, 20.752, 19.486, 18.853, 20.682, 20.119]\n\n     And the daily averages: \n        avg0 = 16.9184\n        avg1 = 15.4059\n        avg2 = 17.8446\n        avg3 = 20.6673\n\n     Now, for hour0 (index0 in the day):\n\n        index0 = (day0_values[0] - avg0) + (day1_values[0] - avg1) + (day2_values[0] - avg2) + (day3_values[0] - avg3)\n                = (17.938 - 16.9184) + (15.476 - 15.4059) + (15.687 - 17.8446) + (20.823 - 20.6673)\n                = (1.0196) + (0.0701) + (-2.1576) + (0.1557) = -0.9122\n        index0 = -0.9122 / 4 = -0.22805\n\n     Similarly for hour1:\n\n        (17.516 - 16.9184) = 0.5976\n        (15.828 - 15.4059) = 0.4221\n        (15.476 - 17.8446) = -2.3686\n        (20.682 - 20.6673) = 0.0147\n        sum = 0.5976+0.4221-2.3686+0.0147 = -1.3342\n        index1 = -1.3342/4 = -0.33355\n\n     We do for all 24.\n\n 47. We'll compute the 24 indices.\n\n 48. Then we compute the trend for the next 4 days:\n\n        day4 (x=4): 15.65624 + 1.36854*4 = 21.1304\n        day5 (x=5): 15.65624 + 1.36854*5 = 22.49894\n        day6 (x=6): 15.65624 + 1.36854*6 = 23.86748\n        day7 (x=7): 15.65624 + 1.36854*7 = 25.23602\n\n 49. Then for each day d in [4,5,6,7] and hour h in [0,23]:\n\n        value = trend_d + index_h\n\n 50. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 51. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-17 00:00:00, then 2016-10-17 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n\n 52. We output in the same format: two columns: date and OT.\n\n 53. We must be cautious: the indices might be negative? Yes, but that's okay.\n\n 54.

Now, we have the 24 indices.\n\n 56. Then we compute the next 4 days:\n\n        Day4 (2016-10-17): trend = 21.1304\n        Day5: 22.49894\n        Day6: 23.86748\n        Day7: 25.23602\n\n        For hour0 to hour23 in day4:\n            value = 21.1304 + index_h\n\n        For day5: value = 22.49894 + index_h\n\n        etc.\n\n 57. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-17 00:00:00 -> hour0 of day4\n        Then 2016-10-17 01:00:00 -> hour1 of day4\n        ...\n        2016-10-17 23:00:00 -> hour23 of day4\n        Then 2016-10-18 00:00:00 -> hour0 of day5\n        ... until 2016-10-20 23:00:00 -> hour23 of day7\n\n 58. We output 96 lines.\n\n 59. We round the OT to 3 decimal places.\n\n 60. Let's do an example for the first few:\n\n        Day4, hour0: 21.1304 - 0.22805 = 20.90235 -> 20.902\n        Day4, hour1: 21.1304 - 0.33355 = 20.79685 -> 20.797\n        Day4, hour2: 21.1304 + 0.15895 = 21.28935 -> 21.289\n        ...\n\n 61. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 62. Note: The problem says the data may have missing values, but we are forecasting without missing? \n        We are providing the forecast for the next 96 points without missing.\n\n 63. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-10-17 00:00:00 20.902\n        2016-10-17 01:00:00 20.797\n        ... \n\n 64. We do for all 96.\n\n 65. We must be cautious: the indices we computed might be off due to rounding? But we used the values as given.\n\n 66. We'll generate the entire 96.\n\n 67. We note: the method is simple and based on linear trend and additive seasonality.\n\n 68. Due to the short history, the forecast might not be very accurate, but it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 69. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 70. Let's code the 96 points:\n\n        days = [4,5,6,7] -> representing the day index for the next 4 days.\n\n        trend for day d: 15.65624 + 1.36854 * d\n\n        for d in [4,5,6,7]:\n            base_trend = 15.65624 + 1.36854 * d\n            for h in range(24):\n                value = base_trend + index_list[h]\n                # round to 3 decimals\n                value = round(value, 3)\n\n        and the date: \n            start_date = datetime(2016,10,17) for day4 -> 2016-10-17\n            then add d-4 days? Actually, d=4 -> 2016-10-17, d=5 -> 2016-10-18, etc.\n\n        We can do: \n            base_date = datetime(2016,10,17)\n            for i in range(96):\n                day_offset = i // 24   # 0,1,2,3 -> then date = base_date + timedelta(days=day_offset)\n                hour = i % 24\n                d_index = 4 + day_offset   # the day index in the trend (4,5,6,7)\n                base_trend = 15.65624 + 1.36854 * d_index\n                value = base_trend + index_list[hour]\n                value = round(value, 3)\n\n 71. We'll generate the index_list as:\n\n        index_list = [\n            -0.22805, -0.33355, 0.15895, -0.0518, -1.07205, -1.08955, -0.6853, -0.42155, \n            -0.26305, -0.3158, 0.19445, -0.0698, 0.65145, 0.7042, 0.72195, 0.1942, 0.5462, 0.5282, 0.45795, 0.24695, -0.3508, -0.2103, 0.33495, 0.3527\n        ]\n\n 72. But note: we computed the indices with more precision, so we use the full precision in the calculation.\n\n 73. We'll use the indices as computed above without rounding until the final value.\n\n 74. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 75. We must be cautious: the indices we computed might have rounding errors? We did the calculation with the given numbers.\n\n 76. We output the answer in the required format.\n\n 77. Due to the length, we'll generate the data and then format it.\n\n 78. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-10-17 00:00:00 <value1>\n        2016-10-17 01:00:00 <value2>\n        ...\n        2016-10-20 23:00:00 <value96>\n        </answer>\n\n 79. We'll compute the values.\n\n 80. Let's do the first few:\n\n        i=0: day_offset=0, d_index=4, base_trend = 15.65624 + 1.36854*4 = 15.65624+5.47416=21.1304\n             hour0: 21.1304 + (-0.22805) = 20.90235 -> 20.902\n        i=1: hour1: 21.1304 + (-0.33355) = 20.79685 -> 20.797\n        i=2: 21.1304+0.15895=21.28935 -> 21.289\n        i=3: 21.1304-0.0518=21.0786 -> 21.079\n        i=4: 21.1304-1.07205=20.05835 -> 20.058\n        i=5: 21.1304-1.08955=20.04085 -> 20.041\n        i=6: 21.1304-0.6853=20.4451 -> 20.445\n        i=7: 21.1304-0.42155=20.70885 -> 20.709\n        i=8: 21.1304-0.26305=20.86735 -> 20.867\n        i=9: 21.1304-0.3158=20.8146 -> 20.815\n        i=10: 21.1304+0.19445=21.32485 -> 21.325\n        i=11: 21.1304-0.0698=21.0606 -> 21.061\n        i=12: 21.1304+0.65145=21.78185 -> 21.782\n        i=23: 21.1304+0.3527=21.4831 -> 21.483\n\n        Then next day (2016-10-18, day5, d_index=5):\n            base_trend = 15.65624+1.36854*5 = 15.65624+6.8427=22.49894\n            hour0: 22.49894 -0.22805 = 22.27089 -> 22.271\n            ...\n\n 81. We'll generate the entire list.\n\n 82. We note: we are using the indices as computed.\n\n 83. We output the data.\n\n 84. Due to the length, we'll generate in code and then output.\n\n 85. We are not writing code, but we'll do the first day and then the rest similarly.\n\n 86. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 87.
