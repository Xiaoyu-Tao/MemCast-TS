        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly patterns (though we only have 4 days).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points does not have any missing values in the given sample.\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are limited to the provided 96 points and the requirement is to forecast 96 points, we can use a time series model that can capture seasonality.\n\n Given the hourly data and the seasonality of 24, we can use a seasonal naive method, or more sophisticated models like SARIMA or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data is only 4 days, which is very short for training a complex model. We might consider:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal Naive\n   - Forecast each hour of the same hour in the previous day. But we have only 4 days, so we can take the last day (day 4) and repeat it? \n     But that would be too simplistic and might not capture the trend.\n\n Option 2: Use an average of the same hour over the available days?\n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that is not exactly repeating. Also, we see a trend? Let's check:\n\n We can also consider using a simple moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are to produce? Actually, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". \n But note: the past data we are given does not missing? And we are to forecast the next 96. The instruction might be that the entire dataset (which we are not given beyond the 96) has missing values? \n But we are only given 96 points without missing. So for forecasting, we assume the past is complete.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and we have only 96 points (4 days) of history, we can use:\n\n   - A model: SARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0,24) -> which is equivalent to seasonal random walk: \n        y_{t} = y_{t-24} + e_t\n     Then the forecast for the next 24 hours would be the last day (day 4) and then the next 24 would be the same as the previous 24 hours before? \n     But we are forecasting 96 hours (4 days). So we can do:\n\n        Day 5: same as Day 4\n        Day 6: same as Day 5? but that would be same as Day 4? \n\n     Actually, the seasonal naive forecast for h steps ahead is:\n        y_{T+h} = y_{T+h-24*k}   where k is chosen so that h-24*k is in [1,24] (if we have one season of 24)\n\n     For h=1 to 24: we use the last day (day4: 2017-06-25) for the same hour.\n     For h=25 to 48: we use the day4 again? because we don't have day5? \n\n     But that would be repeating the same day. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n\n Option 3: Average by hour\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days.\n\n   However, note: the data starts at 2017-06-22 (Thursday) and ends at 2017-06-25 (Sunday). The next 4 days would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? \n        from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 to 2017-06-29 23:00:00.\n\n   We don't have data for Monday? So we have only one Sunday? So we can average the same hour over the 4 days? But the pattern might change by day of week.\n\n   Given the limited data, we can do:\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average = (value from day1 + day2 + day3 + day4) / 4.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be:\n\n        Day1 (Monday): use the average of the same hour from the 4 days? \n        But note: the 4 days we have are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Monday might be different.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last week same day? but we don't have last Monday? \n\n   Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n        We use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n   Why? Because we don't have a full week to capture weekly seasonality, and 4 days is too short to model weekly.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Group the data by hour (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n        Step 2: Repeat this average pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n   But note: the data shows a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n        The last value is -0.640 (at 2017-06-25 23:00:00). The average might be around that? \n\n   However, we are to forecast 4 days, and if there is a trend we might need to adjust? But with 4 days, it's hard to see a long-term trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 24 hours (the last day) and then adjust by the overall average? \n\n   But the problem: we must provide the next 96 points.\n\n   Considering simplicity and the data at hand, I choose the average by hour over the 4 days.\n\n   How to compute:\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n        For hour 0: \n           2017-06-22 00:00:00 -> -0.670\n           2017-06-23 00:00:00 -> -0.944\n           2017-06-24 00:00:00 -> -0.944\n           2017-06-25 00:00:00 -> -0.701\n           average = (-0.670 -0.944 -0.944 -0.701) /4 = -0.81475\n\n        Similarly for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n\n        2017-06-26 00:00:00: hour0 -> -0.81475\n        2017-06-26 01:00:00: hour1 -> average of the four days at hour1\n        ... until 2017-06-29 23:00:00.\n\n   But note: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n   The last date in the given data is 2017-06-25 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-26 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-06-29 23:00:00   (because 96 hours = 4 days)\n\n   We'll generate the dates and then assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   However, note: the data we are given has negative values and the average might smooth out the pattern? \n\n   Let's try and see if the average pattern is reasonable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   Since the instruction says \"be aware of missing values\", but we are forecasting and the past data is complete, we don't have missing in the training. \n   And we are to produce the next 96 without missing? So we must provide 96 values.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list of 24 values, each being the average of the 4 days at that hour.\n\n   Code for computation (pseudocode):\n\n        hours = [0,1,...,23]\n        avg_hour = [0]*24\n        for h in range(24):\n            indices = [h, h+24, h+48, h+72]   # because 4 days, 24 hours per day\n            values = [data[i] for i in indices]\n            avg_hour[h] = sum(values) / 4.0\n\n   Then for the next 96 hours:\n\n        day1: 2017-06-26, hours 0 to 23 -> use avg_hour[0] to avg_hour[23]\n        day2: 2017-06-27, hours 0 to 23 -> same avg_hour[0] to avg_hour[23]\n        day3: 2017-06-28, same\n        day4: 2017-06-29, same\n\n   So we are repeating the same daily average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   This is a simple and reasonable approach given the data.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        Hour 0: (-0.670 -0.944 -0.944 -0.701) / 4 = (-3.259) /4 = -0.81475\n        Hour 1: (-0.701 -0.701 -0.761 -0.975) /4 = (-3.138)/4 = -0.7845\n        Hour 2: (-0.701 -0.761 -0.822 -0.883) /4 = (-3.167)/4 = -0.79175\n        Hour 3: (-0.701 -0.761 -0.731 -0.731) /4 = (-2.924)/4 = -0.731\n        Hour 4: (-0.701 -0.701 -0.670 -0.670) /4 = (-2.742)/4 = -0.6855\n        Hour 5: (-0.426 -0.822 -0.670 -0.701) /4 = (-2.619)/4 = -0.65475\n        Hour 6: (-0.426 -0.670 -0.487 -0.548) /4 = (-2.131)/4 = -0.53275\n        Hour 7: (-0.213 -0.609 -0.548 -0.518) /4 = (-1.888)/4 = -0.472\n        Hour 8: (-0.152 -0.487 -0.244 -0.305) /4 = (-1.188)/4 = -0.297\n        Hour 9: (-0.213 -0.731 -0.335 -0.426) /4 = (-1.705)/4 = -0.42625\n        Hour10: (-0.244 -0.731 -0.305 -0.548) /4 = (-1.828)/4 = -0.457\n        Hour11: (-0.396 -0.853 -0.548 -0.396) /4 = (-2.193)/4 = -0.54825\n        Hour12: (-0.457 -0.853 -0.487 -0.457) /4 = (-2.254)/4 = -0.5635\n        Hour13: (-0.244 -0.701 -0.518 -0.487) /4 = (-1.95)/4 = -0.4875\n        Hour14: (-0.305 -0.670 -0.426 -0.457) /4 = (-1.858)/4 = -0.4645\n        Hour15: (-0.518 -0.518 -0.487 -0.396) /4 = (-1.919)/4 = -0.47975\n        Hour16: (-0.457 -0.548 -0.457 -0.548) /4 = (-2.01)/4 = -0.5025\n        Hour17: (-0.487 -0.883 -0.396 -0.518) /4 = (-2.284)/4 = -0.571\n        Hour18: (-0.670 -0.822 -0.579 -0.305) /4 = (-2.376)/4 = -0.594\n        Hour19: (-0.701 -0.944 -0.640 -0.640) /4 = (-2.925)/4 = -0.73125\n        Hour20: (-0.853 -0.822 -0.548 -0.609) /4 = (-2.832)/4 = -0.708\n        Hour21: (-0.761 -0.883 -0.609 -0.670) /4 = (-2.923)/4 = -0.73075\n        Hour22: (-0.761 -0.975 -0.609 -0.579) /4 = (-2.924)/4 = -0.731\n        Hour23: (-0.944 -0.731 -0.609 -0.640) /4 = (-2.924)/4 = -0.731\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 to 2017-06-29 23:00:00) is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-06-26): \n            00:00:00 -> -0.81475\n            01:00:00 -> -0.7845\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> -0.731\n\n        Day2 (2017-06-27): same as Day1? \n            But note: we are using the same average pattern for each day.\n\n        So we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are to provide the complete data. So we are not missing any.\n\n   We must output the data in the same format: two columns: date and LULL.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-26 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-06-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-26 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Then 2017-06-27 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-06-28 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-06-29 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n   Total 96.\n\n   We output:\n\n        date, LULL\n\n   We'll round the LULL to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n   So let's round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Example:\n\n        Hour0: -0.81475 -> -0.815\n        But note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3.\n\n   Alternatively, we can keep as is? But the example output had 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me recalc with rounding:\n\n        Hour0: -0.81475 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            -0.81475: the fourth decimal is 7, so round up: -0.815\n\n        Hour1: -0.7845 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            -0.7845 -> the fourth decimal is 5, so round up: -0.785? \n            But note: negative number, rounding: \n            Actually, rounding -0.7845: \n                The absolute value is 0.7845, rounding to 3 decimals: 0.785 -> so -0.785.\n\n        However, let's do it consistently: we can use the rounding rule: round half to even? \n        But the problem doesn't specify. We'll use standard rounding (round half away from zero).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the exact value and then format to 3 decimals. But for simplicity, we round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Let me recalc each hour with rounding:\n\n        Hour0: (-0.670 -0.944 -0.944 -0.701) = -3.259 -> -3.259/4 = -0.81475 -> round to 3 decimals: -0.815\n        Hour1: (-0.701 -0.701 -0.761 -0.975) = -3.138 -> -0.7845 -> -0.785\n        because 0.7845 rounded to 3 decimals: 0.785 -> so -0.785\n\n        But let me check: \n            -0.7845: \n                The digit in the 4th decimal is 5, so we round the third decimal (4) up to 5? \n                So -0.785.\n\n        Hour2: (-0.701 -0.761 -0.822 -0.883) = -3.167 -> -0.79175 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            -0.79175: 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 0.792 -> so -0.792\n\n        Actually, -0.79175: \n            The third decimal is 1, the fourth is 7 -> so we round the 1 up to 2? \n            But wait: \n                -0.79175: \n                The number is negative, but rounding: \n                We look at the absolute value: 0.79175 -> rounding to 3 decimals: 0.792 -> so -0.792.\n\n        We'll do that for all.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        value = round(avg, 3)\n\n   in Python.\n\n   But we are doing by hand? Let me compute:\n\n        Hour0: -0.81475 -> -0.815\n        Hour1: -0.7845 -> -0.7845 is exactly halfway?
