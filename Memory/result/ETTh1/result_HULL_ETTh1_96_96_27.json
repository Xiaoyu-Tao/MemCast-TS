        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missingness in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are consecutive and without gaps. So for the next 96, we must be prepared to handle potential missingness in the input? \n    the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete. So we assume that the forecasting must be robust to missingness, but the given input is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we need to generate the timestamps and the forecasted HULL values.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the small data size (96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we might use models like:\n        * ARIMA (or SARIMA) to capture potential seasonality. Since we have hourly data, we might expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not present.\n        * Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) if we can assume seasonality.\n        * Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality if the pattern is not clear.\n\n    - However, note that the data shows:\n        * A daily pattern: the values drop during the day (around 9:00 to 18:00) and rise at night? But the pattern is not very clear and there are negative values.\n\n    - Let's try to decompose the series to see if there is seasonality. But with only 4 days, it's challenging.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model (like LSTM) but 96 points are too few for training an LSTM.\n\n    - Given the constraints, we might use a simple method: \n        * We can use the average of the same hour from the previous days to forecast the next days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n    - Another idea: use an AR model with lags. We can set the lag to 24 (for daily seasonality) and use an AR(24) model? But 96 points are too few for 24 lags.\n\n    - We can use a SARIMA model with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24). We'll try to fit a SARIMA model.\n\n 5. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any in the input, but for forecasting we assume the input is complete.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the small data, we might use a simple average method for each hour of the day. We have 4 days of data. We can compute the same hour across the 4 days and then average them to form a daily profile. Then we use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the simple method:\n   - Group by hour of the day (so 24 groups).\n   - For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 available values (if there are missing values we would have to handle, but we have 4 complete days?).\n   - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for that hour.\n\n But note: the data does not show a clear consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n   Example for hour 0: \n        2016-10-17 00:00:00: 4.622\n        2016-10-18 00:00:00: 2.947\n        2016-10-19 00:00:00: 3.885\n        2016-10-20 00:00:00: 1.808\n        Average = (4.622+2.947+3.885+1.808)/4 = 13.262/4 = 3.3155\n\n   Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n 7. However, the data also shows a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n        Day 1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: average = ... \n\n   We don't have a clear trend in 4 days. Also, the values on day 2 and day 3 are lower? But we are only forecasting 4 days ahead, so we might assume the same daily pattern without trend.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern? But that might be noisy.\n\n 9. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have to provide a forecast, we will use the average by hour method.\n\n 10. Steps for generating the next 96 hours:\n\n      - The last timestamp in the data is 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n      - The next 96 hours will be from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have an average value from the 4 days.\n\n      - Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n            Day 1 (2016-10-21): for hour 0, use the average for hour 0; ... hour 23: average for hour 23.\n            Day 2 (2016-10-22): same as above.\n\n 11. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the input might have missing values? But we are given 96 points without missing. So we use the available 4 days.\n\n 12. However, if we are to be robust, we should impute missing values in the input? But the input is complete. So we proceed.\n\n 13. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [4.622, 2.947, 3.885, 1.808] -> mean = (4.622+2.947+3.885+1.808)/4 = 3.3155\n        hour1: [4.354, 2.344, 3.416, 1.273] -> (4.354+2.344+3.416+1.273)/4 = 2.84675\n        hour2: [4.086, 2.143, 3.751, 2.545] -> (4.086+2.143+3.751+2.545)/4 = 3.13125\n        hour3: [4.555, 2.009, 3.282, 1.206] -> (4.555+2.009+3.282+1.206)/4 = 2.763\n        hour4: [4.019, 2.679, 3.014, 1.340] -> (4.019+2.679+3.014+1.340)/4 = 2.763\n        hour5: [4.220, 2.009, 3.282, 0.536] -> (4.220+2.009+3.282+0.536)/4 = 2.51175\n        hour6: [4.287, 1.808, 2.880, 1.206] -> (4.287+1.808+2.880+1.206)/4 = 2.54525\n        hour7: [4.287, 1.741, 3.014, 1.942] -> (4.287+1.741+3.014+1.942)/4 = 2.746\n        hour8: [3.684, 1.139, 3.215, 1.741] -> (3.684+1.139+3.215+1.741)/4 = 2.44475\n        hour9: [2.545, 1.608, 0.938, 1.139] -> (2.545+1.608+0.938+1.139)/4 = 1.5575\n        hour10: [2.947, 1.072, 1.407, 1.340] -> (2.947+1.072+1.407+1.340)/4 = 1.6915\n        hour11: [2.545, 1.608, 1.139, 1.407] -> (2.545+1.608+1.139+1.407)/4 = 1.67475\n        hour12: [1.674, 0.268, 0.469, 0.469] -> (1.674+0.268+0.469+0.469)/4 = 0.7200\n        hour13: [1.674, 0.000, 0.737, -0.067] -> (1.674+0.000+0.737-0.067)/4 = 0.586\n        hour14: [2.813, 1.005, 1.407, 1.340] -> (2.813+1.005+1.407+1.340)/4 = 1.64125\n        hour15: [2.545, 1.072, 1.139, 1.407] -> (2.545+1.072+1.139+1.407)/4 = 1.54075\n        hour16: [2.143, 0.067, 0.871, 1.005] -> (2.143+0.067+0.871+1.005)/4 = 1.0215\n        hour17: [2.009, -0.134, 0.536, 0.335] -> (2.009-0.134+0.536+0.335)/4 = 0.6865\n        hour18: [1.674, 0.134, 0.134, 0.067] -> (1.674+0.134+0.134+0.067)/4 = 0.50225\n        hour19: [1.875, 0.067, 0.000, -0.201] -> (1.875+0.067+0.000-0.201)/4 = 0.43525\n        hour20: [1.942, 0.000, 0.000, -0.335] -> (1.942+0.000+0.000-0.335)/4 = 0.40175\n        hour21: [1.340, -0.938, 0.134, 0.067] -> (1.340-0.938+0.134+0.067)/4 = 0.15075\n        hour22: [2.076, 2.143, 0.737, 1.808] -> (2.076+2.143+0.737+1.808)/4 = 1.691\n        hour23: [2.210, 3.014, 1.674, 1.741] -> (2.210+3.014+1.674+1.741)/4 = 2.15975\n\n 14. Now, we create the next 4 days (2016-10-21 to 2016-10-24) by repeating these 24 hourly averages for each day.\n\n 15. Format: We must output the next 96 records in the same format as the input, with the timestamp and the forecasted value.\n\n 16. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 17. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-21 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-10-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n 18. The forecasted values for each hour will be the average we computed for that hour.\n\n 19. Example:\n\n        2016-10-21 00:00:00  3.3155\n        2016-10-21 01:00:00  2.84675\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. We must round the numbers? The input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 21. But note: the problem does not specify rounding. We'll keep the same precision as the input (3 decimal places).\n\n 22. However, the computed averages might have more than 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 23. Let's compute the rounded values:\n\n        hour0: 3.3155 -> 3.316\n        hour1: 2.84675 -> 2.847\n        hour2: 3.13125 -> 3.131\n        hour3: 2.763 -> 2.763\n        hour4: 2.763 -> 2.763\n        hour5: 2.51175 -> 2.512\n        hour6: 2.54525 -> 2.545\n        hour7: 2.746 -> 2.746\n        hour8: 2.44475 -> 2.445\n        hour9: 1.5575 -> 1.558\n        hour10: 1.6915 -> 1.692\n        hour11: 1.67475 -> 1.675\n        hour12: 0.7200 -> 0.720\n        hour13: 0.586 -> 0.586\n        hour14: 1.64125 -> 1.641\n        hour15: 1.54075 -> 1.541\n        hour16: 1.0215 -> 1.022\n        hour17: 0.6865 -> 0.687\n        hour18: 0.50225 -> 0.502\n        hour19: 0.43525 -> 0.435\n        hour20: 0.40175 -> 0.402\n        hour21: 0.15075 -> 0.151\n        hour22: 1.691 -> 1.691\n        hour23: 2.15975 -> 2.160\n\n 24. Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-10-21, hours 0 to 23: [3.316, 2.847, 3.131, 2.763, 2.763, 2.512, 2.545, 2.746, 2.445, 1.558, 1.692, 1.675, 0.720, 0.586, 1.641, 1.541, 1.022, 0.687, 0.502, 0.435, 0.402, 0.151, 1.691, 2.160]\n        Day 2: 2016-10-22: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2016-10-23: same\n        Day 4: 2016-10-24: same\n\n 25. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-21 00:00:00  3.316\n2016-10-21 01:00:00  2.847\n... \n2016-10-24 23:00:00  2.160\n```\n\n 26. But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\" meaning the next 96 time points.\n\n 27. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2016, 10, 21, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            timestamp = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            value = hourly_avg[timestamp.hour]   # where hourly_avg is a list of 24 values\n\n 28. We have the list `hourly_avg` as above (rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n 29. However, note: the input data ends at 2016-10-20 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-10-21 00:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll code accordingly.\n\n 31. But note: the problem does not to use code, but to provide the data. So we will write the 96 lines.\n\n 32. Since 96 lines are too many to write manually, we can generate them in the response.\n\n 33. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 34. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we must write all 96 lines.\n\n 35. We'll generate the data as described.\n\n 36. Let's create the list of hourly averages for 24 hours (index 0 to 23) as:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            3.316, 2.847, 3.131, 2.763, 2.763, 2.512, 2.545, 2.746, \n            2.445, 1.558, 1.692, 1.675, 0.720, 0.586, 1.641, 1.541, \n            1.022, 0.687, 0.502, 0.435, 0.402, 0.151, 1.691, 2.160\n        ]\n\n 37. Then for each day from 2016-10-21 to 2016-10-24, we assign the 24 values.\n\n 38. We write the data:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-10-21: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24: index0 to index23\n        Day 2: 2016-10-22: same\n        Day 3: 2016-10-23: same\n        Day 4: 2016-10-24: same\n\n 39. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-21 00:00:00  3.316\n2016-10-21 01:00:00  2.847\n2016-10-21 02:00:00  3.131\n2016-10-21 03:00:00  2.763\n2016-10-21 04:00:00  2.763\n2016-10-21 05:00:00  2.512\n2016-10-21 06:00:00  2.545\n2016-10-21 07:00:00  2.746\n2016-10-21 08:00:00  2.445\n2016-10-21 09:00:00  1.558\n2016-10-21 10:00:00  1.692\n2016-10-21 11:00:00  1.675\n2016-10-21 12:00:00  0.720\n2016-10-21 13:00:00  0.586\n2016-10-21 14:00:00  1.641\n2016-10-21 15:00:00  1.541\n2016-10-21 16:00:00  1.022\n2016-10-21 17:00:00  0.687\n2016-10-21 18:00:00  0.502\n2016-10-21 19:00:00  0.435\n2016-10-21 20:00:00  0.402\n2016-10-21 21:00:00  0.151\n2016-10-21 22:00:00  1.691\n2016-10-21 23:00:00  2.160\n2016-10-22 00:00:00  3.316\n... and so on until 2016-10-24 23:00:00\n\n 40.
