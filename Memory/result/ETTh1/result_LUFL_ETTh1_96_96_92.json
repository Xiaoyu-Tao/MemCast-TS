        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00) for the \"LUFL\" (Low UseFul Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs).\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data? But the given 96 points are complete (no missing in the provided snippet).\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with a time series that has a daily seasonality (period=24) and we have only 4 days of data, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data is limited (only 96 points) and we are to forecast 96 points (another 4 days). We can use a seasonal model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.\n\n But given the constraints, we can also consider a simpler approach:\n  - The data shows a clear daily pattern. We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust for any trend or level.\n\n However, looking at the data, there might be a slight increasing trend? Let's check the first day and the last day:\n\n Day 1 (2017-07-04): \n   Min: 1.949, Max: 3.838\n Day 4 (2017-07-07): \n   Min: 3.107, Max: 5.300\n\n So there is an increasing trend. We note that the load is increasing over the 4 days.\n\n We can do:\n  1. Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n  2. Extrapolate the trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that automatically handles both trend and seasonality.\n\n Given the small data, we can use:\n   - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive or multiplicative seasonality). Since the seasonal pattern seems to have a relatively constant amplitude, additive might be appropriate.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   - Fit a Holt-Winters model with a seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n But note: we are not coding, we are to generate the forecast.\n\n However, without actual computation, we have to simulate the process.\n\n But the problem: we must output 96 numbers. How?\n\n We can:\n   - Compute the average daily pattern (by averaging the 4 days for each hour of the day) and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n How to get the trend?\n   - We can take the average of each day and then see the trend in the daily averages.\n\n Daily averages:\n   Day1: (2.345+2.254+...+2.802)/24 -> let's compute roughly:\n        We can approximate: the numbers are between 1.949 and 3.838, average around 3.0? \n        Actually, we can calculate:\n\n        Day1: \n          00:00 to 23:00: \n          [2.345, 2.254, 2.163, 1.949, 2.132, 2.589, 3.107, 2.894, 2.863, 3.107, 3.777, 3.533, 3.137, 2.924, 2.863, 2.985, 2.772, 3.320, 2.955, 3.046, 3.838, 3.686, 3.350, 2.802]\n          Sum = 2.345+2.254+2.163+1.949+2.132+2.589+3.107+2.894+2.863+3.107+3.777+3.533+3.137+2.924+2.863+2.985+2.772+3.320+2.955+3.046+3.838+3.686+3.350+2.802\n          = 70.351\n          Average = 70.351/24 = 2.931\n\n        Day2:\n          [2.528,2.376,2.406,2.315,2.254,3.137,3.381,2.955,3.503,2.894,3.259,3.076,3.381,3.320,3.168,3.015,3.411,3.564,3.168,3.168,4.538,4.082,3.777,3.229]\n          Sum = 2.528+2.376+2.406+2.315+2.254+3.137+3.381+2.955+3.503+2.894+3.259+3.076+3.381+3.320+3.168+3.015+3.411+3.564+3.168+3.168+4.538+4.082+3.777+3.229\n          = 75.245\n          Average = 75.245/24 = 3.135\n\n        Day3:\n          [3.168,2.924,2.772,2.498,2.437,3.442,3.320,3.320,2.924,2.924,3.320,3.533,3.503,3.442,3.381,3.411,3.198,3.137,3.411,3.716,4.873,4.630,4.142,3.807]\n          Sum = 3.168+2.924+2.772+2.498+2.437+3.442+3.320+3.320+2.924+2.924+3.320+3.533+3.503+3.442+3.381+3.411+3.198+3.137+3.411+3.716+4.873+4.630+4.142+3.807\n          = 80.313\n          Average = 80.313/24 = 3.346\n\n        Day4:\n          [3.533,3.259,3.320,3.107,3.107,3.503,3.716,3.442,3.777,3.686,4.051,4.295,3.472,3.777,3.229,3.411,3.594,3.868,3.442,3.990,5.300,4.873,3.838,3.442]\n          Sum = 3.533+3.259+3.320+3.107+3.107+3.503+3.716+3.442+3.777+3.686+4.051+4.295+3.472+3.777+3.229+3.411+3.594+3.868+3.442+3.990+5.300+4.873+3.838+3.442\n          = 85.251\n          Average = 85.251/24 = 3.552\n\n        Trend in daily averages: 2.931, 3.135, 3.346, 3.552 -> increasing by about 0.2 per day.\n\n        We can assume a linear trend: \n          slope = (3.552 - 2.931) / 3 = 0.207 per day.\n\n        So for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) the daily averages would be:\n          day5: 3.552 + 0.207 = 3.759\n          day6: 3.759 + 0.207 = 3.966\n          day7: 3.966 + 0.207 = 4.173\n          day8: 4.173 + 0.207 = 4.380\n\n  2. Now, we have the daily average for the next day, but we need the hourly pattern.\n\n        We can compute the seasonal indices (hourly) from the historical data.\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23), we average the 4 days and then normalize so that the average of the indices is 1? \n        But note: we are going to use the indices to distribute the daily average.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the average pattern as a fraction of the daily average.\n\n        Step:\n          For each hour h (0-23), compute:\n            index_h = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4   -> this is the absolute average for that hour.\n\n          Then the overall average of these 24 indices is the average of the 4 daily averages: (2.931+3.135+3.346+3.552)/4 = 3.241\n\n          Then the relative index for hour h: index_h / 3.241\n\n        But we want to apply it to the new daily averages? \n\n        For a new day with average = A, the value at hour h would be: (index_h) * (A / (overall average of indices))? \n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          value_{h} = (index_h) * (A / (average of the 24 indices for that day in the base period)) \n\n        However, note that the base period the average of the 24 indices for a day is the daily average of that day. But we have 4 different daily averages.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the relative index for each hour as the average of the 4 days' relative deviations:\n\n          For each day d and hour h: relative_value_{d,h} = value_{d,h} / (daily_avg_d)\n\n          Then the index for hour h = average(relative_value_{d,h} for d in [1,2,3,4])\n\n        Then for a new day with average A, the value at hour h is: A * index_h.\n\n        This way, the daily average of the new day will be A * (average of index_h over h) and we want that to be 1? Actually, the average of the relative indices should be 1.\n\n        Let me check: \n          For each day, the average of (value_{d,h}/daily_avg_d) over h is 1.\n\n        So the average of the indices (over h) of the 4-day average relative indices should be 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n          index_h = ( (value_day1_h / 2.931) + (value_day2_h / 3.135) + (value_day3_h / 3.346) + (value_day4_h / 3.552) ) / 4\n\n        Then for day5 (with average 3.759), the value at hour h is: 3.759 * index_h.\n\n  3. We do this for each hour of the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n However, note: the data might have noise and we are using a simple method. Also, the trend might not be exactly linear and might level off? But we only have 4 days.\n\n But the problem: we are to forecast 96 points. We have to generate 96 numbers.\n\n Let's compute the indices:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the relative index.\n\n   Example for hour0 (00:00):\n        Day1: 2.345 / 2.931 = 0.8001\n        Day2: 2.528 / 3.135 = 0.8064\n        Day3: 3.168 / 3.346 = 0.9465\n        Day4: 3.533 / 3.552 = 0.9947\n        index0 = (0.8001+0.8064+0.9465+0.9947)/4 = 0.8769\n\n   Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then for day5 (2017-07-08) at 00:00:00: 3.759 * 0.8769 = 3.297\n\n   Then for 01:00:00: we compute index1 and then 3.759 * index1, and so on.\n\n   For day6: use 3.966 * index_h, etc.\n\n 4. But note: the dates must be generated. The last date in the input is 2017-07-07 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-07-08 23:00:00   -> 24 hours\n        then 2017-07-09 00:00:00 to 2017-07-09 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        then 2017-07-10 ... and 2017-07-11 ... until 2017-07-11 23:00:00 -> total 96.\n\n 5. However, we must be cautious: the data provided might have a pattern that is not only daily?

But note: the trend might be too strong? The last day (day4) had a maximum of 5.300, and we are forecasting for day5 at hour20: 5.361, then day6: 3.966 * 1.42625 = 5.656, day7: 4.173 * 1.42625 = 5.951, day8: 4.380 * 1.42625 = 6.247. \n\n    This might be acceptable if the trend continues. But we are extrapolating a linear trend from only 4 points.\n\n 10. We'll generate the entire 96 points accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the provided data? But the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't need to impute for the historical data.\n\n 11. We output the data in the required format.\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete data\" meaning we must not omit any of the 96 forecasted points.\n\n Let's write the indices in a list:\n\n    indices = [0.876925, 0.8295, 0.817075, 0.756075, 0.762275, 0.974625, 1.04415, 0.972725, 1.007775, 0.9736, 1.11515, 1.11285, 1.043225, 1.037075, 0.97665, 0.989875, 1.000275, 1.0739, 1.0017, 1.070825, 1.42625, 1.32875, 1.166125, 1.023075]\n\n    daily_avgs = [3.759, 3.966, 4.173, 4.380]\n\n    Then for day i (0-indexed for the first forecast day5) and hour h (0-23):\n\n        value = daily_avgs[i] * indices[h]\n\n    The date for the first point: 2017-07-08 00:00:00\n\n    We generate 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n 12. We must format the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-08 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-08 01:00:00, ... 2017-07-08 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-09 00:00:00 ... 2017-07-09 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-10 00:00:00 ... 2017-07-10 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-11 00:00:00 ... 2017-07-11 23:00:00\n\n 13. We write the data in the same format: two columns, space separated.\n\n 14. We must be cautious: the indices we computed are approximate because we used rounded daily averages and rounded values. We should use more precise values.\n\n    Let me recompute the daily averages more precisely:\n\n        Day1: \n          Sum = 2.345+2.254+2.163+1.949+2.132+2.589+3.107+2.894+2.863+3.107+3.777+3.533+3.137+2.924+2.863+2.985+2.772+3.320+2.955+3.046+3.838+3.686+3.350+2.802\n          = 70.351\n          day1_avg = 70.351/24 = 2.9312916666666667\n\n        Day2:\n          Sum = 2.528+2.376+2.406+2.315+2.254+3.137+3.381+2.955+3.503+2.894+3.259+3.076+3.381+3.320+3.168+3.015+3.411+3.564+3.168+3.168+4.538+4.082+3.777+3.229\n          = 75.245\n          day2_avg = 75.245/24 = 3.1352083333333335\n\n        Day3:\n          Sum = 3.168+2.924+2.772+2.498+2.437+3.442+3.320+3.320+2.924+2.924+3.320+3.533+3.503+3.442+3.381+3.411+3.198+3.137+3.411+3.716+4.873+4.630+4.142+3.807\n          = 80.313\n          day3_avg = 80.313/24 = 3.346375\n\n        Day4:\n          Sum = 3.533+3.259+3.320+3.107+3.107+3.503+3.716+3.442+3.777+3.686+4.051+4.295+3.472+3.777+3.229+3.411+3.594+3.868+3.442+3.990+5.300+4.873+3.838+3.442\n          = 85.251\n          day4_avg = 85.251/24 = 3.552125\n\n        Then the daily averages: [2.9312916666666667, 3.1352083333333335, 3.346375, 3.552125]\n\n        The slope: (3.552125 - 2.9312916666666667) / 3 = (0.6208333333333333) / 3 = 0.20694444444444444\n\n        Then:\n          day5_avg = 3.552125 + 0.20694444444444444 = 3.7590694444444444\n          day6_avg = 3.7590694444444444 + 0.20694444444444444 = 3.966013888888889\n          day7_avg = 3.966013888888889 + 0.20694444444444444 = 4.172958333333333\n          day8_avg = 4.172958333333333 + 0.20694444444444444 = 4.379902777777778\n\n    Now, we recompute the indices with more precision.\n\n    But note: we are to output the data with 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n    We'll compute the indices with the precise daily averages.\n\n    However, to save time, we can use the indices we computed earlier (with 4 decimals) and then multiply by the precise daily averages, and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n    But for accuracy, we should recompute the indices with the precise daily averages.\n\n    Alternatively, we can note that the relative indices we computed earlier are already an approximation. We'll use the same method but with the precise daily averages.\n\n    But the problem: we are doing by hand? We have to output 96 numbers. We decide to use the indices we computed (with 4-6 decimals) and then multiply by the precise daily averages and round to 3 decimals.\n\n    We'll use the indices list as computed above (with the rounded daily averages) because we don't have the exact relative indices with the precise daily averages. But we can recalc one or two to see the difference.\n\n    Example for hour0:\n\n        With precise daily averages:\n\n        Day1: 2.345 / 2.9312916666666667 = 0.8000 (approx: 0.8000)\n        Day2: 2.528 / 3.1352083333333335 = 0.8063\n        Day3: 3.168 / 3.346375 = 0.9463\n        Day4: 3.533 / 3.552125 = 0.9947\n\n        avg = (0.8000+0.8063+0.9463+0.9947)/4 = 0.876825\n\n        Previously we had 0.876925 -> very close.\n\n    So we'll use the indices we computed (with the rounded daily averages) and then multiply by the precise daily averages.\n\n    We'll round the final LUFL to 3 decimals.\n\n 15. We generate the 96 points.\n\n    indices = [ \n        0.876925, 0.8295, 0.817075, 0.756075, 0.762275, 0.974625, \n        1.04415, 0.972725, 1.007775, 0.9736, 1.11515, 1.11285, \n        1.043225, 1.037075, 0.97665, 0.989875, 1.000275, 1.0739, \n        1.0017, 1.070825, 1.42625, 1.32875, 1.166125, 1.023075 \n    ]\n\n    daily_avgs = [3.7590694444444444, 3.966013888888889, 4.172958333333333, 4.379902777777778]\n\n    We'll create a list of 96 points:\n\n        for day_index in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                value = daily_avgs[day_index] * indices[hour]\n                rounded_value = round(value, 3)\n\n    Then assign the date accordingly.\n\n 16. We write the output.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data.

We generated the above by:\n\n        for i in range(4):\n            for j in range(24):\n                value = daily_avgs[i] * indices[j]\n                rounded_value = round(value, 3)\n\n        And then we formatted the date accordingly.\n\n 25. We hope this is acceptable.\n\n Note: This is a simple method and might not be as accurate as a more sophisticated model, but given the data and the constraints, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n We output the complete 96 points.\n",
