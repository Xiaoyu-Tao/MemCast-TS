        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 24*4=96 points).\n 3. We must choose a suitable time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history and the data appears to have daily seasonality (24 hours in a day), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n Options:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with seasonality of 24 hours.\n   - Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters).\n   - Given the data is relatively short, we might also consider simpler models.\n\n However, note that the data does not show a strong trend but does show some daily pattern (e.g., higher during the day, lower at night?).\n\n But looking at the data: \n   - The values range between about 1.0 and 2.5, and there are fluctuations.\n\n Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 96 points (next 4 days), we can try to capture the daily pattern.\n\n Approach:\n   We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a model like SARIMA.\n\n However, note: the data might have multiple seasonality? But we are given hourly data and we see a daily cycle.\n\n Let's check the seasonality: \n   We have 4 days. We can average by hour of the day to see the pattern.\n\n But note: the data is only 4 days, so we have 4 observations per hour (for each hour of the day). We can compute the average for each hour.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n   - Use the last available day (or average of the 4 days) as the pattern and then adjust by the overall level.\n\n However, the data does not look very stable. For example, the values on 2017-08-24 are generally lower than the first day.\n\n We can try to model with a linear trend and seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, we must provide 96 values, and we cannot omit any.\n\n We'll use:\n   - SARIMA: (p,d,q) for non-seasonal part and (P,D,Q,s) for seasonal part with s=24.\n\n Steps for modeling:\n   - Check stationarity: if not stationary, we may need to difference (d and D).\n   - We have only 96 points, so we cannot use too many parameters.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: \n   - Naive approach: use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But the data shows a downward trend? \n     Let's see: \n        Day1: min=1.553, max=2.498\n        Day2: min=1.279, max=2.010\n        Day3: min=1.188, max=1.797\n        Day4: min=1.097, max=1.645\n\n   The maximum value is decreasing. So we cannot simply repeat the last day.\n\n Another idea: \n   - Use the average of the four days for each hour, and then project a linear trend? \n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n However, we are to forecast 96 points. We can use:\n\n   Model: \n      y(t) = trend(t) + seasonal(t) + noise\n\n   We can decompose the series into trend and seasonal components using moving averages, but with only 4 days, the trend might be linear.\n\n   Steps for decomposition:\n      - Compute a moving average to get the trend (with window=24, centered) but we lose 12 hours at the beginning and end? \n        Since we have only 4 days, we can use a window of 24 to get the trend for the middle two days? Then we can extrapolate the trend linearly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use STL decomposition? But with only 4 days, it might be too short.\n\n Given the complexity and the small data, we can use:\n\n   - A linear regression with:\n        y ~ t (linear trend) + hour_of_day (as categorical)\n\n   We can fit a model:\n\n        y = beta0 + beta1 * t + beta_hour * I_hour\n\n   where t is the time index (from 1 to 96) and I_hour is the hour of the day (0-23).\n\n   Then for forecasting, we extend t from 97 to 192, and the hour of the day for the next 96 hours.\n\n   However, note: the trend might not be linear? But with 4 days, we can assume linear.\n\n   Let's try to fit a linear model with hour dummies.\n\n   Steps:\n      - Create a time index: 1 to 96.\n      - Create 24 dummy variables for the hour (or use a factor for hour).\n\n   But we have 96 points and 24 dummies plus a trend, so 25 parameters: that's acceptable.\n\n   However, we might have multicollinearity? But the trend and the hour dummies are not perfectly collinear.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        y = intercept + t * trend_coef + hour0 + hour1 + ... + hour23\n\n   But note: we have to leave one hour out as reference? Actually, we can use all 24 and drop the intercept? Or use an intercept and 23 dummies.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use cyclic encoding for the hour? But for simplicity, we can use 24 dummies without an intercept? \n\n   Actually, we can use:\n\n        y = trend_coef * t + hour0_coef * I(hour=0) + ... + hour23_coef * I(hour=23)\n\n   Then we have 25 parameters.\n\n   We fit the model on the 96 points.\n\n   Then for forecasting, we assign:\n        t from 97 to 192, and the hour for each time.\n\n   But note: the data might have a decreasing trend. The model will capture that.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the trend might not be linear? But with 4 days, it's a reasonable approximation.\n\n   Let's compute the trend: \n        We can do a linear regression on the entire series without seasonality? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of each day to see the trend:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values of day1)/24\n        Day2: ... \n\n        Day1: average = (1.828+1.919+...+1.645)/24 -> let's compute quickly:\n\n        We can approximate: \n          Day1: values are around 1.5 to 2.5 -> average about 2.0?\n          Day2: 1.279 to 2.010 -> average about 1.7?\n          Day3: 1.188 to 1.797 -> average about 1.5?\n          Day4: 1.097 to 1.645 -> average about 1.3?\n\n        So the daily averages: [2.0, 1.7, 1.5, 1.3] -> a linear trend: decreasing by about 0.3 per day.\n\n   So a linear trend might be appropriate.\n\n   We'll fit a linear model with hour dummies and a linear trend.\n\n   Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to do it manually? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a statistical package? But we are to provide the forecast without code.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the overall linear trend: \n                Let y_bar(i) = average of day i (i=1,2,3,4)\n                Then the trend: \n                    slope = (y_bar(4) - y_bar(1)) / 3   [because from day1 to day4 is 3 intervals]\n\n                Then the daily decrease is about: (1.3 - 2.0)/3 = -0.7/3 \u2248 -0.2333 per day.\n\n        Step 3: For each hour in the future, we assign:\n                base = average of that hour over the 4 days\n                then adjust by the trend: for day5 (which is the first day of forecast) we are 4 days from day1? \n                Actually, the last day in the data is day4 (2017-08-24). The next day is 2017-08-25.\n\n                We can set the level for day5 as: level(5) = level(4) - 0.2333? \n                But we have 4 days of data: \n                    day1: 2017-08-21 -> level1 = 2.0\n                    day2: 2017-08-22 -> level2 = 1.7\n                    day3: 2017-08-23 -> level3 = 1.5\n                    day4: 2017-08-24 -> level4 = 1.3\n\n                Then for day5: level5 = level4 - 0.2333 = 1.3 - 0.2333 = 1.0667\n                day6: 1.0667 - 0.2333 = 0.8334\n                day7: 0.8334 - 0.2333 = 0.6001\n                day8: 0.6001 - 0.2333 = 0.3668\n\n                But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) so we need 4 days.\n\n        Step 4: For each hour h (0-23) in the future day, we take the average of that hour from the historical 4 days and then adjust by the daily level?\n\n                However, the daily level is the average of the day. So we can compute the relative pattern for each hour.\n\n                We can compute the deviation for each hour from the daily average in the historical data.\n\n                For example, for hour0:\n                    historical: \n                         day1: 1.828 -> deviation = 1.828 - 2.0 = -0.172\n                         day2: 1.675 -> deviation = 1.675 - 1.7 = -0.025\n                         day3: 1.553 -> deviation = 1.553 - 1.5 = 0.053\n                         day4: 1.279 -> deviation = 1.279 - 1.3 = -0.021\n\n                    average deviation for hour0: (-0.172 -0.025+0.053-0.021)/4 = (-0.165)/4 = -0.04125\n\n                Then for day5, hour0: \n                    forecast = level5 + average_deviation_hour0 = 1.0667 - 0.04125 \u2248 1.02545\n\n                Similarly for other hours.\n\n        Step 5: But note: the daily level we computed (1.0667 for day5) is the average of the day. We are then adding the hourly pattern.\n\n        However, we have 4 days of data and we are averaging the deviations. This might be reasonable.\n\n        But we must compute the daily average for each day in the historical data.\n\n        How to compute the daily average for each day?\n\n            Day1 (2017-08-21): \n                values: 24 points -> average = (1.828+1.919+1.919+2.071+2.193+2.102+2.254+2.376+2.498+2.254+2.163+2.102+1.949+2.010+1.949+1.858+1.919+1.888+1.614+1.553+1.645+1.828+1.706+1.645) / 24\n\n            Let me compute:\n\n                Sum = 1.828+1.919+1.919+2.071+2.193+2.102+2.254+2.376+2.498+2.254+2.163+2.102+1.949+2.010+1.949+1.858+1.919+1.888+1.614+1.553+1.645+1.828+1.706+1.645\n                = 48.183\n                average = 48.183/24 = 2.007625\n\n            Day2 (2017-08-22):\n                values: 24 points -> \n                1.675,1.614,1.340,1.462,1.462,1.767,1.858,1.980,2.010,1.828,1.919,1.523,1.736,1.371,1.279,1.340,1.492,1.462,1.401,1.645,1.523,1.523,1.523,1.462\n\n                Sum = 1.675+1.614+1.340+1.462+1.462+1.767+1.858+1.980+2.010+1.828+1.919+1.523+1.736+1.371+1.279+1.340+1.492+1.462+1.401+1.645+1.523+1.523+1.523+1.462\n                = 38.336\n                average = 38.336/24 = 1.597333\n\n            Day3 (2017-08-23):\n                values: 24 points ->\n                1.553,1.492,1.432,1.371,1.432,1.340,1.249,1.371,1.432,1.401,1.553,1.310,1.340,1.218,1.371,1.188,1.371,1.340,1.218,1.249,1.523,1.371,1.797,1.401\n\n                Sum = 1.553+1.492+1.432+1.371+1.432+1.340+1.249+1.371+1.432+1.401+1.553+1.310+1.340+1.218+1.371+1.188+1.371+1.340+1.218+1.249+1.523+1.371+1.797+1.401\n                = 33.290\n                average = 33.290/24 = 1.387083\n\n            Day4 (2017-08-24):\n                values: 24 points ->\n                1.279,1.157,1.097,1.249,1.310,1.401,1.340,1.310,1.492,1.645,1.371,1.401,1.340,1.371,1.432,1.371,1.401,1.432,1.340,1.310,1.371,1.097,1.553,1.127\n\n                Sum = 1.279+1.157+1.097+1.249+1.310+1.401+1.340+1.310+1.492+1.645+1.371+1.401+1.340+1.371+1.432+1.371+1.401+1.432+1.340+1.310+1.371+1.097+1.553+1.127\n                = 30.744\n                average = 30.744/24 = 1.281\n\n        So the daily averages: [2.007625, 1.597333, 1.387083, 1.281]\n\n        The daily decrease: \n            from day1 to day2: 1.597333 - 2.007625 = -0.410292\n            day2 to day3: 1.387083 - 1.597333 = -0.21025\n            day3 to day4: 1.281 - 1.387083 = -0.106083\n\n        The decreases are not constant.

But we only have 4 days. We'll proceed with the linear trend.\n\n        Now, for the hourly pattern:\n\n            For each hour h (0 to 23), we compute the deviation from the daily average for each of the 4 days.\n\n            Then we average the deviations for each hour.\n\n            Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n                day1: 1.828 - 2.007625 = -0.179625\n                day2: 1.675 - 1.597333 = 0.077667\n                day3: 1.553 - 1.387083 = 0.165917\n                day4: 1.279 - 1.281 = -0.002\n                average_dev_h0 = (-0.179625+0.077667+0.165917-0.002)/4 = 0.061959/4 = 0.01548975\n\n            Similarly for other hours.\n\n        Then for the forecast for day5, hour0: \n            forecast = daily_average(day5) + average_dev_h0 = 0.970729 + 0.01548975 \u2248 0.98621875\n\n        We do this for every hour in the 4 days.\n\n        The dates for the next 96 hours:\n            Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00 (day5, hour0)\n            Then 2017-08-25 01:00:00 (day5, hour1) ... until 2017-08-28 23:00:00 (day8, hour23)\n\n        We have 4 days: day5, day6, day7, day8.\n\n        We'll compute the daily average for each of these days using the linear trend.\n\n        Then for each hour in a day, we add the average deviation for that hour.\n\n        However, note: the average deviation we computed is over 4 days. We assume that the hourly pattern is stable.\n\n        Let's compute the average deviation for each hour:\n\n            We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the average deviation.\n\n            We have the historical data:\n\n                hour0: [1.179625, 0.077667, 0.165917, -0.002] -> average = 0.01548975\n                hour1: \n                    day1: 1.919 - 2.007625 = -0.088625\n                    day2: 1.614 - 1.597333 = 0.016667\n                    day3: 1.492 - 1.387083 = 0.104917\n                    day4: 1.157 - 1.281 = -0.124\n                    average = (-0.088625+0.016667+0.104917-0.124)/4 = (-0.090041)/4 = -0.02251025\n\n            ... and so on.\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n        Then we can build the forecast.\n\n        Steps for the forecast:\n\n            For day in [5,6,7,8]:\n                daily_avg = 2.1657915 - 0.2390125 * (day_index)   [where day_index: 5,6,7,8]\n                for hour in 0..23:\n                    value = daily_avg + avg_deviation[hour]\n\n        We must compute the avg_deviation for all 24 hours.\n\n        But note: we have to be cautious because the linear trend might be too aggressive. However, we'll proceed.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the trend? But we are using the average pattern.\n\n        Let's compute the average deviations for all 24 hours:\n\n            We'll create a list for the average deviations.\n\n            We'll compute:\n\n                hour0: 0.01548975\n                hour1: -0.02251025\n                hour2: \n                    day1: 1.919 -

The problem does not specify, but we know that the load cannot be negative. \n        We'll set any negative forecast to 0.0? But the historical minimum is 1.097. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a multiplicative model? But we started with additive.\n\n        Given the time, we'll proceed and then clip at 0.0.\n\n        However, let's check day8, hour15: \n            daily_avg = 0.2536915\n            deviation for hour15 = -0.12901025\n            forecast = 0.2536915 - 0.12901025 = 0.12468125 (positive)\n\n        Let's check the most negative: \n            hour23: deviation = -0.15951025 -> 0.2536915 -0.15951025 = 0.09418125 (positive)\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        We'll generate the next 96 points.\n\n        We'll write the dates:\n\n            Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00 (day5, hour0)\n            Then 2017-08-25 01:00:00 (day5, hour1)\n            ... until 2017-08-28 23:00:00 (day8, hour23)\n\n        We have 4 days: 24*4=96.\n\n        We'll compute:\n\n            For i in range(0,96):\n                day_index = 5 + i//24   [because the first 24 hours are day5, then day6, etc.]\n                hour_index = i % 24\n\n                value = 2.1657915 - 0.2390125 * day_index + avg_deviation[hour_index]\n\n        But note: the day_index for the first forecast day is 5, then 6,7,8.\n\n        We have the avg_deviation for each hour (0 to 23) in a list.\n\n        Let's list the avg_deviations in order:\n\n            hour0: 0.01548975\n            hour1: -0.02251025\n            hour2: -0.12126025\n            hour3: -0.03001025\n            hour4: 0.03098975\n            hour5: 0.08423975\n            hour6: 0.10698975\n            hour7: 0.19098975\n            hour8: 0.28973975\n            hour9: 0.21373975\n            hour10: 0.18323975\n            hour11: 0.01573975\n            hour12: 0.02298975\n            hour13: -0.07576025\n            hour14: -0.06051025\n            hour15: -0.12901025\n            hour16: -0.02251025\n            hour17: -0.03776025\n            hour18: -0.17501025\n            hour19: -0.12901025\n            hour20: -0.05276025\n            hour21: -0.11351025\n            hour22: 0.07648975\n            hour23: -0.15951025\n\n        We'll compute the forecast for each of the 96 points.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimals.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n            value = round( (2.1657915 - 0.2390125 * day_index + avg_deviation[hour_index]), 3)\n\n        But note: the linear regression was done on the daily averages, and the deviations were computed from the daily averages. This is additive.\n\n        We'll generate the data.\n\n        However, note: the dates must be in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n        The last date in the given data is 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n\n        The next date is 2017-08-25 00:00:00.\n\n        We'll generate:\n\n            2017-08-25 00:00:00: value = 0.1657915 - 0.2390125*5 + 0.01548975 = 0.970729 + 0.01548975 = 0.98621875 -> 0.986\n            2017-08-25 01:00:00: 0.970729 -0.02251025 = 0.9482185 -> 0.948\n            ...\n\n        We'll do the computation for all 96.\n\n        But note: we must be cautious of floating point precision.\n\n        We'll write a program in our mind? We can do a table.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write a small code in our mind and then output.\n\n        Given the length, we'll output the first few and then the rest similarly.\n\n        We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n        However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the provided data? But we were given 96 points without missing. \n        So we don't need to worry about imputation for the historical data.\n\n        We are to provide the next 96 points.\n\n        We'll generate the data in the format:\n\n            date, LULL\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Let's do the first day (2017-08-25) as an example:\n\n            hour0: 0.986\n            hour1: 0.948\n            hour2: 0.849\n            hour3: 0.941\n            hour4: 1.002\n            hour5: 1.055\n            hour6: 1.078\n            hour7: 1.162\n            hour8: 1.260\n            hour9: 1.184\n            hour10: 1.154\n            hour11: 0.986\n            hour12: 0.994\n            hour13: 0.895\n            hour14: 0.910\n            hour15: 0.842\n            hour16: 0.948\n            hour17: 0.933\n            hour18: 0.796\n            hour19: 0.842\n            hour20: 0.918\n            hour21: 0.857\n            hour22: 1.047\n            hour23: 0.811\n\n        Then day6 (2017-08-26): daily_avg = 0.7317165\n\n            hour0: 0.7317165 + 0.01548975 = 0.74720625 -> 0.747\n            hour1: 0.7317165 -0.02251025 = 0.70920625 -> 0.709\n            ... and so on.\n\n        We'll do this for 4 days.\n\n        We'll write the full 96 lines.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must provide all 96.\n\n        We'll generate the dates:\n\n            Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n            End: 2017-08-28 23:00:00\n\n        We'll create a list of dates:\n\n            import pandas as pd\n            start_date

do manually? 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n            Day5: 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-25 23:00:00\n            Day6: 2017-08-26 00:00:00 to 2017-08-26 23:00:00\n            Day7:

-0.15951025]\n\n        Then for day i (0-indexed for the forecast days: 0,1,2,3) and hour j (0 to 23):\n\n            value = daily_avg[i] + deviations[j]\n\n            then round to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll generate:\n\n            Day0 (2017-08-25): \n                for j in 0..23: value = 0.970729 + deviations[j] -> then round\n            Day1 (2017-08-26): \n                for j in

cause some values to be 0.000, but we'll see.\n\n        Let's compute the first few:\n\n            Day0, hour0: 0.970729 + 0.01548975 = 0.98621875 -> 0.986\n            Day0, hour1: 0.970729

We'll output without quotes.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n            [date string] [space] [value]\n\n        But the example input had:\n\n            \"2017-08-21 00:00:00 1.828\"\n\n        Actually, the example input was:\n\n            \"2017-08-21 00:00:00 1.828\"\n\n        But in the text, it was shown as:\n\n               date  LULL\n            2017-08-21 00:00:00 1.828\n\n        So we'll output:\n\n            [date string] [space] [value]\n\n        But note: the example had the date string and then the value without a comma? \n\n        Actually, the example had:\n\n            \"2017-08-21 00:00:00 1.828\"\n\n        But in the markdown, it was aligned in two columns. We'll output with a space.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n        We'll output 96 lines.\n\n        We'll write in the answer block.\n\n        Let's do it.\n",
