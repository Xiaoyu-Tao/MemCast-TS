        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load tends to have peaks and troughs at similar times each day.\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data? But the given 96 points are consecutive without missing values? \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete. \n    So for the given data we don't have missing values, but we must be cautious for the future forecast? \n    Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n    It might be that the provided data has missing values? But in the example given, we have 96 consecutive points without missing.\n\n    However, the instruction is about the data we are going to forecast: we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates without any missing.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any, but from the data the trend is not obvious over 4 days, but we have only 4 days of history)\n    - Seasonality: daily seasonality (period=24)\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a simple seasonal model.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal naive method: \n        y_{t+k} = y_{t+k-24}   for k=1,2,...,24, then for k=25,...,48: y_{t+k}=y_{t+k-24} (which is the same as the first day of forecast) and so on.\n\n    But note: the data we have is 4 days (96 hours). We can use the last day (the 4th day) as the pattern for the next days? \n    However, the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4-day window? \n\n    Actually, we are only given 4 days (96 hours) to base our forecast. So we don't have a long history.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use the average of the four days for each hour? \n\n    Let's break the data into 4 days (each 24 hours). Then for each hour (0 to 23) we can compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be:\n        Day 5: hour0 = average of hour0 from day1, day2, day3, day4\n               hour1 = average of hour1 from day1, day2, day3, day4\n               ... and so on.\n\n    But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points we don't have missing. \n    So we can compute the hourly average.\n\n 7. However, looking at the data, there is a slight variation day by day. But without more history, the average per hour might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 8. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n    We have 4 days: \n        Day1: 2017-02-02 (index 0-23)\n        Day2: 2017-02-03 (index 24-47)\n        Day3: 2017-02-04 (index 48-71)\n        Day4: 2017-02-05 (index 72-95)\n\n    For hour0 (00:00): \n        values: -2.452, -2.523, -2.487, -2.630 -> average = (-2.452 -2.523 -2.487 -2.630)/4 = -2.092/4? Let me calculate:\n\n        Actually: \n          -2.452 -2.523 = -4.975\n          -4.975 -2.487 = -7.462\n          -7.462 -2.630 = -10.092\n          average = -10.092 / 4 = -2.523\n\n    Similarly, we compute for each hour.\n\n 9. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? In the provided data we don't have missing, so we can compute the average.\n\n 10. However, the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning that in the provided data there might be missing? \n     But the provided 96 points are complete. So we proceed.\n\n 11. We'll create a list of 24 averages, one for each hour.\n\n 12. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n        Day5: hour0 to hour23: the 24 averages\n        Day6: same 24 averages\n        Day7: same\n        Day8: same\n\n 13. But note: the dates for the next 96 hours: \n        The last date in the given data is 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n        The next 96 hours would be from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n 14. We must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n2017-02-06 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-02-06 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-02-09 23:00:00 <value>\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 15. Implementation:\n\n     Step 1: Parse the given data and split into 4 days (each 24 hours).\n     Step 2: For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n     Step 3: Repeat this list of 24 averages 4 times (for the next 4 days).\n\n 16. However, we note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. \n     Also, we are forecasting 4 days ahead, so without trend information, the average is a safe choice.\n\n 17. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00): \n        days: [0, 24, 48, 72] -> indices: 0,24,48,72\n        values: -2.452, -2.523, -2.487, -2.630 -> average = (-2.452 -2.523 -2.487 -2.630)/4 = -10.092/4 = -2.523\n\n     Hour 1 (01:00): \n        indices: 1,25,49,73 -> -2.559, -2.630, -2.594, -2.772 -> \n        sum = -2.559 -2.630 -2.594 -2.772 = -10.555 -> avg = -10.555/4 = -2.63875\n\n     Hour 2 (02:00): \n        indices: 2,26,50,74 -> -2.594, -2.772, -2.701, -2.843 -> \n        sum = -2.594 -2.772 -2.701 -2.843 = -10.91 -> avg = -10.91/4 = -2.7275\n\n     Hour 3 (03:00): \n        indices: 3,27,51,75 -> -2.701, -2.701, -2.736, -2.878 -> \n        sum = -2.701*2 = -5.402, then -5.402 -2.736 = -8.138, then -8.138 -2.878 = -11.016 -> avg = -11.016/4 = -2.754\n\n     Hour 4 (04:00): \n        indices: 4,28,52,76 -> -2.736, -2.807, -2.914, -2.843 -> \n        sum = -2.736 -2.807 = -5.543, -5.543 -2.914 = -8.457, -8.457 -2.843 = -11.3 -> avg = -11.3/4 = -2.825\n\n     Hour 5 (05:00): \n        indices: 5,29,53,77 -> -2.736, -2.807, -2.807, -2.843 -> \n        sum = -2.736 -2.807 -2.807 -2.843 = -11.193 -> avg = -11.193/4 = -2.79825\n\n     Hour 6 (06:00): \n        indices: 6,30,54,78 -> -2.701, -2.807, -2.807, -2.843 -> \n        sum = -2.701 -2.807 -2.807 -2.843 = -11.158 -> avg = -11.158/4 = -2.7895\n\n     Hour 7 (07:00): \n        indices: 7,31,55,79 -> -2.594, -2.736, -2.701, -2.736 -> \n        sum = -2.594 -2.736 = -5.33, -5.33 -2.701 = -8.031, -8.031 -2.736 = -10.767 -> avg = -10.767/4 = -2.69175\n\n     Hour 8 (08:00): \n        indices: 8,32,56,80 -> -2.203, -2.345, -2.274, -2.274 -> \n        sum = -2.203 -2.345 = -4.548, -4.548 -2.274 = -6.822, -6.822 -2.274 = -9.096 -> avg = -9.096/4 = -2.274\n\n     Hour 9 (09:00): \n        indices: 9,33,57,81 -> -2.310, -2.452, -2.381, -2.239 -> \n        sum = -2.310 -2.452 = -4.762, -4.762 -2.381 = -7.143, -7.143 -2.239 = -9.382 -> avg = -9.382/4 = -2.3455\n\n     Hour 10 (10:00): \n        indices: 10,34,58,82 -> -2.381, -2.452, -2.381, -2.132 -> \n        sum = -2.381 -2.452 = -4.833, -4.833 -2.381 = -7.214, -7.214 -2.132 = -9.346 -> avg = -9.346/4 = -2.3365\n\n     Hour 11 (11:00): \n        indices: 11,35,59,83 -> -2.274, -2.345, -2.345, -2.025 -> \n        sum = -2.274 -2.345 = -4.619, -4.619 -2.345 = -6.964, -6.964 -2.025 = -8.989 -> avg = -8.989/4 = -2.24725\n\n     Hour 12 (12:00): \n        indices: 12,36,60,84 -> -2.097, -2.345, -2.416, -2.345 -> \n        sum = -2.097 -2.345 = -4.442, -4.442 -2.416 = -6.858, -6.858 -2.345 = -9.203 -> avg = -9.203/4 = -2.30075\n\n     Hour 13 (13:00): \n        indices: 13,37,61,85 -> -1.883, -2.239, -2.097, -2.097 -> \n        sum = -1.883 -2.239 = -4.122, -4.122 -2.097 = -6.219, -6.219 -2.097 = -8.316 -> avg = -8.316/4 = -2.079\n\n     Hour 14 (14:00): \n        indices: 14,38,62,86 -> -1.990, -2.239, -1.954, -1.564 -> \n        sum = -1.990 -2.239 = -4.229, -4.229 -1.954 = -6.183, -6.183 -1.564 = -7.747 -> avg = -7.747/4 = -1.93675\n\n     Hour 15 (15:00): \n        indices: 15,39,63,87 -> -1.883, -2.203, -2.203, -1.883 -> \n        sum = -1.883 -2.203 = -4.086, -4.086 -2.203 = -6.289, -6.289 -1.883 = -8.172 -> avg = -8.172/4 = -2.043\n\n     Hour 16 (16:00): \n        indices: 16,40,64,88 -> -2.203, -2.025, -2.274, -2.239 -> \n        sum = -2.203 -2.025 = -4.228, -4.228 -2.274 = -6.502, -6.502 -2.239 = -8.741 -> avg = -8.741/4 = -2.18525\n\n     Hour 17 (17:00): \n        indices: 17,41,65,89 -> -2.381, -2.559, -2.274, -2.345 -> \n        sum = -2.381 -2.559 = -4.94, -4.94 -2.274 = -7.214, -7.214 -2.345 = -9.559 -> avg = -9.559/4 = -2.38975\n\n     Hour 18 (18:00): \n        indices: 18,42,66,90 -> -2.416, -2.203, -2.416, -3.092 -> \n        sum = -2.416 -2.203 = -4.619, -4.619 -2.416 = -7.035, -7.035 -3.092 = -10.127 -> avg = -10.127/4 = -2.53175\n\n     Hour 19 (19:00): \n        indices: 19,43,67,91 -> -1.990, -2.061, -2.274, -2.239 -> \n        sum = -1.990 -2.061 = -4.051, -4.051 -2.274 = -6.325, -6.325 -2.239 = -8.564 -> avg = -8.564/4 = -2.141\n\n     Hour 20 (20:00): \n        indices: 20,44,68,92 -> -1.635, -1.670, -1.990, -2.061 -> \n        sum = -1.635 -1.670 = -3.305, -3.305 -1.990 = -5.295, -5.295 -2.061 = -7.356 -> avg = -7.356/4 = -1.839\n\n     Hour 21 (21:00): \n        indices: 21,45,69,93 -> -1.564, -1.954, -1.919, -2.061 -> \n        sum = -1.564 -1.954 = -3.518, -3.518 -1.919 = -5.437, -5.437 -2.061 = -7.498 -> avg = -7.498/4 = -1.8745\n\n     Hour 22 (22:00): \n        indices: 22,46,70,94 -> -1.990, -2.025, -2.061, -2.168 -> \n        sum = -1.990 -2.025 = -4.015, -4.015 -2.061 = -6.076, -6.076 -2.168 = -8.244 -> avg = -8.244/4 = -2.061\n\n     Hour 23 (23:00): \n        indices: 23,47,71,95 -> -2.274, -2.239, -2.452, -2.523 -> \n        sum = -2.274 -2.239 = -4.513, -4.513 -2.452 = -6.965, -6.965 -2.523 = -9.488 -> avg = -9.488/4 = -2.372\n\n 18.

Let's code the generation:\n\n     We have the 24 values for one day: \n        values = [\n            -2.523, -2.639, -2.728, -2.754, -2.825, -2.798, -2.790, -2.692, \n            -2.274, -2.346, -2.337, -2.247, -2.301, -2.079, -1.937, -2.043, \n            -2.185, -2.390, -2.532, -2.141, -1.839, -1.875, -2.061, -2.372\n        ]\n\n     Then we have 4 days: 2017-02-06, 2017-02-07, 2017-02-08, 2017-02-09.\n\n     We can do:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017,2,6)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # but note: we are adding day and then hour? Actually, we can do:\n                #   date = base_date + timedelta(days=day) + timedelta(hours=hour)\n                # But we can also do: base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour) is not allowed? \n                # Instead, we can do: base_date + timedelta(days=day) and then set the hour.\n\n        Alternatively, we can generate the 96 hours by:\n\n            start_date = datetime(2017,2,6,0,0,0)\n            for i in range(96):\n                current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n                value = values[i % 24]\n\n 31. We'll write the string representation of the date in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 32. We'll do:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0)\n        values = [ \n            -2.523, -2.639, -2.728, -2.754, -2.825, -2.798, -2.790, -2.692,\n            -2.274, -2.346, -2.337, -2.247, -2.301, -2.079, -1.937, -2.043,\n            -2.185, -2.390, -2.532, -2.141, -1.839, -1.875, -2.061, -2.372\n        ]\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            date_str = (start_date + timedelta(hours=i)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            value = values[i % 24]\n            # Format the value to have 3 decimal places\n            # But note: the value might be negative, and we want to show 3 decimals.\n            # We can format: f\"{value:.3f}\"\n            print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")\n\n 33. However, we are writing in the answer block.\n\n 34. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? We are not given any missing in the provided 96, and we are generating without missing.\n\n 35. We output the answer.\n\n 36. Let's write the answer block.\n",
