        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, we see peaks and troughs at similar times each day.\n 2. There are missing values in the provided data? Actually, the provided data for the past 96 dates (which is 4 days * 24 hours = 96) seems complete. But the problem says the data will have missing values. However, in the provided snippet, there are no missing values. So we assume that the provided 96 points are without missing values? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". Since the provided data does not have missing values, we proceed to forecast.\n\n Approach:\n Given the hourly data and the clear daily seasonality, we can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is multiple seasonal periods) and we are limited in the amount of data (only 4 days of history), we can use a simple seasonal model.\n\n One simple method is the seasonal naive method, where we forecast each hour by the same hour from the last available day. However, we have 4 days of history. We can also consider using the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that might be changing. Also, we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) into the future.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the exact time of the next 96 dates. We assume they are the next 96 hours starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n  - The last timestamp in the data is 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n  - The next 96 hours would be from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n How to handle the forecast?\n\n Since we have only 4 days of history, we can compute the average for each hour of the day (i.e., 0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values. However, in the provided data we don't have any. So we are going to assume that the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n 1. We will group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the day part).\n 2. For each hour (0 to 23), we compute the average of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n Example:\n   For hour 00:00:00, we have:\n        2017-05-17 00:00:00   4.488\n        2017-05-18 00:00:00   6.497\n        2017-05-19 00:00:00   7.837\n        2017-05-20 00:00:00   6.899\n\n   Average = (4.488 + 6.497 + 7.837 + 6.899) / 4 = 6.43025\n\n 3. Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign:\n        Day 1 (2017-05-21): \n            00:00:00 -> 6.43025\n        Similarly, for 01:00:00, we average the 01:00:00 values from the 4 days.\n\n 4. We do this for all 24 hours and then repeat the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the pattern might have a weekly component? But we only have 4 days (all in the same week? from Wednesday to Saturday). The next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Without more data (like multiple weeks) we cannot account for weekly seasonality. So we rely on the daily pattern.\n\n But wait: the problem says the dataset is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days? Actually, we are only given 4-day snippet. However, the instruction says we are to forecast based on the past 96 recorded dates (which is 4 days). So we must use only this data.\n\n Therefore, we will use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days as the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n However, let's check: the data shows a trend? For example, the values at 00:00:00: \n        2017-05-17: 4.488\n        2017-05-18: 6.497\n        2017-05-19: 7.837\n        2017-05-20: 6.899\n\n There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over these 4 days. So the average is reasonable.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  We'll create a list of the 96 historical values.\n\n  Then, we'll create 24 groups (for 0 to 23 hours). For each group, we compute the mean.\n\n  Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours), we assign:\n        Day 1: [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n        Day 2: [mean_0, mean_23] again\n        ... for 4 days.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are not given any in the history. So we proceed.\n\n  However, what if we had missing values? We would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we should handle missing values. Since we don't have any in the provided 96, we skip.\n\n  But to be safe, we can check for NaNs in the provided data? The provided data does not have any.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  1. Parse the given data string to extract the HUFL values. We have 96 values.\n\n  2. Group by hour index (0 to 95, then group by index % 24).\n\n  3. For each hour in 0..23, compute the average of the 4 values.\n\n  4. Then, for the next 96 hours, we create a list by repeating the 24 means 4 times.\n\n  5. Generate the dates: starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n  6. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,HUFL\n        2017-05-21 00:00:00,<value>\n        2017-05-21 01:00:00,<value>\n        ...\n        2017-05-24 23:00:00,<value>\n        </answer>\n\n  But note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's compute the means for each hour:\n\n  We'll create an array of 24 lists.\n\n  For i in range(0, 96):\n        hour_index = i % 24\n        value = historical_HUFL[i]\n        append value to the list for hour_index.\n\n  Then for each hour_index, compute the mean.\n\n Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n\n        values: [4.488, 6.497, 7.837, 6.899] -> mean = (4.488+6.497+7.837+6.899)/4 = 6.43025 -> 6.430\n\n Let's do one more: hour 1 (01:00:00):\n\n        values: [5.023, 5.090, 8.372, 7.636] -> (5.023+5.090+8.372+7.636)/4 = 6.53025 -> 6.530\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours will be:\n\n        [6.430, 6.530, ... (24 values) ] repeated 4 times.\n\n However, note: the pattern might not be exactly the same every day? But with only 4 days, we don't have a better method.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the last day (2017-05-20) as the forecast for the next day? But the problem says to use the past 96. Since we are to forecast 96, we have to forecast 4 days. The seasonal naive would use the same day of the previous period. But we don't have a full period beyond the 4 days? \n\n Given the data is very limited, the average by hour is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's compute the 24 means:\n\n We'll write a small code in our mind or with a calculator? Actually, we can do it step by step.\n\n But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data. So we have to output 96 forecasted values.\n\n We'll compute the 24 means:\n\n Hour 0: (4.00) [4.488, 6.497, 7.837, 6.899] -> 6.430\n Hour 1: [5.023, 5.090, 8.372, 7.636] -> (5.023+5.090=10.113; 8.372+7.636=16.008; total=26.121) -> 6.530\n Hour 2: [6.229, 4.823, 8.306, 7.770] -> (6.229+4.823=11.052; 8.306+7.770=16.076; total=27.128) -> 6.782\n Hour 3: [6.832, 5.425, 7.703, 8.573] -> (6.832+5.425=12.257; 7.703+8.573=16.276; total=28.533) -> 7.133\n Hour 4: [7.301, 5.827, 9.042, 5.827] -> (7.301+5.827=13.128; 9.042+5.827=14.869; total=27.997) -> 7.000 (rounded to 3 decimals: 6.999 -> 7.000?
