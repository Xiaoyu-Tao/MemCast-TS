        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar times each day) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast might need to account for the possibility of missing values in the future? \n    But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n    So we assume that the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we are to produce 96 points without any missing values.\n\n 3. We choose a method: \n    Since we have hourly data and clear daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality. \n    Given the small amount of data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use:\n    - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components (trend, seasonality, residual) but with only 4 days, trend might be hard to capture.\n    - Exponential Smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality, but ETS for hourly data with seasonality of 24 might be heavy and we have only 4 days (so 4 cycles).\n    - SARIMA: We can try a seasonal ARIMA model with seasonality of 24. However, with only 4 cycles, it might be challenging to fit.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be too simplistic and ignore any trend.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the small data, we can use a model that uses the last day and the same day of the week? But we only have 4 days (Tuesday to Friday). \n    We are forecasting the next 96 hours (which would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?).\n\n 6. Actually, let's check the dates:\n    - 2017-02-14 is a Tuesday.\n    - 2017-02-15: Wednesday.\n    - 2017-02-16: Thursday.\n    - 2017-02-17: Friday.\n    Then the next 96 hours would be:\n        Saturday 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to Tuesday 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n 7. Since we don't have data for Saturday, Sunday, Monday, we cannot use the same hour of the same day of the week. We have 4 days of data, but they are consecutive weekdays.\n\n 8. We can use a moving average method with seasonality of 24. For each hour in the day, we have 4 observations (from the 4 days). We can take the average of the same hour for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the pattern might change on weekends. But we don't have weekend data. So we have to rely on the available data.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the last available day (Friday) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous day? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n10. Given the constraints, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days. \n\n    For example, for hour 00:00: \n    values: 10.181, 9.042, 10.248, 12.324 -> average = (10.181+9.042+10.248+12.324)/4 = 10.44875\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we would have:\n        Day1 (Saturday): use the average for each hour of the day (from 00:00 to 23:00) \n        Day2 (Sunday): same as Day1? or we can use the average again? But we are forecasting 4 days, so we have 4 cycles.\n\n    Actually, we can use the same set of averages for each of the next 4 days? \n\n    However, note that the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (Friday) which is higher values than the previous days. \n    So we might want to account for an upward trend.\n\n11. We can compute the average for each hour and then adjust by a trend factor. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the last day has more weight? \n\n    Since we are not sure about the trend and we have very limited data, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour. \n\n    Steps for the forecast for hour h (where h in [0,23]) in the next 4 days:\n    Let h0, h1, h2, h3 be the values at hour h on day0 (2017-02-14), day1, day2, day3.\n    Then the forecast for hour h on day4, n=0 (the next day) is: (h0+h1+h2+h3)/4.\n\n    But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can safely average.\n\n    However, we are forecasting 4 days. We don't have any information about the weekend effect. So we will use the same average for each of the 4 days? \n\n    But that would be 4 identical days? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for the first day of the forecast (Saturday) and then for the next days, we can use the same pattern? \n\n    However, without any trend information, we cannot assume a change. \n\n    We decide to use the same 24-hour pattern (the average of the 4 days) for each of the next 4 days.\n\n12. But note: the last day (Friday) was higher than the previous days. So if we average, we are bringing down the Friday values. \n\n    Another approach: use the last day (Friday) as the base and then adjust by the average of the daily changes? \n\n    However, we are not sure. \n\n    Considering the instructions and the simplicity, we'll go with the average per hour for the next 4 days.\n\n13. How to compute:\n\n    We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the mean.\n\n    Then we repeat that same 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n14. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 00:00: [10.181, 9.042, 10.248, 12.324] -> (10.181+9.042+10.248+12.324)/4 = 41.795/4 = 10.44875\n    Hour 01:00: [9.645, 9.243, 10.717, 12.525] -> (9.645+9.243+10.717+12.525)/4 = 42.13/4 = 10.5325\n    ... and so on.\n\n    Then we create 4 days of data by repeating the same 24 averages.\n\n15. We generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-02-18 00:00:00.\n\n    The last given date is 2017-02-17 23:00:00. The next hour is 2017-02-18 00:00:00.\n\n    We need 96 hours: \n        2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n16. We'll compute the 24 averages and then assign them for each day in the forecast period.\n\n17. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are generating the forecast without missing values. \n\n    We are not given any missing values in the input, so we don't need to impute for the input. \n\n    For the forecast, we are to provide complete data.\n\n18. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list of 24 values (for 0 to 23 hours) by averaging the 4 days.\n\n    We have the data in order. We can reshape the 96 points into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n    Then take the mean for each column.\n\n19.
