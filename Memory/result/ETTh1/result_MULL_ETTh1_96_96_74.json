        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values. However, the provided sample does not have any missing values. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a pattern (with daily seasonality of 24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement for a complete output, we will use a simple but effective method: \n    Smoothing methods like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality) might be suitable.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has negative values and the pattern seems to have daily cycles (24 hours) and also some level of non-stationarity.\n\n 5. We can use the Seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (ETS). But since we are to provide a complete forecast without missing values, and the data is not too long, we can use ETS or a simple seasonal naive approach? \n\n 6. But the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a robust method. However, without the ability to run code, we have to rely on a heuristic.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or seasonal decomposition? But the requirement is to forecast 96 points.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, I will use a method that captures the seasonality and the recent trend. Since the data is only 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days, we can use:\n\n    - The last observed day (24 hours) as a base and adjust by the trend observed over the 4 days? \n\n 9. However, let me try to describe the pattern:\n\n    Looking at the data, each day seems to have a similar pattern: \n        - The values start around 0.2 to -0.6 at midnight, \n        - then they become more negative during the day (especially in the afternoon and evening), \n        - and then recover a bit at night.\n\n    But the overall trend from day to day is not clear. The first day (23rd) has a minimum around -2.274, the next day (24th) goes to -3.092, then the 25th has a minimum of -2.239, and the 26th has a minimum of -1.777. \n\n    So there might be a slight improvement (increasing trend) in the minimum values? But the maximum values also vary.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and without running an actual model, we can use a seasonal naive method: \n        forecast for the next day (24 hours) = the same as the previous day (24 hours) \n        but adjusted by the average change from one day to the next.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can compute the average of the last 4 days for each hour and use that as the forecast? \n\n 12. However, note that the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n 13. Let me compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days:\n\n     We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We can group by hour (0 to 23) and take the mean.\n\n     But note: the data starts at 2017-07-23? Actually, the data is from April.\n\n 14. Steps for averaging:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.213, -0.640, -0.604, 0.071) -> average = (0.213 -0.640 -0.604 +0.071)/4 = (-0.96)/4 = -0.24\n     Hour 1: (0.817, 0.000, -1.137, 0.142) -> (0.817+0-1.137+0.142)/4 = (-0.178)/4 = -0.0445\n\n     ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n 15. Then we use this average for each hour of the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day. However, we see a trend? \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last 4 days for each hour and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 17. Since the problem requires 96 points, we can generate 4 days of the same pattern? But that ignores any trend.\n\n 18. Considering the data shows a possible slight upward trend (the minimums are: -2.274, -3.092, -2.239, -1.777) which is not consistent. The maximums: 0.817, 0.000, 0.355, 0.533? Not clear.\n\n 19. Given the ambiguity, I must provide a method that is acceptable. I choose to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form the next 4 days. This is a simple seasonal average.\n\n 20. How to compute:\n\n     We have 4 days: day1 (23rd), day2 (24th), day3 (25th), day4 (26th)\n\n     For hour 0: (23rd:00: 0.213, 24th:00: -0.640, 25th:00: -0.604, 26th:00: 0.071) -> average = (0.213 -0.640 -0.604 +0.071)/4 = (-0.96)/4 = -0.24\n\n     For hour 1: (0.817, 0.000, -1.137, 0.142) -> (0.817+0-1.137+0.142) = (0.817+0.142 = 0.959; 0.959 -1.137 = -0.178) -> -0.178/4 = -0.0445\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 21. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (27th, 28th, 29th, 30th) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 22. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not encountered in the given 96, so we use the given 96.\n\n 23. However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. \n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the last day (26th) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? \n\n 25. But the problem requires 96 points, and we must provide the complete data.\n\n 26. I will compute the average for each hour and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 27. Let me compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.213, -0.640, -0.604, 0.071) -> (-0.96)/4 = -0.24\n     Hour 1: (0.817, 0.000, -1.137, 0.142) -> (0.817+0-1.137+0.142) = -0.178 -> -0.0445\n     Hour 2: (0.107, -0.249, -0.355, 0.071) -> (0.107-0.249-0.355+0.071) = -0.426 -> -0.1065\n     Hour 3: (0.284, -0.853, -1.706, 0.036) -> (0.284-0.853-1.706+0.036) = -2.239 -> -0.55975\n     Hour 4: (0.391, -0.569, -1.315, 0.178) -> (0.391-0.569-1.315+0.178) = -1.315 -> -0.32875\n     Hour 5: (-0.178, -0.604, -0.640, 0.533) -> (-0.178-0.604-0.640+0.533) = -0.889 -> -0.22225\n     Hour 6: (-0.782, -0.782, -0.711, -0.107) -> (-0.782-0.782-0.711-0.107) = -2.382 -> -0.5955\n     Hour 7: (0.249, -1.137, -0.320, -0.213) -> (0.249-1.137-0.320-0.213) = -1.421 -> -0.35525\n     Hour 8: (-0.320, -1.635, -1.315, 0.355) -> (-0.320-1.635-1.315+0.355) = -2.915 -> -0.72875\n     Hour 9: (-0.249, -0.640, -1.564, 0.000) -> (-0.249-0.640-1.564+0) = -2.453 -> -0.61325\n     Hour 10: (-0.462, -0.320, -1.137, -0.249) -> (-0.462-0.320-1.137-0.249) = -2.168 -> -0.542\n     Hour 11: (-0.213, -0.426, -1.706, -0.142) -> (-0.213-0.426-1.706-0.142) = -2.487 -> -0.62175\n     Hour 12: (-1.102, -1.066, -2.061, -1.670) -> (-1.102-1.066-2.061-1.670) = -5.899 -> -1.47475\n     Hour 13: (-0.995, -1.208, -2.452, -0.284) -> (-0.995-1.208-2.452-0.284) = -4.939 -> -1.23475\n     Hour 14: (-0.462, -0.497, -1.244, -1.244) -> (-0.462-0.497-1.244-1.244) = -3.447 -> -0.86175\n     Hour 15: (-1.492, -1.883, -1.635, -0.604) -> (-1.492-1.883-1.635-0.604) = -5.614 -> -1.4035\n     Hour 16: (-1.528, -1.386, -1.173, -0.746) -> (-1.528-1.386-1.173-0.746) = -4.833 -> -1.20825\n     Hour 17: (-1.883, -1.386, -1.635, 0.355) -> (-1.883-1.386-1.635+0.355) = -4.549 -> -1.13725\n     Hour 18: (-2.061, -1.848, -2.168, -2.168) -> (-2.061-1.848-2.168-2.168) = -8.245 -> -2.06125\n     Hour 19: (-2.274, -1.706, -2.239, -1.635) -> (-2.274-1.706-2.239-1.635) = -7.854 -> -1.9635\n     Hour 20: (-2.274, -1.848, -1.990, -1.670) -> (-2.274-1.848-1.990-1.670) = -7.782 -> -1.9455\n     Hour 21: (-1.990, -3.092, -1.492, -1.777) -> (-1.990-3.092-1.492-1.777) = -8.351 -> -2.08775\n     Hour 22: (-2.452, -1.954, -1.386, -1.777) -> (-2.452-1.954-1.386-1.777) = -7.569 -> -1.89225\n     Hour 23: (-0.284, -2.097, -0.391, -0.604) -> (-0.284-2.097-0.391-0.604) = -3.376 -> -0.844\n\n 28. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00) will be:\n\n     2017-04-27 00:00:00: -0.24\n     2017-04-27 01:00:00: -0.0445\n     ... and so on for 24 hours, then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n 29. But note: the dates must be generated correctly. The last given date is 2017-04-26 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-04-27 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-30 23:00:00.\n\n 30. However, this method does not account for any trend and might be too simplistic. But with limited data and without running a model, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 31. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 32. Let me write the first day of forecast (2017-04-27) with the 24 averages:\n\n        date                  MULL\n        2017-04-27 00:00:00  -0.24000\n        2017-04-27 01:00:00  -0.04450\n        2017-04-27 02:00:00  -0.10650\n        2017-04-27 03:00:00  -0.55975\n        2017-04-27 04:00:00  -0.32875\n        2017-04-27 05:00:00  -0.22225\n        2017-04-27 06:00:00  -0.59550\n        2017-04-27 07:00:00  -0.35525\n        2017-04-27 08:00:00  -0.72875\n        2017-04-27 09:00:00  -0.61325\n        2017-04-27 10:00:00  -0.54200\n        2017-04-27 11:00:00  -0.62175\n        2017-04-27 12:00:00  -1.47475\n        2017-04-27 13:00:00  -1.23475\n        2017-04-27 14:00:00  -0.86175\n        2017-04-27 15:00:00  -1.40350\n        2017-04-27 16:00:00  -1.20825\n        2017-04-27 17:00:00  -1.13725\n        2017-04-27 18:00:00  -2.06125\n        2017-04-27 19:00:00  -1.96350\n        2017-04-27 20:00:00  -1.94550\n        2017-04-27 21:00:00  -2.08775\n        2017-04-27 22:00:00  -1.89225\n        2017-04-27 23:00:00  -0.84400\n\n     Then the next day (2017-04-28) will be the same 24 numbers? \n\n 33. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not using any model that requires imputation because we are using the average of the available days. Since we have 4 days for each hour, we have used all.\n\n 34. However, if we had missing values in the input, we would have to impute them. But the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 35. Therefore, we output 4 days of the same 24 numbers.\n\n 36. We must format the answer exactly as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate, MULL\n2017-04-27 00:00:00, [value]\n...\n2017-04-30 23:00:00, [value]\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 37. But note: the example input had a space after the date and then the value. However, the example output format in the problem uses a comma? Actually, the input was:\n\n        \"2017-04-23 00:00:00  0.213\"\n\n     with a space. But the problem says to follow the format. The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n     And the example input did not use a comma. So we can use the same: two spaces? or tab? The input seems to have variable spaces. But to be safe, we can use a fixed format: \n\n        YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  value\n\n     with one space.\n\n 38. However, the problem says: \"final answer must follow the format\" and they showed:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n     and in the example input, they used:\n\n        \"2017-04-23 00:00:00  0.213\"\n\n     So we use the same: a space between the date and the value.\n\n 39. We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n 40. Let me write the first 24 hours (for 2017-04-27) with the computed averages (rounded to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places). \n\n     We computed:\n\n        Hour0: -0.24 -> -0.240\n        Hour1: -0.0445 -> -0.0445 -> but we can round to 3 decimals? Let's keep as computed? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n     We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Hour0: -0.240\n        Hour1: -0.0445 -> -0.045 (if rounded to 3 decimals) but let's do:\n\n        Actually, the input had up to 3 decimals. We can round to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Hour0: -0.240\n        Hour1: -0.0445 -> -0.044 (if we round to 3 decimals, we can do: round(x, 3))\n\n        But note: -0.0445 rounded to 3 decimals is -0.044? Actually, rounding: \n            -0.0445: \n                The fourth decimal is 5 -> so we round up the third decimal: 4 becomes 5? \n                But negative? \n\n        Actually, in Python: \n            round(-0.0445, 3) -> -0.044\n            because it rounds to the nearest even? \n\n        However, we can do: \n            -0.0445: \n                absolute: 0.0445 -> round to 3 decimals: 0.044 (since 0.45e-3, the next digit is 5, but then we look at the next? Actually, standard rounding: 0.0445 * 1000 = 44.5 -> round to integer: 44 (if round half to even) -> 0.044.\n\n        But the input has values like -0.102, so 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Let me recalc and round:\n\n        Hour0: -0.24 -> -0.240\n        Hour1: -0.0445 -> -0.044 (if we round to 3 decimals, we get -0.044) but wait: \n            -0.0445 is between -0.044 and -0.045. Rounding to 3 decimals: \n                The number is -0.0445, the digit in the 4th decimal is 5, so we round away from zero? \n                Actually, the rule is: round half to even? \n                The exact midpoint: 0.0445 -> 0.044 (because 44 is even) or 0.045? \n                Actually, 0.0445 * 1000 = 44.5 -> round to even: 44 is even? 44.5 is halfway, so we round to the nearest even: 44 is even -> so 44. So 0.044.\n\n                But for negative: same? \n                -0.0445: the absolute rounding is 0.0445 -> 0.044, then negative: -0.044.\n\n        So we'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Alternatively, to be consistent, we can use the exact value and then format to 3 decimals.\n\n        But the problem: the input had 3 decimals? Actually, the input had:\n\n            0.213, 0.817, 0.107, ... -0.178, ... \n\n        So we output 3 decimals.\n\n 41. Recompute the averages and round to 3 decimals:\n\n        Hour0: (0.213 -0.640 -0.604 +0.071)/4 = (-0.96)/4 = -0.240 -> -0.240\n        Hour1: (0.817+0-1.137+0.142)/4 = (-0.178)/4 = -0.0445 -> round(-0.0445, 3) = -0.044\n        But let me check: \n            -0.0445: \n                The third decimal is 4, the fourth is 5 -> so we round the third decimal from 4 to 5? \n                Actually, no: the rule is to look at the next digit. If it's 5, then we round to the nearest even for the last digit. \n                The last digit is 4 (which is even) and we are adding 0.001? \n                Actually, the rounding rule: \n                    if the digit to be rounded is followed by 5, and there are no digits, or only zeros, then we round to the nearest even.\n\n                Here, we have -0.0445: \n                    The digit in the thousandths place is 4, and the next is 5 -> so we round the 4 to the nearest even? \n                    Actually, we look at the digit in the thousandths place: 4, and the next is 5, so we round the 4 up to 5? \n                    But the rule for 5 is to round to the nearest even digit for the last place. \n                    The last place we are keeping is the thousandths. The digit in the thousandths is 4 (even) and the next is 5, so we leave it even? \n                    Actually, the rule: \n                        Round 0.0445 to 3 decimals: \n                            0.0445 * 1000 = 44.5 -> round to integer: 44 (because 44 is even) or 45? \n                        The rule: round half to even: 44.5 -> 44 (since 44 is even) -> so 0.044.\n\n                Therefore, -0.0445 -> -0.044.\n\n        Hour2: (0.107-0.249-0.355+0.071) = (-0.426)/4 = -0.1065 -> round to 3 decimals: \n                -0.1065: \n                    The thousandths digit is 6, and the next is 5 -> so we round the 6 to 7? \n                    But wait: 0.1065: \n                        0.5 -> 106.5 -> round to integer: 106 (even) or 107? \n                        The rule: round half to even: 106.5 -> 106 is even? 106 is even -> so 106? \n                    Actually, 106.5 is halfway between 106 and 107. The even number between 106 and 107 is 106? \n                    But 106 is even, 107 is odd -> so we round to 106? \n                    Then 0.1065 -> 0.106? \n                    But that doesn't seem right because 0.1065 is closer to 0.107? \n\n                Actually, the rule: \n                    The number is 0.1065. \n                    The digit in the thousandths place is 6, and the next is 5 -> we add 1 to the 6? \n                    But the rule of half: we round to the nearest even. \n                    The last digit we are keeping is the thousandths. We are at 0.106, and we want to decide whether to leave it 6 or round to 7? \n                    The next digit is 5, so we look at the thousandths digit: 6 is even? -> then we leave it? \n                    Actually, the rule is applied to the digit that is being rounded (the hundredths? no). \n\n                Let me break down: \n                    0.1065: \n                        The digits: \n                            1 (tenths) -> 0\n                            0 (hundredths) -> 0\n                            6 (thousandths) -> 6\n                            5 (ten thousandths) -> We are rounding to thousandths, so we look at the ten thousandths: 5 -> so we round the thousandths digit. \n                    The thousandths digit is 6, which is even -> so we leave it? \n                    But the rule: round half to even: \n                        We round to the nearest even number in the final position. \n                        The number 0.1065 is exactly halfway between 0.106 and 0.107? \n                        Actually, 0.1065 is 106.5 * 10^-3. \n                        The two options: 0.106 and 0.107. \n                        Which is even? We are at the thousandths place: 6 and 7. 6 is even, 7 is odd. \n                        So we choose 0.106? \n\n                Therefore, -0.1065 -> -0.106\n\n        However, I think I'm overcomplicating. In practice, we can use:\n\n            value = round(avg, 3)\n\n        and let the rounding function do it.\n\n        But since we are doing by hand, we'll do:\n\n            Hour0: -0.240\n            Hour1: -0.0445 -> -0.044\n            because: \n                abs: 0.0445 -> the third decimal is 4, the next is 5 -> so we round to 0.044 -> then negative: -0.044.\n\n            Hour2: -0.1065 -> \n                abs: 0.1065 -> the third decimal is 6, the next is 5 -> so we round the 6 to 7? \n                Actually, the rule: \n                    if the digit to be rounded is followed by 5, then we round to the nearest even for the last digit. \n                    The last digit we are keeping is the thousandths. The thousandths digit is 6 (even) and the next is 5 -> we leave it? \n                    But that doesn't make sense. \n\n                Actually, the rule is: \n                    \"Round half to even\" is applied to the entire number. \n                    For 0.1065: \n                        We are rounding to 3 decimal places: \n                        Look at the fourth decimal: 5 -> so we round the third decimal. \n                        The third decimal is 6, which is even -> so we leave it? \n                    But that would be 0.106? \n\n                However, in practice, in Python:\n\n                    >>> round(0.1065, 3)\n                    0.106\n                    >>> round(-0.1065, 3)\n                    -0.106\n\n                So we do -0.106.\n\n        So we'll do:\n\n            Hour0: -0.240\n            Hour1: -0.044\n            Hour2: -0.106\n            Hour3: -0.560   # because -0.55975 -> round: 0.560 (but negative: -0.560) -> wait: \n                -0.55975: \n                    abs: 0.55975 -> rounding to 3 decimals: \n                        0.55975: the third decimal is 9, the next is 7 -> which is >=5, so we round up the 9 -> 0. So 0.560 -> -0.560\n\n            Hour4: -0.329   # -0.32875 -> round: 0.329 -> -0.329? \n                0.32875: the third decimal is 8, the next is 7 -> so we round up the 8 -> 0.329 -> -0.329\n\n            Hour5: -0.222   # -0.22225 -> round: 0.222 -> -0.222? \n                0.22225: the third decimal is 2, the next is 2 -> which is <5 -> so 0.222 -> -0.222\n\n            Hour6: -0.596   # -0.5955 -> 0.5955: third decimal 5, next 5 -> round the 5: \n                0.5955: the third decimal is 5, the next is 5 -> we look at the next? \n                Actually, we only have 4 decimals? \n                The number is 0.5955 -> rounding to 3 decimals: \n                    the fourth decimal is 5 -> so we round the third decimal (5) to the nearest even? \n                    The third decimal is 5, which is odd -> so we round up? \n                    But the rule: \n                        The two options: 0.595 and 0.596. \n                        The even one? 5 is odd, 6 is even -> so 0.596.\n\n                So -0.596.\n\n            Hour7: -0.355   # -0.35525 -> 0.35525: third decimal 5, next 2 -> so we leave? -> 0.355 -> -0.355\n\n            Hour8: -0.729   # -0.72875: 0.72875 -> third decimal 8, next 7 -> round up: 0.729 -> -0.729\n\n            Hour9: -0.613   # -0.61325: 0.61325 -> third decimal 3, next 2 -> leave -> 0.613 -> -0.613\n\n            Hour10: -0.542   # -0.542: already 3 decimals -> -0.542\n\n            Hour11: -0.622   # -0.62175: 0.62175 -> third decimal 1, next 7 -> round up: 0.622 -> -0.622\n\n            Hour12: -1.475   # -1.47475: 1.47475 -> third decimal 4, next 7 -> round up: 1.475 -> -1.475\n\n            Hour13: -1.235   # -1.23475: 1.23475 -> third decimal 4, next 7 -> round up: 1.235 -> -1.235\n\n            Hour14: -0.862   # -0.86175: 0.86175 -> third decimal 1, next 7 -> round up: 0.862 -> -0.862\n\n            Hour15: -1.404   # -1.4035: 1.4035 -> third decimal 3, next 5 -> round to even: 3 is odd -> round up? \n                    But 1.4035: \n                        The third decimal is 3, the next is 5 -> we round the 3 to 4? \n                    So 1.404 -> -1.404\n\n            Hour16: -1.208   # -1.20825: 1.20825 -> third decimal 8, next 2 -> leave -> 1.208 -> -1.208\n\n            Hour17: -1.137   # -1.13725: 1.13725 -> third decimal 7, next 2 -> leave? \n                    Actually, 1.13725: \n                        third decimal is 7, next is 2 -> so we leave? \n                    But wait: we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n                        1.13725: the fourth decimal is 2 -> so we leave the third decimal as 7 -> 1.137 -> -1.137\n\n            Hour18: -2.061   # -2.06125: 2.06125 -> third decimal 1, next 2 -> leave -> 2.061 -> -2.061\n\n            Hour19: -1.964   # -1.9635: 1.9635 -> third decimal 3, next 5 -> round to even: 3 is odd -> round up to 4 -> 1.964 -> -1.964\n\n            Hour20: -1.946   # -1.9455: 1.9455 -> third decimal 5, next 5 -> round to even: 5 is odd -> round up to 6 -> 1.946 -> -1.946\n\n            Hour21: -2.088   # -2.08775: 2.08775 -> third decimal 7, next 7 -> round up: 2.088 -> -2.088\n\n            Hour22: -1.892   # -1.89225: 1.89225 -> third decimal 2, next 2 -> leave -> 1.892 -> -1.892\n\n            Hour23: -0.844   # -0.844: already 3 decimals? -0.844\n\n 42.
