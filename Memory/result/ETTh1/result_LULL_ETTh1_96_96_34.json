        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour seasonality). We can observe that the load is generally lower during the night and higher during the day, but note that the values are negative and positive. However, the pattern is not consistent in the given 4 days? Let's check:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-11-14): \n        Starts negative, becomes less negative (towards zero) in the morning (around 8-9 AM) and then becomes negative again at night.\n\n   Day 2 (2016-11-15): \n        Starts negative, then becomes positive during the day (from 9 AM to 5 PM) and then becomes positive but decreasing at night.\n\n   Day 3 (2016-11-16): \n        Positive in the early hours, then becomes positive during the day and then decreases at night.\n\n   Day 4 (2016-11-17): \n        Positive in the early hours, then positive during the day and then decreases at night.\n\n 2. However, note that the data is called \"Low UseLess Load\", and the values are mostly negative in the first day and then become positive. This might indicate a change in the pattern? But we are only 4 days.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours), we can use a simple seasonal method.\n\n 4. Since we have 24-hour seasonality, we can compute the average pattern for the 4 days we have, and then use that to forecast the next 4 days? But note: the pattern changes over the days? \n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality. However, with only 4 days, we cannot have a long seasonal period.\n\n 6. Another approach: use the last day (2016-11-17) as the base and adjust with the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the fact that the data is very short, we can use the following:\n\n    - We'll take the last 24 hours (2016-11-17) and use that as the pattern for the next day? But the pattern might be similar to the previous days.\n\n    - However, looking at the data, the pattern of the first day (2016-11-14) is different (all negative) and the next three days are positive. So we might consider the last three days as more representative.\n\n 8. We can compute the average of the last three days for each hour of the day (i.e., average of 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00 for the three days: 2016-11-15, 2016-11-16, 2016-11-17) and use that as the forecast for the next four days? But note: we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). So we can repeat the same pattern for 4 days.\n\n 9. However, we must account for any trend? The data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. We can check:\n\n        Day1: average = mean of 24 negative and positive? Actually, the first day is mostly negative and the next three are positive. So we cannot simply average the first day.\n\n 10. Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any missing? So we can proceed.\n\n 11. Approach:\n\n        We will use the last three days (2016-11-15, 2016-11-16, 2016-11-17) to compute the hourly average.\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23), we compute:\n            avg_hour_0 = (value at 00:00 on 15th + 16th + 17th) / 3\n            ... and so on.\n\n        Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days: 2016-11-18 to 2016-11-21), we assign:\n            Day1 (2016-11-18): [avg_hour_0, avg_hour_1, ... avg_hour_23]\n            Day2 (2016-11-19): same as above\n            Day3 (2016-11-20): same\n            Day4 (2016-11-21): same\n\n 12. Why not use the last four days? Because the first day (2016-11-14) is different (negative values) and the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", so maybe the first day is an anomaly? Or it might be that the transformer was in a low load state? But the next three days are positive. Since we are forecasting the immediate next days, we assume the pattern of the last three days is more relevant.\n\n 13. Let's compute the hourly averages for the last three days:\n\n        Hour 00:00: (2016-11-15: -0.487, 2016-11-16: 0.426, 2016-11-17: 1.005) -> (-0.487+0.426+1.005)/3 = (0.944)/3 = 0.3147\n        But wait, the first day (2016-11-15) at 00:00 is -0.487? Actually, the data for 2016-11-15 00:00:00 is -0.487? \n        Let me check:\n\n            2016-11-15 00:00:00 -0.487\n            2016-11-16 00:00:00  0.426\n            2016-11-17 00:00:00  1.005\n\n        So average = (-0.487 + 0.426 + 1.005) / 3 = (0.944) / 3 = 0.314666... \u2248 0.315\n\n        Similarly, for 01:00:\n            2016-11-15 01:00:00 -0.579\n            2016-11-16 01:00:00  0.335\n            2016-11-17 01:00:00  1.066\n            average = (-0.579 + 0.335 + 1.066) / 3 = (0.822) / 3 = 0.274\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 14. However, note that the data for the same hour on different days might have a lot of variation. We are taking a simple average.\n\n 15. We'll generate the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 16. We must round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 17. Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to write the output.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated method? But with only 4 days, it's hard. We can try to use a seasonal naive method: using the last day (2016-11-17) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have to do for 4 days? \n\n        That would be: \n            2016-11-18: same as 2016-11-17\n            2016-11-19: same as 2016-11-17\n            ... \n\n        But that ignores any trend and also the fact that the previous days are different.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the data, I choose the average of the last three days for each hour.\n\n 20. Let me compute the hourly averages:\n\n        Hour 00: (-0.487 + 0.426 + 1.005) / 3 = 0.944/3 = 0.3147 -> 0.315\n        Hour 01: (-0.579 + 0.335 + 1.066) / 3 = 0.822/3 = 0.274\n        Hour 02: (-0.640 + 0.457 + 1.097) / 3 = 0.914/3 = 0.3047 -> 0.305\n        Hour 03: (-0.579 + 0.426 + 1.066) / 3 = 0.913/3 = 0.3043 -> 0.304\n        Hour 04: (-0.609 + 0.487 + 1.279) / 3 = 1.157/3 = 0.3857 -> 0.386\n        Hour 05: (-0.579 + 0.457 + 1.127) / 3 = 1.005/3 = 0.335\n        Hour 06: (-0.457 + 0.457 + 1.066) / 3 = 1.066/3 = 0.3553 -> 0.355\n        Hour 07: (-0.396 + 0.579 + 1.127) / 3 = 1.310/3 = 0.4367 -> 0.437\n        Hour 08: (-0.457 + 0.883 + 1.097) / 3 = 1.523/3 = 0.5077 -> 0.508\n        Hour 09: (1.066 + 1.066 + 0.883) / 3 = 3.015/3 = 1.005\n        Hour 10: (0.914 + 1.157 + 0.944) / 3 = 3.015/3 = 1.005\n        Hour 11: (1.097 + 1.066 + 0.975) / 3 = 3.138/3 = 1.046\n        Hour 12: (0.761 + 0.822 + 0.731) / 3 = 2.314/3 = 0.7713 -> 0.771\n        Hour 13: (1.005 + 1.036 + 0.761) / 3 = 2.802/3 = 0.934\n        Hour 14: (1.097 + 0.731 + 0.853) / 3 = 2.681/3 = 0.8937 -> 0.894\n        Hour 15: (1.218 + 0.792 + 1.036) / 3 = 3.046/3 = 1.0153 -> 1.015\n        Hour 16: (1.188 + 0.761 + 0.761) / 3 = 2.710/3 = 0.9033 -> 0.903\n        Hour 17: (0.822 + 0.853 + 0.640) / 3 = 2.315/3 = 0.7717 -> 0.772\n        Hour 18: (0.701 + 0.670 + 0.579) / 3 = 1.950/3 = 0.650\n        Hour 19: (0.579 + 0.518 + 0.457) / 3 = 1.554/3 = 0.518\n        Hour 20: (0.548 + 0.518 + 0.457) / 3 = 1.523/3 = 0.5077 -> 0.508\n        Hour 21: (0.518 + 0.518 + 0.457) / 3 = 1.493/3 = 0.4977 -> 0.498\n        Hour 22: (0.457 + 0.396 + 0.366) / 3 = 1.219/3 = 0.4063 -> 0.406\n        Hour 23: (0.518 + 0.487 + 0.305) / 3 = 1.310/3 = 0.4367 -> 0.437\n\n 21. Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-18 23:00:00: [0.315, 0.274, 0.305, 0.304, 0.386, 0.335, 0.355, 0.437, 0.508, 1.005, 1.005, 1.046, 0.771, 0.934, 0.894, 1.015, 0.903, 0.772, 0.650, 0.518, 0.508, 0.498, 0.406, 0.437]\n\n        Day 2: 2016-11-19: same 24 numbers.\n\n        Day 3: 2016-11-20: same.\n\n        Day 4: 2016-11-21: same.\n\n 22. But note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\". We must generate the next 96 hours starting from 2016-11-18 00:00:00.\n\n        The last given date is 2016-11-17 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-11-18 00:00:00\n2016-11-18 01:00:00\n...\n2016-11-18 23:00:00\n2016-11-19 00:00:00\n...\n2016-11-21 23:00:00\n\n 23. We write the data in the same format: two columns: date and LULL.\n\n 24. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 25. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.315\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00 0.274\n        2016-11-18 02:00:00 0.305\n        2016-11-18 03:00:00 0.304\n        2016-11-18 04:00:00 0.386\n        ... and so on.\n\n 26. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-18 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n 28. We'll repeat the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 29. However, note: the computed averages are for the last three days, but we are using 3 decimal places. We must round to 3 decimals.\n\n 30. Let me recheck the computed averages:\n\n        Hour 00: 0.314666... -> 0.315\n        Hour 01: 0.274 -> 0.274\n        Hour 02: 0.304666... -> 0.305\n        Hour 03: 0.304333... -> 0.304\n        Hour 04: 0.385666... -> 0.386\n        Hour 05: 0.335 -> 0.335\n        Hour 06: 0.355333... -> 0.355\n        Hour 07: 0.436666... -> 0.437\n        Hour 08: 0.507666... -> 0.508\n        Hour 09: 1.005 -> 1.005\n        Hour 10: 1.005 -> 1.005\n        Hour 11: 1.046 -> 1.046\n        Hour 12: 0.771333... -> 0.771\n        Hour 13: 0.934 -> 0.934\n        Hour 14: 0.893666... -> 0.894\n        Hour 15: 1.015333... -> 1.015\n        Hour 16: 0.903333... -> 0.903\n        Hour 17: 0.771666... -> 0.772\n        Hour 18: 0.650 -> 0.650\n        Hour 19: 0.518 -> 0.518\n        Hour 20: 0.507666... -> 0.508\n        Hour 21: 0.497666... -> 0.498\n        Hour 22: 0.406333... -> 0.406\n        Hour 23: 0.436666... -> 0.437\n\n 31. Now, we write the data accordingly.\n\n 32. We output in the required format.\n\n 33. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.315\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00 0.274\n        ... (96 lines)\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n 34. Let's generate the dates and the values.\n\n 35. We'll write the data in the same format as the input: two columns separated by space, with the date string and the LULL value (with 3 decimal places).\n\n 36. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        base_date = '2016-11-18'\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2016-11-{18+day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                # But note: 18,19,20,21 -> so 18,19,20,21\n\n        However, we must be careful: November has 30 days, so 18,19,20,21 are all valid.\n\n 37. We'll create a list of the 24 values for one day (the average we computed) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 38. The list of values for one day (in order from 00 to 23):\n\n        values = [\n            0.315, 0.274, 0.305, 0.304, 0.386, 0.335, 0.355, 0.437, 0.508, 1.005, 1.005, 1.046,\n            0.771, 0.934, 0.894, 1.015, 0.903, 0.772, 0.650, 0.518, 0.508, 0.498, 0.406, 0.437\n        ]\n\n 39. Then for each day from 2016-11-18 to 2016-11-21, we assign these 24 values.\n\n 40. Write the output.\n\n 41. Let me write the first day:\n\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.315\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00 0.274\n        2016-11-18 02:00:00 0.305\n        2016-11-18 03:00:00 0.304\n        2016-11-18 04:00:00 0.386\n        2016-11-18 05:00:00 0.335\n        2016-11-18 06:00:00 0.355\n        2016-11-18 07:00:00 0.437\n        2016-11-18 08:00:00 0.508\n        2016-11-18 09:00:00 1.005\n        2016-11-18 10:00:00 1.005\n        2016-11-18 11:00:00 1.046\n        2016-11-18 12:00:00 0.771\n        2016-11-18 13:00:00 0.934\n        2016-11-18 14:00:00 0.894\n        2016-11-18 15:00:00 1.015\n        2016-11-18 16:00:00 0.903\n        2016-11-18 17:00:00 0.772\n        2016-11-18 18:00:00 0.650\n        2016-11-18 19:00:00 0.518\n        2016-11-18 20:00:00 0.508\n        2016-11-18 21:00:00 0.498\n        2016-11-18 22:00:00 0.406\n        2016-11-18 23:00:00 0.437\n\n        Then the next day (2016-11-19) same values.\n\n 42.
