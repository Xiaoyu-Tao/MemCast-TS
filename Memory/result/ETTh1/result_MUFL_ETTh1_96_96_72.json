        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days) of Middle UseFul Load (MUFL) from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). The pattern: \n    - Positive values during the night and early morning (00:00 to 07:00) but with a dip at 07:00? \n    - Then a drop to negative values during the day (from 08:00 to 16:00) and then rising again in the evening.\n\n 2. However, we are also told that there might be missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? \n    We have 24*4 = 96 points. So we have a complete block.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and the data has a daily seasonality, we can use a seasonal method.\n\n 4. Given the complexity and the requirement for a complete answer without omission, we can use a simple seasonal naive approach: \n    using the last available day (2017-04-18) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But note: the pattern might change slightly.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use the average of the four days for each hour? But let's look at the data:\n\n    We have 4 days. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (from Saturday to Tuesday? Let's check: 2017-04-15 is a Saturday, 16 Sunday, 17 Monday, 18 Tuesday). \n    We don't have enough to capture weekly seasonality. So we stick to daily.\n\n 7. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll group by the hour (ignoring the day) and take the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n 8. But note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the four days, the values at the same hour do not show a clear trend. \n    For example, at 00:00: \n        2017-04-15: 8.422\n        2017-04-16: 9.097\n        2017-04-17: 7.676\n        2017-04-18: 9.808\n    The average: (8.422+9.097+7.676+9.808)/4 = 8.75075\n\n 9. We'll do this for every hour (0 to 23) to get 24 average values.\n\n10. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this average pattern 4 times.\n\n11. However, note that the problem says there might be missing values. But in the provided data, we don't have any. \n    So we can proceed with the average.\n\n12. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (8.422 + 9.097 + 7.676 + 9.808) / 4 = 8.75075\n    Hour 1: (8.244 + 8.884 + 9.559 + 8.671) / 4 = 8.8395\n    Hour  and so on.\n\n13. But note: the data has 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimals as in the input.\n\n14. Alternatively, we can use a more robust method? But the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide a complete forecast.\n\n15. Since we are an expert, we might consider using a time series model like SARIMA or exponential smoothing with seasonality. \n    However, without the ability to run code and with the requirement to provide a complete set of 96 numbers, we choose the simple average method.\n\n16. Steps for the average method:\n    - Extract the hour from the timestamp.\n    - Group by hour and compute the mean of the 4 days.\n\n17. We'll compute the 24 hourly means and then repeat them 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n18. The forecast dates will be from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n19.

Now, we have 24 hourly averages.

We'll write the dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n    Start: 2017-04-19 00:00:00\n    End: 2017-04-22 23:00:00\n\n22.

However, note: the problem says there are missing values in the data? But we are not given any in the input. \n    We are only forecasting the next 96 points.
