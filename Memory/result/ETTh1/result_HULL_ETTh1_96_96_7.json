        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 3. We must choose a method for time series forecasting. Given the data, we can try:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) if seasonality exists.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) if there is trend and seasonality.\n    - Given the data is at hourly level, we might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly pattern is not visible.\n\n 4. Let's observe the data:\n    - The data for 2016-07-31 is constant (3.617 for all 24 hours). This might be an anomaly or missing data? But it is provided as is.\n    - The other days show variation.\n\n 5. Since we have only 4 days, it's challenging to capture weekly seasonality. We might consider daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 6. We can use a model that can handle seasonality. Given the short history, we might use a simple seasonal decomposition or a model like SARIMA.\n\n 7. However, note that the data on 2016-07-31 is constant. This might be an issue. We might treat it as an outlier or use it as is.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can use:\n    - SARIMA with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24)\n\n 9. Steps for modeling:\n    a. Check stationarity: We might need to difference the series to make it stationary (if non-stationary).\n    b. Identify orders: We can use auto_arima to help, but we are not coding, so we have to use a reasonable model.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method if we are limited by the data. Since the data is short, we can use:\n     - Naive seasonal forecast: use the last day (2016-08-01) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But note that 2016-08-01 is a Monday? and the next days are Tuesday to Friday? We don't have enough to capture weekly pattern.\n\n 11. However, the problem does not specify the day of the week for the future, but we know:\n     2016-07-29: Friday\n     2016-07-30: Saturday\n     2016-07-31: Sunday\n     2016-08-01: Monday\n     Then the next 96 hours (4 days) are:\n        2016-08-02: Tuesday\n        2016-08-03: Wednesday\n        2016-08-04: Thursday\n        2016-08-05: Friday\n\n 12. We might try to capture the daily cycle by averaging the non-anomalous days? But the Sunday (2016-07-31) is constant and might be an anomaly. So we can use Friday (2016-07-29), Saturday (2016-07-30), and Monday (2016-08-01) to form a daily profile? But note that Monday might be different from Friday and Saturday.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we can use a simple approach: \n     - Use the last day (Monday, 2016-08-01) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 copies of 2016-08-01? However, the next 4 days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. They might have different patterns.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the average of the available days (excluding the constant Sunday) for the same hour. But we only have:\n        Friday (2016-07-29): 1\n        Saturday (2016-07-30): day2\n        Monday (2016-08-01): day4 (note: Sunday is day3, which we might exclude)\n\n     Then for each hour of the day (0 to 23) we can average the values from Friday, Saturday, and Monday? But that would be 3 values per hour.\n\n 15. However, the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing. So we can use the available data.\n\n 16. Let's form an average daily profile from the non-constant days (excluding 2016-07-31). Then we use that profile for each of the next 4 days? But note: the next 4 days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. We don't have a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in the history. So we use the average of the available days as a typical day? \n\n 17. Steps for average profile:\n     - For hour 0: (4.153 (Fri) + 3.684 (Sat) + 3.818 (Mon)) / 3 = (4.153+3.684+3.818)/3 = 11.655/3 = 3.885\n     - Similarly for each hour.\n\n 18. But note: the constant day (Sunday) might be an anomaly and we are excluding it.\n\n 19. However, the next days are not weekend? We have Tuesday to Friday. We don't have a Tuesday in the history. So we are using a generic daily profile.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Monday) and adjust it by the difference between Monday and the average? But that might be overcomplicating.\n\n 21. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have limited data, we will generate the next 96 points by repeating the average daily profile for 4 days.\n\n 22. How to compute the average daily profile?\n     We have:\n        Day1: 2016-07-29 (Friday) - 24 hours\n        Day2: 2016-07-30 (Saturday) - 24 hours\n        Day3: 2016-07-31 (Sunday) - constant, we skip\n        Day4: 2016-08-01 (Monday) - 24 hours\n\n     We compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of the same hour from Day1, Day2, and Day4.\n\n 23. But note: the data for 2016-08-01 has 24 hours? Yes, from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n 24. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (4.153, 3.684, 3.818) -> (4.153+3.684+3.818)/3 = 3.885\n     Hour 1: (3.148, 3.684, 3.952) -> (3.148+3.684+3.952)/3 = 3.5947\n     ... and so on.\n\n 25. Then we repeat this profile for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 26. However, note that the next 4 days are Tuesday (2016-08-02), Wednesday (2016-08-03), Thursday (2016-08-04), Friday (2016-08-05). We are using an average that includes Friday, Saturday, and Monday. This might not be ideal, but it's the best we can do with the data.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we could use the Monday (2016-08-01) as the base and then adjust by the average daily profile? But we don't have a baseline for Tuesday.\n\n 28. Given the time and simplicity, we'll go with the average daily profile repeated 4 times.\n\n 29. Steps to compute the average for each hour (0-23) from the three days (Fri, Sat, Mon) excluding Sunday.\n\n 30. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (4.153 + 3.684 + 3.818) / 3 = 3.885\n        hour1: (3.148 + 3.684 + 3.952) / 3 = (3.148+3.684=6.832; 6.832+3.952=10.784; 10.784/3=3.594666... -> 3.595)\n        hour2: (3.617 + 2.545 + 2.545) / 3 = (3.617+2.545=6.162; 6.162+2.545=8.707; 8.707/3=2.902333... -> 2.902)\n        hour3: (3.081 + 2.076 + 2.813) / 3 = (3.081+2.076=5.157; 5.157+2.813=7.97; 7.97/3=2.656666... -> 2.657)\n        hour4: (2.947 + 3.014 + 1.541) / 3 = (2.947+3.014=5.961; 5.961+1.541=7.502; 7.502/3=2.500666... -> 2.501)\n        hour5: (2.344 + 2.545 + 2.478) / 3 = (2.344+2.545=4.889; 4.889+2.478=7.367; 7.367/3=2.455666... -> 2.456)\n        hour6: (2.612 + 2.344 + 3.215) / 3 = (2.612+2.344=4.956; 4.956+3.215=8.171; 8.171/3=2.723666... -> 2.724)\n        hour7: (3.215 + 4.421 + 5.157) / 3 = (3.215+4.421=7.636; 7.636+5.157=12.793; 12.793/3=4.264333... -> 4.264)\n        hour8: (2.813 + 4.086 + 3.751) / 3 = (2.813+4.086=6.899; 6.899+3.751=10.65; 10.65/3=3.55)\n        hour9: (3.416 + 2.746 + 2.143) / 3 = (3.416+2.746=6.162; 6.162+2.143=8.305; 8.305/3=2.768333... -> 2.768)\n        hour10: (2.947 + 3.617 + 2.813) / 3 = (2.947+3.617=6.564; 6.564+2.813=9.377; 9.377/3=3.125666... -> 3.126)\n        hour11: (2.947 + 3.550 + 2.746) / 3 = (2.947+3.550=6.497; 6.497+2.746=9.243; 9.243/3=3.081)\n        hour12: (2.880 + 3.282 + 2.344) / 3 = (2.880+3.282=6.162; 6.162+2.344=8.506; 8.506/3=2.835333... -> 2.835)\n        hour13: (2.478 + 2.746 + 2.813) / 3 = (2.478+2.746=5.224; 5.224+2.813=8.037; 8.037/3=2.679)\n        hour14: (2.545 + 3.550 + 3.215) / 3 = (2.545+3.550=6.095; 6.095+3.215=9.31; 9.31/3=3.103333... -> 3.103)\n        hour15: (2.478 + 2.679 + 2.143) / 3 = (2.478+2.679=5.157; 5.157+2.143=7.3; 7.3/3=2.433333... -> 2.433)\n        hour16: (3.148 + 2.880 + 2.277) / 3 = (3.148+2.880=6.028; 6.028+2.277=8.305; 8.305/3=2.768333... -> 2.768)\n        hour17: (3.081 + 2.344 + 2.411) / 3 = (3.081+2.344=5.425; 5.425+2.411=7.836; 7.836/3=2.612)\n        hour18: (2.210 + 2.210 + 1.474) / 3 = (2.210+2.210=4.42; 4.42+1.474=5.894; 5.894/3=1.964666... -> 1.965)\n        hour19: (2.411 + 2.009 + 1.674) / 3 = (2.411+2.009=4.42; 4.42+1.674=6.094; 6.094/3=2.031333... -> 2.031)\n        hour20: (1.674 + 1.072 + 1.273) / 3 = (1.674+1.072=2.746; 2.746+1.273=4.019; 4.019/3=1.339666... -> 1.340)\n        hour21: (1.139 + 0.201 + 1.541) / 3 = (1.139+0.201=1.34; 1.34+1.541=2.881; 2.881/3=0.960333... -> 0.960)\n        hour22: (2.947 + 3.282 + 1.674) / 3 = (2.947+3.282=6.229; 6.229+1.674=7.903; 7.903/3=2.634333... -> 2.634)\n        hour23: (2.813 + 3.684 + 3.885) / 3 = (2.813+3.684=6.497; 6.497+3.885=10.382; 10.382/3=3.460666... -> 3.461)\n\n 31. Now, we have a daily profile of 24 hours. We will use this profile for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 32. The next 96 hours start at 2016-08-02 00:00:00 and end at 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n\n 33. We'll generate:\n\n        Day1: 2016-08-02 (Tuesday): \n            00:00:00 -> 3.885\n            01:00:00 -> 3.595\n            02:00:00 -> 2.902\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 3.461\n\n        Day2: 2016-08-03 (Wednesday): same profile\n        Day3: 2016-08-04 (Thursday): same profile\n        Day4: 2016-08-05 (Friday): same profile\n\n 34. We output the data in the same format: two columns: date and HULL.\n\n 35. We must generate the dates: \n        Start: 2016-08-02 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-08-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n\n 36. We'll write the data in the next 96 rows.\n\n 37. Note: We are rounding the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 38. However, note that the input has some values with 3 decimal places, so we'll round to 3.\n\n 39. Let's write the data:\n\n    2016-08-02 00:00:00,3.885\n    2016-08-02 01:00:00,3.595\n    2016-08-02 02:00:00,2.902\n    2016-08-02 03:00:00,2.657\n    2016-08-02 04:00:00,2.501\n    2016-08-02 05:00:00,2.456\n    2016-08-02 06:00:00,2.724\n    2016-08-02 07:00:00,4.264\n    2016-08-02 08:00:00,3.550\n    2016-08-02 09:00:00,2.768\n    2016-08-02 10:00:00,3.126\n    2016-08-02 11:00:00,3.081\n    2016-08-02 12:00:00,2.835\n    2016-08-02 13:00:00,2.679\n    2016-08-02 14:00:00,3.103\n    2016-08-02 15:00:00,2.433\n    2016-08-02 16:00:00,2.768\n    2016-08-02 17:00:00,2.612\n    2016-08-02 18:00:00,1.965\n    2016-08-02 19:00:00,2.031\n    2016-08-02 20:00:00,1.340\n    2016-08-02 21:00:00,0.960\n    2016-08-02 22:00:00,2.634\n    2016-08-02 23:00:00,3.461\n\n    Then repeat the same profile for the next day (2016-08-03) and so on.\n\n 40. We'll generate 4 days of 24 hours each.\n\n 41. We must be cautious: the last day of the provided data is 2016-08-01 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-08-02 00:00:00.\n\n 42. We'll write the data in the next 96 lines.\n\n 43. Since the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast, we are not missing any.\n\n 44. We output in the required format.\n\n 45. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 46. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2016-08-02 00:00:00,3.885\n        2016-08-02 01:00:00,3.595\n        ... (96 lines)\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n 47. We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n 48. We note that the average profile we computed is:\n\n        hour0: 3.885\n        hour1: 3.595\n        hour2: 2.902\n        hour3: 2.657\n        hour4: 2.501\n        hour5: 2.456\n        hour6: 2.724\n        hour7: 4.264\n        hour8: 3.550\n        hour9: 2.768\n        hour10: 3.126\n        hour11: 3.081\n        hour12: 2.835\n        hour13: 2.679\n        hour14: 3.103\n        hour15: 2.433\n        hour16: 2.768\n        hour17: 2.612\n        hour18: 1.965\n        hour19: 2.031\n        hour20: 1.340\n        hour21: 0.960\n        hour22: 2.634\n        hour23: 3.461\n\n 49.
