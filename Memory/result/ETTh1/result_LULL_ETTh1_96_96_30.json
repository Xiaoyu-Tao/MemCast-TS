        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the data has missing value warning. But in the provided data, we don't see missing values in the given 96 points? \n Since the problem states that the data will have missing values, we must be cautious. But the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. We must choose a model. Given the hourly data and the apparent daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours), we can use a seasonal model.\n 3. We can use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or other methods. However, with only 96 points, we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n But note: the data for 2016-10-31 is constant at -0.548. This might be an anomaly or missing data? However, the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided segment we don't have any explicit missing (NaN) but we have a constant which might be an indicator of missing data treatment? \n\n However, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any NaN. So we proceed with the given data.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data is small and we need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality (if we can set seasonality to 24)\n   - SARIMA: we can try to fit a model with seasonal period 24.\n\n However, note that the data has a clear daily cycle (24 hours). \n\n But the data only has 4 days? Actually, 4 days? Let's see: \n   From 2016-10-29 to 2016-11-01: 4 days? Actually 4 days? \n   10-29, 10-30, 10-31, 11-01 -> 4 days, 24*4=96 points.\n\n So we have exactly 4 days of hourly data.\n\n Given the limited data, we can try to use a simple model that can capture seasonality.\n\n We choose to use a seasonal naive method? Or we can use an automated model.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, and we have 4 days, we can use the last day (2016-11-01) as a pattern for the next days? \n But note: the data on 2016-10-31 is constant, which is unusual. So we might not want to use that day as a pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the non-constant days? \n\n However, we are to use a proper forecasting method.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use a simple method: \n   - We will use the average of the first three days (excluding the constant day? but 10-31 is constant) and then adjust by the last day?\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a robust method.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an automated forecasting model like Prophet or ETS. But we are not running code, we have to reason.\n\n Since we cannot run code, we have to rely on a simple method that can be done by reasoning.\n\n Steps for simple forecasting:\n\n 1. We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We have 4 days, but the third day (2016-10-31) is constant and might be an anomaly.\n\n 2. We can use the average of the first two days (2016-10-29 and 2016-10-30) and the last day (2016-11-01) to form a typical day? But note: 2016-11-01 is a Wednesday? and 2016-10-29 is Saturday, 2016-10-30 is Sunday. So the pattern might differ by day of week.\n\n 3. However, we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only one week? and the next 4 days are from Wednesday to Saturday?).\n\n 4. Given the complexity, we can use the following:\n\n    - We remove the constant day (2016-10-31) and then use the remaining 3 days to form a pattern? But 3 days are not aligned: Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday (since 2016-11-31 is missing? Actually, 2016-10-31 is Monday and 2016-11-01 is Tuesday).\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-01) as the pattern for the next days? But the next days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday? and 2016-11-01 is Tuesday.\n\n 6. We can also note that the data on 2016-11-01 is similar to the previous Saturday and Sunday? \n\n Let me compare:\n\n   Saturday (2016-10-29) and Sunday (2016-10-30) and Tuesday (2016-11-01) have similar patterns? \n\n   We can take the average of the three days? But they are different days of the week.\n\n 7. Given the ambiguity, and the fact that we are to forecast 96 points, we can do:\n\n    - Use the average of the three non-constant days (2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, 2016-11-01) for each hour of the day to form a typical day, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the next 4 days are: 2016-11-02 (Wednesday), 2016-11-03 (Thursday), 2016-11-04 (Friday), 2016-11-05 (Saturday).\n\n    We have one Saturday in our history (2016-10-29) and Sunday (2016-10-30) and Tuesday (2016-11-01). \n\n    We don't have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Tuesday) as the pattern for Wednesday? and then adjust by the difference between consecutive days? But we don't have data.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the three available days (excluding the constant day) for each hour. Then we use that average pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n\n   - For each hour (0 to 23), we average the values from 2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, and 2016-11-01.\n\n   - But note: 2016-10-31 is constant and we skip it.\n\n   - Then we create a typical day of 24 hours.\n\n   - Then we repeat this typical day for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 10. However, we must account for the fact that the next days include a Saturday (2016-11-05). We have a Saturday in our history (2016-10-29). But we are using an average of Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday? which might not be representative for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n 11. But without more data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 12. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: \n        2016-10-29: -0.518\n        2016-10-30: -1.005\n        2016-11-01: -1.157\n        average = (-0.518 -1.005 -1.157)/3 = -0.893333\n\n     Hour 1:\n        2016-10-29: -0.579\n        2016-10-30: -1.097\n        2016-11-01: -1.157\n        average = (-0.579 -1.097 -1.157)/3 = -0.944333\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 13. But note: the data for 2016-10-29 is Saturday, 2016-10-30 is Sunday, 2016-11-01 is Tuesday. We are missing Monday (which was constant) and then we are about to forecast Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n     We have a Saturday in the history and we are forecasting a Saturday? So for Saturday (the last day of the forecast) we might use the Saturday pattern? But we don't have enough Saturdays to isolate.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we stick to the average.\n\n 15. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then we repeat that pattern 4 times.\n\n 16. However, note that the data on 2016-10-31 (Monday) was constant. We don't know why. It might be a holiday? or missing data? But we are told to be aware of missing values, but we are not given any instruction on how they were treated. We ignore that day.\n\n 17. We will create a list of 24 averages.\n\n 18. Then we generate the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 19. The forecasted dates will be from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We must be:\n\n        date, LULL\n        2016-11-02 00:00:00, [average for hour0]\n        2016-11-02 01:00:00, [average for hour1]\n        ...\n        2016-11-02 23:00:00, [average for hour23]\n        2016-11-03 00:00:00, [average for hour0]\n        ... and so on.\n\n 21. We must calculate the 24 averages.\n\n Let's do the calculations:\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00): \n        (-0.518 + (-1.005) + (-1.157)) / 3 = (-2.68) / 3 = -0.893333\n\n    Hour 1 (01:00):\n        (-0.579 + (-1.097) + (-1.157)) / 3 = (-2.833) / 3 = -0.944333\n\n    Hour 2 (02:00):\n        (-0.609 + (-1.097) + (-1.188)) / 3 = (-2.894) / 3 = -0.964667\n\n    Hour 3 (03:00):\n        (-0.579 + (-1.127) + (-1.188)) / 3 = (-2.894) / 3 = -0.964667\n\n    Hour 4 (04:00):\n        (-0.579 + (-1.127) + (-1.097)) / 3 = (-2.803) / 3 = -0.934333\n\n    Hour 5 (05:00):\n        (-0.548 + (-1.127) + (-1.157)) / 3 = (-2.832) / 3 = -0.944\n\n    Hour 6 (06:00):\n        (-0.487 + (-1.097) + (-1.127)) / 3 = (-2.711) / 3 = -0.903667\n\n    Hour 7 (07:00):\n        (-0.457 + (-0.853) + (-0.975)) / 3 = (-2.285) / 3 = -0.761667\n\n    Hour 8 (08:00):\n        (-0.487 + (-0.609) + (-0.701)) / 3 = (-1.797) / 3 = -0.599\n\n    Hour 9 (09:00):\n        (-0.487 + (-0.457) + (-0.579)) / 3 = (-1.523) / 3 = -0.507667\n\n    Hour 10 (10:00):\n        (-0.548 + (-0.487) + (-0.518)) / 3 = (-1.553) / 3 = -0.517667\n\n    Hour 11 (11:00):\n        (-0.701 + (-0.609) + (-0.518)) / 3 = (-1.828) / 3 = -0.609333\n\n    Hour 12 (12:00):\n        (-0.822 + (-0.731) + (-0.731)) / 3 = (-2.284) / 3 = -0.761333\n\n    Hour 13 (13:00):\n        (-0.731 + (-0.731) + (-0.701)) / 3 = (-2.163) / 3 = -0.721\n\n    Hour 14 (14:00):\n        (-0.701 + (-0.731) + (-0.731)) / 3 = (-2.163) / 3 = -0.721\n\n    Hour 15 (15:00):\n        (-0.822 + (-0.640) + (-0.822)) / 3 = (-2.284) / 3 = -0.761333\n\n    Hour 16 (16:00):\n        (-0.761 + (-0.701) + (-0.853)) / 3 = (-2.315) / 3 = -0.771667\n\n    Hour 17 (17:00):\n        (-0.883 + (-0.914) + (-0.914)) / 3 = (-2.711) / 3 = -0.903667\n\n    Hour 18 (18:00):\n        (-0.975 + (-1.097) + (-0.975)) / 3 = (-3.047) / 3 = -1.015667\n\n    Hour 19 (19:00):\n        (-0.944 + (-1.097) + (-1.066)) / 3 = (-3.107) / 3 = -1.035667\n\n    Hour 20 (20:00):\n        (-0.883 + (-1.066) + (-0.975)) / 3 = (-2.924) / 3 = -0.974667\n\n    Hour 21 (21:00):\n        (-1.005 + (-1.157) + (-1.005)) / 3 = (-3.167) / 3 = -1.055667\n\n    Hour 22 (22:00):\n        (-1.066 + (-1.127) + (-1.066)) / 3 = (-3.259) / 3 = -1.086333\n\n    Hour 23 (23:00):\n        (-0.914 + (-1.036) + (-0.853)) / 3 = (-2.803) / 3 = -0.934333\n\n 22. Now we round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n    Hour0: -0.893\n    Hour1: -0.944\n    Hour2: -0.965\n    Hour3: -0.965\n    Hour4: -0.934\n    Hour5: -0.944\n    Hour6: -0.904\n    Hour7: -0.762\n    Hour8: -0.599\n    Hour9: -0.508\n    Hour10: -0.518\n    Hour11: -0.609\n    Hour12: -0.761\n    Hour13: -0.721\n    Hour14: -0.721\n    Hour15: -0.761\n    Hour16: -0.772\n    Hour17: -0.904\n    Hour18: -1.016\n    Hour19: -1.036\n    Hour20: -0.975\n    Hour21: -1.056\n    Hour22: -1.086\n    Hour23: -0.934\n\n 23. Then we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n 24. The dates:\n\n      Day1: 2016-11-02 (Wednesday) -> hours: 00:00 to 23:00: use the 24 values above.\n      Day2: 2016-11-03 (Thursday): same 24 values.\n      Day3: 2016-11-04 (Friday): same 24 values.\n      Day4: 2016-11-05 (Saturday): same 24 values.\n\n 25. We write the data in the required output format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points we didn't have any. And we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n We output the next 96 points.\n\n Let's write the data:\n\n   2016-11-02 00:00:00, -0.893\n   2016-11-02 01:00:00, -0.944\n   2016-11-02 02:00:00, -0.965\n   2016-11-02 03:00:00, -0.965\n   2016-11-02 04:00:00, -0.934\n   2016-11-02 05:00:00, -0.944\n   2016-11-02 06:00:00, -0.904\n   2016-11-02 07:00:00, -0.762\n   2016-11-02 08:00:00, -0.599\n   2016-11-02 09:00:00, -0.508\n   2016-11-02 10:00:00, -0.518\n   2016-11-02 11:00:00, -0.609\n   2016-11-02 12:00:00, -0.761\n   2016-11-02 13:00:00, -0.721\n   2016-11-02 14:00:00, -0.721\n   2016-11-02 15:00:00, -0.761\n   2016-11-02 16:00:00, -0.772\n   2016-11-02 17:00:00, -0.904\n   2016-11-02 18:00:00, -1.016\n   2016-11-02 19:00:00, -1.036\n   2016-11-02 20:00:00, -0.975\n   2016-11-02 21:00:00, -1.056\n   2016-11-02 22:00:00, -1.086\n   2016-11-02 23:00:00, -0.934\n\n   Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 26. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
