        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for forecasting, we must handle the provided data and then produce 96 future points.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days), we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality (24-hour pattern).\n\n 3. We are to output the next 96 timestamps and their forecasted MULL values.\n\n 4. We must account for the possibility of missing values in the input? But the provided input does not have any. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", \n    meaning the entire dataset (which we are not given beyond the 96 points) might. But for the purpose of forecasting the next 96 points, we are only given 96 points without gaps.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a model that handles seasonality. Since we are limited by the data (only 4 days of history) and the seasonality is daily (24 points per cycle), we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days?\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n    However, note that the data does not show a clear pattern over the days? Let's look at the data:\n\n    Day 1 (09-11): \n        00:00: 3.518, 01:00: 2.985, ... 23:00: 3.198\n    Day 2 (09-12):\n        00:00: 3.660, ... 23:00: 2.772\n    Day 3 (09-13):\n        00:00: 2.310, ... 23:00: 3.802\n    Day 4 (09-14):\n        00:00: 4.371, ... 23:00: 3.376\n\n    We can see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. But we have only 4 days, so we can try to capture the average daily pattern.\n\n 6. We'll use a simple method: for each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note: the next 96 hours are 4 days. So we can repeat the daily pattern 4 times.\n\n    But what if there is a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a trend beyond 4 days. Alternatively, we can use the last day (or the average of the last two days) to forecast the next day? \n    But the problem says we must forecast 96 points.\n\n 7. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we'll compute the hourly average for the 24 hours over the 4 days and then for the next 4 days, we repeat the same daily pattern.\n\n    Steps for the method:\n        - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    However, note: the data might have a downward or upward trend? But with 4 days, it's hard to tell. We can also consider using a moving average to smooth the data and then use the last cycle plus the average daily pattern? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average daily pattern without any trend adjustment.\n\n 8. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (3.518 + 3.660 + 2.310 + 4.371) / 4 = (3.859) -> 3.859\n        hour1: (2.985 + 3.767 + 2.097 + 4.548) / 4 = (3.34925) -> 3.349\n        ... and so on.\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be:\n\n        Day5 (2016-09-15): hour0: 3.859, hour1: 3.349, ... hour23: (average of the 23rd hour of the 4 days)\n        Day6: same as Day5 pattern\n        Day7: same\n        Day8: same\n\n 9. But note: the last provided day is 2016-09-14. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00\n\n 10. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, we cannot capture a weekly pattern or a long-term trend. \n\n 11. Another approach: use a linear model with time and dummy variables for hours? But that would require 24 dummy variables and we have only 96 points. It might overfit.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, the average method is simple and often used for seasonal naive forecasting.\n\n 13. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values.\n\n        hour0: [3.518, 3.660, 2.310, 4.371] -> mean = (3.518+3.660+2.310+4.371)/4 = 13.859/4 = 3.46475\n        hour1: [2.985, 3.767, 2.097, 4.548] -> (2.985+3.767+2.097+4.548)/4 = 13.397/4 = 3.34925\n        hour2: [3.482, 3.909, 2.594, 2.914] -> (3.482+3.909+2.594+2.914)/4 = 12.899/4 = 3.22475\n        hour3: [2.985, 3.411, 2.736, 3.625] -> (2.985+3.411+2.736+3.625)/4 = 12.757/4 = 3.18925\n        hour4: [4.158, 3.660, 2.701, 2.772] -> (4.158+3.660+2.701+2.772)/4 = 13.291/4 = 3.32275\n        hour5: [2.523, 3.305, 2.239, 2.949] -> (2.523+3.305+2.239+2.949)/4 = 11.016/4 = 2.754\n        hour6: [2.701, 2.985, 2.203, 3.127] -> (2.701+2.985+2.203+3.127)/4 = 11.016/4 = 2.754\n        hour7: [2.736, 3.340, 2.736, 4.584] -> (2.736+3.340+2.736+4.584)/4 = 13.396/4 = 3.349\n        hour8: [2.914, 3.411, 3.980, 4.051] -> (2.914+3.411+3.980+4.051)/4 = 14.356/4 = 3.589\n        hour9: [3.944, 2.523, 3.553, 3.909] -> (3.944+2.523+3.553+3.909)/4 = 13.929/4 = 3.48225\n        hour10: [2.665, 2.416, 3.589, 3.518] -> (2.665+2.416+3.589+3.518)/4 = 12.188/4 = 3.047\n        hour11: [2.416, 2.736, 2.736, 2.985] -> (2.416+2.736+2.736+2.985)/4 = 10.873/4 = 2.71825\n        hour12: [2.203, 2.239, 2.381, 1.670] -> (2.203+2.239+2.381+1.670)/4 = 8.493/4 = 2.12325\n        hour13: [2.487, 2.381, 2.025, 1.812] -> (2.487+2.381+2.025+1.812)/4 = 8.705/4 = 2.17625\n        hour14: [2.985, 2.239, 2.416, 2.132] -> (2.985+2.239+2.416+2.132)/4 = 9.772/4 = 2.443\n        hour15: [1.990, 2.843, 2.878, 2.452] -> (1.990+2.843+2.878+2.452)/4 = 10.163/4 = 2.54075\n        hour16: [1.492, 2.523, 2.985, 2.310] -> (1.492+2.523+2.985+2.310)/4 = 9.310/4 = 2.3275\n        hour17: [2.381, 2.630, 2.523, 2.025] -> (2.381+2.630+2.523+2.025)/4 = 9.559/4 = 2.38975\n        hour18: [2.310, 2.274, 2.487, 2.061] -> (2.310+2.274+2.487+2.061)/4 = 9.132/4 = 2.283\n        hour19: [2.061, 2.025, 2.381, 2.061] -> (2.061+2.025+2.381+2.061)/4 = 8.528/4 = 2.132\n        hour20: [2.097, 2.061, 2.274, 1.777] -> (2.097+2.061+2.274+1.777)/4 = 8.209/4 = 2.05225\n        hour21: [1.564, 0.782, 2.168, 2.310] -> (1.564+0.782+2.168+2.310)/4 = 6.824/4 = 1.706\n        hour22: [1.812, 2.345, 2.665, 3.447] -> (1.812+2.345+2.665+3.447)/4 = 10.269/4 = 2.56725\n        hour23: [3.198, 2.772, 3.802, 3.376] -> (3.198+2.772+3.802+3.376)/4 = 13.148/4 = 3.287\n\n 14. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-09-15): \n            00:00:00 -> 3.46475\n            01:00:00 -> 3.34925\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 3.287\n\n        Day2 (2016-09-16): same as Day1 pattern? \n            But note: we are using the same daily pattern for each day.\n\n        However, we must generate 96 points. So we repeat the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 15. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not given any in the input, but for the forecast we are to output 96 points without missing.\n\n 16. Format the output: We must output the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted MULL value.\n\n        The last timestamp in the input is 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n        The next timestamp is 2016-09-15 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n 17. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-09-18 23:00:00\n\n        That's 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n 18. We'll assign the hourly averages in order for each day.\n\n 19. However, note: the average for each hour of the day is fixed. So:\n\n        hour0: 3.46475 for 2016-09-15 00:00:00, 2016-09-16 00:00:00, 2016-09-17 00:00:00, 2016-09-18 00:00:00\n        hour1: 3.34925 for 2016-09-15 01:00:00, ... and so on.\n\n 20. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places. So we round to 3.\n\n        But note: the average we computed might have more. We'll round to 3.\n\n 21. Let's compute the rounded averages:\n\n        hour0: 3.465\n        hour1: 3.349\n        hour2: 3.225\n        hour3: 3.189\n        hour4: 3.323\n        hour5: 2.754\n        hour6: 2.754\n        hour7: 3.349\n        hour8: 3.589\n        hour9: 3.482\n        hour10: 3.047\n        hour11: 2.718\n        hour12: 2.123\n        hour13: 2.176\n        hour14: 2.443\n        hour15: 2.541\n        hour16: 2.328\n        hour17: 2.390\n        hour18: 2.283\n        hour19: 2.132\n        hour20: 2.052\n        hour21: 1.706\n        hour22: 2.567\n        hour23: 3.287\n\n 22. Now, we'll generate the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-15 00:00:00 -> 3.465\n               2016-09-15 01:00:00 -> 3.349\n               ... \n               2016-09-15 23:00:00 -> 3.287\n\n        Day2: 2016-09-16 00:00:00 -> 3.465\n               2016-09-16 01:00:00 -> 3.349\n               ...\n\n        and so on for 4 days.\n\n 23. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 24. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n        [timestamp1] [value1]\n        [timestamp2] [value2]\n        ...\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 25. We generate the timestamps and the corresponding forecasted MULL.\n\n 26. Code for generating the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until we have 96 records.\n\n 27. We'll create a list:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2016-09-15 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 28. And the values: we repeat the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n        values = [3.465, 3.349, 3.225, 3.189, 3.323, 2.754, 2.754, 3.349, 3.589, 3.482, 3.047, 2.718, \n                  2.123, 2.176, 2.443, 2.541, 2.328, 2.390, 2.283, 2.132, 2.052, 1.706, 2.567, 3.287]\n\n        Then for 4 days: values * 4 (but as a cycle)\n\n 29. We output each line: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS MULL_value\" (with the value rounded to 3 decimals as above)\n\n 30. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 3.465\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00 3.349\n        2016-09-15 02:00:00 3.225\n        ...\n\n 31. We note: the input data had the MULL values as floats with 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. We output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 33. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 34.
