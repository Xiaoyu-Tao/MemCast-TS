        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for the purpose of forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 2. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly (168 hours) but we only have 4 days so weekly might not be captured.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality. Given the data length is short (only 96 points), we might use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality\n    - Or a simple model like Prophet by Facebook, which can handle multiple seasonality and missing data, but we don't have missing data in the provided part.\n\n 4. However, note that the problem says the data will have missing values. But the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 5. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points, we must generate 96 timestamps and corresponding OT values.\n\n 6. We must be cautious: the data shows a clear daily pattern (temperature rises during the day and falls at night) and also some non-stationarity.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we choose to use a model that can capture seasonality and trends. We'll use SARIMA.\n\n 8. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - Check stationarity: if not stationary, difference (d) and seasonal difference (D) might be needed.\n    - We have seasonality of 24 (hourly data, daily cycle).\n\n 9. We can try: SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[24]. But with only 4 days of data, we must keep the order low.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like a seasonal naive or average, but we want to capture the trend and seasonality.\n\n 11. Given the complexity and the data size, we can use auto_arima from pmdarima to select the best parameters.\n\n However, since we are in a simulated environment and cannot run code, we have to rely on a pre-defined method.\n\n 12. We note that the temperature has:\n     - A daily cycle: high during the day (especially afternoon) and low at night.\n     - The level of the same hour of the day might be increasing or decreasing due to external factors (like load, weather) but we don't have that.\n\n 13. We can also consider that the next 4 days might follow a similar pattern to the last 4 days, but with a possible trend.\n\n 14. Given the above, we can do:\n\n     Option 1: Use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n     But note: we only have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour for the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n     However, we see that the temperature on 2017-06-21 is a bit different from 2017-06-18? Let's check:\n\n        Day1 (2017-06-18): min ~15.05, max ~21.17\n        Day2 (2017-06-19: min ~16.74, max ~20.47\n        Day3:2017-06-20: min ~18.00, max ~22.93\n        Day4:2017-06-21: min ~17.65, max ~21.73\n\n     There is a slight upward trend? But then on day4 it went down a bit.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and without running actual code, we decide to use a simple method:\n\n     We compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n     But we also note that there might be a trend. We can compute the overall level for each day (by averaging the day) and then adjust the hourly average by the change in the daily level.\n\n     However, for simplicity and since we don't have more data, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n 16. Steps for the simple method:\n\n     - Group the data by hour (0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n     - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for that hour.\n\n 17. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-06-21. The next day is 2017-06-22, then 23, 24, 25.\n\n 18. We create the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-06-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n 19. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (16.532 + 16.743 + 18.22 + 20.049) / 4 = (16.532+16.743=33.275; 33.275+18.22=51.495; 51.495+20.049=71.544) /4 = 17.886\n        hour1: (16.18 + 16.883 + 18.079 + 20.541) /4 = (16.18+16.883=33.063; 33.063+18.079=51.142; 51.142+20.541=71.683) /4 = 17.92075\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. However, we must note that the data might have a trend and the last day might be more important. We could use a weighted average? But without more information, we use simple average.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-06-21) as the base and then adjust by the average hourly pattern? But that might not capture the multi-day average.\n\n 22. Considering the instructions and the need for a complete answer, we will compute the average for each hour and then assign that for the next 4 days.\n\n 23. We must be cautious: the data has 4-day pattern? Actually, we are using the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 24. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We have 4 days, each with 24 hours -> 4 values per hour.\n\n        We'll create a list of 24 averages.\n\n 25. We compute:\n\n        hour0: [16.532, 16.743, 18.22, 20.049] -> mean = (16.532+16.743+18.22+20.049)/4 = 17.886\n        hour1: [16.18, 16.883, 18.079, 20.541] -> (16.18+16.883+18.079+20.541)/4 = 17.92075 -> rounded to 17.921\n        ... \n\n 26. But note: the original data has 3 decimal places? Actually, it has up to 3 decimal places but we see 16.532000 -> so we can keep 3 decimals.\n\n 27. We'll compute each hour and then assign for the next 4 days.\n\n 28. However, we must note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have weekly data. So we ignore.\n\n 29. We'll generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-06-22 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> average of hour0 = 17.886\n               2017-06-22 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> average of hour1 = 17.921\n               ... until hour23.\n\n        Day2: 2017-06-23 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 17.886\n               ...\n\n        Day3: 2017-06-24 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 17.886\n        Day4: 2017-06-25 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 17.886\n\n 30. But wait, this method ignores any trend. We see that the last day (2017-06-21) had an hour0 value of 20.049 which is higher than the first day (16.532). \n     So the average 17.886 is lower than the last day's hour0. This might be a problem.\n\n 31. Alternative: we can use the average of the last two days? or use exponential smoothing? \n\n 32. Given the ambiguity, and since we are not running code, we decide to use the 4-day average for each hour.\n\n 33. We compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (16.532 + 16.743 + 18.22 + 20.049) / 4 = 17.886\n        hour1: (16.18 + 16.883 + 18.079 + 20.541) / 4 = 17.92075 -> 17.921\n        hour2: (15.969 + 17.024 + 18.009 + 19.627) / 4 = (15.969+17.024=32.993; 32.993+18.009=51.002; 51.002+19.627=70.629) /4 = 17.65725 -> 17.657\n        hour3: (15.758 + 17.024 + 17.868 + 20.049) /4 = (15.758+17.024=32.782; 32.782+17.868=50.65; 50.65+20.049=70.699) /4 = 17.67475 -> 17.675\n        hour4: (15.336 + 17.587 + 17.868 + 19.697) /4 = (15.336+17.587=32.923; 32.923+17.868=50.791; 50.791+19.697=70.488) /4 = 17.622\n        hour5: (15.195 + 18.15 + 18.29 + 18.572) /4 = (15.195+18.15=33.345; 33.345+18.29=51.635; 51.635+18.572=70.207) /4 = 17.55175 -> 17.552\n        hour6: (15.336 + 17.376 + 18.994 + 18.22) /4 = (15.336+17.376=32.712; 32.712+18.994=51.706; 51.706+18.22=69.926) /4 = 17.4815 -> 17.482\n        hour7: (15.054 + 18.079 + 19.416 + 18.079) /4 = (15.054+18.079=33.133; 33.133+19.416=52.549; 52.549+18.079=70.628) /4 = 17.657\n        hour8: (16.109 + 18.501 + 20.119 + 18.22) /4 = (16.109+18.501=34.61; 34.61+20.119=54.729; 54.729+18.22=72.949) /4 = 18.23725 -> 18.237\n        hour9: (16.25 + 17.938 + 19.275 + 17.587) /4 = (16.25+17.938=34.188; 34.188+19.275=53.463; 53.463+17.587=71.05) /4 = 17.7625 -> 17.763\n        hour10: (17.165 + 18.642 + 20.19 + 18.009) /4 = (17.165+18.642=35.807; 35.807+20.19=55.997; 55.997+18.009=74.006) /4 = 18.5015 -> 18.502\n        hour11: (17.305 + 18.923 + 21.245 + 18.923) /4 = (17.305+18.923=36.228; 36.228+21.245=57.473; 57.473+18.923=76.396) /4 = 19.099\n        hour12: (17.868 + 19.134 + 21.808 + 19.768) /4 = (17.868+19.134=37.002; 37.002+21.808=58.81; 58.81+19.768=78.578) /4 = 19.6445 -> 19.645\n        hour13: (18.22 + 20.33 + 21.878 + 20.612) /4 = (18.22+20.33=38.55; 38.55+21.878=60.428; 60.428+20.612=81.04) /4 = 20.26\n        hour14: (19.275 + 19.627 + 22.23 + 20.33) /4 = (19.275+19.627=38.902; 38.902+22.23=61.132; 61.132+20.33=81.462) /4 = 20.3655 -> 20.366\n        hour15: (20.682 + 20.19 + 21.737 + 20.33) /4 = (20.682+20.19=40.872; 40.872+21.737=62.609; 62.609+20.33=82.939) /4 = 20.73475 -> 20.735\n        hour16: (21.174 + 20.471 + 22.933 + 21.737) /4 = (21.174+20.471=41.645; 41.645+22.933=64.578; 64.578+21.737=86.315) /4 = 21.57875 -> 21.579\n        hour17: (19.979 + 19.486 + 22.23 + 20.26) /4 = (19.979+19.486=39.465; 39.465+22.23=61.695; 61.695+20.26=81.955) /4 = 20.48875 -> 20.489\n        hour18: (20.119 + 19.768 + 21.526 + 19.979) /4 = (20.119+19.768=39.887; 39.887+21.526=61.413; 61.413+19.979=81.392) /4 = 20.348\n        hour19: (19.275 + 18.923 + 21.104 + 19.064) /4 = (19.275+18.923=38.198; 38.198+21.104=59.302; 59.302+19.064=78.366) /4 = 19.5915 -> 19.592\n        hour20: (18.009 + 19.064 + 20.823 + 19.205) /4 = (18.009+19.064=37.073; 37.073+20.823=57.896; 57.896+19.205=77.101) /4 = 19.27525 -> 19.275\n        hour21: (17.516 + 18.642 + 21.245 + 18.642) /4 = (17.516+18.642=36.158; 36.158+21.245=57.403; 57.403+18.642=76.045) /4 = 19.01125 -> 19.011\n        hour22: (17.305 + 18.22 + 20.823 + 17.657) /4 = (17.305+18.22=35.525; 35.525+20.823=56.348; 56.348+17.657=74.005) /4 = 18.50125 -> 18.501\n        hour23: (17.305 + 18.079 + 20.612 + 18.009) /4 = (17.305+18.079=35.384; 35.384+20.612=55.996; 55.996+18.009=74.005) /4 = 18.50125 -> 18.501\n\n 34. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-06-22 00:00:00 -> hour0: 17.886\n               2017-06-22 01:00:00 -> hour1: 17.921\n               ... until 2017-06-22 23:00:00 -> hour23: 18.501\n\n        Day2: 2017-06-23 00:00:00 -> hour0: 17.886\n               ... \n\n        Day3: 2017-06-24 00:00:00 -> hour0: 17.886\n               ...\n\n        Day4: 2017-06-25 00:00:00 -> hour0: 17.886\n               ... until 2017-06-25 23:00:00 -> hour23: 18.501\n\n 35. We write the data in the same format: two columns: date and OT.\n\n 36. We must note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. However, the averages we computed with more precision, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 38. We create the list:\n\n        Start date: 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 39. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 40. But note: the method is very simple and might not capture the trend. However, without more sophisticated modeling, this is a baseline.\n\n 41. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 42. We note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 there are none, and we are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 43. We output 96 lines.\n\n Let's write the first few:\n\n        date                 OT\n        2017-06-22 00:00:00 17.886\n        2017-06-22 01:00:00 17.921\n        2017-06-22 02:00:00 17.657\n        2017-06-22 03:00:00 17.675\n        2017-06-22 04:00:00 17.622\n        ... \n\n 44. We do the same for 4 days.\n\n 45. We must be cautious: the last provided data point is 2017-06-21 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-06-22 00:00:00.\n\n 46. We generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 47. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 48. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n 49. We output the data.\n\n 50. Since the problem does not to omit any content, we write all 96 lines.\n\n 51. We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate,OT\n2017-06-22 00:00:00,17.886\n2017-06-22 01:00:00,17.921\n2017-06-22 02:00:00,17.657\n... (until 96 lines)\n```\n\n 52. But note: the original data had the date as index? In the given data, the date is in a column. We output two columns.\n\n 53. We write without the index, just two columns.\n\n 54. We use the exact same format as the input: the date in the format and OT as float with 3 decimals.\n\n 55. We round the averages to 3 decimals.\n\n 56. We recompute the averages to ensure we have 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 17.886 (exactly: 17.886 -> 17.886)\n        hour1: 17.92075 -> 17.921\n        hour2: 17.65725 -> 17.657\n        hour3: 17.67475 -> 17.675\n        ... \n\n 57. We write the data.\n\n 58. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        We have 24 hours * 4 days = 96.\n\n        We create a list of the 24 averages, then repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 59. We create the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2017,6,22,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            OT = hourly_avg[date.hour]   # hourly_avg is a list of 24 values\n\n 60. We'll code the hourly_avg list as:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            17.886, 17.921, 17.657, 17.675, 17.622, 17.552, 17.482, 17.657, \n            18.237, 17.763, 18.502, 19.099, 19.645, 20.260, 20.366, 20.735,\n            21.579, 20.489, 20.348, 19.592, 19.275, 19.011, 18.501, 18.501\n        ]\n\n 61.
