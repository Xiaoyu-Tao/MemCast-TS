        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). The pattern: \n    - Positive values during the night and early morning (though with some variation).\n    - A drop to negative values during the day (especially in the late morning and afternoon).\n    - Then a recovery in the evening.\n\n 2. However, we also observe that the data has some missing values? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points do not have any missing values? \n    Since the problem states to be aware of missing values, we are given 96 consecutive points without gaps? But the problem says the data is sampled every 15 minutes or hourly, and here it's hourly.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 hours. We have 4 days of data (96 hours) and we are to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series model that captures seasonality. Since the seasonality is daily (24 periods) and we have only 4 days, we might use a very simple model.\n    - Given the limited history, we can consider:\n        a) Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day (or average of same hour over the available days?).\n        b) But note: the pattern is not exactly the same every day? We see some variation.\n\n 5. However, looking at the data, we see:\n    - The first day (2017-10-08) and the second day (2017-10-09) have a similar pattern, but the third day (2017-10-10) is different: \n        On 2017-10-10, the negative values during the day are not as deep and the day starts with a different pattern? Also, the drop in the morning is interrupted by a positive value at 08:00 and then a drop again? \n        Actually, 2017-10-10 has a different pattern: \n          08:00: 4.762 (positive) then 09:00: 0.426, 10:00: -5.01, 11:00: -13.006, 12:00: -7.107 (which is not as low as the previous days) and then it recovers earlier? \n    - The fourth day (2017-10-11) is again different: the day starts with positive values and then during the day (from 09:00 to 15:00) it has positive values? Actually, on 2017-10-11, the values are positive throughout? \n        But note: 09:00: 3.518, 10:00: 4.655, 11:00: 3.127, 12:00: 1.954, 13:00: 1.564, 14:00: 3.092, 15:00: 2.985 -> all positive.\n\n 6. Given the non-repeating patterns and the short history, we might consider using an average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But note: the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. \n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a model that can capture the seasonality and trend. But the trend is not clear? We have only 4 days.\n\n 8. Since the problem does not specify the method, we choose a simple method: \n    We will use the average of the same hour from the previous 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we can use:\n\n        Forecast for day5 (2017-10-12) at hour h: average of day1, day2, day3, day4 at hour h?\n        Similarly for day6, day7, day8? But we don't have day5, day6, day7 for the same hour? \n\n    Actually, we are only forecasting 4 days (96 hours) and we have 4 days of history. We can only use the same hour from the 4 days to forecast the same hour in the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use a rolling window of the last 4 same hours? But that would give a constant forecast for each hour across the 4 forecasted days? \n\n 9. We need to generate 96 different forecasts. \n\n    Option: \n        Let F(t) for t in [2017-10-12 00:00:00, 2017-10-15 23:00:00] be the average of the values at the same hour in the previous 4 days? \n        For example, for 2017-10-12 00:00:00 (which is the first hour of day5), we take the average of:\n            2017-10-08 00:00:00 -> 9.985\n            2017-10-09 00:00:00 -> 8.777\n            2017-10-10 00:00:00 -> 9.417\n            2017-10-11 00:00:00 -> 8.599\n            -> (9.985+8.777+9.417+8.599)/4 = 9.1945\n\n        Similarly, for 2017-10-12 01:00:00, we take the average of the 01:00:00 of the previous 4 days.\n\n        And so on for the first 24 hours (day5).\n\n        Then for day6 (2017-10-13) we don't have the same hour in the previous 4 days? We only have 4 days of history. \n\n        We can do:\n          For the first 24 hours of the forecast (day5): use the average of the same hour from the 4 historical days.\n          For the next 24 hours (day6): we can use the same average? because we don't have the same hour of day5? \n\n        But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We don't observed any of the forecasted days. So we have to use the same set of historical days for every hour in the forecast period? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same pattern as the last day? or the average pattern? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"forecast the data for next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n        Since we have only 4 days of history, and we are forecasting 4 days, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form a typical day, and then use that typical day for each of the 4 forecasted days? \n\n        That is, the forecast for each hour in the day (0 to 23) is the average of that hour over the 4 days. Then we repeat that same typical day for the 4 days? \n\n        But note: the data shows that the pattern is changing? The last day (2017-10-11) is different. \n\n 10. Another idea: use the last day (2017-10-11) as the forecast? But that day is different and we are to forecast 4 days? \n\n 11. Given the ambiguity and the short history, we choose to use the average of the 4 days for each hour and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n     Steps:\n        - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n        - For each hour, compute the average over the 4 days.\n        - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for hour 0, then hour 1, ... hour 23, and then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 12. Why this method?\n        - It smooths out the day-to-day variations and captures the typical daily pattern.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can compute the average without issue.\n\n 14. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (9.985 + 8.777 + 9.417 + 8.599) / 4 = (9.985+8.777=18.762; 18.762+9.417=28.179; 28.179+8.599=36.778) -> 36.778/4 = 9.1945\n        hour1: (10.163 + 9.239 + 10.056 + 7.960) / 4 = (10.163+9.239=19.402; 19.402+10.056=29.458; 29.458+7.960=37.418) -> 37.418/4 = 9.3545\n        ... and so on.\n\n 15. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then the forecast for:\n        2017-10-12 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.1945\n        2017-10-12 01:00:00 -> hour1: 9.3545\n        ...\n        2017-10-12 23:00:00 -> hour23: average of the 23rd hour of the 4 days.\n\n        Then 2017-10-13 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.1945 (same as above)\n        ... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 16. However, note that the last day in the history (2017-10-11) has a different pattern (all positive during the day). This might be a weekend? But the dates are from Sunday (2017-10-08) to Wednesday (2017-10-11). \n     The next 4 days would be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday? \n\n     But we don't have information about weekly seasonality? Only 4 days. So we ignore weekly seasonality.\n\n 17. Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Extract the hour from the datetime.\n        Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n        Step 3: Create a list of the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-10-12 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n        Step 4: For each timestamp in the forecast period, determine the hour of the day and assign the precomputed average for that hour.\n\n 18. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told that the forecast period will have missing values? We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we output 96 values without missing.\n\n 19. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        We have 4 days, 24 hours per day -> 24 groups.\n\n        We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n        Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n            day1: 9.985\n            day2: 8.777\n            day3: 9.417\n            day4: 8.599\n            avg = (9.985+8.777+9.417+8.599)/4 = 9.1945\n\n        hour1 (01:00:00):\n            day1: 10.163\n            day2: 9.239\n            day3: 10.056\n            day4: 7.960\n            avg = (10.163+9.239+10.056+7.960)/4 = 9.3545\n\n        hour2 (02:00:00):\n            day1: 9.950\n            day2: 9.026\n            day3: 9.417   # Note: 2017-10-10 02:00:00 is 9.417? Actually, the third day (2017-10-10) at 02:00:00 is 9.417? \n            But wait, the data for 2017-10-10 02:00:00 is 9.417? Actually, the data for 2017-10-10:\n                00:00:00 -> 9.417\n                01:00:00 -> 10.056\n                02:00:00 -> 9.417   -> yes.\n\n            day4: 7.747   (2017-10-11 02:00:00: 7.747)\n            avg = (9.950+9.026+9.417+7.747)/4 = (9.950+9.026=18.976; 18.976+9.417=28.393; 28.393+7.747=36.14) -> 36.14/4 = 9.035\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. We'll compute all 24 hours and then repeat the same pattern for the 4 days.\n\n 21. However, since we are to provide the complete data, we must output 96 rows.\n\n 22. Let's do the computation for all 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (9.985, 8.777, 9.417, 8.599) -> 9.1945\n        hour1: (10.163, 9.239, 10.056, 7.960) -> 9.3545\n        hour2: (9.950, 9.026, 9.417, 7.747) -> 9.035\n        hour3: (10.732, 8.422, 9.452, 8.635) -> (10.732+8.422=19.154; 19.154+9.452=28.606; 28.606+8.635=37.241) -> 9.31025\n        hour4: (9.488, 9.132, 9.808, 8.457) -> (9.488+9.132=18.62; 18.62+9.808=28.428; 28.428+8.457=36.885) -> 9.22125\n        hour5: (8.742, 7.320, 8.173, 7.462) -> (8.742+7.320=16.062; 16.062+8.173=24.235; 24.235+7.462=31.697) -> 7.92425\n        hour6: (11.869, 9.772, 9.310, 7.498) -> (11.869+9.772=21.641; 21.641+9.310=30.951; 30.951+7.498=38.449) -> 9.61225\n        hour7: (8.706, 7.498, 8.138, 8.066) -> (8.706+7.498=16.204; 16.204+8.138=24.342; 24.342+8.066=32.408) -> 8.102\n        hour8: (0.355, 0.640, 4.762, 6.076) -> (0.355+0.640=0.995; 0.995+4.762=5.757; 5.757+6.076=11.833) -> 2.95825\n        hour9: (-9.559, -9.879, 0.426, 3.518) -> (-9.559-9.879=-19.438; -19.438+0.426=-19.012; -19.012+3.518=-15.494) -> -3.8735\n        hour10: (-14.392, -14.854, -5.010, 4.655) -> (-14.392-14.854=-29.246; -29.246-5.010=-34.256; -34.256+4.655=-29.601) -> -7.40025\n        hour11: (-16.311, -17.625, -13.006, 3.127) -> (-16.311-17.625=-33.936; -33.936-13.006=-46.942; -46.942+3.127=-43.815) -> -10.95375\n        hour12: (-19.118, -19.651, -7.107, 1.954) -> (-19.118-19.651=-38.769; -38.769-7.107=-45.876; -45.876+1.954=-43.922) -> -10.9805\n        hour13: (-18.087, -18.123, -2.487, 1.564) -> (-18.087-18.123=-36.21; -36.21-2.487=-38.697; -38.697+1.564=-37.133) -> -9.28325\n        hour14: (-14.676, -15.351, 0.853, 3.092) -> (-14.676-15.351=-30.027; -30.027+0.853=-29.174; -29.174+3.092=-26.082) -> -6.5205\n        hour15: (-10.270, -10.056, -1.564, 2.985) -> (-10.270-10.056=-20.326; -20.326-1.564=-21.89; -21.89+2.985=-18.905) -> -4.72625\n        hour16: (-4.548, -4.015, 2.701, 4.300) -> (-4.548-4.015=-8.563; -8.563+2.701=-5.862; -5.862+4.300=-1.562) -> -0.3905\n        hour17: (2.843, 2.097, 4.584, 4.904) -> (2.843+2.097=4.94; 4.94+4.584=9.524; 9.524+4.904=14.428) -> 3.607\n        hour18: (4.015, 5.224, 4.939, 4.371) -> (4.015+5.224=9.239; 9.239+4.939=14.178; 14.178+4.371=18.549) -> 4.63725\n        hour19: (4.939, 5.615, 4.584, 4.015) -> (4.939+5.615=10.554; 10.554+4.584=15.138; 15.138+4.015=19.153) -> 4.78825\n        hour20: (4.584, 5.046, 4.158, 3.482) -> (4.584+5.046=9.63; 9.63+4.158=13.788; 13.788+3.482=17.27) -> 4.3175\n        hour21: (6.112, 4.762, 3.909, 3.020) -> (6.112+4.762=10.874; 10.874+3.909=14.783; 14.783+3.020=17.803) -> 4.45075\n        hour22: (7.782, 7.533, 6.503, 3.056) -> (7.782+7.533=15.315; 15.315+6.503=21.818; 21.818+3.056=24.874) -> 6.2185\n        hour23: (8.599, 9.594, 8.386, 6.325) -> (8.599+9.594=18.193; 18.193+8.386=26.579; 26.579+6.325=32.904) -> 8.226\n\n 23. Now, we create the forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2017-10-12 (Thursday) -> hours 0 to 23: [9.1945, 9.3545, 9.035, 8.226] ... (the 24 values we computed above in order)\n        Day2: 2017-10-13 (Friday) -> same 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-10-14 (Saturday) -> same 24 values\n        Day4: 2017-10-15 (Sunday) -> same 24 values\n\n 24. Format the output: \n        We must output the next 96 dates with the forecasted MUFL.\n\n        The first forecasted date: 2017-10-12 00:00:00 -> 9.1945\n        Then 2017-10-12 01:00:00 -> 9.3545\n        ... until 2017-10-15 23:00:00 -> 8.226\n\n 25. We note that the original data had 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. However, note: the average we computed might have more than 3 decimals. We round to 3.\n\n 27. Let's write the forecast for the first day (2017-10-12) as an example:\n\n        2017-10-12 00:00:00: 9.195 (rounded from 9.1945 -> 9.195? but 9.1945 is exactly 9.1945, rounding to 3 decimals: 9.195? \n        Actually, rounding rules: 9.1945 -> 9.194? because 4 is followed by 5? \n        But in Python, we can use round(x,3) which uses round half to even? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify. We'll round to 3 decimal places by rounding half up? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same precision as the input. The input has 3 decimal places, but note that some values have 3 and some have 6? Actually, the input has up to 3 decimal places? \n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll compute the average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Example: 9.1945 -> 9.194? or 9.195? \n        According to standard rounding: \n            If the next digit is 5, then round up. So 9.1945 -> 9.195? \n            But note: 9.1945 * 1000 = 9194.5 -> which rounds to 9195 when divided by 1000 -> 9.195.\n\n        So we round to 3 decimals by rounding half up.\n\n 28. We'll compute each average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 29. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output 96 rows.\n\n 30. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-10-12 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-10-15 23:00:00\n\n        We can use:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-10-12 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 31. Then assign the values:\n\n        For i in range(96):\n            hour = dates[i].hour\n            value = average[hour]   # which we computed for that hour, then rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 32. We precompute the 24 values (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat 4 times.\n\n 33. Let's recompute the averages and round:\n\n        hour0: 9.1945 -> 9.195\n        hour1: 9.3545 -> 9.355\n        hour2: 9.035 -> 9.035\n        hour3: 9.31025 -> 9.310\n        hour4: 9.22125 -> 9.221\n        hour5: 7.92425 -> 7.924\n        hour6: 9.61225 -> 9.612\n        hour7: 8.102 -> 8.102\n        hour8: 2.95825 -> 2.958\n        hour9: -3.8735 -> -3.874\n        hour10: -7.40025 -> -7.400\n        hour11: -10.95375 -> -10.954\n        hour12: -10.9805 -> -10.981\n        hour13: -9.28325 -> -9.283\n        hour14: -6.5205 -> -6.521\n        hour15: -4.72625 -> -4.726\n        hour16: -0.3905 -> -0.391\n        hour17: 3.607 -> 3.607\n        hour18: 4.63725 -> 4.637\n        hour19: 4.78825 -> 4.788\n        hour20: 4.3175 -> 4.318\n        hour21: 4.45075 -> 4.451\n        hour22: 6.2185 -> 6.219\n        hour23: 8.226 -> 8.226   (but wait: we computed 8.226? Actually, we computed 8.226? \n            (8.599+9.594+8.386+6.325) = 32.904 -> 32.904/4 = 8.226 -> so 8.226)\n\n        But note: 8.226 is already at 3 decimals? \n\n 34. Now, we create the list of 96 values:\n\n        Day1 (2017-10-12): \n            [9.195, 9.355, 8.226] -> actually we have the 24 values in order.\n\n        We'll create a list of the 24 averages (rounded) and then repeat 4 times.\n\n 35. The 24 averages (rounded) for hours 0 to 23:\n\n        [9.195, 9.355, 9.035, 9.310, 9.221, 7.924, 9.612, 8.102, 2.958, -3.874, -7.400, -10.954, -10.981, -9.283, -6.521, -4.726, -0.391, 3.607, 4.637, 4.788, 4.318, 4.451, 6.219, 8.226]\n\n 36. Then the next 96 values are:\n\n        Day1: [9.195, 8.226] (the last value of the day is 8.226 at hour23)\n        Day2: [9.195, 9.355, ... (same 24 values)\n        Day3: same\n        Day4: same\n\n 37. Now, we output in the required format.\n\n 38. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-12 00:00:00   9.195\n2017-10-12 01:00:00   9.355\n2017-10-12 02:00:00   9.035\n2017-10-12 03:00:00   9.310\n2017-10-12 04:00:00   9.221\n2017-10-12 05:00:00   7.924\n2017-10-12 06:00:00   9.612\n2017-10-12 07:00:00   8.102\n2017-10-12 08:00:00   2.958\n2017-10-12 09:00:00  -3.874\n2017-10-12 10:00:00  -7.400\n2017-10-12 11:00:00 -10.954\n2017-10-12 12:00:00 -10.981\n2017-10-12 13:00:00  -9.283\n2017-10-12 14:00:00  -6.521\n2017-10-12 15:00:00  -4.726\n2017-10-12 16:00:00  -0.391\n2017-10-12 17:00:00   3.607\n2017-10-12 18:00:00   4.637\n2017-10-12 19:00:00   4.788\n2017-10-12 20:00:00   4.318\n2017-10-12 21:00:00   4.451\n2017-10-12 22:00:00   6.219\n2017-10-12 23:00:00   8.226\n2017-10-13 00:00:00   9.195\n2017-10-13 01:00:00   9.355\n... and so on until 2017-10-15 23:00:00\n\n 39. We note: the last line of the forecast is 2017-10-15 23:00:00 -> 8.226\n\n 40. We write the code to generate the 96 lines? But we are to output the answer in the required format.\n\n 41. We'll write the 96 lines as:\n\n        date (as string) and then the value (rounded to 3 decimals) in the same format.\n\n 42. We create a list of dates:\n\n        dates = []\n        start = datetime(2017,10,12,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            d = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(d.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))\n\n 43. Then the values: \n        values = [9.195, 9.355, 9.035, 9.310, 9.221, 7.924, 9.612, 8.102, 2.958, -3.874, -7.400, -10.954, -10.981, -9.283, -6.521, -4.726, -0.391, 3.607, 4.637, 4.788, 4.318, 4.451, 6.219, 8.226] * 4\n\n 44. Then we output:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            print(f\"{dates[i]}   {values[i]:.3f}\")\n\n 45. But note: the original data had the column name \"MUFL\", but the problem does not require the header? The example input had:\n\n               date       MUFL\n        2017-10-08 00:00:00   9.985000\n\n        We are to output without the header? The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the example output format in the problem did not show the header? \n\n        We'll output without the header.\n\n 46. However, the problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". We are only outputting the two columns: the date and the value? \n\n 47. We output in the same format as the input? The input had the date as a string and the value as a float with 3 decimals? \n\n 48. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-12 00:00:00   9.195\n2017-10-12 01:00:00   9.355\n... (96 lines)\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 49. But note: the problem says \"the complete data\", so we output 96 lines.\n\n 50. We do the rounding as described.\n\n 51. Let's write the code in our mind to generate the 96 lines.\n\n 52. We'll now write the answer accordingly.\n\n 53. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. We are not given any in the forecast period? So we output 96 values without missing.\n\n 54. We are ready.\n",
