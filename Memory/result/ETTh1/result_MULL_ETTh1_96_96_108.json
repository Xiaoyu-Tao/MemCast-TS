        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations), we can consider a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon), we need a model that can extrapolate the patterns.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal model. The seasonality appears to be 24 hours (daily). We can use a seasonal naive method, or more sophisticated models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.\n\n 5. However, note that the data has some non-stationary behavior and potential multiple seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we can only capture daily seasonality.\n\n 6. We choose to use a simple model: Seasonal Naive. In this method, the forecast for each hour in the next day is the value of the same hour in the last available day (or the last season). But note: we have 4 days of data. We can use the last day (the 4th day) to forecast the next day? However, the pattern might change.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour across the 4 days? But 4 days is very few to average.\n\n 8. Another option: use an ARIMA model with seasonal components. But with only 96 points, fitting a complex model might be overfitting.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the available days. However, we only have 4 days. We can take the average of the same hour for the last 4 days? But note: the last day (2017-09-09) might be the most relevant.\n\n 10. We decide to use the last day (2017-09-09) as the base for the next day, but adjust by the trend? However, we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the 4 days. This would smooth out some noise.\n\n 12. Let's try: For hour h (where h from 00:00 to 23:00), the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n      Day 1 (2017-09-10) at h: average of h from 2017-09-06, 2017-09-07, 2017-09-08, 2017-09-09\n      Day 2 (2017-09-11) at h: same as Day1? But that would be constant for each day? That is, the same pattern repeated.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 14. We can also consider a simple exponential smoothing for the seasonal pattern? But with only 4 seasons, it's challenging.\n\n 15. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are not given any more data, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a daily pattern, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 16. Steps for calculation:\n      - Group the data by hour (00, 01, ... 23) and compute the mean for each hour across the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 17. Why this approach?\n      - It captures the daily seasonality.\n      - It smooths out the noise by averaging over 4 days.\n\n 18. However, note that the data might have a trend? Looking at the data, the values on 2017-09-09 are generally more negative than the first day? But we are only forecasting 4 days, and without a clear trend, we assume stationarity in the seasonal pattern.\n\n 19. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      Hour 00: (-0.604 + -0.391 + -0.711 + 0.213) / 4 = (-1.493) / 4 = -0.37325\n      But wait, the data for 00:00 on each day:\n          2017-09-06 00:00:00 -0.604\n          2017-09-07 00:00:00 -0.391\n          2017-09-08 00:00:00 -0.711\n          2017-09-09 00:00:00 0.213\n          Average = (-0.604 -0.391 -0.711 +0.213)/4 = (-1.493)/4 = -0.37325\n\n      Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 20. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours) we will have:\n        Day1: 2017-09-10 00:00:00 -> hour00: -0.37325\n               2017-09-10 01:00:00 -> hour01: average of 01:00 from the 4 days\n               ... until 23:00\n\n        Day2: 2017-09-11 00:00:00 -> hour00: -0.37325 (same as above)\n               and so on.\n\n 21. But note: the dates must be generated correctly. The last date in the given data is 2017-09-09 23:00:00. The next 96 hours will be from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00.\n\n 22. However, we must be cautious: the problem says the data is sampled hourly, so we generate the next 96 hours by adding 1 hour each time.\n\n 23. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = 2017-09-10 00:00:00\n        then 2017-09-10 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-10 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        then 2017-09-11 00:00:00 ... until 2017-09-11 23:00:00 (next 24)\n        then 2017-09-12 ... and 2017-09-13 ... until 2017-09-13 23:00:00 (total 96 hours)\n\n 24. We compute the hourly averages for the 24 hours from the 4 days.\n\n 25. We must round the numbers appropriately? The given data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n      Hour 0 (00:00): [ -0.604, -0.391, -0.711, 0.213 ] -> (-0.604 -0.391 -0.711 +0.213) = -1.493 -> -1.493/4 = -0.37325 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.373\n      Hour 1 (01:00): [ -0.391, -0.853, -0.533, -0.640 ] -> (-0.391 -0.853 -0.533 -0.640) = -2.417 -> -2.417/4 = -0.60425 -> -0.604\n      ... and so on.\n\n 27. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days will be the same 24 numbers repeated 4 times.\n\n 29. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we are safe to use all 4 days.\n\n 30. But what if in the future we have missing values? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 31. We'll compute the 24 hourly averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 32. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n    Hour 0: [ -0.604, -0.391, -0.711, 0.213 ] -> (-0.604 -0.391 -0.711 +0.213) = -1.493 -> -0.37325 -> -0.373\n    Hour 1: [ -0.391, -0.853, -0.533, -0.640 ] -> (-0.391 -0.853 -0.533 -0.640) = -2.417 -> -0.60425 -> -0.604\n    Hour 2: [ -0.711, -0.604, -1.848, -0.640 ] -> (-0.711 -0.604 -1.848 -0.640) = -3.803 -> -0.95075 -> -0.951\n    Hour 3: [ -0.711, -0.213, -1.848, -0.178 ] -> (-0.711 -0.213 -1.848 -0.178) = -2.950 -> -0.7375 -> -0.738\n    Hour 4: [ -0.817, 0.071, -2.061, 0.107 ] -> (-0.817+0.071-2.061+0.107) = -2.7 -> -0.675\n    Hour 5: [ -0.888, -0.426, -1.954, -1.031 ] -> (-0.888 -0.426 -1.954 -1.031) = -4.299 -> -1.07475 -> -1.075\n    Hour 6: [ -1.244, -2.381, -1.848, -0.995 ] -> (-1.244 -2.381 -1.848 -0.995) = -6.468 -> -1.617\n    Hour 7: [ -0.320, -0.995, -1.777, -0.426 ] -> (-0.320 -0.995 -1.777 -0.426) = -3.518 -> -0.8795 -> -0.880\n    Hour 8: [ -1.386, -1.812, -1.706, 0.036 ] -> (-1.386 -1.812 -1.706 +0.036) = -4.868 -> -1.217\n    Hour 9: [ -1.883, -1.066, -1.386, -0.817 ] -> (-1.883 -1.066 -1.386 -0.817) = -5.152 -> -1.288\n    Hour 10: [ -1.954, -0.604, -0.213, -0.569 ] -> (-1.954 -0.604 -0.213 -0.569) = -3.34 -> -0.835\n    Hour 11: [ -1.954, -0.888, 1.812, -0.320 ] -> (-1.954 -0.888 +1.812 -0.320) = (-1.954-0.888-0.320+1.812)= (-1.35) -> -0.3375 -> -0.338\n    Hour 12: [ -2.559, -2.132, -0.746, -0.995 ] -> (-2.559 -2.132 -0.746 -0.995) = -6.432 -> -1.608\n    Hour 13: [ -2.416, 0.071, 0.497, 1.031 ] -> (-2.416 +0.071+0.497+1.031) = (-2.416+1.599) = -0.817 -> -0.20425 -> -0.204\n    Hour 14: [ -2.345, -0.888, 0.675, 0.497 ] -> (-2.345 -0.888 +0.675 +0.497) = (-2.345-0.888+1.172) = (-2.061) -> -0.51525 -> -0.515\n    Hour 15: [ -2.097, -1.564, -0.107, -0.497 ] -> (-2.097 -1.564 -0.107 -0.497) = -4.265 -> -1.06625 -> -1.066\n    Hour 16: [ -2.630, -0.640, -1.137, -0.959 ] -> (-2.630 -0.640 -1.137 -0.959) = -5.366 -> -1.3415 -> -1.342\n    Hour 17: [ -2.487, -1.954, -2.168, -2.310 ] -> (-2.487 -1.954 -2.168 -2.310) = -8.919 -> -2.22975 -> -2.230\n    Hour 18: [ -2.630, -2.203, -2.736, -2.630 ] -> (-2.630 -2.203 -2.736 -2.630) = -10.199 -> -2.54975 -> -2.550\n    Hour 19: [ -2.772, -2.487, -2.772, -2.736 ] -> (-2.772 -2.487 -2.772 -2.736) = -10.767 -> -2.69175 -> -2.692\n    Hour 20: [ -2.630, -2.416, -2.594, -2.452 ] -> (-2.630 -2.416 -2.594 -2.452) = -10.092 -> -2.523\n    Hour 21: [ -1.492, -3.020, -2.381, -2.416 ] -> (-1.492 -3.020 -2.381 -2.416) = -9.309 -> -2.32725 -> -2.327\n    Hour 22: [ -1.954, -2.452, -1.528, -2.097 ] -> (-1.954 -2.452 -1.528 -2.097) = -8.031 -> -2.00775 -> -2.008\n    Hour 23: [ -0.497, -1.919, -1.173, -1.457 ] -> (-0.497 -1.919 -1.173 -1.457) = -5.046 -> -1.2615 -> -1.262\n\n 33. Now, we have 24 values (from hour0 to hour23) for one day.\n\n 34. We will use these 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 35. Generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-10 00:00:00\n      End: 2017-09-13 23:00:00\n\n 36. We'll create 96 rows.\n\n 37. Example:\n\n        date: 2017-09-10 00:00:00 -> MULL = -0.373\n        date: 2017-09-10 01:00:00 -> MULL = -0.604\n        ... until 2017-09-10 23:00:00 -> MULL = -1.262\n\n        then 2017-09-11 00:00:00 -> MULL = -0.373\n        and so on.\n\n 38. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 39. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 40. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns (date and MULL), with the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the MULL value as a float with 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. We'll generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 42. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # For the MULL value, we use the hour of the day (current_date.hour) to index our 24-hour pattern.\n            hour_index = current_date.hour\n            mull_value = hourly_avg[hour_index]\n\n 43. But note: the hourly_avg list is in the order of hour0 to hour23.\n\n 44.
