        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load values show a pattern that repeats every 24 hours.\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data? But the given data for 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours) is complete. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values? \n    Since the problem says to be aware of missing values, we should handle them. But in the provided data, there are no missing values. So for the given data, we can proceed without imputation for the historical part.\n 3. For forecasting, we can use a method that handles seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps (which is multiple seasonal periods of 24) and we have hourly data, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple seasonal naive method, but that might not capture trends. However, looking at the data, there is a strong daily pattern but not a clear long-term trend over the 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component and the residual? \n   - Or use an exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters).\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days (96 points). This is a very short series for complex models.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - The last complete season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 repetitions of the last day.\n\n But let's observe: \n   The data from 2017-09-26 to 2017-09-29 (4 days) shows a similar pattern each day? \n\n   However, looking at the values, they are not exactly the same. We can try to capture the average daily pattern and then adjust by the level of the last day?\n\n Another idea: \n   We can use a moving average method to capture the daily pattern and then project forward.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. Since we are only given 96 points without missing values, we can assume that the next 96 might have missing? \n   But the instruction is to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must output 96 values.\n\n How to handle the forecast?\n   We can use the following simple method:\n     - Compute the average pattern for each hour of the day over the 4 days we have.\n     - Then, use that average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the average pattern:\n   Group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean.\n\n But note: the data shows a drift? Let's see the values at 00:00:\n   2017-09-26 00:00:00  0.701\n   2017-09-27 00:00:00 -0.975\n   2017-09-28 00:00:00 -0.731\n   2017-09-29 00:00:00 -0.670\n\n The values are decreasing? But then we have only 4 days. We might consider using the last day's pattern and adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n   Forecast each hour by the value of the same hour in the previous day? But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the last 2 or 3 days? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the method. We are the expert.\n\n Considering the short history, we need to forecast 4 days (96 hours). We can do:\n\n   Let F(t) for t in [0, 95] (the next 96 hours) be:\n\n      F(t) = average of the same hour in the past 4 days.\n\n   But note: the data shows a downward trend? We might want to account for that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing for the level and seasonality? But with only 4 seasons, it's hard.\n\n   Another idea: use the average daily pattern and then adjust by the last day's average level? \n\n   Step 1: Compute the average for each day:\n        Day1 (2017-09-26): average of 24 points = ?\n        Day2: ... \n        Day3: ...\n        Day4: ...\n\n   Step 2: Compute the overall average pattern (hourly) over the 4 days.\n\n   Step 3: For the next 4 days, we can set the level to the last day's average? or the average of the last two days? \n\n   We can do:\n        base_level = (average of day3 + average of day4) / 2   [or just day4?]\n\n        Then, for each hour i (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we set:\n            forecast[i + 24] = base_level + (hourly_pattern[i] - overall_daily_average)\n\n   But let me explain:\n\n        Let H[i] = average of hour i over the 4 days.\n        Let overall_daily_average = average of all 96 points.\n\n        Then the base_level for the next day might be the level of the last day (day4) which is the average of day4.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour i on the next day = (average of day4) + (H[i] - overall_daily_average)\n\n   But this might not be the best.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average pattern without level adjustment? \n\n   Since the pattern is consistent, we can simply use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for each of the next 4 days? \n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (0.701 + (-0.975) + (-0.731) + (-0.670)) / 4 = (0.701 -0.975 -0.731 -0.670)/4 = (-1.675)/4 = -0.41875\n   hour1: (0.609 + (-1.005) + (-0.761) + (-0.914)) /4 = (0.609 -1.005 -0.761 -0.914)/4 = (-2.071)/4 = -0.51775\n\n   But then we would have for the next 4 days:\n\n        day5: hour0: -0.41875, hour1: -0.51775, ... \n        day6: same as day5? \n\n   This would be 4 repetitions of the same daily pattern.\n\n   However, we note that the data has a trend? The last day (day4) is generally lower than the first day. But we are to forecast the next 4 days, which is immediately after. \n   Without a clear trend model, we might assume the pattern is stable? \n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n   So for the next 96 hours, we will have 4 repetitions of the 24-hour average pattern.\n\n   How to compute:\n\n        We have 4 days, so for each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the mean of that hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days, we assign:\n            Day1 (2017-09-30) hour0: mean_hour0, hour1: mean_hour1, ... hour23: mean_hour23\n            Day2 (2017-10-01): same as above\n            Day3 (2017-10-02): same\n            Day4 (2017-10-03): same\n\n   But note: the dates must be continuous. The last given date is 2017-09-29 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-09-30 00:00:00.\n\n   We are to forecast 96 hours, which is 4 days: from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour of the day from the datetime. But note the data is hourly and we have 4 full days.\n\n   Step 2: Group by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean.\n\n   Step 3: Create the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-09-30 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-03 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 4: For each hour in the day (0 to 23) for the next 4 days, assign the precomputed mean for that hour.\n\n   However, note: the data we are given has negative values and positive. The average pattern might smooth out the daily pattern.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n        hour00: (0.701 -0.975 -0.731 -0.670)/4 = (0.701 - 0.38) [wait: 0.701 -0.975 = -0.274, then -0.274 -0.731 = -1.005, then -1.005-0.670 = -1.675] -> -1.675/4 = -0.41875\n        hour01: (0.609 -1.005 -0.761 -0.914)/4 = (0.609 -1.005 = -0.396; -0.396-0.761 = -1.157; -1.157-0.914 = -2.071) -> -2.071/4 = -0.51775\n        hour02: (0.609 -0.975 -0.792 -1.036)/4 = (0.609-0.975=-0.366; -0.366-0.792=-1.158; -1.158-1.036=-2.194) -> -2.194/4 = -0.5485\n        hour03: (0.609 -1.005 -0.975 -1.036)/4 = (0.609-1.005=-0.396; -0.396-0.975=-1.371; -1.371-1.036=-2.407) -> -2.407/4 = -0.60175\n        hour04: (0.761 -0.944 -0.883 -1.066)/4 = (0.761-0.944=-0.183; -0.183-0.883=-1.066; -1.066-1.066=-2.132) -> -2.132/4 = -0.533\n        hour05: (0.761 -0.914 -0.822 -0.914)/4 = (0.761-0.914=-0.153; -0.153-0.822=-0.975; -0.975-0.914=-1.889) -> -1.889/4 = -0.47225\n        hour06: (0.853 -0.822 -0.761 -0.975)/4 = (0.853-0.822=0.031; 0.031-0.761=-0.73; -0.73-0.975=-1.705) -> -1.705/4 = -0.42625\n        hour07: (0.822 -0.761 -0.701 -0.853)/4 = (0.822-0.761=0.061; 0.061-0.701=-0.64; -0.64-0.853=-1.493) -> -1.493/4 = -0.37325\n        hour08: (1.157 -0.548 -0.457 -0.670)/4 = (1.157-0.548=0.609; 0.609-0.457=0.152; 0.152-0.670=-0.518) -> -0.518/4 = -0.1295\n        hour09: (1.127 -0.487 -0.579 -0.670)/4 = (1.127-0.487=0.64; 0.64-0.579=0.061; 0.061-0.670=-0.609) -> -0.609/4 = -0.15225\n        hour10: (1.127 -0.579 -0.518 -0.670)/4 = (1.127-0.579=0.548; 0.548-0.518=0.03; 0.03-0.670=-0.64) -> -0.64/4 = -0.16\n        hour11: (1.157 -0.731 -0.640 -0.883)/4 = (1.157-0.731=0.426; 0.426-0.640=-0.214; -0.214-0.883=-1.097) -> -1.097/4 = -0.27425\n        hour12: (1.097 -0.792 -0.670 -1.036)/4 = (1.097-0.792=0.305; 0.305-0.670=-0.365; -0.365-1.036=-1.401) -> -1.401/4 = -0.35025\n        hour13: (1.249 -0.640 -0.579 -0.914)/4 = (1.249-0.640=0.609; 0.609-0.579=0.03; 0.03-0.914=-0.884) -> -0.884/4 = -0.221\n        hour14: (1.066 -0.518 -0.609 -0.914)/4 = (1.066-0.518=0.548; 0.548-0.609=-0.061; -0.061-0.914=-0.975) -> -0.975/4 = -0.24375\n        hour15: (1.157 -0.609 -0.548 -0.914)/4 = (1.157-0.609=0.548; 0.548-0.548=0; 0-0.914=-0.914) -> -0.914/4 = -0.2285\n        hour16: (0.944 -0.731 -0.640 -0.975)/4 = (0.944-0.731=0.213; 0.213-0.640=-0.427; -0.427-0.975=-1.402) -> -1.402/4 = -0.3505\n        hour17: (0.701 -0.853 -0.761 -0.944)/4 = (0.701-0.853=-0.152; -0.152-0.761=-0.913; -0.913-0.944=-1.857) -> -1.857/4 = -0.46425\n        hour18: (-1.005 -0.883 -0.853 -1.005)/4 = (-1.005-0.883=-1.888; -1.888-0.853=-2.741; -2.741-1.005=-3.746) -> -3.746/4 = -0.9365\n        hour19: (-1.127 -0.853 -0.701 -1.005)/4 = (-1.127-0.853=-1.98; -1.98-0.701=-2.681; -2.681-1.005=-3.686) -> -3.686/4 = -0.9215\n        hour20: (-1.005 -0.761 -0.822 -0.944)/4 = (-1.005-0.761=-1.766; -1.766-0.822=-2.588; -2.588-0.944=-3.532) -> -3.532/4 = -0.883\n        hour21: (-0.548 -0.761 -0.883 -0.944)/4 = (-0.548-0.761=-1.309; -1.309-0.883=-2.192; -2.192-0.944=-3.136) -> -3.136/4 = -0.784\n        hour22: (-0.914 -0.761 -0.944 -0.975)/4 = (-0.914-0.761=-1.675; -1.675-0.944=-2.619; -2.619-0.975=-3.594) -> -3.594/4 = -0.8985\n        hour23: (-0.792 -0.731 -0.883 -0.914)/4 = (-0.792-0.731=-1.523; -1.523-0.883=-2.406; -2.406-0.914=-3.32) -> -3.32/4 = -0.83\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-30): \n            00:00:00 -> -0.41875\n            01:00:00 -> -0.51775\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> -0.83\n\n        Day2 (2017-10-01): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-10-02): same\n        Day4 (2017-10-03): same\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are generating the forecast, so we are to output 96 values without missing? \n\n   We are to output the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n   Format: \n        date (from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00) and the corresponding LULL value (the computed mean for that hour).\n\n   We must output in the same format as the input, with the same precision (3 decimal places?).\n\n   But note: the input has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, the computed means might have more. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Example: \n        hour00: -0.41875 -> -0.419\n        hour01: -0.51775 -> -0.518\n\n   But let's check: \n        -0.41875 rounded to 3 decimal: \n            look at the 4th decimal: 7>=5 -> round up: -0.419\n\n   However, note: negative numbers: rounding -0.41875: \n        The absolute value is 0.41875 -> rounded to 0.419, so negative: -0.419.\n\n   We'll do that for all.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the exact value without rounding? But the input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let hourly_means = [ \n            -0.41875, -0.51775, -0.5485, -0.60175, -0.533, -0.47225, -0.42625, -0.37325, \n            -0.1295, -0.15225, -0.16, -0.27425, -0.35025, -0.221, -0.24375, -0.2285, \n            -0.3505, -0.46425, -0.9365, -0.9215, -0.883, -0.784, -0.8985, -0.83 \n        ]\n\n        Then round each to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n   But note: the order of the hours? We have computed for hour0 (00:00) to hour23 (23:00). So we have 24 values.\n\n   Then the next 96 hours: \n        first 24: the list above (rounded) for 2017-09-30\n        next 24: same for 2017-10-01\n        next 24: same for 2017-10-02\n        last 24: same for 2017-10-03\n\n   Now, generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-30 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-30 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-30 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-10-01 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-01 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-10-02 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-02 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-10-03 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-03 23:00:00\n\n   We can use Python to generate the dates, but since we are writing the answer, we will write them manually? \n   But 96 lines. We can write a loop in our mind.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write the data in the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-30 00:00:00  -0.419\n2017-09-30 01:00:00  -0.518\n2017-09-30 02:00:00  -0.549\n2017-09-30 03:00:00  -0.602\n2017-09-30 04:00:00  -0.533\n2017-09-30 05:00:00  -0.472\n2017-09-30 06:00:00  -0.426\n2017-09-30 07:00:00  -0.373\n2017-09-30 08:00:00  -0.130\n2017-09-30 09:00:00  -0.152\n2017-09-30 10:00:00  -0.160\n2017-09-30 11:00:00  -0.274\n2017-09-30 12:00:00  -0.350\n2017-09-30 13:00:00  -0.221\n2017-09-30 14:00:00  -0.244\n2017-09-30 15:00:00  -0.228\n2017-09-30 16:00:00  -0.351\n2017-09-30 17:00:00  -0.464\n2017-09-30 18:00:00  -0.937\n2017-09-30 19:00:00  -0.922\n2017-09-30 20:00:00  -0.883\n2017-09-30 21:00:00  -0.784\n2017-09-30 22:00:00  -0.899\n2017-09-30 23:00:00  -0.830\n2017-10-01 00:00:00  -0.419\n2017-10-01 01:00:00  -0.518\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n   But note: we must be consistent with the rounding.\n\n   Let me recompute the rounding for each:\n\n        hour00: -0.41875 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            The fourth decimal is 7, so round up: 0.41875 -> 0.419 -> so -0.419\n        hour01: -0.51775 -> 0.51775 -> 0.518 -> -0.518\n        hour02: -0.5485 -> 0.5485 -> 0.549 (because 8 is followed by 5, and we round up the 8 to 9) -> -0.549\n        hour03: -0.60175 -> 0.60175 -> 0.602 -> -0.602\n        hour04: -0.533 -> already 3 decimals? but wait: -0.53300 -> so -0.533\n        hour05: -0.47225 -> 0.47225 -> 0.472 (because the third decimal is 2 and the fourth is 5? Actually, 0.47225: \n            The third decimal is 2, the fourth is 2 -> which is less than 5, so we leave it? \n            But wait: 0.47225: \n                We look at the fourth decimal: 2, which is <5 -> so 0.472 -> but that would be 3 decimals: 0.472 -> -0.472\n        However, note: 0.47225 rounded to 3 decimals: \n            The digit in the 4th decimal is 2, so we do not round up -> 0.472 -> -0.472\n        But wait, the input had 0.761, 0.609, etc. So we are rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n        Let me do the rounding for all:\n\n            h00: -0.41875 -> -0.419\n            h01: -0.51775 -> -0.518\n            h02: -0.5485  -> -0.549   (because 0.5485: 8 is at the 3rd, 5 at the 4th -> round up 8 to 9 -> 0.549 -> -0.549)\n            h03: -0.60175 -> -0.602\n            h04: -0.533   -> -0.533   (exactly, because 0.53300 -> 0.533)\n            h05: -0.47225 -> -0.472   (because 0.47225: 2 at the 3rd, 2 at the 4th -> no round up? but wait: 0.47225: \n                    the 4th is 2, so we leave the 3rd as 2 -> 0.472 -> -0.472)\n            However, note: 0.47225: \n                The third decimal is 2, and the fourth is 2 which is less than 5 -> so we leave -> 0.472 -> -0.472.\n\n            But wait, the number is negative: the rule is the same: round the absolute value and then apply sign.\n\n            h06: -0.42625 -> 0.42625 -> 0.426 (because 6 is the third, 2 is the fourth -> but wait: 0.42625: \n                the fourth decimal is 2 -> so 0.426 -> -0.426? \n                But note: 0.42625: the third decimal is 6, and the fourth is 2 -> so we leave the 6 -> 0.426 -> -0.426.\n\n            However, let me check: \n                0.42625: \n                    We are at the third decimal: 6 is the thousandths place, then 2 is the ten thousandths -> so we leave the 6 -> 0.426.\n\n            But wait: 0.42625 is closer to 0.426 than to 0.427? Actually, 0.42625 is exactly halfway? \n                No, halfway would be 0.42650. So 0.42625 is less than 0.4265 -> so we round down? \n\n            The standard rounding rule: \n                If the digit to be removed is less than 5, leave the digit unchanged.\n                So: 0.42625: the digit in the third decimal is 6, and the next is 2 -> so we leave 6 -> 0.426.\n\n            But note: the number is 0.42625, which is 42625/100000. We want 3 decimals: \n                We look at the fourth decimal: 2 -> so we leave the third decimal as 6 -> 0.426.\n\n            So h06: -0.426\n\n            h07: -0.37325 -> 0.37325 -> 0.373 (because 3 at the third, 2 at the fourth -> leave) -> -0.373\n\n            h08: -0.1295 -> 0.1295: \n                third decimal is 9, fourth is 5 -> we round up the 9 -> becomes 10 -> so 0.130 -> -0.130\n\n            h09: -0.15225 -> 0.15225 -> 0.152 (because 2 at the third, 2 at the fourth -> leave) -> -0.152\n\n            h10: -0.16 -> but wait: -0.16 is -0.16000 -> so -0.160? \n                But the input has 3 decimals. We write -0.160? \n                However, the input sometimes omits trailing zeros? But we are to output in the same format.\n\n            The input: \n                0.701, 0.609, ... so we have 3 decimals.\n\n            So we output 3 decimals: \n                h10: -0.16 -> we write as -0.160? \n                But note: -0.16 is the same as -0.160. We can write -0.160.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write without the trailing zero? But the input has 3 decimals. So we write:\n\n                h10: -0.160   (because 0.16 is 0.160 when written to 3 decimals)\n\n            How we rounded: \n                0.15225 -> 0.152 -> -0.152\n            h10: -0.16 -> we have computed the mean as -0.16?
