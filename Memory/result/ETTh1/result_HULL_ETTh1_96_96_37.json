        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series structure with potential seasonality (daily cycles) and possible missing values (though the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points).\n 2. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the future? But the problem says the data will have missing values. However, we are to forecast the next 96 points. \n    Since we are generating a forecast, we will produce 96 points without any missing values. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided past might have missing values? \n    However, the provided past data does not have missing values. So we assume we are to forecast 96 points without missing values.\n\n 3. We choose a model: Given the hourly data and the likely daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model. \n    Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 96 points (4 days), we can use a model that captures daily patterns.\n\n 4. We consider using a simple seasonal naive model, but that might not capture trends. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonality.\n    However, with only 4 days of data, it is challenging to fit a complex seasonal model. \n\n 5. Another idea: We can use the average of the same hour across the 4 available days to forecast the next 4 days? \n    But note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (2016-11-29) which has lower values? \n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a moving average model with seasonality. \n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component while assuming the trend is constant? \n\n 8. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we assume the forecast must be for 96 consecutive hours without missing values.\n\n 9. We decide to use a simple method: \n    - Compute the average pattern for a day (24 hours) from the 4 days we have. \n    - Then, for each hour in the next 4 days, we use the average of that hour from the previous 4 days.\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-11-26): mean = (sum of 24 values) \n        Day 2: mean\n        Day 3: mean\n        Day 4: mean\n\n    We can adjust by the daily mean? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 10. Since we have only 4 days, we can also use a naive method: use the same pattern as the last day for each of the next 4 days? \n     But the last day (2016-11-29) has a different magnitude? \n\n 11. We can compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? \n\n     Example: \n        For hour 00:00: average of [5.224, 5.224, 6.296, 6.698] = (5.224+5.224+6.296+6.698)/4 = 5.8605\n        Then for each of the next 4 days at 00:00, we use 5.8605? \n\n     But that would be too flat and ignore any trend.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? \n\n 13. Given the short history, we can use the Seasonal Naive method: \n        Forecast for day5 at hour h = value from day4 at hour h\n        Forecast for day6 at hour h = value from day5 at hour h? But we don't have day5.\n\n     Actually, we can only use the last available day (day4) for the next day? Then for the next 4 days, we repeat day4? \n\n     But the problem: \n        Day1: 2016-11-26\n        Day2: 2016-11-27\n        Day3: 2016-11-28\n        Day4: 2016-11-29\n\n     Then:\n        Day5 (2016-11-30) = repeat day4 (2016-11-29) \n        Day6 (2016-12-01) = repeat day4 (2016-11-29) \n        Day7, Day8: same.\n\n     However, we note that the values on 2016-11-29 are generally lower than the previous days? \n\n 14. We can also consider using the average of the last 4 days? \n\n 15. After examining the data, we see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. \n\n 16. We decide to use a simple average of the 4 days for each hour. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out any daily variations.\n\n 17. Steps for the average method:\n        For hour h (0 to 23):\n            value = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, each day at hour h we use that computed average.\n\n 18. But note: the data for the same hour across days might have a trend? We don't have enough to model a trend.\n\n 19. We'll go with the average method.\n\n 20. However, let's check the data for the same hour (00:00) of each day:\n\n        Day1: 5.224\n        Day2: 5.224\n        Day3: 6.296\n        Day4: 6.698\n\n        Average = (5.224+5.224+6.296+6.698)/4 = 5.8605\n\n        Similarly, for 01:00:\n\n        Day1: 4.957\n        Day2: 5.157\n        Day3: 6.296\n        Day4: 6.564\n        Average = (4.957+5.157+6.296+6.564)/4 = 5.7435\n\n    21. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 22. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 23. We generate the dates starting from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n\n 24. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are generating the forecast without missing values.\n\n 25. We must output the complete 96 points.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Step 1: Parse the given data and group by hour of day (0-23) for the 4 days.\n\n    Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of the 4 values.\n\n    Step 3: Create a list for the next 96 hours: \n        Start at 2016-11-30 00:00:00, then 2016-11-30 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n\n    Step 4: For each day in the 4 days (0 to 3) and for each hour in 0 to 23, assign the average for that hour.\n\n    So the forecast for:\n        2016-11-30 00:00:00 -> average of 00:00\n        2016-11-30 01:00:00 -> average of 01:00\n        ...\n        2016-11-30 23:00:00 -> average of 23:00\n        2016-12-01 00:00:00 -> average of 00:00\n        ... and so on.\n\n 26. We output the 96 records in the required format.\n\n 27. However, note: the data we are given ends at 2016-11-29 23:00:00. The next hour is 2016-11-30 00:00:00.\n\n 28. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But note: the provided data has 96 points, which is exactly 4 days (24*4=96). We can group by hour.\n\n We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n Steps:\n\n    hour00: indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n    hour01: indices 1, 25, 49, 73\n    ... \n    hour23: indices 23, 47, 71, 95\n\n 29. We compute:\n\n        hourly_avg[0] = (5.224 + 5.224 + 6.296 + 6.698) / 4\n        ... \n\n 30. Then we create 4 days of 24 hours each, using the same `hourly_avg` for each day.\n\n 31. Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-30 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-11-30 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-12-03 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 32. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We'll extract the HULL values and then group by hour index.\n\n Implementation in code:\n\n    data = [5.224, 4.957, ...]  # 96 values\n\n    hourly_avg = [0]*24\n    for hour in range(24):\n        indices = [hour, hour+24, hour+48, hour+72]\n        total = 0\n        for i in indices:\n            total += data[i]\n        hourly_avg[hour] = round(total/4, 3)   # rounding to 3 decimals as in the input\n\n 33. Then we create the dates:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 11, 30)   # but note: the last date in the data is 2016-11-29, so next is 2016-11-30\n        However, the given data starts at 2016-11-26, so the next day is 2016-11-30? \n\n        Actually, the last date in the provided data is 2016-11-29 23:00:00. So the next date is 2016-11-30 00:00:00.\n\n        We need 4 days: 2016-11-30, 2016-12-01, 2016-12-02, 2016-12-03.\n\n        Note: November has 30 days, so:\n            2016-11-30 is the next day after 2016-11-29.\n            2016-12-01 is the next.\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        base = datetime(2016, 11, 30, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = []\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                current = base + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                dates.append(current)\n\n        But note: we are generating 4*24=96 hours.\n\n 35. Then for each date in dates, we assign the value: \n        value = hourly_avg[hour]   # because for each day we are repeating the same pattern.\n\n 36. Format each date as string: \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n\n 37. Print the date and the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the past, and we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We'll write a small code to compute the averages.\n\n    But note: we are not allowed to run external code? We have to do it manually? \n\n    Alternatively, we can do it step by step.\n\n    We'll create a list of the 96 values:\n\n        data = [\n            5.224, 4.957, 3.818, 4.153, 4.823, 5.559, 4.153, 4.086, 5.090, 4.354, 3.952, 4.287, 2.880, 3.684, 3.617, 3.617, 3.014, 2.679, 2.746, 2.411, 2.545, 2.009, 2.344, 4.354,\n            5.224, 5.157, 4.890, 4.421, 4.622, 4.823, 3.483, 4.957, 4.689, 4.488, 4.622, 3.550, 2.947, 4.019, 4.421, 4.019, 4.086, 3.684, 2.746, 3.014, 2.545, 1.875, 4.354, 5.023,\n            6.296, 6.296, 5.693, 5.626, 5.157, 5.224, 4.823, 6.028, 5.693, 4.019, 4.488, 3.818, 2.947, 4.153, 4.823, 4.622, 3.818, 3.416, 3.014, 2.947, 2.411, 1.273, 4.689, 4.957,\n            6.698, 6.564, 5.559, 5.425, 6.631, 5.760, 6.296, 6.363, 4.622, 4.153, 3.550, 3.416, 2.009, 3.282, 3.617, 2.947, 2.947, 2.880, 2.545, 2.210, 2.344, 1.875, 1.942, 3.684\n        ]\n\n    Now, for hour0 (00:00): indices 0, 24, 48, 72 -> 5.224, 5.224, 6.296, 6.698 -> average = (5.224+5.224+6.296+6.698)/4 = 23.442/4 = 5.8605 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 5.861\n\n    hour1 (01:00): indices 1,25,49,73 -> 4.957, 5.157, 6.296, 6.564 -> (4.957+5.157+6.296+6.564)=23.974 -> 23.974/4=5.9935 -> 5.994\n\n    hour2 (02:00): 3.818, 4.890, 5.693, 5.559 -> (3.818+4.890+5.693+5.559)=19.96 -> 19.96/4=4.99\n\n    hour3 (03:00): 4.153, 4.421, 5.626, 5.425 -> (4.153+4.421+5.626+5.425)=19.625 -> 19.625/4=4.90625 -> 4.906\n\n    hour4 (04:00): 4.823, 4.622, 5.157, 6.631 -> (4.823+4.622+5.157+6.631)=21.233 -> 21.233/4=5.30825 -> 5.308\n\n    hour5 (05:00): 5.559, 4.823, 5.224, 5.760 -> (5.559+4.823+5.224+5.760)=21.366 -> 21.366/4=5.3415 -> 5.342\n\n    hour6 (06:00): 4.153, 3.483, 4.823, 6.296 -> (4.153+3.483+4.823+6.296)=18.755 -> 18.755/4=4.68875 -> 4.689\n\n    hour7 (07:00): 4.086, 4.957, 6.028, 6.363 -> (4.086+4.957+6.028+6.363)=21.434 -> 21.434/4=5.3585 -> 5.359\n\n    hour8 (08:00): 5.090, 4.689, 5.693, 4.622 -> (5.090+4.689+5.693+4.622)=20.094 -> 20.094/4=5.0235 -> 5.024\n\n    But wait: the 8th hour of day1 is 5.090, day2: 4.689, day3: 5.693, day4: 4.622 -> average=5.0235 -> 5.024\n\n    However, note: the data for day2 at 08:00 is 4.689?
