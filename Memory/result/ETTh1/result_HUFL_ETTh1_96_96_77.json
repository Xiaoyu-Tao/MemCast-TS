        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-05-05 00:00:00 to 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-05-09 00:00:00 to 2017-05-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided segment, there are no missing values. We must be cautious in the forecasting method to handle potential missingness, but for this task we are only given 96 complete points.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that can handle multiple seasonality. However, note that we only have 4 days of data, so the seasonality we can capture is daily (24 hours).\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). But note that with only 4 days, the estimation of weekly seasonality is not possible. We only have daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing, but they might not capture the seasonality well.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can try to capture the daily pattern and also the trend.\n\n 7. However, note that the data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days, but rather a daily cycle. Therefore, we can use a seasonal naive method: using the last day (24 hours) as the forecast for the next day, and then repeat for 4 days? But we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) and we have 4 days of history. But the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an average of the 4 days for each hour? But that would ignore any trend.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are an expert, we can use a more sophisticated model. However, without more data (like several weeks) it is hard to capture long-term patterns.\n\n 10. We can use a simple approach: decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual, then forecast each component.\n\n 11. But note: we are only given 4 days, so we can only capture the daily seasonality. We can use STL decomposition (if we had more data, but 4 days is minimal) and then forecast the seasonally adjusted series with a simple method and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a model like Prophet, but we are not in a position to run Prophet.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, we can use a simple average of the four days for each hour of the day to form the seasonal component, and then adjust by the last observed trend? But the trend over 4 days is not strong.\n\n 14. Let's try to compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     hour0: (9.31 + 7.77 + 6.966 + 11.119) / 4 = ?\n     ... and so on.\n\n 15. But note: the last day (2017-05-08) has higher values than the previous days. So there might be an increasing trend? Let's check:\n\n     2017-05-05: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n     2017-05-06: average = ?\n     2017-05-07: average = ?\n     2017-05-08: average = ?\n\n 16. We can compute the daily averages:\n\n     Day1 (05-05): \n        values: [9.31, 9.176, ... , 6.162] -> average = ?\n\n     But without computing, we can see that the values on 05-08 are generally higher.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a linear regression on the entire series to get a trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 18. Steps for forecasting:\n\n     a. Extract the seasonal component by averaging each hour across the 4 days.\n     b. De-trend the series by subtracting the seasonal component.\n     c. Model the de-trended series (which should be the trend + residual) with a linear regression (or just take the average of the de-trended series? or use a moving average?).\n     But note: we have only 4 days, so the trend might be linear? We can fit a linear trend to the de-trended series.\n\n     d. Then for forecasting, we project the linear trend for the next 96 hours and add the seasonal component for the corresponding hours.\n\n 19. However, the de-trended series might still have autocorrelation. But with limited data, we might not capture it.\n\n 20. Given the time and simplicity, we can do:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the hourly averages (over the 4 days) for each of the 24 hours.\n\n        seasonal_component = [ avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... , avg_hour23 ]\n\n     Step 2: Subtract the seasonal component from the original series to get the de-seasonalized series.\n\n     Step 3: Fit a linear trend to the de-seasonalized series (using time as feature). The time points are 0 to 95.\n\n        Let: t = [0,1,...,95] for the historical data.\n\n        Model: de_seasonalized(t) = a + b*t + error\n\n     Step 4: Forecast the trend for t=96 to 191 (next 96 points) using the linear model.\n\n     Step 5: Add back the seasonal component for the corresponding hour.\n\n        For the first hour of the forecast (t=96, which is 2017-05-09 00:00:00) we use the seasonal component for hour0.\n        t=97: hour1, ... until t=119: hour23, then t=120: hour0, and so on.\n\n 21. But note: the linear trend might not be the best, but it is simple.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the last value of the de-seasonalized series and assume it remains constant? But that would be naive.\n\n 23. We'll go with the linear trend.\n\n 24. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a non-linear trend. But with 4 days, linear is a reasonable approximation.\n\n 25. Let's do the steps:\n\n     a. Compute the seasonal component (hourly averages):\n\n        We have 4 days, so for each hour in [0,23] we have 4 values.\n\n        Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n            day1: 9.31\n            day2: 7.77\n            day3: 6.966\n            day4: 11.119\n            avg = (9.31+7.77+6.966+11.119)/4 = 8.79125\n\n        Similarly for other hours.\n\n     b. Create a list of the seasonal component for each hour of the day (24 values).\n\n     c. For each time point in the original data, subtract the corresponding seasonal component (based on hour of the day) to get de-seasonalized series.\n\n     d. Fit a linear regression: \n            y = a + b * t\n        where t is the time index (0 to 95).\n\n     e. For forecasting, for time t from 96 to 191, compute:\n            trend_component = a + b * t\n        and then add the seasonal component for the hour corresponding to (t mod 24).\n\n 26. But note: the dates for the forecast are:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-09 00:00:00 (which is the 96th point, index 96, and hour0 of the next day)\n        Then 2017-05-09 01:00:00 (index 97, hour1) ... until 2017-05-12 23:00:00 (index 191, hour23).\n\n 27. We must generate the dates for the next 96 hours.\n\n 28. However, note: the last date in the input is 2017-05-08 23:00:00. The next 96 hours will be:\n\n        2017-05-09 00:00:00\n        2017-05-09 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-05-12 23:00:00\n\n 29. We must output the forecast in the same format: a table with two columns: date and HUFL.\n\n 30. Implementation:\n\n     We'll compute the seasonal component (24 values) by averaging the 4 days for each hour.\n\n     Then, we de-seasonalize the original series.\n\n     Then, we fit a linear regression to the de-seasonalized series.\n\n     Then, we forecast the next 96 points by:\n        For t in [96, 191]:\n            hour_index = (t - 96) % 24   # because the first forecast hour is 00:00:00 (hour0) of 2017-05-09\n            But note: in the seasonal component array, we have index0 for hour0, index1 for hour1, ... index23 for hour23.\n\n        Actually, for the first forecast point (t=96) we want the seasonal component for hour0, which is the first in our array.\n\n        So: \n            seasonal_index = (t) % 24   # because the original data started at hour0 of day1? Actually, the first data point is 2017-05-05 00:00:00 (hour0). \n            For the entire series, the hour of a point at index i is: i mod 24.\n\n        Therefore, for a forecast index t (from 96 to 191), the hour is: t mod 24.\n\n        So we take: seasonal_component[t mod 24]\n\n     Then, the forecast for index t is: \n            forecast = (a + b * t) + seasonal_component[t % 24]\n\n 31. But note: the linear regression was fitted on the de-seasonalized series which was computed from the original data (index 0 to 95). The intercept and slope are for the time index starting at 0.\n\n 32. However, we must be cautious: the de-seasonalized series might have a mean around zero? Not necessarily because the linear trend is included.\n\n 33. Let's do a quick example with the first point:\n\n        t=0: \n            original = 9.31\n            seasonal_component[0] = 8.79125\n            de-seasonalized = 9.31 - 8.79125 = 0.51875\n\n        Then the linear model at t=0: a + b*0 = a, so a should be around 0.51875? But we are fitting a line to the entire de-seasonalized series.\n\n 34. We'll code the steps in Python-like pseudocode, but since we are to output the data, we do the calculations manually? \n\n 35. Given the length, we can compute the seasonal component and the linear regression coefficients.\n\n 36. But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the complete data. We are allowed to use any method, but we must output the next 96 points.\n\n 37. We decide to use the method.\n\n 38. However, note: the data might have missing values in the future? But we are to forecast and we are to provide the complete data. So we are generating 96 points without missing values.\n\n 39. Steps in detail:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the seasonal component (24 values) by averaging the 4 days for each hour.\n\n        Let S = [s0, s1, ..., s23] \n        where for hour i (i from 0 to 23):\n            s_i = (value_day1_hour_i + value_day2_hour_i + value_day3_hour_i + value_day4_hour_i) / 4\n\n     Step 2: Create the de-seasonalized series (for t=0 to 95):\n\n        D[t] = HUFL[t] - S[t mod 24]\n\n     Step 3: Fit a linear regression to D[t] against t (t=0 to 95).\n\n        We can use the formulas:\n\n            b = (n*sum(t*D[t]) - sum(t)*sum(D[t])) / (n*sum(t^2) - (sum(t))^2)\n            a = (sum(D[t]) - b * sum(t)) / n\n\n        where n = 96.\n\n        Let T = [0,1,...,95]\n\n        We need:\n            sum_t = 0+1+...+95 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n            sum_t2 = 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = (95*96*191)/6 =  (95*96*191)/6 = 95*16*191 = 95*3056 = 290320? Let me compute:\n\n                Formula: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for n=95: \n                    = 95*96*191/6 = 95 * 16 * 191 = 95 * 3056 = 290320\n\n            sum_D = sum of D[t] for t=0..95\n            sum_tD = sum_{t=0}^{95} (t * D[t])\n\n        Then:\n            b = (96 * sum_tD - 4560 * sum_D) / (96 * 290320 - 4560^2)\n\n        But note: the denominator = 96 * 290320 - 4560^2 = 27870720 - 20793600 = 7077120\n\n        Then a = (sum_D - b * 4560) / 96\n\n     Step 4: For t from 96 to 191:\n\n            D_hat[t] = a + b * t\n            HUFL_hat[t] = D_hat[t] + S[t mod 24]\n\n     Step 5: Format the dates: starting from 2017-05-09 00:00:00, then add 96 hours.\n\n 40. But note: the last date in the input is 2017-05-08 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-05-09 00:00:00.\n\n 41. We must generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = '2017-05-09 00:00:00'\n        then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 42. However, we are to output the data in the next 96 recorded dates, which are 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 43. We'll compute the seasonal component first.\n\n 44. Let's compute the seasonal component (S) for hour0 (00:00): (9.31 + 7.77 + 6.966 + 11.119) / 4 = (9.31+7.77=17.08; 17.08+6.966=24.046; 24.046+11.119=35.165) -> 35.165/4 = 8.79125\n for hour1 (01:00): (9.176 + 7.167 + 7.703 + 10.583) /4 = (9.176+7.167=16.343; 16.343+7.703=24.046; 24.046+10.583=34.629) -> 34.629/4 = 8.65725\n for hour2 (02:00): (8.64 + 7.971 + 6.765 + 11.186) /4 = (8.64+7.971=16.611; 16.611+6.765=23.376; 23.376+11.186=34.562) -> 34.562/4 = 8.6405\n for hour3 (03:00): (8.372 + 5.894 + 5.961 + 11.186) /4 = (8.372+5.894=14.266; 14.266+5.961=20.227; 20.227+11.186=31.413) -> 31.413/4 = 7.85325\n for hour4 (04:00): (7.435 + 5.961 + 7.368 + 11.253) /4 = (7.435+5.961=13.396; 13.396+7.368=20.764; 20.764+11.253=32.017) -> 32.017/4 = 8.00425\n for hour5 (05:00): (11.788 + 6.899 + 9.042 + 7.703) /4 = (11.788+6.899=18.687; 18.687+9.042=27.729; 27.729+7.703=35.432) -> 35.432/4 = 8.858\n for hour6 (06:00): (10.449 + 7.904 + 9.511 + 9.243) /4 = (10.449+7.904=18.353; 18.353+9.511=27.864; 27.864+9.243=37.107) -> 37.107/4 = 9.27675\n for hour7 (07:00): (4.957 + 4.689 + 7.770 + 9.109) /4 = (4.957+4.689=9.646; 9.646+7.770=17.416; 17.416+9.109=26.525) -> 26.525/4 = 6.63125\n for hour8 (08:00): (-0.402 + -1.474 + 5.693 + 5.693) /4 = (-0.402-1.474=-1.876; -1.876+5.693=3.817; 3.817+5.693=9.51) -> 9.51/4 = 2.3775\n for hour9 (09:00): (-8.105 + -6.162 + 0.804 + 5.224) /4 = (-8.105-6.162=-14.267; -14.267+0.804=-13.463; -13.463+5.224=-8.239) -> -8.239/4 = -2.05975\n for hour10 (10:00): (-9.444 + -8.506 + -1.206 + 5.090) /4 = (-9.444-8.506=-17.95; -17.95-1.206=-19.156; -19.156+5.090=-14.066) -> -14.066/4 = -3.5165\n for hour11 (11:00): (-12.927 + -11.788 + 0.335 + 5.693) /4 = (-12.927-11.788=-24.715; -24.715+0.335=-24.38; -24.38+5.693=-18.687) -> -18.687/4 = -4.67175\n for hour12 (12:00): (-18.018 + -11.521 + -2.344 + 2.880) /4 = (-18.018-11.521=-29.539; -29.539-2.344=-31.883; -31.883+2.880=-29.003) -> -29.003/4 = -7.25075\n for hour13 (13:00): (-17.683001 + -8.372 + -5.492 + 3.952) /4 = (-17.683001-8.372=-26.055001; -26.055001-5.492=-31.547001; -31.547001+3.952=-27.595001) -> -27.595001/4 = -6.89875025\n for hour14 (14:00): (-1.942 + -2.277 + -7.837 + 4.287) /4 = (-1.942-2.277=-4.219; -4.219-7.837=-12.056; -12.056+4.287=-7.769) -> -7.769/4 = -1.94225\n for hour15 (15:00): (-4.287 + 0.067 + -3.952 + 4.555) /4 = (-4.287+0.067=-4.22; -4.22-3.952=-8.172; -8.172+4.555=-3.617) -> -3.617/4 = -0.90425\n for hour16 (16:00): (-2.344 + 0.603 + 1.072 + 4.086) /4 = (-2.344+0.603=-1.741; -1.741+1.072=-0.669; -0.669+4.086=3.417) -> 3.417/4 = 0.85425\n for hour17 (17:00): (1.608 + 4.153 + 3.617 + 6.899) /4 = (1.608+4.153=5.761; 5.761+3.617=9.378; 9.378+6.899=16.277) -> 16.277/4 = 4.06925\n for hour18 (18:00): (5.291 + 6.095 + 5.090 + 6.028) /4 = (5.291+6.095=11.386; 11.386+5.090=16.476; 16.476+6.028=22.504) -> 22.504/4 = 5.626\n for hour19 (19:00): (6.229 + 6.497 + 6.028 + 5.760) /4 = (6.229+6.497=12.726; 12.726+6.028=18.754; 18.754+5.760=24.514) -> 24.514/4 = 6.1285\n for hour20 (20:00): (6.765 + 6.765 + 6.497 + 5.961) /4 = (6.765+6.765=13.53; 13.53+6.497=20.027; 20.027+5.961=25.988) -> 25.988/4 = 6.497\n for hour21 (21:00): (6.095 + 5.894 + 5.760 + 5.023) /4 = (6.095+5.894=11.989; 11.989+5.760=17.749; 17.749+5.023=22.772) -> 22.772/4 = 5.693\n for hour22 (22:00): (5.961 + 5.827 + 7.502 + 5.358) /4 = (5.961+5.827=11.788; 11.788+7.502=19.29; 19.29+5.358=24.648) -> 24.648/4 = 6.162\n for hour23 (23:00): (6.162 + 6.698 + 8.306 + 6.698) /4 = (6.162+6.698=12.86; 12.86+8.306=21.166; 21.166+6.698=27.864) -> 27.864/4 = 6.966\n\n 45. Now, we have S = [8.79125, 8.65725, 8.6405, 7.85325, 8.00425, 8.858, 9.27675, 6.63125, 2.3775, -2.05975, -3.5165, -4.67175, -7.25075, -6.89875025, -1.94225, -0.90425, 0.85425, 4.06925, 5.626, 6.1285, 6.497, 5.693, 6.162, 6.966]\n\n 46. Now, we de-seasonalize the original series:\n\n        D[t] = HUFL[t] - S[t mod 24]\n\n        We'll do this for t=0 to 95.\n\n 47. Then, we fit the linear regression on D[t] for t in [0,95].\n\n        We need:\n            n = 96\n            sum_t = 0+1+...+95 = 4560\n            sum_t2 = 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = 95*96*191/6 = 290320 (as above)\n            sum_D = sum_{t=0}^{95} D[t]\n            sum_tD = sum_{t=0}^{95} t * D[t]\n\n        Then:\n            b = (n * sum_tD - sum_t * sum_D) / (n * sum_t2 - sum_t^2)\n            a = (sum_D - b * sum_t) / n\n\n 48. We compute sum_D and sum_tD:\n\n        This is a lot of computation. We can do it in a table, but we are to do it manually? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write a small program, but since we are to provide the answer, we must do the calculation.\n\n        However, we are an expert and we can use a calculator. But the problem is 96 points. We can do it in a script, but we are to output the answer.\n\n        Given the constraints, we will do the calculation in a program (in our mind) and then report the coefficients.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require us to show the intermediate steps, only the final 96 forecasts.\n\n        We decide to compute the linear regression coefficients.\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n            sum_D = 0\n            sum_tD = 0\n\n            We'll go through each t from 0 to 95:\n\n                D[t] = HUFL[t] - S[t % 24]\n\n            We have the HUFL data and S.\n\n        Example for t=0: \n            HUFL[0] = 9.31, S[0]=8.79125 -> D[0]=9.31-8.79125=0.51875\n        t=1: 9.176 - 8.65725 = 0.51875\n        t=2: 8.64 - 8.6405 = -0.0005\n        t=3: 8.372 - 7.85325 = 0.51875\n        t=4: 7.435 - 8.00425 = -0.56925\n        ... \n\n        This is very time-consuming by hand.\n\n 49. Given the time, we might use an alternative: use the last value of the de-seasonalized series and assume a constant? But that would be naive.\n\n 50. Another idea: use the average of the de-seasonalized series as the constant for the forecast? But that ignores any trend.\n\n 51. We observe that the de-seasonalized series might be stationary? But we don't have enough data.\n\n 52. We can use the mean of the de-seasonalized series for the forecast? \n\n        Let mean_D = average of D[t] for t=0..95.\n\n        Then for any t, D_hat[t] = mean_D.\n\n        Then HUFL_hat[t] = mean_D + S[t mod 24]\n\n 53. This is a constant forecast for the de-seasonalized series.\n\n 54. We compute the mean_D:\n\n        sum_D = sum_{t=0}^{95} D[t] = sum_{t=0}^{95} (HUFL[t] - S[t mod 24])\n\n        = (sum of all HUFL) - (sum of S for each hour repeated 4 times)\n\n        Because S is repeated 4 times (4 days).\n\n        sum of HUFL = we can add up the 96 numbers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can group by hour and note that for each hour i, we have 4 values of HUFL, and we are subtracting S[i] for each of these 4, so:\n\n        sum_D = sum_{i=0}^{23} [ (sum of the 4 HUFL for hour i) - 4 * S[i] ]\n\n        But note: S[i] = (sum of the 4 HUFL for hour i) / 4, so:\n\n        (sum of the 4 HUFL for hour i) = 4 * S[i]\n\n        Therefore, for each hour i: (sum of the 4 HUFL for hour i) - 4 * S[i] = 0.\n\n        So sum_D = 0.\n\n        Then mean_D = 0.\n\n        Then the forecast for the de-seasonalized series is 0.\n\n        Then the forecast for HUFL is simply the seasonal component.\n\n        So for the next 96 hours, we just repeat the seasonal component 4 times.\n\n 55. This is the same as the seasonal naive method using the average of the past 4 days for each hour.\n\n 56. Therefore, we can simply output:\n\n        For 2017-05-09 00:00:00: 8.79125\n        For 2017-05-09 01:00:00: 8.65725\n        ... and so on for the first 24 hours (day1 of forecast)\n\n        Then for 2017-05-10 00:00:00: 8.79125\n        ... and so on.\n\n 57. But note: the seasonal component we computed is the average of the 4 days, so it is the same for each day.\n\n 58. Therefore, the forecast for the next 96 hours is the seasonal component repeated 4 times.\n\n 59. We output:\n\n        date, HUFL\n        2017-05-09 00:00:00, 8.79125\n        2017-05-09 01:00:00, 8.65725\n        2017-05-09 02:00:00, 8.6405\n        2017-05-09 03:00:00, 7.85325\n        2017-05-09 04:00:00, 8.00425\n        2017-05-09 05:00:00, 8.858\n        2017-05-09 06:00:00, 9.27675\n        2017-05-09 07:00:00, 6.63125\n        2017-05-09 08:00:00, 2.3775\n        2017-05-09 09:00:00, -2.05975\n        2017-05-09 10:00:00, -3.5165\n        2017-05-09 11:00:00, -4.67175\n        2017-05-09 12:00:00, -7.25075\n        2017-05-09 13:00:00, -6.89875025\n        2017-05-09 14:00:00, -1.94225\n        2017-05-09 15:00:00, -0.90425\n        2017-05-09 16:00:00, 0.85425\n        2017-05-09 17:00:00, 4.06925\n        2017-05-09 18:00:00, 5.626\n        2017-05-09 19:00:00, 6.1285\n        2017-05-09 20:00:00, 6.497\n        2017-05-09 21:00:00, 5.693\n        2017-05-09 22:00:00, 6.162\n        2017-05-09 23:00:00, 6.966\n\n        Then repeat the same for the next three days.\n\n 60. But note: the last value of the given data is 2017-05-08 23:00:00, so the next day starts at 00:00:00 of 2017-05-09.\n\n 61. We generate 96 points by repeating the 24 seasonal values 4 times.\n\n 62. However, we must format the dates correctly.\n\n 63. We start at '2017-05-09 00:00:00' and go to '2017-05-12 23:00:00'\n\n 64. We output the data in the same format.\n\n 65. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We see up to 6 decimals. We'll output with 6 decimal places for consistency.\n\n 66. We'll round the numbers to 6 decimal places? The original data had 3, but some had 6. We'll output as we computed.\n\n 67. However, the problem says \"complete data\", so we output the numbers as we have.\n\n 68. But note: the seasonal component for hour13 was -6.89875025, we can round to 6 decimals: -6.898750\n\n 69. We'll round to 6 decimal places.\n\n 70. Steps for output:\n\n        We have 4 days: 2017-05-09, 2017-05-10, 2017-05-11, 2017-05-12.\n\n        For each day, we output 24 hours.\n\n        The HUFL values for each hour of the day are fixed as the seasonal component.\n\n 71. Therefore, the forecast is:\n\n        Day1: 2017-05-09: [8.79125, 8.65725, 8.6405, ... , 6.966] -> 24 values\n        Day2: 2017-05-10: same 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-05-11: same\n        Day4: 2017-05-12: same\n\n 72. We output the date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 73. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-05-09 00:00:00, 8.791250\n        2017-05-09 01:00:00, 8.657250\n        2017-05-09 02:00:00, 8.640500\n        2017-05-09 03:00:00, 7.853250\n        2017-05-09 04:00:00, 8.004250\n        2017-05-09 05:00:00, 8.858000\n        2017-05-09 06:00:00, 9.276750\n        2017-05-09 07:00:00, 6.631250\n        2017-05-09 08:00:00, 2.377500\n        2017-05-09 09:00:00, -2.059750\n        2017-05-09 10:00:00, -3.516500\n        2017-05-09 11:00:00, -4.671750\n        2017-05-09 12:00:00, -7.250750\n        2017-05-09 13:00:00, -6.898750\n        2017-05-09 14:00:00, -1.942250\n        2017-05-09 15:00:00, -0.904250\n        2017-05-09 16:00:00, 0.854250\n        2017-05-09 17:00:00, 4.069250\n        2017-05-09 18:00:00, 5.626000\n        2017-05-09 19:00:00, 6.128500\n        2017-05-09 20:00:00, 6.497000\n        2017-05-09 21:00:00, 5.693000\n        2017-05-09 22:00:00, 6.162000\n        2017-05-09 23:00:00, 6.966000\n\n        Then for 2017-05-10 00:00:00: 8.791250, and so on.\n\n 74. We'll generate 96 records.\n\n 75. We must be cautious: the method assumes that the seasonal pattern is stable and there is no trend or residual pattern. Given the data only has 4 days, this is a reasonable simple forecast.\n\n 76. We output in the required format.\n\n 77. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 78. We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\ndate,HUFL\n2017-05-09 00:00:00,8.791250\n2017-05-09 01:00:00,8.657250\n2017-05-09 02:00:00,8.640500\n...
