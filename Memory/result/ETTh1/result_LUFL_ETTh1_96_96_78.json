        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-09 00:00:00 to 2017-05-12 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n 2. Given the data length (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n 3. However, note that the data on 2017-05-12 has an anomaly (very high values at the beginning of the day and then a drop). This might be due to a special event or missing data? But we are told to be aware of missing values, but in the provided data there are no explicit missing values in the given 96 points.\n\n 4. We'll use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline: each forecast is set to the value of the same hour in the previous day (or the same hour in the last available season). Since we have 4 days, we can average the same hour over the past 4 days? But note the anomaly on the 12th.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour for the previous days (excluding the 12th if it's an anomaly) or use the last season (which would be the 12th) but that might be risky.\n\n 6. Since the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are to forecast? But we are generating the forecast. We are only given 96 points without missing values.\n\n 7. We decide to use a simple approach: for each hour in the day (0 to 23) of the next 4 days, we take the average of that hour from the available 4 days. However, the 12th has an anomaly in the first 8 hours. We might want to use the median to be robust? Or we can use the last day (12th) for the pattern of the next day? But the 12th is a Friday? (We don't have the day of week). \n\n 8. Let's check the pattern:\n\n    Day 1 (09): \n        00:00: 1.675, 01:00: 1.767, ... 23:00: 1.797\n\n    Day 2 (10):\n        00:00: 1.706, ... 23:00: 2.010\n\n    Day 3 (11):\n        00:00: 2.102, ... 23:00: 2.163\n\n    Day 4 (12): \n        00:00: 4.325 (anomaly?), 01:00: 3.990, ... 08:00: 1.249 (a big drop) and then the rest of the day is low.\n\n 9. The 12th seems to be an anomaly. We might consider using the first three days (9th, 10th, 11th) to compute the average for each hour and then use that for the next four days? But the problem says to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). However, the next days might be weekend? We don't have context.\n\n10. Given the ambiguity, we can use two methods:\n    Method 1: Use the average of the same hour for the last three days (9th, 10th, 11th) for the next four days (13th to 16th). This ignores the 12th because it's an anomaly.\n    Method 2: Use the 12th as the pattern for the next day? But the 12th is very different day.\n\n11. Since we don't have information about the day of the week, and the 12th of May 2017 was a Friday, then the 13th is Saturday, 14th Sunday, 15th Monday, 16th Tuesday. The pattern on Friday might be different from the weekend? But we don't have data for previous weekends.\n\n12. Actually, we only have 4 days: Tuesday (9th), Wednesday (10th), Thursday (11th), Friday (12th). Then the next 4 days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.\n\n    We don't have historical data for Saturday and Sunday. So we have to rely on the available weekdays? \n\n13. Considering the above, we decide to use the following:\n    - For the weekend (13th and 14th): we don't have direct data. We can use the average of the same hour from the weekdays we have? But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour from the last three days (9th,10th,11th) for the entire forecast period? \n\n    However, note that the 12th (Friday) is the last day we have and it is a weekday, but it is anomalous. So we avoid using it.\n\n14. We'll use the forecast for each hour as the average of that hour from the 9th, 10th, and 11th.\n\n    For example, for hour 00:00: \n        (1.675 + 1.706 + 2.102) / 3 = 1.827666... -> 1.828\n\n    Similarly for other hours.\n\n    Then we repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours). This means the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n15. But note: the 12th (Friday) had a very different pattern. We are ignoring it because it's an anomaly? However, the problem does not to omit any content and we are to forecast the next 96. We are not told that the 12th is an anomaly, but the data shows a spike. Without more context, we stick to the average of the first three days.\n\n16. Alternatively, we can use the median for each hour to avoid the effect of outliers? But in the first three days, we don't have outliers. So we can use the mean.\n\n17. Steps for the forecast:\n\n    Let's create a list of 24 hourly averages from the first three days (72 hours).\n\n    Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n18. However, note that the data on the 12th might be a pattern for Friday? But we are forecasting Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. We don't have Friday pattern for the next week? So we stick to the average of the three weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu).\n\n19. Calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the first three days:\n\n    Hour 0: (1.675, 1.706, 2.102) -> (1.675+1.706+2.102)/3 = 5.483/3 = 1.8277 -> 1.828\n    Hour 1: (1.767, 1.675, 1.949) -> (1.767+1.675+1.949)/3 = 5.391/3 = 1.797\n    ... and so on.\n\n20. We'll compute all 24 hours and then repeat 4 days.\n\n21. But note: the data we are given for the 12th (the last day) has a very different pattern. We are not using it because we are forecasting the next days which are not Fridays? And we don't have a Friday pattern to use for next Friday? But we are only forecasting until Tuesday (the 16th). So we don't need Friday.\n\n22. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (1.675, 1.706, 2.102) -> 1.8277 \u2248 1.828\n    Hour 1: (1.767, 1.675, 1.949) -> (1.767+1.675+1.949)=5.391 -> 1.797\n    Hour 2: (1.645, 1.736, 1.797) -> (1.645+1.736+1.797)=5.178 -> 1.726\n    Hour 3: (1.553, 1.614, 2.010) -> (1.553+1.614+2.010)=5.177 -> 1.7257 \u2248 1.726\n    Hour 4: (1.706, 1.888, 1.919) -> (1.706+1.888+1.919)=5.513 -> 1.8377 \u2248 1.838\n    Hour 5: (2.010, 2.528, 2.559) -> (2.010+2.528+2.559)=7.097 -> 2.3657 \u2248 2.366\n    Hour 6: (2.741, 2.955, 3.046) -> (2.741+2.955+3.046)=8.742 -> 2.914\n    Hour 7: (2.711, 2.955, 2.863) -> (2.711+2.955+2.863)=8.529 -> 2.843\n    Hour 8: (2.498, 2.619, 2.498) -> (2.498+2.619+2.498)=7.615 -> 2.5383 \u2248 2.538\n    Hour 9: (2.376, 2.680, 2.680) -> (2.376+2.680+2.680)=7.736 -> 2.5787 \u2248 2.579\n    Hour 10: (2.863, 2.833, 2.741) -> (2.863+2.833+2.741)=8.437 -> 2.8123 \u2248 2.812\n    Hour 11: (3.076, 2.955, 2.955) -> (3.076+2.955+2.955)=8.986 -> 2.9953 \u2248 2.995\n    Hour 12: (2.284, 2.193, 2.406) -> (2.284+2.193+2.406)=6.883 -> 2.2943 \u2248 2.294\n    Hour 13: (2.437, 2.315, 2.345) -> (2.437+2.315+2.345)=7.097 -> 2.3657 \u2248 2.366\n    Hour 14: (2.315, 2.345, 2.284) -> (2.315+2.345+2.284)=6.944 -> 2.3147 \u2248 2.315\n    Hour 15: (2.376, 2.193, 2.132) -> (2.376+2.193+2.132)=6.701 -> 2.2337 \u2248 2.234\n    Hour 16: (2.284, 2.254, 2.315) -> (2.284+2.254+2.315)=6.853 -> 2.2843 \u2248 2.284\n    Hour 17: (2.589, 2.619, 3.046) -> (2.589+2.619+3.046)=8.254 -> 2.7513 \u2248 2.751\n    Hour 18: (2.589, 2.315, 2.437) -> (2.589+2.315+2.437)=7.341 -> 2.447\n    Hour 19: (2.650, 2.437, 2.254) -> (2.650+2.437+2.254)=7.341 -> 2.447\n    Hour 20: (2.680, 2.559, 2.467) -> (2.680+2.559+2.467)=7.706 -> 2.5687 \u2248 2.569\n    Hour 21: (2.437, 2.528, 2.224) -> (2.437+2.528+2.224)=7.189 -> 2.3963 \u2248 2.396\n    Hour 22: (2.193, 2.132, 2.163) -> (2.193+2.132+2.163)=6.488 -> 2.1627 \u2248 2.163\n    Hour 23: (1.797, 2.010, 2.163) -> (1.797+2.010+2.163)=5.97 -> 1.99\n\n    So the 24-hour pattern (from hour0 to hour23) is:\n    [1.828, 1.797, 1.726, 1.726, 1.838, 2.366, 2.914, 2.843, 2.538, 2.579, 2.812, 2.995, 2.294, 2.366, 2.315, 2.234, 2.284, 2.751, 2.447, 2.447, 2.569, 2.396, 2.163, 1.99]\n\n23. Now, we'll generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this pattern 4 times.\n\n    The last date in the given data is 2017-05-12 23:00:00.\n\n    The next date is 2017-05-13 00:00:00.\n\n    So:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-05-13: \n        00:00:00 -> 1.828\n        01:00:00 -> 1.797\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 1.99\n\n    Day 2: 2017-05-14: same pattern\n    Day 3: 2017-05-15: same pattern\n    Day 4: 2017-05-16: same pattern\n\n24. We must output the data in the same format: two columns \"date\" and \"LUFL\", with the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n25. We'll generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-05-13 00:00:00\n    Then 2017-05-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n26. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n27. Code for generating the dates:\n\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n    start_date = datetime(2017, 13, 5) -> but wait, the last date is 2017-05-12 23:00:00, so next is 2017-05-13 00:00:00.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        base = datetime(2017, 5, 13, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [base + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n28. But note: the input data has the date string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n29. We'll output the data in the same way.\n\n30. However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values in the future? But we are generating the forecast and we are to provide the complete data. So we generate all 96 without missing.\n\n31. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n32. Let's create the list:\n\n    dates = []\n    values = []\n\n    pattern = [1.828, 1.797, 1.726, 1.726, 1.838, 2.366, 2.914, 2.843, 2.538, 2.579, 2.812, 2.995, 2.294, 2.366, 2.315, 2.234, 2.284, 2.751, 2.447, 2.447, 2.569, 2.396, 2.163, 1.99]\n\n    for day in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = base + timedelta(hours=24*day + hour)\n            value = pattern[hour]\n            # format date as string: \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n\n33. But note: the base date is 2017-05-13 00:00:00.\n\n34. We'll output the data in the format as the input.\n\n35. However, note that the input data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n36. Let's check the pattern values we computed: we used 3 decimal places in the calculation? We did, but we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n37. We'll write the output in the required format.\n\n38. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output 96 lines.\n\n39. We'll generate the data and output in the <answer> block.\n\n40. However, note that the 12th of May was a Friday and the 13th is Saturday. We are using the average of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday for Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. This might not capture the weekend pattern? But we don't have weekend data. So it's the best we can do.\n\n41. We proceed.\n\n Let's code the pattern and the dates.\n\n But since we are not coding but writing the output, we'll generate the pattern and then write the 96 lines.\n\n We'll write:\n\n    2017-05-13 00:00:00 1.828\n    2017-05-13 01:00:00 1.797\n    ... \n\n42. We'll generate the dates:\n\n    Day 0: 2017-05-13\n    Day 1: 2017-05-14\n    Day 2: 2017-05-15\n    Day 3: 2017-05-16\n\n43. We'll create the list of dates:\n\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n    base = datetime(2017, 5, 13, 0, 0, 0)\n    for i in range(96):\n        current = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n        date_str = current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        # and the value is pattern[i % 24]\n\n44. But we have the pattern list for 24.\n\n45. Pattern list (index 0 to 23) for the 24 hours.\n\n46. We'll write the data.\n\n However, note: we are to output in the exact format as the input (with the same decimal places). The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n47.

For example, hour0: 1.8277 -> 1.828, hour23: 1.99 -> we wrote 1.990 to keep 3 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places. So we should write 1.990.\n\n However, in the input, we have values like 1.675, 1.767, etc.) so we write 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: 1.99 is 1.990? We can write 1.990 to be consistent.\n\n But in the pattern for hour23 we computed 1.99 -> that is 1.990.\n\n We'll write all with 3 decimal places.\n\n However, we computed:\n\n    hour0: 1.828\n    hour1: 1.797\n    hour2: 1.726\n    ... \n    hour23: 1.990\n\n But note: 1.99 is 1.990? Yes.\n\n But in the calculation for hour23: (1.797+2.010+2.163)=5.97 -> 5.97/3=1.99 -> which is 1.990 when written to 3 decimals.\n\n So we write 1.990.\n\n But in the pattern list we wrote 1.99? We need to format to 3 decimals.\n\n We'll adjust: we'll write each value as a float with 3 decimal places.\n\n How? We can use formatting: \"{:.3f}\".format(x)\n\n But we are writing by hand? We'll write:\n\n    1.828 -> 1.828\n    1.797 -> 1.797\n    1.726 -> 1.726\n    ...\n    1.99 -> 1.990\n\n Actually, 1.99 is 1.990.\n\n We'll write:\n\n    for each value, we format to 3 decimal places.\n\n But in the list above, we have:\n\n    hour0: 1.828 -> 1.828\n    hour1: 1.797 -> 1.797\n    ... \n    hour23: 1.99 -> 1.990\n\n We did that in the example above? For hour23 we wrote 1.990.\n\n But in the list above, we wrote 1.990 for the first day, then 1.990 for the next days.\n\n However, in the example output above, we wrote:\n\n    2017-05-13 23:00:00 1.990   -> but wait, we wrote 1.990? Actually, in the list above we wrote 1.990? \n\n    We wrote: \"2017-05-13 23:00:00 1.990\" -> no, we wrote 1.990? \n\n    Actually, in the text above we wrote: \"1.990\" for the first day? \n\n    But in the pattern list we had 1.99 -> then we wrote 1.990? \n\n    We'll check: in the example output we wrote:\n\n        2017-05-13 23:00:00 1.990\n\n    and similarly for the others.\n\n But wait, in the pattern list we had:\n\n        hour23: 1.99\n\n    and we wrote 1.990? \n\n    Actually, in the example output above we wrote \"1.990\" for the first day? \n\n    We did: \"2017-05-13 23:00:00 1.990\" -> yes.\n\n But note: the value for hour23 is 1.99, which is 1.990 when formatted to 3 decimals.\n\n So we are consistent.\n\n49. We output the 96 lines as above.\n\n50. We must be cautious: the last value of the given data was 2.041 (on 2017-05-12 23:00:00). Our first forecast for 2017-05-13 00:00:00 is 1.828. This is a drop? But that's because the 12th was an anomaly.\n\n51. We are ready.\n",
