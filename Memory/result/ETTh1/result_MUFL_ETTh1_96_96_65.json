        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseFul Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 rows without explicit missing values? \n However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". \n But the provided data does not show any missing value? So we assume that the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data (from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00).\n 2. We must forecast the next 4 days (from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with time series data that might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and we have only 4 days, \n we can use a simple model that captures the daily pattern. However, note that the data also shows some non-stationarity.\n\n Given the constraints (only 96 points and the need to forecast 96 points) and the fact that the data might have missing values (though the provided data doesn't have any), \n we can use an approach that is robust to missing values. But since the provided data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n We can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) or \n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or \n   - A simple method: using the average of the same hour in the past days, possibly with a trend.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. But the provided data must be complete? \n We are only given 96 points without missing values. So we can use the provided data to forecast.\n\n Considering the small data size and the need for a forecast, we can use a seasonal naive method or a more sophisticated model.\n\n But note: the data shows a drop on 2017-03-21 (especially during the day) that is not present in the previous days. \n This might be an anomaly or the start of a trend? \n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have 4 days of history, we can try to capture the daily pattern and adjust for the recent trend.\n\n Proposed method:\n   Step 1: Check for missing values in the provided data? -> There are 96 points, so we assume no missing in the provided 96.\n   Step 2: We can use a model that:\n        - Decomposes the time series into trend and seasonal components.\n        - Then forecast the trend and the seasonal component.\n\n However, with only 4 days, it's hard to get a reliable trend. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   Method 1: Average the same hour of the day for the 4 days and then adjust by the last day's deviation? \n        But the last day (2017-03-21) is very different.\n\n   Method 2: Use the last day (2017-03-21) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n   Method 3: Use a simple exponential smoothing state space model with seasonality (Holt-Winters) but with a small seasonality.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast for 96 points, we choose:\n\n   We will use a seasonal naive approach with a drift (to account for the recent trend) but adjusted by the daily pattern.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2017-03-21 has a significant drop during the day (negative values) which was not present in the previous days. \n   This might be an outlier? But we have to forecast based on the given data.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? \n\n   Since the problem does not specify the method, we choose a simple method:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days (day5 to day8), we do:\n\n        Let the value for hour h on day d (d=5,6,7,8) be:\n\n          base = (value of hour h on day4)   # the last day we have\n\n          # but we see that the pattern is changing? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days for that hour? \n\n        But note: the last day (day4: 2017-03-21) is very different from the previous days. \n\n        We can also consider a weighted average? \n\n        However, without more data, it's hard.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n   We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        avg_h = (day1_h + day2_h + day3_h + day4_h) / 4\n\n   Then we use avg_h for each hour in the next 4 days? \n\n   But that would ignore the trend. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day as the base and then add the average hourly change? \n\n   Given the time, we choose:\n\n        We will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   Why? Because the data shows a daily pattern but the last day has an anomaly. By averaging, we smooth out the anomaly.\n\n   However, the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided data there are none. \n\n   Steps for the method:\n\n        For hour in 0..23:\n            Let values = [ value at that hour on day1, day2, day3, day4 ]\n            Then the forecast for that hour in the next 4 days (for each day) is the mean of these 4 values.\n\n        But note: the data for the same hour might be missing? We are told the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. \n        So we assume that for the provided data we have 4 values for each hour.\n\n        However, if we had missing values, we would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we should handle missing values. \n        But the provided data does not have missing values?\n        So we proceed.\n\n   But wait: the data for 2017-03-21 is very different. For example, at 12:00: \n        day1 (2017-03-18 12:00:00): -0.249\n        day2 (2017-03-19 12:00:00): 3.838\n        day3 (2017-03-20 12:00:00): -2.949\n        day4 (2017-03-21 12:00:00): -8.066\n\n        The average = (-0.249 + 3.838 -2.949 -8.066)/4 = (-7.426)/4 = -1.8565\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, every day at 12:00 we would have -1.8565.\n\n   This might be acceptable? \n\n   However, we note that the data also has a trend? The last day is lower. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last two days? \n\n   But the problem does not specify the method. \n\n   Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we choose the average per hour.\n\n   However, we must generate 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) for the next 4 days.\n\n   The dates will be from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Create a list of 24 hours (0 to 23) and for each hour, compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, for each day, we use the 24 averages in order.\n\n   Example for hour 0: \n        day1: 10.341\n        day2: 10.341 (but wait, day2 at 00:00:00 is 10.341? Actually, day2 at 00:00:00 is 10.341? \n        Let me check:\n\n          2017-03-18 00:00:00  10.341\n          2017-03-19 00:00:00  10.341? Actually, the data for 2017-03-19 00:00:00 is 10.341? \n          But in the data: \n              2017-03-19 00:00:00  10.341 -> same as day1?\n          Actually, no: \n              2017-03-19 00:00:00  10.341 -> that's the same value as 2017-03-18 00:00:00? \n          But wait, the data for 2017-03-19 00:00:00 is 10.341? \n          Actually, the data for 2017-03-19 00:00:00 is 10.341? \n          But looking at the data: \n              2017-03-18 00:00:00  10.341\n              2017-03-19 00:00:00  10.341   -> same value? \n\n          However, 2017-03-20 00:00:00: 8.671\n          2017-03-21 00:00:00: 7.107\n\n        So for hour0: [10.341, 10.341, 8.671, 7.107] -> average = (10.341+10.341+8.671+7.107)/4 = 9.115\n\n        Then for 2017-03-22 00:00:00: 9.115\n        Similarly, 2017-03-23 00:00:00: 9.115, and so on.\n\n   But note: the data for the same hour on consecutive days is changing. The average might smooth out the pattern.\n\n   However, we are not accounting for a downward trend? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? \n\n   But the problem does not specify. \n\n   We choose the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [10.341, 10.341, 8.671, 7.107] -> 9.115\n        hour1: [11.549, 9.879, 8.599, 6.538] -> (11.549+9.879+8.599+6.538)/4 = 9.14125\n        hour2: [10.234, 9.381, 6.787, 7.711] -> (10.234+9.381+6.787+7.711)/4 = 8.52825\n        hour3: [9.097, 9.737, 9.452, 6.823] -> (9.097+9.737+9.452+6.823)/4 = 8.77725\n        hour4: [8.990, 8.599, 8.848, 6.538] -> (8.990+8.599+8.848+6.538)/4 = 8.24375\n        hour5: [9.310, 7.711, 6.112, 6.858] -> (9.310+7.711+6.112+6.858)/4 = 7.49775\n        hour6: [11.265, 6.467, 6.290, 7.214] -> (11.265+6.467+6.290+7.214)/4 = 7.809\n        hour7: [10.021, 8.102, 9.275, 8.315] -> (10.021+8.102+9.275+8.315)/4 = 8.92825\n        hour8: [8.138, 7.462, 5.117, 4.193] -> (8.138+7.462+5.117+4.193)/4 = 6.2275\n        hour9: [1.635, 5.259, 5.650, 1.421] -> (1.635+5.259+5.650+1.421)/4 = 3.49125\n        hour10: [3.340, 4.371, 4.371, -0.249] -> (3.340+4.371+4.371-0.249)/4 = 2.95825\n        hour11: [2.381, 5.330, 1.173, -2.665] -> (2.381+5.330+1.173-2.665)/4 = 1.55475\n        hour12: [-0.249, 3.838, -2.949, -8.066] -> (-0.249+3.838-2.949-8.066)/4 = -1.8565\n        hour13: [1.173, 3.056, 1.883, -13.645] -> (1.173+3.056+1.883-13.645)/4 = -1.88325\n        hour14: [3.696, 3.163, -0.036, -9.666] -> (3.696+3.163-0.036-9.666)/4 = -0.71075\n        hour15: [1.990, 3.553, 2.701, -8.671] -> (1.990+3.553+2.701-8.671)/4 = -0.10675\n        hour16: [2.878, 3.802, 4.335, -4.122] -> (2.878+3.802+4.335-4.122)/4 = 1.72325\n        hour17: [4.726, 5.295, 5.366, 2.630] -> (4.726+5.295+5.366+2.630)/4 = 4.50425\n        hour18: [4.442, 4.584, 5.117, 3.767] -> (4.442+4.584+5.117+3.767)/4 = 4.4775\n        hour19: [4.975, 4.655, 5.437, 5.010] -> (4.975+4.655+5.437+5.010)/4 = 5.01925\n        hour20: [4.655, 4.087, 4.762, 4.762] -> (4.655+4.087+4.762+4.762)/4 = 4.5665\n        hour21: [6.219, 3.944, 6.290, 4.584] -> (6.219+3.944+6.290+4.584)/4 = 5.25925\n        hour22: [5.828, 3.447, 6.538, 6.787] -> (5.828+3.447+6.538+6.787)/4 = 5.65\n        hour23: [8.422, 5.650, 6.254, 7.676] -> (8.422+5.650+6.254+7.676)/4 = 7.0005\n\n   Then the next 4 days (2017-03-22 to 2017-03-25) will have the same 24 values repeated each day.\n\n   So the forecast for:\n        2017-03-22 00:00:00 -> 9.115\n        2017-03-22 01:00:00 -> 9.14125\n        ... and so on.\n\n   But note: the last day in the provided data is 2017-03-21.
