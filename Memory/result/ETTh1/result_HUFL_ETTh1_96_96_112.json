        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided segment, there are no missing entries. We assume the data is complete for the given 96 points.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the requirement for a complete dataset and the fact that we are to provide the next 96 points without omission, we must generate 96 forecasts.\n\n 4. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily seasonality (24 hours cycle) because the pattern repeats every day (e.g., low during the day, higher at night?).\n    - Some non-stationarity (the mean level changes).\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal model. One common approach is to use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). However, without extensive model selection, we can try to use a simple model that captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but given the requirement and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, a statistical model might be more straightforward.\n\n 7. Since we are to provide the forecast without the ability to run extensive backtesting, we will use a simple method: \n    - We can use the last 4 days (96 hours) to compute the average pattern for a day and then adjust by the trend.\n\n 8. However, note that the data does not have a strong trend over the 4 days, but there are variations. We can also consider using an exponential smoothing model with seasonality (ETS) or a seasonal naive method.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we can use a seasonal naive forecast: \n    - The forecast for each hour of the next day (2017-09-26) is the same as the same hour of the previous day (2017-09-25), and similarly for the following days.\n\n 10. But note: the data from 2017-09-25 might be the most recent and similar to the next day. However, we have 4 days of data. We can also average the same hour over the last 4 days to smooth out noise.\n\n 11. Let's do:\n     For each hour h (0 to 23) in the day, the forecast for the next 4 days (so 4 occurrences of each hour) will be the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n\n 12. However, this method ignores any trend. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days for that hour.\n\n 13. Since we are only 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n 14. Steps for the method:\n     - We have 4 days: 2017-09-22, 2017-09-23, 2017-09-24, 2017-09-25.\n     - For hour 00:00:00, we have values: 10.851, 11.588, 11.320, 10.918 -> average = (10.851+11.588+11.320+10.918)/4 = 11.16925\n     - Similarly for hour 01:00:00: 9.645, 11.521, 10.717, 9.444 -> average = (9.645+11.521+10.717+9.444)/4 = 10.33175\n     - ... and so on for each hour.\n\n 15. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same set of 24 hourly averages repeated for 4 days.\n\n 16. But note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the data, the values on 2017-09-25 are not consistently lower or higher than the previous days. So averaging might be acceptable.\n\n 17. However, we want to be cautious: if there is a trend, we might adjust. But with only 4 days, it's hard to determine a trend. We can use a simple average.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-25) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But that might be complex.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n 20. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then, the forecast for:\n     2017-09-26 00:00:00: average of 00:00:00\n     2017-09-26 01:00:00: average of 01:00:00\n     ... \n     2017-09-26 23:00:00: average of 23:00:00\n     and then repeat the same 24 values for 2017-09-27, 2017-09-28, 2017-09-29.\n\n 22. However, note that the pattern might change slightly from day to day. But without more data, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 23. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: (10.851 + 11.588 + 11.320 + 10.918) / 4 = 11.16925\n        hour1: (9.645 + 11.521 + 10.717 + 9.444) / 4 = 10.33175\n        hour2: (11.052 + 10.784 + 10.516 + 11.454) / 4 = 10.9515\n        hour3: (11.588 + 10.449 + 9.846 + 12.391) / 4 = 11.0685\n        hour4: (11.922 + 10.985 + 10.851 + 10.650) / 4 = 11.102\n        hour5: (11.052 + 11.119 + 9.578 + 10.985) / 4 = 10.6835\n        hour6: (11.320 + 11.521 + 10.449 + 11.788) / 4 = 11.2695\n        hour7: (10.717 + 12.860 + 9.846 + 10.382) / 4 = 10.95125\n        hour8: (8.975 + 10.315 + 9.109 + 10.650) / 4 = 9.76225\n        hour9: (5.291 + 7.971 + 4.957 + 6.564) / 4 = 6.19575\n        hour10: (3.818 + 6.631 + 7.100 + 5.894) / 4 = 5.86075\n        hour11: (3.416 + 5.157 + 7.837 + 2.277) / 4 = 4.67175\n        hour12: (-0.536 + 1.808 + 4.086 + -1.608) / 4 = 0.9375\n        hour13: (3.215 + -5.894 + 3.349 + 3.818) / 4 = 1.122\n        hour14: (-0.067 + 3.952 + 4.354 + 2.277) / 4 = 2.629\n        hour15: (-8.707 + 4.019 + 5.023 + 4.421) / 4 = 1.189\n        hour16: (3.416 + 5.559 + 6.363 + 2.612) / 4 = 4.4875\n        hour17: (6.698 + 7.033 + 7.033 + 5.023) / 4 = 6.44675\n        hour18: (7.703 + 6.698 + 6.296 + 7.703) / 4 = 7.100\n        hour19: (8.372 + 6.765 + 6.564 + 7.837) / 4 = 7.3845\n        hour20: (7.368 + 6.162 + 5.961 + 6.966) / 4 = 6.61425\n        hour21: (7.234 + 6.765 + 6.497 + 8.306) / 4 = 7.2005\n        hour22: (8.707 + 8.439 + 7.971 + 7.502) / 4 = 8.15475\n        hour23: (10.784 + 10.248 + 9.980 + 11.588) / 4 = 10.65\n\n 24. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-09-26 to 2017-09-26 23:00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> use the 24 averages above.\n     Day 2: 2017-09-27: same 24 averages.\n     Day 3: 2017-09-28: same 24 averages.\n     Day 4: 2017-09-29: same 24 averages.\n\n 25. But note: the last provided data point is 2017-09-25 23:00:00. The next 96 hours start at 2017-09-26 00:00:00 and end at 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n 26. We must output the data in the same format: \n        date (as string in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS') and the HUFL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 27. However, note: the input has negative values and up to 3 decimal places.\n\n 28. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-26 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n 29. The HUFL values for each hour of the day will be the same for each day (the 24 we computed).\n\n 30. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 31. But note: the method is very simple and may not capture trends or changes. However, without more data or a more model, it is a baseline.\n\n 32. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-26 00:00:00 11.169\n2017-09-26 01:00:00 10.332\n2017-09-26 02:00:00 10.952\n... \n        </answer>\n\n 33. We round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's compute the 24 averages again and round:\n\n        hour0: 11.16925 -> 11.169\n        hour1: 10.33175 -> 10.332\n        hour2: 10.9515 -> 10.952\n        hour3: 11.0685 -> 11.069\n        hour4: 11.102 -> 11.102\n        hour5: 10.6835 -> 10.684\n        hour6: 11.2695 -> 11.270\n        hour7: 10.95125 -> 10.951\n        hour8: 9.76225 -> 9.762\n        hour9: 6.19575 -> 6.196\n        hour10: 5.86075 -> 5.861\n        hour11: 4.67175 -> 4.672\n        hour12: 0.9375 -> 0.938\n        hour13: 1.122 -> 1.122\n        hour14: 2.629 -> 2.629\n        hour15: 1.189 -> 1.189\n        hour16: 4.4875 -> 4.488\n        hour17: 6.44675 -> 6.447\n        hour18: 7.100 -> 7.100\n        hour19: 7.3845 -> 7.385\n        hour20: 6.61425 -> 6.614\n        hour21: 7.2005 -> 7.201\n        hour22: 8.15475 -> 8.155\n        hour23: 10.65 -> 10.650   (because 10.65 is 10.650)\n\n 34. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-26: [11.169, 10.332, 10.952, 11.069, 11.102, 10.684, 11.270, 10.951, 9.762, 6.196, 5.861, 4.672, 0.938, 1.122, 2.629, 1.189, 4.488, 6.447, 7.100, 7.385, 6.614, 7.201, 8.155, 10.650]\n        Day2: 2017-09-27: same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2017-09-28: same\n        Day4: 2017-09-29: same\n\n 35. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 36. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 37. We output the data in the format as specified.\n\n Let's write the first few lines:\n\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00 11.169\n        2017-09-26 01:00:00 10.332\n        2017-09-26 02:00:00 10.952\n        ... until 2017-09-29 23:00:00\n\n 38. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 9, 26, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 39. But we don't need to code, we can write:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-09-26\n        Day 2: 2017-09-27\n        Day 3: 2017-09-28\n        Day 4: 2017-09-29\n\n        For each day, we have 24 hours.\n\n 40. We write the 96 lines.\n\n 41. We note: the last provided date was 2017-09-25 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-09-26 00:00:00.\n\n 42. We output the data.\n\n 43. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output all 96 lines.\n\n 44. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
