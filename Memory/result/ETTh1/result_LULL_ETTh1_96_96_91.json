        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-30 00:00:00 to 2017-07-03 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to predict 96 steps ahead (next 96 hours).\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious in our forecasting method to handle potential non-stationarity and seasonality.\n 3. Given the nature of transformer load data, we can expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly patterns. However, with only 4 days of data, weekly patterns are not evident.\n\n Approach:\n - We will use a time series model that can capture seasonality. Since we have only 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that uses daily seasonality (period=24).\n - Given the small data size, we can use a simple but effective model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n - Alternatively, we can use a model like Prophet which is robust to missing data and handles seasonality well, but note that we have only 4 days of history.\n\n However, note: the data provided is only 4 days. This is a very short history. We must be cautious.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can try:\n   - Using a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the same hour in the previous day. But we have only 4 days, so we can take the last day (2017-07-03) and repeat it? \n     But note: the pattern might change.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour? But the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (2017-07-03) has values that are generally lower (more negative) than the first day? \n But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will use a simple model: \n   - We will decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and then forecast by extending the seasonal pattern and the last trend.\n\n But note: we are only given 4 days. We can use a moving average for the trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n  1. Extract the seasonal component: by averaging each hour over the 4 days.\n  2. The trend: we can take a linear trend over the 4 days? But 4 points (if we take daily average) is too few. Alternatively, we can use the last day's trend? \n  3. Alternatively, we can use the last day's values and adjust by the seasonal component? \n\n However, a simpler approach: \n   - Use the average of the last 24 hours (the last day) as the base and then add the seasonal component from the entire 4 days? \n\n But note: the data might have a downward trend? \n\n Let me compute the daily averages:\n\n  2017-06-30: average of 24 hours: \n      values: [-0.457, -0.426, -0.457, -0.640, -0.487, -0.579, -0.579, -0.396, -0.305, -0.396, -0.366, -0.548, -0.457, -0.579, -0.518, -0.518, -0.670, -0.579, -0.701, -0.670, -0.670, -0.579, -0.579, -0.548]\n      average = -0.540\n\n  2017-07-01: \n      [-0.792, -0.731, -0.731, -0.792, -0.792, -0.670, -0.731, -0.609, -0.396, -0.396, -0.426, -0.487, -0.487, -0.518, -0.548, -0.609, -0.548, -0.518, -0.883, -0.701, -0.701, -0.761, -0.731, -0.883]\n      average = -0.640\n\n  2017-07-02:\n      [-0.853, -0.883, -0.731, -0.579, -0.609, -0.487, -0.518, -0.274, -0.213, -0.152, -0.213, -0.213, -0.244, -0.244, -0.305, -0.548, -0.640, -0.518, -0.518, -0.670, -0.457, -0.457, -0.274, -0.457]\n      average = -0.456\n\n  2017-07-03:\n      [-0.396, -0.457, -0.487, -0.457, -0.487, -0.518, -0.335, -0.183, 0.000, -0.213, -0.396, -0.487, -0.457, -0.366, -0.426, -0.335, -0.335, -0.305, -0.579, -0.579, -0.731, -0.822, -0.822, -0.883]\n      average = -0.456\n\n The daily averages: \n   Day1: -0.540, Day2: -0.640, Day3: -0.456, Day4: -0.456\n\n There is a drop from day1 to day2, then a rise (less negative) on day3 and same on day4. \n\n Since we don't have a clear trend and the last two days are similar, we can assume the level is around -0.456.\n\n How to forecast:\n   We can use the seasonal indices from the 4 days and apply them to the last level.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Calculate the hourly seasonal indices (average for each hour across the 4 days).\n  2. Since the overall level of the last two days is about -0.456, we can adjust the seasonal indices to have a mean of -0.456.\n\n But note: the seasonal indices are computed from the 4 days which have different levels. We can de-seasonalize by removing the daily mean and then average the deviations for each hour.\n\n  Let me denote:\n    Y(t) = level(day) + seasonal(hour) + noise\n\n  We can compute for each day the hourly deviation from the daily mean.\n\n  Then, for each hour (0 to 23) we average the deviations over the 4 days.\n\n  Then for the forecast, we set the daily level to the last day's level (or the average of the last two days) and add the seasonal deviation for that hour.\n\n  However, since the last two days had the same level, we can use -0.456 as the base level.\n\n  Then the value for hour i in the forecast is: base_level + seasonal_deviation[i]\n\n  But note: the base_level is the daily average, and the seasonal_deviation[i] is the average deviation for that hour.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days for each hour? \n\n  Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can also use the average of the last two days for each hour as the forecast for the next day? \n\n  But we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). We can repeat the pattern of the last two days? \n\n  However, the last two days (2017-07-02 and 2017-07-03) are:\n\n      2017-07-02: [-0.853, -0.883, -0.731, -0.579, -0.609, -0.487, -0.518, -0.274, -0.213, -0.152, -0.213, -0.213, -0.244, -0.244, -0.305, -0.548, -0.640, -0.518, -0.518, -0.670, -0.457, -0.457, -0.274, -0.457]\n      2017-07-03: [-0.396, -0.457, -0.487, -0.457, -0.487, -0.518, -0.335, -0.183, 0.000, -0.213, -0.396, -0.487, -0.457, -0.366, -0.426, -0.335, -0.335, -0.305, -0.579, -0.579, -0.731, -0.822, -0.822, -0.883]\n\n  We can take the average of these two days for each hour? \n\n  Then the next 4 days (96 hours) would be 4 repetitions of this averaged day? \n\n  But note: the two days are consecutive and we are forecasting the next 4 days. We don't see a trend? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-07-03) and repeat it 4 times? \n\n  However, the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. \n\n  Considering the requirement for simplicity and the lack of a clear trend, we will use the following:\n\n      We will use the average of the last two days (2017-07-02 and 2017-07-03) for each hour to form a \"typical day\" and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n  Why last two? Because the last two days are more recent and the level is similar.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let D2 = [d2_0, d2_1, ..., d2_23] for 2017-07-02\n      Let D3 = [d3_0, d3_1, ..., d3_23] for 2017-07-03\n\n      Then the typical day: D_typical = (D2 + D3) / 2\n\n      Then the forecast for the next 4 days (starting from 2017-07-04 00:00:00) is:\n          Day1: D_typical\n          Day2: D_typical\n          Day3: D_typical\n          Day4: D_typical\n\n  But note: the last two days might have been weekend? and the next four days might be weekdays? We don't have information about the day of the week.\n\n  However, the data provided is from 2017-06-30 (Friday) to 2017-07-03 (Monday). \n      2017-06-30: Friday\n      2017-07-01: Saturday\n      2017-07-02: Sunday\n      2017-07-03: Monday\n\n  So the last two days are Sunday and Monday. The next four days would be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n  We don't have data for Tuesday to Friday in the history? \n\n  But we have Friday (2017-06-30) and Monday (2017-07-03). \n\n  We could consider:\n\n      Friday: 2017-06-30\n      Monday: 2017-07-03\n\n  And we have Saturday and Sunday in between.\n\n  Since we don't have a Tuesday, we cannot form a typical Tuesday. \n\n  Therefore, the method of averaging the last two days (Sunday and Monday) and repeating for the next four days (Tuesday to Friday) might not be ideal.\n\n  But note: the problem does not to have more data. We must use the available data.\n\n  Alternative: use the entire 4 days to compute the seasonal indices per hour and then set the level to the last day's level? \n\n  Steps:\n\n      Step 1: For each day, compute the daily average: \n          mu0 = -0.540 (Friday)\n          mu1 = -0.640 (Saturday)\n          mu2 = -0.456 (Sunday)\n          mu3 = -0.456 (Monday)\n\n      Step 2: For each hour in the day (0-23), compute the deviation from the daily mean for that day.\n\n          For example, hour0:\n            Friday: -0.457 - (-0.540) = 0.083\n            Saturday: -0.792 - (-0.640) = -0.152\n            Sunday: -0.853 - (-0.456) = -0.397\n            Monday: -0.396 - (-0.456) = 0.060\n\n          Then the deviation for hour0 = (0.083 -0.152 -0.397 +0.060)/4 = -0.1015\n\n      Step 3: Then for the next days, we set the daily level. How to set the daily level? \n          We can use the last day's level (Monday) which is -0.456? \n          Then the forecast for hour0 on Tuesday: level + deviation0 = -0.456 + (-0.1015) = -0.5575\n\n      But we don't seen a trend? \n\n      However, the daily levels: \n          Friday: -0.540\n          Saturday: -0.640\n          Sunday: -0.456\n          Monday: -0.456\n\n      We can take a simple average of the last two days: (-0.456 -0.456)/2 = -0.456? \n\n      But we are forecasting 4 days. We don't know if the level will change? \n\n      We can use the average of the entire history? (-0.540 -0.640 -0.456 -0.456)/4 = -0.523\n\n      But the last two days are higher (less negative) than the first two. \n\n      We can use the last day's level for the next day? Then for Tuesday: level = -0.456, for Wednesday: we don't know.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a moving average? \n\n      Since we have only 4 days, we can use the average of the last two days as the level for the next four days? \n\n      So we set the daily level for the next four days to -0.456.\n\n      Then for each hour i in [0,23] for each day, the forecast is: -0.456 + deviation_i\n\n      But note: the deviations we computed are the average over the 4 days. \n\n      However, the deviations for each hour are fixed.\n\n  Step 4: Compute the deviations for each hour (0-23) and then the forecast for each hour.\n\n  But note: the deviations are computed as the average over 4 days. We have:\n\n        dev_i = ( (Y_i0 - mu0) + (Y_i1 - mu1) + (Y_i2 - mu2) + (Y_i3 - mu3) ) / 4\n\n  Then the forecast for hour i of any future day (with level set to L) is: L + dev_i.\n\n  We set L = -0.456 (the last day's level) for all future days? \n\n  However, we don't know if the level will change. But without a trend, we assume it remains.\n\n  But note: the level on Monday was the same as Sunday. \n\n  Let's compute the deviations:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the deviations from the daily average for the 4 days.\n\n      Then average them.\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n\n      Day1 (Tuesday): [ L + dev0, L + dev1, ... , L + dev23 ]\n      Day2 (Wednesday): same as Day1\n      Day3 (Thursday): same as Day1\n      Day4 (Friday): same as Day1\n\n  But note: we are using the same level for all days. \n\n  Alternatively, we could use the level of the same day of the week? But we don't have enough data for that (only one Monday, one Friday, etc.)\n\n  Given the data limitations, we choose the method of using the last day's level and the average hourly deviations.\n\n  Let's compute the deviations:\n\n      We have 4 days, 24 hours.\n\n      We'll create a 2D array (4 rows, 24 columns) and then compute the mean for each column.\n\n      Then subtract the daily mean from each row.\n\n      Then average the columns.\n\n  Then the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days is: \n        base_level = -0.456 (the last day's average) \n        plus the average deviation for that hour.\n\n  But note: the average of the deviations for a fixed hour might not be zero-mean? Then we are effectively setting the overall average of the forecast day to: \n        base_level + (average of the deviations over 24 hours of the average deviations)\n\n      However, the average of the deviations over 24 hours for a given day is zero? Not exactly, because we are averaging over the 4 days.\n\n      Actually, the average of the deviations (over the 24 hours) for each day is zero? \n\n          For a day, the average of the 24 deviations is:\n              (sum_{i} (Y_i - mu) ) / 24 = (sum_i Y_i - 24 * mu) / 24 = (24*mu - 24*mu)/24 = 0.\n\n      But when we average the deviations for a fixed hour over the 4 days, the average of these 24 deviations (across the day) is not necessarily zero? \n\n      Let S = (1/24) * sum_{i=0}^{23} [ (1/4) * sum_{d=0}^{3} (Y_{d,i} - mu_d) ]\n\n          = (1/24) * (1/4) * [ sum_{d,i} Y_{d,i} - sum_{d} 24 * mu_d ]\n\n          But note: for each day d, sum_i Y_{d,i} = 24 * mu_d, so the term in the bracket is 0.\n\n      Therefore, the average of the 24 deviations (for the 24 hours) of the average deviation vector is 0.\n\n      So the daily average of the forecast day will be base_level.\n\n  Therefore, we can proceed.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      base_level = -0.456\n\n      For hour in 0,1,...,23:\n\n          dev[hour] = ( (Y0[hour] - mu0) + (Y1[hour] - mu1) + (Y2[hour] - mu2) + (Y3[hour] - mu3) ) / 4.0\n\n      Then forecast for that hour = base_level + dev[hour]\n\n      Then repeat this 24-hour pattern for 4 days.\n\n  Let's compute the deviations for each hour:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour index (0 to 23) and compute.\n\n  We'll code it in Python in our thoughts.\n\n  But note: we are to provide the forecast.

But we don't have enough data to model that.\n\n  We'll proceed.\n\n  Let's compute the 24 values:\n\n  We'll do it manually for the first few to check:\n\n      Hour0: \n          d0 = -0.457 - (-0.540) = 0.083\n          d1 = -0.792 - (-0.640) = -0.152\n          d2 = -0.853 - (-0.456) = -0.397\n          d3 = -0.396 - (-0.456) = 0.060\n          avg_dev = (0.083 -0.152 -0.397 +0.060)/4 = (-0.406)/4 = -0.1015 -> -0.102 (rounded to 3 decimals? but we'll do at the end)\n\n      We'll do the calculation and then round at the end.\n\n  We'll write a small program in our mind.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days as the pattern? \n\n  But we have already decided to use the method with deviations and base_level.\n\n  We'll compute all 24:\n\n      We'll create a table.\n\n      But to save time, we can code it in the response.\n\n  However, we are to provide the answer. We'll compute the 24 values and then repeat 4 times.\n\n  We'll do the computation and then output.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we don't need to impute for the history.\n\n  We are ready.\n\n  Steps for the answer:\n\n      Start date: 2017-07-04 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-07-04 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n      The LULL values: 4 repetitions of the 24 values we computed.\n\n  Let's compute the 24 forecast values for one day:\n\n      base_level = -0.456\n\n      mu0 = -0.540\n      mu1 = -0.640\n      mu2 = -0.456\n      mu3 = -0.456\n\n      day0 = [-0.457, -0.426, -0.457, -0.640, -0.487, -0.579, -0.579, -0.396, -0.305, -0.396, -0.366, -0.548, -0.457, -0.579, -0.518, -0.518, -0.670, -0.579, -0.701, -0.670, -0.670, -0.579, -0.579, -0.548]\n      day1 = [-0.792, -0.731, -0.731, -0.792, -0.792, -0.670, -0.731, -0.609, -0.396, -0.396, -0.426, -0.487, -0.487, -0.518, -0.548, -0.609, -0.548, -0.518, -0.883, -0.701, -0.701, -0.761, -0.731, -0.883]\n      day2 = [-0.853, -0.883, -0.731, -0.579, -0.609, -0.487, -0.518, -0.274, -0.213, -0.152, -0.213, -0.213, -0.244, -0.244, -0.305, -0.548, -0.640, -0.518, -0.518, -0.670, -0.457, -0.457, -0.274, -0.457]\n      day3 = [-0.396, -0.457, -0.487, -0.457, -0.487, -0.518, -0.335, -0.183, 0.000, -0.213, -0.396, -0.487, -0.457, -0.366, -0.426, -0.335, -0.335, -0.305, -0.579, -0.579, -0.731, -0.822, -0.822, -0.883]\n\n      We'll compute for each hour:\n\n        hour0: \n            d0 = -0.457 -
