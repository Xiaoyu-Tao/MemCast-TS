        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? We note that the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are to be cautious. However, the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't see any. \n    So for the forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete for the past 96.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not apparent).\n\n 3. We can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality. However, with only 96 points, we are limited.\n\n 4. Given the short history, we can use a simple model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA. But note that the data shows:\n    - A clear daily pattern (temperature drops at night and rises during the day) but with some anomalies (like on 2016-10-20, the temperature drops significantly during the day).\n\n 5. We can also consider using a model that can capture seasonality, such as SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) with a seasonality of 24.\n\n 6. However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA(24) might be challenging because we have only 4 seasons. \n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal model and rely on the daily pattern by including dummy variables for hours? But that would require a regression with 24 variables and we have only 96 points, which is possible.\n\n 8. But note: the problem requires forecasting 96 points, which is exactly 4 days. We can also use a naive method: take the average of the same hour over the 4 days we have and then adjust for any trend? However, the data on 2016-10-20 is very different (much colder). \n\n 9. Since the problem does not specify the model, we have to choose one. We'll use a simple approach: \n    - We observe that the temperature on the last day (2016-10-20) is significantly lower. It might be due to a weather change. \n    - We might assume that the next 4 days will have a similar pattern to the last day? But that might be too cold. Alternatively, we can average the last two days? \n\n 10. However, as an expert, we should use a robust method. We'll use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components. But note: we have only 4 days, so decomposition might not be reliable.\n\n 11. Another idea: use a rolling window of the last 24 hours and then project forward? But that would be naive.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we choose a model that is simple and can be implemented quickly: \n     We will use the last 24 hours (the day of 2016-10-20) as the base pattern and then adjust by the overall level of the last day. But we note that the last day was unusually cold. \n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour, but then we see that the last day is an outlier. We might use the median? \n\n 14. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days:\n\n     Hour 00:00: [19.416, 18.500999, 19.697001, 18.712] -> average = (19.416 + 18.501 + 19.697 + 18.712)/4 = 76.326/4 = 19.0815\n     ... and so on.\n\n 15. But the last day (2016-10-20) is much colder. If we believe that the cold weather will persist, then we should use the pattern of the last day. But if we believe it's an anomaly, we might use the average without the last day? \n\n 16. Without additional context, we can use the entire 4 days to compute the average for each hour. This will smooth out the last day's cold.\n\n 17. However, the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. For the forecast, we are to generate missing values? The problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we might have to impute? But the forecast is for the next 96, which are entirely missing (by definition). \n\n 18. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. That is, for each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 days we have, and then use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps for the next 96 hours (4 days) starting at 2016-10-21 00:00:00:\n\n     Day 1 (2016-10-21): \n        00:00:00: average of 00:00:00 of the 4 days\n        01:00:00: average of 01:00:00 of the 4 days\n        ... until 23:00:00\n\n     Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days? But note: the pattern might change? We are just repeating the same daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 20. But we note that the overall level of the last day was lower. If we average, we are bringing up the last day and bringing down the previous days. \n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-20) as the pattern and then adjust by the difference between the average of the last day and the average of the previous days? \n\n 22. However, the problem does not give us any information about the future, so we assume that the pattern of the next 4 days will be similar to the average of the past 4 days.\n\n 23. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n 24. We note the data:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-10-17 (index 0-23)\n     Day 2: 2016-10-18 (index 24-47)\n     Day 3: 2016-10-19 (index 48-71)\n     Day 4: 2016-10-20 (index 72-95)\n\n 25. We'll create a list for each hour:\n\n     hour0 = [19.416000, 18.500999, 19.697001, 18.712000]\n     hour1 = [19.556000, 18.079000, 19.486000, 18.642000]\n     ... and so on.\n\n 26. Then the forecast for the next 4 days at hour0 will be the mean of hour0, and similarly for other hours.\n\n 27. We'll compute the mean for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 28. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is the repetition of these 24 means for 4 times.\n\n 29. But note: the problem says \"the data will have missing values\", but in the provided data we don't have any. And for the forecast, we are generating the next 96 without missing? \n\n 30. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we generate 96 values.\n\n 31. We'll compute the means:\n\n     Let's do it step by step for the first few hours:\n\n        hour00: [19.416000, 18.500999, 19.697001, 18.712000] -> mean = (19.416+18.501+19.697+18.712)/4 = 76.326/4 = 19.0815\n        hour01: [19.556000, 18.079000, 19.486000, 18.642000] -> (19.556+18.079+19.486+18.642) = 75.763/4 = 18.94075\n        ... \n\n 32. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 33. Then the forecast for:\n\n        2016-10-21 00:00:00: 19.0815\n        2016-10-21 01:00:00: 18.94075\n        ... \n        until 2016-10-21 23:00:00: [mean of hour23]\n\n        then 2016-10-22 00:00:00: 19.0815 (same as hour00)\n        and so on.\n\n 34. We note that the actual data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 35. However, we must be cautious: the last day was cold, so the average we are using might be higher than the actual upcoming day? But without more information, we use the average.\n\n 36. Let's compute the 24 means:\n\n     We'll write a small code in our mind:\n\n        hours = 24\n        means = [0]*24\n        for hour in range(24):\n            values = []\n            for day in range(4):\n                index = day*24 + hour\n                values.append( the OT at that index )\n            means[hour] = round(sum(values)/4, 6)   # to match the original precision\n\n 37. But note: the original data has up to 6 decimal places? Actually, we see 3 decimal places but stored as float. We'll output with 6 decimal places as in the input? The input has 6 decimal places, but the values are at most 3. We'll output with 6.\n\n 38. Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places? But the input has 6. We'll output with 6.\n\n 39. We'll compute the means:\n\n     hour0: (19.416000 + 18.500999 + 19.697001 + 18.712000) / 4 = 76.326000 / 4 = 19.081500\n     hour1: (19.556000 + 18.079000 + 19.486000 + 18.642000) / 4 = 75.763000 / 4 = 18.940750\n     hour2: (19.556000 + 18.290001 + 19.486000 + 18.500999) / 4 = 75.833000 / 4 = 18.958250\n     hour3: (18.712000 + 18.009001 + 19.768000 + 17.657000) / 4 = 74.146001 / 4 = 18.536500\n     hour4: (19.275000 + 18.219999 + 19.837999 + 14.843000) / 4 = 72.175998 / 4 = 18.0439995 -> 18.044000\n     hour5: (19.627001 + 18.079000 + 19.979000 + 14.069000) / 4 = 71.754001 / 4 = 17.938500\n     hour6: (18.361000 + 18.219999 + 19.908001 + 14.843000) / 4 = 71.331000 / 4 = 17.832750\n     hour7: (18.993999 + 17.798000 + 19.768000 + 16.954000) / 4 = 73.513999 / 4 = 18.378500\n     hour8: (18.712000 + 17.868000 + 19.697001 + 17.868000) / 4 = 74.145001 / 4 = 18.536250\n     hour9: (20.049000 + 18.431000 + 20.118999 + 18.009001) / 4 = 76.608000 / 4 = 19.152000\n     hour10: (20.190001 + 19.063999 + 20.823000 + 17.305000) / 4 = 77.382000 / 4 = 19.345500\n     hour11: (19.697001 + 19.486000 + 21.034000 + 17.516001) / 4 = 77.733002 / 4 = 19.433250\n     hour12: (20.612000 + 19.416000 + 21.104000 + 18.290001) / 4 = 79.422001 / 4 = 19.855500\n     hour13: (20.823000 + 19.908001 + 21.174000 + 18.150000) / 4 = 80.055001 / 4 = 20.013750\n     hour14: (20.471001 + 20.471001 + 20.823000 + 14.773000) / 4 = 76.538002 / 4 = 19.134500\n     hour15: (20.823000 + 20.260000 + 20.823000 + 13.085000) / 4 = 74.991000 / 4 = 18.747750\n     hour16: (20.260000 + 20.471001 + 20.893000 + 13.085000) / 4 = 74.709001 / 4 = 18.677250\n     hour17: (20.823000 + 20.962999 + 19.837999 + 12.451000) / 4 = 74.074998 / 4 = 18.518750\n     hour18: (20.330000 + 20.190001 + 19.486000 + 12.733000) / 4 = 72.739001 / 4 = 18.184750\n     hour19: (19.908001 + 19.908001 + 19.416000 + 16.461000) / 4 = 75.693002 / 4 = 18.923250\n     hour20: (20.118999 + 19.627001 + 19.275000 + 15.265000) / 4 = 74.285000 / 4 = 18.571250\n     hour21: (20.118999 + 19.486000 + 19.627001 + 16.601999) / 4 = 75.833999 / 4 = 18.958500\n     hour22: (19.275000 + 19.275000 + 18.712000 + 17.024000) / 4 = 74.286000 / 4 = 18.571500\n     hour23: (18.572001 + 19.556000 + 18.853001 + 16.954000) / 4 = 73.935002 / 4 = 18.483750\n\n 40. Now, we have 24 means. We will repeat this list 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n 41. The next 96 dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-21 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-10-21 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n 42.

Then the OT values: \n        values = []\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                values.append(means[hour])\n\n 44. Then we output in the same format.\n\n 45. We note: the original data has the date as index and two columns: date and 'OT'.
