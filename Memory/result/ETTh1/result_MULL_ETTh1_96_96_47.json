        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are dealing with hourly data and we expect seasonality (daily, and possibly weekly),\n    we have a few options: SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters), or even a simple seasonal naive method.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points, which is 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (next 4 days), we can be limited.\n\n 4. Observing the data: \n    - There is a clear daily pattern: the load is more negative (which might represent higher load) during the day and less negative at night.\n    - The pattern repeats every 24 hours (24 data points).\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal model. Since we have only 4 days, we might not have enough data for a complex model. However, we can try:\n\n    Option 1: Seasonal Naive - use the value from the same time in the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days? \n              However, we are forecasting 4 days ahead, so we can use the last available day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be 24 hours, and we need 96.\n\n    Option 2: We can use a simple moving average with seasonality. But again, we have limited data.\n\n    Option 3: Use an automated model like SARIMA. We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters, but with 96 points and 4 days, the seasonality period is 24.\n\n    However, note: 96 points is very short for a seasonal model with seasonality 24. We have only 4 seasons.\n\n 6. Considering the constraints, we might use a naive seasonal forecast by taking the average of the same hour over the available 4 days and then use that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for naive seasonal:\n      - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 96 hours (which are 4 days), we repeat the computed average pattern for each day.\n\n    But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-01-05: values from -1.031 to -3.376\n        Day 2: 2017-01-06: values from -0.640 to -3.092\n        Day 3: 2017-01-07: values from -1.990 to -2.807 (and one positive 0.178 at 23:00)\n        Day 4: 2017-01-08: values from 0.569 to -2.274\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. The last day (2017-01-08) even has positive values at the beginning.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last season (day 4) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would ignore the average pattern.\n\n    However, the problem says the data has missing values in general, but the provided 96 points are complete. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n    For hour 0: average of [-1.031, -0.640, -1.990, 0.569] = (-1.031 -0.640 -1.990 +0.569)/4 = (-3.092)/4 = -0.773\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n 7. But note: the last day (2017-01-08) has a different pattern? Especially the first few hours are positive. This might be because it's a Sunday? \n    We are not given the day of the week. The data starts on Thursday (2017-01-05) and ends on Sunday (2017-01-08). The next 96 hours would be Monday to Thursday.\n\n    However, we don't have data for Monday in the training. So we are forced to use the available 4 days.\n\n 8. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern 4 times.\n\n 9. Steps:\n    - Extract the hour of the day for each timestamp.\n    - Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n 10. However, we must note that the last day (Sunday) might have a different pattern (weekend). But we are forecasting the next 4 days: \n       2017-01-09 (Monday), 2017-01-10 (Tuesday), 2017-01-11 (Wednesday), 2017-01-12 (Thursday).\n\n     We have in the training: \n        Thursday (2017-01-05), Friday (2017-01-06), Saturday (2017-01-07), Sunday (2017-01-08)\n\n     We don't have a Monday in the training. So we might consider:\n\n        Option: Use the average of the same hour over the 4 days, but note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) might be different.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the average of the weekdays (Thursday and Friday) for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday? \n        But we don't have Monday to Wednesday in the training.\n\n     Given the data, we stick to the average of the 4 days.\n\n 11. Compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0: [ -1.031, -0.640, -1.990, 0.569] -> mean = (-1.092)  [calculated: (-1.031 -0.640 -1.990 +0.569)/4 = (-3.092)/4 = -0.773]\n      hour1: [ -0.569, -1.421, -0.924, -0.107] -> (-0.569 -1.421 -0.924 -0.107)/4 = (-3.021)/4 = -0.75525\n      ... and so on.\n\n 12. Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (Monday, 2017-01-09): \n            00:00:00: -0.773\n            01:00:00: -0.75525\n            ... until 23:00:00\n\n        Day2 (Tuesday): same pattern\n        Day3 (Wednesday): same pattern\n        Day4 (Thursday): same pattern\n\n 13. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are only given 96 complete points. We are forecasting without any missing values.\n\n 14. We must generate 96 timestamps starting from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-01-08 23:00:00) in hourly frequency.\n\n 15. Implementation:\n\n     Step 1: Parse the given data and extract the hour of the day for each record.\n\n     Step 2: Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n     Step 3: Create a list of the 24 hourly averages.\n\n     Step 4: Repeat this list 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n     Step 5: Generate the dates: \n          start_date = last date in the given data (2017-01-08 23:00:00) + 1 hour -> 2017-01-09 00:00:00\n          then 2017-01-09 01:00:00, ... until 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n\n 16. Format the answer as required.\n\n 17. However, note: the data we are given ends at 2017-01-08 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00\n        2017-01-09 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-01-12 23:00:00\n\n 18. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: ( -1.031 + (-0.640) + (-1.990) + 0.569 ) / 4 = (-3.092) / 4 = -0.773\n        hour1: ( -0.569 + (-1.421) + (-0.924) + (-0.107) ) / 4 = (-3.021) / 4 = -0.75525\n        hour2: ( -1.244 + (-1.528) + (-0.604) + (-0.178) ) / 4 = (-3.554) / 4 = -0.8885\n        hour3: ( -0.462 + (-0.817) + (-1.457) + 0.782 ) / 4 = (-1.954) / 4 = -0.4885\n        hour4: ( -0.853 + (-0.924) + (-0.711) + 0.462 ) / 4 = (-2.026) / 4 = -0.5065\n        hour5: ( -0.746 + (-1.386) + (-1.564) + 0.284 ) / 4 = (-3.412) / 4 = -0.853\n        hour6: ( -1.528 + (-1.386) + (-1.883) + (-0.497) ) / 4 = (-5.294) / 4 = -1.3235\n        hour7: ( -1.741 + (-1.777) + (-1.137) + (-0.426) ) / 4 = (-5.081) / 4 = -1.27025\n        hour8: ( -1.492 + (-1.635) + (-0.711) + (-0.497) ) / 4 = (-4.335) / 4 = -1.08375\n        hour9: ( -1.919 + (-1.208) + (-1.528) + (-0.107) ) / 4 = (-4.762) / 4 = -1.1905\n        hour10: ( -0.853 + (-1.066) + (-0.959) + (-0.675) ) / 4 = (-3.553) / 4 = -0.88825\n        hour11: ( -1.741 + (-1.279) + (-0.711) + (-0.497) ) / 4 = (-4.228) / 4 = -1.057\n        hour12: ( -2.559 + (-2.025) + (-1.883) + (-1.492) ) / 4 = (-7.959) / 4 = -1.98975\n        hour13: ( -2.203 + (-1.883) + (-1.670) + (-1.670) ) / 4 = (-7.426) / 4 = -1.8565\n        hour14: ( -1.919 + (-1.528) + (-0.959) + (-1.137) ) / 4 = (-5.543) / 4 = -1.38575\n        hour15: ( -2.025 + (-1.919) + (-1.137) + (-1.564) ) / 4 = (-6.645) / 4 = -1.66125\n        hour16: ( -1.706 + (-2.132) + (-1.386) + (-1.421) ) / 4 = (-6.645) / 4 = -1.66125\n        hour17: ( -1.741 + (-2.239) + (-1.954) + (-1.848) ) / 4 = (-7.782) / 4 = -1.9455\n        hour18: ( -2.345 + (-2.772) + (-2.239) + (-1.883) ) / 4 = (-9.239) / 4 = -2.30975\n        hour19: ( -2.523 + (-2.878) + (-1.741) + (-2.274) ) / 4 = (-9.416) / 4 = -2.354\n        hour20: ( -2.559 + (-3.020) + (-1.954) + (-2.203) ) / 4 = (-9.736) / 4 = -2.434\n        hour21: ( -3.376 + (-3.092) + (-2.807) + (-2.097) ) / 4 = (-11.372) / 4 = -2.843\n        hour22: ( -2.665 + (-1.848) + (-1.386) + (-1.706) ) / 4 = (-7.605) / 4 = -1.90125\n        hour23: ( -1.670 + (-0.711) + 0.178 + (-0.817) ) / 4 = (-3.02) / 4 = -0.755\n\n 19. Now, we create the forecast:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-09): \n            00:00:00 -> hour0: -0.773\n            01:00:00 -> hour1: -0.75525\n            ... until hour23: -0.755\n\n        Day2 (2017-01-10): same 24 values repeated.\n\n        Day3 (2017-01-11): same.\n\n        Day4 (2017-01-12): same.\n\n 20. Format the output: We must output 96 lines, each line: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <value>\", with the value rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 21. However, note: the input has negative values and one positive, and we are averaging so we get negative.\n\n 22. We'll write the dates and the corresponding average for the hour.\n\n 23. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        start_date = pd.Timestamp('2017-01-08 23:00:00') + pd.Timedelta(hours=1)  # 2017-01-09 00:00:00\n        Then generate 96 hours.\n\n 24. But we are not using code, we are writing the output.\n\n 25. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-09 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-01-10 00:00:00 to 2017-01-10 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-01-11 00:00:00 to 2017-01-11 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-01-12 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00\n\n 26. The values for each day are the 24 averages we computed.\n\n 27. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: date and MULL.\n\n 28. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00 -0.773\n        2017-01-09 01:00:00 -0.755\n        2017-01-09 02:00:00 -0.889\n        ... \n\n    We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Rounding the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: -0.773\n        hour1: -0.755\n        hour2: -0.889\n        hour3: -0.489\n        hour4: -0.507\n        hour5: -0.853\n        hour6: -1.324\n        hour7: -1.270\n        hour8: -1.084\n        hour9: -1.191\n        hour10: -0.888\n        hour11: -1.057\n        hour12: -1.990\n        hour13: -1.857\n        hour14: -1.386\n        hour15: -1.661\n        hour16: -1.661\n        hour17: -1.946\n        hour18: -2.310\n        hour19: -2.354\n        hour20: -2.434\n        hour21: -2.843\n        hour22: -1.901\n        hour23: -0.755\n\n 30. Now, we write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 31. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. We output the answer in the required format.\n\n 33. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 34. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-09 00:00:00 -0.773\n2017-01-09 01:00:00 -0.755\n2017-01-09 02:00:00 -0.889\n2017-01-09 03:00:00 -0.489\n2017-01-09 04:00:00 -0.507\n2017-01-09 05:00:00 -0.853\n2017-01-09 06:00:00 -1.324\n2017-01-09 07:00:00 -1.270\n2017-01-09 08:00:00 -1.084\n2017-01-09 09:00:00 -1.191\n2017-01-09 10:00:00 -0.888\n2017-01-09 11:00:00 -1.057\n2017-01-09 12:00:00 -1.990\n2017-01-09 13:00:00 -1.857\n2017-01-09 14:00:00 -1.386\n2017-01-09 15:00:00 -1.661\n2017-01-09 16:00:00 -1.661\n2017-01-09 17:00:00 -1.946\n2017-01-09 18:00:00 -2.310\n2017-01-09 19:00:00 -2.354\n2017-01-09 20:00:00 -2.434\n2017-01-09 21:00:00 -2.843\n2017-01-09 22:00:00 -1.901\n2017-01-09 23:00:00 -0.755\n2017-01-10 00:00:00 -0.773\n2017-01-10 01:00:00 -0.755\n2017-01-10 02:00:00 -0.889\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 35. We'll write the entire 96 lines by repeating the 24 values 4 times.\n\n 36. We note that the last day (2017-01-12) will end at 23:00:00.\n\n 37. Let's generate the dates programmatically in our mind:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-09, hours 0 to 23 -> 24\n        Day2: 2017-01-10, hours 0 to 23 -> 24\n        Day3: 2017-01-11, hours 0 to 23 -> 24\n        Day4: 2017-01-12, hours 0 to 23 -> 24\n\n 38. We output the data.\n\n 39. We must be cautious: the rounding we did is to 3 decimal places. We computed the averages and then rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 40. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places, but the averages might have more. We rounded to 3.\n\n 41. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n 42. Since the problem requires the complete data and we cannot omit, we write all 96 lines.\n\n 43. We'll write the entire block.\n\n 44. But note: the example input has the MULL value without any extra spaces, just the number with a minus if negative.\n\n 45.

We note: the value for hour2 was computed as -0.8885 -> rounded to -0.889? \n        Actually, we rounded to 3 decimal places: \n            -0.8885 -> -0.889 (since 0.8885 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5, so round up: 0.8885 -> 0.889, then negative: -0.889)\n\n        Similarly, hour6: -1.3235 -> -1.324\n\n        hour12: -1.98975 -> -1.990 (because 1.98975: 4th decimal is 7, so round up the 3rd decimal: 1.990)\n\n        hour13: -1.8565 -> -1.857? \n            Actually: 1.8565: the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal: 1.857 -> so -1.857.\n\n        But note: the input data has values like -1.919, which is 3 decimals.\n\n 47. We are confident.\n\n 48. We output the above.\n",
