        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with 24 hours.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided data we have 96 consecutive records without missing values? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete? \n    We are to forecast the next 96, and we must be aware of missing values in the input? \n    But the provided data for the past 96 does not have missing values? \n\n    Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", we must handle missing values in the input. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. So we assume that if there are missing values in the input, \n    we would have to impute them. But in this case, we are given 96 complete points.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a time series model that handles seasonality.\n\n Approach:\n Given the hourly data and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model. \n One common approach is to use the Seasonal Naive method, but that would just repeat the last season (last 24 hours) for the next 4 days? \n However, we note that the pattern might change slightly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonal components. But since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 96 points (4 days), \n we might not have enough data for a complex model.\n\n Another idea: use a simple moving average or seasonal decomposition.\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert. We can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n\n Since the data is limited (only 4 days of history) and we are forecasting 4 days, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal Naive - forecast each hour by the same hour from the previous day. \n   But the last day (2016-10-20) might be different from the previous days? \n\n Option 2: We can average the same hour over the 4 days we have and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n But note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day: \n   2016-10-20: \n        00:00:00  7.636\n        01:00:00  7.770\n        ... \n        23:00:00  9.310\n\n The first day: 2016-10-17: \n        00:00:00 11.052\n        ... \n        23:00:00  5.693\n\n The second day: 2016-10-18: \n        00:00:00 10.516\n        ... \n        23:00:00 11.521\n\n The third day: 2016-10-19: \n        00:00:00 13.396\n        ... \n        23:00:00  7.435\n\n The fourth day: 2016-10-20: \n        00:00:00  7.636\n        ... \n        23:00:00  9.310\n\n We see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. \n\n Given the short history, we might use a model that captures the daily seasonality and a possible trend? \n\n However, note that the data does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days? \n It goes up and down. \n\n Considering the challenge of having only 4 days, we might use the following:\n\n  - We can use the last day (2016-10-20) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? \n\n But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 points (4 days). \n\n Since we are limited by the data, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days for the forecast of the same hour in the next 4 days? \n\n However, that would be too static? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a linear extrapolation for each hour? \n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, I propose:\n\n  We use the average of the last two days for each hour? \n\n  Why last two? Because the last two days might be more representative. \n\n  But note: the problem does not specify the method. \n\n  We are an expert, so we can use a more sophisticated method? \n\n  However, with only 4 days, complex models might not be feasible. \n\n  Let me try to use a seasonal naive with a drift? \n\n  But the problem says there might be missing values, but in the input we don't have any. \n\n  We are to forecast the next 96 points. \n\n  We can do:\n\n      Forecast for hour h of day 5 (2016-10-21) = value of hour h of day 4 (2016-10-20) + (value of hour h of day 4 - value of hour h of day 3) \n      but that would be a naive trend? \n\n  Alternatively, we can compute the average change from day1 to day2, day2 to day3, day3 to day4 for each hour and then add that average change to the last day? \n\n  But that might be too noisy? \n\n  Another idea: use the overall average of the 4 days for each hour? \n\n  Let me calculate the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00:00: (11.052 + 10.516 + 13.396 + 7.636) / 4 = 10.65\n      Hour 01:00: (10.851 + 10.784 + 11.721 + 7.770) / 4 = 10.2815\n      ... \n\n  Then we use that average for each hour for the next 4 days? \n\n  But that would be the same for each day? \n\n  We need 4 days of forecast. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then add a trend component? \n\n  However, without a clear trend, we might just use the average. \n\n  But note: the data on 2016-10-20 is lower than the previous days? \n\n  We can also consider using the last day (2016-10-20) as the base and then adjust by the average daily change? \n\n  However, the problem does not to overcomplicate. \n\n  Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the forecast of that hour for each of the next 4 days. \n\n  Why? \n      - It captures the seasonality.\n      - It smooths out the noise.\n\n  But note: the next 4 days might have a different level? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days? but we only have 4.\n\n  Since we are limited, we use the 4-day average.\n\n  Steps for forecasting:\n\n      For hour h (0 to 23) in the day:\n          Let v_h = (value of hour h on day1 + day2 + day3 + day4) / 4\n\n      Then for the next 4 days (2016-10-21 to 2016-10-24), each day at hour h will be v_h.\n\n  But wait, that would give the same value for the same hour across the 4 forecasted days? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify that we must have variation per day? \n\n  But note: the historical data shows variation per day. \n\n  Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then add a random component? But we are not allowed to invent.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a moving window? \n\n  Given the requirement for simplicity and the fact that we are an expert with limited data, we choose the average method.\n\n  However, let me check: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we don't have any in the input. \n\n  We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points.\n\n  We'll generate the next 96 points (4 days) by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n  How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n      We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00): \n          day1: 11.052, day2: 10.516, day3: 13.396, day4: 7.636 -> average = (11.052+10.516+13.396+7.636)/4 = 10.65\n\n      Similarly for hour 1: (10.851+10.784+11.721+7.770)/4 = 10.2815\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n  Then the forecast for:\n      2016-10-21 00:00:00: 10.65\n      2016-10-21 01:00:00: 10.2815\n      ... \n      and then for 2016-10-22, 2016-10-23, 2016-10-24 we repeat the same 24 numbers.\n\n  But note: the dates must be continuous. The last date in the input is 2016-10-20 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours are:\n\n      2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n  However, is this the best? \n\n  We note that the last day (2016-10-20) is lower than the previous days. So the average might be pulled up by the first three days? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the median? \n\n  But the problem does not specify. \n\n  Considering the short history, we stick to the average.\n\n  Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n      hour0: (11.052 + 10.516 + 13.396 + 7.636) / 4 = 10.65\n      hour1: (10.851 + 10.784 + 11.721 + 7.770) / 4 = 10.2815\n      hour2: (9.846 + 9.980 + 11.922 + 8.573) / 4 = 10.08025\n      hour3: (10.114 + 9.779 + 12.257 + 7.301) / 4 = 9.86275\n      hour4: (10.650 + 9.913 + 11.521 + 7.435) / 4 = 9.87975\n      hour5: (10.784 + 10.717 + 12.927 + 6.497) / 4 = 10.23125\n      hour6: (11.989 + 10.650 + 13.664 + 7.703) / 4 = 11.0015\n      hour7: (11.588 + 10.382 + 12.525 + 9.645) / 4 = 11.035\n      hour8: (9.980 + 6.229 + 11.052 + 7.502) / 4 = 8.69075\n      hour9: (6.430 + 6.564 + 7.301 + 7.167) / 4 = 6.8655\n      hour10: (7.100 + 7.435 + 7.636 + 7.904) / 4 = 7.51875\n      hour11: (7.502 + 7.569 + 8.239 + 7.971) / 4 = 7.82025\n      hour12: (4.689 + 4.823 + 5.492 + 5.090) / 4 = 5.0235\n      hour13: (4.957 + 5.090 + 5.626 + 5.023) / 4 = 5.174\n      hour14: (6.229 + 6.296 + 6.095 + 6.497) / 4 = 6.27925\n      hour15: (6.296 + 5.760 + 6.430 + 6.564) / 4 = 6.2625\n      hour16: (5.894 + 6.028 + 6.564 + 7.301) / 4 = 6.44675\n      hour17: (6.966 + 7.368 + 6.698 + 8.038) / 4 = 7.2675\n      hour18: (6.832 + 6.765 + 6.564 + 6.564) / 4 = 6.68125\n      hour19: (6.497 + 6.296 + 6.631 + 5.827) / 4 = 6.31275\n      hour20: (5.961 + 5.760 + 6.162 + 5.425) / 4 = 5.827\n      hour21: (4.890 + 5.023 + 5.492 + 6.698) / 4 = 5.52575\n      hour22: (4.890 + 9.846 + 5.693 + 8.306) / 4 = 7.18375\n      hour23: (5.693 + 11.521 + 7.435 + 9.310) / 4 = 8.48975\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-10-21 to 2016-10-24) will be:\n\n      Day1 (2016-10-21): [10.65, 10.2815, 10.08025, ... , 8.48975] (24 values)\n      Day2 (2016-10-22): same 24 values\n      Day3 (2016-10-23): same 24 values\n      Day4 (2016-10-24): same 24 values\n\n  But note: the hour22 and hour23 on day2 (2016-10-18) were unusually high? and that might be an outlier? \n  However, we are taking the average so it should be okay.\n\n  We'll generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-21 00:00:00 (next after 2016-10-20 23:00:00)\n      Then 2016-10-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the given data is hourly. \n  The next 96 should be hourly as well? because the input is hourly.\n\n  So we output hourly.\n\n  But wait, the problem says: \"It is subdivided into four mini-datasets, with data sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes.\" \n  But the data we are given is hourly. So we output hourly.\n\n  We must provide the complete data.\n\n  Let's code the output.\n\n  We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n      from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00\n\n  And then assign the average values for the corresponding hour of the day (0 to 23) in the same order.\n\n  We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  However, note: the input has 3 decimal places.\n\n  We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n  Let me recalculate the averages and round:\n\n      hour0: 10.65 -> 10.650\n      hour1: 10.2815 -> 10.282\n      hour2: 10.08025 -> 10.080\n      hour3: 9.86275 -> 9.863\n      hour4: 9.87975 -> 9.880\n      hour5: 10.23125 -> 10.231\n      hour6: 11.0015 -> 11.002\n      hour7: 11.035 -> 11.035\n      hour8: 8.69075 -> 8.691\n      hour9: 6.8655 -> 6.866\n      hour10: 7.51875 -> 7.519\n      hour11: 7.82025 -> 7.820\n      hour12: 5.0235 -> 5.024\n      hour13: 5.174 -> 5.174\n      hour14: 6.27925 -> 6.279\n      hour15: 6.2625 -> 6.263\n      hour16: 6.44675 -> 6.447\n      hour17: 7.2675 -> 7.268\n      hour18: 6.68125 -> 6.681\n      hour19: 6.31275 -> 6.313\n      hour20: 5.827 -> 5.827\n      hour21: 5.52575 -> 5.526\n      hour22: 7.18375 -> 7.184\n      hour23: 8.48975 -> 8.490\n\n  Then the first day of forecast (2016-10-21) will be:\n\n      2016-10-21 00:00:00 10.650\n      2016-10-21 01:00:00 10.282\n      2016-10-21 02:00:00 10.080\n      ... \n\n  And the second day (2016-10-22) will be the same 24 numbers.\n\n  We write 96 lines.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n  We'll write the format as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-21 00:00:00 10.650\n2016-10-21 01:00:00 10.282\n... \n2016-10-24 23:00:00 8.490\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n  But note: the input had the date as index and then the value. We output similarly.\n\n  We must be precise.\n\n  Let's generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-21 00:00:00\n      Then add 1 hour until we have 96 records.\n\n  We'll generate:\n\n      day = 21: hours 0 to 23\n      day = 22: hours 0 to 23\n      day = 23: hours 0 to 23\n      day = 24: hours 0 to 23\n\n  We'll create a list of the 24 values (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n  We'll then assign the dates.\n\n  We output the date and the value (rounded to 3 decimals) in the same format.\n\n  Let's do it.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are not given any in the input. \n  We are only forecasting. We assume the input we are given is complete.\n\n  We output the forecast.\n\n  This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n  If we had more data, we could use a more sophisticated model, but with 4 days, this is reasonable.\n\n  We'll write the answer accordingly.\n",
