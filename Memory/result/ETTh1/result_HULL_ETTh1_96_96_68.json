        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points from 2017-03-30 00:00:00 to 2017-04-02 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that we should be aware of missing values. However, the provided data for the past 96 is complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 timestamps.\n\n 3. We choose a forecasting method. Given the data, we observe:\n    - There is a daily pattern (diurnal variation) and also a possible weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly pattern might not be captured.\n    - The data has both positive and negative values, and zeros.\n\n 4. We can use a simple method like Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, or Prophet. However, note that the data has a clear daily cycle (24 hours). We can use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a seasonal naive method or a more sophisticated model.\n\n 6. Observing the data:\n    - The first day (2017-03-30) and the next days (2017-03-31, 2017-04-01, 2017-04-02) show that March 31 is all zeros? That might be an anomaly or a holiday? But then April 1 and 2 have non-zero values.\n\n 7. Since March 31 is all zeros, it might be an outlier or a special day. We have to decide how to handle it.\n\n 8. We can try to use the last day (2017-04-02) as a pattern for the next days? But note that the pattern of April 1 and 2 are different from March 30.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can average the non-zero days? But we have only 3 non-zero days (March 30, April 1, April 2) and one zero day (March 31).\n\n 10. Considering the data, we might use a model that accounts for the daily seasonality. We have 24 data points per day.\n\n 11. We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component. However, with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be unstable.\n\n 12. Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the previous days (excluding the zero day) for the forecast.\n\n    Steps for the average method:\n    - For each hour (0 to 23) in the forecasted day, we take the average of that hour from the non-zero days (March 30, April 1, April 2).\n\n    But note: \n        March 30: Thursday\n        March 31: Friday (all zeros) -> we skip\n        April 1: Saturday\n        April 2: Sunday\n\n    We are forecasting for:\n        April 3: Monday? Actually, 2017-04-03 is a Monday.\n\n    However, the pattern of the weekend (April 1 and 2) might be different from the weekday (March 30). But we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 13. Given the problem, we have to make a simple forecast. We can use the average of the last two non-zero days (April 1 and 2) and March 30? But note that March 30 is a Thursday and the weekend days might be different.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (April 2) as the pattern for the next days? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n 15. Since we are limited by data, we decide to use the average of the three non-zero days for each hour. However, note that March 31 is zero and we skip it.\n\n    For hour 0: \n        March 30: 2.344, April 1: 2.210, April 2: 0.134 -> average = (2.344+2.210+0.134)/3 = 1.5627\n    For hour 1:\n        March 30: 2.411, April 1: 1.474, April 2: 0.670 -> average = (2.411+1.474+0.670)/3 = 1.5183\n\n    and so on.\n\n 16. But note: the day March 31 is all zeros and we skip it. So we are using 3 days: day0 (March30), day2 (April1), day3 (April2).\n\n 17. However, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would then be:\n        Day1 (April3): the average of the three days for each hour\n        Day2 (April4): same as Day1? \n        Day3 (April5): same\n        Day4 (April6): same\n\n    But that would be repeating the same daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we could use a moving window or exponential smoothing for the daily pattern? But we don't have a trend.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a clear trend (and limited data), we will use the average of the three non-zero days for each hour and repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. However, note that the last day (April 2) ends at 1.808 at 23:00. We are going to start the forecast at April 3 00:00.\n\n 21. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the three non-zero days:\n\n    We have:\n        Day1: 2017-03-30 (Thursday) -> index 0 to 23\n        Day2: 2017-04-01 (Saturday) -> index 24 to 47\n        Day3: 2017-04-02 (Sunday) -> index 48 to 95\n\n    We'll create an array for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [2.344, 2.210, 0.134] -> average = (2.344+2.210+0.134)/3 = 1.5626667\n        hour1: [2.411, 1.474, 0.670] -> (2.411+1.474+0.670)/3 = 1.5183333\n        hour2: [2.210, 1.875, 0.067] -> (2.210+1.875+0.067)/3 = 1.384\n        hour3: [2.478, 2.880, 1.139] -> (2.478+2.880+1.139)/3 = 2.1656667\n        hour4: [2.277, 1.407, 0.067] -> (2.277+1.407+0.067)/3 = 1.2503333\n        hour5: [2.746, 2.947, 0.938] -> (2.746+2.947+0.938)/3 = 2.2103333\n        hour6: [1.808, 2.478, 0.201] -> (1.808+2.478+0.201)/3 = 1.4956667\n        hour7: [2.344, 1.875, 1.005] -> (2.344+1.875+1.005)/3 = 1.7413333\n        hour8: [2.746, 3.014, 1.340] -> (2.746+3.014+1.340)/3 = 2.3666667\n        hour9: [0.335, 2.478, 1.808] -> (0.335+2.478+1.808)/3 = 1.5403333\n        hour10: [0.000, 1.942, 3.483] -> (0.000+1.942+3.483)/3 = 1.8083333\n        hour11: [0.134, 3.215, 4.287] -> (0.134+3.215+4.287)/3 = 2.5453333\n        hour12: [-0.670, 2.545, 3.148] -> (-0.670+2.545+3.148)/3 = 1.6743333\n        hour13: [0.134, 3.952, 4.354] -> (0.134+3.952+4.354)/3 = 2.8133333\n        hour14: [-0.335, 3.014, 3.483] -> (-0.335+3.014+3.483)/3 = 2.054\n        hour15: [-0.067, 2.478, 2.076] -> (-0.067+2.478+2.076)/3 = 1.4956667\n        hour16: [-0.335, 1.541, 0.335] -> (-0.335+1.541+0.335)/3 = 0.5136667\n        hour17: [-0.603, 0.000, -0.804] -> (-0.603+0.000-0.804)/3 = -0.469\n        hour18: [-1.206, -0.469, -0.871] -> (-1.206-0.469-0.871)/3 = -0.8486667\n        hour19: [-1.340, -0.603, -0.536] -> (-1.340-0.603-0.536)/3 = -0.8263333\n        hour20: [-1.474, -0.670, -0.737] -> (-1.474-0.670-0.737)/3 = -0.9603333\n        hour21: [-1.474, -1.340, -1.139] -> (-1.474-1.340-1.139)/3 = -1.3176667\n        hour22: [-0.871, -0.938, 0.067] -> (-0.871-0.938+0.067)/3 = -0.5806667\n        hour23: [0.268, 0.000, 1.808] -> (0.268+0.000+1.808)/3 = 0.692\n\n 22. Then, for each day in the forecast (4 days: April 3,4,5,6) we assign the 24-hour pattern above.\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the provided 96, but for the future we are to provide complete data.\n\n 24. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-03 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-04-06 23:00:00\n\n 25. We will output the data in the same format: two columns, 'date' and 'HULL'.\n\n 26. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 27. However, note: the average might not be the best because the three days are different (Thursday, Saturday, Sunday). But without more data, it's a simple approach.\n\n 28. Alternatively, we could use the median? But the average is acceptable.\n\n 29. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        April 3, 00:00:00 -> 1.563 (rounded from 1.5626667)\n        April 3, 01:00:00 -> 1.518\n        ... and so on.\n\n 30. We'll generate 4 days of the same 24-hour pattern.\n\n 31. Code for the 24 hours (averages rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n        hour0: 1.563\n        hour1: 1.518\n        hour2: 1.384\n        hour3: 2.166\n        hour4: 1.250\n        hour5: 2.210\n        hour6: 1.496\n        hour7: 1.741\n        hour8: 2.367\n        hour9: 1.540\n        hour10: 1.808\n        hour11: 2.545\n        hour12: 1.674\n        hour13: 2.813\n        hour14: 2.054\n        hour15: 1.496\n        hour16: 0.514\n        hour17: -0.469\n        hour18: -0.849\n        hour19: -0.826\n        hour20: -0.960\n        hour21: -1.318\n        hour22: -0.581\n        hour23: 0.692\n\n 32. Then we repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n 33. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-03 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-04-04 00:00:00 to 2017-04-04 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-04-05 00:00:00 to 2017-04-05 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-04-06 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00\n\n 34. We output the data in the required answer format.\n\n 35. However, note: the problem says the data is sampled hourly, so we generate hourly.\n\n 36. We write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate                 HULL\n2017-04-03 00:00:00  1.563\n2017-04-03 01:00:00  1.518\n... for 96 lines\n        </answer>\n\n 37. We must be cautious: the input data has negative values and we are averaging, so we keep the sign.\n\n 38. Let's compute the averages again and round to 3 decimals:\n\n        We'll create a list of the 24 averages (rounded):\n\n        [1.563, 1.518, 1.384, 2.166, 1.250, 2.210, 1.496, 1.741, 2.367, 1.540, 1.808, 2.545, \n         1.674, 2.813, 2.054, 1.496, 0.514, -0.469, -0.849, -0.826, -0.960, -1.318, -0.581, 0.692]\n\n 39. Then for each day in the forecast period, we output the 24 numbers in order.\n\n 40. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017,4,3,0,0,0)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                value = pattern[hour]   # the 24 values for the day\n\n 41. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 42. Since we cannot use code in the final output, we will write the 96 lines.\n\n 43. But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must output 96 lines.\n\n 44. We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  value\n\n 45. We note that the input had 3 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places for positive and negative. We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. However, the input had up to 3 decimal places? Let me check: \n        2.344, 2.411, ... -0.670, 0.134, ... 0.000 -> so 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. We output the numbers with 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. Let's create the 96 lines:\n\n        We have the pattern for 24 hours: \n        pattern = [\n            1.563, 1.518, 1.384, 2.166, 1.250, 2.210, 1.496, 1.741, 2.367, 1.540, 1.808, 2.545,\n            1.674, 2.813, 2.054, 1.496, 0.514, -0.469, -0.849, -0.826, -0.960, -1.318, -0.581, 0.692\n        ]\n\n        Then for 4 days, we repeat the pattern 4 times.\n\n 49. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-04-03\n        Day 2: 2017-04-04\n        Day 3: 2017-04-05\n        Day 4: 2017-04-06\n\n        For each day, we have 24 hours: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n 50. We write the data.\n\n 51. But note: the input data had a header: \"date   HULL\"\n\n 52. We output the header and then the 96 lines.\n\n 53. However, the problem says: \"give me the complete data\", meaning the next 96 dates and the forecasted HULL.\n\n 54. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate   HULL\n2017-04-03 00:00:00  1.563\n2017-04-03 01:00:00  1.518\n...\n2017-04-06 23:00:00  0.692\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 55. But note: the example input had the date as index? We output the date as a string and the value.\n\n 56. We must be careful: the last hour of the last day (2017-04-06 23:00:00) should be 0.692.\n\n 57. Let's write the first 5 and last 5:\n\n        First 5 of April 3:\n            00:00:00 -> 1.563\n            01:00:00 -> 1.518\n            02:00:00 -> 1.384\n            03:00:00 -> 2.166\n            04:00:00 -> 1.250\n\n        Last 5 of April 6:\n            19:00:00 -> -0.826\n            20:00:00 -> -0.960\n            21:00:00 -> -1.318\n            22:00:00 -> -0.581\n            23:00:00 -> 0.692\n\n 58. We output the entire 96 rows.\n\n 59. Since 96 rows is long, we write it in the code below.\n\n 60. But note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we write all 96.\n\n 61. We generate the data as described.\n\n 62. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are not given any in the input. We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n 63. We output the complete 96 points.\n\n 64. We are done.\n\n Let's write the answer.\n",
