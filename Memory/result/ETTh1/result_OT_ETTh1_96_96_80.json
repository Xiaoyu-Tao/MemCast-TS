        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values in the given sample.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a suitable model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency with potential seasonality (daily and weekly), we might consider:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) which can capture both non-seasonal and seasonal patterns.\n   - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n However, note that we only have 4 days of data. This is a very short period to capture weekly seasonality (which would require at least one full week). Therefore, we might focus on daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n Steps in detail:\n   a. Preprocessing: Check for missing values and impute if necessary. In the given data, there are no missing values in the provided 96 points.\n   b. We will decompose the time series to see trend, seasonality, and residuals. But note: with only 4 days, the trend might be weak and seasonality might be daily (24 points per season).\n   c. Model Selection: We choose a model that can handle seasonality. Given the data is hourly and we suspect daily seasonality (period=24), we can use SARIMA with seasonal period 24.\n\n But note: the data is very short (only 4 days) so we have to be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But that would be naive and not capture any trend.\n\n Given the complexity, we are an expert, we can use a model that can handle multiple seasonality? But with only 4 days, we can only capture daily seasonality.\n\n Let's try to use a simple model: Seasonal Naive. But the problem is that we are forecasting 4 days ahead and we only have 4 days of history. We can use the entire first day as the forecast for the next day? But that would be 24 points, and we need 96.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour for the past 4 days? But note: we have 4 days, so we can average each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a constant for each hour and not capture any trend.\n\n Since the data is complex and we are limited by the data, we can use a model that can capture the daily pattern and a possible trend. We can use:\n\n   - Holt-Winters with additive seasonality and a daily season (24 periods).\n\n However, with only 4 days, the model might not be very stable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a linear model with Fourier terms to capture the daily seasonality? But again, with 4 days, we can only have a few Fourier terms.\n\n Given the constraints, we will use a simple method: \n   We will take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then adjust by a linear trend over the entire period? \n\n But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n After careful thought, we decide to use a Seasonal Naive method for the daily pattern, but we note that the data might have a slight trend? Let's look at the data:\n\n   The first day (2017-05-17) starts at 17.3 and ends at 18.2, the next day starts at 18.0 and ends at 18.5, then 18.36 to 17.2, then 17.0 to 20.1.\n\n It's not clear if there is a trend. Also, the temperature seems to have a daily cycle: lower at night and higher during the day.\n\n We can do:\n\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days. Then we use that average as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But this method ignores any trend. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to estimate a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-20) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But that might be too noisy.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have to provide 96 points, we will use:\n\n   Forecast for hour h (where h in 0,1,...,23) for the next 4 days (day 5,6,7,8) is the average of the same hour h from the 4 historical days.\n\n However, note that the data ends at 2017-05-20 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n   Day 5: 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-21 23:00:00\n   Day 6: 2017-05-22 00:00:00 to 2017-05-22 23:00:00\n   Day 7: 2017-05-23 00:00:00 to 2017-05-23 23:00:00\n   Day 8: 2017-05-24 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00\n\n We will compute the average for each hour:\n\n   For hour 0: (17.305000 + 18.009001 + 18.361000 + 17.024000) / 4\n   For hour 1: (16.954000 + 17.445999 + 18.219999 + 17.024000) / 4\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for the same hour might be increasing or decreasing? We are not capturing that.\n\n However, without a clear trend and with only 4 days, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's do it step by step:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour of the day for each record.\n   Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n But note: the data is exactly 4 days, so we have 4 values for each hour (0 to 23).\n\n We can create a DataFrame with columns: hour, and then the 4 values, then take the mean.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? We can also consider using the last day and then adjust by the average daily change? But that might be too complex.\n\n Given the instructions and the need to provide a complete answer, we will use the average per hour.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data? In the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values. So we can compute the average.\n\n However, to be robust, we can use the mean for each hour ignoring any missing values.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We have 96 rows. We can reshape into 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours). Then for each column, compute the mean.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days is the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n So the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n   Day 5: [mean_hour0, mean_hour1, ..., mean_hour23]\n   Day 6: same as Day 5\n   Day 7: same as Day 5\n   Day 8: same as Day 5\n\n But wait, is that reasonable? It assumes that the pattern is the same every day and there is no trend. Given the short history, it's a simple and common approach.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a moving average of the last few days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n We decide to use the average per hour.\n\n Let's compute the means:\n\n   hour0: (17.305000 + 18.009001 + 18.361000 + 17.024000) / 4 = (17.699999 + 17.024000) = 34.723999 / 4 = 8.68099975 -> 17.305+18.009+18.361+17.024 = 70.699, then 70.699/4=17.67475\n   hour1: 16.954+17.446+18.22+17.024 = 69.644, /4=17.411\n   ... we'll compute all 24 means.\n\n We'll do this programmatically in our mind? But we are an AI, so we can simulate.\n\n However, we are to provide the complete data. We must output 96 points.\n\n We can write a small code in our mind to compute the 24 means and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n But note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days, so we can group by the hour.\n\n Let me list the hours:\n\n   Hour 0: [17.305000, 18.009001, 18.361000, 17.024000] -> mean = (17.305+18.009001+18.361+17.024)/4 = 70.699001/4 = 17.67475025\n   Hour 1: [16.954000, 17.445999, 18.219999, 17.024000] -> 16.954+17.446+18.22+17.024 = 69.644, /4=17.411\n   Hour 2: [16.743000, 17.235001, 18.290001, 16.882999] -> 16.743+17.235+18.29+16.883 = 69.151, /4=17.28775\n   Hour 3: [16.601999, 16.532000, 18.009001, 16.180000] -> 16.602+16.532+18.009+16.18 = 67.323, /4=16.83075\n   Hour 4: [15.898000, 17.165001, 16.672001, 17.165001] -> 15.898+17.165+16.672+17.165 = 66.9, /4=16.725\n   Hour 5: [16.250000, 16.813000, 16.743000, 16.108999] -> 16.25+16.813+16.743+16.109 = 65.915, /4=16.47875\n   Hour 6: [15.687000, 16.320999, 16.250000, 16.601999] -> 15.687+16.321+16.25+16.602 = 64.86, /4=16.215\n   Hour 7: [17.868000, 16.391001, 15.758000, 16.320999] -> 17.868+16.391+15.758+16.321 = 66.338, /4=16.5845\n   Hour 8: [19.908001, 16.672001, 16.180000, 17.235001] -> 19.908+16.672+16.18+17.235 = 69.995, /4=17.49875\n   Hour 9: [19.486000, 17.375999, 17.657000, 20.118999] -> 19.486+17.376+17.657+20.119 = 74.638, /4=18.6595\n   Hour 10: [19.908001, 18.923000, 17.587000, 20.541000] -> 19.908+18.923+17.587+20.541 = 76.959, /4=19.23975\n   Hour 11: [18.993999, 20.471001, 18.079000, 21.385000] -> 18.994+20.471+18.079+21.385 = 78.929, /4=19.73225\n   Hour 12: [18.150000, 21.385000, 18.712000, 21.455999] -> 18.15+21.385+18.712+21.456 = 79.703, /4=19.92575\n   Hour 13: [19.205000, 21.808001, 19.979000, 22.159000] -> 19.205+21.808+19.979+22.159 = 83.151, /4=20.78775\n   Hour 14: [21.455999, 23.988001, 20.190001, 22.863001] -> 21.456+23.988+20.19+22.863 = 88.497, /4=22.12425\n   Hour 15: [22.792000, 23.426001, 19.768000, 24.270000] -> 22.792+23.426+19.768+24.27 = 90.256, /4=22.564\n   Hour 16: [23.426001, 25.184000, 19.275000, 24.129000] -> 23.426+25.184+19.275+24.129 = 92.014, /4=23.0035\n   Hour 17: [22.722000, 24.340000, 19.627001, 21.597000] -> 22.722+24.34+19.627+21.597 = 88.286, /4=22.0715\n   Hour 18: [21.315001, 22.018999, 19.697001, 22.018999] -> 21.315+22.019+19.697+22.019 = 85.05, /4=21.2625\n   Hour 19: [20.823000, 21.525999, 19.627001, 21.737000] -> 20.823+21.526+19.627+21.737 = 83.713, /4=20.92825\n   Hour 20: [19.979000, 20.330000, 18.572001, 20.471001] -> 19.979+20.33+18.572+20.471 = 79.352, /4=19.838\n   Hour 21: [19.063999, 19.416000, 17.657000, 20.541000] -> 19.064+19.416+17.657+20.541 = 76.678, /4=19.1695\n   Hour 22: [18.993999, 18.712000, 17.587000, 20.190001] -> 18.994+18.712+17.587+20.19 = 75.483, /4=18.87075\n   Hour 23: [18.219999, 18.500999, 17.235001, 20.118999] -> 18.22+18.501+17.235+20.119 = 74.075, /4=18.51875\n\n Now, we have 24 means.

But 16.725000 is the same as 16.725. But we'll output 6 decimal places.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   for each date, we output: f\"{date} {ot_value:.6f}\"\n\n But note: the original data had trailing zeros? We'll output 6 digits.\n\n However, the example input had:\n\n   17.305000 -> 6 digits.\n\n So we'll do the same.\n\n Let's generate the 96 lines.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   days = [21,22,23,24]\n   means = [17.674750, 17.411000, 17.287750, 16.830750, 16.725000, 16.478750, 16.215000, 16.584500, 17.498750, 18.659500, 19.239750, 19.732250, 19.925750, 20.787750, 22.124250, 22.564000, 23.003500, 22.071500, 21.262500, 20.928250, 19.838000, 19.169500, 18.870750, 18.518750]\n\n   for day in range(21,25):\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date = \"2017-05-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\".format(day=day, hour=hour)\n            ot = means[hour]\n            print(f\"{date} {ot:.6f}\")\n\n But note: the day in the string: we have to format with two digits.\n\n However, 21,22,23,24 are two digits.\n\n We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n But note: the problem says the data is for the next 96 recorded dates. We are generating 96.\n\n We are ready.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n   We interpreted that the provided data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. \n   And we are forecasting without missing values.\n\n We are providing the complete data.\n\n Let's write the answer.\n",
