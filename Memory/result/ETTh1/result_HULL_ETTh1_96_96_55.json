        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, the provided sample is complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can consider:\n    - ARIMA/SARIMA: to capture potential seasonality (daily seasonality of 24 hours).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n    - Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96 forecasts, we must be cautious.\n\n 3. Since the data shows some fluctuations and potential daily patterns, we see that the values are negative and have a range of about -1.8 to 0.9).\n\n 4. We will use a model that can handle seasonality. We note that the seasonality period is 24 (for hourly data with daily pattern).\n\n 5. However, with only 4 days of data, it might be challenging to fit a seasonal model. We might have to use a non-seasonal model or a simple method.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality.\n\n 7. Considering the requirement and the fact that we must provide 96 points, we can use:\n    - A simple approach: use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 8. We can also try to use an AR model with lags up to 24.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are not given any further instructions, we will use a simple method: \n    - We will use the last 4 days to compute the average for each hour of the day and then use that to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for the method:\n    - We have 4 days (96 hours). We can group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for each hour.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will use the average of each corresponding hour.\n\n    Why this method?\n    - It is simple and can capture the daily pattern.\n    - It is robust to short-term fluctuations.\n\n 10. However, note that the data might have a strong daily pattern? Let's check:\n\n      The data for the same hour across days:\n\n      For example, hour 00:00:\n        Day1: -1.674\n        Day2: -0.670\n        Day3: -1.340\n        Day4: -0.871\n\n      Average: (-1.674 -0.670 -1.340 -0.871)/4 = -1.13875\n\n      Similarly, we compute for each hour.\n\n 11. We will create a list of 24 average values (for hour 0 to 23) and then repeat that list 4 times (for the next 4 days).\n\n 12. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-02-09. The next day is 2017-02-10 (starting at 00:00:00).\n\n 13. We generate the dates for the next 96 hours: from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n 14. We must be cautious: the data has a trend? We are not accounting for trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture trend.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last 24 hours? But that would be a naive forecast.\n\n 16. Given the simplicity and the requirement, we will use the hourly average method.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each hour (0 to 23).\n\n   Step 2: We have 4 days of data, so we have 4 observations per hour. We average them.\n\n   Step 3: For the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 17. However, note that the data might have missing values in the future? But we are generating the forecast, so we are not given any future data. We are to generate 96 points.\n\n 18. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'. The date must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 19. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We have 4 days: 2017-02-06, 2017-02-07, 2017-02-08, 2017-02-09.\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n 20. Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1 (2017-02-06): -1.674\n        Day2 (2017-02-07): -0.670\n        Day3 (2017-02-08): -1.340\n        Day4 (2017-02-09): -0.871\n        Average: (-1.674 -0.670 -1.340 -0.871) / 4 = -1.13875\n\n 21. Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: -1.608\n        Day2: -0.737\n        Day3: -1.541\n        Day4: -0.804\n        Average: (-1.608 -0.737 -1.541 -0.804) / 4 = -1.1725\n\n 22. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 23. Then, for the next 4 days (2017-02-10 to 2017-02-13), we assign:\n        Day1 (2017-02-10): from hour0 to hour23: use the 24 averages we computed.\n        Day2 (2017-02-11): same 24 averages\n        Day3 (2017-02-12): same\n        Day4 (2017-02-13): same\n\n 24. This method assumes that the pattern repeats every day and that the average of the past 4 days is the best estimate for the next 4 days.\n\n 25. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 26. Let's code this in our mind:\n\n      We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of 24 values.\n\n      Then, we generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = 2017-02-10 00:00:00\n        then add 1 hour until 96 hours.\n\n 27. We note that 2017-02-10 00:00:00 is the next date after 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We generate the next 96 dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        base = datetime(2017, 2, 10, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [base + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 29. Then, for each date, we take the hour (0 to 23) and assign the corresponding hourly_avg[hour].\n\n 30. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 31. However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all weekdays? 2017-02-06 is Monday, 2017-02-07 Tuesday, 2017-02-08 Wednesday, 2017-02-09 Thursday). The next 4 days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So the pattern might change? But we don't have weekend data. So we stick to the daily average.\n\n 32. We compute the hourly averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (-1.674, -0.670, -1.340, -0.871) -> (-1.674 -0.670 -1.340 -0.871) = -4.555 -> -4.555/4 = -1.13875 -> -1.139 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n      Hour 1: (-1.608, -0.737, -1.541, -0.804) -> (-1.608 -0.737 -1.541 -0.804) = -4.69 -> -4.69/4 = -1.1725 -> -1.173\n      Hour 2: (-1.608, -0.871, -1.608, -1.005) -> (-1.608 -0.871 -1.608 -1.005) = -5.092 -> -5.092/4 = -1.273\n      Hour 3: (-1.541, -1.206, -1.741, -1.139) -> (-1.541 -1.206 -1.741 -1.139) = -5.627 -> -5.627/4 = -1.40675 -> -1.407\n      Hour 4: (-1.541, -1.273, -1.541, -1.206) -> (-1.541 -1.273 -1.541 -1.206) = -5.561 -> -5.561/4 = -1.39025 -> -1.390\n      Hour 5: (-1.608, -1.273, -1.741, -1.407) -> (-1.608 -1.273 -1.741 -1.407) = -6.029 -> -6.029/4 = -1.50725 -> -1.507\n      Hour 6: (-1.541, -1.808, -1.674, -1.139) -> (-1.541 -1.808 -1.674 -1.139) = -6.162 -> -6.162/4 = -1.5405 -> -1.541\n      Hour 7: (-1.474, -1.340, -1.407, -0.737) -> (-1.474 -1.340 -1.407 -0.737) = -4.958 -> -4.958/4 = -1.2395 -> -1.240\n      Hour 8: (-1.072, -1.206, -0.938, -0.134) -> (-1.072 -1.206 -0.938 -0.134) = -3.35 -> -3.35/4 = -0.8375 -> -0.838\n      Hour 9: (-1.273, -0.737, -0.737, -0.737) -> (-1.273 -0.737 -0.737 -0.737) = -3.484 -> -3.484/4 = -0.871\n      Hour 10: (-1.005, -1.072, -0.871, 0.000) -> (-1.005 -1.072 -0.871 +0.000) = -2.948 -> -2.948/4 = -0.737\n      Hour 11: (0.000, -1.139, -0.603, 0.938) -> (0.000 -1.139 -0.603 +0.938) = -0.804 -> -0.804/4 = -0.201\n      Hour 12: (0.268, -1.005, -1.072, 0.067) -> (0.268 -1.005 -1.072 +0.067) = -1.742 -> -1.742/4 = -0.4355 -> -0.436\n      But wait, let me recalc: 0.268 -1.005 = -0.737; -0.737 -1.072 = -1.809; -1.809+0.067 = -1.742 -> -1.742/4 = -0.4355 -> -0.436\n      Hour 13: (-0.938, -1.072, -0.871, 0.201) -> (-0.938 -1.072 -0.871 +0.201) = -2.68 -> -2.68/4 = -0.670\n      Hour 14: (-0.402, -1.206, -0.737, 0.000) -> (-0.402 -1.206 -0.737 +0.000) = -2.345 -> -2.345/4 = -0.58625 -> -0.586\n      Hour 15: (-0.469, -1.072, -0.469, -0.201) -> (-0.469 -1.072 -0.469 -0.201) = -2.211 -> -2.211/4 = -0.55275 -> -0.553\n      Hour 16: (-1.474, -0.603, -0.268, -0.603) -> (-1.474 -0.603 -0.268 -0.603) = -2.948 -> -2.948/4 = -0.737\n      Hour 17: (-1.340, -0.871, -0.335, -0.737) -> (-1.340 -0.871 -0.335 -0.737) = -3.283 -> -3.283/4 = -0.82075 -> -0.821\n      Hour 18: (-1.674, -1.340, -0.335, -1.072) -> (-1.674 -1.340 -0.335 -1.072) = -4.421 -> -4.421/4 = -1.10525 -> -1.105\n      Hour 19: (-0.737, -0.469, -0.067, -0.201) -> (-0.737 -0.469 -0.067 -0.201) = -1.474 -> -1.474/4 = -0.3685 -> -0.369\n      Hour 20: (-0.804, -0.201, 0.000, -0.201) -> (-0.804 -0.201 +0.000 -0.201) = -1.206 -> -1.206/4 = -0.3015 -> -0.302\n      Hour 21: (-0.871, -0.469, -0.134, -0.268) -> (-0.871 -0.469 -0.134 -0.268) = -1.742 -> -1.742/4 = -0.4355 -> -0.436\n      Hour 22: (-1.005, -0.871, -0.469, -0.670) -> (-1.005 -0.871 -0.469 -0.670) = -3.015 -> -3.015/4 = -0.75375 -> -0.754\n      Hour 23: (-1.340, -1.340, -0.603, -1.005) -> (-1.340 -1.340 -0.603 -1.005) = -4.288 -> -4.288/4 = -1.072\n\n 33.
