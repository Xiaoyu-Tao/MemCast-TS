        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided sample is complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, we can use a simple statistical model. However, as an expert, we might consider models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or exponential smoothing that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the data length (only 96 points) and the frequency (hourly with daily seasonality, i.e., seasonality period = 24), we can try to fit a seasonal model. But note: 4 days of data is very short for a seasonal model with 24 periods. We might have to use a simpler model.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal model and rely on the short-term patterns. However, the data clearly shows daily cycles.\n\n 6. Considering the constraints, we can use a naive seasonal approach: for each hour in the day, we take the average of that hour over the available days and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for the naive seasonal forecast:\n    - We have 4 days (from 2017-02-14 to 2017-02-17) of data, each day has 24 hours.\n    - For hour 0 (00:00): average of [-0.995, -2.416, -1.564, -0.355] -> (-0.995 -2.416 -1.564 -0.355)/4 = -1.3325\n    - Similarly for hour 1, 2, ... 23.\n\n    But note: the last day (2017-02-17) has only 24 hours? Actually, we have 96 points: 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n 7. However, this method would produce the same pattern for each of the next 4 days. But the problem is that we don't see a clear trend? The data might have a slight downward trend? Let's check:\n\n    Day1: 2017-02-14: min=-3.092, max=0.036\n    Day2: 2017-02-15: min=-2.736, max=0.178\n    Day3: 2017-02-16: min=-2.594, max=0.000\n    Day4: 2017-02-17: min=-2.701, max=0.000\n\n    The maximum values are decreasing? But the minimums are not consistently decreasing. We might ignore the trend for simplicity.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-02-17) and repeat it 4 times? But that would be too naive.\n\n 9. Given the time and the requirement, we can use a simple average by hour. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided segment there are none. So we can proceed with the average.\n\n 10. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     hour0: ( -0.995, -2.416, -1.564, -0.355 ) -> (-0.995 -2.416 -1.564 -0.355)/4 = -1.3325\n     hour1: ( -0.640, -2.345, -1.954, -0.675 ) -> (-0.640 -2.345 -1.954 -0.675)/4 = -1.4035\n     ... and so on.\n\n 11. Then for the next 4 days (2017-02-18 to 2017-02-21), we assign the average for each hour.\n\n 12. But note: the last date in the input is 2017-02-17 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n 13. However, as an expert, we know that this method ignores any trend and recent changes. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n 14. Another idea: use the average of the last two days for each hour? But we have 4 days, so we can use the entire 4 days.\n\n 15. Given the simplicity and the fact that we must provide an answer, we will use the average by hour over the 4 days.\n\n 16. Compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n 17. Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this average for each day.\n\n 18. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data to capture weekly (only 4 days, which is less than a week). So we stick to daily.\n\n 19. Let's calculate:\n\n     hour0: [ -0.995, -2.416, -1.564, -0.355] -> mean = (-0.995 -2.416 -1.564 -0.355)/4 = -5.33/4 = -1.3325\n     hour1: [ -0.640, -2.345, -1.954, -0.675] -> (-0.640 -2.345 -1.954 -0.675) = -5.614 /4 = -1.4035\n     hour2: [ -0.746, -2.097, -2.025, -0.640] -> (-0.746 -2.097 -2.025 -0.640) = -5.508 /4 = -1.377\n     hour3: [ -1.457, -2.665, -1.777, -0.533] -> (-1.457 -2.665 -1.777 -0.533) = -6.432 /4 = -1.608\n     hour4: [ -1.208, -2.381, -1.670, -0.462] -> (-1.208 -2.381 -1.670 -0.462) = -5.721 /4 = -1.43025\n     hour5: [ -1.102, -2.559, -2.594, -1.315] -> (-1.102 -2.559 -2.594 -1.315) = -7.57 /4 = -1.8925\n     hour6: [ -1.528, -2.168, -2.239, -1.386] -> (-1.528 -2.168 -2.239 -1.386) = -7.321 /4 = -1.83025\n     hour7: [ -1.244, -2.203, -2.061, -1.528] -> (-1.244 -2.203 -2.061 -1.528) = -7.036 /4 = -1.759\n     hour8: [ -1.137, -1.564, -2.061,  0.000] -> (-1.137 -1.564 -2.061 +0.000) = -4.762 /4 = -1.1905\n     hour9: [ -0.569, -1.386, -1.990, -0.995] -> (-0.569 -1.386 -1.990 -0.995) = -4.94 /4 = -1.235\n     hour10: [ -1.315, -0.355, -1.279, -1.208] -> (-1.315 -0.355 -1.279 -1.208) = -4.157 /4 = -1.03925\n     hour11: [ -0.497,  0.036, -0.569, -1.528] -> (-0.497 +0.036 -0.569 -1.528) = -2.558 /4 = -0.6395\n     hour12: [  0.036, -0.711, -0.746, -2.097] -> (0.036 -0.711 -0.746 -2.097) = -3.518 /4 = -0.8795\n     hour13: [ -0.391,  0.178,  0.000, -1.848] -> (-0.391 +0.178 +0.000 -1.848) = -2.061 /4 = -0.51525\n     hour14: [ -1.386, -0.249, -0.178, -0.640] -> (-1.386 -0.249 -0.178 -0.640) = -2.453 /4 = -0.61325\n     hour15: [ -1.635, -0.888, -0.924, -1.812] -> (-1.635 -0.888 -0.924 -1.812) = -5.259 /4 = -1.31475\n     hour16: [ -1.457, -1.457, -2.203, -1.883] -> (-1.457 -1.457 -2.203 -1.883) = -7.000 /4 = -1.75\n     hour17: [ -2.345, -2.168, -1.990, -1.848] -> (-2.345 -2.168 -1.990 -1.848) = -8.351 /4 = -2.08775\n     hour18: [ -3.092, -2.736, -2.416, -2.097] -> (-3.092 -2.736 -2.416 -2.097) = -10.341 /4 = -2.58525\n     hour19: [ -2.559, -2.203, -2.381, -2.274] -> (-2.559 -2.203 -2.381 -2.274) = -9.417 /4 = -2.35425\n     hour20: [ -2.345, -2.239, -2.416, -2.310] -> (-2.345 -2.239 -2.416 -2.310) = -9.31 /4 = -2.3275\n     hour21: [ -2.239, -2.239, -0.746, -2.701] -> (-2.239 -2.239 -0.746 -2.701) = -7.925 /4 = -1.98125\n     hour22: [ -1.599, -2.452, -1.741, -1.883] -> (-1.599 -2.452 -1.741 -1.883) = -7.675 /4 = -1.91875\n     hour23: [ -1.848, -1.990, -0.604, -1.102] -> (-1.848 -1.990 -0.604 -1.102) = -5.544 /4 = -1.386\n\n 20. Now, we create the next 4 days (from 2017-02-18 to 2017-02-21) by repeating these 24 average values for each day.\n\n 21. The dates will be:\n     2017-02-18 00:00:00 -> hour0: -1.3325\n     2017-02-18 01:00:00 -> hour1: -1.4035\n     ... until 2017-02-18 23:00:00: -1.386\n     then 2017-02-19 00:00:00: -1.3325 again, and so on.\n\n 22. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 23. Format: \n        date                MULL\n        2017-02-18 00:00:00 [value]\n        ...\n\n 24. We note that the original data had 4 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 25. However, the input has up to 3 decimal places. So we round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. Let's recalculate and round:\n\n     hour0: -1.3325 -> -1.333\n     hour1: -1.4035 -> -1.404\n     hour2: -1.377 -> -1.377 (exactly, so -1.377)\n     hour3: -1.608 -> -1.608\n     hour4: -1.43025 -> -1.430\n     hour5: -1.8925 -> -1.893\n     hour6: -1.83025 -> -1.830\n     hour7: -1.759 -> -1.759\n     hour8: -1.1905 -> -1.191\n     hour9: -1.235 -> -1.235\n     hour10: -1.03925 -> -1.039\n     hour11: -0.6395 -> -0.640\n     hour12: -0.8795 -> -0.880\n     hour13: -0.51525 -> -0.515\n     hour14: -0.61325 -> -0.613\n     hour15: -1.31475 -> -1.315\n     hour16: -1.75 -> -1.750\n     hour17: -2.08775 -> -2.088\n     hour18: -2.58525 -> -2.585\n     hour19: -2.35425 -> -2.354\n     hour20: -2.3275 -> -2.328\n     hour21: -1.98125 -> -1.981\n     hour22: -1.91875 -> -1.919\n     hour23: -1.386 -> -1.386\n\n 27. But wait, the input had negative values and sometimes positive. We are averaging and getting negative.\n\n 28. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     Start: 2017-02-18 00:00:00, then add 1 hour until 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll create a list of dates:\n\n     from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n     start_date = datetime(2017, 2, 18, 0, 0, 0)\n     then for i in range(96):\n         date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n 30. The MULL value for each hour is the average for (hour % 24) as computed above.\n\n 31. However, note: the input data ends at 2017-02-17 23:00:00, so the next hour is 2017-02-18 00:00:00.\n\n 32. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 33. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are forecasting without gaps. So we output 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 34. We must output in the exact format.\n\n 35. Let's code the output:\n\n     hours_avg = [\n         -1.333, -1.404, -1.377, -1.608, -1.430, -1.893, -1.830, -1.759,\n         -1.191, -1.235, -1.039, -0.640, -0.880, -0.515, -0.613, -1.315,\n         -1.750, -2.088, -2.585, -2.354, -2.328, -1.981, -1.919, -1.386\n     ]\n\n     Then for day in range(4):\n         for hour in range(24):\n             date = (2017, 2, 18 + day, hour)   # but note: February has 28 days in 2017 (non-leap year)\n             Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 36. We have to be careful with the day boundaries.\n\n     Day 0: 2017-02-18\n     Day 1: 2017-02-19\n     Day 2: 2017-02-20\n     Day 3: 2017-02-21\n\n 37. We output 96 lines.\n\n 38. However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places, so we rounded to 3.\n\n 39. But let me double-check the input: \n        -0.995, -0.640, ... -> 3 decimal places.\n\n 40. We output the data in the same format.\n\n 41. We write the answer in the required XML-like tag.\n\n 42. We must not omit any content.\n\n 43. Let's write the output.\n\n 44. Note: We are not using a sophisticated model due to the limited data and the requirement for a complete forecast. This method is simple and common for seasonal data when we have multiple seasons.\n\n 45. We are aware that this method does not account for any trend or recent changes, but with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 46. We output the 96 forecasted values.\n\n 47. We note that the actual values might be different, but this is a forecast.\n\n 48. We write the dates correctly.\n\n Implementation:\n\n     dates = []\n     values = []\n     start = datetime(2017, 2, 18, 0, 0, 0)\n     for i in range(96):\n         hour_of_day = i % 24\n         day_offset = i // 24\n         current_date = start + timedelta(days=day_offset, hours=i % 24 - hour_of_day? Actually, we are iterating by hours, so just add i hours.\n\n         Actually: current_date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n     Then for each i, the value is hours_avg[hour_of_day]\n\n 49. We'll generate the string for each line.\n\n 50. We must format the date as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 51. Example: 2017-02-18 00:00:00\n\n 52. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-18 00:00:00 -1.333\n2017-02-18 01:00:00 -1.404\n... \n2017-02-21 23:00:00 -1.386\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 53. We must have 96 lines.\n\n 54. Let's generate the list of dates and values.\n\n 55. We'll write the code in our mind and then output.\n\n 56. We note: the rounding we did might have small floating point issues, but we rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 57. We output.\n\n 58. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output all 96.\n\n 59. We are ready.\n\n 60. However, note: the input data had a negative value at hour21 on 2017-02-16: -0.746 which is an outlier? But we averaged it. This is acceptable.\n\n 61. We proceed.\n\n 62. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 63. We note: the forecasted values are the same for each day? Yes, because we are using the same daily pattern.\n\n 64. This is a common approach for short-term forecasting when we have multiple seasons and limited data.\n\n 65. We output.\n",
