        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, the load drops during the night and peaks during the day.\n 2. There are missing values in the provided data? Looking at the provided data, there are no explicit missing values in the 96 points. But the note says the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. So we assume the next 96 might have missing? But the instruction says to provide the complete data for the next 96, so we will generate 96 points.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days) and we have 4 days of history, we can use a time series method that captures seasonality.\n\n Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96 points forecast, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (24 hours) as the forecast for the next season. But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? Or use the last day (day 4) as the forecast for the next 4 days? However, note that the pattern might change slightly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) or ARIMA/SARIMA. But with only 4 days, it's hard to fit a complex model.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But the provided 96 points are complete. For the forecast, we are to provide 96 points without missing.\n\n Since the data shows a clear daily pattern, we have 4 days of history, we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the last day (2016-07-12) has a different pattern? For example, the last day has a peak at 23:00 (13.112) which is higher than previous days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-07-12) as the forecast for the next day, and then for the subsequent days, we can use the same pattern? But the problem says to forecast 96 points (4 days). We can use:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-07-13): use the values of 2016-07-12 (the last available day) but adjusted by the average change from the previous days? Or simply use the last day as the first forecast day? \n\n However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n   The first day (2016-07-09): max around 11.727 (at 02:00) and then drops to 6.005 at 09:00, then rises again in the evening to 9.594 at 23:00.\n   The second day: max 10.518 at 01:00, then drops to 5.188 at 14:00, then rises to 7.214 at 23:00.\n   The third day: max 8.990 at 00:00, then drops to 5.224 at 19:00, then rises to 9.026 at 23:00.\n   The fourth day: max 10.341 at 02:00, then drops to 5.508 at 19:00, then rises to 13.112 at 23:00.\n\n The pattern is not exactly the same. The peak at the end of the day on the last day is much higher.\n\n Considering the limited data, we can do:\n\n   We'll use a simple method: for each hour in the next 4 days, we take the average of the same hour in the past 4 days. But note: the last day has a higher peak at 23:00. If we average, we have:\n\n   For hour 00:00: (11.300, 9.737, 8.990, 9.594) -> average = (11.300+9.737+8.990+9.594)/4 = 9.91525\n   For hour 23:00: (9.594, 7.214, 9.026, 13.112) -> average = (9.594+7.214+9.026+13.112)/4 = 9.7365\n\n But the last day at 23:00 was 13.112, so the average might be too low? Alternatively, we can use the last day as the forecast? But the problem says to forecast 4 days.\n\n Another idea: use a weighted average where the most recent day has a higher weight? For example, weight the last day by 0.4, the day before by 0.3, then 0.2, then 0.1.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the method. We are the expert and we must provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   We use a seasonal naive method for the first 24 hours (using the last day, 2016-07-12) and then for the next 3 days, we use the same pattern? But that would be 4 days of the same as 2016-07-12? That might not be ideal.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, but with a drift (trend) adjustment? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n   Since the data is very short, we can see that the last day (2016-07-12) has a higher peak at 23:00. We might assume that the next day will be similar to the last day? And then the following days might be similar? But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\n   We can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days, but then adjust the entire series by the ratio of the last day's average to the overall average? \n\n   However, to keep it simple and given the requirement, we will use the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days.\n\n   Steps for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00):\n        forecast_hour = (D1_hour + D2_hour + D3_hour + D4_hour) / 4\n\n   Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n   But note: the first day of the forecast is 2016-07-13, which is the day after 2016-07-12.\n\n   We have:\n        Day1: 2016-07-09 (Saturday)\n        Day2: 2016-07-10 (Sunday)\n        Day3: 2016-07-11 (Monday)\n        Day4: 2016-07-12 (Tuesday)\n\n   The next 4 days: \n        Day5: 2016-07-13 (Wednesday)\n        Day6: 2016-07-14 (Thursday)\n        Day7: 2016-07-15 (Friday)\n        Day8: 2016-07-16 (Saturday)\n\n   We are not accounting for weekly seasonality because we only have 4 days (less than a week). So we ignore the day of the week.\n\n   Therefore, we compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then assign:\n\n        2016-07-13 00:00:00: average of 00:00 from the 4 days\n        2016-07-13 01:00:00: average of 01:00 from the 4 days\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for 2016-07-14, we use the same set of averages? Yes, because we don't have more than 4 days to capture weekly pattern.\n\n   So we will have 4 days of the same pattern (the average of the 4 historical days).\n\n   But note: the last day (Tuesday) had a higher peak. So the average, we are smoothing that peak. That might be acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing for the same hour? But again, we have only 4 points per hour.\n\n   We'll do the average_hour = [ (h0)/4, (h1)/4, ... (h23)/4 ]\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n        day5: average_hour[0] to average_hour[23]\n        day6: average_hour[0] to average_hour[23]\n        day7: average_hour[0] to average_hour[23]\n        day8: average_hour[0] to average_hour[23]\n\n   But note: the dates must be generated as:\n        Start: 2016-07-13 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-07-12 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-07-13 01:00:00 ... until 2016-07-16 23:00:00.\n\n   How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and take the mean.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        hour0: 00:00: [11.300, 9.737, 8.990, 9.594] -> mean = (11.300+9.737+8.990+9.594)/4 = 9.91525\n        hour1: 01:00: [11.691, 10.518, 8.493, 9.594] -> wait, the second day 01:00 is 10.518? Actually, the data for 2016-07-10 01:00 is 10.518, 2016-07-11 01:00 is 8.493, 2016-07-12 01:00 is 9.594? Actually, the last day 01:00 is 9.594? Let me check:\n\n        The last day (2016-07-12) 01:00:00 is 9.594? Actually, the data for 2016-07-12 01:00:00 is 9.594? The data:\n\n          2016-07-12 00:00:00  9.594\n          2016-07-12 01:00:00  9.594   -> so yes.\n\n        So hour1: [11.691, 10.518, 8.493, 9.594] -> (11.691+10.518+8.493+9.594)/4 = 10.074\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   However, note: the data for the same hour might be at different indices? We have to be careful.\n\n   We can create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n   Let me compute the averages:\n\n        hour0 (00:00): [11.300, 9.737, 8.990, 9.594] -> 9.91525\n        hour1 (01:00): [11.691, 10.518, 8.493, 9.594] -> 10.074\n        hour2 (02:00): [11.727, 9.630, 7.071, 10.341] -> (11.727+9.630+7.071+10.341)/4 = 9.69225\n        hour3 (03:00): [10.945, 8.493, 7.569, 10.163] -> (10.945+8.493+7.569+10.163)/4 = 9.2925\n        hour4 (04:00): [11.300, 8.599, 7.569, 9.523] -> (11.300+8.599+7.569+9.523)/4 = 9.24775\n        hour5 (05:00): [10.838, 8.706, 7.853, 8.919] -> (10.838+8.706+7.853+8.919)/4 = 9.079\n        hour6 (06:00): [10.874, 9.026, 8.138, 8.635] -> (10.874+9.026+8.138+8.635)/4 = 9.16825\n        hour7 (07:00): [6.396, 7.711, 8.173, 6.894] -> (6.396+7.711+8.173+6.894)/4 = 7.2935\n        hour8 (08:00): [8.280, 7.320, 7.249, 6.681] -> (8.280+7.320+7.249+6.681)/4 = 7.3825\n        hour9 (09:00): [6.005, 6.858, 6.645, 6.467] -> (6.005+6.858+6.645+6.467)/4 = 6.49375\n        hour10 (10:00): [6.574, 6.858, 6.787, 6.965] -> (6.574+6.858+6.787+6.965)/4 = 6.796\n        hour11 (11:00): [6.610, 7.604, 7.143, 7.320] -> (6.610+7.604+7.143+7.320)/4 = 7.16925\n        hour12 (12:00): [5.899, 5.579, 5.508, 6.005] -> (5.899+5.579+5.508+6.005)/4 = 5.74775\n        hour13 (13:00): [6.610, 5.508, 5.792, 6.254] -> (6.610+5.508+5.792+6.254)/4 = 6.041\n        hour14 (14:00): [6.823, 5.188, 6.290, 6.467] -> (6.823+5.188+6.290+6.467)/4 = 6.192\n        hour15 (15:00): [6.361, 6.148, 6.361, 6.823] -> (6.361+6.148+6.361+6.823)/4 = 6.42325\n        hour16 (16:00): [6.432, 5.615, 5.721, 6.112] -> (6.432+5.615+5.721+6.112)/4 = 5.970\n        hour17 (17:00): [6.645, 6.290, 5.934, 6.396] -> (6.645+6.290+5.934+6.396)/4 = 6.31625\n        hour18 (18:00): [6.254, 6.396, 5.579, 5.970] -> (6.254+6.396+5.579+5.970)/4 = 6.04975\n        hour19 (19:00): [5.970, 5.792, 5.224, 5.508] -> (5.970+5.792+5.224+5.508)/4 = 5.6235\n        hour20 (20:00): [7.427, 6.858, 6.183, 7.143] -> (7.427+6.858+6.183+7.143)/4 = 6.90275\n        hour21 (21:00): [9.523, 6.396, 6.219, 7.285] -> (9.523+6.396+6.219+7.285)/4 = 7.35575\n        hour22 (22:00): [8.919, 7.000, 6.290, 9.808] -> (8.919+7.000+6.290+9.808)/4 = 8.00425\n        hour23 (23:00): [9.594, 7.214, 9.026, 13.112] -> (9.594+7.214+9.026+13.112)/4 = 9.7365\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day1: 2016-07-13: [9.91525, 10.074, 9.69225, 9.2925, 9.24775, 9.079, 9.16825, 7.2935, 7.3825, 6.49375, 6.796, 7.16925, 5.74775, 6.041, 6.192, 6.42325, 5.970, 6.31625, 6.04975, 5.6235, 6.90275, 7.35575, 8.00425, 9.7365]\n        Day2: 2016-07-14: same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2016-07-15: same\n        Day4: 2016-07-16: same\n\n   But note: the last day of the history (2016-07-12) had a very high value at 23:00 (13.112).

In practice, more sophisticated methods (like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing) might be used, but with only 4 days of data, it's challenging. We assume that the average over the 4 days is representative for the next 4 days.\n\n   We are aware that the last day had a higher peak, but we are smoothing it by averaging. This might be acceptable if the peak was an anomaly, or if the pattern is consistent on average.\n\n   We output the complete 96 points.\n\n   We have 24 points per day * 4 days = 96 points.\n\n   We are done.\n",
