        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data for the past 96 dates does not have missing values in the given sample, but the problem states that the data will have missing values. However, the provided sample does not show any missing value. \n    Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", we must handle missing values in the input. But in the given 96 points, there are no missing values.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the apparent fluctuations, \n    we might consider a model that captures:\n    - Trend: The data has a daily pattern? Let's look: \n        On 2016-11-18: values between 5.827 and 12.056\n        On 2016-11-19: 5.090 to 17.013\n        On 2016-11-20: 5.023 to 9.310\n        On 2016-11-21: 5.961 to 13.597\n    There is a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also some level of non-stationarity.\n\n 3. We can use models like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) to forecast 96 points (next 4 days). This is a very short history for a seasonal model with 24 periods.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a model. But note: the problem does not require the model details, only the forecast.\n\n 6. We must be cautious: the data has missing values? In the provided 96 points, we don't see any. So we assume the input is complete for the given 96.\n\n 7. We will use an automated approach to model the time series and forecast. Since we are in a simulated environment, we can use a simple model.\n\n 8. We choose to use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline? But the data does not look exactly repeating. Alternatively, we can use ETS or SARIMA.\n\n 9. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values. But in the provided 96, there are none. So we proceed without imputation for the given data.\n\n 10. We will use the `statsmodels` library to fit a seasonal ARIMA model. But note: we are not actually running code, so we have to simulate the output.\n\n 11. Since we cannot run code, we have to generate a plausible forecast. We can use a simple method: \n      - Compute the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n      But the data shows some trend? Let's see:\n\n      For example, at hour 00:00: \n        2016-11-18 00:00:00: 9.846\n        2016-11-19 00:00:00: 15.740\n        2016-11-20 00:00:00: 8.774\n        2016-11-21 00:00:00: 12.927\n\n      The average for 00:00: (9.846+15.740+8.774+12.927)/4 = 11.57175\n\n      Then we would forecast 2016-11-22 00:00:00 as 11.57175? But we have 4 days, so we can use the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 12. However, the data does not be stationary. We see that the level of the time series is changing. We might also consider a moving average of the same hour over the last 4 days.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model that can capture the seasonality and trend. But without running code, we have to approximate.\n\n 14. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by taking the average of each hour across the 4 available days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 15. Steps for generating the forecast = []\n      For hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n          values = [value at that hour from day1, day2, day3, day4]\n          average = mean(values)\n          Then for the next 4 days, at that hour we set the forecast to the average.\n\n 16. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not given any in the input, so we assume the input is complete.\n\n 17. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", meaning in the future? But we are only forecasting. We are not given missing values in the input.\n\n 18. We generate the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the hourly averages computed from the 4 days we have.\n\n 19. But wait, what if there is a trend? We don't have enough data to model a long-term trend. We only have 4 days. So we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n 20. We compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (9.846 + 15.740 + 8.774 + 12.927) / 4 = 11.57175\n        hour1: (9.176 + 17.013 + 6.028 + 13.463) / 4 = 11.42000\n        ... and so on.\n\n 21. Then for the next 4 days (2016-11-22 to 2016-11-25) we assign the hour0 average to 2016-11-22 00:00:00, hour1 to 2016-11-22 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n 22. However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (less than a week). So we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 23. We'll proceed with the daily seasonality.\n\n 24. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n 25. We have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days: 18,19,20,21 of November 2016.\n\n 26. We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n 27. How to compute for hour 0 (00:00): \n        day1: 2016-11-18 00:00:00 -> 9.846\n        day2: 2016-11-19 00:00:00 -> 15.740\n        day3: 2016-11-20 00:00:00 -> 8.774\n        day4: 2016-11-21 00:00:00 -> 12.927\n        avg0 = (9.846+15.740+8.774+12.927)/4 = 11.57175\n\n 28. Similarly for hour 1 (01:00):\n        day1: 9.176\n        day2: 17.013\n        day3: 6.028\n        day4: 13.463\n        avg1 = (9.176+17.013+6.028+13.463)/4 = 11.42000\n\n 29. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 30. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n        Day1: 2016-11-22 00:00:00 -> avg0\n               2016-11-22 01:00:00 -> avg1\n               ... until 2016-11-22 23:00:00 -> avg23\n        Day2: 2016-11-23 00:00:00 -> avg0\n               ... and so on.\n\n 31. We must generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-11-22 00:00:00.\n\n 32. The last given date is 2016-11-21 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-11-22 00:00:00.\n\n 33. We generate 96 rows.\n\n 34. We must format the forecasted values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 35. However, note: the input data has values with 3 decimal places. We will round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 36. But note: the problem says \"the data will have missing values\" - we interpret that as the input data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 there are none. \n     Since we are only given missing values in the input, and we don't have any, we proceed. For the forecast, we are generating a complete set.\n\n 37. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and collect the values for that hour from the 4 days.\n\n     Hour 0: [9.846, 15.740, 8.774, 12.927] -> avg = (9.846+15.740+8.774+12.927)/4 = 47.287/4 = 11.82175 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 11.822? \n        But wait: 9.846+15.740=25.586; 25.586+8.774=34.36; 34.36+12.927=47.287 -> 47.287/4 = 11.82175 -> 11.822\n\n     However, let me recalculate: \n        9.846 + 15.740 = 25.586\n        8.774 + 12.927 = 21.701\n        25.586 + 21.701 = 47.287\n        47.287 / 4 = 11.82175 -> which rounds to 11.822\n\n     But wait, the example above for hour0 I had 11.57175? That was a miscalculation.\n\n     Correction:\n        9.846 + 15.740 = 25.586\n        8.774 + 12.927 = 21.701\n        Total = 25.586 + 21.701 = 47.287\n        47.287 / 4 = 11.82175 -> 11.822\n\n     Similarly, hour1:\n        9.176 + 17.013 = 26.189\n        6.028 + 13.463 = 19.491\n        Total = 26.189 + 19.491 = 45.68\n        45.68 / 4 = 11.420\n\n     So we do for all.\n\n 38. We must be cautious: the data has 24 hours per day and 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n 39. We'll compute the averages for each hour and then assign.\n\n 40. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-11-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n 41. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL'\n\n 42. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 43. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 44. Since we cannot run code, we have to compute the 24 averages manually? That's tedious but we can do for the first few and then the pattern.\n\n 45. Alternatively, we can note that the data might have a pattern that we can describe. But we are going to compute the 24 averages.\n\n 46. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (9.846, 15.740, 8.774, 12.927) -> 11.82175 -> 11.822\n        hour1: (9.176, 17.013, 6.028, 13.463) -> 11.420\n        hour2: (7.368, 15.472, 8.172, 13.396) -> (7.368+15.472=22.84; 8.172+13.396=21.568; 22.84+21.568=44.408; 44.408/4=11.102) -> 11.102\n        hour3: (9.578, 15.338, 8.372, 13.597) -> (9.578+15.338=24.916; 8.372+13.597=21.969; 24.916+21.969=46.885; 46.885/4=11.721) -> 11.721\n        hour4: (9.310, 15.070, 9.310, 11.119) -> (9.310+15.070=24.38; 9.310+11.119=20.429; 24.38+20.429=44.809; 44.809/4=11.202) -> 11.202\n        hour5: (9.176, 15.271, 8.038, 10.985) -> (9.176+15.271=24.447; 8.038+10.985=19.023; 24.447+19.023=43.47; 43.47/4=10.868) -> 10.868\n        hour6: (8.105, 14.468, 6.162, 10.516) -> (8.105+14.468=22.573; 6.162+10.516=16.678; 22.573+16.678=39.251; 39.251/4=9.813) -> 9.813\n        hour7: (9.444, 15.137, 7.770, 13.597) -> (9.444+15.137=24.581; 7.770+13.597=21.367; 24.581+21.367=45.948; 45.948/4=11.487) -> 11.487\n        hour8: (9.645, 12.659, 6.229, 10.382) -> (9.645+12.659=22.304; 6.229+10.382=16.611; 22.304+16.611=38.915; 38.915/4=9.729) -> 9.729\n        hour9: (8.038, 9.377, 6.430, 8.975) -> (8.038+9.377=17.415; 6.430+8.975=15.405; 17.415+15.405=32.82; 32.82/4=8.205) -> 8.205\n        hour10: (8.105, 11.186, 6.966, 8.239) -> (8.105+11.186=19.291; 6.966+8.239=15.205; 19.291+15.205=34.496; 34.496/4=8.624) -> 8.624\n        hour11: (9.109, 11.320, 7.569, 8.239) -> (9.109+11.320=20.429; 7.569+8.239=15.808; 20.429+15.808=36.237; 36.237/4=9.059) -> 9.059\n        hour12: (5.827, 8.439, 5.224, 6.229) -> (5.827+8.439=14.266; 5.224+6.229=11.453; 14.266+11.453=25.719; 25.719/4=6.430) -> 6.430\n        hour13: (6.162, 8.640, 5.224, 6.698) -> (6.162+8.640=14.802; 5.224+6.698=11.922; 14.802+11.922=26.724; 26.724/4=6.681) -> 6.681\n        hour14: (7.234, 10.315, 5.023, 6.966) -> (7.234+10.315=17.549; 5.023+6.966=11.989; 17.549+11.989=29.538; 29.538/4=7.385) -> 7.385\n        hour15: (7.368, 9.645, 6.564, 7.569) -> (7.368+9.645=17.013; 6.564+7.569=14.133; 17.013+14.133=31.146; 31.146/4=7.787) -> 7.787\n        hour16: (6.966, 9.377, 6.765, 6.698) -> (6.966+9.377=16.343; 6.765+6.698=13.463; 16.343+13.463=29.806; 29.806/4=7.452) -> 7.452\n        hour17: (8.640, 10.583, 8.239, 8.372) -> (8.640+10.583=19.223; 8.239+8.372=16.611; 19.223+16.611=35.834; 35.834/4=8.959) -> 8.959\n        hour18: (9.310, 8.038, 8.105, 7.636) -> (9.310+8.038=17.348; 8.105+7.636=15.741; 17.348+15.741=33.089; 33.089/4=8.272) -> 8.272\n        hour19: (9.377, 6.765, 7.368, 7.100) -> (9.377+6.765=16.142; 7.368+7.100=14.468; 16.142+14.468=30.61; 30.61/4=7.653) -> 7.653\n        hour20: (8.306, 6.497, 6.296, 6.296) -> (8.306+6.497=14.803; 6.296+6.296=12.592; 14.803+12.592=27.395; 27.395/4=6.849) -> 6.849\n        hour21: (7.368, 5.090, 6.966, 5.961) -> (7.368+5.090=12.458; 6.966+5.961=12.927; 12.458+12.927=25.385; 25.385/4=6.346) -> 6.346\n        hour22: (9.377, 7.837, 8.506, 7.636) -> (9.377+7.837=17.214; 8.506+7.636=16.142; 17.214+16.142=33.356; 33.356/4=8.339) -> 8.339\n        hour23: (12.056, 8.105, 8.439, 9.779) -> (12.056+8.105=20.161; 8.439+9.779=18.218; 20.161+18.218=38.379; 38.379/4=9.595) -> 9.595\n\n 47. Now, we create the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-11-22 to 2016-11-25) by repeating these 24 for 4 times.\n\n 48. The dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-22 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2016-11-23 00:00:00 to 2016-11-23 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2016-11-25 23:00:00\n\n 49. We write the data:\n\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00, 11.822\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00, 11.420\n        2016-11-22 02:00:00, 11.102\n        ... until\n        2016-11-22 23:00:00, 9.595\n\n        Then 2016-11-23 00:00:00, 11.822\n        ... and so on.\n\n 50. We output 96 rows.\n\n 51. We format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate, HUFL\n2016-11-22 00:00:00, 11.822\n2016-11-22 01:00:00, 11.420\n...\n2016-11-25 23:00:00, 9.595\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 52. But note: the input had the date format as \"2016-11-18 00:00:00\", so we use the same.\n\n 53. We must be cautious: the last given date was 2016-11-21 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-11-22 00:00:00.\n\n 54. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime: 2016-11-22 00:00:00, then add 1 hour until 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n 55. We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 56. We output the HUFL values in the order of the computed averages for the 24 hours, repeated 4 times.\n\n 57. We write the complete data.\n\n 58. Since the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content\", we output all 96 rows.\n\n 59. We note that the forecast method is a simple average of the same hour over the last 4 days. This is a naive seasonal method, but given the short history, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 60. We output the data.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not given any in the input, so we did not handle any. \n But if in the input there were missing values, we would have to impute them. Since the provided 96 are complete, we are safe.\n\n Let's write the first 24 hours (first day) of the forecast:\n\n        date                HUFL\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 11.822\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 11.420\n        2016-11-22 02:00:00 11.102\n        2016-11-22 03:00:00 11.721\n        2016-11-22 04:00:00 11.202\n        2016-11-22 05:00:00 10.868\n        2016-11-22 06:00:00 9.813\n        2016-11-22 07:00:00 11.487\n        2016-11-22 08:00:00 9.729\n        2016-11-22 09:00:00 8.205\n        2016-11-22 10:00:00 8.624\n        2016-11-22 11:00:00 9.059\n        2016-11-22 12:00:00 6.430\n        2016-11-22 13:00:00 6.681\n        2016-11-22 14:00:00 7.385\n        2016-11-22 15:00:00 7.787\n        2016-11-22 16:00:00 7.452\n        2016-11-22 17:00:00 8.959\n        2016-11-22 18:00:00 8.272\n        2016-11-22 19:00:00 7.653\n        2016-11-22 20:00:00 6.849\n        2016-11-22 21:00:00 6.346\n        2016-11-22 22:00:00 8.339\n        2016-11-22 23:00:00 9.595\n\n Then the next day (2016-11-23) is the same 24 numbers again.\n\n 61. We write the entire 96 rows.\n\n 62. We note: the values are rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 63. We output the answer in the required format.\n",
