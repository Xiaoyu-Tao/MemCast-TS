        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-19 00:00:00 to 2016-09-22 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data might have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete? We are to be cautious, but the given data for the past 96 dates is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of history, we can consider time series models that capture daily seasonality (24-hour pattern).\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting and can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. We note that the data is for \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL). We observe from the data that there seems to be a daily pattern (e.g., values at night and day).\n\n 5. We can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality. However, with only 4 days, it's challenging to capture weekly patterns, but we can capture daily (24 periods) seasonality.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal component (SARIMA) but with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be hard to fit. We have 4*24=96 points, so we can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n 7. However, note that the data starts at 2016-09-19 and ends at 2016-09-22 (4 days). We are to forecast the next 4 days (2016-09-23 to 2016-09-26).\n\n 8. We must be cautious: the data might have missing values in the future? But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". However, the provided 96 points do not have any missing values? We are only given 96 points without gaps. So we assume the provided history is complete.\n\n 9. For forecasting, we are to generate 96 future points without any missing values? The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\". So we must output 96 points.\n\n 10. We choose a model: Given the small data size, we can use a simple moving average, exponential smoothing, or a small SARIMA model. However, we note that the data has a clear daily pattern.\n\n 11. We can use the following approach:\n     - Use a seasonal decomposition to model the trend and seasonality, then forecast the components.\n     - Or use a naive seasonal method: forecast each hour by the average of that hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a model like Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (which handles seasonality) with a period of 24.\n\n 13. However, with only 4 seasons (days) of data, the Holt-Winters model might not be very stable, but we can try.\n\n 14. Another idea: use an average of the last 4 days for each hour. That is, for hour 00:00, we take the average of the 00:00 of the 4 days we have, and use that for the next 4 days? But we have 4 days to forecast, so we can use the same pattern? \n\n     Example: \n        Day1: h0, h1, ... h23\n        Day2: h0, h1, ... h23\n        Day3: h0, h1, ... h23\n        Day4: h0, h1, ... h23\n\n     Then for the next day (day5) at hour 0: we can use the average of [h0 from day1, h0 from day2, h0 from day3, h0 from day4]\n     Similarly for hour1, etc.\n\n 15. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall trend:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-19: values from 3.014 to 4.287 (with fluctuations)\n        Day2: 2016-09-20: 5.760 to 4.555\n        Day3: 2016-09-21: 4.823 to 2.813\n        Day4: 2016-09-22: 3.349 to 3.215\n\n     There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. So we can assume stationarity in the daily cycle.\n\n 16. Therefore, we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that average for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps for averaging:\n        - Group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and take the mean of each hour.\n\n     However, note that the data for the same hour in different days might vary. We have 4 values for each hour (from 4 days). We can take the mean.\n\n 17. But what if there is a pattern that changes over the week? We don't have weekly data (only 4 days, which are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday). The next 4 days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? Actually:\n\n        2016-09-19: Monday\n        2016-09-20: Tuesday\n        2016-09-21: Wednesday\n        2016-09-22: Thursday\n\n        Then next:\n        2016-09-23: Friday\n        2016-09-24: Saturday\n        2016-09-25: Sunday\n        2016-09-26: Monday\n\n     We don't have data for Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So the same pattern might not hold? But we have 4 days of weekdays? The next Monday (2016-09-26) we have data for Monday (2016-09-19) but the other days (Fri, Sat, Sun) we don't.\n\n 18. Given the lack of data for weekends, we have to use the available data. We can assume that the pattern for Friday, Saturday, Sunday is similar to the weekdays? Or we can use the overall average for each hour? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the entire 4 days to compute the average for each hour and use that for the next 4 days, regardless of the day of week.\n\n 20. Since we don't have any information about weekends, we have to rely on the available data.\n\n 21. We decide to compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 22. How to compute:\n\n        hour0: (3.014 + 5.760 + 4.823 + 3.349) / 4 = ?\n        hour1: (5.224 + 4.890 + 4.354 + 3.416) / 4 = ?\n        ... and so on for each hour.\n\n 23. Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 24. This method is simple and captures the daily pattern.\n\n 25. Let's calculate the averages:\n\n        hour0: (3.014, 5.760, 4.823, 3.349) -> (3.014+5.760+4.823+3.349)/4 = 17.946/4 = 4.4865\n        hour1: (5.224, 4.890, 4.354, 3.416) -> (5.224+4.890+4.354+3.416)/4 = 17.884/4 = 4.471\n        hour2: (4.823, 5.559, 4.354, 3.684) -> (4.823+5.559+4.354+3.684)/4 = 18.42/4 = 4.605\n        hour3: (4.421, 5.358, 4.086, 4.019) -> (4.421+5.358+4.086+4.019)/4 = 17.884/4 = 4.471\n        hour4: (4.421, 5.492, 6.162, 3.081) -> (4.421+5.492+6.162+3.081)/4 = 19.156/4 = 4.789\n        hour5: (3.885, 4.823, 6.497, 4.019) -> (3.885+4.823+6.497+4.019)/4 = 19.224/4 = 4.806\n        hour6: (2.612, 4.957, 6.631, 3.282) -> (2.612+4.957+6.631+3.282)/4 = 17.482/4 = 4.3705\n        hour7: (6.229, 5.827, 5.492, 5.559) -> (6.229+5.827+5.492+5.559)/4 = 23.107/4 = 5.77675\n        hour8: (4.957, 4.153, 3.483, 4.622) -> (4.957+4.153+3.483+4.622)/4 = 17.215/4 = 4.30375\n        hour9: (4.890, 4.153, 1.808, 4.756) -> (4.890+4.153+1.808+4.756)/4 = 15.607/4 = 3.90175\n        hour10: (4.019, 3.818, 1.674, 3.885) -> (4.019+3.818+1.674+3.885)/4 = 13.396/4 = 3.349\n        hour11: (3.684, 3.416, 3.416, 3.416) -> (3.684+3.416+3.416+3.416)/4 = 13.932/4 = 3.483\n        hour12: (3.483, 3.148, 2.947, 3.148) -> (3.483+3.148+2.947+3.148)/4 = 12.726/4 = 3.1815\n        hour13: (3.818, 3.282, 3.148, 3.148) -> (3.818+3.282+3.148+3.148)/4 = 13.396/4 = 3.349\n        hour14: (3.684, 3.014, 3.550, 3.550) -> (3.684+3.014+3.550+3.550)/4 = 13.798/4 = 3.4495\n        hour15: (3.684, 3.282, 3.483, 4.019) -> (3.684+3.282+3.483+4.019)/4 = 14.468/4 = 3.617\n        hour16: (3.416, 3.148, 2.746, 3.148) -> (3.416+3.148+2.746+3.148)/4 = 12.458/4 = 3.1145\n        hour17: (3.081, 2.947, 2.277, 3.081) -> (3.081+2.947+2.277+3.081)/4 = 11.386/4 = 2.8465\n        hour18: (2.947, 2.545, 2.143, 2.478) -> (2.947+2.545+2.143+2.478)/4 = 10.113/4 = 2.52825\n        hour19: (2.679, 2.545, 2.478, 2.344) -> (2.679+2.545+2.478+2.344)/4 = 10.046/4 = 2.5115\n        hour20: (2.880, 2.746, 2.880, 2.612) -> (2.880+2.746+2.880+2.612)/4 = 11.118/4 = 2.7795\n        hour21: (1.875, 2.143, 2.277, 2.746) -> (1.875+2.143+2.277+2.746)/4 = 9.041/4 = 2.26025\n        hour22: (4.421, 4.421, 4.153, 3.148) -> (4.421+4.421+4.153+3.148)/4 = 16.143/4 = 4.03575\n        hour23: (4.287, 4.555, 2.813, 3.215) -> (4.287+4.555+2.813+3.215)/4 = 14.87/4 = 3.7175\n\n 26. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the above 24 averages for 4 times.\n\n 27. The dates: \n        Start: 2016-09-23 00:00:00 (Friday)\n        Then 2016-09-23 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-26 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We generate the dates in hourly frequency.\n\n 29. We output the data in the same format: two columns: \"date\" and \"HULL\", with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 30. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 31. Example for the first day (2016-09-23):\n\n        2016-09-23 00:00:00 4.4865\n        2016-09-23 01:00:00 4.471\n        ... until 2016-09-23 23:00:00: 3.7175\n\n     Then the next day (2016-09-24) we repeat the same 24 numbers.\n\n 32. We note that the averages we computed are the mean of the 4 days. This is a simple and reasonable approach given the data.\n\n 33. However, we must note that the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are only using the provided 96 points to compute the average and then forecasting. We are not given any missing values in the history, so we are safe.\n\n 34. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 35. Let's write the data:\n\n        We'll create a list of the 96 dates and then the 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n 36. The dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 23, 9) -> but wait, the last date in the input is 2016-09-22 23:00:00, so next is 2016-09-23 00:00:00.\n\n        We can generate:\n\n          base = datetime(2016, 9,23) -> but wait, the month is September (9), but the date is 2016-09-23.\n\n        Actually, the input dates are in the format: 2016-09-19, so month=9, day=19.\n\n        So for the next date: 2016-09-23 00:00:00.\n\n        We generate 96 hours from that start.\n\n 37. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        start = datetime(2016, 9, 23, 0, 0, 0)\n        then add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n 38. The HULL values: we have a list of 24 averages (for hour0 to hour23). We repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 39. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-09-23 00:00:00 4.4865\n2016-09-23 01:00:00 4.471\n... (and so on)\n```\n\n 40. We must be cautious: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast. We are not missing any.\n\n 41. We output 96 lines.\n\n 42. We note: the averages we computed are with 4 decimal places? The input data had 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places? But the problem does not specify. However, the input has 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 43. We round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 44. Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n        hour0: 4.4865 -> 4.486 -> but wait, 4.4865 rounded to 3 decimals: 4.487? \n        Actually, 4.4865: \n            The fourth decimal is 5, so we round up: 4.487\n\n        However, let's do it consistently: we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll recalc each average and round.\n\n 45. Alternatively, we can use the exact value and then format to 3 decimal places? But the problem input has 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. We decide to round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. Recompute the averages with rounding:\n\n        hour0: (3.014+5.760+4.823+3.349)/4 = 17.946/4 = 4.4865 -> 4.487\n        hour1: (5.224+4.890+4.354+3.416)/4 = 17.884/4 = 4.471 -> 4.471\n        hour2: (4.823+5.559+4.354+3.684)/4 = 18.42/4 = 4.605 -> 4.605\n        hour3: (4.421+5.358+4.086+4.019)/4 = 17.884/4 = 4.471 -> 4.471\n        hour4: (4.421+5.492+6.162+3.081)/4 = 19.156/4 = 4.789 -> 4.789\n        hour5: (3.885+4.823+6.497+4.019)/4 = 19.224/4 = 4.806 -> 4.806\n        hour6: (2.612+4.957+6.631+3.282)/4 = 17.482/4 = 4.3705 -> 4.371\n        hour7: (6.229+5.827+5.492+5.559)/4 = 23.107/4 = 5.77675 -> 5.777\n        hour8: (4.957+4.153+3.483+4.622)/4 = 17.215/4 = 4.30375 -> 4.304\n        hour9: (4.890+4.153+1.808+4.756)/4 = 15.607/4 = 3.90175 -> 3.902\n        hour10: (4.019+3.818+1.674+3.885)/4 = 13.396/4 = 3.349 -> 3.349\n        hour11: (3.684+3.416+3.416+3.416)/4 = 13.932/4 = 3.483 -> 3.483\n        hour12: (3.483+3.148+2.947+3.148)/4 = 12.726/4 = 3.1815 -> 3.182\n        hour13: (3.818+3.282+3.148+3.148)/4 = 13.396/4 = 3.349 -> 3.349\n        hour14: (3.684+3.014+3.550+3.550)/4 = 13.798/4 = 3.4495 -> 3.450\n        hour15: (3.684+3.282+3.483+4.019)/4 = 14.468/4 = 3.617 -> 3.617\n        hour16: (3.416+3.148+2.746+3.148)/4 = 12.458/4 = 3.1145 -> 3.115\n        hour17: (3.081+2.947+2.277+3.081)/4 = 11.386/4 = 2.8465 -> 2.847\n        hour18: (2.947+2.545+2.143+2.478)/4 = 10.113/4 = 2.52825 -> 2.528\n        hour19: (2.679+2.545+2.478+2.344)/4 = 10.046/4 = 2.5115 -> 2.512\n        hour20: (2.880+2.746+2.880+2.612)/4 = 11.118/4 = 2.7795 -> 2.780\n        hour21: (1.875+2.143+2.277+2.746)/4 = 9.041/4 = 2.26025 -> 2.260\n        hour22: (4.421+4.421+4.153+3.148)/4 = 16.143/4 = 4.03575 -> 4.036\n        hour23: (4.287+4.555+2.813+3.215)/4 = 14.87/4 = 3.7175 -> 3.718\n\n 48. Now, we have the 24 values for the day:\n\n        [4.487, 4.471, 4.605, 4.471, 4.789, 4.806, 4.371, 5.777, 4.304, 3.902, 3.349, 3.483, 3.182, 3.349, 3.450, 3.617, 3.115, 2.847, 2.528, 2.512, 2.780, 2.260, 4.036, 3.718]\n\n 49. We will repeat this list 4 times for the 4 days.\n\n 50. Now, generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-23\n        Day2: 2016-09-24\n        Day3: 2016-09-25\n        Day4: 2016-09-26\n\n        For each day, we have 24 hours.\n\n 51.
