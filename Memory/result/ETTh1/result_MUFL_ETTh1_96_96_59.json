        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might have missing values. However, for forecasting, we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality, we can use a seasonal decomposition or a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n However, note: the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: higher values during the night (e.g., around 00:00 to 08:00) and lower during the day (especially around 10:00 to 16:00) and then a rise in the evening.\n   - There is a negative value on 2017-02-23 12:00:00 (-4.762) and even more negative values on 2017-02-24 and 2017-02-25 during the day.\n\n 4. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Given the complexity and the need for seasonality, we choose a model: SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). The seasonality period is 24 (for hourly data with daily pattern).\n\n 5. We must handle the data as a time series. We'll use the last 96 points to fit a model and then forecast.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days, which is very short for fitting a seasonal model with a period of 24. We might have to use a simpler model or use a model that can capture the pattern with minimal data.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: \n    - Use the average of the same hour from the previous days to forecast the next day. But we have only 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days to get the next day (which would be the 5th day). Then for the 6th day, we can use the same pattern? But that would be too naive and might not capture trends.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the last week's same day? But we don't have a full week of the same day (only one of each: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). We are forecasting Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? (2017-02-26 is Sunday, 2017-02-27 Monday, 2017-02-28 Tuesday, 2017-03-01 Wednesday).\n\n 8. We can try to use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. But note: the pattern might change by day of the week.\n\n 9. Given the limited data, we can use a model that uses the last 4 days to predict the next day, and then use the forecasted day to predict the next, and so on? But that might accumulate error.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simple linear model with time features (hour of day, day of week) but we only have 4 days so day of week will have only one example per day.\n\n 11. Given the constraints, we decide to use a seasonal naive model: \n      y_{t+24} = y_t   (for the same hour of the next day) \n     But we are forecasting 96 steps, so we can use the last day (2017-02-25) to forecast 2017-02-26? But then 2017-02-27 would be the same as 2017-02-22? (which is Wednesday) but 2017-02-26 is Sunday and we don't have a Sunday in the data.\n\n 12. We have:\n      Day0: 2017-02-22 (Wednesday)\n      Day1: 2017-02-23 (Thursday)\n      Day2: 2017-02-24 (Friday)\n      Day3: 2017-02-25 (Saturday)\n\n     We are forecasting:\n      Day4: 2017-02-26 (Sunday)\n      Day5: 2017-02-27 (Monday)\n      Day6: 2017-02-28 (Tuesday)\n      Day7: 2017-03-01 (Wednesday)\n\n     We can use:\n        For Sunday (2017-02-26): use the average of the same hour of the previous Sunday? But we don't have any Sunday.\n\n 13. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days? That would be a moving average without considering the day of week.\n\n     Let F(t) for t in [2017-02-26 00:00:00, 2017-02-26 23:00:00] be the average of the values at the same hour on 2017-02-22, 2017-02-23, 2017-02-24, 2017-02-25.\n\n     Then for 2017-02-27, we use the same average? But that would be the same as 2017-02-26? \n\n     However, note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the values at 00:00:\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00: 8.706\n        2017-02-23 00:00:00: 8.777\n        2017-02-24 00:00:00: 10.056\n        2017-02-25 00:00:00: 8.315\n        Average: (8.706+8.777+10.056+8.315)/4 = 8.9635\n\n     Then for 2017-02-26 00:00:00, we use 8.9635.\n\n     Similarly, for 01:00: \n        8.813, 9.204, 10.270, 7.071 -> average = (8.813+9.204+10.270+7.071)/4 = 8.8395\n\n     But note: the pattern on Saturday (2017-02-25) was different? It had a drop at 00:00? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the last available same day of the week? But we don't have multiple weeks.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days for the entire forecast period. This assumes that the pattern is stable and the average over the last 4 days is the best predictor for the next 4 days.\n\n     However, note: the data shows a downward trend in the daytime values? For example, at 12:00:\n        2017-02-22: 3.482\n        2017-02-23: -4.762\n        2017-02-24: -10.589\n        2017-02-25: -10.980\n        Average: (3.482 -4.762 -10.589 -10.980)/4 = -5.71225\n\n     But is this trend continuing? We don't have enough data to know.\n\n 16. Another approach: use the last day (2017-02-25) as the forecast for 2017-02-26 (Sunday) because Saturday and Sunday might be similar? Then for Monday, we use the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have Monday.\n\n 17. Considering the instructions and the lack of data, we choose a simple method: \n        - For the average of the same hour over the last 4 days, and use that for each of the next 4 days.\n\n     Why 4 days? Because we are forecasting 4 days and we have 4 days of history.\n\n     However, note: the next 4 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We have one Wednesday (2017-02-22) in the history, but the other days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday) are not the same as the forecast days.\n\n 18. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days for each of the next 4 days. This is a constant pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps:\n        For each hour in [0,23]:\n            value = average of the 4 values at that hour in the history (from 2017-02-22 to 2017-02-25)\n        Then, for each day in the forecast period (2017-02-26 to 2017-03-01) 4 days), we assign the average for that hour.\n\n 20. But note: the data has 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). We are going to generate 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) by repeating the same 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n 21. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (8.706 + 8.777 + 10.056 + 8.315) / 4 = 8.9635\n        hour1: (8.813 + 9.204 + 10.270 + 7.071) / 4 = 8.8395\n        hour2: (8.528 + 8.848 + 10.554 + 8.457) / 4 = 9.09675\n        hour3: (8.031 + 9.559 + 8.919 + 8.280) / 4 = 8.69725\n        hour4: (7.676 + 7.249 + 8.813 + 8.990) / 4 = 8.182\n        hour5: (7.711 + 7.071 + 10.270 + 6.965) / 4 = 8.00425\n        hour6: (9.026 + 9.204 + 8.599 + 8.173) / 4 = 8.7505\n        hour7: (10.838 + 8.990 + 11.762 + 9.097) / 4 = 10.17175\n        hour8: (8.351 + 7.995 + 6.645 + 2.701) / 4 = 6.423\n        hour9: (8.315 + 6.894 + 1.421 -1.990) / 4 = 3.66\n        hour10: (6.325 + 4.300 -5.437 -5.615) / 4 = -0.10675\n        hour11: (4.939 + 2.097 -6.645 -7.604) / 4 = -1.80325\n        hour12: (3.482 -4.762 -10.589 -10.980) / 4 = -5.71225\n        hour13: (5.153 + 2.274 -8.244 -8.422) / 4 = -2.30975\n        hour14: (3.802 + 2.452 -6.681 -8.848) / 4 = -2.31875\n        hour15: (5.046 + 1.102 -4.477 -5.295) / 4 = -0.906\n        hour16: (4.868 + 1.137 -2.132 -2.914) / 4 = 0.23975\n        hour17: (6.361 + 3.980 + 2.878 + 3.127) / 4 = 4.0865\n        hour18: (6.041 + 5.295 + 5.010 + 4.477) / 4 = 5.20575\n        hour19: (6.538 + 6.396 + 6.041 + 5.579) / 4 = 6.1385\n        hour20: (6.076 + 5.686 + 5.721 + 5.437) / 4 = 5.730\n        hour21: (8.066 + 7.640 + 6.254 + 5.579) / 4 = 6.88475\n        hour22: (8.173 + 7.711 + 6.610 + 7.391) / 4 = 7.47125\n        hour23: (9.950 + 10.341 + 8.493 + 10.412) / 4 = 9.799\n\n 22. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-26 (Sunday): [8.9635, 8.8395, 9.09675, 8.69725, 8.182, 8.00425, 8.7505, 10.17175, 6.423, 3.66, -0.10675, -1.80325, -5.71225, -2.30975, -2.31875, -0.906, 0.23975, 4.0865, 5.20575, 6.1385, 5.730, 6.88475, 7.47125, 9.799]\n\n        Day2: 2017-02-27 (Monday): same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2017-02-28 (Tuesday): same 24 numbers\n        Day4: 2017-03-01 (Wednesday): same 24 numbers\n\n 23. However, note: the data has a Wednesday (2017-02-22) and we are forecasting a Wednesday (2017-03-01). But we are using the same average for all days. This is a very simple method, but given the data constraints, it might be acceptable.\n\n 24. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n 25. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2017-02-26 00:00:00, 8.9635\n        2017-02-26 01:00:00, 8.8395\n        ... \n        2017-03-01 23:00:00, 9.799\n        </answer>\n\n 26. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are not given any missing values in the input, so we don't need to impute for the history. For the future, we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 27. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 28. Let's recalculate the averages and round to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: (8.706+8.777+10.056+8.315)/4 = 8.9635 -> 8.964\n        hour1: (8.813+9.204+10.270+7.071)/4 = 8.8395 -> 8.840\n        hour2: (8.528+8.848+10.554+8.457)/4 = 9.09675 -> 9.097\n        hour3: (8.031+9.559+8.919+8.280)/4 = 8.69725 -> 8.697\n        hour4: (7.676+7.249+8.813+8.990)/4 = 8.182 -> 8.182\n        hour5: (7.711+7.071+10.270+6.965)/4 = 8.00425 -> 8.004\n        hour6: (9.026+9.204+8.599+8.173)/4 = 8.7505 -> 8.751\n        hour7: (10.838+8.990+11.762+9.097)/4 = 10.17175 -> 10.172\n        hour8: (8.351+7.995+6.645+2.701)/4 = 6.423 -> 6.423\n        hour9: (8.315+6.894+1.421-1.990)/4 = 3.66 -> 3.660\n        But: 8.315+6.894+1.421-1.990 = 14.64 -> 14.64/4=3.660 -> 3.660\n        hour10: (6.325+4.300-5.437-5.615)/4 = (-0.427)/4 = -0.10675 -> -0.107\n        hour11: (4.939+2.097-6.645-7.604)/4 = (-7.213)/4 = -1.80325 -> -1.803\n        hour12: (3.482-4.762-10.589-10.980)/4 = (-22.849)/4 = -5.71225 -> -5.712\n        hour13: (5.153+2.274-8.244-8.422)/4 = (-9.239)/4 = -2.30975 -> -2.310\n        hour14: (3.802+2.452-6.681-8.848)/4 = (-9.275)/4 = -2.31875 -> -2.319\n        hour15: (5.046+1.102-4.477-5.295)/4 = (-3.624)/4 = -0.906 -> -0.906\n        hour16: (4.868+1.137-2.132-2.914)/4 = (0.959)/4 = 0.23975 -> 0.240\n        hour17: (6.361+3.980+2.878+3.127)/4 = 16.346/4 = 4.0865 -> 4.087\n        hour18: (6.041+5.295+5.010+4.477)/4 = 20.823/4 = 5.20575 -> 5.206\n        hour19: (6.538+6.396+6.041+5.579)/4 = 24.554/4 = 6.1385 -> 6.139\n        hour20: (6.076+5.686+5.721+5.437)/4 = 22.92/4 = 5.73 -> 5.730\n        But: 22.92/4 = 5.73 -> 5.730\n        hour21: (8.066+7.640+6.254+5.579)/4 = 27.539/4 = 6.88475 -> 6.885\n        hour22: (8.173+7.711+6.610+7.391)/4 = 29.885/4 = 7.47125 -> 7.471\n        hour23: (9.950+10.341+8.493+10.412)/4 = 39.196/4 = 9.799 -> 9.799\n\n 29. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-26 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-03-01 23:00:00\n\n        We have 4 days, each day has 24 hours.\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-26 (Sunday) -> use the 24 averages above (rounded) for hours 0 to 23.\n        Day2: 2017-02-27 (Monday) -> same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2017-02-28 (Tuesday) -> same 24 numbers\n        Day4: 2017-03-01 (Wednesday) -> same 24 numbers\n\n 30. We output the data in the same format as the input, with the date and the MUFL value.\n\n 31. Note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 32. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-26 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-26 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-27 00:00:00 ... and so on until 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n\n 33. We write the data in a comma separated format.\n\n 34. However, note: the input had the column name as \"date\" and \"MUFL\", but the output should be the same.\n\n 35. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,MUFL\n        2017-02-26 00:00:00,8.964\n        2017-02-26 01:00:00,8.840\n        2017-02-26 02:00:00,9.097\n        2017-02-26 03:00:00,8.697\n        2017-02-26 04:00:00,8.182\n        2017-02-26 05:00:00,8.004\n        2017-02-26 06:00:00,8.751\n        2017-02-26 07:00:00,10.172\n        2017-02-26 08:00:00,6.423\n        2017-02-26 09:00:00,3.660\n        2017-02-26 10:00:00,-0.107\n        2017-02-26 11:00:00,-1.803\n        2017-02-26 12:00:00,-5.712\n        2017-02-26 13:00:00,-2.310\n        2017-02-26 14:00:00,-2.319\n        2017-02-26 15:00:00,-0.906\n        2017-02-26 16:00:00,0.240\n        2017-02-26 17:00:00,4.087\n        2017-02-26 18:00:00,5.206\n        2017-02-26 19:00:00,6.139\n        2017-02-26 20:00:00,5.730\n        2017-02-26 21:00:00,6.885\n        2017-02-26 22:00:00,7.471\n        2017-02-26 23:00:00,9.799\n        2017-02-27 00:00:00,8.964\n        2017-02-27 01:00:00,8.840\n        ... (repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days)\n        2017-03-01 23:00:00,9.799\n\n 36. We must be cautious: the last day of the input is 2017-02-25 23:00:00, so the next day starts at 2017-02-26 00:00:00.\n\n 37. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 38. Since the problem says \"complete data\", we output all 96 lines without omission.\n\n 39. We note that this is a very basic forecast and in practice, more sophisticated models would be used. But given the data limitation (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 40. Let's code the output.\n\n 41. We create a list of the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimals) as above.\n\n 42. Then we generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta? \n        We can do without: \n          Start: 2017-02-26 00:00:00\n          Then add 1 hour until we have 96 points.\n\n 43. We write the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-26, hours 0 to 23\n        Day 2: 2017-02-27, hours 0 to 23\n        Day 3: 2017-02-28, hours 0 to 23\n        Day 4: 2017-03-01, hours 0 to 23\n\n 44. We output the string.\n\n 45. We note: the input had the date as a string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 46. We generate:\n\n        dates = []\n        start_date = \"2017-02-26\"\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = (start_date + timedelta(days=day)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                But we don't have a datetime library, so we do manually.\n\n        Alternatively, we know:\n          2017-02-26, 2017-02-27, 2017-02-28, 2017-03-01.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          days = ['2017-02-26', '2017-02-27', '2017-02-28', '2017-03-01']\n          for day in days:\n             for hour in range(24):\n                 time_str = f\"{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n 47. But note: February 2017: \n        - 2017 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So 2017-02-28 is the last day of February, then 2017-03-01 is the next.\n\n 48. We generate the dates:\n\n        days = [\n            \"2017-02-26\",\n            \"2017-02-27\",\n            \"2017-02-28\",\n            \"2017-03-01\"\n        ]\n\n 49. Then for each day, we assign the 24 values (the same 24 numbers for each day).\n\n 50. We write the output.\n\n 51. The list of the 24 values (rounded to 3 decimals) is:\n\n        [8.964, 8.840, 9.097, 8.697, 8.182, 8.004, 8.751, 10.172, 6.423, 3.660, -0.107, -1.803, -5.712, -2.310, -2.319, -0.906, 0.240, 4.087, 5.206, 6.139, 5.730, 6.885, 7.471, 9.799]\n\n 52. Then for each day in the 4 days, we output the 24 values.\n\n 53. We write the output in the answer block.\n\n 54. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 55. We output 96 lines.\n\n 56. Let's write the answer.\n",
