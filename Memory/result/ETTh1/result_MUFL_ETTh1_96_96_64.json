        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with 24-hour cycles.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any (it's complete). However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with a time series with seasonality and we need a forecast for 96 steps (which is exactly 4 days of hourly data),\n we can use a seasonal model. Given the data length is short (only 4 days of history) and we are to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal Naive method - using the last complete season (24 hours) as the forecast for the next 4 days (but note: we have 4 days of history, so we can average over the 4 days?).\n\n However, the data does not look exactly the same every day. We can see some variation.\n\n Option 2: Use a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) but we have only 4 seasons (days) which is minimal for fitting.\n\n Option 3: Given the constraints, we are to provide a forecast and the data is to be complete, we can use a moving average or a simple average of the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n Let's look at the data:\n\n We have 4 days: \n   Day1: 2017-03-14\n   Day2: 2017-03-15\n   Day3: 2017-03-16\n   Day4: 2017-03-17\n\n We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over these 4 days and then use that average for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n The last day (2017-03-17) seems to have slightly higher values in the night and similar pattern in the day? But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\n Since we are limited by the data, we will use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For hour 0: average of [2017-03-14 00:00:00, 2017-03-15 00:00:00, 2017-03-16 00:00:00, 2017-03-17 00:00:00] = (9.914 + 10.945 + 9.346 + 8.315)/4\n   ... and so on for each hour (0 to 23) and then repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the next 96 hours would be from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a weekly trend or a long-term trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-17) as the forecast for the next day? But the problem asks for 96 hours (4 days). \n\n Considering the above, we choose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days. This will capture the daily seasonality and smooth out some noise.\n\n But note: the data has negative values and fluctuations. We are to provide 96 points.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour of the day for each record (0 to 23).\n   Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n   Step 3: For the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-03-18 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-21 23:00:00), \n            we assign the mean value for that hour (and then repeat the same 24-hour pattern for 4 days).\n\n However, we note that the pattern might not be exactly the same? But with only 4 days, we don't have a better way.\n\n Let's check the hour 0: \n   14th: 9.914\n   15th: 10.945\n   16th: 9.346\n   17th: 8.315\n   Average = (9.914+10.945+9.346+8.315)/4 = 9.630\n\n Similarly, we compute for all 24.\n\n Then the forecast for:\n   2017-03-18 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.630\n   2017-03-18 01:00:00 -> hour1: average of the four days at hour1\n   ... until 2017-03-18 23:00:00 (hour23)\n   then 2017-03-19 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.630 again.\n\n We do this for 4 days.\n\n But note: the data provided ends at 2017-03-17 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-03-18 (24 hours)\n   Day 2: 2017-03-19\n   Day 3: 2017-03-20\n   Day 4: 2017-03-21\n\n We will generate 96 records.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. \n So we can proceed.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour0: (9.914 + 10.945 + 9.346 + 8.315) / 4 = 9.630\n   hour1: (10.980 + 10.696 + 9.204 + 7.924) / 4 = 9.701\n   hour2: (10.163 + 11.584 + 9.310 + 7.178) / 4 = 9.55875\n   hour3: (8.848 + 11.336 + 7.747 + 7.818) / 4 = 8.93725\n   hour4: (9.594 + 11.371 + 9.523 + 7.320) / 4 = 9.452\n   hour5: (8.031 + 11.620 + 7.285 + 7.995) / 4 = 8.73275\n   hour6: (7.036 + 8.066 + 8.919 + 7.676) / 4 = 7.92425\n   hour7: (7.249 + 9.594 + 8.102 + 8.777) / 4 = 8.4305\n   hour8: (1.919 + 5.010 + 5.721 + 6.041) / 4 = 4.67275\n   hour9: (-5.295 + 1.812 + 1.635 + 0.142) / 4 = -0.4265\n   hour10: (-9.168 -7.391 -4.122 -1.528) / 4 = -5.55225\n   hour11: (-10.874 -10.625 + 0.640 -1.706) / 4 = -5.64125\n   hour12: (-13.965 -6.645 -13.539 -4.584) / 4 = -9.68325\n   hour13: (-12.686 -4.975 -8.422 -3.589) / 4 = -7.418\n   hour14: (-10.732 -6.148 -9.914 + 0.284) / 4 = -6.6275\n   hour15: (-8.635 + 1.599 -6.681 + 1.421) / 4 = -3.224\n   hour16: (-5.472 + 3.767 -2.701 + 1.421) / 4 = -0.74625\n   hour17: (0.817 + 5.401 + 2.630 + 4.797) / 4 = 3.41125\n   hour18: (4.584 + 4.620 + 4.193 + 4.655) / 4 = 4.513\n   hour19: (4.975 + 5.010 + 4.939 + 5.082) / 4 = 5.0015\n   hour20: (5.401 + 4.584 + 4.584 + 4.726) / 4 = 4.82375\n   hour21: (6.325 + 6.645 + 4.015 + 6.254) / 4 = 5.80975\n   hour22: (7.285 + 5.899 + 4.513 + 7.214) / 4 = 6.22775\n   hour23: (7.782 + 7.356 + 7.107 + 9.417) / 4 = 7.9155\n\n Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2017-03-18 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-03-17 23:00:00)\n   Then we go up to 2017-03-21 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-03-18): \n        00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.630\n        01:00:00 -> hour1: 9.701\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> hour23: 7.9155\n\n   Day 2 (2017-03-19): same pattern: \n        00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.630\n        ... \n\n   Day 3 (2017-03-20): same pattern\n\n   Day 4 (2017-03-21): same pattern\n\n We output 96 rows.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. \n Let's write the forecast in the required format.\n\n Important: The date must be in the same format and the MUFL values with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input had 3 decimal places, but we computed averages that might have more. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the problem does not specify rounding, but to match the input we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the input had negative values and we must output exactly.\n\n Let's compute and format:\n\n   hour0: 9.630 -> 9.630\n   hour1: 9.701 -> 9.701\n   hour2: 9.55875 -> 9.559 (rounded to 3 decimals: 9.559)\n   ... \n\n We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
