        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be prepared to handle missing values in the forecasting process.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement for 96 forecasts, we might use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet. However, without more context and given the short history, \n    we have to make some assumptions.\n\n 4. We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). There are 4 days of data (96 hours). We can try to capture the seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can use a simple seasonal model. Since we are only given 4 days, we might use a seasonal naive method or a model that captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data does not look perfectly stationary and has some trends within each day. We might consider using a model that can capture both trend and seasonality.\n\n 7. Given the small data size, we can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components. But 4 days is very short for a seasonal decomposition with daily seasonality (only 4 seasons).\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model (SARIMA) with a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 9. But note: the data has negative values and fluctuations. We must choose a model that can handle that.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast for 96 points, we will use a simple approach: \n     - We will use the last available day (2016-12-19) as a base and adjust with the average daily pattern from the 4 days? \n     - However, we note that the pattern might change.\n\n 11. Another idea: use an average of the daily profiles from the 4 days and then project forward. But we have only 4 days, and the last day (2016-12-19) might be the most relevant.\n\n 12. We can also use a moving average method with seasonality.\n\n 13. However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n 14. We decide to use a simple method: \n     - Calculate the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) for each hour (0 to 23). Then, we use that average pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours). \n     - But note: the data might have a trend? We can also adjust for the overall level.\n\n 15. Steps for the method:\n     a) Extract the data for each hour (0 to 23) for the 4 days.\n     b) For each hour, compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n     c) Then, for the next 4 days (from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 16. However, this method ignores any trend. We can also consider the possibility of a drift. But with only 4 days, it's hard to estimate a trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-19) and then adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n 18. We note that the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. The values are fluctuating.\n\n 19. We decide to use the average daily pattern without trend adjustment.\n\n 20. How to handle the starting point? The next day starts at 2016-12-20 00:00:00.\n\n 21. We will generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the average daily pattern for 4 times.\n\n 22. Steps to compute the average daily pattern:\n\n     - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n 23. But note: the data we have is from 2016-12-16 to 2016-12-19 (4 days). We can compute:\n\n        hour0: average of [2016-12-16 00:00:00, 2016-12-17 00:00:00, 2016-12-18 00:00:00, 2016-12-19 00:00:00]\n        hour1: average of [2016-12-16 01:00:00, ...] and so on.\n\n 24. Then, for the next 4 days (2016-12-20 to 2016-12-23), we assign:\n\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00: average for hour0\n        2016-12-20 01:00:00: average for hour1\n        ...\n        2016-12-20 23:00:00: average for hour23\n        2016-12-21 00:00:00: average for hour0\n        ... and so on.\n\n 25. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 26. However, we must note that the data might have anomalies? But without more context, we use the average.\n\n 27. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (0.817 + 0.675 + 0.320 + 1.954) / 4 = (0.817+0.675=1.492; 1.492+0.320=1.812; 1.812+1.954=3.766) -> 3.766/4 = 0.9415\n        Hour 1: (0.711 + 1.066 + 0.853 + 1.350) / 4 = (0.711+1.066=1.777; 1.777+0.853=2.63; 2.63+1.350=3.98) -> 3.98/4 = 0.995\n        ... and so on.\n\n 28. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 29. But note: the data has negative values and the average might be negative.\n\n 30. We'll compute the average for each hour and then repeat that pattern 4 times.\n\n 31. However, the user might expect a more sophisticated forecast? But given the constraints (only 4 days of history) and the requirement for 96 points, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 32. We'll generate the next 96 points by repeating the average daily pattern 4 times.\n\n 33. The dates: \n        Start: 2016-12-20 00:00:00 (the last given date is 2016-12-19 23:00:00, so next is 2016-12-20 00:00:00)\n        Then 2016-12-20 01:00:00 ... until 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n\n 34. We must be cautious: the data has a pattern that might not be exactly the same every day? But we have no other information.\n\n 35. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [0.817, 0.675, 0.320, 1.954] -> mean = (0.817+0.675+0.320+1.954)/4 = 3.766/4 = 0.9415\n        hour1: [0.711, 1.066, 0.853, 1.350] -> (0.711+1.066+0.853+1.350)=3.98 -> 0.995\n        hour2: [0.036, 1.990, 0.817, 0.497] -> (0.036+1.990+0.817+0.497)=3.34 -> 0.835\n        hour3: [0.178, 0.959, 0.284, 0.888] -> (0.178+0.959+0.284+0.888)=2.309 -> 0.57725\n        hour4: [-0.711, 0.888, -0.817, 0.604] -> (-0.711+0.888-0.817+0.604)=(-0.036) -> -0.009\n        hour5: [-1.457, 0.497, 0.178, 0.355] -> (-1.457+0.497+0.178+0.355)=(-0.427) -> -0.10675\n        hour6: [-1.528, 0.142, -0.995, 0.000] -> (-1.528+0.142-0.995+0)=(-2.381) -> -0.59525\n        hour7: [-0.497, 0.142, -1.457, -0.071] -> (-0.497+0.142-1.457-0.071)=(-1.883) -> -0.47075\n        hour8: [0.000, 0.071, -0.213, 0.249] -> (0.000+0.071-0.213+0.249)=0.107 -> 0.02675\n        hour9: [-0.853, -1.066, 0.000, -0.959] -> (-0.853-1.066+0-0.959)=(-2.878) -> -0.7195\n        hour10: [-0.391, -0.569, -0.995, -0.640] -> (-0.391-0.569-0.995-0.640)=(-2.595) -> -0.64875\n        hour11: [-0.391, -1.315, -0.853, -1.457] -> (-0.391-1.315-0.853-1.457)=(-4.016) -> -1.004\n        hour12: [-1.741, -2.132, -2.523, -1.990] -> (-1.741-2.132-2.523-1.990)=(-8.386) -> -2.0965\n        hour13: [-0.853, -0.782, -1.670, -0.995] -> (-0.853-0.782-1.670-0.995)=(-4.3) -> -1.075\n        hour14: [-0.320, -0.497, -1.066, -0.817] -> (-0.320-0.497-1.066-0.817)=(-2.7) -> -0.675\n        hour15: [-0.355, -1.173, -1.066, -1.244] -> (-0.355-1.173-1.066-1.244)=(-3.838) -> -0.9595\n        hour16: [-1.315, -1.492, -1.173, -1.492] -> (-1.315-1.492-1.173-1.492)=(-5.472) -> -1.368\n        hour17: [-1.741, -1.990, -1.777, -1.599] -> (-1.741-1.990-1.777-1.599)=(-7.107) -> -1.77675\n        hour18: [-1.706, -1.848, -1.919, -1.848] -> (-1.706-1.848-1.919-1.848)=(-7.321) -> -1.83025\n        hour19: [-1.706, -1.848, -1.670, -1.848] -> (-1.706-1.848-1.670-1.848)=(-7.072) -> -1.768\n        hour20: [-1.706, -1.812, -1.919, -1.706] -> (-1.706-1.812-1.919-1.706)=(-7.143) -> -1.78575\n        hour21: [-1.777, -3.198, -2.025, -2.452] -> (-1.777-3.198-2.025-2.452)=(-9.452) -> -2.363\n        hour22: [-0.426, -0.959, 0.036, -1.137] -> (-0.426-0.959+0.036-1.137)=(-2.486) -> -0.6215\n        hour23: [0.391, -0.178, -0.995, -1.031] -> (0.391-0.178-0.995-1.031)=(-1.813) -> -0.45325\n\n 36. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-12-20):\n            00:00:00 -> 0.9415\n            01:00:00 -> 0.995\n            02:00:00 -> 0.835\n            03:00:00 -> 0.57725\n            04:00:00 -> -0.009\n            05:00:00 -> -0.10675\n            06:00:00 -> -0.59525\n            07:00:00 -> -0.47075\n            08:00:00 -> 0.02675\n            09:00:00 -> -0.7195\n            10:00:00 -> -0.64875\n            11:00:00 -> -1.004\n            12:00:00 -> -2.0965\n            13:00:00 -> -1.075\n            14:00:00 -> -0.675\n            15:00:00 -> -0.9595\n            16:00:00 -> -1.368\n            17:00:00 -> -1.77675\n            18:00:00 -> -1.83025\n            19:00:00 -> -1.768\n            20:00:00 -> -1.78575\n            21:00:00 -> -2.363\n            22:00:00 -> -0.6215\n            23:00:00 -> -0.45325\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days (2016-12-21, 2016-12-22, 2016-12-23).\n\n 37. We must format the dates correctly. The next date after 2016-12-19 23:00:00 is 2016-12-20 00:00:00.\n\n 38. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 39. We note that the original data had 4 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 40. However, the input data has up to 3 decimal places. So we round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n        hour0: round(0.9415, 3) -> 0.942\n        hour1: 0.995 -> 0.995\n        hour2: 0.835 -> 0.835\n        hour3: 0.57725 -> 0.577\n        hour4: -0.009 -> -0.009\n        hour5: -0.10675 -> -0.107\n        hour6: -0.59525 -> -0.595\n        hour7: -0.47075 -> -0.471\n        hour8: 0.02675 -> 0.027\n        hour9: -0.7195 -> -0.720\n        hour10: -0.64875 -> -0.649\n        hour11: -1.004 -> -1.004\n        hour12: -2.0965 -> -2.097\n        hour13: -1.075 -> -1.075\n        hour14: -0.675 -> -0.675\n        hour15: -0.9595 -> -0.960\n        hour16: -1.368 -> -1.368\n        hour17: -1.77675 -> -1.777\n        hour18: -1.83025 -> -1.830\n        hour19: -1.768 -> -1.768\n        hour20: -1.78575 -> -1.786\n        hour21: -2.363 -> -2.363\n        hour22: -0.6215 -> -0.622\n        hour23: -0.45325 -> -0.453\n\n 42. Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-20 00:00:00, then 2016-12-20 01:00:00, ... until 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n\n 43. We'll generate the dates by incrementing 1 hour at a time.\n\n 44. We must output the exact format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the MULL value with 3 decimal places.\n\n 45. We note that the data we are given ends at 2016-12-19 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-20 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        Day2: 2016-12-21 00:00:00 to 2016-12-21 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2016-12-22 00:00:00 to 2016-12-22 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2016-12-23 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00\n\n 46. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 47. We'll use the pattern for hour0 to hour23 for each day.\n\n 48. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 49. Note: The user said the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast. We are not given any in the history for the provided 96, so we assume no missing in the history for the purpose of this average.\n\n 50. We output the data in the answer block.\n\n 51. We must not omit any content, so we output all 96 lines.\n\n 52. We write the answer in the following format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00  0.942\n        2016-12-20 01:00:00  0.995\n        ... \n        2016-12-23 23:00:00  -0.453\n        </answer>\n\n 53. We note that the original data had the index as a datetime string and then the value. We output without the index, just the string and the value.\n\n 54. We use the rounded values.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n        Day1: 2016-12-20\n            hour0: 0.942\n            hour1: 0.995\n            hour2: 0.835\n            hour3: 0.577\n            hour4: -0.009\n            hour5: -0.107\n            hour6: -0.595\n            hour7: -0.471\n            hour8: 0.027\n            hour9: -0.720\n            hour10: -0.649\n            hour11: -1.004\n            hour12: -2.097\n            hour13: -1.075\n            hour14: -0.675\n            hour15: -0.960\n            hour16: -1.368\n            hour17: -1.777\n            hour18: -1.830\n            hour19: -1.768\n            hour20: -1.786\n            hour21: -2.363\n            hour22: -0.622\n            hour23: -0.453\n\n        Day2: 2016-12-21: same pattern\n        Day3: 2016-12-22: same pattern\n        Day4: 2016-12-23: same pattern\n\n 55. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 56. We note that the dates must be in order and consecutive.\n\n 57. We generate the dates programmatically in code? But we are writing by hand? We can write a loop in our mind.\n\n 58. We output 4 repetitions of the 24-hour pattern.\n\n 59. We write the answer block.\n",
