        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n The data has 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be cautious. We are only given 96 points without gaps? Let's check the dates: \n    The data starts at 2017-02-10 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-02-13 23:00:00. There are 96 records, which is 4 days * 24 hours = 96. So no missing in the provided history.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must generate 96 timestamps: from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n\n 3. Since we are an expert in time series forecasting, we can use a suitable model. Given the hourly data and the apparent seasonality (daily pattern) and possible trend, \n    we can use a model that captures multiple seasonality. However, note that we are only given 4 days of data, which is very limited.\n\n 4. Given the limited data, we might use a simple model. But note: the problem says the data has missing values in general, but the provided history is complete.\n\n 5. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must not omit any.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    We can use a model that captures:\n      - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n      - Also, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so less than a week. So we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n    Given the constraints, we can use:\n      - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality? But we have only 4 seasons (days) of data.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But 4 days might be too few.\n\n    Another idea: use an ARIMA model with seasonal component (SARIMA). However, with only 96 points, we can try to fit a model.\n\n    But note: we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) which is as long as the history. This is challenging.\n\n 7. Considering the above, we might use a naive method: use the last day (2017-02-13) as the forecast for the next day? But that would only give 24 points.\n\n    Alternatively, we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days? But that would be a flat daily pattern.\n\n    However, looking at the data, there is a trend? Let's see:\n\n      2017-02-10: min=4.502, max=9.075\n      2017-02-11: min=6.120, max=11.607\n      2017-02-12: min=7.597, max=14.632\n      2017-02-13: min=8.723, max=15.125\n\n    There seems to be an increasing trend. So we cannot ignore the trend.\n\n 8. We can try to model with a linear trend and daily seasonality. But with only 4 days, we can do:\n\n      y(t) = trend(t) + seasonality(t) + noise\n\n    We can decompose the series into trend and seasonal components. Then project the trend forward and use the same seasonal indices.\n\n    Steps for decomposition:\n      - First, we can compute a moving average to capture the trend. Since we have daily seasonality, we can use a window of 24 hours) to remove the seasonality and get the trend.\n\n    However, with only 4 days, the moving average at the ends will be problematic.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are an AI, we can use a simple method:\n\n      - Compute the daily average for each day to see the trend:\n\n          Day1 (2017-02-10): average = (6.402+6.824+...+7.316)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n          ... but we don't need exact, we can see the daily averages are increasing.\n\n      - We can fit a linear regression to the daily averages to get the trend for the next 4 days.\n\n      - Then, for each hour, we can compute the seasonal index (as the deviation from the daily average) for that hour over the 4 days and average them.\n\n      - Then, for a future day d (from day 5 to day 8) and hour h, we do:\n\n            forecast(d, h) = trend(d) + seasonal_index(h)\n\n        where trend(d) is the linear trend value for day d (with day1=2017-02-10 as day1, day2=2017-02-11, etc. so day5 would be 2017-02-14).\n\n 10. Steps in detail:\n\n      Step 1: Group by day and compute the daily average.\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-10 -> average1\n        Day 2: 2017-02-11 -> average2\n        Day 3: 2017-02-12 -> average3\n        Day 4: 2017-02-13 -> average4\n\n      Step 2: Fit a linear regression to the daily averages. Let day index: [1,2,3,4] and averages: [avg1, avg2, avg4]\n\n        We'll get: trend(t) = intercept + slope * t\n\n        For the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) we compute:\n\n          avg5 = intercept + slope * 5\n          avg6 = intercept + slope * 6\n          avg7 = intercept + slope * 7\n          avg8 = intercept + slope * 8\n\n      Step 3: For each hour of the day (0 to 23), compute the seasonal index:\n\n          For hour h, we have 4 values: \n            s1 = OT(day1, h) - avg1\n            s2 = OT(day2, h) - avg2\n            s3 = OT(day3, h) - avg3\n            s4 = OT(day4, h) - avg4\n\n          Then, seasonal_index(h) = (s1+s2+s3+s4)/4\n\n      Step 4: For a future day d (from 5 to 8) and hour h:\n\n          forecast = (intercept + slope * d) + seasonal_index(h)\n\n 11. However, note: the trend is fitted on daily averages, and we are adding the seasonal index which is the average deviation for that hour.\n\n 12. But what if the trend is not linear? We have only 4 points, so linear is the simplest.\n\n 13.

But we are adding them to the daily average, so we don't need to zero? \n        Actually, the average of the seasonal indices over a day should be zero. But because we are taking the average of the deviations, the average of the 24 indices might not be exactly zero. \n        We can adjust by subtracting the mean of the 24 indices from each index? But to keep it simple, we'll use as is.\n\n      But let's check: the average of the 24 indices should be close to zero? We can compute the average of the 96 deviations? It should be zero? \n        Actually, the deviations per day are computed as the value minus the daily average, so the average of the 24 deviations in a day is zero. \n        Therefore, the average of the 4*24=96 deviations is zero. But when we average the same hour over 4 days, the average of the 24 indices might not be zero? \n        Actually, the average of the 24 indices (each index is the average of 4 deviations) would be the average of the 96 deviations divided by 4, which is zero. \n        we don't need to adjust.\n\n      So we compute for each hour.\n\n      Step 4: For the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) and for each hour h (0..23):\n\n          forecast = daily_avg(day) + seasonal_index(h)\n\n      The dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n          day5: 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-14 23:00:00\n          day6: 2017-02-15 00:00:00 to 2017-02-15 23:00:00\n          day7: 2017-02-16 00:00:00 to 2017-02-16 23:00:00\n          day8: 2017-02-17 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00\n\n 14. We must generate 96 lines of data.\n\n 15. However, note: the user said the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting for the next 96 without missing? We are to provide complete data.\n\n 16. We'll compute the seasonal indices for each hour and then the forecast.\n\n 17. Let's compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour index (0 to 23) and compute the average deviation.\n\n      We have the data by day and hour:\n\n        Day1: [6.402,6.824,6.542,7.457,6.753,6.402,5.417,4.502,5.206,6.050,6.402,7.457,6.824,7.105,9.075,7.738,7.738,7.809,8.442,7.949,7.105,8.160,7.809,7.316]\n        Day2: [6.542,7.386,6.120,4.924,6.542,7.527,7.597,6.753,8.371,6.964,7.316,8.160,8.512,8.512,11.607,9.778,9.708,9.708,9.638,9.215,8.864,9.075,8.371,9.286]\n        Day3: [8.371,9.075,8.864,8.371,8.160,8.231,8.723,8.160,7.597,8.371,9.708,10.833,10.833,12.100,14.632,12.944,13.366,13.577,11.748,10.904,9.215,9.286,9.778,9.497]\n        Day4: [10.060,9.426,9.426,9.426,8.723,8.864,9.145,9.567,9.778,9.426,11.467,12.944,11.678,12.029,15.054,14.491,15.125,13.788,13.436,12.240,12.381,11.396,10.974,10.411]\n\n      Daily averages: [7.0202, 8.1865, 10.0977, 11.3023]\n\n      Now, for hour0 (index0):\n        dev1 = 6.402 - 7.0202 = -0.6182\n        dev2 = 6.542 - 8.1865 = -1.6445\n        dev3 = 8.371 - 10.0977 = -1.7267\n        dev4 = 10.060 - 11.3023 = -1.2423\n        seasonal_index0 = (-0.6182 -1.6445 -1.7267 -1.2423)/4 = -5.2317/4 = -1.307925\n\n      hour1:\n        dev1 = 6.824 - 7.0202 = -0.1962\n        dev2 = 7.386 - 8.1865 = -0.8005\n        dev3 = 9.075 - 10.0977 = -1.0227\n        dev4 = 9.426 - 11.3023 = -1.8763\n        seasonal_index1 = (-0.1962 -0.8005 -1.0227 -1.8763)/4 = -3.8957/4 = -0.973925\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n      We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 18. Then, for the next day (day5, which is 2017-02-14) and hour0: \n        forecast = 12.84105 + (-1.307925) = 11.533125\n\n      hour1: 12.84105 + (-0.973925) = 11.867125\n\n      ... until hour23.\n\n      Then day6: \n        hour0: 14.3168 + (-1.307925) = 13.008875\n        hour1: 14.3168 + (-0.973925) = 13.342875\n\n      and so on.\n\n 19. We'll generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-02-14 00:00:00\n      Then add 1 hour until 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 21. Since the calculation of 24 seasonal indices is tedious, we can write a small program. But we are an AI, so we can do it.\n\n 22. Let's compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours:\n\n      We'll create a list for the seasonal indices: si[0..23]\n\n      We'll compute:\n\n        si[0] = ( (6.402-7.0202) + (6.542-8.1865) + (8.371-10.0977) + (10.060-11.3023) ) / 4\n        = (-0.6182 -1.6445 -1.7267 -1.2423)/4 = -5.2317/4 = -1.307925\n\n        si[1] = ( (6.824-7.0202) + (7.386-8.1865) + (9.075-10.0977) + (9.426-11.3023) ) / 4\n        = (-0.1962 -0.8005 -1.0227 -1.8763)/4 = -3.8957/4 = -0.973925\n\n        si[2] = ( (6.542-7.0202) + (6.120-8.1865) + (8.864-10.0977) + (9.426-11.3023) ) / 4\n        = (-0.4782 -2.0665 -1.2337 -1.8763)/4 = -5.6547/4 = -1.413675\n\n        si[3] = ( (7.457-7.0202) + (4.924-8.1865) + (8.371-10.0977) + (9.426-11.3023) ) / 4\n        = (0.4368 -3.2625 -1.7267 -1.8763)/4 = (-6.4287)/4 = -1.607175\n\n        si[4] = ( (6.753-7.0202) + (6.542-8.1865) + (8.160-10.0977) + (8.723-11.3023) ) / 4\n        = (-0.2672 -1.6445 -1.9377 -2.5793)/4 = -6.4287/4 = -1.607175\n\n        Wait, note: for hour4, we have the same sum as hour3? That's because the numbers are different but the sum of deviations is the same? \n        Actually, let me recalc hour4:\n\n          day1: 6.753 - 7.0202 = -0.2672\n          day2: 6.542 - 8.1865 = -1.6445\n          day3: 8.160 - 10.0977 = -1.9377\n          day4: 8.723 - 11.3023 = -2.5793\n          total = -0.2672 -1.6445 -1.9377 -2.5793 = -6.4287 -> same as hour3? \n          But hour3: \n            day1: 7.457-7.0202 = 0.4368\n            day2: 4.924-8.1865 = -3.2625\n            day3: 8.371-10.0977 = -1.7267\n            day4: 9.426-11.3023 = -1.8763\n          total = 0.4368 -3.2625 -1.7267 -1.8763 = (0.4368) + (-3.2625-1.7267-1.8763) = 0.4368 - 6.8655 = -6.4287\n\n        So indeed, the same total? That's a coincidence.\n\n        si[4] = -6.4287/4 = -1.607175\n\n        We continue for all 24.\n\n      We can write a loop in our mind? But we'll do it step by step.\n\n 23. Due to the length, we are to provide the complete data, we can compute the seasonal indices and then the forecasts.\n\n 24. We'll compute the seasonal indices for each hour:\n\n      hour0: -1.307925\n      hour1: -0.973925\n      hour2: -1.413675\n      hour3: -1.607175\n      hour4: -1.607175\n      hour5: \n        day1: 6.402 -

We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n 28. Due to the length, we'll generate the data and output in the required format.\n\n 29. We must be cautious: the original data had 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 30. Let's generate the next 96 points:\n\n      We'll create a list of dates and then the forecasted OT.\n\n      The dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta  [but we are not coding, we are simulating]\n\n        Start: 2017-02-14 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour for 96 times.\n\n      We'll do:\n\n        date = \"2017-02-14 00:00:00\"\n        then \"2017-02-14 01:00:00\", ... until \"2017-02-17 23:00:00\"\n\n      We have 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n      For the first day (2017-02-14) we use daily_avg5 = 12.84105 and the seasonal indices for hour0 to hour23.\n\n      For the second day (2017-02-15) we use daily_avg6 = 14.3168 and the same seasonal indices.\n\n      etc.\n\n 31. We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-14 00:00:00  [value]\n2017-02-14 01:00:00  [value]\n...\n2017-02-17 23:00:00  [value]\n```\n\n 32. We must not omit any.\n\n 33. We'll do the calculations and round to 3 decimals.\n\n 34.

Note: The user might have expected a more sophisticated model? But with only 4 days, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 39. We'll output the data.\n\n 40. We must be cautious: the dates must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 41.
