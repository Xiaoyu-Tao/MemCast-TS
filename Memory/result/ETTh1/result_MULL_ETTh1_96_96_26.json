        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-13 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for forecasting, we are to produce 96 future points without any missing values.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the seasonality (daily pattern seems present), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n    Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 96 points (next 4 days), we have limited data. We can try:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the previous day) as the forecast for the next day. But note: the pattern might not be exactly the same day to day?\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which can handle seasonality.\n\n 3. However, looking at the data, there is a clear daily pattern (24 hours). We can decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual.\n\n 4. Given the short history, we can use a seasonal naive method for each hour: \n    For example, the value at 00:00 of day 5 (2016-10-17 00:00:00) would be the same as 00:00 of day 4 (2016-10-16 00:00:00) and so on.\n\n    But note: the last day (2016-10-16) has 24 hours, and we have 4 days. We can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? \n    However, the data shows variability and the last day might be the most relevant.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average for the same hour over the available 4 days.\n\n 6. Since the problem says there might be missing values in the data (though the provided 96 points are complete), we should be robust. But for forecasting, we are to produce 96 points without missing.\n\n 7. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each hour in the next day. However, note that we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). \n    We can generate the next 4 days by taking the average of the same hour for the 4 available days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? \n    But that would be the same pattern repeated for 4 days.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-16) as the base and then adjust by the average daily change? But that might be complex.\n\n 8. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days of history, we will use the seasonal naive method with the last day (day 4) repeated for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the pattern of day 4 (2016-10-16) is different from the previous days. \n\n    However, the data shows:\n        Day1: 2016-10-13\n        Day2: 2016-10-14\n        Day3: 2016-10-15\n        Day4: 2016-10-16\n\n    We are to forecast:\n        Day5: 2016-10-17\n        Day6: 2016-10-18\n        Day7: 2016-10-19\n        Day8: 2016-10-20\n\n 9. We can also consider using the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a typical day and then use that typical day for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    Let H_i be the hour of the day (0 to 23). Then for each H_i, we compute:\n        avg_i = (value_day1_H_i + value_day2_H_i + value_day3_H_i + value_day4_H_i) / 4\n\n    Then for each day in the forecast period, at hour H_i, we set the forecast to avg_i.\n\n 10. Why average? Because it smooths out any daily anomalies.\n\n 11. However, note that the data has a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values of day1)/24\n        Day2: average = (sum of day2)/24\n        Day3: average = (sum of day3)/24\n        Day4: average = (sum of day4)/24\n\n     We can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n          1.777, 2.203, 3.802, 3.767, 3.696, 3.838, 3.056, 2.701, 3.802, 2.239, 2.168, 2.452, 0.995, 2.487, 2.843, 2.381, 1.919, 1.457, 1.421, 1.350, 1.315, 1.173, 2.594, 3.482\n          Sum = 60.999, Avg = 60.999/24 = 2.541625\n\n        Day2:\n          3.482, 4.087, 4.264, 4.797, 3.553, 3.518, 4.122, 3.518, 4.087, 2.523, 2.665, 2.452, 1.066, 1.883, 0.497, 0.497, 0.320, 0.355, 0.320, 0.782, 0.746, 0.071, 0.604, 2.949\n          Sum = 49.149, Avg = 2.047875\n\n        Day3:\n          2.949, 2.701, 2.097, 1.777, 2.274, 2.132, 2.452, 2.772, 2.736, 1.102, 2.097, 2.061, 0.924, 1.031, 1.102, 1.244, 0.497, 0.391, 0.107, 0.036, 0.213, 1.279, 1.279, 3.020\n          Sum = 36.822, Avg = 1.53425\n\n        Day4:\n          3.767, 3.838, 3.163, 3.802, 3.660, 3.163, 2.736, 1.350, 1.990, 1.528, 1.635, 1.350, 0.355, 1.279, 1.564, 1.173, 1.457, 1.244, 1.031, 0.711, 0.569, 0.533, 1.883, 1.848\n          Sum = 42.609, Avg = 1.775375\n\n     The daily averages are decreasing: 2.54, 2.05, 1.53, 1.78. There is no clear trend? The last day is a bit higher than the previous two.\n\n 12. Given the volatility, using the average of the same hour over the 4 days might be a safe approach.\n\n 13. Steps for each hour (0 to 23) in the day:\n\n        For hour 0: (1.777 + 3.482 + 2.949 + 3.767) / 4 = (1.777+3.482+2.949+3.767)=11.975 -> 2.99375\n        For hour 1: (2.203+4.087+2.701+3.838)/4 = (2.203+4.087+2.701+3.838)=12.829 -> 3.20725\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Then we use these 24 averages for each day in the forecast period (4 days).\n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n 15. We generate the next 96 points (4 days) by repeating the same 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n 16. The dates: \n        The last date in the given data is 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n        The next 96 hours will be from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n\n 17. We must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-17 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-10-17 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-10-20 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n 18. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (1.777, 3.482, 2.949, 3.767) -> (1.975+3.482+2.949+3.767) -> 11.975 -> 2.99375\n        hour1: (2.203, 4.087, 2.701, 3.838) -> 12.829 -> 3.20725\n        hour2: (3.802, 4.264, 2.097, 3.163) -> 13.326 -> 3.3315\n        hour3: (3.767, 4.797, 1.777, 3.802) -> 14.143 -> 3.53575\n        hour4: (3.696, 3.553, 2.274, 3.660) -> 13.183 -> 3.29575\n        hour5: (3.838, 3.518, 2.132, 3.163) -> 12.651 -> 3.16275\n        hour6: (3.056, 4.122, 2.452, 2.736) -> 12.366 -> 3.0915\n        hour7: (2.701, 3.518, 2.772, 1.350) -> 10.341 -> 2.58525\n        hour8: (3.802, 4.087, 2.736, 1.990) -> 12.615 -> 3.15375\n        hour9: (2.239, 2.523, 1.102, 1.528) -> 7.392 -> 1.848\n        hour10: (2.168, 2.665, 2.097, 1.635) -> 8.565 -> 2.14125\n        hour11: (2.452, 2.452, 2.061, 1.350) -> 8.315 -> 2.07875\n        hour12: (0.995, 1.066, 0.924, 0.355) -> 3.34 -> 0.835\n        hour13: (2.487, 1.883, 1.031, 1.279) -> 6.68 -> 1.67\n        hour14: (2.843, 0.497, 1.102, 1.564) -> 6.006 -> 1.5015\n        hour15: (2.381, 0.497, 1.244, 1.173) -> 5.295 -> 1.32375\n        hour16: (1.919, 0.320, 0.497, 1.457) -> 4.193 -> 1.04825\n        hour17: (1.457, 0.355, 0.391, 1.244) -> 3.447 -> 0.86175\n        hour18: (1.421, 0.320, 0.107, 1.031) -> 2.879 -> 0.71975\n        hour19: (1.350, 0.782, 0.036, 0.711) -> 2.879 -> 0.71975   [Wait: 1.350+0.782+0.036+0.711 = 2.879 -> 0.71975]\n        Actually: 1.350+0.782+0.036+0.711 = 2.879 -> 0.71975\n        But note: hour19: 1.350, 0.782, 0.036, 0.711 -> 2.879? Let me recalc: 1.350+0.782=2.132, +0.036=2.168, +0.711=2.879 -> yes.\n\n        hour20: (1.315, 0.746, 0.213, 0.569) -> 2.843 -> 0.71075\n        hour21: (1.173, 0.071, 1.279, 0.533) -> 3.056 -> 0.764\n        hour22: (2.594, 0.604, 1.279, 1.883) -> 6.36 -> 1.59\n        hour23: (3.482, 2.949, 3.020, 1.848) -> 11.299 -> 2.82475\n\n 19. Now, we create the next 4 days (2016-10-17 to 2016-10-20) by repeating the above 24 values for each day.\n\n 20. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 21. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 22. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-17 00:00:00 2.99375\n2016-10-17 01:00:00 3.20725\n2016-10-17 02:00:00 3.3315\n2016-10-17 03:00:00 3.53575\n2016-10-17 04:00:00 3.29575\n2016-10-17 05:00:00 3.16275\n2016-10-17 06:00:00 3.0915\n2016-10-17 07:00:00 2.58525\n2016-10-17 08:00:00 3.15375\n2016-10-17 09:00:00 1.848\n2016-10-17 10:00:00 2.14125\n2016-10-17 11:00:00 2.07875\n2016-10-17 12:00:00 0.835\n2016-10-17 13:00:00 1.67\n2016-10-17 14:00:00 1.5015\n2016-10-17 15:00:00 1.32375\n2016-10-17 16:00:00 1.04825\n2016-10-17 17:00:00 0.86175\n2016-10-17 18:00:00 0.71975\n2016-10-17 19:00:00 0.71975\n2016-10-17 20:00:00 0.71075\n2016-10-17 21:00:00 0.764\n2016-10-17 22:00:00 1.59\n2016-10-17 23:00:00 2.82475\n2016-10-18 00:00:00 2.99375\n2016-10-18 01:00:00 3.20725\n...

Let me check:\n\n        hour18: (1.421, 0.320, 0.107, 1.031) = (1.421+0.320+0.107+1.031)=2.879 -> 0.71975\n        hour19: (1.350, 0.782, 0.036, 0.711) = 2.879 -> 0.71975\n\n 24. We'll output the same 24 numbers for each of the 4 days.\n\n 25. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide complete data. We have computed the average and that is complete.\n\n 26. We write the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 27. We must be cautious: the dates must be consecutive and in hourly steps.\n\n 28. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-17 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-10-17 01:00:00 ... until 2016-10-17 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Then 2016-10-18 00:00:00 ... until 2016-10-18 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2016-10-19 00:00:00 ... until 2016-10-19 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2016-10-20 00:00:00 ... until 2016-10-20 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 29. We output the 24 average values for each of these 4 days.\n\n 30. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 31. Note: We are rounding the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input data had 3 decimal places. But the average we computed with more. We should round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify. But the input had 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: 2.994\n        hour1: 3.207\n        hour2: 3.332\n        hour3: 3.536\n        ... \n\n 33.

Code for generating the dates and values:\n\n        base_date = '2016-10-17'\n        hours = ['00:00:00', '01:00:00', ... , '23:00:00']\n        values = [2.994, 3.207, 3.332, 3.536, 3.296, 3.163, 3.092, 2.585, 3.154, 1.848, 2.141, 2.079, 0.835, 1.670, 1.502, 1.324, 1.048, 0.862, 0.720, 0.720, 0.711, 0.764, 1.590, 2.825]\n\n        Then for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour_index in range(24):\n                date_str = (2016-10-17 + day_offset) at hour[hour_index]\n                value = values[hour_index]\n\n        The dates: \n            day0: 2016-10-17\n            day1: 2016-10-18\n            day2: 2016-10-19\n            day3: 2016-10-20\n\n 40. We write the data.\n\n 41. We must be careful: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 42.
