        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, we don't see explicit NaNs. However, the problem states there might be missing values. \n    In the given data, we see that on 2017-01-31, the value is constant (7.604) for 24 hours. This might be an anomaly or missing data imputed with a constant? \n    But since we are to forecast the next 96 points, we must handle the given data appropriately.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n 3. Considering the data length (only 96 points) and the need for 96 forecasts, we might use models like:\n    - ARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because of the hourly data and potential daily seasonality (24 hours).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) for seasonality.\n    - Alternatively, a simple model like a seasonal naive or moving average might be considered, but we want accuracy.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows a daily pattern (with peaks in the evening and troughs in the early morning) but also has anomalies (like the constant day).\n\n 5. We must be cautious: the data on 2017-01-31 is constant. This might be an error. But without more context, we have to use the data as is.\n\n 6. We will use a model that can handle seasonality. Let's try to fit a Seasonal ARIMA model. The seasonality period is 24 (for daily seasonality).\n\n 7. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We need to determine the order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,s) where s=24.\n    - Due to the limited data (only 4 days) and the anomaly on the 3rd day, we might not have enough data to fit a complex model.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: a seasonal naive model that uses the value from the same time in the previous day. \n    But note: the last day (2017-02-01) is the most recent and the day before that (2017-01-31) is constant, which might not be representative.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the non-anomalous days (2017-01-29, 2017-01-30, and 2017-02-01) for each hour to form a daily profile, then adjust by the last day's trend?\n\n 10. However, the problem requires a forecast and we must provide 96 points. We must also be cautious of the constant day.\n\n 11. Approach:\n     - We note that the data from 2017-01-31 is constant. This might be an error. We might consider it as missing and impute with a method, but the problem says we are to forecast the next 96 and the given data has missing values? \n        Actually, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but in the provided 96 points we don't see any NaN. The constant might be the issue.\n\n     - We decide to treat the constant day (2017-01-31) as an anomaly and replace it by the average of the same hour from the other days? \n        But we only have two other days (2017-01-29 and 2017-01-30) and then 2017-02-01 is the next day. However, 2017-02-01 is the day after the constant day and we don't know if it is complete.\n\n     - Alternatively, we can use the data as is and hope the model can handle the anomaly.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the small data, we choose to use a simple method: \n        - Use the last available day (2017-02-01) as the base pattern and then adjust by the overall level of the series? \n        But we need 4 days of forecast.\n\n 13. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern. We can compute the daily profile from the non-anomalous days and then project forward.\n\n 14. Steps for the simple method:\n        a. Identify the anomaly: 2017-01-31 is constant 7.604 for all hours. We mark that day as unreliable.\n        b. We form a daily profile by averaging the same hour of the days: 2017-01-29, 2017-01-30, and 2017-02-01 (excluding 2017-01-31).\n        c. However, the level of the series might be changing. We can take the last day (2017-02-01) and use its daily pattern, but then we only have one day.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the median of the three days for each hour to form a daily profile.\n\n 16. Then, for the forecast, we will use this daily profile for the next 4 days (96 hours). But we need to adjust the level? \n        The level of the last day (2017-02-01) might be different from the previous days. We can compute the average of the last day and the average of the profile and then shift the profile by the difference.\n\n 17. Steps:\n        - Form a base profile: for each hour (0 to 23), compute the median (or mean) of the values at that hour from the three days: 2017-01-29, 2017-01-30, and 2017-02-01.\n        - Let base_profile[hour] = median(value at that hour for the three days)\n\n        - Compute the average of the last day (2017-02-01) and the average of the base_profile.\n        - Let last_day_avg = average of the 24 hours of 2017-02-01\n        - base_profile_avg = average of the 24 values in base_profile\n\n        - Then, the adjusted_profile = base_profile * (last_day_avg / base_profile_avg)   [multiplicative adjustment] \n          OR adjusted_profile = base_profile + (last_day_avg - base_profile_avg)   [additive adjustment]\n\n        - We choose additive because the data does not show multiplicative seasonality? Let's check the range: \n            The values vary from negative to positive. Multiplicative might not be suitable. So we use additive.\n\n        - Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is the adjusted_profile repeated 4 times.\n\n 18. But note: the last day (2017-02-01) is the most recent and might be the best indicator of the current level. We can also consider using the last day's pattern without averaging? \n        However, the last day might have noise. The averaging over three days might be more robust.\n\n 19. Let's do:\n\n        base_profile = []\n        for hour in range(24):\n            values = []\n            # 2017-01-29: first 24 points\n            values.append(data[hour]['MUFL'])\n            # 2017-01-30: next 24 points (index 24 to 47)\n            values.append(data[24+hour]['MUFL'])\n            # 2017-02-01: last 24 points (index 72 to 95) because 96 points: 4 days * 24 = 96\n            values.append(data[72+hour]['MUFL'])\n            base_profile.append(median(values))\n\n        Then compute:\n        last_day_avg = average of data[72:96]   # last 24 points\n        base_profile_avg = average(base_profile)\n\n        adjustment = last_day_avg - base_profile_avg\n\n        adjusted_profile = [x + adjustment for x in base_profile]\n\n        Then the next 96 hours: we repeat adjusted_profile 4 times.\n\n 20. However, note that the data for 2017-01-31 (index 48 to 71) is constant and we are excluding it. This is acceptable.\n\n 21. But what if the level is changing? We are using the last day to adjust the profile. This should capture the recent level.\n\n 22. Let's code accordingly.\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. We are not seeing missing in the provided 96, but in the forecast we must provide complete data.\n\n 24. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n\n 25. Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Parse the given data (96 points) into a list of dictionaries or a DataFrame.\n\n        Step 2: Extract the three days: \n            day0: indices 0-23 -> 2017-01-29\n            day1: indices 24-47 -> 2017-01-30\n            day2: indices 48-71 -> 2017-01-31 (anomaly, skip)\n            day3: indices 72-95 -> 2017-02-01\n\n        Step 3: For each hour (0 to 23), take the values from day0, day1, day3 and compute the median.\n\n        Step 4: Compute the average of the last day (day3, indices 72-95) and the average of the base_profile (the 24 values).\n\n        Step 5: Compute the adjustment = (average of day3) - (average of base_profile)\n\n        Step 6: adjusted_profile = [median_value + adjustment for each hour]\n\n        Step 7: The forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is: \n            day4: adjusted_profile (for 2017-02-02)\n            day5: adjusted_profile (for 2017-02-03)\n            day6: adjusted_profile (for 2017-02-04)\n            day7: adjusted_profile (for 2017-02-05)\n\n 26. However, what if there is a trend? We are not accounting for trend. But with only 4 days and one of them being constant, it's hard to model trend. \n        We are using the level of the last day to adjust, so it should be acceptable.\n\n 27. Let's calculate:\n\n        Given data: 96 points.\n\n        We break into 4 days of 24 hours.\n\n        Day0: 2017-01-29: indices 0-23\n        Day1: 2017-01-30: indices 24-47\n        Day2: 2017-01-31: indices 48-71 -> skip\n        Day3: 2017-02-01: indices 72-95\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00:00):\n            values = [5.686 (day0), 6.148 (day1), 6.823 (day3)] -> median: sort: 5.686, 6.148, 6.823 -> median=6.148\n        hour 1: [4.620, 5.188, 5.792] -> sort: 4.620, 5.188, 5.792 -> median=5.188\n        ... and so on.\n\n        Then, average of day3 (2017-02-01): \n            values = [6.823, 5.792, 5.010, 4.584, 4.477, 4.442, 4.620, 5.437, 7.747, 6.716, 3.589, 3.696, 4.051, 5.366, 5.188, 5.437, 6.752, 8.138, 8.777, 10.554, 11.300, 11.371, 10.518, 8.955]\n            We can compute the average: \n        Let me compute the average of day3:\n            Sum = 6.823+5.792+5.010+4.584+4.477+4.442+4.620+5.437+7.747+6.716+3.589+3.696+4.051+5.366+5.188+5.437+6.752+8.138+8.777+10.554+11.300+11.371+10.518+8.955\n            = 6.823+5.792=12.615, +5.010=17.625, +4.584=22.209, +4.477=26.686, +4.442=31.128, +4.620=35.748, +5.437=41.185, +7.747=48.932, +6.716=55.648, +3.589=59.237, +3.696=62.933, +4.051=66.984, +5.366=72.35, +5.188=77.538, +5.437=82.975, +6.752=89.727, +8.138=97.865, +8.777=106.642, +10.554=117.196, +11.300=128.496, +11.371=139.867, +10.518=150.385, +8.955=159.34\n            Average = 159.34 / 24 = 6.639166666666667\n\n        Then, base_profile average: we have 24 medians. We need to compute the average of these 24 medians.\n\n        Then adjustment = 6.639166666666667 - (average of base_profile)\n\n        Then adjusted_profile = [each median + adjustment]\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is 4 repetitions of adjusted_profile.\n\n 28. We must generate the timestamps: \n        Start: 2017-02-02 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-02-01 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-02-02 01:00:00, ... until 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll code accordingly.\n\n 30. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not seeing any in the provided 96, so we assume the given 96 are complete. \n        For the forecast, we are generating without missing.\n\n 31.

Let's code the adjusted_profile:\n\n        base_profile = [6.148, 5.188, 4.584, 4.300, 4.158, 4.158, 4.406, 5.437, 7.747, 2.310, -1.315, 2.914, 4.051, 3.873, 5.188, 5.437, 6.752, 7.107, 8.706, 10.554, 11.300, 11.371, 10.127, 8.813]\n        adjustment = 0.66775\n\n        adjusted_profile = [round(x + adjustment, 3) for x in base_profile]\n\n        But note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Then, the forecast for the next 4 days is:\n            day1: adjusted_profile\n            day2: adjusted_profile\n            day3: adjusted_profile\n            day4: adjusted_profile\n\n 38. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-02 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-02 01:00:00, ... until 2017-02-02 23:00:00 -> first 24\n        Then 2017-02-03 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-02-04 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-02-05 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 39. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-02 00:00:00  <value1>\n2017-02-02 01:00:00  <value2>\n...\n2017-02-05 23:00:00  <value96>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 40. Let's compute the adjusted_profile:\n\n        adjusted_profile = [round(x + 0.66775, 3) for x in base_profile]\n\n        We do:\n\n        hour0: 6.148 + 6.6775? -> wait: 6.148 + 0.66775 = 6.81575 -> 6.816 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        hour1: 5.188 + 0.66775 = 5.85575 -> 5.856\n        hour2: 4.584 + 0.66775 = 5.25175 -> 5.252\n        hour3: 4.300 + 0.66775 = 4.96775 -> 4.968\n        hour4: 4.158 + 0.66775 = 4.82575 -> 4.826\n        hour5: 4.158 + 0.66775 = 4.82575 -> 4.826\n        hour6: 4.406 + 0.66775 = 5.07375 -> 5.074\n        hour7: 5.437 + 0.66775 = 6.10475 -> 6.105\n        hour8: 7.747 + 0.66775 = 8.41475 -> 8.415\n        hour9: 2.310 + 0.66775 = 2.97775 -> 2.978\n        hour10: -1.315 + 0.66775 = -0.64725 -> -0.647\n        hour11: 2.914 + 0.66775 = 3.58175 -> 3.582\n        hour12: 4.051 + 0.66775 = 4.71875 -> 4.719\n        hour13: 3.873 + 0.66775 = 4.54075 -> 4.541\n        hour14: 5.188 + 0.66775 = 5.85575 -> 5.856\n        hour15: 5.437 + 0.66775 = 6.10475 -> 6.105\n        hour16: 6.752 + 0.66775 = 7.41975 -> 7.420\n        hour17: 7.107 + 0.66775 = 7.77475 -> 7.775\n        hour18: 8.706 + 0.66775 = 9.37375 -> 9.374\n        hour19: 10.554 + 0.66775 = 11.22175 -> 11.222\n        hour20: 11.300 + 0.66775 = 11.96775 -> 11.968\n        hour21: 11.371 + 0.66775 = 12.03875 -> 12.039\n        hour22: 10.127 + 0.66775 = 10.79475 -> 10.795\n        hour23: 8.813 + 0.66775 = 9.48075 -> 9.481\n\n 41. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-02): [6.816, 5.856, 5.252, 4.968, 9.481] ... (the above 24 numbers)\n        Day2 (2017-02-03): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (2017-02-04): same\n        Day4 (2017-02-05): same\n\n 42. We write the output.\n\n 43. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output 96 lines.\n\n 44. We generate the timestamps:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2017, 2, 0o2, 0,0,0)   # 2017-02-02 00:00:00\n        then add 1 hour for each step.\n\n 45. We don't have to use code in the answer, we can write the 96 lines.\n\n 46. But 96 lines is long, we can write a loop in the answer? But the format requires to write the data.\n\n 47. We'll write the data explicitly.\n\n 48. However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", so we must output 96 lines.\n\n 49. We do:\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                timestamp = start + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # but note: we are starting at 2017-02-02, then add day and hour? Actually, we can do:\n                # base_timestamp = datetime(2017,2,2,0,0,0)\n                # then for i in range(96): timestamp = base_timestamp + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n        We'll generate:\n\n            base = datetime(2017,2,2,0,0,0)\n            for i in range(96):\n                timestamp = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n                value = adjusted_profile[i % 24]\n\n 50. We output in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS {value}\"\n\n 51. But note: the original data had the date as string in the format: \"2017-01-29 00:00:00\"\n\n 52. We'll generate the string representation.\n\n 53. However, we are to output in the same format as the input.\n\n 54. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n 55. But note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the given data is hourly. So we are safe.\n\n 56. We output.\n\n 57. Let's do the adjusted_profile as a list:\n\n        adjusted_profile = [6.816, 5.856, 5.252, 4.968, 4.826, 4.826, 5.074, 6.105, 8.415, 2.978, -0.647, 3.582, 4.719, 4.541, 5.856, 6.105, 7.420, 7.775, 9.374, 11.222, 11.968, 12.039, 10.795, 9.481]\n\n 58. Then for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Hour 0: 2017-02-02 00:00:00 -> 6.816\n        Hour 1: 2017-02-02 01:00:00 -> 5.856\n        ...\n        Hour 23: 2017-02-02 23:00:00 -> 9.481\n        Hour 24: 2017-02-03 00:00:00 -> 6.816\n        ... and so on.\n\n 59. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n 60. But note: we must be cautious of the rounding. We rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 61. We output.\n",
