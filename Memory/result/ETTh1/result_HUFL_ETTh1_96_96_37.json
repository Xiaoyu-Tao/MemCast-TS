        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00.\n We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any missing value in the given segment.\n\n However, the problem states that the dataset may have missing values. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we assume that the missing values are in the future part we are to forecast? \n But the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". It might be referring to the entire dataset, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note the frequency is hourly.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use an appropriate model. Given the limited data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or \n   - Seasonal decomposition with STL and then forecast the components, or \n   - ARIMA/SARIMA.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - A daily seasonality (24 hours) because the pattern repeats every day? Let's check:\n\n   Looking at the data: \n     Each day starts with a relatively high value at 00:00, then decreases until around 12:00 to 15:00, then increases again in the evening? \n     But the pattern is not very clear and there is a weekend effect? (26th and 27th are Saturday and Sunday, 28th and 29th are Monday and Tuesday).\n\n   We have only 4 days of data. This is very limited for capturing weekly seasonality (which would require at least one full week of data to capture, and multiple weeks to model).\n\n 3. Given the short history, we might consider a model that uses daily seasonality (24 periods) and possibly non-seasonal components.\n\n 4. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must not omit any.\n\n 5. We must account for the possibility of missing values? But the problem says the data we are given might have missing values? However, the provided 96 points are complete. \n    So for the forecasting, we assume the model we build can handle missing values? But since we are only given 96 points without missing values, we can proceed.\n\n 6. We choose a model: \n    Given the seasonality and the short history, we can use:\n        - SARIMA: but with 96 points, we can try to fit a model with daily seasonality (s=24). However, the model might be complex and require many parameters.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: \n        - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive or multiplicative seasonality). Since the seasonality does not seem to change in amplitude, we can try additive.\n\n 7. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n        - We have 4 days (96 hours) of data. We set seasonality to 24.\n        - We fit the model and then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 8. However, note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-26: values from 13.7 down to 6.7 and then up to 9.2\n        Day 2: 2016-11-27: starts at 10.9, then down to 7.5 and then up to 11.6\n        Day 3: 2016-11-28: starts at 14.3, then down to 7.1 and then up to 11.5\n        Day 4: 2016-11-29: starts at 14.2, then down to 6.3 and then up to 8.9\n\n    The starting point of each day (midnight) is: \n        26: 13.73, 27: 10.91, 28: 14.33, 29: 14.26 -> no clear trend.\n\n    The minimums during the day: \n        26: 6.76, 27: 7.50, 28: 7.16, 29: 6.36 -> no clear trend.\n\n    So we might assume a constant level? \n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 4 days (same length as the history), we might use a seasonal naive method? \n    But the problem says we are experts, so we should use a more sophisticated model.\n\n 10. We decide to use Holt-Winters additive method with a seasonality of 24.\n\n 11. Implementation in code would be:\n\n        from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing\n\n        model = ExponentialSmoothing(series, seasonal_periods=24, trend='add', seasonal='add')\n        model_fit = model.fit()\n        forecast = model_fit.forecast(96)\n\n 12. However, we are not running code but providing the forecast. We must simulate the output.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We are to output the dates and the forecasted values.\n\n 14. Since we cannot run code here, we have to describe the method and then provide the forecast. But the problem requires the complete data.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: average the last 4 days and use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n     But that would be a seasonal forecast with a naive approach.\n\n     Steps for naive seasonal forecast for the next 96 hours:\n\n     Let the historical data be in a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours). \n        Day1: 2016-11-26: indices 0-23\n        Day2: 2016-11-27: indices 24-47\n        Day3: 2016-11-28: indices 48-71\n        Day4: 2016-11-29: indices 72-95\n\n     Then for each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? \n        But note: the data for day1 (Saturday), day2 (Sunday), day3 (Monday), day4 (Tuesday). \n        The next 4 days would be: \n          2016-11-30: Wednesday\n          2016-12-01: Thursday\n          2016-12-02: Friday\n          2016-12-03: Saturday\n\n        We don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality. So we ignore the day of the week and just use the daily pattern.\n\n     We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (13.731 + 10.918 + 14.334 + 14.267) / 4 = (13.731+10.918=24.649; +14.334=38.983; +14.267=53.25) -> 53.25/4 = 13.3125\n        hour1: (12.994 + 11.454 + 14.803 + 14.334) / 4 = (12.994+11.454=24.448; +14.803=39.251; +14.334=53.585) -> 53.585/4 = 13.39625\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be:\n\n        Day5 (2016-11-30): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day6 (2016-12-01): same as above\n        Day7 (2016-12-02): same as above\n        Day8 (2016-12-03): same as above\n\n     But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told that the future has missing values, but we are to forecast the complete 96 points.\n\n 16. However, the naive seasonal average might not capture the possible trend? But we don't see a clear trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-29) as the base and then adjust by the average daily pattern? \n     But the problem says we are experts, so we should use a more robust method.\n\n 18. Given the constraints, we choose the seasonal average method because it is simple and we have exactly 4 days.\n\n 19. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (13.731, 10.918, 14.334, 14.267) -> 13.3125\n        hour1: (12.994, 11.454, 14.803, 14.334) -> 13.39625\n        hour2: (11.788, 10.114, 13.798, 13.530) -> (11.788+10.114=21.902; +13.798=35.7; +13.530=49.23) -> 12.3075\n        hour3: (12.458, 10.047, 13.195, 13.731) -> (12.458+10.047=22.505; +13.195=35.7; +13.731=49.431) -> 12.35775\n        hour4: (11.320, 10.650, 13.128, 14.535) -> (11.320+10.650=21.97; +13.128=35.098; +14.535=49.633) -> 12.40825\n        hour5: (12.994, 11.119, 13.798, 12.726) -> (12.994+11.119=24.113; +13.798=37.911; +12.726=50.637) -> 12.65925\n        hour6: (13.463, 10.047, 14.401, 14.669) -> (13.463+10.047=23.51; +14.401=37.911; +14.669=52.58) -> 13.145\n        hour7: (12.257, 13.195, 16.678, 16.008) -> (12.257+13.195=25.452; +16.678=42.13; +16.008=58.138) -> 14.5345\n        hour8: (13.597, 12.860, 13.999, 11.788) -> (13.597+12.860=26.457; +13.999=40.456; +11.788=52.244) -> 13.061\n        hour9: (10.784, 8.640, 8.707, 8.908) -> (10.784+8.640=19.424; +8.707=28.131; +8.908=37.039) -> 9.25975\n        hour10: (9.846, 9.578, 9.109, 7.770) -> (9.846+9.578=19.424; +9.109=28.533; +7.770=36.303) -> 9.07575\n        hour11: (10.382, 9.444, 9.578, 8.038) -> (10.382+9.444=19.826; +9.578=29.404; +8.038=37.442) -> 9.3605\n        hour12: (7.770, 7.502, 7.368, 6.564) -> (7.770+7.502=15.272; +7.368=22.64; +6.564=29.204) -> 7.301\n        hour13: (8.372, 7.569, 8.439, 6.162) -> (8.372+7.569=15.941; +8.439=24.38; +6.162=30.542) -> 7.6355\n        hour14: (8.172, 8.573, 9.310, 6.631) -> (8.172+8.573=16.745; +9.310=26.055; +6.631=32.686) -> 8.1715\n        hour15: (7.904, 9.176, 8.841, 6.430) -> (7.904+9.176=17.08; +8.841=25.921; +6.430=32.351) -> 8.08775\n        hour16: (7.904, 8.506, 8.506, 6.631) -> (7.904+8.506=16.41; +8.506=24.916; +6.631=31.547) -> 7.88675\n        hour17: (8.908, 9.444, 9.578, 8.372) -> (8.908+9.444=18.352; +9.578=27.93; +8.372=36.302) -> 9.0755\n        hour18: (9.846, 8.774, 8.774, 8.172) -> (9.846+8.774=18.62; +8.774=27.394; +8.172=35.566) -> 8.8915\n        hour19: (8.439, 9.109, 8.573, 8.105) -> (8.439+9.109=17.548; +8.573=26.121; +8.105=34.226) -> 8.5565\n        hour20: (8.038, 7.502, 7.569, 7.368) -> (8.038+7.502=15.54; +7.569=23.109; +7.368=30.477) -> 7.61925\n        hour21: (7.033, 7.636, 7.167, 6.564) -> (7.033+7.636=14.669; +7.167=21.836; +6.564=28.4) -> 7.1\n        hour22: (6.765, 9.712, 10.047, 6.363) -> (6.765+9.712=16.477; +10.047=26.524; +6.363=32.887) -> 8.22175\n        hour23: (9.243, 11.655, 11.588, 8.975) -> (9.243+11.655=20.898; +11.588=32.486; +8.975=41.461) -> 10.36525\n\n 20. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day5: 2016-11-30 00:00:00 -> 13.3125\n               2016-11-30 01:00:00 -> 13.39625\n               ... until hour23: 10.36525\n\n        Day6: 2016-12-01 00:00:00 -> 13.3125\n               2016-12-01 01:00:00 -> 13.39625\n               ... same pattern\n\n        Day7: 2016-12-02: same pattern\n\n        Day8: 2016-12-03: same pattern\n\n 21. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-30 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-11-29 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-11-30 01:00:00 ... up to 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We write the data in the same format.\n\n 23. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are to provide the complete data. We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n 24. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 25. But note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We will output with 6 decimal places as in the input? The input had 3, but we can output with 3.\n\n 26. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 27. Let's do it:\n\n        We have 96 rows.\n\n        Example first row: \n          2016-11-30 00:00:00, 13.3125 -> 13.313 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n        But note: the input had 3 decimal places, but the numbers were given with 6? Actually, they were given with 6 digits but only 3 are significant? \n        We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 28. We compute the averages and round to 29. However, we must be cautious: the average might have more than 3 decimal places. We round to 3.\n\n 30. We list the 24 hourly averages (rounded to 3 decimal places):\n\n        hour0: 13.3125 -> 13.313\n        hour1: 13.39625 -> 13.396\n        hour2: 12.3075 -> 12.308\n        hour3: 12.35775 -> 12.358\n        hour4: 12.40825 -> 12.408\n        hour5: 12.65925 -> 12.659\n        hour6: 13.145 -> 13.145\n        hour7: 14.5345 -> 14.535\n        hour8: 13.061 -> 13.061\n        hour9: 9.25975 -> 9.260\n        hour10: 9.07575 -> 9.076\n        hour11: 9.3605 -> 9.361\n        hour12: 7.301 -> 7.301\n        hour13: 7.6355 -> 7.636\n        hour14: 8.1715 -> 8.172\n        hour15: 8.08775 -> 8.088\n        hour16: 7.88675 -> 7.887\n        hour17: 9.0755 -> 9.076\n        hour18: 8.8915 -> 8.892\n        hour19: 8.5565 -> 8.557\n        hour20: 7.61925 -> 7.619\n        hour21: 7.1 -> 7.100   (but note: 7.1 is 7.100)\n        hour22: 8.22175 -> 8.222\n        hour23: 10.36525 -> 10.365\n\n 31.

But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the history, and we are forecasting without missing values. \n     This method is simple and provides a complete forecast.\n\n 35. We output the above.\n\n However, note: the problem says the dataset is subdivided into four mini-datasets and sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes. We are given hourly data.\n\n We are confident that the seasonal naive average over 4 days is a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
