        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can use a seasonal time series model.\n 2. Given the small size of data for 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days ahead, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend.\n 3. Since the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the next 96 might have. However, the instruction says to provide the complete data for the next 96. So we will generate 96 points without missing values.\n\n Approach:\n We can use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. We'll try to find the best parameters by analyzing the data.\n\n However, note: We are only given 96 points (4 days) to forecast the next 96. This is a very short history. We might also consider a simple seasonal naive model or exponential smoothing.\n\n But let's analyze the data pattern:\n\n - The data shows a daily pattern: lower values during the night and higher during the day, but also with some variability.\n - We can see that the values at the same hour of the day are somewhat similar.\n\n Given the short history, we can use a seasonal naive approach: \n   Forecast each hour of the next day by taking the same hour from the previous day (or average of the same hour over the available days).\n\n However, we have 4 days of history. We can compute the average for each hour of the day and use that for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for a simple method:\n   Step 1: Group by hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n   Step 2: Since we need 4 days (96 hours) of forecast, we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the data does not have a strong trend in the 4 days? Let's check the first and last day:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-05-17): min ~0.822, max ~1.432\n   Day 2 (2017-05-18): min ~0.822, max ~1.492\n   Day 3 (2017-05-19): min ~0.944, max ~1.675\n   Day 4 (2017-05-20): min ~0.853, max ~1.614\n\n There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. So using the average per hour might be acceptable.\n\n However, we note that the last day (2017-05-20) has a different pattern? But without more history, we stick to the average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 00:00: (1.005 + 0.822 + 1.675 + 1.523) / 4 = (1.005+0.822=1.827; 1.827+1.675=3.502; 3.502+1.523=5.025) -> 5.025/4 = 1.25625\n   Similarly for the rest.\n\n But note: the data has 4 days, so we have 4 values for each hour.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data has a pattern that might be influenced by the day of the week? But we only have from Wednesday (2017-05-17) to Saturday (2017-05-20). The next 4 days are Sunday to Wednesday? \n\n Since we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality, we ignore it.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the pattern for the next day (Sunday) and then use the average for the rest? But we don't have a Sunday in the history.\n\n Given the constraints, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Create a list of 24 average values (for 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00).\n\n   Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n   We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00): \n        Day1: 1.005, Day2: 0.822, Day3: 1.675, Day4: 1.523 -> average = (1.005+0.822+1.675+1.523)/4 = 5.025/4 = 1.25625\n\n   Similarly for hour 1 (01:00): \n        Day1: 1.005, Day2: 0.853, Day3: 1.523, Day4: 1.492 -> (1.005+0.853+1.523+1.492)/4 = 4.873/4 = 1.21825\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll compute all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the data provided is exactly 96 points (4*24). We can reshape the 'LULL' column into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the days.\n\n Let me do the computation:\n\n   data = [ ... ] 96 values.\n\n   We can split into 4 chunks of 24.\n\n   Then, for each hour index i in 0..23, average = (chunk1[i] + chunk2[i] + chunk3[i] + chunk4[i]) / 4.\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days is the 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n But note: the problem says the next 96 might have missing values? However, we are to provide the complete data. So we will output 96 forecasted values without missing.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the LULL values as a list of 96 numbers.\n\n   Step 2: Reshape to 4 rows and 24 columns.\n\n   Step 3: Compute the mean for each column (each hour) -> we get 24 values.\n\n   Step 4: Repeat this 24-value pattern 4 times to form 96 values.\n\n   Step 5: Format the dates: starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n Let's compute the averages:\n\n   We'll write a small code in mind:\n\n   Day1: indices 0 to 23\n   Day2: 24 to 47\n   Day3: 48 to 71\n   Day4: 72 to 95\n\n   For
