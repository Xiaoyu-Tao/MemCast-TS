        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing entries. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must choose an appropriate time series forecasting method. Given the relatively small data size (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, we can consider:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) because of potential seasonality (daily pattern?).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) if there is seasonality.\n    - Given the data is only 4 days, we might see a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). So we should account for seasonality with a period of 24.\n\n 4. However, note that the data is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short time to capture weekly patterns, but we can try to capture daily patterns.\n\n 5. We will use a seasonal model: SARIMA with a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 6. Steps for modeling:\n    a. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    b. If non-stationary, we may need to difference (both regular and seasonal).\n    c. Select the best parameters (p, d, q) and (P, D, Q, s) where s=24.\n\n 7. But note: we are only given 96 points and we need to forecast 96 points. This is a very challenging task. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model if the data is too short for SARIMA.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model? But with only 96 points, it's hard.\n\n 9. Let's try to visualize the data (in our mind) from the provided numbers. We see:\n    - The temperature fluctuates daily: it goes down at night and up during the day? But note the values:\n        On 2017-02-14: \n          00:00: 10.974, then decreases until 07:00 (7.809), then increases until 17:00 (10.833) and then drops again.\n        Similarly, on 2017-02-15: \n          starts at 7.738 at 00:00, then decreases until 07:00 (7.105) then increases until 14:00 (16.39) and then drops again.\n\n    It seems there is a daily pattern, but the magnitude of the peaks are increasing? Also, note the peak on 2017-02-15 is much higher (16.39) than on 2017-02-14 (10.833). \n\n 10. Given the complexity and the short data, we might use a naive seasonal model: \n     - The last day (2017-02-17) pattern might be repeated? But the values are lower than the previous days.\n\n 11. However, we are to use a more robust method. We will use SARIMA with a grid search for the best parameters, but with such a short series, we might use (1,0,1) for non-seasonal and (0,1,1) for seasonal? \n\n 12. But note: we are in an exam setting and we must provide the forecast. We can use an automated method.\n\n 13. We can use the `pmdarima` library which automatically selects the best SARIMA parameters. However, since we are not running code, we have to simulate the process.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last three days for each hour? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n 15. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by:\n     - Computing the average of each hour of the day for the 4 days we have? But 4 days is too short to average by hour.\n\n 16. Another idea: use the last day (2017-02-17) as the base and adjust by the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 17. We are forced to use a model. We will use a SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,0,24) model? That is a simple model: \n     - Non-seasonal: AR(1)\n     - Seasonal: only a seasonal difference (D=1) and no seasonal AR or MA terms.\n\n 18. But we don't know the parameters. We can try to fit a model with:\n     - d = 0 (because the series does not show a strong trend? but let's check: the mean level changes from day to day, so we might need a seasonal difference to remove the daily pattern?).\n\n 19. We can try a model with:\n     - Order: (1,0,0) and seasonal order: (0,1,0,24) -> but this is equivalent to an AR(1) on the seasonally differenced series (with lag 24).\n\n 20. However, without running the code, we have to make a forecast. Since we are an expert, we must provide the forecast.\n\n 21. Given the complexity and the fact that we are not allowed to run code, we will use a simple method: \n     - We will take the average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day to form a 24-hour profile, and then use that profile for the next 4 days? But the next 4 days might have a different level.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-17) and repeat it 4 times? But the data on 2017-02-17 is lower than the previous days.\n\n 23. We note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly.\n\n 24. We decide to use a weighted average of the last 4 days for each hour, with more weight on the most recent day.\n\n 25. Steps for the weighted average:\n     - For each hour (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from day1 to day4: 2017-02-14 to 2017-02-17).\n     - We assign weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] for the days from oldest to most recent.\n     - Then the forecast for hour h of the next day (2017-02-18) is: \n          forecast_h = 0.1 * (value of h on 2017-02-14) + 0.2 * (value of h on 2017-02-15) + 0.3 * (value of h on 2017-02-16) + 0.4 * (value of h on 2017-02-17)\n\n     - Then we repeat the same for the next 4 days? But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So we can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days? \n\n 26. However, we might want to account for a trend? We can compute the overall level of the last 4 days and project a linear trend? But 4 points are too short.\n\n 27. We decide to use the same daily pattern for the next 4 days, but the level might be increasing? Looking at the data, the peak on 2017-02-15 was 16.39, then on 2017-02-16 was 16.67, and on 2017-02-17 the peak was only 8.58? That doesn't show a clear trend. Actually, 2017-02-17 is much lower. So we cannot assume a trend.\n\n 28. Therefore, we will use the weighted average for each hour and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 29. How to compute the weighted average for each hour:\n\n     Let the data be:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-14 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day2: 2017-02-15 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day3: 2017-02-16 (index 48 to 71)\n        Day4: 2017-02-17 (index 72 to 95)\n\n     For hour 0 (00:00): \n        values = [10.974 (index0), 7.738 (index24), 13.014 (index48), 15.054 (index72)]\n        weighted_avg = 0.1*10.974 + 0.2*7.738 + 0.3*13.014 + 0.4*15.054 = \n            = 1.0974 + 1.5476 + 3.9042 + 6.0216 = 12.5708\n\n     Similarly, we compute for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n 30. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-02-18, 2017-02-19, 2017-02-20, 2017-02-21) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 31. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are to forecast the next 96 points without missing values.\n\n 32. We generate the next 96 timestamps: \n        Start from 2017-02-18 00:00:00, then every hour until 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n 33. We compute the 24-hour profile and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 34. However, we must be cautious: the pattern on 2017-02-17 is very different (much lower) than the previous days. So the weighted average might be pulled down by the last day.\n\n 35. Alternatively, we can use the median? But we are using weights to emphasize the most recent day.\n\n 36. We will proceed with the weighted average.\n\n 37. Let's compute the 24-hour profile:\n\n     Hour0: 0.1*10.974 + 0.2*7.738 + 0.3*13.014 + 0.4*15.054 = 12.5708\n     Hour1: 0.1*10.411 + 0.2*7.386 + 0.3*12.662 + 0.4*16.461 = \n             1.0411 + 1.4772 + 3.7986 + 6.5844 = 12.9013\n     Hour2: 0.1*10.200 + 0.2*7.105 + 0.3*12.944 + 0.4*12.733 = \n             1.0200 + 1.4210 + 3.8832 + 5.0932 = 11.4174\n     Hour3: 0.1*9.286 + 0.2*7.105 + 0.3*12.029 + 0.4*12.240 = \n             0.9286 + 1.4210 + 3.6087 + 4.8960 = 10.8543\n     Hour4: 0.1*9.075 + 0.2*7.879 + 0.3*12.100 + 0.4*13.999 = \n             0.9075 + 1.5758 + 3.6300 + 5.5996 = 11.7129\n     Hour5: 0.1*8.301 + 0.2*7.527 + 0.3*10.833 + 0.4*12.944 = \n             0.8301 + 1.5054 + 3.2499 + 5.1776 = 10.7630\n     Hour6: 0.1*7.879 + 0.2*6.964 + 0.3*12.662 + 0.4*11.818 = \n             0.7879 + 1.3928 + 3.7986 + 4.7272 = 10.7065\n     Hour7: 0.1*7.809 + 0.2*7.105 + 0.3*12.240 + 0.4*10.693 = \n             0.7809 + 1.4210 + 3.6720 + 4.2772 = 10.1511\n     Hour8: 0.1*8.301 + 0.2*8.793 + 0.3*11.467 + 0.4*9.638 = \n             0.8301 + 1.7586 + 3.4401 + 3.8552 = 9.8840\n     Hour9: 0.1*8.512 + 0.2*9.286 + 0.3*10.833 + 0.4*8.301 = \n             0.8512 + 1.8572 + 3.2499 + 3.3204 = 9.2787\n     Hour10: 0.1*8.723 + 0.2*9.989 + 0.3*11.959 + 0.4*8.512 = \n             0.8723 + 1.9978 + 3.5877 + 3.4048 = 9.8626\n     Hour11: 0.1*9.778 + 0.2*12.944 + 0.3*13.647 + 0.4*7.527 = \n             0.9778 + 2.5888 + 4.0941 + 3.0108 = 10.6715\n     Hour12: 0.1*9.286 + 0.2*13.788 + 0.3*14.773 + 0.4*7.809 = \n             0.9286 + 2.7576 + 4.4319 + 3.1236 = 11.2417\n     Hour13: 0.1*9.989 + 0.2*14.140 + 0.3*15.828 + 0.4*6.894 = \n             0.9989 + 2.8280 + 4.7484 + 2.7576 = 11.3329\n     Hour14: 0.1*10.271 + 0.2*16.391001 + 0.3*14.491 + 0.4*7.597 = \n             1.0271 + 3.2782 + 4.3473 + 3.0388 = 11.6914\n     Hour15: 0.1*9.849 + 0.2*14.069 + 0.3*13.577 + 0.4*7.668 = \n             0.9849 + 2.8138 + 4.0731 + 3.0672 = 10.9390\n     Hour16: 0.1*10.482 + 0.2*14.491 + 0.3*13.788 + 0.4*7.105 = \n             1.0482 + 2.8982 + 4.1364 + 2.8420 = 10.9248\n     Hour17: 0.1*10.833 + 0.2*16.320999 + 0.3*14.351 + 0.4*6.753 = \n             1.0833 + 3.2642 + 4.3053 + 2.7012 = 11.3540\n     Hour18: 0.1*10.833 + 0.2*15.265 + 0.3*16.461 + 0.4*7.035 = \n             1.0833 + 3.0530 + 4.9383 + 2.8140 = 11.8886\n     Hour19: 0.1*9.286 + 0.2*14.140 + 0.3*16.250 + 0.4*7.597 = \n             0.9286 + 2.8280 + 4.8750 + 3.0388 = 11.6704\n     Hour20: 0.1*9.004 + 0.2*13.296 + 0.3*16.320999 + 0.4*8.582 = \n             0.9004 + 2.6592 + 4.8963 + 3.4328 = 11.8887\n     Hour21: 0.1*8.020 + 0.2*12.874 + 0.3*16.672001 + 0.4*8.301 = \n             0.8020 + 2.5748 + 5.0016 + 3.3204 = 11.6988\n     Hour22: 0.1*8.301 + 0.2*12.944 + 0.3*15.547 + 0.4*7.386 = \n             0.8301 + 2.5888 + 4.6641 + 2.9544 = 11.0374\n     Hour23: 0.1*7.738 + 0.2*13.085 + 0.3*14.984 + 0.4*7.457 = \n             0.7738 + 2.6170 + 4.4952 + 2.9828 = 10.8688\n\n 38. Now, we have 24 values for the 24 hours. We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 39. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-02-18 to 2017-02-21) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-18): [12.571, 12.901, 11.417, 10.854, 11.713, 10.763, 10.707, 10.151, 9.884, 9.279, 9.863, 10.672, 11.242, 11.333, 11.691, 10.939, 10.925, 11.354, 11.889, 11.670, 11.889, 11.699, 11.037, 10.869]\n        Day2 (2017-02-19): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (2017-02-20): same\n        Day4 (2017-02-21): same\n\n 40. But note: the last day in the data (2017-02-17) was a Friday? and then 2017-02-18 is a Saturday? We don't have information about weekly seasonality, so we assume the same pattern.\n\n 41. We output the next 96 timestamps with the corresponding forecasted OT.\n\n 42. Format the answer as required.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\".
