        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load is typically higher during certain hours (like evening) and lower at others.\n 2. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days ahead, we can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n 3. However, the data has missing values? The provided data does not show any missing values in the given 96 points. But the problem states that the data may have missing values. Since in the provided 96 points there are no missing values, we can proceed to model the time series.\n\n Approach:\n We will use the Exponential Smoothing model from statsmodels, specifically the Holt-Winters method with additive seasonality, because:\n   - The seasonality does not seem to change in amplitude over the short period we have.\n   - The data does not show a strong trend, but we can try additive seasonality.\n\n However, note that we have only 4 days (96 hourly points) and we are forecasting 4 days (96 points). This is a very short series for fitting a seasonal model with 24 seasons (period=24). \n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour across the four days we have. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided segment there are none. So we can compute the average for each hour of the day and use that as the forecast for the next four days.\n\n Steps for the simple average method:\n   - Group the data by the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n   - For each hour, compute the average of the four available values (from the four days).\n   - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat the computed average for each hour.\n\n But note: the data shows some variation from day to day. However, with only 4 days, we cannot capture weekly patterns (like weekend vs weekday) because all 4 days are from Wednesday to Saturday (2016-11-02 is Wednesday, 2016-11-03 Thursday, 2016-11-04 Friday, 2016-11-05 Saturday). The next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (2016-11-06 to 2016-11-09). Therefore, the pattern might change.\n\n However, without more data, we cannot model weekly seasonality. So we will use the average of the available days for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: [ -1.066, -0.457, -0.944, -0.366] -> average = (-1.066 -0.457 -0.944 -0.366)/4 = -0.70825\n   hour1: [ -1.127, -0.487, -1.005, -0.457] -> average = (-1.127 -0.487 -1.005 -0.457)/4 = -0.769\n   ... and so on.\n\n Then, the forecast for:\n   2016-11-06 00:00:00 (which is hour0 of the first forecast day) = -0.70825\n   2016-11-06 01:00:00 = -0.769\n   ... and repeat the same 24-hour pattern for 4 days.\n\n However, we must note that the last day in the given data is Saturday (2016-11-05) and the next day is Sunday (2016-11-06). The pattern for Sunday might be different from the previous days (which were Wednesday to Saturday). But we don't have any Sunday data to compare. So we have to use the same pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the seasonality and any potential trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Let's check the overall level:\n\n   The data ranges from about -1.157 to -0.244. The average of the entire series is about -0.75.\n\n   We can use a seasonal model: the next day's pattern is the same as the average of the previous days.\n\n Since the problem requires 96 points, we will generate the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n Steps:\n\n   1. Extract the hour from the datetime index for each record.\n   2. Group by hour and compute the mean.\n   3. Create the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-11-05 23:00:00) to 2016-11-09 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n   4. For each hour in the forecast period, assign the average value for that hour.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any missing values in the input, so we don't need to impute for the historical data. For the forecast, we are generating all 96 points.\n\n However, if we had missing values in the input, we would have to impute them. But the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a DataFrame for the given data (if we are in code, but note we are to output the forecast without code).\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the averages manually. But 24 averages are to be computed.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour 0: (-1.066 + (-0.457) + (-0.944) + (-0.366)) / 4 = (-2.833) / 4 = -0.70825\n        hour 1: (-1.127 + (-0.487) + (-1.005) + (-0.457)) / 4 = (-3.076) / 4 = -0.769\n        hour 2: (-1.127 + (-0.457) + (-1.005) + (-0.518)) / 4 = (-3.107) / 4 = -0.77675\n        hour 3: (-1.157 + (-0.457) + (-1.036) + (-0.640)) / 4 = (-3.29) / 4 = -0.8225\n        hour 4: (-1.127 + (-0.579) + (-0.975) + (-0.579)) / 4 = (-3.26) / 4 = -0.815\n        hour 5: (-1.097 + (-0.579) + (-1.005) + (-0.640)) / 4 = (-3.321) / 4 = -0.83025\n        hour 6: (-1.066 + (-0.487) + (-1.036) + (-0.487)) / 4 = (-3.076) / 4 = -0.769\n        hour 7: (-0.944 + (-0.274) + (-0.822) + (-0.914)) / 4 = (-2.954) / 4 = -0.7385\n        hour 8: (-0.853 + (-0.244) + (-0.640) + (-0.761)) / 4 = (-2.498) / 4 = -0.6245\n        hour 9: (-0.761 + (-0.487) + (-0.609) + (-0.701)) / 4 = (-2.558) / 4 = -0.6395\n        hour10: (-0.731 + (-0.518) + (-0.426) + (-0.426)) / 4 = (-2.101) / 4 = -0.52525\n        hour11: (-0.701 + (-0.731) + (-0.518) + (-0.579)) / 4 = (-2.529) / 4 = -0.63225\n        hour12: (-0.944 + (-0.761) + (-0.792) + (-0.579)) / 4 = (-3.076) / 4 = -0.769\n        hour13: (-0.853 + (-0.853) + (-0.609) + (-0.731)) / 4 = (-3.046) / 4 = -0.7615\n        hour14: (-0.761 + (-0.640) + (-0.487) + (-0.701)) / 4 = (-2.589) / 4 = -0.64725\n        hour15: (-0.761 + (-0.701) + (-0.609) + (-0.670)) / 4 = (-2.741) / 4 = -0.68525\n        hour16: (-0.731 + (-0.731) + (-0.640) + (-0.640)) / 4 = (-2.742) / 4 = -0.6855\n        hour17: (-0.853 + (-0.914) + (-0.609) + (-0.761)) / 4 = (-3.137) / 4 = -0.78425\n        hour18: (-1.005 + (-0.944) + (-0.701) + (-0.883)) / 4 = (-3.533) / 4 = -0.88325\n        hour19: (-0.914 + (-1.005) + (-0.822) + (-0.883)) / 4 = (-3.624) / 4 = -0.906\n        hour20: (-0.883 + (-1.005) + (-0.944) + (-0.853)) / 4 = (-3.685) / 4 = -0.92125\n        hour21: (-0.975 + (-1.005) + (-1.005) + (-0.944)) / 4 = (-3.929) / 4 = -0.98225\n        hour22: (-1.066 + (-1.005) + (-1.005) + (-1.005)) / 4 = (-4.081) / 4 = -1.02025\n        hour23: (-0.975 + (-0.975) + (-0.914) + (-0.975)) / 4 = (-3.839) / 4 = -0.95975\n\n   Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (Sunday, 2016-11-06): \n            00:00:00 -> hour0: -0.70825\n            01:00:00 -> hour1: -0.769\n            ... until hour23: -0.95975\n\n        Day 2 (Monday, 2016-11-07): same 24 values repeated.\n        Day 3 (Tuesday, 2016-11-08): same 24 values repeated.\n        Day 4 (Wednesday, 2016-11-09): same 24 values repeated.\n\n   We must format the dates correctly.\n\n   The next date after 2016-11-05 23:00:00 is 2016-11-06 00:00:00.\n\n   We generate 96 rows.\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the input has 3 decimal places. We computed averages with more precision, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify rounding. But the input is given with 3 decimals, so we output 3 decimals.\n\n   Let's round the averages:\n\n        hour0: -0.70825 -> -0.708\n        hour1: -0.769   -> -0.769\n        hour2: -0.77675 -> -0.777\n        hour3: -0.8225  -> -0.822\n        hour4: -0.815   -> -0.815\n        hour5: -0.83025 -> -0.830\n        hour6: -0.769   -> -0.769\n        hour7: -0.7385  -> -0.738\n        hour8: -0.6245  -> -0.624\n        hour9: -0.6395  -> -0.640\n        hour10: -0.52525 -> -0.525\n        hour11: -0.63225 -> -0.632\n        hour12: -0.769   -> -0.769\n        hour13: -0.7615  -> -0.761\n        hour14: -0.64725 -> -0.647\n        hour15: -0.68525 -> -0.685\n        hour16: -0.6855  -> -0.686\n        hour17: -0.78425 -> -0.784\n        hour18: -0.88325 -> -0.883\n        hour19: -0.906   -> -0.906\n        hour20: -0.92125 -> -0.921\n        hour21: -0.98225 -> -0.982\n        hour22: -1.02025 -> -1.020\n        hour23: -0.95975 -> -0.960\n\n   Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n        2016-11-06 00:00:00, -0.708\n        2016-11-06 01:00:00, -0.769\n        2016-11-06 02:00:00, -0.777\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for the next days.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any in the input, so we are generating the full 96.\n\n But what if the pattern for Sunday is different? We don't have data to support that. We are using the same pattern for all days.\n\n This is a limitation, but with the data we have, it's the best we can do.\n\n Let's generate the forecast.\n\n We must output in the exact same format as the input, with the same datetime format and the same column names.\n\n The input has:\n\n        date (as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) and LULL (with a space between)\n\n We'll write 96 lines.\n\n Steps for generating the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-06 00:00:00\n   Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2016-11-06 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n   But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        2016-11-06 00:00:00 -0.708\n        2016-11-06 01:00:00 -0.769\n        ... \n\n   We have 24 hours for 4 days.\n\n   We have the 24 values for the hours 0 to 23, and we will repeat them 4 times.\n\n   We'll write the data in the same way as the input: with the date string and the value (with 3 decimal places).\n\n   We must not omit any.\n\n   We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n   We note that the input had a space between the date and the value, and the value is given as a float with 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-11-06 00:00:00 -0.708\n        2016-11-06 01:00:00 -0.769\n        2016-11-06 02:00:00 -0.777\n        2016-11-06 03:00:00 -0.822\n        2016-11-06 04:00:00 -0.815\n        2016-11-06 05:00:00 -0.830\n        2016-11-06 06:00:00 -0.769\n        2016-11-06 07:00:00 -0.738\n        2016-11-06 08:00:00 -0.624\n        2016-11-06 09:00:00 -0.640\n        2016-11-06 10:00:00 -0.525\n        2016-11-06 11:00:00 -0.632\n        2016-11-06 12:00:00 -0.769\n        2016-11-06 13:00:00 -0.761\n        2016-11-06 14:00:00 -0.647\n        2016-11-06 15:00:00 -0.685\n        2016-11-06 16:00:00 -0.686\n        2016-11-06 17:00:00 -0.784\n        2016-11-06 18:00:00 -0.883\n        2016-11-06 19:00:00 -0.906\n        2016-11-06 20:00:00 -0.921\n        2016-11-06 21:00:00 -0.982\n        2016-11-06 22:00:00 -1.020\n        2016-11-06 23:00:00 -0.960\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next day (2016-11-07) and so on.\n\n   We do this for 4 days.\n\n   We must be careful: the last day of the forecast is 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll write 96 lines.\n\n   We note: the input had the date in the format without quotes and the value without any extra spaces.\n\n   We output:\n\n        [date string] [space] [value]\n\n   Example: \"2016-11-06 00:00:00 -0.708\"\n\n   We must not use any extra formatting.\n\n   We'll write the entire block between <answer> and </answer> as specified.\n\n   We note: the input had the column name \"date\" and \"LULL\" in the header, but the forecast output does not require the header? The problem says \"complete data\", meaning the input had a header? But the example given for the input included the header. However, the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and then it listed 96 lines without the header. Then it says \"forecast the data for next 96 recorded dates\". So we output only the 96 lines without header.\n\n   The example output format in the problem does not show a header. So we output 96 lines of:\n\n        YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS value\n\n   with the value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-06\n        Day2: 2016-11-07\n        Day3: 2016-11-08\n        Day4: 2016-11-09\n\n   And for each day, we assign the 24 values we computed.\n\n   We'll write the data.\n\n   Let's do it.\n",
