        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we have consecutive hourly data without gaps. So for the next 96, we must be cautious.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points. Since the data is hourly and shows daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the constraints, we can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality. However, without the ability to run complex models here), we can use a naive seasonal approach:\n\n    Option: \n      - We can take the average of the same hour from the past 4 days (if available) to forecast the next day's same hour.\n\n    But note: we only have 4 days of data: 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st of November 2016.\n\n    However, the data for the 21st has a drop at 04:00 and 05:00? So we must be cautious.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (21st) as the base and adjust by the trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 5. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points, we must not omit any, we will generate 96 forecasts.\n\n 6. Approach: We'll use a seasonal naive forecast by taking the average of the same hour from the past 4 days (if available) for each hour of the day.\n\n    For example, for hour 00:00, we have:\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00: 1.218\n        2016-11-19 00:00:00: 4.173\n        2016-11-20 00:00:00: 1.828\n        2016-11-21 00:00:00: 4.112\n\n    The average for 00:00: (1.218 + 4.173 + 1.828 + 4.112) / 4 = 2.83275\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th) at 00:00, we could use this average? But that would be constant.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (21st) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day to the next? \n\n    However, note that the pattern might be changing. Since we don't have a long history, we can do:\n\n        Forecast for 2016-11-22 00:00:00 = average of the same hour for the last 4 days.\n\n    But then for 2016-11-23 00:00:00, we don't have the 22nd's 00:00 in the history? So we cannot use a rolling average.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the average pattern of the last 4 days and then project that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        a. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average over the 4 days we have.\n        b. Then for the next 4 days (22nd to 25th), for each hour, use the average for that hour.\n\n    But this ignores any trend and will give the same pattern for each day.\n\n    However, looking at the data, the 19th and 21st have higher values at 00:00 than 18th and 20th. So we might see a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 8. Considering the limitations, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days to forecast the same hour for the next 4 days.\n\n    This means we will have 24 average values (for each hour of the day) and we repeat these 24 values for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 9. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 00: (1.218 + 4.173 + 1.828 + 4.112) / 4 = (1.218+4.173=5.391; 5.391+1.828=7.219; 7.219+4.112=11.331) -> 11.331/4 = 2.83275\n    Hour 01: (1.249+3.899+1.462+3.838)/4 = (1.249+3.899=5.148; 5.148+1.462=6.61; 6.61+3.838=10.448) -> 10.448/4 = 2.612\n    Hour 02: (1.097+3.655+1.218+3.716)/4 = (1.097+3.655=4.752; 4.752+1.218=5.97; 5.97+3.716=9.686) -> 9.686/4 = 2.4215\n    Hour 03: (1.066+3.594+1.401+3.716)/4 = (1.066+3.594=4.66; 4.66+1.401=6.061; 6.061+3.716=9.777) -> 9.777/4 = 2.44425\n    Hour 04: (0.975+3.716+1.675+1.371)/4 = (0.975+3.716=4.691; 4.691+1.675=6.366; 6.366+1.371=7.737) -> 7.737/4 = 1.93425\n    Hour 05: (1.401+3.899+1.675+1.492)/4 = (1.401+3.899=5.3; 5.3+1.675=6.975; 6.975+1.492=8.467) -> 8.467/4 = 2.11675\n    Hour 06: (2.071+4.295+1.828+2.071)/4 = (2.071+4.295=6.366; 6.366+1.828=8.194; 8.194+2.071=10.265) -> 10.265/4 = 2.56625\n    Hour 07: (2.650+4.752+2.284+2.711)/4 = (2.650+4.752=7.402; 7.402+2.284=9.686; 9.686+2.711=12.397) -> 12.397/4 = 3.09925\n    Hour 08: (2.315+2.833+2.345+2.589)/4 = (2.315+2.833=5.148; 5.148+2.345=7.493; 7.493+2.589=10.082) -> 10.082/4 = 2.5205\n    Hour 09: (2.132+2.711+2.224+2.528)/4 = (2.132+2.711=4.843; 4.843+2.224=7.067; 7.067+2.528=9.595) -> 9.595/4 = 2.39875\n    Hour 10: (2.863+3.107+2.711+2.345)/4 = (2.863+3.107=5.97; 5.97+2.711=8.681; 8.681+2.345=11.026) -> 11.026/4 = 2.7565\n    Hour 11: (3.076+3.442+3.137+2.711)/4 = (3.076+3.442=6.518; 6.518+3.137=9.655; 9.655+2.711=12.366) -> 12.366/4 = 3.0915\n    Hour 12: (2.102+2.528+2.041+1.919)/4 = (2.102+2.528=4.63; 4.63+2.041=6.671; 6.671+1.919=8.59) -> 8.59/4 = 2.1475\n    Hour 13: (2.132+2.254+2.284+1.858)/4 = (2.132+2.254=4.386; 4.386+2.284=6.67; 6.67+1.858=8.528) -> 8.528/4 = 2.132\n    Hour 14: (1.858+2.498+1.980+2.102)/4 = (1.858+2.498=4.356; 4.356+1.980=6.336; 6.336+2.102=8.438) -> 8.438/4 = 2.1095\n    Hour 15: (1.949+2.315+2.619+1.736)/4 = (1.949+2.315=4.264; 4.264+2.619=6.883; 6.883+1.736=8.619) -> 8.619/4 = 2.15475\n    Hour 16: (1.919+3.076+2.863+2.041)/4 = (1.919+3.076=4.995; 4.995+2.863=7.858; 7.858+2.041=9.899) -> 9.899/4 = 2.47475\n    Hour 17: (2.955+3.594+3.411+2.985)/4 = (2.955+3.594=6.549; 6.549+3.411=9.96; 9.96+2.985=12.945) -> 12.945/4 = 3.23625\n    Hour 18: (2.741+2.711+2.955+2.772)/4 = (2.741+2.711=5.452; 5.452+2.955=8.407; 8.407+2.772=11.179) -> 11.179/4 = 2.79475\n    Hour 19: (2.467+2.437+2.711+2.528)/4 = (2.467+2.437=4.904; 4.904+2.711=7.615; 7.615+2.528=10.143) -> 10.143/4 = 2.53575\n    Hour 20: (2.102+2.163+2.284+2.132)/4 = (2.102+2.163=4.265; 4.265+2.284=6.549; 6.549+2.132=8.681) -> 8.681/4 = 2.17025\n    Hour 21: (1.706+1.797+1.858+1.767)/4 = (1.706+1.797=3.503; 3.503+1.858=5.361; 5.361+1.767=7.128) -> 7.128/4 = 1.782\n    Hour 22: (1.401+1.523+1.675+1.432)/4 = (1.401+1.523=2.924; 2.924+1.675=4.599; 4.599+1.432=6.031) -> 6.031/4 = 1.50775\n    Hour 23: (1.553+1.645+1.614+1.432)/4 = (1.553+1.645=3.198; 3.198+1.614=4.812; 4.812+1.432=6.244) -> 6.244/4 = 1.561\n\n 10. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n     Day 1: 2016-11-22\n        00:00:00 -> 2.83275\n        01:00:00 -> 2.612\n        02:00:00 -> 2.4215\n        03:00:00 -> 2.44425\n        04:00:00 -> 1.93425\n        05:00:00 -> 2.11675\n        06:00:00 -> 2.56625\n        07:00:00 -> 3.09925\n        08:00:00 -> 2.5205\n        09:00:00 -> 2.39875\n        10:00:00 -> 2.7565\n        11:00:00 -> 3.0915\n        12:00:00 -> 2.1475\n        13:00:00 -> 2.132\n        14:00:00 -> 2.1095\n        15:00:00 -> 2.15475\n        16:00:00 -> 2.47475\n        17:00:00 -> 3.23625\n        18:00:00 -> 2.79475\n        19:00:00 -> 2.53575\n        20:00:00 -> 2.17025\n        21:00:00 -> 1.782\n        22:00:00 -> 1.50775\n        23:00:00 -> 1.561\n\n     Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days? But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating without missing values.\n\n     However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided data might have had missing values? But in the given 96 points, we don't see any. So we are generating without missing values.\n\n 11. But note: the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning we should handle missing values in the provided data? But we don't have any in the given 96. So we proceed.\n\n 12. We'll generate 4 days of the same pattern.\n\n 13. Format: We must output the next 96 records in the same format as the input, with the date and the LUFL value.\n\n 14. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Start date: 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n    Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n    We have 24 values for the day, and we'll use the same 24 values for each of the 4 days.\n\n 15. Let's write the data:\n\n    Day 1: 2016-11-22\n        Hour 0: 2.833 (rounded from 2.83275)\n        Hour 1: 2.612\n        Hour 2: 2.422 (rounded from 2.4215)\n        Hour 3: 2.444\n        Hour 4: 1.934\n        Hour 5: 2.117 (rounded from 2.11675)\n        Hour 6: 2.566\n        Hour 7: 3.099\n        Hour 8: 2.520\n        Hour 9: 2.399 (rounded from 2.39875)\n        Hour 10: 2.757 (rounded from 2.7565)\n        Hour 11: 3.092 (rounded from 3.0915)\n        Hour 12: 2.148 (rounded from 2.1475)\n        Hour 13: 2.132\n        Hour 14: 2.110 (rounded from 2.1095)\n        Hour 15: 2.155 (rounded from 2.15475)\n        Hour 16: 2.475\n        Hour 17: 3.236\n        Hour 18: 2.795\n        Hour 19: 2.536\n        Hour 20: 2.170\n        Hour 21: 1.782\n        Hour 22: 1.508 (rounded from 1.50775)\n        Hour 23: 1.561\n\n    Then for the next day (2016-11-23) we use the same 24 numbers.\n\n    And so on for 4 days.\n\n 16.
