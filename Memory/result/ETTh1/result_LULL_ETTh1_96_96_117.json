        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The data starts at 2017-10-12 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-10-16 00:00:00 to 2017-10-19 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the data may have missing values. In the provided data, we have 96 consecutive hours without any missing entries? \n But the instruction says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. The provided data in the example does not show any missing values, but we are to be aware.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact method, we choose an appropriate time series forecasting method.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and likely has daily seasonality (24 hours).\n 2. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, \n    we can use a simple model like seasonal decomposition or exponential smoothing, but note that we have to handle potential missing values.\n\n However, the provided data in the example does not have missing values. But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", meaning in the future? \n Or in the past? The problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then provides 96 points without missing values.\n\n So, for the given past 96 points, we have no missing values. But the problem says to be aware of missing values. \n Since we are only given 96 points and they are complete, we can proceed.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a model that handles seasonality. One common approach for hourly data with daily seasonality is to use a seasonal autoregressive model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n However, with only 4 days of data, it's challenging to capture weekly seasonality (if any) but we only have 4 days so we can only capture daily seasonality.\n\n Let's check the data pattern: \n   The data shows a daily pattern: \n     - Lower values during the night (e.g., around 0.5-0.7)\n     - Higher values during the day (e.g., peaks around 1.0-1.3)\n\n We can use a SARIMA model. But note: we have to choose parameters. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: \n   - Using the average of the same hour from the 4 days we have to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n However, that would be a naive seasonal forecast. But let's see:\n\n   For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we have 4 observations (from the 4 days). We can take the mean (or median) of these 4 to forecast the same hour in the next days.\n\n But note: the problem says the transformer load might have trends? However, we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture a long-term trend.\n\n Steps for the naive seasonal method:\n   - Group the data by hour (i.e., all 00:00, all 01:00, ...)\n   - For each hour, compute the average of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n   - Then, for the next 4 days, for each hour, we use that average.\n\n However, we note that the data might have a stable pattern? But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing for each hour? But that would require more data per hour.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can use the average per hour.\n\n But note: the problem says to be aware of missing values. In the given data, we don't have any, so we can compute the average per hour.\n\n However, if we look at the data, the last day (2017-10-15) has a different pattern? For example, at 00:00: \n   2017-10-12: 0.670\n   2017-10-13: 0.609\n   2017-10-14: 0.853\n   2017-10-15: 0.914\n\n The average for 00:00: (0.670+0.609+0.853+0.914)/4 = 0.7615\n\n Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says the data is \"Low UseLess Load\", which might be a specific type of load? We are not given context.\n\n However, we are to forecast the next 96 hours. We can generate the next 4 days (from 2017-10-16 to 2017-10-19) by repeating the same pattern? \n But using the average per hour.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Extract the hour from the datetime.\n  2. Group by hour and compute the mean of the LULL for that hour over the 4 days.\n  3. Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-10-16 00:00:00 to 2017-10-19 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values in the future? But we are generating the forecast, so we don't have missing values in the forecast? \n The instruction: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\" meaning we must provide 96 values without missing.\n\n But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" - it might be referring to the past? But we are given the past without missing. \n So for the forecast, we are to generate without missing? \n\n Since we are generating the forecast, we will produce 96 values without missing.\n\n However, if we use the average per hour, we are effectively smoothing out the daily variation. But we don't have intra-day variation in the forecast? \n We are using the same value for the same hour in each of the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data we have shows that the same hour in different days has different values. So we are using the average to represent the typical value for that hour.\n\n This is a simple and reasonable approach given the data.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (0.670, 0.609, 0.853, 0.914) -> mean = (0.670+0.609+0.853+0.914)/4 = 3.046/4 = 0.7615\n   hour1: (0.640, 0.548, 0.914, 0.944) -> (0.640+0.548+0.914+0.944)=3.046 -> 0.7615\n   hour2: (0.579, 0.548, 1.036, 0.975) -> (0.579+0.548+1.036+0.975)=3.138 -> 0.7845\n   hour3: (0.609, 0.579, 0.975, 0.883) -> (0.609+0.579+0.975+0.883)=3.046 -> 0.7615\n   hour4: (0.761, 0.701, 0.822, 0.914) -> (0.761+0.701+0.822+0.914)=3.198 -> 0.7995\n   hour5: (0.731, 0.640, 0.975, 0.883) -> (0.731+0.640+0.975+0.883)=3.229 -> 0.80725\n   hour6: (0.701, 0.640, 1.157, 0.975) -> (0.701+0.640+1.157+0.975)=3.473 -> 0.86825\n   hour7: (0.853, 0.701, 1.066, 0.883) -> (0.853+0.701+1.066+0.883)=3.503 -> 0.87575\n   hour8: (0.914, 1.127, 1.188, 1.097) -> (0.914+1.127+1.188+1.097)=4.326 -> 1.0815\n   hour9: (0.944, 1.005, 1.310, 1.066) -> (0.944+1.005+1.310+1.066)=4.325 -> 1.08125\n   hour10: (0.944, 1.127, 1.066, 1.005) -> (0.944+1.127+1.066+1.005)=4.142 -> 1.0355\n   hour11: (0.944, 1.157, 0.975, 0.944) -> (0.944+1.157+0.975+0.944)=4.02 -> 1.005\n   hour12: (0.883, 0.883, 0.853, 0.944) -> (0.883+0.883+0.853+0.944)=3.563 -> 0.89075\n   hour13: (0.914, 0.944, 1.005, 1.066) -> (0.914+0.944+1.005+1.066)=3.929 -> 0.98225\n   hour14: (0.944, 0.853, 0.944, 1.097) -> (0.944+0.853+0.944+1.097)=3.838 -> 0.9595\n   hour15: (0.883, 0.853, 0.914, 0.975) -> (0.883+0.853+0.914+0.975)=3.625 -> 0.90625\n   hour16: (0.822, 0.853, 0.975, 1.066) -> (0.822+0.853+0.975+1.066)=3.716 -> 0.929\n   hour17: (0.853, 0.670, 0.944, 0.975) -> (0.853+0.670+0.944+0.975)=3.442 -> 0.8605\n   hour18: (0.853, 0.701, 0.822, 0.883) -> (0.853+0.701+0.822+0.883)=3.259 -> 0.81475\n   hour19: (0.853, 0.670, 0.792, 1.036) -> (0.853+0.670+0.792+1.036)=3.351 -> 0.83775\n   hour20: (0.822, 0.822, 1.036, 1.097) -> (0.822+0.822+1.036+1.097)=3.777 -> 0.94425\n   hour21: (0.761, 0.822, 1.005, 1.005) -> (0.761+0.822+1.005+1.005)=3.593 -> 0.89825\n   hour22: (0.792, 0.701, 0.792, 1.036) -> (0.792+0.701+0.792+1.036)=3.321 -> 0.83025\n   hour23: (0.731, 0.883, 0.975, 0.761) -> (0.731+0.883+0.975+0.761)=3.35 -> 0.8375\n\n But wait, let me double-check the data:\n\n   For hour0: \n        2017-10-12 00:00:00 -> 0.670\n        2017-10-13 00:00:00 -> 0.609\n        2017-10-14 00:00:00 -> 0.853\n        2017-10-15 00:00:00 -> 0.914\n        Sum = 0.670+0.609+0.853+0.914 = 3.046 -> 0.7615\n\n   Similarly, for hour1:\n        2017-10-12 01:00:00 -> 0.640\n        2017-10-13 01:00:00 -> 0.548\n        2017-10-14 01:00:00 -> 0.914\n        2017-10-15 01:00:00 -> 0.944\n        Sum = 0.640+0.548+0.914+0.944 = 3.046 -> 0.7615\n\n   So the averages are as above.\n\n Now, we generate the next 4 days (96 hours) from 2017-10-16 00:00:00 to 2017-10-19 23:00:00.\n\n   Day 1: 2017-10-16\n        00:00:00 -> 0.7615\n        01:00:00 -> 0.7615\n        02:00:00 -> 0.7845\n        03:00:00 -> 0.7615\n        ... and so on for each hour.\n\n   Day 2: 2017-10-17: same as the averages per hour.\n   Day 3: 2017-10-18: same.\n   Day 4: 2017-10-19: same.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data is from a transformer and might have trends? But we don't have enough data to capture a trend. \n Also, the average method is a safe baseline.\n\n But let me check: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and the values are between 0.5 and 1.3. The average per hour is a reasonable forecast.\n\n However, we must note that the average method does not capture any potential change in pattern. But with only 4 days, we cannot do much.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a more sophisticated model, but we are constrained by the data size.\n\n Considering the above, we will use the average per hour for the next 96 hours.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we will output 96 lines.\n\n Format: \n        date  LULL\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00 [value]\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00 [value]\n        ...\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-10-16 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 2017-10-19 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n\n We have the averages for each hour (0 to 23) as computed above.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 average values (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat that list 4 times.\n\n   The 24 averages (in order from hour0 to hour23) are:\n\n        [0.7615, 0.7615, 0.7845, 0.7615, 0.7995, 0.80725, 0.86825, 0.87575, 1.0815, 1.08125, 1.0355, 1.005, 0.89075, 0.98225, 0.9595, 0.90625, 0.929, 0.8605, 0.81475, 0.83775, 0.94425, 0.89825, 0.83025, 0.8375]\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n However, note: the last day in the provided data is 2017-10-15. The next day is 2017-10-16.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-10-16, hours 0 to 23\n   Day 2: 2017-10-17, hours 0 to 23\n   Day 3: 2017-10-18, hours 0 to 23\n   Day 4: 2017-10-19, hours 0 to 23\n\n We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the provided data is hourly. \n The problem says: \"It is subdivided into four mini-datasets, with data sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes.\" \n And the given data is hourly (24 points per day). So we are to forecast hourly.\n\n Therefore, we output hourly.\n\n However, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n But we are generating the forecast and we are generating a complete set. So we are not introducing missing values.\n\n We'll output the forecast as described.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\" and the values we are outputting are averages. We must round to 3 decimal places? \n The input data has 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n   hour0: 0.7615 -> 0.762 (rounding to 3 decimals: 0.762)\n   hour1: 0.7615 -> 0.762\n   hour2: 0.7845 -> 0.784\n   hour3: 0.7615 -> 0.762\n   hour4: 0.7995 -> 0.800\n   hour5: 0.80725 -> 0.807\n   hour6: 0.86825 -> 0.868\n   hour7: 0.87575 -> 0.876\n   hour8: 1.0815 -> 1.082\n   hour9: 1.08125 -> 1.081\n   hour10: 1.0355 -> 1.036\n   hour11: 1.005 -> 1.005\n   hour12: 0.89075 -> 0.891\n   hour13: 0.98225 -> 0.982\n   hour14: 0.9595 -> 0.960\n   hour15: 0.90625 -> 0.906\n   hour16: 0.929 -> 0.929\n   hour17: 0.8605 -> 0.861\n   hour18: 0.81475 -> 0.815\n   hour19: 0.83775 -> 0.838\n   hour20: 0.94425 -> 0.944\n   hour21: 0.89825 -> 0.898\n   hour22: 0.83025 -> 0.830\n   hour23: 0.8375 -> 0.838\n\n So the list of 24 values (rounded) for one day:\n\n   [0.762, 0.762, 0.784, 0.762, 0.800, 0.807, 0.868, 0.876, 1.082, 1.081, 1.036, 1.005, 0.891, 0.982, 0.960, 0.906, 0.929, 0.861, 0.815, 0.838, 0.944, 0.898, 0.830, 0.838]\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2017-10-16 00:00:00 -> 0.762\n          2017-10-16 01:00:00 -> 0.762\n          ... until 2017-10-16 23:00:00 -> 0.838\n\n   Then 2017-10-17 00:00:00 -> 0.762\n        ... and so on.\n\n We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n Format of the answer:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date1] [value1]\n        [date2] [value2]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n We must output 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the generation:\n\n   dates = []\n   start_date = \"2017-10-16 00:00:00\"\n   We'll generate 96 hours.\n\n   We can use pandas to generate the date range? But we are not using pandas in the answer, we just output.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        for day in range(4):   # 4 days\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-10-{16+day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                # But note: the day might go beyond 19? 16,17,18,19 -> 4 days.\n\n        However, we must format the day: 16,17,18,19 -> so we can do:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017,10,16)\n        then add timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)\n\n   But to keep it simple, we can do:\n\n        days = [16,17,18,19]\n        for day in days:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = f\"2017-10-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n   But note: the day 16,17,18,19: we must format with two digits? day is two digits.\n\n   Alternatively, we can generate:\n\n        start = \"2017-10-16 00:00:00\"\n        then for i in range(96):\n            date = start + i hours\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        base = datetime(2017,10,16,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format as string: \"2017-10-16 00:00:00\"\n\n   But we are not allowed to use code in the final answer? We have to output the data.\n\n   We'll generate the list of dates and then assign the values.\n\n   The values: we have a list of 24 values for one day, and we repeat it 4 times.\n\n   So:\n\n        values = [0.762, 0.762, 0.784, 0.762, 0.800, 0.807, 0.868, 0.876, 1.082, 1.081, 1.036, 1.005, 0.891, 0.982, 0.960, 0.906, 0.929, 0.861, 0.815, 0.838, 0.944, 0.898, 0.830, 0.838]\n        forecast_values = values * 4   # this will repeat the list 4 times.\n\n   Then we have 96 values.\n\n   Now, we output:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            date_str = (base + timedelta(hours=i)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            value = forecast_values[i]\n            print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")   # but we have the value already rounded? we stored rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n   But note: we stored the rounded values, so we can output as is.\n\n However, to be safe, we can format the value to 3 decimal places.\n\n But the values we stored are floats with 3 decimal representation? Actually, we rounded to 3 decimals, but when printing we can format.\n\n Alternatively, we can output the string with 3 decimals.\n\n Since the problem requires the same format as the input (which has 3 decimals), we output with 3 decimals.\n\n But note: the input had 3 decimal places, but sometimes 2 or 3? For example, 0.670, 0.640, etc.\n\n We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n However, we computed the averages and rounded to 3 decimals. So we can output the rounded numbers.\n\n But note: the rounding we did was to 3 decimal places? Yes, we rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n Example: 0.7615 -> 0.762, 0.7615 -> 0.762, 0.7845 -> 0.784, etc.\n\n We'll output the forecast.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\" and we are forecasting for the same.\n\n We are ready.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only given LULL (Low UseLess Load). \n We are only forcasting LULL.\n\n We output only the LULL.\n\n Format of each line: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS value\"\n\n We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n Important: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\".\n\n We'll output 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", meaning the next 96 dates and the forecasted LULL.\n\n We do as described.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but we are generating without missing. \n We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n We are done.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n   We'll create a list of dates and values.\n\n   Dates: \n        2017-10-16 00:00:00 -> 0.762\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00 -> 0.762\n        2017-10-16 02:00:00 -> 0.784\n        2017-10-16 03:00:00 -> 0.762\n        2017-10-16 04:00:00 -> 0.800\n        2017-10-16 05:00:00 -> 0.807\n        2017-10-16 06:00:00 -> 0.868\n        2017-10-16 07:00:00 -> 0.876\n        2017-10-16 08:00:00 -> 1.082\n        2017-10-16 09:00:00 -> 1.081\n        2017-10-16 10:00:00 -> 1.036\n        2017-10-16 11:00:00 -> 1.005\n        2017-10-16 12:00:00 -> 0.891\n        2017-10-16 13:00:00 -> 0.982\n        2017-10-16 14:00:00 -> 0.960\n        2017-10-16 15:00:00 -> 0.906\n        2017-10-16 16:00:00 -> 0.929\n        2017-10-16 17:00:00 -> 0.861\n        2017-10-16 18:00:00 -> 0.815\n        2017-10-16 19:00:00 -> 0.838\n        2017-10-16 20:00:00 -> 0.944\n        2017-10-16 21:00:00 -> 0.898\n        2017-10-16 22:00:00 -> 0.830\n        2017-10-16 23:00:00 -> 0.838\n\n   Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n We'll write the answer accordingly.\n\n But note: the day 17,18,19: the format for day 17: 2017-10-17, etc.\n\n We'll generate the dates correctly.\n\n We are ready to output.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data for the past 96 recorded dates, and we are forecasting the next 96.\n\n We output the next 96.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required format.\n",
