        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates does not have missing values in the given sample).\n 2. We must generate 96 future data points.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps. Given the data, we observe:\n   - The data shows daily seasonality (24 hours) and also some intra-day patterns (e.g., peaks at night and lower during the day?).\n   - We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history for a seasonal model with 24-hour seasonality.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can try:\n   - Using a simple seasonal naive model: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day? But we have only 4 days, so we can use the average of the same hour over the available days? \n   - Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet or ETS, but we are limited by the data length.\n\n Given the instruction to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, and without the ability to run code, we must rely on a simple method.\n\n Proposed method:\n We observe that the data has a pattern that repeats every 24 hours. We can compute the average of each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 available days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (since 96 hours = 4 days).\n\n Steps for calculation:\n   - Group the data by hour of the day (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00). We have 4 values for each hour (from 4 days).\n   - For each hour, compute the average of the 4 values. This average will be the forecast for that hour in the next days.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's look at the last day (2016-11-05) and compare to the previous days? \n   - The values on 2016-11-05 seem a bit lower than the first day? But without more data, we assume that the pattern is stable.\n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values. In the provided data, we don't have missing values, so we can proceed.\n\n Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n  00:00: [6.112, 12.402, 10.589, 8.422] -> (6.112+12.402+10.589+8.422)/4 = 9.38125\n  01:00: [4.904, 11.265, 9.452, 8.493] -> (4.904+11.265+9.452+8.493)/4 = 8.5285\n  02:00: [5.082, 12.189, 10.732, 9.168] -> (5.082+12.189+10.732+9.168)/4 = 9.29275\n  03:00: [5.188, 11.904, 10.554, 9.346] -> (5.188+11.904+10.554+9.346)/4 = 9.248\n  04:00: [4.833, 11.869, 10.270, 8.209] -> (4.833+11.869+10.270+8.209)/4 = 8.79525\n  05:00: [5.757, 10.376, 9.523, 8.422] -> (5.757+10.376+9.523+8.422)/4 = 8.5195\n  06:00: [5.615, 12.224, 8.706, 8.422] -> (5.615+12.224+8.706+8.422)/4 = 8.74175\n  07:00: [5.757, 11.442, 11.158, 10.838] -> (5.757+11.442+11.158+10.838)/4 = 9.79875\n  08:00: [5.472, 7.889, 7.747, 5.899] -> (5.472+7.889+7.747+5.899)/4 = 6.75175\n  09:00: [5.863, 5.046, 8.138, 4.548] -> (5.863+5.046+8.138+4.548)/4 = 5.89875\n  10:00: [5.650, 5.508, 5.579, 5.046] -> (5.650+5.508+5.579+5.046)/4 = 5.44575\n  11:00: [5.934, 5.401, 5.650, 5.401] -> (5.934+5.401+5.650+5.401)/4 = 5.5965\n  12:00: [3.660, 3.553, 3.411, 3.873] -> (3.660+3.553+3.411+3.873)/4 = 3.62425\n  13:00: [4.371, 3.980, 3.980, 4.655] -> (4.371+3.980+3.980+4.655)/4 = 4.2465\n  14:00: [4.335, 4.051, 4.335, 4.620] -> (4.335+4.051+4.335+4.620)/4 = 4.33525\n  15:00: [4.051, 3.909, 4.193, 4.371] -> (4.051+3.909+4.193+4.371)/4 = 4.131\n  16:00: [4.406, 4.477, 4.513, 4.300] -> (4.406+4.477+4.513+4.300)/4 = 4.424\n  17:00: [5.188, 5.082, 5.224, 4.868] -> (5.188+5.082+5.224+4.868)/4 = 5.0905\n  18:00: [4.584, 4.939, 4.584, 4.868] -> (4.584+4.939+4.584+4.868)/4 = 4.74375\n  19:00: [4.442, 4.691, 4.513, 4.442] -> (4.442+4.691+4.513+4.442)/4 = 4.522\n  20:00: [4.015, 4.087, 4.015, 4.015] -> (4.015+4.087+4.015+4.015)/4 = 4.033\n  21:00: [5.757, 4.087, 3.447, 4.442] -> (5.757+4.087+3.447+4.442)/4 = 4.43325\n  22:00: [8.848, 6.681, 5.437, 6.858] -> (8.848+6.681+5.437+6.858)/4 = 6.956\n  23:00: [10.056, 9.701, 7.285, 8.102] -> (10.056+9.701+7.285+8.102)/4 = 8.786\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-11-06 to 2016-11-09) will be:\n   Day 1 (2016-11-06): [00:00: 9.38125, 01:00: 8.5285, ... , 23:00: 8.786]\n   Day 2 (2016-11-07): same as Day 1\n   Day 3 (2016-11-08): same as Day 1\n   Day 4 (2016-11-09): same as Day 1\n\n But note: the last provided date is 2016-11-05 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours start at 2016-11-06 00:00:00 and end at 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might not be exactly the same every day? But with only 4 days, we don't have a strong trend or weekly pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a model that accounts for the last known value and the seasonality. But the simple average per hour is a straightforward approach.\n\n Let's generate the forecast:\n\n   We'll create 4 identical days (each day having the 24 averages we calculated) for the next 4 days.\n\n Format: We must output the date and time from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00, and the forecasted MUFL value.\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Example for the first day (2016-11-06):\n   2016-11-06 00:00:00  9.381\n   2016-11-06 01:00:00  8.529   (rounded from 8.5285 -> 8.529? But note: 8.5285 rounded to 3 decimals is 8.529 because 8.5285 is exactly halfway? Actually, 8.5285: rounding to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal (5) -> round up the 3rd decimal from 8 to 9 -> 8.529)\n\n However, let's check the input: they have 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the input has values like 4.904, 5.082, etc. So we'll do the same.\n\n We'll round each average to 3 decimal places using standard rounding.\n\n Let's recalculate the rounded values:\n\n   00:00: 9.38125 -> 9.381\n   01:00: 8.5285  -> 8.529 (because 8.5285: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round the third decimal (8) up to 9 -> 8.529)\n   02:00: 9.29275 -> 9.293\n   03:00: 9.248   -> 9.248\n   04:00: 8.79525 -> 8.795\n   05:00: 8.5195  -> 8.520\n   06:00: 8.74175 -> 8.742\n   07:00: 9.79875 -> 9.799\n   08:00: 6.75175 -> 6.752\n   09:00: 5.89875 -> 5.899\n   10:00: 5.44575 -> 5.446\n   11:00: 5.5965  -> 5.597\n   12:00: 3.62425 -> 3.624\n   13:00: 4.2465  -> 4.247\n   14:00: 4.33525 -> 4.335\n   15:00: 4.131   -> 4.131\n   16:00: 4.424   -> 4.424\n   17:00: 5.0905  -> 5.091\n   18:00: 4.74375 -> 4.744\n   19:00: 4.522   -> 4.522\n   20:00: 4.033   -> 4.033\n   21:00: 4.43325 -> 4.433\n   22:00: 6.956   -> 6.956\n   23:00: 8.786   -> 8.786\n\n But wait, 4.43325 rounded to 3 decimals: \n   The third decimal is 3, the fourth is 2 -> so 4.433? \n   Actually, 4.43325: \n        The digit in the third decimal place is 3, the next digit is 2 which is less than 5, so we leave it as 4.433.\n\n Let me recast the rounding for each:\n\n   00:00: 9.38125 -> 9.381\n   01:00: 8.5285  -> 8.529 (because 8.5285: the fourth digit is 5, so we round up the third digit: 8 -> 9)\n   02:00: 9.29275 -> 9.293\n   03:00: 9.24800 -> 9.248\n   04:00: 8.79525 -> 8.795\n   05:00: 8.5195  -> 8.520\n   06:00: 8.74175 -> 8.742\n   07:00: 9.79875 -> 9.799\n   08:00: 6.75175 -> 6.752\n   09:00: 5.89875 -> 5.899\n   10:00: 5.44575 -> 5.446\n   11:00: 5.5965  -> 5.597\n   12:00: 3.62425 -> 3.624\n   13:00: 4.2465  -> 4.247\n   14:00: 4.33525 -> 4.335 (because 4.33525: the fourth digit is 2, so we leave the third decimal as 5 -> 4.335)\n   15:00: 4.13100 -> 4.131\n   16:00: 4.42400 -> 4.424\n   17:00: 5.0905  -> 5.091\n   18:00: 4.74375 -> 4.744\n   19:00: 4.52200 -> 4.522\n   20:00: 4.03300 -> 4.033\n   21:00: 4.43325 -> 4.433\n   22:00: 6.95600 -> 6.956\n   23:00: 8.78600 -> 8.786\n\n Now, we create 4 days of these 24 values.\n\n The next 96 hours:\n\n   Day 1: 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-06 23:00:00\n   Day 2: 2016-11-07 00:00:00 to 2016-11-07 23:00:00\n   Day 3: 2016-11-08 00:00:00 to 2016-11-08 23:00:00\n   Day 4: 2016-11-09 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n Let's write the data:\n\n  2016-11-06 00:00:00  9.381\n  2016-11-06 01:00:00  8.529\n  2016-11-06 02:00:00  9.293\n  2016-11-06 03:00:00  9.248\n  2016-11-06 04:00:00  8.795\n  2016-11-06 05:00:00  8.520\n  2016-11-06 06:00:00  8.742\n  2016-11-06 07:00:00  9.799\n  2016-11-06 08:00:00  6.752\n  2016-11-06 09:00:00  5.899\n  2016-11-06 10:00:00  5.446\n  2016-11-06 11:00:00  5.597\n  2016-11-06 12:00:00  3.624\n  2016-11-06 13:00:00  4.247\n  2016-11-06 14:00:00  4.335\n  2016-11-06 15:00:00  4.131\n  2016-11-06 16:00:00  4.424\n  2016-11-06 17:00:00  5.091\n  2016-11-06 18:00:00  4.744\n  2016-11-06 19:00:00  4.522\n  2016-11-06 20:00:00  4.033\n  2016-11-06 21:00:00  4.433\n  2016-11-06 22:00:00  6.956\n  2016-11-06 23:00:00  8.786\n\n Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next three days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are forecasting without missing values? \n   We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n However, if we had missing values in the input, we would have to impute them. But the provided input does not have missing values.\n\n We are providing the forecast for the next 96 hours.\n\n Let's write the entire 96 lines.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-06 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-06 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n\n We'll use the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n We must be cautious: the rounding we did might have slight variations?
