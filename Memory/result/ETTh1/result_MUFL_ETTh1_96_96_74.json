        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) as seen by the repeated pattern of values.\n 2. There are missing values in the provided data? The user says the data will have missing values, but the provided 96 points seem complete? \n    However, we are to be aware of missing values. Since the provided data for the past 96 is complete, we assume the missing values might be in the future? \n    But the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided past data might have missing values? \n    However, looking at the provided data, we have 96 consecutive hourly points without any gap. So we proceed with the provided data as complete.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data and daily seasonality (period=24), \n    we can use a seasonal model. One common approach is to use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model.\n\n 4. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - Check stationarity: We might need to difference the data to make it stationary (if it isn't). \n    - We note that the data has a daily pattern and also a trend within each day? But overall, the level of the series seems consistent.\n\n 5. However, note that the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short time series for training a SARIMA model with multiple seasonal parameters.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, or a seasonal naive method.\n\n 7. Given the very limited data, we might consider:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day. Since we have 4 days, we can take the last day (2017-04-26) and use it as the forecast for the next day? \n      But then we have 4 days, so we can also average the same hour over the 4 days? However, the pattern might change.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the available days. But note: we have only 4 days.\n\n 9. Another idea: use an average daily profile and then adjust by the level of the last day? \n\n 10. However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a robust method. But with only 4 days, complex models might overfit.\n\n 11. We decide to use a simple average of the same hour from the four available days to form the daily profile. Then we use that profile for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n    Steps for the simple average:\n        - Extract the hour-of-day for each record.\n        - Group by hour and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 12. Why this approach?\n     - The data shows a clear daily pattern. \n     - We don't have a long-term trend in 4 days? Actually, the level of the series might be slightly different each day? \n        But without more data, we assume the daily pattern is stable.\n\n 13. However, note that the last day (2017-04-26) has some values that are different (like at 10:00, 11:00, etc.). \n     But we are going to average over the average of the same hour for the 4 days.\n\n 14. How to handle the starting point? The next hour after 2017-04-26 23:00:00 is 2017-04-27 00:00:00.\n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00): (8.706 + 7.000 + 8.813 + 8.706) / 4 = (8.706+7+8.813+8.706)/4 = 33.225/4 = 8.30625\n     Hour 1 (01:00): (9.381 + 8.138 + 7.071 + 8.209) / 4 = (9.381+8.138+7.071+8.209)/4 = 32.799/4 = 8.19975\n     ... and so on.\n\n 16. Then we repeat this daily profile for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 17. But note: the user said the data has missing values? We are not seeing missing values in the provided past data. \n     So for the past data we have, we can compute the average without missing values. \n\n 18. However, if in the provided past data there were missing values, we would have to impute. But the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 19. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps and assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 20. Steps to generate the next 96 timestamps:\n        Start: 2017-04-27 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-04-26 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-04-27 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-30 23:00:00 (which is 4 days = 96 hours).\n\n 21. We compute the average for each of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n 22. Let's do the computation:\n\n     We have 4 days: 2017-04-23, 2017-04-24, 2017-04-25, 2017-04-26.\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values.\n\n 23. Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 8.706\n        Day2: 7.000\n        Day3: 8.813\n        Day4: 8.706\n        Average = (8.706 + 7.000 + 8.813 + 8.706) / 4 = 8.30625\n\n 24. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 25. Then for the next 4 days (2017-04-27 to 2017-04-30), we assign:\n        Day1 (2017-04-27): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... avg_hour23]\n        Day2 (2017-04-28): [avg_hour0, ...]\n        Day3 (2017-04-29): [avg_hour0, ...]\n        Day4 (2017-04-30): [avg_hour0, ...]\n\n 26. This gives 96 points.\n\n 27. However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all in the same week? Thursday to Sunday? \n     Actually, 2017-04-23 is Sunday, 2017-04-24 Monday, 2017-04-25 Tuesday, 2017-04-26 Wednesday. \n     The next 4 days would be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. \n     But we don't have data for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday in the past? So we cannot account for weekly seasonality with only 4 days.\n\n 28. Therefore, we stick to the daily average.\n\n 29. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create an array `avg_per_hour` of length 24.\n\n     Hour 0: (8.706 + 7.000 + 8.813 + 8.706) / 4 = 8.30625\n     Hour 1: (9.381 + 8.138 + 7.071 + 8.209) / 4 = (9.381+8.138+7.071+8.209)=32.799 -> 8.19975\n     Hour 2: (9.239 + 7.107 + 8.599 + 8.209) / 4 = (9.239+7.107+8.599+8.209)=33.154 -> 8.2885\n     Hour 3: (9.026 + 6.290 + 6.787 + 8.173) / 4 = (9.026+6.290+6.787+8.173)=30.276 -> 7.569\n     Hour 4: (9.061 + 6.787 + 6.396 + 7.782) / 4 = (9.061+6.787+6.396+7.782)=30.026 -> 7.5065\n     Hour 5: (8.848 + 6.538 + 8.066 + 9.452) / 4 = (8.848+6.538+8.066+9.452)=32.904 -> 8.226\n     Hour 6: (8.493 + 7.391 + 8.422 + 10.234) / 4 = (8.493+7.391+8.422+10.234)=34.54 -> 8.635\n     Hour 7: (4.584 + 1.848 + 4.904 + 7.178) / 4 = (4.584+1.848+4.904+7.178)=18.514 -> 4.6285\n     Hour 8: (-2.559 + -5.934 + -1.564 + 6.716) / 4 = (-2.559-5.934-1.564+6.716)= -3.341 -> -0.83525\n     Hour 9: (-11.265 + -11.229 + -0.959 + -0.249) / 4 = (-11.265-11.229-0.959-0.249)= -23.702 -> -5.9255\n     Hour 10: (-15.173 + -14.214 + -1.990 + 1.706) / 4 = (-15.173-14.214-1.990+1.706)= -29.671 -> -7.41775\n     Hour 11: (-17.270 + -16.773 + 0.995 + -3.802) / 4 = (-17.270-16.773+0.995-3.802)= -36.85 -> -9.2125\n     Hour 12: (-19.153 + -18.691 + -4.051 + -7.498) / 4 = (-19.153-18.691-4.051-7.498)= -49.393 -> -12.34825\n     Hour 13: (-18.514 + -17.945 + -4.122 + -9.523) / 4 = (-18.514-17.945-4.122-9.523)= -50.104 -> -12.526\n     Hour 14: (-16.168 + -15.422 + 0.320 + -0.746) / 4 = (-16.168-15.422+0.320-0.746)= -32.016 -> -8.004\n     Hour 15: (-12.828 + -11.051 + 0.107 + -0.284) / 4 = (-12.828-11.051+0.107-0.284)= -24.056 -> -6.014\n     Hour 16: (-7.391 + -3.873 + 3.482 + 0.675) / 4 = (-7.391-3.873+3.482+0.675)= -7.107 -> -1.77675\n     Hour 17: (1.599 + -0.533 + 4.335 + 7.143) / 4 = (1.599-0.533+4.335+7.143)=12.544 -> 3.136\n     Hour 18: (2.701 + 2.949 + 3.873 + 4.335) / 4 = (2.701+2.949+3.873+4.335)=13.858 -> 3.4645\n     Hour 19: (3.802 + 3.980 + 4.087 + 4.264) / 4 = (3.802+3.980+4.087+4.264)=16.133 -> 4.03325\n     Hour 20: (4.051 + 4.442 + 3.660 + 4.548) / 4 = (4.051+4.442+3.660+4.548)=16.701 -> 4.17525\n     Hour 21: (3.767 + 4.335 + 4.975 + 3.731) / 4 = (3.767+4.335+4.975+3.731)=16.808 -> 4.202\n     Hour 22: (3.305 + 4.513 + 5.366 + 3.802) / 4 = (3.305+4.513+5.366+3.802)=16.986 -> 4.2465\n     Hour 23: (7.000 + 6.254 + 7.604 + 6.254) / 4 = (7.000+6.254+7.604+6.254)=27.112 -> 6.778\n\n 30. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-04-27\n        00:00:00 -> 8.30625\n        01:00:00 -> 8.19975\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 6.778\n\n     Day 2: 2017-04-28: same 24 values\n     Day 3: 2017-04-29: same\n     Day 4: 2017-04-30: same\n\n 31. We output the data in the same format as the input, with the date and the MUFL value.\n\n 32. Format the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 33. However, note: the input had some values with 3 decimal places and some with 6? Actually, they are all to 3 decimal places? \n     The example: \n        8.706000 -> 8.706\n        9.381000 -> 9.381\n\n     So we output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. We'll round the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 35. Let's recompute the averages and round:\n\n     Hour 0: 8.30625 -> 8.306\n     Hour 1: 8.19975 -> 8.200\n     Hour 2: 8.2885 -> 8.289\n     Hour 3: 7.569 -> 7.569\n     Hour 4: 7.5065 -> 7.507\n     Hour 5: 8.226 -> 8.226\n     Hour 6: 8.635 -> 8.635\n     Hour 7: 4.6285 -> 4.629\n     Hour 8: -0.83525 -> -0.835\n     Hour 9: -5.9255 -> -5.926\n     Hour 10: -7.41775 -> -7.418\n     Hour 11: -9.2125 -> -9.212\n     Hour 12: -12.34825 -> -12.348\n     Hour 13: -12.526 -> -12.526\n     Hour 14: -8.004 -> -8.004\n     Hour 15: -6.014 -> -6.014\n     Hour 16: -1.77675 -> -1.777\n     Hour 17: 3.136 -> 3.136\n     Hour 18: 3.4645 -> 3.465\n     Hour 19: 4.03325 -> 4.033\n     Hour 20: 4.17525 -> 4.175\n     Hour 21: 4.202 -> 4.202\n     Hour 22: 4.2465 -> 4.247\n     Hour 23: 6.778 -> 6.778\n\n 36. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-04-27 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-04-27 01:00:00, ... until 2017-04-27 23:00:00\n     Then 2017-04-28 00:00:00 ... until 2017-04-28 23:00:00\n     Then 2017-04-29 00:00:00 ... until 2017-04-29 23:00:00\n     Then 2017-04-30 00:00:00 ... until 2017-04-30 23:00:00\n\n 37. We output in the same format: \n        date (as string in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS') and the MUFL value.\n\n 38. We output 96 lines.\n\n 39. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 40. Note: The user said \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 41. We output the data in the following structure:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.306\n2017-04-27 01:00:00   8.200\n... (all 96 lines)\n2017-04-30 23:00:00   6.778\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 42. Let's write the code to generate the dates and the corresponding average value for the hour.\n\n 43. We'll create a list of the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimals) for the hours 0: 8.306\n1: 8.200\n2: 8.289\n3: 7.569\n4: 7.507\n5: 8.226\n6: 8.635\n7: 4.629\n8: -0.835\n9: -5.926\n10: -7.418\n11: -9.212\n12: -12.348\n13: -12.526\n14: -8.004\n15: -6.014\n16: -1.777\n17: 3.136\n18: 3.465\n19: 4.033\n20: 4.175\n21: 4.202\n22: 4.247\n23: 6.778\n\n 44. Then for each day in the next 4 days (from 2017-04-27 to 2017-04-30) and for each hour in 0..23, we output:\n\n        date_str = f\"{date} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n        value = avg_per_hour[hour]\n\n 45. We use the following for the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-27\n        Day2: 2017-04-28\n        Day3: 2017-04-29\n        Day4: 2017-04-30\n\n 46. We generate the data.\n\n 47. We write the output in the exact format.\n\n 48. Note: The input had the date as index without the index column. So we output:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.306\"\n\n     But note the example input had the date as a string and then the float. We output the same.\n\n 49. We output the data as:\n\n        [date string]   [value]\n\n     and the value is formatted to 3 decimal places.\n\n 50. We do not use any index numbers.\n\n 51. We write the 96 lines.\n\n 52. Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: we are not actually coding but writing the output. We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n 53. We'll write the output in the required markdown code block.\n\n 54. We note that the next 96 dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-27 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-04-30 23:00:00\n\n 55. We generate:\n\n        for day in [27, 28, 29, 30]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = \"2017-04-{:02d} {:02d}:00:00\".format(day, hour)\n                value = avg_per_hour[hour]\n\n 56. But note: April has 30 days, so 27,28,29,30 are valid.\n\n 57.
