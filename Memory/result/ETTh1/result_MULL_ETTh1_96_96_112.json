        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. \n    However, the provided sample does not show any missing value. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days, we can expect daily seasonality.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality. But note that the data is hourly and we have 24 points per day, so seasonality of 24.\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data might have non-constant variance or trend? Let's observe the provided data:\n\n    The values are negative and seem to fluctuate without a clear trend. There is a daily pattern: \n        - The values become more negative during the day (especially in the afternoon and evening) and less negative at night and early morning.\n\n 6. We will use a seasonal model. Since we have 96 points (4 days) and we want to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 7. We choose to use SARIMA. We need to select parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). \n\n 8. Due to the limited data, we might use a simple model. We can try:\n\n    - First, check stationarity. The data does not show a strong trend, so we might set d=0 or 1? \n    - We can use auto_arima to select the best parameters? But we are not run code, so we have to reason.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But that would be naive.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will use a seasonal naive method: \n        y_{t+24} = y_t   for t in the last day? But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n     However, we are to forecast 96 points, which is 4 days. We can do:\n\n        For the first 24 hours of forecast (2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-26 23:00:00):\n            Use the average of the same hour from the previous 4 days (2017-09-22, 2017-09-23, 2017-09-24, 2017-09-25) at that hour.\n\n        Similarly for the next days? But we don't have future data to average. So we can only use the same hour from the past days.\n\n     However, note that we are forecasting 4 days, and we have exactly 4 days of history. So we can use:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the forecast period (day 5 to day 8, i.e., 4 days), we set:\n\n        Forecast for day 5, hour h = average of day1_h, day2_h, day3_h, day4_h\n        Similarly, for day 6, hour h = same as above? But that would be the same as day5. \n\n     Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days for each of the 4 days? But that would be constant per hour across the forecast days.\n\n     We want to capture the pattern but we don't have a trend. So we can use the same pattern for each day? \n\n     Since we don't have a long-term trend, we can assume the pattern repeats every day. Then we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n     Example for hour 0: \n        day1: 2017-09-22 00:00:00 -> -0.142\n        day2: 2017-09-23 00:00:00 -> -0.107\n        day3: 2017-09-24 00:00:00 -> -0.213\n        day4: 2017-09-25 00:00:00 -> -0.320\n\n        average = (-0.142 -0.107 -0.213 -0.320)/4 = -0.1955\n\n        Then for each of the next 4 days at 00:00:00, we use -0.1955.\n\n     Similarly for each hour.\n\n 11. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality. It is robust to small data.\n\n 12. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points there are none. So we don't have to handle missing values in the input.\n\n 13. We will generate 96 data points: from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n 14. Steps for generating the forecast:\n\n      a. Group the historical data by hour (0 to 23). We have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n      b. For each hour, compute the average of the 4 values.\n      c. Then for the next 4 days, for each hour in the day, assign the average value for that hour.\n\n 15. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [ -0.142, -0.107, -0.213, -0.320 ] -> average = (-0.142-0.107-0.213-0.320)/4 = -0.780/4 = -0.195\n        hour1: [ -1.635, -0.036, -0.746, -1.315 ] -> (-1.635-0.036-0.746-1.315) = -3.732/4 = -0.933\n        hour2: [ -0.249, -1.173, -0.320, -0.782 ] -> (-0.249-1.173-0.320-0.782) = -2.524/4 = -0.631\n        hour3: [ 0.036, -0.533, -0.995, 0.284 ] -> (0.036-0.533-0.995+0.284) = -1.208/4 = -0.302\n        hour4: [ 0.746, -0.249, 0.107, -0.569 ] -> (0.746-0.249+0.107-0.569) = 0.035/4 = 0.00875 -> 0.009\n        hour5: [ -0.711, -0.604, 0.000, -0.853 ] -> (-0.711-0.604+0.000-0.853) = -2.168/4 = -0.542\n        hour6: [ -0.249, -0.995, -1.528, -1.599 ] -> (-0.249-0.995-1.528-1.599) = -4.371/4 = -1.09275 -> -1.093\n        hour7: [ -0.497, -0.284, -1.137, -0.604 ] -> (-0.497-0.284-1.137-0.604) = -2.522/4 = -0.6305 -> -0.631\n        hour8: [ -0.213, -0.533, -0.640, -0.640 ] -> (-0.213-0.533-0.640-0.640) = -2.026/4 = -0.5065 -> -0.507\n        hour9: [ -1.528, -1.137, -2.416, -2.665 ] -> (-1.528-1.137-2.416-2.665) = -7.746/4 = -1.9365 -> -1.937\n        hour10: [ -1.670, -0.746, -0.959, -1.990 ] -> (-1.670-0.746-0.959-1.990) = -5.365/4 = -1.34125 -> -1.341\n        hour11: [ -1.883, -1.848, -1.208, -1.599 ] -> (-1.883-1.848-1.208-1.599) = -6.538/4 = -1.6345 -> -1.635\n        hour12: [ -2.203, -2.310, -2.949, -2.239 ] -> (-2.203-2.310-2.949-2.239) = -9.701/4 = -2.42525 -> -2.425\n        hour13: [ -2.097, -0.604, -2.274, -2.025 ] -> (-2.097-0.604-2.274-2.025) = -7.000/4 = -1.750\n        hour14: [ -1.173, -1.777, -2.523, -1.599 ] -> (-1.173-1.777-2.523-1.599) = -7.072/4 = -1.768\n        hour15: [ -0.426, -2.416, -2.487, -1.670 ] -> (-0.426-2.416-2.487-1.670) = -6.999/4 = -1.74975 -> -1.750\n        hour16: [ -1.350, -2.132, -2.274, -1.670 ] -> (-1.350-2.132-2.274-1.670) = -7.426/4 = -1.8565 -> -1.857\n        hour17: [ -1.706, -2.274, -2.559, -1.954 ] -> (-1.706-2.274-2.559-1.954) = -8.493/4 = -2.12325 -> -2.123\n        hour18: [ -2.878, -3.589, -3.092, -3.127 ] -> (-2.878-3.589-3.092-3.127) = -12.686/4 = -3.1715 -> -3.172\n        hour19: [ -2.487, -2.843, -2.949, -2.630 ] -> (-2.487-2.843-2.949-2.630) = -10.909/4 = -2.72725 -> -2.727\n        hour20: [ -2.559, -2.843, -2.949, -2.736 ] -> (-2.559-2.843-2.949-2.736) = -11.087/4 = -2.77175 -> -2.772\n        hour21: [ -3.376, -3.447, -3.838, -2.487 ] -> (-3.376-3.447-3.838-2.487) = -13.148/4 = -3.287\n        hour22: [ -1.528, -2.132, -1.777, -2.559 ] -> (-1.528-2.132-1.777-2.559) = -7.996/4 = -1.999\n        hour23: [ -0.533, -1.208, -0.995, 0.284 ] -> (-0.533-1.208-0.995+0.284) = -2.452/4 = -0.613\n\n 16. Now, we will create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating these 24 average values for each day.\n\n 17. The dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-26 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-09-26 01:00:00 ... until 2017-09-26 23:00:00 -> day1 of forecast\n      Then 2017-09-27 00:00:00 ... until 2017-09-27 23:00:00 -> day2 of forecast\n      Then 2017-09-28 00:00:00 ... until 2017-09-28 23:00:00 -> day3 of forecast\n      Then 2017-09-29 00:00:00 ... until 2017-09-29 23:00:00 -> day4 of forecast\n\n 18. For each day, the hour0 value is -0.195, hour1 is -0.933, ... hour23 is -0.613.\n\n 19. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 20. Note: We rounded the averages to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 21. Let's write the data:\n\n        date, MULL\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00, -0.195\n        2017-09-26 01:00:00, -0.933\n        2017-09-26 02:00:00, -0.631\n        2017-09-26 03:00:00, -0.302\n        2017-09-26 04:00:00, 0.009\n        2017-09-26 05:00:00, -0.542\n        2017-09-26 06:00:00, -1.093\n        2017-09-26 07:00:00, -0.631\n        2017-09-26 08:00:00, -0.507\n        2017-09-26 09:00:00, -1.937\n        2017-09-26 10:00:00, -1.341\n        2017-09-26 11:00:00, -1.635\n        2017-09-26 12:00:00, -2.425\n        2017-09-26 13:00:00, -1.750\n        2017-09-26 14:00:00, -1.768\n        2017-09-26 15:00:00, -1.750\n        2017-09-26 16:00:00, -1.857\n        2017-09-26 17:00:00, -2.123\n        2017-09-26 18:00:00, -3.172\n        2017-09-26 19:00:00, -2.727\n        2017-09-26 20:00:00, -2.772\n        2017-09-26 21:00:00, -3.287\n        2017-09-26 22:00:00, -1.999\n        2017-09-26 23:00:00, -0.613\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next three days.\n\n 22. But note: the pattern is the same for each day? Yes, because we are using the same average for each hour regardless of the day.\n\n 23. Therefore, the next 4 days will have the same 24 numbers repeated.\n\n 24. We output the entire 96 points.\n\n 25. However, note that the last day in the input is 2017-09-25, so the next day is 2017-09-26.\n\n 26. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 27. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 28. We must not omit any content.\n\n 29. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n               date   MULL\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00 -0.195\n        2017-09-26 01:00:00 -0.933\n        ... \n        2017-09-29 23:00:00 -0.613\n        </answer>\n\n 30. But note: the input data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Let's generate the data:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-26\n        Day2: 2017-09-27\n        Day3: 2017-09-28\n        Day4: 2017-09-29\n\n 32. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 33. We note that the average for hour0 is -0.195, hour1 is -0.933, ... hour23 is -0.613.\n\n 34. We repeat the 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 35. We must be cautious: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 36. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017,9,26,0,0,0)\n        then add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n 37. But we can do:\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                value = average[hour]\n\n 38. However, we are not coding but writing the data.\n\n 39. We write the data manually by repeating the 24 values 4 times.\n\n 40. The 24 values (averages) we computed:\n\n        hour0: -0.195\n        hour1: -0.933\n        hour2: -0.631\n        hour3: -0.302\n        hour4: 0.009\n        hour5: -0.542\n        hour6: -1.093\n        hour7: -0.631\n        hour8: -0.507\n        hour9: -1.937\n        hour10: -1.341\n        hour11: -1.635\n        hour12: -2.425\n        hour13: -1.750\n        hour14: -1.768\n        hour15: -1.750\n        hour16: -1.857\n        hour17: -2.123\n        hour18: -3.172\n        hour19: -2.727\n        hour20: -2.772\n        hour21: -3.287\n        hour22: -1.999\n        hour23: -0.613\n\n 41. Now, we write the data for 4 days.\n\n 42. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n               date   MULL\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00 -0.195\n        2017-09-26 01:00:00 -0.933\n        2017-09-26 02:00:00 -0.631\n        2017-09-26 03:00:00 -0.302\n        2017-09-26 04:00:00 0.009\n        2017-09-26 05:00:00 -0.542\n        2017-09-26 06:00:00 -1.093\n        2017-09-26 07:00:00 -0.631\n        2017-09-26 08:00:00 -0.507\n        2017-09-26 09:00:00 -1.937\n        2017-09-26 10:00:00 -1.341\n        2017-09-26 11:00:00 -1.635\n        2017-09-26 12:00:00 -2.425\n        2017-09-26 13:00:00 -1.750\n        2017-09-26 14:00:00 -1.768\n        2017-09-26 15:00:00 -1.750\n        2017-09-26 16:00:00 -1.857\n        2017-09-26 17:00:00 -2.123\n        2017-09-26 18:00:00 -3.172\n        2017-09-26 19:00:00 -2.727\n        2017-09-26 20:00:00 -2.772\n        2017-09-26 21:00:00 -3.287\n        2017-09-26 22:00:00 -1.999\n        2017-09-26 23:00:00 -0.613\n\n        Then for 2017-09-27: same 24 values.\n\n        2017-09-27 00:00:00 -0.195\n        2017-09-27 01:00:00 -0.933\n        ... until\n        2017-09-27 23:00:00 -0.613\n\n        Then 2017-09-28 and 2017-09-29.\n\n 43. We write all 96 lines.\n\n 44. We note: the last line of the forecast is 2017-09-29 23:00:00 with value -0.613.\n\n 45. We output in the exact format.\n\n 46. We must not omit any content.\n\n 47.
