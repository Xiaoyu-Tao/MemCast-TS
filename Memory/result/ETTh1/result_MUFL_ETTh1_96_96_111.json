        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). Also, there might be weekly patterns but we only have 4 days of data, so we focus on daily.\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we should be cautious. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values.\n    For forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete. If there were missing values, we would impute (e.g., linear interpolation or seasonal decomposition) but here we don't need to.\n\n 3. We choose a model: Given the seasonality and the relatively short history, we can use a seasonal model. \n    Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple seasons of 24 hours) and we have only 4 seasons (4 days), \n    we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has some irregularities (e.g., on 2017-09-18 07:00:00 there is a drop to 7.782 then 2.701, and then negative values during the day). \n    This might be due to the load pattern of the transformer.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, we will use a simple but effective method: \n    We can use a seasonal naive method, but that might not capture trends. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet or ETS.\n\n 6. But note: We are in a constrained environment (text-based) and must output the forecast without running actual code. \n    Therefore, we must rely on a simple extrapolation.\n\n 7. Approach: \n    We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the last known day's trend.\n\n    Steps for manual forecast:\n    a. Extract the daily seasonality: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n    b. But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the overall level of each day:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-09-18): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: average\n        Day 3: average\n        Day 4: average\n\n        If there is an increasing or decreasing trend, we can project that.\n\n    c. However, looking at the data:\n\n        Day 1: \n          Starts at 9.097, then goes down to -18.336, then up to 8.813 -> average = ?\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n        Day1: [9.097,7.853,6.965,6.965,6.219,7.0,7.782,2.701,-4.513,-11.798,-13.468,-15.280,-18.336,-16.986,-14.605,-11.051,-4.833,2.097,4.548,5.899,5.472,5.757,8.351,8.813]\n        Sum = 9.097+7.853+6.965+6.965+6.219+7.0+7.782+2.701-4.513-11.798-13.468-15.280-18.336-16.986-14.605-11.051-4.833+2.097+4.548+5.899+5.472+5.757+8.351+8.813\n\n        Let me calculate step by step:\n\n        Positive part: 9.097+7.853=16.95, +6.965=23.915, +6.965=30.88, +6.219=37.099, +7.0=44.099, +7.782=51.881, +2.701=54.582\n        Then negative: -4.513 -> 54.582-4.513=50.069, -11.798=38.271, -13.468=24.803, -15.280=9.523, -18.336=-8.813, -16.986=-25.799, -14.605=-40.404, -11.051=-51.455, -4.833=-56.288\n        Then positive: +2.097=-54.191, +4.548=-49.643, +5.899=-43.744, +5.472=-38.272, +5.757=-32.515, +8.351=-24.164, +8.813=-15.351\n\n        This doesn't look right.

But 4 points are too few. Alternatively, we can take the average of the last two days and project a slight decrease? \n        Or we can use the average of the entire period: total sum of all 96 points.\n\n        Total sum = (-15.351) + 125.084 + 120.82 + 97.438 = 327.991\n        Actually: -15.351 (day1) + 125.084 (day2) = 109.733, +120.82 = 230.553, +97.438 = 327.991\n        Average per hour for 96 hours: 327.991/96 = 3.4165729\n\n        But we are going to forecast the next 96 hours. We can use the daily pattern and adjust by the overall level.\n\n        However, note that the level of the series seems to be decreasing in the last two days. We might assume that the next 4 days will have a similar pattern but with a level that is the average of the last two days? \n\n        Let me take the average of the last two days: (5.0341667 + 4.0599167)/2 = 4.5470417\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day's average (4.0599167) and assume the next days will be around that.\n\n        But to be safe, we can use the overall average of the entire 4 days (3.4165729) for the level? \n\n        However, the last day was 4.05, which is above the overall average. \n\n        Another idea: use the daily seasonality (hourly pattern) from the entire 4 days and then adjust by the level of the last day? \n\n        Steps:\n\n        a. Compute the hourly average over the 4 days (for each of the 24 hours) to get the base pattern.\n        b. Then, we can adjust the level by the last day's average? But note: the last day's average was 4.05, and the overall average of the base pattern (the 24 hourly averages) should be the overall average (3.4165729). \n           So we can shift the base pattern by the difference: 4.05 - 3.4165729 = 0.6334271.\n\n        However, we are forecasting 4 days. We don't know if the level will stay at 4.05 or continue to decrease. \n\n        Since we don't have a strong trend, we can use the last day's level as the base for the next days.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days to set the level for each forecast day.\n\n        Given the simplicity, we are to provide a forecast, we do:\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days -> base_hourly_pattern.\n\n        Then, we set the level for the next 4 days to be the average of the last two days: (5.0341667 + 4.0599167)/2 = 4.5470417.\n\n        But note: the base_hourly_pattern has an average of 3.4165729. So we need to scale the base pattern so that its average becomes 4.5470417? \n\n        Alternatively, we can shift: \n          forecast for hour i = base_hourly_pattern[i] + (4.5470417 - 3.4165729) = base_hourly_pattern[i] + 1.1304688\n\n        But that might not be the best because the pattern might change in level.\n\n        Another method: use the last day's values as the base and then adjust by the average daily change? \n\n        However, the problem is complex and we are limited by the text. \n\n        Let me try to compute the base_hourly_pattern:\n\n        We have 4 days of data for each hour. We'll average the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Hour 0: (9.097 + 10.732 + 9.488 + 6.610)/4 = (9.927+16.098)/2? Let me compute:\n\n        9.097+10.732 = 19.829\n        9.488+6.610 = 16.098\n        total = 19.829+16.098 = 35.927 -> 35.927/4 = 8.98175\n\n        Similarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\n        But note: we are going to forecast 4 days. We can use this base pattern and then adjust by the level we want (4.5470417) by:\n\n        shift = 4.5470417 - (overall average of base pattern) \n        but the overall average of base pattern is 3.4165729, so shift = 1.1304688.\n\n        Then for each hour i in the next 96 hours, we do:\n\n        forecast = base_hourly_pattern[i mod 24] + 1.1304688\n\n        However, this might not capture the potential downward trend. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and then adjust by the average change from day3 to day4? \n\n        The change from day3 to day4: 4.0599167 - 5.0341667 = -0.97425\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we can project:\n\n        Day5: level = day4 level + (-0.97425) = 4.0599167 - 0.97425 = 3.0856667\n        Then Day6: 3.0856667 - 0.97425 = 2.1114167\n        Day7: 2.1114167 - 0.97425 = 1.1371667\n        Day8: 1.1371667 - 0.97425 = 0.1629167\n\n        Then for each day, we set the level relative to the base pattern? \n\n        But note: the base pattern has an average of 3.4165729. We want to set the daily level to the above values? \n\n        Then for day5, we would do:\n\n        forecast for hour i = base_hourly_pattern[i] + (3.0856667 - 3.4165729) = base_hourly_pattern[i] - 0.3309062\n\n        Similarly for day6: base_hourly_pattern[i] + (2.1114167 - 3.4165729) = base_hourly_pattern[i] - 1.3051562\n\n        This might be too drastic and the pattern might not continue to drop at that rate.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, I propose to use the average of the last two days (4.5470417) as the level for all 4 days? \n\n        So we do:\n\n        base_hourly_pattern (24 points) -> then shift by 1.1304688.\n\n        But let me compute the base_hourly_pattern for 24 hours:\n\n        Hour0: (9.097+10.732+9.488+6.610)/4 = 35.927/4 = 8.98175\n        Hour1: (7.853+10.127+9.559+7.036)/4 = (7.853+10.127=17.98; 9.559+7.036=16.595; total=34.575) -> 34.575/4=8.64375\n        Hour2: (6.965+7.320+8.422+6.965)/4 = (6.965+7.320=14.285; 8.422+6.965=15.387; total=29.672) -> 29.672/4=7.418\n        Hour3: (6.965+9.772+7.569+7.178)/4 = (6.965+9.772=16.737; 7.569+7.178=14.747; total=31.484) -> 31.484/4=7.871\n        Hour4: (6.219+8.848+7.818+6.965)/4 = (6.219+8.848=15.067; 7.818+6.965=14.783; total=29.85) -> 29.85/4=7.4625\n        Hour5: (7.000+8.493+8.635+6.467)/4 = (7.000+8.493=15.493; 8.635+6.467=15.102; total=30.595) -> 30.595/4=7.64875\n        Hour6: (7.782+8.493+7.391+6.290)/4 = (7.782+8.493=16.275; 7.391+6.290=13.681; total=29.956) -> 29.956/4=7.489\n        Hour7: (2.701+7.995+7.000+4.087)/4 = (2.701+7.995=10.696; 7.000+4.087=11.087; total=21.783) -> 21.783/4=5.44575\n        Hour8: (-4.513+6.183+6.894+4.477)/4 = (-4.513+6.183=1.67; 6.894+4.477=11.371; total=13.041) -> 13.041/4=3.26025\n        Hour9: (-11.798+0.853+4.797+3.234)/4 = (-11.798+0.853=-10.945; 4.797+3.234=8.031; total=-2.914) -> -2.914/4=-0.7285\n        Hour10: (-13.468+1.599+4.087-0.213)/4 = (-13.468+1.599=-11.869; 4.087-0.213=3.874; total=-7.995) -> -7.995/4=-1.99875\n        Hour11: (-15.280+1.244+4.833-3.518)/4 = (-15.280+1.244=-14.036; 4.833-3.518=1.315; total=-12.721) -> -12.721/4=-3.18025\n        Hour12: (-18.336+1.315+1.706+0.640)/4 = (-18.336+1.315=-17.021; 1.706+0.640=2.346; total=-14.675) -> -14.675/4=-3.66875\n        Hour13: (-16.986+0.746+1.386-5.010)/4 = (-16.986+0.746=-16.24; 1.386-5.010=-3.624; total=-19.864) -> -19.864/4=-4.966\n        Hour14: (-14.605-0.213-0.320+1.812)/4 = (-14.605-0.213=-14.818; -0.320+1.812=1.492; total=-13.326) -> -13.326/4=-3.3315\n        Hour15: (-11.051+2.381+0.853+2.665)/4 = (-11.051+2.381=-8.67; 0.853+2.665=3.518; total=-5.152) -> -5.152/4=-1.288\n        Hour16: (-4.833+3.163+1.492+3.127)/4 = (-4.833+3.163=-1.67; 1.492+3.127=4.619; total=2.949) -> 2.949/4=0.73725\n        Hour17: (2.097+4.904+3.873+4.442)/4 = (2.097+4.904=7.001; 3.873+4.442=8.315; total=15.316) -> 15.316/4=3.829\n        Hour18: (4.548+4.477+4.158+4.335)/4 = (4.548+4.477=9.025; 4.158+4.335=8.493; total=17.518) -> 17.518/4=4.3795\n        Hour19: (5.899+4.620+4.371+4.442)/4 = (5.899+4.620=10.519; 4.371+4.442=8.813; total=19.332) -> 19.332/4=4.833\n        Hour20: (5.472+4.122+4.015+4.051)/4 = (5.472+4.122=9.594; 4.015+4.051=8.066; total=17.66) -> 17.66/4=4.415\n        Hour21: (5.757+4.051+3.696+5.899)/4 = (5.757+4.051=9.808; 3.696+5.899=9.595; total=19.403) -> 19.403/4=4.85075\n        Hour22: (8.351+5.721+3.411+6.538)/4 = (8.351+5.721=14.072; 3.411+6.538=9.949; total=24.021) -> 24.021/4=6.00525\n        Hour23: (8.813+8.138+5.686+8.919)/4 = (8.813+8.138=16.951; 5.686+8.919=14.605; total=31.556) -> 31.556/4=7.889\n\n        Now, the average of these 24 base_hourly_pattern should be the overall average (3.4165729). Let me check:\n\n        We have: \n        [8.98175, 8.64375, 7.418, 7.871, 7.4625, 7.64875, 7.489, 5.44575, 3.26025, -0.7285, -1.99875, -3.18025, -3.66875, -4.966, -3.3315, -1.288, 0.73725, 3.829, 4.3795, 4.833, 4.415, 4.85075, 6.00525, 7.889]\n\n        Sum = \n        8.98175+8.64375=17.6255\n        +7.418=25.0435\n        +7.871=32.9145\n        +7.4625=40.377\n        +7.64875=48.02575\n        +7.489=55.51475\n        +5.44575=60.9605\n        +3.26025=64.22075\n        -0.7285=63.49225\n        -1.99875=61.4935\n        -3.18025=58.31325\n        -3.66875=54.6445\n        -4.966=49.6785\n        -3.3315=46.347\n        -1.288=45.059\n        +0.73725=45.79625\n        +3.829=49.62525\n        +4.3795=54.00475\n        +4.833=58.83775\n        +4.415=63.25275\n        +4.85075=68.1035\n        +6.00525=74.10875\n        +7.889=81.99775\n\n        Total = 81.99775, then divided by 24: 81.99775/24 = 3.4165729 -> matches.\n\n        Now, we want to shift by 1.1304688 to get the level to 4.5470417 (the average of last two days).\n\n        So for each hour i in the next 96 hours:\n\n        Let d = day index (0 to 3 for the 4 forecast days)\n        Let h = hour index (0 to 23)\n\n        The forecast for day d, hour h = base_hourly_pattern[h] + 1.1304688\n\n        But note: we are not adjusting for any trend, so all 4 days will be the same pattern.\n\n        However, the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are forecasting and we assume no missing in the forecast.\n\n        We generate 96 points: starting at 2017-09-22 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-09-21 23:00:00) and then every hour until 96 hours.\n\n        We'll generate 4 days: 2017-09-22, 23, 24, 25.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n        2017-09-22 00:00:00, <forecast for hour0>\n        2017-09-22 01:00:00, <forecast for hour1>\n        ...\n        2017-09-22 23:00:00, <forecast for hour23>\n        then 2017-09-23 00:00:00, same as hour0 again, etc.\n\n        So:\n\n        Let F(h) = base_hourly_pattern[h] + 1.1304688\n\n        Then:\n\n        Hour0: 8.98175 + 1.1304688 = 10.1122188\n        Hour1: 8.64375 + 1.1304688 = 9.7742188\n        ... and so on.\n\n        We'll compute all 24 and then repeat for 4 days.\n\n        But note: the base pattern was computed from 4 days that had a decreasing trend.
