        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load drops during the day and rises at night.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we are to be cautious for the forecast.\n 3. We can use a time series model that captures seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data is hourly with daily seasonality (period=24), \n    can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality), or even a simple seasonal naive.\n\n However, note: \n   - The data is very short (only 4 days) so complex models might not be feasible.\n   - We are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and must provide the complete data.\n\n Approach:\n   Given the short history, we can use a seasonal naive method: \n        y_{t+h} = y_{t+h - 24*k}   where k is chosen so that h - 24*k is in the range of the last season.\n\n   Specifically, for the next 24 hours (day 5) we can use the values of day 4 (2016-08-13) as the forecast.\n   Then for day 6, we use day 5? But we don't have day 5, so we have to use the same pattern? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n   Let's break the 96 hours into 4 days of 24 hours. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n   Steps for average method:\n     - Group by hour (i.e., the time of day: 0,1,...,23) and take the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same pattern: repeat the computed 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n   Why this method?\n     - It's simple and handles seasonality.\n     - With only 4 days, we don't have a long history for more complex models.\n\n   But note: the data shows some variation from day to day. However, without more history, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 4. However, we must also consider that the problem says there are missing values. In the provided data, there are none. But for the forecast, we are not given any, so we proceed.\n\n 5. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (14.036 + 10.163 + 13.823 + 14.676) / 4\n        hour1: (13.077 + 8.990 + 13.183 + 14.214) / 4\n        ... and so on.\n\n 6. Then we create 4 repetitions of these 24 averages.\n\n 7. The dates for the next 96 hours start from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse the given data into a DataFrame (if we were coding) but since we are to do it manually, we'll do the calculations.\n\n   Step 2: Extract the hour of the day for each record. The first 24 are day1, next 24 day2, etc.\n\n   Step 3: For each hour in 0-23, average the 4 values we have.\n\n   Step 4: Generate the next 96 dates: starting from 2016-08-14 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 5: Assign the average values for the corresponding hour of the day, repeated for 4 days.\n\n 8. But note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the 4 days, the values on the last day (2016-08-13) are generally higher than the first day? \n    However, with only 4 days, it's hard to say. We might also consider using the last season (i.e., the last day) if we believe the most recent day is the most representative.\n\n 9. Given the instructions and the short history, the average method is a safe choice.\n\n Let's calculate the hourly averages:\n\n   Hour 0 (00:00): [14.036, 10.163, 13.823, 14.676] -> (14.036+10.163+13.823+14.676)/4 = 52.698/4 = 13.1745\n   Hour 1 (01:00): [13.077, 8.990, 13.183, 14.214] -> (13.077+8.990+13.183+14.214)/4 = 49.464/4 = 12.366\n   Hour 2 (02:00): [13.219, 8.386, 13.326, 12.331] -> (13.219+8.386+13.326+12.331)/4 = 47.262/4 = 11.8155\n   Hour 3 (03:00): [12.722, 8.955, 12.366, 13.112] -> (12.722+8.955+12.366+13.112)/4 = 47.155/4 = 11.78875\n   Hour 4 (04:00): [12.011, 8.351, 11.904, 12.828] -> (12.011+8.351+11.904+12.828)/4 = 45.094/4 = 11.2735\n   Hour 5 (05:00): [12.579, 7.853, 10.447, 11.336] -> (12.579+7.853+10.447+11.336)/4 = 42.215/4 = 10.55375\n   Hour 6 (06:00): [13.006, 8.813, 10.341, 9.701] -> (13.006+8.813+10.341+9.701)/4 = 41.861/4 = 10.46525\n   Hour 7 (07:00): [12.935, 6.894, 10.127, 9.666] -> (12.935+6.894+10.127+9.666)/4 = 39.622/4 = 9.9055\n   Hour 8 (08:00): [10.661, 7.782, 9.488, 10.518] -> (10.661+7.782+9.488+10.518)/4 = 38.449/4 = 9.61225\n   Hour 9 (09:00): [8.244, 8.031, 8.066, 8.386] -> (8.244+8.031+8.066+8.386)/4 = 32.727/4 = 8.18175\n   Hour 10 (10:00): [7.995, 8.635, 8.990, 9.132] -> (7.995+8.635+8.990+9.132)/4 = 34.752/4 = 8.688\n   Hour 11 (11:00): [8.066, 8.884, 9.097, 9.275] -> (8.066+8.884+9.097+9.275)/4 = 35.322/4 = 8.8305\n   Hour 12 (12:00): [7.889, 8.848, 9.132, 9.737] -> (7.889+8.848+9.132+9.737)/4 = 35.606/4 = 8.9015\n   Hour 13 (13:00): [8.209, 9.310, 9.772, 10.199] -> (8.209+9.310+9.772+10.199)/4 = 37.49/4 = 9.3725\n   Hour 14 (14:00): [8.564, 9.097, 9.132, 9.914] -> (8.564+9.097+9.132+9.914)/4 = 36.707/4 = 9.17675\n   Hour 15 (15:00): [8.280, 9.061, 8.990, 9.559] -> (8.280+9.061+8.990+9.559)/4 = 35.89/4 = 8.9725\n   Hour 16 (16:00): [7.853, 8.386, 8.635, 8.777] -> (7.853+8.386+8.635+8.777)/4 = 33.651/4 = 8.41275\n   Hour 17 (17:00): [7.711, 7.285, 8.422, 8.742] -> (7.711+7.285+8.422+8.742)/4 = 32.16/4 = 8.04\n   Hour 18 (18:00): [6.894, 2.487, 7.462, 8.280] -> (6.894+2.487+7.462+8.280)/4 = 25.123/4 = 6.28075\n   Hour 19 (19:00): [7.747, 6.183, 8.066, 9.417] -> (7.747+6.183+8.066+9.417)/4 = 31.413/4 = 7.85325\n   Hour 20 (20:00): [10.909, 11.300, 11.655, 12.615] -> (10.909+11.300+11.655+12.615)/4 = 46.479/4 = 11.61975\n   Hour 21 (21:00): [10.376, 11.051, 11.194, 11.975] -> (10.376+11.051+11.194+11.975)/4 = 44.596/4 = 11.149\n   Hour 22 (22:00): [10.767, 13.041, 15.635, 12.935] -> (10.767+13.041+15.635+12.935)/4 = 52.378/4 = 13.0945\n   Hour 23 (23:00): [10.021, 12.970, 14.676, 12.508] -> (10.021+12.970+14.676+12.508)/4 = 50.175/4 = 12.54375\n\n 10.
