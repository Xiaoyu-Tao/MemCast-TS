        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for LUFL (Low UseFul Load) from 2017-06-30 00:00:00 to 2017-07-03 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 96 consecutive hours).\n 3. We need to choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data size is small (96 points) and we are to forecast 96 points ahead, \n    we can use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet. However, without extensive history, we must be cautious.\n\n Considering the data:\n   - The data shows a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). For example, on each day we see a similar pattern: \n        values dip during the early hours and then rise during the day.\n\n Approach:\n   We can use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n\n Since the data is short, we can try:\n   - SARIMA: We need to find parameters (p,d,q) and seasonal parameters (P,D,Q,s) with s=24.\n\n However, note that 96 points is only 4 days, which is very short for a seasonal model with 24 periods. \n Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like a seasonal naive forecast or use a moving average.\n\n But the problem requires a forecast for 96 points, and we must account for the pattern.\n\n Another idea: \n   We can use the average of the last 4 days (each day has 24 hours) to forecast the next 4 days? \n   However, the pattern might change slightly. We can also try to use the last day and adjust by the trend.\n\n However, the data does not showing a strong trend over the 4 days, but rather a daily seasonality.\n\n Let's break down the data by day:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-06-30): \n        Min: 2.528, Max: 3.594\n   Day 2 (2017-07-01): \n        Min: 1.980, Max: 3.259\n   Day 3 (2017-07-02): \n        Min: 1.919, Max: 3.625\n   Day 4 (2017-07-03): \n        Min: 2.224, Max: 3.746\n\n We see that the maximum and minimum vary. Also, the pattern on each day is similar but not identical.\n\n Given the constraints, one simple method is to use the average of the same hour across the available days.\n\n How many days do we have? 4 days.\n\n For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we use the same 24-hour pattern (the computed average for each hour) repeated 4 times.\n\n But note: the last day (2017-07-03) might be the most recent and we might want to give it more weight? \n However, without a clear trend, we can use a simple average.\n\n Steps for the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00):\n\n   For hour 0 (00:00): average of [3.046 (2017-06-30 00:00), 2.132 (2017-07-01 00:00), 2.071 (2017-07-02 00:00), 2.680 (2017-07-03 00:00)] \n        (3.046 + 2.132 + 2.071 + 2.680) / 4 = (9.929) / 4 = 2.48225\n\n   Similarly for hour 1, 2, ... 23.\n\n Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data might have a slight trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n   Day1: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n   Day2: ...\n   But we don't see a clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model, but with only 4 days, it's challenging.\n\n Considering the above, we will use the average of each hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? \n   In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n However, if we are to be more accurate, we might use exponential smoothing for the seasonal indices? \n   But with only 4 cycles, it's hard.\n\n We'll go with the average per hour.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and collect the values for that hour from the 4 days.\n\n   Then compute the mean for each hour index h (0<=h<24):\n\n   value_h = (day1_h + day2_h + day3_h + day4_h) / 4\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days:\n\n   Day 5 (2017-07-04): [value_0, value_1, ..., value_23]\n   Day 6 (2017-07-05): [value_0, value_1, ..., value_23]\n   Day 7 (2017-07-06): [value_0, value_1, ..., value_23]\n   Day 8 (2017-07-07): [value_0, value_1, ..., value_23]\n\n But note: the last timestamp we have is 2017-07-03 23:00:00.\n\n The next 96 hours start at 2017-07-04 00:00:00 and end at 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average.\n\n   Then we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n However, note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can reshape the LUFL column into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n   data = [3.046, 3.076, ... , 2.406]  (96 values)\n\n   Reshape: \n        day0: [3.046, 3.076, ... , 2.589]   (24 values)\n        day1: [2.132, 2.163, ... , 2.193]   (24 values)\n        day2: [2.071, 1.980, ... , 2.589]   (24 values)\n        day3: [2.680, 2.406, ... , 2.406]   (24 values)\n\n   Then for each column (hour) in the matrix, compute the mean.\n\n   Let's do it:\n\n   hour0: [3.046, 2.132, 2.071, 2.680] -> mean = (3.046+2.132+2.071+2.680)/4 = 9.929/4 = 2.48225\n   hour1: [3.076, 2.163, 1.980, 2.406] -> (3.076+2.163+1.980+2.406)/4 = 9.625/4 = 2.40625\n   ... and so on.\n\n   Then we create the forecast for the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: we are rounding the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the original data? \n   The original data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the problem does not specify rounding, but the input has 3 decimals. We'll output 3 decimals.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   We'll create a list of 24 values (each being the average for that hour).\n\n   Then the forecast will be that list repeated 4 times.\n\n   The dates: starting from 2017-07-04 00:00:00, then 2017-07-04 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation in code (pseudocode):\n\n   hours = list(range(24))\n   averages = []\n   for h in hours:\n        values = [day0[h], day1[h], day2[h], day3[h]]\n        avg = sum(values) / 4\n        averages.append(round(avg, 3))\n\n   Then forecast = averages * 4   (i.e., 4 days)\n\n But note: the data we have is in order. We can reshape the LUFL column.\n\n Let me extract the LUFL values:\n\n   data = [3.046, 3.076, 2.772, 2.559, 2.711, 3.046, 3.076, 3.472, 3.015, 2.924, 3.594, 3.320, 3.076, 2.741, 2.528, 2.650, 2.528, 2.985, 2.680, 2.711, 3.442, 2.894, 2.863, 2.589, \n           2.132, 2.163, 2.071, 1.980, 1.980, 2.711, 2.772, 2.741, 2.863, 2.955, 3.259, 3.259, 2.680, 2.680, 2.315, 2.345, 2.619, 3.137, 2.498, 2.680, 2.985, 2.467, 2.406, 2.193, \n           \n           2.071, 1.980, 2.132, 2.345, 2.224, 2.833, 3.046, 3.320, 3.290, 3.015, 3.503, 3.625, 3.168, 2.559, 2.437, 1.919, 2.071, 2.680, 2.711, 2.833, 3.290, 2.955, 2.955, 2.589, \n           \n           2.680, 2.406, 2.224, 2.345, 2.315, 2.741, 3.350, 3.168, 3.746, 3.107, 3.564, 3.503, 3.107, 3.442, 3.076, 2.955, 3.168, 3.716, 3.198, 3.076, 3.320, 3.076, 2.589, 2.406]\n\n We can reshape into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n Let me do it:\n\n   day0 = data[0:24]\n   day1 = data[24:48]\n   day2 = data[48:72]\n   day3 = data[72:96]\n\n   Then for each hour index h (0 to 23):\n\n        hour_h = [day0[h], day1[h], day2[h], day3[h]]\n\n   Then compute the hour_h.\n\n Example for h=0 (first hour of the day):\n\n        [3.046, 2.132, 2.071, 2.680] -> 2.929/4? Let me calculate: 3.046+2.132=5.178, +2.071=7.249, +2.680=9.929 -> 9.929/4 = 2.48225 -> rounded to 2.482\n\n   h=1: [3.076, 2.163, 1.980, 2.406] -> 3.076+2.163=5.239, +1.980=7.219, +2.406=9.625 -> 9.625/4=2.40625 -> 2.406\n\n   h=2: [2.772, 2.071, 2.132, 2.224] -> 2.772+2.071=4.843, +2.132=6.975, +2.224=9.199 -> 9.199/4=2.29975 -> 2.300\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll compute all 24.\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days is:\n\n   Day1: [h0, h1, ... h23] -> 24 values\n   Day2: [h0, h1, ... h23] -> 24 values\n   Day3: [h0, h1, ... h23] -> 24 values\n   Day4: [h0, h1, ... h23] -> 24 values\n\n Total 96 values.\n\n Now, we must generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-07-04 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n   The last date: 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   date = start_date = \"2017-07-04 00:00:00\"\n\n   Then next: \n        2017-07-04 00:00:00\n        2017-07-04 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-07-04 23:00:00\n        2017-07-05 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-07-07 23:00:00\n\n We can use pandas to generate, but we are not running code.
