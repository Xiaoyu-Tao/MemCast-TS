        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We must handle the forecasting considering the possibility of missing values in the future? However, the problem says the data we are going to forecast may have missing values? \n    But note: the instruction says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided past might have missing values? However, the provided past data is complete (96 consecutive hours).\n    Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" - meaning the entire dataset (including the future we are to predict) might have missing values? \n    However, the instruction also says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we are to provide 96 values without missing? \n\n 3. Since the problem states that the data is sampled every hour, we assume the next 96 are consecutive hours.\n\n 4. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 5. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 hours in the same format.\n\n Approach:\n Given the small size of data (only 96 points) and the need for forecasting 96 points, we are going to use a model that can handle time series with multiple seasonality.\n The data shows a clear daily pattern (24 hours). We can also note that there might be weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly.\n\n We can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality. However, with only 4 days, fitting a seasonal model with daily seasonality (period=24) might be challenging.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method like:\n   - Last value carried forward? Not good for 96 steps.\n   - Moving average? \n   - Or more advanced: Prophet, but we don't have the package and we are to do it in code.\n\n Since we are in a constrained environment, we can use a simple statistical model: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with seasonality of 24.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to output the forecast without coding? We are to simulate the forecast.\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the forecast.\n\n Given the constraints, we can do:\n\n  - We can use the average of each hour of the day from the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? That would be naive.\n\n  But let's look at the data: \n  We have 4 days: 2017-03-14, 2017-03-15, 2017-03-16, 2017-03-17.\n\n  We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over these 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21).\n\n  However, note that the data does not look exactly the same every day. But without more data, it's a simple approach.\n\n  Steps for the data:\n\n  We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n  We can group by hour (i.e., the hour of the day: 0,1,...,23) and take the mean.\n\n  Then for the next 4 days, we repeat the same pattern.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are to forecast the next 96, and we are to provide complete data.\n\n  We are going to assume that the pattern repeats.\n\n  However, let's check the data for each day:\n\n  Day 1 (2017-03-14): \n      00:00: 1.072, 01:00: 1.407, ... 23:00: 0.737\n\n  Day 2 (2017-03-15): \n      00:00: 2.813, 01:00: 2.679, ... 23:00: 0.335\n\n  Day 3 (2017-03-16): \n      00:00: 0.804, ... \n\n  Day 4 (2017-03-17): \n      00:00: 1.474, ... 23:00: 1.273\n\n  We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n  For hour 0: (1.072 + 2.813 + 0.804 + 1.474) / 4 = (1.072+2.813=3.885; 3.885+0.804=4.689; 4.689+1.474=6.163) -> 6.163/4 = 1.54075\n\n  Similarly for hour 1: (1.407+2.679+1.) -> 1.407+2.679=4.086; 4.086+1.206 (from day3: 01:00? Actually day3 01:00 is 1.206? Let me check: \n      day3: 2017-03-16 01:00:00 -> 1.206? Actually the data for day3: \n          2017-03-16 00:00:00  0.804\n          2017-03-16 01:00:00  1.206   -> yes.\n\n      day4: 2017-03-17 01:00:00 -> 1.474? Actually:\n          2017-03-17 00:00:00  1.474\n          2017-03-17 01:00:00  1.474   -> so hour1 of day4 is 1.474.\n\n      So hour1: (1.407 + 2.679 + 1.206 + 1.474) / 4 = (1.407+2.679=4.086; 4.086+1.206=5.292; 5.292+1.474=6.766) -> 6.766/4 = 1.6915\n\n  We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21) will be the same pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are to provide the complete data, so we are going to output 96 values without missing.\n\n  However, this method does not account for any trend. We have only 4 days, so we cannot see a long-term trend. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a model that uses the last day and then adjusts by the average pattern? But without more data, the average pattern might be the best.\n\n  Let's do:\n\n      Step 1: Create a list of the 96 values we have.\n      Step 2: Reshape into a 4x24 matrix.\n      Step 3: Compute the mean for each column (each hour of the day) -> we get 24 values.\n      Step 4: Repeat these 24 values 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n  But note: the data might have a trend? We can also consider a weighted average? However, without more data, we stick to simple average.\n\n  However, let's check the overall pattern: the values on day1 and day2 are higher than day3 and day4? Not exactly: day1: 2017-03-14, day2: 2017-03-15, day3: 2017-03-16, day4: 2017-03-17.\n\n  We can also consider using the median? to be robust to outliers? But we have only 4 points per hour.\n\n  Given the small data, we use the mean.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      We'll compute the mean for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n      Then we create the next 96 hours:\n\n          Start from 2017-03-18 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n\n      The values for:\n          2017-03-18 00:00:00 = mean of hour0\n          2017-03-18 01:00:00 = mean of hour1\n          ... \n          2017-03-18 23:00:00 = mean of hour23\n          2017-03-19 00:00:00 = mean of hour0\n          ... and so on.\n\n  Let's compute the means:\n\n      We'll list the 4 days in order:\n\n        Day0: 2017-03-14 -> index 0 to 23\n        Day1: 2017-03-15 -> index 24 to 47\n        Day2: 2017-03-16 -> index 48 to 71\n        Day3: 2017-03-17 -> index 72 to 95\n\n      For hour0 (00:00): indices 0, 24, 48, 72 -> values: 1.072, 2.813, 0.804, 1.474 -> mean = (1.072+2.813+0.804+1.474)/4 = 6.163/4 = 1.54075\n      For hour1 (01:00): indices 1,25,49,73 -> 1.407, 2.679, 1.206, 1.474 -> (1.407+2.679+1.206+1.474)=6.766 -> 1.6915\n      For hour2 (02:00): indices 2,26,50,74 -> 1.407, 2.009, 1.340, 0.938 -> (1.407+2.009+1.340+0.938)=5.694 -> 1.4235\n      For hour3 (03:00): indices 3,27,51,75 -> 1.139, 1.474, 0.670, 0.201 -> (1.139+1.474+0.670+0.201)=3.484 -> 0.871\n      For hour4 (04:00): indices 4,28,52,76 -> 1.139, 1.340, 2.009, 0.335 -> (1.139+1.340+2.009+0.335)=4.823 -> 1.20575\n      For hour5 (05:00): indices 5,29,53,77 -> 0.469, 2.009, 0.603, 1.005 -> (0.469+2.009+0.603+1.005)=4.086 -> 1.0215\n      For hour6 (06:00): indices 6,30,54,78 -> -0.201, 0.670, 0.000, 0.670 -> (-0.201+0.670+0.000+0.670)=1.139 -> 0.28475\n      For hour7 (07:00): indices 7,31,55,79 -> 0.804, 2.009, 1.072, 2.076 -> (0.804+2.009+1.072+2.076)=5.961 -> 1.49025\n      For hour8 (08:00): indices 8,32,56,80 -> 1.608, 2.009, 1.139, 1.808 -> (1.608+2.009+1.139+1.808)=6.564 -> 1.641\n      For hour9 (09:00): indices 9,33,57,81 -> 1.474, 1.139, 0.402, 0.737 -> (1.474+1.139+0.402+0.737)=3.752 -> 0.938\n      For hour10 (10:00): indices 10,34,58,82 -> 1.273, 2.746, 1.407, 0.938 -> (1.273+2.746+1.407+0.938)=6.364 -> 1.591\n      For hour11 (11:00): indices 11,35,59,83 -> 1.206, 2.746, 0.871, 1.072 -> (1.206+2.746+0.871+1.072)=5.895 -> 1.47375\n      For hour12 (12:00): indices 12,36,60,84 -> 1.206, 0.804, 1.340, 0.000 -> (1.206+0.804+1.340+0.000)=3.35 -> 0.8375\n      For hour13 (13:00): indices 13,37,61,85 -> 1.407, 1.340, 1.206, 1.005 -> (1.407+1.340+1.206+1.005)=4.958 -> 1.2395\n      For hour14 (14:00): indices 14,38,62,86 -> 1.875, 1.942, 1.474, 0.603 -> (1.875+1.942+1.474+0.603)=5.894 -> 1.4735\n      For hour15 (15:00): indices 15,39,63,87 -> 1.139, 0.000, 1.674, 1.072 -> (1.139+0.000+1.674+1.072)=3.885 -> 0.97125\n      For hour16 (16:00): indices 16,40,64,88 -> 0.000, -0.268, 0.469, 0.000 -> (0.000-0.268+0.469+0.000)=0.201 -> 0.05025\n      For hour17 (17:00): indices 17,41,65,89 -> -0.469, -0.469, -0.067, -0.536 -> (-0.469-0.469-0.067-0.536)= -1.541 -> -0.38525\n      For hour18 (18:00): indices 18,42,66,90 -> -0.871, -1.340, -1.072, -0.804 -> (-0.871-1.340-1.072-0.804)= -4.087 -> -1.02175\n      For hour19 (19:00): indices 19,43,67,91 -> -1.072, -1.139, -0.938, -1.206 -> (-1.072-1.139-0.938-1.206)= -4.355 -> -1.08875\n      For hour20 (20:00): indices 20,44,68,92 -> -0.938, -1.206, -1.139, -1.340 -> (-0.938-1.206-1.139-1.340)= -4.623 -> -1.15575\n      For hour21 (21:00): indices 21,45,69,93 -> -0.737, -1.206, -1.139, -1.541 -> (-0.737-1.206-1.139-1.541)= -4.623 -> -1.15575\n      For hour22 (22:00): indices 22,46,70,94 -> 0.067, -0.536, -0.469, 0.067 -> (0.067-0.536-0.469+0.067)= -0.871 -> -0.21775\n      For hour23 (23:00): indices 23,47,71,95 -> 0.737, 0.335, 0.737, 1.273 -> (0.737+0.335+0.737+1.273)=3.082 -> 0.7705\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n      Day1: 2017-03-18: [1.54075, 1.6915, 1.4235, 0.871, 1.20575, 1.0215, 0.28475, 1.49025, 1.641, 0.938, 1.591, 1.47375, 0.8375, 1.2395, 1.4735, 0.97125, 0.05025, -0.38525, -1.02175, -1.08875, -1.15575, -1.15575, -0.21775, 0.7705]\n      Day2: 2017-03-19: same as above\n      Day3: 2017-03-20: same as above\n      Day4: 2017-03-21: same as above\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?

The problem does not specify.

We computed the pattern as rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n  Actually, we have the pattern as a list of numbers that are already rounded to 3 decimals? \n\n  However, we stored them as floats and we want to output with 3 decimal places? \n\n  We can format the value as: \"{:.3f}\".format(value)\n\n  But note: negative numbers: we have negative values.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n        line = \"{} {:.3f}\".format(date_str, pattern[i % 24])\n\n  But wait: the pattern we computed is already rounded? For example, the first value is 1.541 -> that is 1.541, which is 3 decimal.\n\n  However, when we output 1.541, it will be \"1.541\", which is 3 decimal.\n\n  But what about 0.285? it will be \"0.285\", and 0.050 -> \"0.050\", and -0.385 -> \"-0.385\", and -1.022 -> \"-1.022\".\n\n  This matches the input format.\n\n  So we are good.\n\n  We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n  We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n  Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
