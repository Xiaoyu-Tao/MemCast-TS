        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series structure with hourly frequency.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided data we don't see any (we have 96 consecutive hours). However, we are warned that the data may have missing values. Since the provided data does not missing, we proceed to model the time series.\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the clear daily seasonality (as seen in the data: values drop during the day and rise at night), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data has:\n   - A daily pattern (period=24)\n   - Also, there might be a weekly pattern, but we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Since we only have 4 days, we cannot model weekly seasonality. Therefore, we will model with daily seasonality.\n\n We can use:\n   - SARIMA: but with only 96 points, and we need to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days) we might overfit if we use a complex model.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be unstable.\n\n Another approach: Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality. But again, with only 4 days, the seasonal pattern might not be stable.\n\n Given the constraints, we can try:\n   - A naive approach: use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But the data shows that the level changes from day to day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that uses the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But note: the data starts on a Friday and ends on a Monday? (We don't have the day of week, but 2016-12-16 is a Friday, then Saturday, Sunday, Monday). So the next 96 hours would be Tuesday to Friday? We don't have a Tuesday in the history.\n\n Due to the limited data, we might use a model that captures the daily pattern and the trend.\n\n We can use:\n   - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive or multiplicative seasonality). We have 4 days, so we can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   - Check for missing values and impute if necessary (here we don't have missing in the provided 96 points).\n   - Fit a Holt-Winters model with seasonality period 24.\n\n However, we are not coding but we have to produce the forecast.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. Since we are only given 96 points without missing, we assume the provided segment is complete.\n\n How to generate the forecast without code?\n   We can use a simple average method per hour of the day. We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 observations. We can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the level of the series might be changing. We can adjust by the overall level.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n   - Calculate the daily average for each of the 4 days.\n   - Then, for each hour, compute the relative value (as a percentage of the daily average) and then average that percentage for the same hour.\n   - Then, for the next 4 days, we can use the last day's daily average (or an average of the last few days) and then apply the seasonal index.\n\n But note: we are forecasting 4 days, and we have 4 days of history. We don't have a clear trend.\n\n Let me try a simple method:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the daily average for the 4 days.\n        Day1 (2016-12-16): average of 24 hours\n        Day2: average\n        Day3: average\n        Day4: average\n\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the seasonal index (as the average of the value for that hour divided by the daily average of the corresponding day).\n\n   Step 3: For the next 4 days, we need a base level. We can use the average of the last day (day4) as the base for the next day? Or we can use the average of the last 4 days? Since we don't have a trend, we can use the average of the last 4 days as the base for each of the next 4 days? But that would be constant. Alternatively, we can use the last day's average and then assume the same level for the next 4 days? Or we can use a moving average of the last 4 days and project that as the daily level for the next 4 days.\n\n   However, note: the daily averages of the 4 days are:\n        Day1: (10.767+10.305+...+10.803)/24 -> let's calculate roughly: \n            We can see the values: high at night, low during the day. \n            We don't calculate exactly because we are not coding, but we can approximate.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: just take the average of the same hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n   Example: \n        Hour 00:00: [10.767, 11.194, 9.879, 11.407] -> average = (10.767+11.194+9.879+11.407)/4 = 10.81175\n        Then for the next 4 days at 00:00, we use 10.81175 for each.\n\n   But this ignores any trend. However, the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n   Let me check the daily averages:\n\n        Day1: \n            Sum = 10.767+10.305+9.417+9.097+8.493+6.858+7.391+9.204+9.879+6.858+6.681+7.782+4.797+6.148+6.823+6.929+6.396+6.752+6.041+6.219+5.792+7.071+8.599+10.803\n            Let me compute step by step (roughly, we can group):\n            Night: 10.767+10.305+9.417+9.097+8.493+10.803 = ~59.88\n            Day: the rest: \n                6.858+7.391+9.204+9.879+6.858+6.681+7.782+4.797+6.148+6.823+6.929+6.396+6.752+6.041+6.219+5.792+7.071+8.599 = \n                Let me add: \n                6.858+7.391=14.249; +9.204=23.453; +9.879=33.332; +6.858=40.19; +6.681=46.871; +7.782=54.653; +4.797=59.45; +6.148=65.598; +6.823=72.421; +6.929=79.35; +6.396=85.746; +6.752=92.498; +6.041=98.539; +6.219=104.758; +5.792=110.55; +7.071=117.621; +8.599=126.22\n            Total = 59.88 (night) + 126.22 (day) = 186.1 -> average = 186.1/24 = 7.754\n\n        Day2: \n            We have: 11.194,12.295,13.006,12.402,12.402,11.087,10.803,12.011,11.869,7.711,6.716,6.858,4.868,5.757,5.721,5.615,6.076,6.219,5.970,5.970,5.401,4.868,6.716,8.066\n            Night: 11.194+12.295+13.006+12.402+12.402+8.066 = 69.365\n            Day: the rest: 11.087+10.803+12.011+11.869+7.711+6.716+6.858+4.868+5.757+5.721+5.615+6.076+6.219+5.970+5.970+5.401+4.868+6.716 = \n                11.087+10.803=21.89; +12.011=33.901; +11.869=45.77; +7.711=53.481; +6.716=60.197; +6.858=67.055; +4.868=71.923; +5.757=77.68; +5.721=83.401; +5.615=89.016; +6.076=95.092; +6.219=101.311; +5.970=107.281; +5.970=113.251; +5.401=118.652; +4.868=123.52; +6.716=130.236\n            Total = 69.365 + 130.236 = 199.601 -> average = 8.3167\n\n        Day3:\n            9.879,10.447,10.412,9.594,7.249,9.666,7.782,7.604,8.813,8.884,6.716,7.143,4.371,5.224,5.828,6.325,6.325,6.076,6.148,6.396,5.508,6.716,8.884,8.422\n            Night: 9.879+10.447+10.412+9.594+8.422 = 48.754? (but note: 7.249 and 9.666 are early morning? We have 00:00 to 23:00, so night hours are the first few and last few? Actually, we see that the high values are the beginning and end. Let me take the first 5 and last 1? \n            Actually, we can just compute the entire day: \n            Sum = 9.879+10.447+10.412+9.594+7.249+9.666+7.782+7.604+8.813+8.884+6.716+7.143+4.371+5.224+5.828+6.325+6.325+6.076+6.148+6.396+5.508+6.716+8.884+8.422\n            We can add: \n            First 5: 9.879+10.447+10.412+9.594+7.249 = 47.581\n            Then: 9.666+7.782+7.604+8.813+8.884 = 43.749 -> total so far 91.33\n            Then: 6.716+7.143=13.859; +4.371=18.23; +5.224=23.454; +5.828=29.282; +6.325=35.607; +6.325=41.932; +6.076=48.008; +6.148=54.156; +6.396=60.552; +5.508=66.06; +6.716=72.776; +8.884=81.66; +8.422=90.082\n            Total = 91.33 + 90.082? That doesn't match because I double counted? Actually, I did the first 5 and then the next 5, then the rest 14? Actually, I did 5+5+14=24. So total = 47.581 (first5) + 43.749 (next5) + 90.082 (last14) -> that's 181.412? But that doesn't seem right because the last14 includes the last 14? Actually, the last14 are from index 10 to 23? \n\n            Let me do it properly: \n            We have 24 numbers. We can just add them in groups:\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the fact that we have the numbers. But since we are not coding, we can approximate: \n            The numbers are between 4.371 and 10.447. The average might be around 7.5? \n\n            Actually, let me do a rough sum: \n            9.9+10.4+10.4+9.6+7.2+9.7+7.8+7.6+8.8+8.9+6.7+7.1+4.4+5.2+5.8+6.3+6.3+6.1+6.1+6.4+5.5+6.7+8.9+8.4\n            Rounding: \n            10+10+10+10+7+10+8+8+9+9+7+7+4+5+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+7+9+8 = \n            First 4: 40, then 7 -> 47, then 10 ->57, then 8+8=16 ->73, then 9+9=18 ->91, then 7+7=14 ->105, then 4+5=9 ->114, then 6*6=30 ->144, then 6+6)=12 ->156, then 6+7=13 ->169, then 9+8=17 ->186\n            Total ~186 -> average = 186/24 = 7.75\n\n        Day4:\n            11.407,13.361,11.513,12.508,11.691,11.407,11.051,11.620,10.270,6.858,6.396,6.432,4.371,5.295,5.934,5.401,5.970,6.041,5.792,5.259,5.188,4.548,4.335,7.285\n            Night: 11.407+13.361+11.513+12.508+11.691+7.285 = 67.765\n            Day: the rest: 11.407+11.051+11.620+10.270+6.858+6.396+6.432+4.371+5.295+5.934+5.401+5.970+6.041+5.792+5.259+5.188+4.548+4.335\n            Let me add: \n            11.407+11.051=22.458; +11.620=34.078; +10.270=44.348; +6.858=51.206; +6.396=57.602; +6.432=64.034; +4.371=68.405; +5.295=73.7; +5.934=79.634; +5.401=85.035; +5.970=91.005; +6.041=97.046; +5.792=102.838; +5.259=108.097; +5.188=113.285; +4.548=117.833; +4.335=122.168\n            Total = 67.765 + 122.168 = 189.933 -> average = 7.913\n\n        The daily averages: [7.754, 8.3167, 7.75, 7.913] -> no clear trend. So we can use the overall average of these 4 days: (7.754+8.3167+7.75+7.913)/4 = 7.933\n\n   Step 2: For each hour, compute the seasonal index as the average of (value at that hour / daily average of the day) for the 4 days.\n\n        Example for hour 00:00:\n            Day1: 10.767 / 7.754 = 1.3888\n            Day2: 11.194 / 8.3167 = 1.346\n            Day3: 9.879 / 7.75 = 1.2747\n            Day4: 11.407 / 7.913 = 1.441\n            Average index = (1.3888+1.346+1.2747+1.441)/4 = 1.3626\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days at 00:00 would be: 1.3626 * 7.933 (the overall average) = 10.81\n\n   But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we can also use the daily average for the next day? We don't have a daily average for the future. So we can use the overall average (7.933) for each day? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days? But that would be the same for each day? \n\n   Since we don't have a trend, we can use the overall average (7.933) for the daily level for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   Then the forecast for hour h (0 to 23) on any of the next 4 days is: \n        forecast_h = (average index for hour h) * 7.933\n\n   But note: the daily average of the forecasted day would then be 7.933, which is the overall average.\n\n   However, we can also use a moving daily average? But we don't have a trend.\n\n   This method is simple and might capture the seasonality.\n\n   But note: the data has a pattern that the night values are higher and day values are lower. This method will capture that.\n\n   How to compute for all 96 points? We need to compute the index for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that index for the 4 days.\n\n   Steps for the forecast:\n\n        Let S_h = ( (value of hour h on day1)/avg1 + (value of hour h on day2)/avg2 + (value of hour h on day3)/avg3 + (value of hour h on day4)/avg4 ) / 4\n\n        Then forecast for hour h on any of the next 4 days = S_h * (overall average of the 4 days) \n        where overall average = (avg1+avg2+avg3+avg4)/4 = 7.933\n\n   We have to compute S_h for h=0,1,...,23.\n\n   But note: we don't have the exact daily averages? We approximated. We should use the exact.\n\n   However, we are not coding and we have to do it manually for 24 hours? That's tedious.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall average? \n\n        Let A_h = (value1_h + value2_h + value3_h + value4_h) / 4   [this is the average for hour h]\n\n        Then the overall average of the entire 96 points is: (sum of all 96 points)/96 = (7.754*24 + 8.3167*24 + 7.75*24 + 7.913*24)/96 = (7.754+8.3167+7.75+7.933)/4? \n        Actually, the total sum = 7.754*24 + 8.3167*24 + 7.75*24 + 7.913*24 = 24)*(7.754+8.3167+7.75+7.913) = 24 * 31.7337 = 761.6088\n        Then overall average = 761.6088 / 96 = 7.933\n\n        Now, if we take the average for hour h: A_h, then the seasonal index for that hour is: A_h / (overall average) \n        because: overall average = (sum_{h} A_h) / 24? \n        Actually, the average of the 96 points is also the average of the 24 hourly averages? \n        Because: (sum_{d} sum_{h} x_{d,h}) = 96 * overall_avg\n        And also: (sum_{h} (4 * A_h)) = 4 * (sum_{h} A_h) = 96 * overall_avg -> so sum_{h} A_h = 24 * overall_avg.\n\n        Therefore, the average of the 24 A_h's is overall_avg.\n\n        So we can compute the forecast for hour h as: A_h (because we are going to use the same average for each of the next 4 days) and that would be the same as the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Why? Because if we use the same pattern for each day, then the forecast for hour h on day5 is A_h, on day6 is A_h, etc.\n\n        But note: A_h is the average of the 4 observations at hour h. So we are essentially using the average of the same hour over the 4 days as the forecast for that hour in each of the next 4 days.\n\n        This is equivalent to the first simple method I mentioned.\n\n   Therefore, we can simply:\n\n        For the next 96 hours (which are 4 days, each day 24 hours), we repeat the 24-hour average pattern (computed as the average of the same hour over the 4 days) for 4 times.\n\n   How to compute the 24 averages?\n\n        We have 4 days of data for each hour. We average the 4 values for each hour.\n\n        Example for hour 00:00: (10.767 + 11.194 + 9.879 + 11.407) / 4 = 10.81175\n        Then for the next 4 days at 00:00, we use 10.81175.\n\n        Similarly for hour 01:00: (10.305+12.295+10.447+13.361)/4 = (10.305+12.295=22.6; +10.447=33.047; +13.361=46.408) -> 46.408/4=11.602\n\n        And so on for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days is the 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n   Let's do the calculation for the 24 hours:\n\n        We'll create a list for the 24 hours (0 to 23) by averaging the 4 days.\n\n        Hour0 (00:00): [10.767, 11.194, 9.879, 11.407] -> (10.767+11.194+9.879+11.407)/4 = 43.247/4 = 10.81175\n        Hour1: [10.305, 12.295, 10.447, 13.361] -> (10.305+12.295+10.447+13.361)=46.408 -> 11.602\n        Hour2: [9.417,13.006,10.412,11.513] -> 9.417+13.006=22.423; +10.412=32.835; +11.513=44.348 -> 44.348/4=11.087\n        Hour3: [9.097,12.402,9.594,12.508] -> 9.097+12.402=21.499; +9.594=31.093; +12.508=43.601 -> 10.90025\n        Hour4: [8.493,12.402,7.249,11.691] -> 8.493+12.402=20.895; +7.249=28.144; +11.691=39.835 -> 9.95875\n        Hour5: [6.858,11.087,9.666,11.407] -> 6.858+11.087=17.945; +9.666=27.611; +11.407=39.018 -> 9.7545\n        Hour6: [7.391,10.803,7.782,11.051] -> 7.391+10.803=18.194; +7.782=25.976; +11.051=37.027 -> 9.25675\n        Hour7: [9.204,12.011,7.604,11.620] -> 9.204+12.011=21.215; +7.604=28.819; +11.620=40.439 -> 10.10975\n        Hour8: [9.879,11.869,8.813,10.270] -> 9.879+11.869=21.748; +8.813=30.561; +10.270=40.831 -> 10.20775\n        Hour9: [6.858,7.711,8.884,6.858] -> 6.858+7.711=14.569; +8.884=23.453; +6.858=30.311 -> 7.57775\n        Hour10: [6.681,6.716,6.716,6.396] -> 6.681+6.716=13.397; +6.716=20.113; +6.396=26.509 -> 6.62725\n        Hour11: [7.782,6.858,7.143,6.432] -> 7.782+6.858=14.64; +7.143=21.783; +6.432=28.215 -> 7.05375\n        Hour12: [4.797,4.868,4.371,4.371] -> 4.797+4.868=9.665; +4.371=14.036; +4.371=18.407 -> 4.60175\n        Hour13: [6.148,5.757,5.224,5.295] -> 6.148+5.757=11.905; +5.224=17.129; +5.295=22.424 -> 5.606\n        Hour14: [6.823,5.721,5.828,5.934] -> 6.823+5.721=12.544; +5.828=18.372; +5.934=24.306 -> 6.0765\n        Hour15: [6.929,5.615,6.325,5.401] -> 6.929+5.615=12.544; +6.325=18.869; +5.401=24.27 -> 6.0675\n        Hour16: [6.396,6.076,6.325,5.970] -> 6.396+6.076=12.472; +6.325=18.797; +5.970=24.767 -> 6.19175\n        Hour17: [6.752,6.219,6.076,6.041] -> 6.752+6.219=12.971; +6.076=19.047; +6.041=25.088 -> 6.272\n        Hour18: [6.041,5.970,6.148,5.792] -> 6.041+5.970=12.011; +6.148=18.159; +5.792=23.951 -> 5.98775\n        Hour19: [6.219,5.970,6.396,5.259] -> 6.219+5.970=12.189; +6.396=18.585; +5.259=23.844 -> 5.961\n        Hour20: [5.792,5.401,5.508,5.188] -> 5.792+5.401=11.193; +5.508=16.701; +5.188=21.889 -> 5.47225\n        Hour21: [7.071,4.868,6.716,4.548] -> 7.071+4.868=11.939; +6.716=18.655; +4.548=23.203 -> 5.80075\n        Hour22: [8.599,6.716,8.884,4.335] -> 8.599+6.716=15.315; +8.884=24.199; +4.335=28.534 -> 7.1335\n        Hour23: [10.803,8.066,8.422,7.285] -> 10.803+8.066=18.869; +8.422=27.291; +7.285=34.576 -> 8.644\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day5 (2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-20 23:00:00): \n            00:00: 10.81175\n            01:00: 11.602\n            02:00: 11.087\n            03:00: 10.90025\n            04:00: 9.95875\n            05:00: 9.7545\n            06:00: 9.25675\n            07:00: 10.10975\n            08:00: 10.20775\n            09:00: 7.57775\n            10:00: 6.62725\n            11:00: 7.05375\n            12:00: 4.60175\n            13:00: 5.606\n            14:00: 6.0765\n            15:00: 6.0675\n            16:00: 6.19175\n            17:00: 6.272\n            18:00: 5.98775\n            19:00: 5.961\n            20:00: 5.47225\n            21:00: 5.80075\n            22:00: 7.1335\n            23:00: 8.644\n\n        Then Day6 (2016-12-21) to Day8 (2016-12-23) are the same 24 numbers repeated.\n\n   But note: the dates must be generated.

The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the example input had two columns: date and MUFL.\n\n   We'll output two columns: the date string and the value (with 3 decimal places).\n\n   We'll use the same format as the input: the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the value as a float with 3 decimals.\n\n   Let me generate the entire 96 rows.\n\n   We have the 24 values for one day (as above) and we repeat them 4 times.\n\n   We'll list the 24 values for one day (rounded to 3 decimals) as:\n\n        [10.812, 11.602, 11.087, 10.900, 9.959, 9.755, 9.257, 10.110, 10.208, 7.578, 6.627, 7.054, 4.602, 5.606, 6.077, 6.068, 6.192, 6.272, 5.988, 5.961, 5.472, 5.801, 7.134, 8.644]\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast period (2016-12-20 to 2016-12-23) we assign these 24 values.\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-12-20\n        Day2: 2016-12-21\n        Day3: 2016-12-22\n        Day4: 2016-12-23\n\n   For each day, we generate 24 hours: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n   We write the data.\n\n   Note: We must not omit any content.\n\n   Let's write the full 96 lines.\n\n   We'll do it in the answer block.\n",
