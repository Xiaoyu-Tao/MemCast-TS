        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (4 days) of Middle UseFul Load (MUFL) from 2017-07-28 00:00:00 to 2017-07-31 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). However, the last day (2017-07-31) is constant (14.356) which is an anomaly.\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 records does not have missing values?).\n 3. Since the last day is constant, we must consider that this might be an error or a special condition. However, for forecasting, we cannot simply extend the constant.\n\n Approach:\n - We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data, we have a seasonality of 24.\n - We can use models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality. However, the constant on the last day might distort the model.\n - Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: take the average of the previous days (excluding the last day which is constant) and use that pattern for the next days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided past data does not. So we are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n Considering the anomaly on 2017-07-31, we see that the data from 2017-07-28 to 2017-07-30 are varying, but 2017-07-31 is constant. \n This constant value might be an error or a special condition (like the transformer was taken offline). However, without more context, we have to make a decision.\n\n Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided past 96 are complete, we assume that the next 96 might have missing values? \n But the instruction says: \"forecast the data for next 96 recorded dates\" and \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\".\n\n We are to produce 96 forecasted values without missing values.\n\n How to handle the constant day?\n  Option 1: Treat the constant day as missing and impute it with the pattern of the previous days? But we are not asked to impute the past, only to forecast the future.\n  Option 2: We build a model that is robust to such anomalies? \n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days (with one day being constant) we might do:\n\n  - Use the first three days (2017-07-28, 2017-07-29, 2017-07-30) to form a daily pattern and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours) but adjusted by the overall level?\n\n  However, note that the problem does not specify the model. We are experts, so we choose a reasonable method.\n\n  Steps for forecasting:\n   1. Remove the last day (2017-07-31) because it is constant and likely an anomaly. Then we have 72 hours (3 days) of data.\n   2. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 3 days to form a daily profile.\n   3. Then we use that daily profile for the next 4 days (since 4 days * 24 = 96 hours).\n\n  But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We only have 3 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality. We assume daily seasonality.\n\n  How to form the daily profile?\n   - For hour 0: average of [2017-07-28 00:00:00, 2017-07-29 00:00:00, 2017-07-30 00:00:00] -> (13.930 + 13.290 + 14.321)/3\n   - Similarly for each hour.\n\n  However, we note that the data on 2017-07-30 has some unusual values (e.g., at 15:00:00 jumps to 3.092, which is positive while the previous days at that hour are negative). \n  This might be due to a different load pattern on Sunday? But 2017-07-28 is Friday, 2017-07-29 Saturday, 2017-07-30 Sunday, and 2017-07-31 Monday? \n\n  But we are forecasting for the next 4 days: 2017-08-01 (Tuesday) to 2017-08-04 (Friday). So we have a mix of weekdays.\n\n  Without more data, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we will use the average of the three days we have for each hour.\n\n  But note: the three days are Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The next four days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? \n  Actually, 2017-07-31 is Monday, so the next day is Tuesday, August 1.\n\n  We don't have Monday data (because the Monday we have is constant and we are excluding it). So we have to rely on the three days we have.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the entire 4 days? But the last day is constant and might be an error. \n\n  Let's check: the constant value 14.356 is the same as the value at 2017-07-28 20:00:00 and other times. But it is constant for 24 hours. This is not typical.\n\n  We decide to use the first three days to form the daily profile.\n\n  Steps:\n   - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean of the three days.\n\n  However, the data for the three days are:\n\n        Hour 0: [13.930, 13.290, 14.321] -> mean = (13.930+13.290+14.321)/3 = 13.847\n        Hour 1: [13.468, 14.214, 14.925] -> (13.468+14.214+14.925)/3 = 14.2023\n\n   and so on.\n\n  Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days (96 hours) starting from 2017-08-01 00:00:00.\n\n  But note: the pattern we are using is an average of Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The next days are Tuesday to Friday. \n  might be different. However, without more data, this is the best we can do.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last three days (2017-07-29, 2017-07-30, and 2017-07-31) but the last day is constant. \n  If we include the constant day, then the average for each hour would be:\n\n        Hour 0: (13.290 + 14.321 + 14.356)/3 = 13.989\n        ... and so on.\n\n  But the constant day might be an error. We have to decide.\n\n  Let me look at the data: the constant value 14.356 appears in the previous days at peak times (e.g., 20:00) but not all day. \n  It is unusual to have a constant for 24 hours. Therefore, we decide to exclude 2017-07-31.\n\n  So we use the first three days (July 28, 29, 30) to form the daily profile.\n\n  We calculate the mean for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (13.930 + 13.290 + 14.321) / 3 = 13.847\n        hour1: (13.468 + 14.214 + 14.925) / 3 = 14.202333\n        hour2: (12.331 + 11.655 + 14.107) / 3 = 12.6976667\n        hour3: (12.046 + 11.478 + 13.574) / 3 = 12.366\n        hour4: (10.732 + 11.371 + 12.082) / 3 = 11.395\n        hour5: (9.417 + 10.412 + 12.366) / 3 = 10.7316667\n        hour6: (8.671 + 7.889 + 9.985) / 3 = 8.8483333\n        hour7: (5.721 + 5.366 + 7.356) / 3 = 6.1476667\n        hour8: (0.213 + 0.036 + 0.000) / 3 = 0.083\n        hour9: (-4.158 + -4.442 + -6.112) / 3 = -4.904\n        hour10: (-6.254 + -7.569 + -4.406) / 3 = -6.0763333\n        hour11: (-8.138 + -10.056 + -6.716) / 3 = -8.3033333\n        hour12: (-8.742 + -7.747 + -12.935) / 3 = -9.808\n        hour13: (-7.356 + -8.564 + -11.158) / 3 = -9.026\n        hour14: (-5.650 + -6.538 + -7.107) / 3 = -6.4316667\n        hour15: (-3.447 + -4.584 + 3.092) / 3 = -1.6463333   [Note: the third day has a positive value at 15:00]\n        hour16: (-0.888 + -1.031 + -0.249) / 3 = -0.7226667\n        hour17: (3.447 + 2.203 + 4.264) / 3 = 3.3046667\n        hour18: (7.427 + 6.716 + 5.721) / 3 = 6.6213333\n        hour19: (10.376 + 8.884 + 6.361) / 3 = 8.5403333\n        hour20: (14.356 + 12.864 + 10.305) / 3 = 12.5083333\n        hour21: (13.752 + 14.818 + 12.117) / 3 = 13.5623333\n        hour22: (13.788 + 14.321 + 12.295) / 3 = 13.468\n        hour23: (12.544 + 13.432 + 12.295) / 3 = 12.757\n\n  Then we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this daily pattern 4 times.\n\n  The dates start from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00.\n\n  We generate:\n\n        date                MUFL\n        2017-08-01 00:00:00 13.847\n        2017-08-01 01:00:00 14.202333\n        2017-08-01 02:00:00 12.6976667\n        ... and so on for the first 24 hours (day 1: Tuesday)\n        then repeat the same 24 numbers for 2017-08-02 (Wednesday), 2017-08-03 (Thursday), 2017-08-04 (Friday)\n\n  However, note: the pattern we averaged is from Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The next days are Tuesday to Friday. \n  There might be a weekly pattern. But we don't have enough data to capture that. So we use the same pattern for every day.\n\n  We must format the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  The input had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n  Let's compute the averages and round:\n\n        hour0: 13.847 -> 13.847\n        hour1: 14.202333 -> 14.202\n        hour2: 12.697667 -> 12.698\n        hour3: 12.366 -> 12.366\n        hour4: 11.395 -> 11.395\n        hour5: 10.731667 -> 10.732\n        hour6: 8.848333 -> 8.848\n        hour7: 6.147667 -> 6.148\n        hour8: 0.083 -> 0.083\n        hour9: -4.904 -> -4.904\n        hour10: -6.076333 -> -6.076\n        hour11: -8.303333 -> -8.303\n        hour12: -9.808 -> -9.808\n        hour13: -9.026 -> -9.026\n        hour14: -6.431667 -> -6.432\n        hour15: -1.646333 -> -1.646\n        hour16: -0.722667 -> -0.723\n        hour17: 3.304667 -> 3.305\n        hour18: 6.621333 -> 6.621\n        hour19: 8.540333 -> 8.540\n        hour20: 12.508333 -> 12.508\n        hour21: 13.562333 -> 13.562\n        hour22: 13.468 -> 13.468\n        hour23: 12.757 -> 12.757\n\n  Then we repeat this 4 times.\n\n  But note: the last day of the provided data is 2017-07-31 23:00:00. The next day is 2017-08-01 00:00:00.\n\n  We generate 96 records.\n\n  We must output in the same format.\n\n  Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n               date    MUFL\n2017-08-01 00:00:00  13.847\n2017-08-01 01:00:00  14.202\n2017-08-01 02:00:00  12.698\n... \n```\n\n  We'll generate the dates using pandas or manually? We can do:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-01 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-01 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-01 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-02 00:00:00 ... until 2017-08-04 23:00:00.\n\n  We have 4 days.\n\n  We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n  We are not given any missing values in the provided past data, so we assume the forecast is complete.\n\n  Let's generate the data.\n\n  We'll create a list of the 24 hourly averages (rounded to 3 decimals) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n  The list for one day:\n\n        [13.847, 14.202, 12.698, 12.366, 11.395, 10.732, 8.848, 6.148, 0.083, -4.904, -6.076, -8.303, -9.808, -9.026, -6.432, -1.646, -0.723, 3.305, 6.621, 8.540, 12.508, 13.562, 13.468, 12.757]\n\n  Then for 4 days.\n\n  We must be cautious: the rounding. We did:\n\n        hour0: (13.930+13.290+14.321)=41.541 -> 41.541/3=13.847 -> 13.847 (so we keep 3 decimals as is)\n        hour1: (13.468+14.214+14.925)=42.607 -> 42.607/3=14.202333... -> rounded to 3 decimals: 14.202\n\n  We'll do the same for all.\n\n  Now, we write the data.\n\n  Note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n  We start at 2017-08-01 00:00:00 and go to 2017-08-04 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll generate:\n\n        day1: 2017-08-01\n        day2: 2017-08-02\n        day3: 2017-08-03\n        day4: 2017-08-04\n\n  We output 96 lines.\n\n  Let's do it.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n  We are providing 96 records.\n\n  We write the answer in the required format.\n\n  Important: The format must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n               date    MUFL\n2017-08-01 00:00:00  13.847\n2017-08-01 01:00:00  14.202\n...\n```\n\n  We note that the original data had the index as the date string without the index column. So we output two columns: 'date' and 'MUFL'.\n\n  We'll generate the dates as strings.\n\n  Code for generating the dates:\n\n        base = datetime(2017, 1, 1) # but we know the start date: 2017-08-01\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n        dates = []\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 8, 1)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                current = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                dates.append(current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n  But we are writing by hand? We can do:\n\n        We know the pattern: \n          2017-08-01 00:00:00, 2017-08-01 01:00:00, ... 2017-08-01 23:00:00\n          2017-08-02 00:00:00 ... \n\n  We'll write a list of dates and then the MUFL value.\n\n  We have the MUFL values for one day in a list called `daily_pattern`.\n\n  Then we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n  We'll write the output.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
