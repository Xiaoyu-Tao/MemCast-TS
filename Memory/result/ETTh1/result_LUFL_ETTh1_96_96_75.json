        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might have missing values. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we can use the given 96 points as a complete series.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data shows a daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models, but we can use a simple statistical method such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day (or the last available same hour in the training data).\n   - However, note that the last day (2017-04-30) has some unusual low values in the afternoon (e.g., 1.036, 1.005, 0.853) which might be an anomaly? But we have to use the pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Since the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we can proceed.\n\n However, note that the data from 2017-04-30 is a Sunday? (We don't have the day of week, but we can assume the pattern might be weekly? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality). Therefore, we stick to daily seasonality.\n\n Let's try to use a seasonal naive method for the next 24 hours (using the same hour from the previous day) and then for the next 96 hours we can use the same pattern from the last 4 days? But note: we are forecasting 4 days ahead.\n\n We can do:\n   - For the first 24 hours (2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-01 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-04-30 (the last day) as a naive forecast? \n   - But the pattern might be different because 2017-04-30 is a Sunday and 2017-05-01 is a Monday? We don't have information about the day of the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days? But note that the 4 days ago (2017-04-27) was a Thursday? and 2017-04-28 Friday, 2017-04-29 Saturday, 2017-04-30 Sunday. Then 2017-05-01 is Monday. We don't have a Monday in the past to refer to.\n\n Given the limited data, we can do:\n   Option 1: Use the last day (Sunday) for the forecast of Monday? But that might not be accurate because weekdays and weekends have different patterns? But we don't have enough data to see the weekly pattern.\n\n   Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? This might smooth out the pattern and capture the daily cycle.\n\n However, note that the data on 2017-04-30 (Sunday) has a dip in the afternoon (from 1 PM to 4 PM) that is not present in the previous days. This might be a weekend effect? Then for Monday (2017-05-01) we might expect a pattern more like the weekdays (2017-04-27, 2017-04-28) and not the weekend (2017-04-29 and 2017-04-30). But we don't have enough data to be sure.\n\n Since we are forced to make a forecast, we will use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days. This is a simple but reasonable approach.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days (from day1 to day4), we compute:\n        forecast_h = (value_h from day1_ago + value_h from day2_ago + value_h from day3_ago + value_h from day4_ago) / 4\n\n But note: our last day in the training is 2017-04-30 (day0). Then:\n   For 2017-05-01 (day1): \n        hour0: average of 2017-04-27 00:00, 2017-04-28 00:00, 2017-04-29 00:00, 2017-04-30 00:00\n        hour1: average of 2017-04-27 01:00, ... and so on.\n\n   Similarly, for 2017-05-02 (day2): we would use the same set of averages? But note: we are forecasting 4 days, and we don't have any data. So we have to use the same 4 days for each of the next 4 days? That would make the forecast for each day identical? That is not capture the day-of-week effect.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a rolling window? But we don't have more data.\n\n Since we don't have any information about the next days being weekdays or weekends, and we only have 4 days (which include both weekdays and weekend), we can use the same average for each day. This will give a constant daily pattern.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4-day window. We are not using the entire history because we are only given 96 points.\n\n Therefore, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Let's compute the averages:\n\n   Hour 0: (2.071 + 5.300 + 2.193 + 1.828) / 4 = (2.071+5.300=7.371; 7.371+2.193=9.564; 9.564+1.828=11.392) -> 11.392/4 = 2.848\n   Hour 1: (1.553 + 4.752 + 2.406 + 1.919) / 4 = (1.553+4.752=6.305; 6.305+2.406=8.711; 8.711+1.919=10.63) -> 10.63/4 = 2.6575\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for 2017-04-30 has a dip in the afternoon. If we average, that dip will be included and might lower the forecast for the afternoon of the next days. Since we are forecasting for the next 4 days (Monday to Thursday) and we don't know if they are weekdays or weekends? Actually, 2017-05-01 is Monday, 2017-05-02 Tuesday, 2017-05-03 Wednesday, 2017-05-04 Thursday. So they are weekdays. \n\n We have only one weekday (2017-04-27 and 2017-04-28) and two weekend days (2017-04-29 and 2017-04-30). Therefore, we might want to weight the weekdays more? But we don't have enough data to do that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use only the two weekdays? But then we only have two days and we are forecasting 4 days? That might be too little.\n\n Given the constraints, we stick to the average of the last 4 days.\n\n We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) and then repeat that same daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   - Create an array of 24 values, each being the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n   - Then for the next 4 days, we use that array for each day.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (2.071 + 5.300 + 2.193 + 1.828) / 4 = 2.392 / 4? Wait: 2.071+5.300=7.371; 7.371+2.193=9.564; 9.564+1.828=11.392 -> 11.392/4 = 2.848\n   Hour 1: (1.553+4.752+2.406+1.919) = 1.553+4.752=6.305; 6.305+2.406=8.711; 8.711+1.919=10.63 -> 10.63/4 = 2.6575\n   Hour 2: (1.828+4.630+1.767+1.980) = 1.828+4.630=6.458; 6.458+1.767=8.225; 8.225+1.980=10.205 -> 10.205/4 = 2.55125\n   Hour 3: (1.614+4.508+1.492+1.828) = 1.614+4.508=6.122; 6.122+1.492=7.614; 7.614+1.828=9.442 -> 9.442/4 = 2.3605\n   Hour 4: (1.523+4.660+1.858+2.071) = 1.523+4.660=6.183; 6.183+1.858=8.041; 8.041+2.071=10.112 -> 10.112/4 = 2.528\n   Hour 5: (2.041+3.046+2.376+2.650) = 2.041+3.046=5.087; 5.087+2.376=7.463; 7.463+2.650=10.113 -> 10.113/4 = 2.52825\n   Hour 6: (2.711+3.655+3.046+3.259) = 2.711+3.655=6.366; 6.366+3.046=9.412; 9.412+3.259=12.671 -> 12.671/4 = 3.16775\n   Hour 7: (2.924+2.985+2.772+2.924) = 2.924+2.985=5.909; 5.909+2.772=8.681; 8.681+2.924=11.605 -> 11.605/4 = 2.90125\n   Hour 8: (2.650+2.619+2.863+3.076) = 2.650+2.619=5.269; 5.269+2.863=8.132; 8.132+3.076=11.208 -> 11.208/4 = 2.802\n   Hour 9: (2.711+2.772+2.924+3.168) = 2.711+2.772=5.483; 5.483+2.924=8.407; 8.407+3.168=11.575 -> 11.575/4 = 2.89375\n   Hour 10: (2.955+2.955+3.381+3.076) = 2.955+2.955=5.91; 5.91+3.381=9.291; 9.291+3.076=12.367 -> 12.367/4 = 3.09175\n   Hour 11: (2.894+2.985+3.107+3.015) = 2.894+2.985=5.879; 5.879+3.107=8.986; 8.986+3.015=12.001 -> 12.001/4 = 3.00025\n   Hour 12: (2.437+2.132+2.345+2.315) = 2.437+2.132=4.569; 4.569+2.345=6.914; 6.914+2.315=9.229 -> 9.229/4 = 2.30725\n   Hour 13: (2.772+2.589+2.467+1.036) = 2.772+2.589=5.361; 5.361+2.467=7.828; 7.828+1.036=8.864 -> 8.864/4 = 2.216\n   Hour 14: (2.498+2.132+2.376+1.005) = 2.498+2.132=4.63; 4.63+2.376=7.006; 7.006+1.005=8.011 -> 8.011/4 = 2.00275\n   Hour 15: (2.589+2.041+2.437+0.853) = 2.589+2.041=4.63; 4.63+2.437=7.067; 7.067+0.853=7.92 -> 7.92/4 = 1.98\n   Hour 16: (2.741+2.284+2.376+1.401) = 2.741+2.284=5.025; 5.025+2.376=7.401; 7.401+1.401=8.802 -> 8.802/4 = 2.2005\n   Hour 17: (2.741+2.711+2.772+2.071) = 2.741+2.711=5.452; 5.452+2.772=8.224; 8.224+2.071=10.295 -> 10.295/4 = 2.57375\n   Hour 18: (2.772+2.985+2.924+2.132) = 2.772+2.985=5.757; 5.757+2.924=8.681; 8.681+2.132=10.813 -> 10.813/4 = 2.70325\n   Hour 19: (2.863+2.619+2.559+2.741) = 2.863+2.619=5.482; 5.482+2.559=8.041; 8.041+2.741=10.782 -> 10.782/4 = 2.6955\n   Hour 20: (2.863+2.985+2.741+2.680) = 2.863+2.985=5.848; 5.848+2.741=8.589; 8.589+2.680=11.269 -> 11.269/4 = 2.81725\n   Hour 21: (2.955+2.955+2.467+2.437) = 2.955+2.955=5.91; 5.91+2.467=8.377; 8.377+2.437=10.814 -> 10.814/4 = 2.7035\n   Hour 22: (2.802+2.833+2.041+2.163) = 2.802+2.833=5.635; 5.635+2.041=7.676; 7.676+2.163=9.839 -> 9.839/4 = 2.45975\n   Hour 23: (2.376+2.467+2.132+2.071) = 2.376+2.467=4.843; 4.843+2.132=6.975; 6.975+2.071=9.046 -> 9.046/4 = 2.2615\n\n Now, we have 24 values.

We are to forecast the next 96 without missing? So we output the 96 values.\n\n However, we must note that the actual future might have different patterns (like weekdays vs weekends) but we don't have the information to account for that.\n\n We output the data in the same format: date and LUFL.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-05-01 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-05-01 01:00:00 ... until 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n\n We'll write the data with the same precision (3 decimal places) as the input.\n\n However, note: the input has 3 decimal places, but our computed values have more. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n   Hour0: 2.848 -> 2.848\n   Hour1: 2.6575 -> 2.658 (rounded to 3 decimals: 2.658)\n   Hour2: 2.55125 -> 2.551\n   Hour3: 2.3605 -> 2.361\n   Hour4: 2.528 -> 2.528\n   Hour5: 2.52825 -> 2.528\n   Hour6: 3.16775 -> 3.168\n   Hour7: 2.90125 -> 2.901\n   Hour8: 2.802 -> 2.802\n   Hour9: 2.89375 -> 2.894\n   Hour10: 3.09175 -> 3.092\n   Hour11: 3.00025 -> 3.000\n   Hour12: 2.30725 -> 2.307\n   Hour13: 2.216 -> 2.216\n   Hour14: 2.00275 -> 2.003\n   Hour15: 1.98 -> 1.980 (we write as 1.980 to have 3 decimals)\n   But note: 1.98 is 1.980? So we can write 1.980.\n\n   However, let's check: \n        Hour15: 1.98 -> we computed 1.98, which is 1.980? But the input has 0.853 (three decimals). So we write 1.980? Actually, 1.98 is the same as 1.980? We can write with 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll format all to 3 decimals.\n\n   Let me recompute the rounding:\n\n        Hour0: 2.848 -> 2.848\n        Hour1: 2.6575 -> 2.658 (because 2.6575 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 7 becomes 8 -> 2.658)\n        Hour2: 2.55125 -> 2.551 (because 2.55125: 4th decimal is 2 -> round down -> 2.551)\n        Hour3: 2.3605 -> 2.361 (because 2.3605: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 0 to 1 -> 2.361)\n        Hour4: 2.528 -> 2.528\n        Hour5: 2.52825 -> 2.528 (because 2.52825: 4th decimal is 2 -> round down -> 2.528)\n        Hour6: 3.16775 -> 3.168 (because 3.16775: 4th decimal is 7 -> round up the 7 to 8 -> 3.168)\n        Hour7: 2.90125 -> 2.901 (because 2.90125: 4th decimal is 2 -> round down -> 2.901)\n        Hour8: 2.802 -> 2.802\n        Hour9: 2.89375 -> 2.894 (because 2.89375: 4th decimal is 7 -> round up the 3 to 4 -> 2.894)\n        Hour10: 3.09175 -> 3.092 (because 3.09175: 4th decimal is 7 -> round up the 1 to 2 -> 3.092)\n        Hour11: 3.00025 -> 3.000 (because 3.00025: 4th decimal is 2 -> round down -> 3.000)\n        Hour12: 2.30725 -> 2.307\n        Hour13: 2.216 -> 2.216\n        Hour14: 2.00275 -> 2.003 (because 2.00275: 4th decimal is 7 -> round up the 2 to 3 -> 2.003)\n        Hour15: 1.98 -> 1.980 (but wait, we computed 1.98?

But in practice, we round up. So 2.6955 rounded to 3 decimals: \n            Look at the 4th decimal: 5, then we round up the third decimal (5) to 6 -> 2.696.\n\n        However, note: 2.6955 is exactly halfway? But the common practice is to round up. So 2.696.\n\n        Hour20: 2.81725 -> 2.817 (because 2.81725: 4th decimal is 2 -> round down -> 2.817)\n        Hour21: 2.7035 -> 2.704 (because 2.7035: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3 to 4 -> 2.704)\n        Hour22: 2.45975 -> 2.460 (because 2.45975: 4th decimal is 7 -> round up the 9 to 10 -> so 2.460? Actually, 2.45975: \n            The third decimal is 9, and we round up: 9+1=10 -> so we get 2.460)\n        Hour23: 2.2615 -> 2.262 (because 2.2615: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 1 to 2 -> 2.262)\n\n But wait, for hour22: 2.45975 -> \n        The number: 2.45975\n        We want 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal: 7 -> which is >=5, so we round up the third decimal (9) by 1 -> 9+1=10 -> so we have to carry over: \n        2.459 -> rounding up: 2.460.\n\n So the 24 values for one day (rounded to 3 decimals) are:\n\n  0: 2.848\n  1: 2.658\n  2: 2.551\n  3: 2.361\n  4: 2.528\n  5: 2.528\n  6: 3.168\n  7: 2.901\n  8: 2.802\n  9: 2.894\n  10: 3.092\n  11: 3.000\n  12: 2.307\n  13: 2.216\n  14: 2.003\n  15: 1.980\n  16: 2.201\n  17: 2.574\n  18: 2.703\n  19: 2.696\n  20: 2.817\n  21: 2.704\n  22: 2.460\n  23: 2.262\n\n Now, we'll write the next 4 days with these values.\n\n Format: \n        date (as string) and LUFL (as float rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n We generate the dates:\n\n  2017-05-01 00:00:00\n  2017-05-01 01:00:00\n  ... until\n  2017-05-01 23:00:00\n\n  2017-05-02 00:00:00\n  ... until\n  2017-05-04 23:00:00\n\n We output in the same format as the input.\n\n We must output 96 lines.\n\n Let's write the data in the required format.\n\n Note: The input had the date in the format: \"2017-04-27 00:00:00\"\n\n We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-01 00:00:00 2.848\n2017-05-01 01:00:00 2.658\n2017-05-01 02:00:00 2.551\n2017-05-01 03:00:00 2.361\n2017-05-01 04:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-01 05:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-01 06:00:00 3.168\n2017-05-01 07:00:00 2.901\n2017-05-01 08:00:00 2.802\n2017-05-01 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-05-01 10:00:00 3.092\n2017-05-01 11:00:00 3.000\n2017-05-01 12:00:00 2.307\n2017-05-01 13:00:00 2.216\n2017-05-01 14:00:00 2.003\n2017-05-01 15:00:00 1.980\n2017-05-01 16:00:00 2.201\n2017-05-01 17:00:00 2.574\n2017-05-01 18:00:00 2.703\n2017-05-01 19:00:00 2.696\n2017-05-01 20:00:00 2.817\n2017-05-01 21:00:00 2.704\n2017-05-01 22:00:00 2.460\n2017-05-01 23:00:00 2.262\n2017-05-02 00:00:00 2.848\n2017-05-02 01:00:00 2.658\n2017-05-02 02:00:00 2.551\n2017-05-02 03:00:00 2.361\n2017-05-02 04:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-02 05:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-02 06:00:00 3.168\n2017-05-02 07:00:00 2.901\n2017-05-02 08:00:00 2.802\n2017-05-02 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-05-02 10:00:00 3.092\n2017-05-02 11:00:00 3.000\n2017-05-02 12:00:00 2.307\n2017-05-02 13:00:00 2.216\n2017-05-02 14:00:00 2.003\n2017-05-02 15:00:00 1.980\n2017-05-02 16:00:00 2.201\n2017-05-02 17:00:00 2.574\n2017-05-02 18:00:00 2.703\n2017-05-02 19:00:00 2.696\n2017-05-02 20:00:00 2.817\n2017-05-02 21:00:00 2.704\n2017-05-02 22:00:00 2.460\n2017-05-02 23:00:00 2.262\n2017-05-03 00:00:00 2.848\n2017-05-03 01:00:00 2.658\n2017-05-03 02:00:00 2.551\n2017-05-03 03:00:00 2.361\n2017-05-03 04:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-03 05:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-03 06:00:00 3.168\n2017-05-03 07:00:00 2.901\n2017-05-03 08:00:00 2.802\n2017-05-03 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-05-03 10:00:00 3.092\n2017-05-03 11:00:00 3.000\n2017-05-03 12:00:00 2.307\n2017-05-03 13:00:00 2.216\n2017-05-03 14:00:00 2.003\n2017-05-03 15:00:00 1.980\n2017-05-03 16:00:00 2.201\n2017-05-03 17:00:00 2.574\n2017-05-03 18:00:00 2.703\n2017-05-03 19:00:00 2.696\n2017-05-03 20:00:00 2.817\n2017-05-03 21:00:00 2.704\n2017-05-03 22:00:00 2.460\n2017-05-03 23:00:00 2.262\n2017-05-04 00:00:00 2.848\n2017-05-04 01:00:00 2.658\n2017-05-04 02:00:00 2.551\n2017-05-04 03:00:00 2.361\n2017-05-04 04:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-04 05:00:00 2.528\n2017-05-04 06:00:00 3.168\n2017-05-04 07:00:00 2.901\n2017-05-04 08:00:00 2.802\n2017-05-04 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-05-04 10:00:00 3.092\n2017-05-04 11:00:00 3.000\n2017-05-04 12:00:00 2.307\n2017-05-04 13:00:00 2.216\n2017-05-04 14:00:00 2.003\n2017-05-04 15:00:00 1.980\n2017-05-04 16:00:00 2.201\n2017-05-04 17:00:00 2.574\n2017-05-04 18:00:00 2.703\n2017-05-04 19:00:00 2.696\n2017-05-04 20:00:00 2.817\n2017-05-04 21:00:00 2.704\n2017-05-04 22:00:00 2.460\n2017-05-04 23:00:00 2.262\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the input had the date as a string without quotes?
