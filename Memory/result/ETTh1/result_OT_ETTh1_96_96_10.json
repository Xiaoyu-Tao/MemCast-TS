        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The problem mentions that the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points do not have any missing values in the given sample.\n 3. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 time steps and the data is hourly, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps ahead.\n\n However, as an AI, I cannot run code in real-time, but I can use a pre-trained model or a standard method to generate a forecast.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use a simple method to generate a forecast that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (since we see a pattern repeating every 24 hours)\n   - A possible weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly.\n\n But note: we have only 4 days of data. So we can model the daily seasonality and a trend if any.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - The temperature seems to have a daily cycle: lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - The overall level might be increasing slightly? Let's check the min and max:\n\n        Day 1: min ~29.12, max ~35.60\n        Day 2: min ~28.28, max ~35.38\n        Day 3: min ~27.86, max ~35.38\n        Day 4: min ~29.19, max ~36.79\n\n   - There might be a slight upward trend? But not very strong.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can use a model that uses the average of the last 4 days for the same hour, and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n However, note that the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are none.\n\n But for forecasting, we are to generate 96 points without any missing values.\n\n Proposed method:\n   We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n   But we also note that there might be a trend? We can compute the daily average and see:\n\n        Day1: average = (31.23+31.37+...+29.69)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            We can see the values are mostly in the 30s, but we don't have to compute exactly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average to smooth and then project.\n\n   However, to be more accurate, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and then adjust by the average hourly profile.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require a sophisticated model. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n        For each hour h in [0,23]:\n            Let base_h = average of the temperature at hour h over the 4 days.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days, for each day d (0 to 3) and hour h, the forecast for day d, hour h is base_h.\n\n   However, this ignores any trend. Since we have only 4 days, and the trend is not strong, this might be acceptable.\n\n   But let's check the overall average per day:\n\n        Day1: 2016-08-10: \n            We can compute the mean: \n                sum = 31.23+31.37+31.44+31.30+30.32+31.37+30.95+31.02+32.50+32.36+32.92+33.34+33.34+33.83+34.75+35.60+35.10+33.56+32.43+31.73+31.16+30.39+30.11+29.69\n                = 31.23+31.37+31.44+31.30+30.32+31.37+30.95+31.02+32.50+32.36+32.92+33.34+33.34+33.83+34.75+35.60+35.10+33.56+32.43+31.73+31.16+30.39+30.11+29.69\n                = 760.08 / 24 = 31.67\n\n        Day2: 2016-08-11:\n            = 29.33+29.40+29.62+29.12+28.77+28.49+28.35+29.33+29.47+30.18+31.37+31.44+31.37+32.15+32.99+34.40+35.38+35.31+33.48+32.08+30.74+30.25+30.60+30.18\n            = 29.33+29.40+29.62+29.12+28.77+28.49+28.35+29.33+29.47+30.18+31.37+31.44+31.37+32.15+32.99+34.40+35.38+35.31+33.48+32.08+30.74+30.25+30.60+30.18\n            = 722.71 / 24 = 30.11\n\n        Day3: 2016-08-12:\n            = 30.53+30.04+29.62+28.98+28.77+28.28+27.86+29.83+29.90+30.53+30.53+31.02+31.02+31.80+33.84+33.42+35.38+34.40+33.77+31.94+31.59+31.38+31.51+31.23\n            = 30.53+30.04+29.62+28.98+28.77+28.28+27.86+29.83+29.90+30.53+30.53+31.02+31.02+31.80+33.84+33.42+35.38+34.40+33.77+31.94+31.59+31.38+31.51+31.23\n            = 722.18 / 24 = 30.09\n\n        Day4: 2016-08-13:\n            = 31.51+30.74+30.74+30.60+29.97+29.55+29.19+30.67+30.81+31.23+32.64+32.43+32.29+33.34+34.89+35.81+36.65+36.79+35.46+33.77+33.06+32.64+32.50+32.29\n            = 31.51+30.74+30.74+30.60+29.97+29.55+29.19+30.67+30.81+31.23+32.64+32.43+32.29+33.34+34.89+35.81+36.65+36.79+35.46+33.77+33.06+32.64+32.50+32.29\n            = 750.76 / 24 = 31.28\n\n   The daily means: [31.67, 30.11, 30.09, 31.28] -> there is a dip in the middle and then a rise.\n\n   We might consider a linear trend? But the pattern is not linear. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days for the base?\n\n   However, for simplicity and because we are only forecasting 4 days, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n   But note: the last day (day4) is the most recent and might be more representative? \n\n   We can also consider using the average of the last two days for each hour to capture the recent pattern.\n\n   Let me compute the average for each hour over the last two days (day3 and day4) and then use that for the next 4 days? \n\n   However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). We can use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   I choose: \n        For each hour h (0 to 23), compute:\n            base_h = (value of h on day3 + value of h on day4) / 2\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, each day will have the same 24 values: [base_0, base_1, ..., base_23]\n\n   Why last two days? Because the first two days are a bit different (higher on day1, then lower on day2 and day3, then day4 is higher again). \n   But we don't have a clear trend, so using the last two days might be a safe average.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the entire 4 days to get a more stable average. Let's do that to avoid overemphasizing the last two days.\n\n   So, for each hour h, base_h = (day1_h + day2_h + day3_h + day4_h) / 4.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is just repeating the base_h for each hour of the day, for 4 days.\n\n   Let's compute the base_h for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (31.233999 + 29.334999 + 30.531000 + 31.514999) / 4\n        Hour 1: (31.375000 + 29.405001 + 30.038000 + 30.742001) / 4\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n        2016-08-14 00:00:00 -> base_0\n        2016-08-14 01:00:00 -> base_1\n        ...\n        2016-08-14 23:00:00 -> base_23\n        2016-08-15 00:00:00 -> base_0\n        ... until 2016-08-17 23:00:00 -> base_23\n\n   This will give 96 points.\n\n   We must generate the dates as well.\n\n   The last date in the input is 2016-08-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-14 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2016-08-15 00:00:00 to 2016-08-15 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2016-08-16 00:00:00 to 2016-08-16 23:00:00\n        Day 5: 2016-08-17 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00\n\n   We'll generate these dates and then assign the base_h accordingly.\n\n   Let's compute the base_h for each hour index (0 to 23) by averaging the 4 days.\n\n   We'll write a program in our mind to compute these 24 values.\n\n   However, note: the data is given in a fixed order.
