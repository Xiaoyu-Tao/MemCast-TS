        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and the frequency is hourly, \n    we can consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple moving average. However, we must account for \n    potential seasonality (daily seasonality of 24 hours).\n\n 4. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n    Since the data shows fluctuations within each day, we can try to use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. We choose to use the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. We will try to determine the orders.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method if the data is not too complex. Let's examine the data:\n\n    - The data has a daily pattern: temperatures are higher during the day and lower at night? But note the values:\n        For example, on 2016-11-30: \n          00:00: 12.874, then rises to 16.25 at 19:00, then drops to 16.11 at 23:00.\n        On 2016-12-01: \n          starts at 15.969, then goes down to 14.21 at 23:00.\n\n    - There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n 7. Given the short history, we might use a naive seasonal model: using the last day (24 hours) as the forecast for the next day?\n    But note: the last day (2016-12-03) has values that are generally higher than the previous days? \n\n 8. However, we are to forecast 96 points. We can break it into 4 days and use the same pattern? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or use a state space model.\n\n10. Given the constraints, we will use the `statsmodels` library to fit a model. However, since we are in a text-based environment, \n    we cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a pre-defined method or a simple heuristic.\n\n11. But note: the problem says we are an expert, so we must provide a forecast. We are allowed to use any method, but we must be aware of missing values (which are not present in the given data).\n\n12. Since we cannot run code, we will use a simple method: \n    We observe that the data has a daily seasonality. We can compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n    However, there might be a trend? Let's check:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-11-30): average temperature? \n        We can compute: (12.874+13.225+...+16.108999+15.406+16.108999)/24 -> but we don't have to compute exactly.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-03) and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n    But note: the data from 2016-12-03 is the most recent and might be the most relevant.\n\n13. However, the problem requires 96 points. We can use the following:\n\n    We take the last 24 hours (2016-12-03 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00) and then replicate that for the next 4 days? \n    But that would be 4 identical days. That might not be realistic.\n\n14. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. \n\n    For example, for hour 00:00:00, we have:\n        2016-11-30: 12.874\n        2016-12-01: 15.969\n        2016-12-02: 13.718\n        2016-12-03: 11.818\n        Average = (12.874 + 15.969 + 13.718 + 11.818) / 4 = 13.59475\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, we set the 00:00:00 to 13.59475? But that would be the same value for each day? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average pattern but adjust by a linear trend? \n\n15. We can compute the overall average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        - Group by hour (i.e., 0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n        - Then for the next 4 days, we use the same mean value for each hour.\n\n    But note: we are losing the trend. The data might have a slight downward trend? \n\n    Let's check the first day and the last day:\n\n        2016-11-30: 00:00: 12.874, 23:00: 16.108999\n        2016-12-03: 00:00: 11.818, 23:00: 17.516001\n\n    The last day seems to have higher temperatures at the end of the day? \n\n16. Alternatively, we can use a moving average to smooth and then project? \n\n17. Given the complexity and without being able to run code, we decide to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n    We will compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n    This method is called the seasonal naive method with seasonality of 24 hours, but using the average of the last 4 seasons.\n\n18. How to compute:\n\n    We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We create 24 groups:\n\n        hour0: [12.874, 15.969, 13.718, 11.818] -> average = (12.874+15.969+13.718+11.818)/4 = 13.59475\n        hour1: [13.225, 14.421, 13.225, 11.748] -> (13.225+14.421+13.225+11.748)/4 = 13.15475\n        ... and so on.\n\n    Then the forecast for:\n        2016-12-04 00:00:00: 13.59475\n        2016-12-04 01:00:00: 13.15475\n        ... \n        and then for 2016-12-05, 2016-12-06, 2016-12-07 we use the same pattern.\n\n19. But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n20. We will compute the average for each hour and then assign that to the next 4 days.\n\n21. However, we must format the answer exactly as the input: two columns (date and OT) and 96 rows.\n\n22. We generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-12-04 00:00:00.\n\n    The last given date is 2016-12-03 23:00:00, so the next date is 2016-12-04 00:00:00.\n\n    We need 96 hours: \n        2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n23. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n    We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n    How to compute for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        day1: 2016-11-30 00:00:00 -> 12.874\n        day2: 2016-12-01 00:00:00 -> 15.969\n        day3: 2016-12-02 00:00:00 -> 13.718\n        day4: 2016-12-03 00:00:00 -> 11.818\n        avg0 = (12.874 + 15.969 + 13.718 + 11.818) / 4 = 13.59475\n\n    Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        day1: 13.225\n        day2: 14.421\n        day3: 13.225\n        day4: 11.748\n        avg1 = (13.225+14.421+13.225+11.748)/4 = 13.15475\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n24. Then the forecast for the first day (2016-12-04) will be:\n        hour0: avg0\n        hour1: avg1\n        ... hour23: avg23\n\n    The second day (2016-12-05) will be the same: \n        hour0: avg0\n        hour1: avg1\n        ... \n\n    And so on for 4 days.\n\n25. We must round to 3 decimal places as in the original data? The original data has 3 decimal places.\n\n26. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    We'll list the data by hour index (0-23) for the 4 days:\n\n    Hour 0: [12.874, 15.969, 13.718, 11.818] -> 13.59475 -> 13.595 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n    Hour 1: [13.225, 14.421, 13.225, 11.748] -> 13.15475 -> 13.155\n    Hour 2: [13.929, 15.265, 12.592, 11.748] -> (13.929+15.265+12.592+11.748)/4 = 13.3835 -> 13.384\n    Hour 3: [15.476, 14.984, 12.381, 11.678] -> (15.476+14.984+12.381+11.678)/4 = 13.62975 -> 13.630\n    Hour 4: [15.054, 14.562, 11.889, 12.592] -> (15.054+14.562+11.889+12.592)/4 = 13.52425 -> 13.524\n    Hour 5: [14.773, 14.140, 11.537, 13.225] -> (14.773+14.140+11.537+13.225)/4 = 13.41875 -> 13.419\n    Hour 6: [12.170, 14.703, 11.467, 13.436] -> (12.170+14.703+11.467+13.436)/4 = 12.944 -> 12.944\n    Hour 7: [13.929, 14.351, 11.044, 12.944] -> (13.929+14.351+11.044+12.944)/4 = 13.067 -> 13.067\n    But wait, the hour 7 of the last day (2016-12-03) is 12.944? Actually, the data for 2016-12-03 07:00:00 is missing? \n    Let me check the data:\n\n        The data for 2016-12-03:\n            2016-12-03 00:00:00 11.818000\n            2016-12-03 01:00:00 11.748000\n            2016-12-03 02:00:00 11.748000\n            2016-12-03 03:00:00 11.678000\n            2016-12-03 04:00:00 12.592000\n            2016-12-03 05:00:00 13.225000\n            2016-12-03 06:00:00 13.436000\n            2016-12-03 07:00:00 12.944000   -> yes, it's 12.944\n\n    So we have all the data.\n\n    Continue:\n\n    Hour 8: [14.069, 14.491, 10.833, 13.366] -> (14.069+14.491+10.833+13.366)/4 = 13.18975 -> 13.190\n    Hour 9: [12.170, 14.140, 11.044, 12.733] -> (12.170+14.140+11.044+12.733)/4 = 12.52175 -> 12.522\n    Hour 10: [12.803, 14.562, 11.044, 13.788] -> (12.803+14.562+11.044+13.788)/4 = 13.04925 -> 13.049\n    Hour 11: [13.366, 17.868, 11.818, 14.843] -> (13.366+17.868+11.818+14.843)/4 = 14.47375 -> 14.474\n    Hour 12: [13.014, 17.305, 12.522, 16.320999] -> (13.014+17.305+12.522+16.321)/4 = 14.7905 -> 14.791\n    Hour 13: [13.296, 17.657, 14.491, 18.219999] -> (13.296+17.657+14.491+18.220)/4 = 15.916 -> 15.916\n    Hour 14: [14.491, 16.250, 14.703, 18.993999] -> (14.491+16.250+14.703+18.994)/4 = 16.1095 -> 16.110\n    Hour 15: [14.140, 15.547, 13.366, 17.798] -> (14.140+15.547+13.366+17.798)/4 = 15.21275 -> 15.213\n    Hour 16: [14.632, 15.898, 13.436, 18.642] -> (14.632+15.898+13.436+18.642)/4 = 15.652 -> 15.652\n    Hour 17: [15.898, 16.250, 13.507, 17.726999] -> (15.898+16.250+13.507+17.727)/4 = 15.845 -> 15.845\n    Hour 18: [16.108999, 16.461, 13.085, 17.587] -> (16.109+16.461+13.085+17.587)/4 = 15.8105 -> 15.811\n    Hour 19: [16.250, 15.617, 13.085, 17.305] -> (16.250+15.617+13.085+17.305)/4 = 15.56425 -> 15.564\n    Hour 20: [15.828, 16.391001, 12.451, 18.361] -> (15.828+16.391+12.451+18.361)/4 = 15.75775 -> 15.758\n    Hour 21: [16.108999, 16.250, 12.662, 18.219999] -> (16.109+16.250+12.662+18.220)/4 = 15.81025 -> 15.810\n    Hour 22: [15.406, 14.703, 11.678, 17.305] -> (15.406+14.703+11.678+17.305)/4 = 14.773 -> 14.773\n    Hour 23: [16.108999, 14.210, 11.889, 17.516001] -> (16.109+14.210+11.889+17.516)/4 = 14.931 -> 14.931\n\n27.
