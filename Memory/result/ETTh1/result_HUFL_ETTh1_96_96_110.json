        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). We can observe that the load drops during the day and rises at night.\n 2. We note that there might be missing values, but the provided 96 points are consecutive and without gaps? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, but the given past 96 records are provided without any missing values? \n    Since we are only given 96 consecutive points without missing values, we can proceed to model the time series.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the hourly data and daily seasonality (period=24), \n    we can use a model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, note that the data has:\n    - A clear daily pattern (24 hours)\n    - Also, there might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the limited history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that uses the daily seasonality.\n\n 5. We'll use the Holt-Winters method (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality) because it is suitable for such seasonality and short-term forecasting.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive method, but Holt-Winters might capture the trend and seasonality better.\n\n 7. However, note that the data has a trend within each day? Let's observe:\n    - Each day starts with relatively high values at midnight, then decreases until around 10:00-12:00, then increases again until the next day.\n\n 8. We can also consider using a SARIMA model. But with only 96 points, we have to be cautious about over-parameterization.\n\n 9. Given the time and the requirement, we can use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, which can handle seasonality.\n\n 10. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n     - We have additive or multiplicative seasonality? The amplitude of the seasonality seems to be relatively constant? \n        Looking at the data: \n          Day 1: min ~ -18.15, max ~ 13.33\n          Day 2: min ~ -11.45, max ~ 13.46\n          Day 3: min ~ -16.34, max ~ 14.33\n          Day 4: min ~ -17.28, max ~ 14.27\n        The variation in the amplitude is present, but not extremely increasing. We can try additive.\n\n 11. We'll fit an ExponentialSmoothing model with:\n        trend: 'add' (since there might be a trend over the 4 days? but the overall trend is not clear) \n        seasonal: 'add'\n        seasonal_periods: 24\n\n 12. However, note that the data is only 4 days, so the seasonal period is 24, but we have 4 cycles. This is minimal for fitting.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: a seasonal naive forecast, which uses the last available season as the forecast. \n        That is, the forecast for 2017-09-18 00:00:00 would be the value of 2017-09-17 00:00:00, and so on.\n\n 14. But the problem is that the pattern might change? Also, note that the data from day to day is not exactly the same.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a moving window of the last 4 days? \n        However, the problem asks for 96 points, which is exactly 4 days.\n\n 16. We can also use an average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n        For example, the forecast for 00:00:00 would be the average of the 00:00:00 values of the 4 days we have.\n\n 17. But note: the data shows a pattern that the load on the last day (2017-09-17) is similar to the previous days? \n\n 18. Let's try to compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n        We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00:00): \n            Day1: 12.994, Day2: 12.324, Day3: 14.334, Day4: 14.267 -> average = (12.994+12.324+14.334+14.267)/4 = 13.47975\n\n        Similarly for other hours.\n\n 19. However, this method would ignore any trend. But we don't have a clear long-term trend in only 4 days.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-17) as the forecast? But that would be a seasonal naive with lag=24.\n\n 21. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have very limited data, we can use the average method.\n\n 22. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? However, the provided past data does not have missing values. \n        For the forecast, we are to generate 96 points without missing values.\n\n 23. We decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 24. Steps:\n        - We have 4 days, each with 24 hours -> total 96 points.\n        - We will group by the hour of the day (i.e., the time part: 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the average.\n\n 25. Then, we will generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the same averaged daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 26. However, note: the next 4 days might have a different pattern? But without more data, we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-17) as the forecast for the next day? But then we would repeat the same day 4 times? \n        That would be the seasonal naive with period 24 and extending 4 periods.\n\n 28. Let's compare the two:\n\n        Average: \n            - Smooths out the day-to-day variations.\n        Seasonal Naive (using the last day):\n            - Captures the last day's pattern.\n\n 29. Since we are only given 4 days, and the last day might be the most recent pattern, we can use the last day repeated 4 times? \n        But note: the problem does not specify any particular method.\n\n 30. However, the problem says: \"You are an expert\", so we should choose a reasonable method.\n\n 31. We can also consider a weighted average where the last day has more weight? But that complicates.\n\n 32. Given the context, I will choose the average of the 4 days for each hour. This is a simple and robust method for such a short history.\n\n 33. How to compute:\n\n        We have 4 days: \n            Day1: 2017-09-14 (index 0-23)\n            Day2: 2017-09-15 (index 24-47)\n            Day3: 2017-09-16 (index 48-71)\n            Day4: 2017-09-17 (index 72-95)\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): \n            values = [12.994, 12.324, 14.334, 14.267] -> average = (12.994+12.324+14.334+14.267)/4 = 13.47975\n\n        For hour 1 (01:00):\n            values = [13.195, 10.985, 12.927, 13.597] -> average = (13.195+10.985+12.927+13.597)/4 = 12.676\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 34. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same averaged day repeated 4 times.\n\n 35. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the history, so we assume the history is complete.\n\n 36. We'll generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-09-18 00:00:00.\n\n 37. Let's code the average for each hour:\n\n        We'll create an array of 24 values (each for an hour) by averaging the 4 days.\n\n        Then, we repeat this array 4 times to get 96 points.\n\n 38. Alternatively, we can use the mean of each hour across the 4 days.\n\n 39. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: (12.994 + 12.324 + 14.334 + 14.267) / 4 = 13.47975\n        hour1: (13.195 + 10.985 + 12.927 + 13.597) / 4 = 12.676\n        hour2: (12.257 + 9.846 + 12.391 + 12.458) / 4 = 11.738\n        hour3: (12.458 + 11.253 + 12.726 + 12.927) / 4 = 12.341\n        hour4: (13.329 + 10.315 + 14.334 + 13.396) / 4 = 12.8435\n        hour5: (10.784 + 12.257 + 14.334 + 10.918) / 4 = 12.07325\n        hour6: (12.592 + 12.726 + 12.458 + 12.994) / 4 = 12.6925\n        hour7: (7.636 + 7.368 + 9.109 + 9.176) / 4 = 8.32225\n        hour8: (-0.268 + 3.349 + 0.335 + 3.751) / 4 = 1.79175\n        hour9: (-8.306 + -2.813 + -8.573 + -9.109) / 4 = -7.20025\n        hour10: (-12.324 + -2.746 + -10.047 + -12.056) / 4 = -9.29325\n        hour11: (-15.472 + -3.952 + -13.530 + -11.119) / 4 = -11.01825\n        hour12: (-18.152 + -8.372 + -16.276 + -17.281) / 4 = -15.02025\n        hour13: (-16.544 + -11.454 + -16.343 + -15.606) / 4 = -14.98675\n        hour14: (-14.803 + -8.439 + -8.372 + -11.989) / 4 = -10.90075\n        hour15: (-10.047 + -4.823 + -10.918 + -8.172) / 4 = -8.49\n        hour16: (-4.220 + 0.402 + -4.421 + -3.215) / 4 = -2.8635\n        hour17: (3.885 + 5.224 + 3.282 + 3.751) / 4 = 4.0355\n        hour18: (6.765 + 6.564 + 6.698 + 7.502) / 4 = 6.88225\n        hour19: (7.368 + 7.636 + 7.703 + 8.908) / 4 = 7.90375\n        hour20: (7.033 + 8.239 + 7.904 + 8.372) / 4 = 7.887\n        hour21: (8.841 + 8.105 + 7.569 + 8.105) / 4 = 8.155\n        hour22: (8.908 + 10.717 + 9.578 + 9.042) / 4 = 9.56125\n        hour23: (10.382 + 13.463 + 13.329 + 9.578) / 4 = 11.688\n\n 40. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-09-18 to 2017-09-21) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-18): [13.47975, 12.676, 11.738, ... , 11.688]\n        Day2 (2017-09-19): same as Day1\n        Day3 (2017-09-20): same as Day1\n        Day4 (2017-09-21): same as Day1\n\n 41. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing values.\n\n 42. We'll output the dates and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n 43. Format the dates: \n        Start: 2017-09-18 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-09-21 23:00:00.\n\n 44. We'll generate the dates and the corresponding HUFL value.\n\n 45. We must output in the required format.\n\n 46. Let's write the data:\n\n        We have 96 rows.\n\n 47. We'll round the numbers to 6 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places, but we can output with 3 or 6? \n        The input had up to 3 decimal places, but we computed averages that might have more. \n        We'll output with 3 decimal places to match the input? But the problem does not specify. \n        However, the input had 3 decimal places, so we'll round to 3.\n\n 48. Alternatively, we can output as is? But the problem says \"complete data\", so we can output with the same precision? \n        The input had 3 decimal places, but we can output with 6 to be safe? \n\n 49. The problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output the numbers as we computed.\n\n 50. We'll output the numbers with 6 decimal places to be precise.\n\n 51. But note: the input had 3 decimal places, but the numbers are floats. We can output with 3? \n        the problem does not specify, but to be safe, we output with 6.\n\n 52. Alternatively, we can output with the same format as the input? The input had 3 decimal places. \n        However, the problem says \"complete data\", so we can output with 3 decimal places? \n\n 53. Let me check: the input has 3 decimal places, but note that the numbers are floats and might have more precision? \n        The input is given with 3 decimal places. We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 54. We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 55. However, note: the average might not be exactly representable with 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 56. Steps:\n\n        Let's compute the 24 averages and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        hour0: 13.480\n        hour1: 12.676 -> 12.676 -> but 12.676 is already 3 decimal? We can keep as is? \n        Actually, we can round to 3 decimal places: \n            hour0: (12.994+12.324+14.334+14.267) = 53.919 -> 53.919/4 = 13.47975 -> round to 13.480\n\n        But note: 13.47975 rounded to 3 decimals: \n            look at the 4th decimal: 7, which is >=5 -> round up: 13.480\n\n        Similarly, hour1: 12.676 -> 12.676 (exactly 12.676, so 12.676)\n\n 57. We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n 58. Then, we create the next 96 points by repeating the 24 rounded averages 4 times.\n\n 59. Generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-18 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-18 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-21 23:00:00.\n\n 60. Now, we write the data in the required format.\n\n 61. Example of the first few rows:\n\n        2017-09-18 00:00:00  13.480\n        2017-09-18 01:00:00  12.676\n        2017-09-18 02:00:00  11.738\n        ...\n\n 62. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 63. Let's compute the 24 averages and round them:\n\n        hour0: 13.47975 -> 13.480\n        hour1: 12.676 -> 12.676 (but 12.676 is 12.676, so we write 12.676? but we are rounding to 3 decimals, so 12.676 is fine)\n        However, 12.676 is already 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll compute each and round:\n\n        hour0: 13.480\n        hour1: 12.676\n        hour2: 11.738\n        hour3: 12.341\n        hour4: 12.844   (because 12.8435 -> 12.844)\n        hour5: 12.073   (12.07325 -> 12.073)\n        hour6: 12.693   (12.6925 -> 12.693)\n        hour7: 8.322    (8.32225 -> 8.322)\n        hour8: 1.792    (1.79175 -> 1.792)\n        hour9: -7.200   (-7.20025 -> -7.200)\n        hour10: -9.293   (-9.29325 -> -9.293)\n        hour11: -11.018  (-11.01825 -> -11.018)\n        hour12: -15.020  (-15.02025 -> -15.020)\n        hour13: -14.987  (-14.98675 -> -14.987) because 6.75 -> 7, so -14.987\n        Actually: -14.98675: \n            The 4th decimal is 7, so we round up the 3rd decimal: 6 becomes 7 -> -14.987\n        hour14: -10.901  (-10.90075 -> -10.901)\n        hour15: -8.490   (-8.49 -> but wait: -8.49 is -8.490? Actually, we have -8.49 exactly? \n                But we computed: (-10.047 -4.823 -10.918 -8.172) = -33.96 -> -33.96/4 = -8.49 -> so -8.490? \n                We can represent as -8.490 to have 3 decimals? \n                Actually, we can write -8.490. But note: the input had -8.306, so we can have 3 decimals.\n\n                However, the average is exactly -8.49? Then we write -8.490? \n                But the input sometimes had 3 decimals, sometimes 2? Actually, the input always had 3 decimals.\n\n                So we write: -8.490\n\n        But wait: the average for hour15: \n            (-10.047 + -4.823 + -10.918 + -8.172) = -34.0? \n            Let me compute: \n                10.047+4.823+10.918+8.172 = 33.96 -> so -33.96 -> divided by 4 -> -8.49 -> which is -8.490 when written to 3 decimals.\n\n        So we write -8.490.\n\n        hour16: -2.864   (-2.8635 -> -2.864)\n        hour17: 4.036    (4.0355 -> 4.036)\n        hour18: 6.882    (6.88225 -> 6.882)\n        hour19: 7.904    (7.90375 -> 7.904)\n        hour20: 7.887    (7.887 -> 7.887)\n        hour21: 8.155    (8.155 -> 8.155)   [exactly 8.155? we computed 8.155, so 8.155]\n        hour22: 9.561    (9.56125 -> 9.561)\n        hour23: 11.688   (11.688 -> 11.688) [exactly? 11.688]\n\n 64. Now, we have the 24 values:\n\n        [13.480, 12.676, 11.738, 12.341, 12.844, 12.073, 12.693, 8.322, 1.792, -7.200, -9.293, -11.018, -15.020, -14.987, -10.901, -8.490, -2.864, 4.036, 6.882, 7.904, 7.887, 8.155, 9.561, 11.688]\n\n 65. Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 66. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-18 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-18 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-18 23:00:00 -> first 24\n        Then 2017-09-19 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24 (same values as above)\n        Then 2017-09-20 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-09-21 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 67. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-18 00:00:00  13.480\n2017-09-18 01:00:00  12.676\n2017-09-18 02:00:00  11.738\n... \n2017-09-21 23:00:00  11.688\n```\n\n 68. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 69. Let's code the generation of the dates and the values.\n\n 70. We'll write the data in the answer block.\n\n 71. Note: We are not using any model that accounts for potential missing values in the future? \n        The problem says the data will have missing values, but we are generating the forecast without missing values. \n        The problem says: \"be aware of that\", but we are generating the forecast and we are to provide the complete data (without missing values). \n        So we are generating 96 points without any missing.\n\n 72. We are done.\n\n 73. However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only given HUFL? \n        And we are only forecasting HUFL? So we output only HUFL.\n\n 74. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns: date and HUFL.\n\n 75. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 76. Let's generate the 96 rows.\n\n 77. We have the 24-hour pattern:\n\n        pattern = [13.480, 12.676, 11.738, 12.341, 12.844, 12.073, 12.693, 8.322, 1.792, -7.200, -9.293, -11.018, -15.020, -14.987, -10.901, -8.490, -2.864, 4.036, 6.882, 7.904, 7.887, 8.155, 9.561, 11.688]\n\n 78. Then, for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = start_date + day_offset*24 hours + hour hours\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017,9,18,0,0,0)\n\n 79. We'll generate the dates = \n        \"2017-09-18 00:00:00\"\n        \"2017-09-18 01:00:00\"\n        ... \n        \"2017-09-21 23:00:00\"\n\n 80. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 81. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-18 00:00:00  13.480\n2017-09-18 01:00:00  12.676\n2017-09-18 02:00:00  11.738\n2017-09-18 03:00:00  12.341\n2017-09-18 04:00:00  12.844\n2017-09-18 05:00:00  12.073\n2017-09-18 06:00:00  12.693\n2017-09-18 07:00:00  8.322\n2017-09-18 08:00:00  1.792\n2017-09-18 09:00:00  -7.200\n2017-09-18 10:00:00  -9.293\n2017-09-18 11:00:00  -11.018\n2017-09-18 12:00:00  -15.020\n2017-09-18 13:00:00  -14.987\n2017-09-18 14:00:00  -10.901\n2017-09-18 15:00:00  -8.490\n2017-09-18 16:00:00  -2.864\n2017-09-18 17:00:00  4.036\n2017-09-18 18:00:00  6.882\n2017-09-18 19:00:00  7.904\n2017-09-18 20:00:00  7.887\n2017-09-18 21:00:00  8.155\n2017-09-18 22:00:00  9.561\n2017-09-18 23:00:00  11.688\n2017-09-19 00:00:00  13.480\n2017-09-19 01:00:00  12.676\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 82. We'll write the next 3 days similarly.\n\n 83. We must be careful: the last day is 2017-09-21 23:00:00.\n\n 84. We output the entire block.\n\n 85. Let's do it.\n",
