        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, as per the note, we should be aware of the possibility.\n    Since the provided data is complete, we can proceed without imputation for the historical part.\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data size (96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we can consider:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) to account for potential daily seasonality (24-hour cycle).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which can handle seasonality.\n    - Given the small data size, we might also consider simpler models.\n\n Observation:\n    The data shows a daily pattern (diurnal cycle). For example, on each day, the load tends to rise during the day and fall at night.\n\n 4. We will use a model that captures seasonality. Since the seasonality period is 24 (for hourly data with daily pattern), we can use SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that we only have 4 days of data (96 points). This is a very short series for a seasonal model with 24 periods. We might have to use a simpler model.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a rolling forecast method, but we are required to forecast 96 points.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can try:\n    - Using a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, but again, with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be well estimated.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the previous days to form a naive seasonal forecast. But we have only 4 days.\n\n 9. We can use a model that uses the last day (24 points) as a pattern and adjust by the overall level? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the small data, we will use a SARIMA model with a fixed seasonal period of 24. We'll try to automatically select the orders or use a simple one.\n\n 11. However, note: the data might have non-stationary elements. We can difference by 24 to remove the seasonal component and then model the remainder.\n\n 12. Given the time and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we will use a simple and robust method: \n     - We'll take the average of each hour over the 4 available days to form a daily profile. Then, we will use that profile for the next 4 days (96 hours) as the forecast.\n\n     Steps for the naive seasonal method:\n        - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n        - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat the daily profile 4 times.\n\n 13. Why this method?\n        - It is simple and captures the daily pattern.\n        - With only 4 days, it's hard to fit a complex model without overfitting.\n\n 14. But note: the data shows some variation from day to day. However, without more data, we cannot capture trends or changing patterns.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can also consider a weighted average where more recent days are given higher weight? But again, we have only 4 days.\n\n 16. We'll go with the simple average per hour.\n\n 17. Steps to compute:\n        - Extract the hour from the timestamp.\n        - Group by hour and compute the mean of LULL for that hour.\n\n 18. Then, we generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-05-16 23:00:00) to 2017-05-20 23:00:00 (96 hours later).\n\n 19. For each timestamp, we take the hour and assign the corresponding average value for that hour.\n\n 20. However, note: the data we are given ends at 2017-05-16 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n 21. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We have 4 days: 2017-05-13, 2017-05-14, 2017-05-15, 2017-05-16.\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00:00): \n            2017-05-13: 0.822\n            2017-05-14: 0.975\n            2017-05-15: 1.401\n            2017-05-16: 0.822\n            Average = (0.822 + 0.975 + 1.401 + 0.822) / 4 = 1.005\n\n        Similarly for other hours.\n\n 22. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 23. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the repetition of these 24 averages 4 times.\n\n 24. This method does not account for any trend, but with only 4 days, it's hard to estimate a trend.\n\n 25. We'll proceed with this method.\n\n 26. Compute the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-17 00:00:00\n        Then: 2017-05-17 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n 27. Format the output as per requirement.\n\n 28. Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none, we are safe to use the available points.\n\n 29. However, note: if in the future we had missing values, we would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware\", but we are only using the provided 96 points.\n\n 30. We'll write a small code in our mind to compute the hourly averages.\n\n 31. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n        Hour 0: (0.822 + 0.975 + 1.401 + 0.822) / 4 = 1.005\n        Hour 1: (0.822 + 0.883 + 1.401 + 0.883) / 4 = (0.822+0.883=1.705; 1.401+0.883=2.284; total=3.989) /4 = 0.99725\n        ... and so on.\n\n 32. But note: we have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n 33. We'll compute all 24 hours and then repeat 4 times.\n\n 34. However, to be precise, we'll do the averages for each hour.\n\n 35. We'll create a list of the 24 average values.\n\n 36. Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-05-17): [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n        Day2 (2017-05-18): [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n        Day3 (2017-05-19): [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n        Day4 (2017-05-20): [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n\n 37. We'll generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 38. We must output the numbers with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 39. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        We'll index the data by the hour of the day.\n\n        We have 4 days, so 4 rows per hour.\n\n        We can group by the time part (without the date).\n\n 40. We'll create a table for the 24 hours.\n\n        Hour 0: [0.822, 0.975, 1.401, 0.822] -> mean = (0.822+0.975+1.401+0.822)/4 = 4.02/4 = 1.005\n        Hour 1: [0.822, 0.883, 1.401, 0.883] -> (0.822+0.883+1.401+0.883)=3.989 -> 0.99725 -> 0.997\n        Hour 2: [0.792, 0.761, 1.432, 0.822] -> (0.792+0.761+1.432+0.822)=3.807 -> 0.95175 -> 0.952\n        Hour 3: [0.914, 0.914, 1.462, 0.883] -> (0.914+0.914+1.462+0.883)=4.173 -> 1.04325 -> 1.043\n        Hour 4: [0.944, 0.944, 1.462, 0.975] -> (0.944+0.944+1.462+0.975)=4.325 -> 1.08125 -> 1.081\n        Hour 5: [1.005, 0.975, 1.553, 0.914] -> (1.005+0.975+1.553+0.914)=4.447 -> 1.11175 -> 1.112\n        Hour 6: [1.218, 0.944, 1.675, 0.944] -> (1.218+0.944+1.675+0.944)=4.781 -> 1.19525 -> 1.195\n        Hour 7: [1.157, 1.066, 1.736, 1.005] -> (1.157+1.066+1.736+1.005)=4.964 -> 1.241\n        Hour 8: [1.310, 1.127, 1.432, 1.097] -> (1.310+1.127+1.432+1.097)=4.966 -> 1.2415 -> 1.242\n        Hour 9: [1.218, 1.188, 1.188, 1.066] -> (1.218+1.188+1.188+1.066)=4.660 -> 1.165\n        Hour 10: [1.127, 1.127, 1.097, 1.157] -> (1.127+1.127+1.097+1.157)=4.508 -> 1.127\n        Hour 11: [1.066, 0.944, 1.127, 1.097] -> (1.066+0.944+1.127+1.097)=4.234 -> 1.0585 -> 1.059\n        Hour 12: [0.853, 0.914, 1.005, 1.249] -> (0.853+0.914+1.005+1.249)=4.021 -> 1.00525 -> 1.005\n        Hour 13: [1.066, 0.975, 1.005, 1.157] -> (1.066+0.975+1.005+1.157)=4.203 -> 1.05075 -> 1.051\n        Hour 14: [1.097, 1.157, 1.218, 1.127] -> (1.097+1.157+1.218+1.127)=4.599 -> 1.14975 -> 1.150\n        Hour 15: [1.218, 1.127, 1.005, 1.218] -> (1.218+1.127+1.005+1.218)=4.568 -> 1.142\n        Hour 16: [0.975, 1.066, 1.005, 1.279] -> (0.975+1.066+1.005+1.279)=4.325 -> 1.08125 -> 1.081\n        Hour 17: [0.975, 1.066, 0.822, 1.127] -> (0.975+1.066+0.822+1.127)=3.990 -> 0.9975 -> 0.998\n        Hour 18: [0.914, 0.761, 0.640, 1.005] -> (0.914+0.761+0.640+1.005)=3.320 -> 0.830\n        Hour 19: [0.944, 0.761, 0.579, 1.157] -> (0.944+0.761+0.579+1.157)=3.441 -> 0.86025 -> 0.860\n        Hour 20: [1.310, 0.975, 0.731, 1.157] -> (1.310+0.975+0.731+1.157)=4.173 -> 1.04325 -> 1.043\n        Hour 21: [1.005, 0.975, 0.670, 0.944] -> (1.005+0.975+0.670+0.944)=3.594 -> 0.8985 -> 0.899\n        Hour 22: [1.036, 0.914, 0.822, 1.005] -> (1.036+0.914+0.822+1.005)=3.777 -> 0.94425 -> 0.944\n        Hour 23: [1.066, 0.914, 0.883, 0.944] -> (1.066+0.914+0.883+0.944)=3.807 -> 0.95175 -> 0.952\n\n 41. We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 42. Now, we create the forecast for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-05-17\n           00:00:00 -> 1.005\n           01:00:00 -> 0.997\n           02:00:00 -> 0.952\n           03:00:00 -> 1.043\n           04:00:00 -> 1.081\n           05:00:00 -> 1.112\n           06:00:00 -> 1.195\n           07:00:00 -> 1.241\n           08:00:00 -> 1.242\n           09:00:00 -> 1.165\n           10:00:00 -> 1.127\n           11:00:00 -> 1.059\n           12:00:00 -> 1.005\n           13:00:00 -> 1.051\n           14:00:00 -> 1.150\n           15:00:00 -> 1.142\n           16:00:00 -> 1.081\n           17:00:00 -> 0.998\n           18:00:00 -> 0.830\n           19:00:00 -> 0.860\n           20:00:00 -> 1.043\n           21:00:00 -> 0.899\n           22:00:00 -> 0.944\n           23:00:00 -> 0.952\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 43. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 44. We note that the last date in the input is 2017-05-16 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-05-17 00:00:00.\n\n 45. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 46. We write the output in the same format: two columns: \"date\" and \"LULL\", with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 47. We must output the next 96 dates and the corresponding forecasted LULL.\n\n 48. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 49. Since the problem says \"complete data\", we output all 96 rows.\n\n 50. We'll write the code to generate the dates and the repeated pattern.\n\n 51. We'll use the list of 24 values and repeat it 4 times.\n\n 52. The list of averages (rounded to 3 decimal places) for hours 0 to 23:\n\n        hour0: 1.005\n        hour1: 0.997\n        hour2: 0.952\n        hour3: 1.043\n        hour4: 1.081\n        hour5: 1.112\n        hour6: 1.195\n        hour7: 1.241\n        hour8: 1.242\n        hour9: 1.165\n        hour10: 1.127\n        hour11: 1.059\n        hour12: 1.005\n        hour13: 1.051\n        hour14: 1.150\n        hour15: 1.142\n        hour16: 1.081\n        hour17: 0.998\n        hour18: 0.830\n        hour19: 0.860\n        hour20: 1.043\n        hour21: 0.899\n        hour22: 0.944\n        hour23: 0.952\n\n 53. We'll create a list: \n        pattern = [1.005, 0.997, 0.952, 1.043, 1.081, 1.112, 1.195, 1.241, 1.242, 1.165, 1.127, 1.059, \n                   1.005, 1.051, 1.150, 1.142, 1.081, 0.998, 0.830, 0.860, 1.043, 0.899, 0.944, 0.952]\n\n 54. Then the forecast for 96 hours: \n        forecast = pattern * 4   (which gives 96 values)\n\n 55. Now, the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-17 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-05-17 01:00:00 ... until 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n 56. We can generate the dates by starting from '2017-05-17 00:00:00' and adding 1 hour for 96 times.\n\n 57. We'll write the output.\n\n 58. Format: \n        <answer>\n        date                LULL\n        2017-05-17 00:00:00 1.005\n        2017-05-17 01:00:00 0.997\n        ... \n        2017-05-20 23:00:00 0.952\n\n 59. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 60. We do it.\n\n 61. Note: We are rounding the averages to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 62. We are aware that this is a naive method, but with the given data size, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 63. If we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model.\n\n 64. We output the answer.\n",
