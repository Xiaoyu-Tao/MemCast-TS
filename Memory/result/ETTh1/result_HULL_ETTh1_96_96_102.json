        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 timestamps.\n\n 3. We choose a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, we can consider:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or Seasonal ARIMA (since there might be daily seasonality, i.e., seasonality of 24 hours).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simple method like a seasonal naive forecast, but that might not capture trends.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows:\n    - A daily pattern: for example, on 2017-08-13, we see positive values during the night and early morning, then negative in the afternoon and evening, and then positive again at night.\n    - But the pattern is not very consistent across days.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete answer, we will use a simple method that can handle the seasonality: \n    We will use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component by repeating the last season (i.e., the last 24 hours) and adjusting by the trend.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an automated method like using the `statsmodels` library to fit a Seasonal ARIMA model. However, without the ability to run code, we must rely on a conceptual approach.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we assume the given data is complete for the last 96 points.\n\n 8. Since we are to provide the forecast without running actual code (as this is a simulated environment), we must generate a reasonable forecast.\n\n 9. Approach for simulation:\n    - We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24 hours). We can compute the average daily pattern from the 4 days we have and then use that as the seasonal component.\n    - Then we can compute the trend from the last few points? But the trend over 4 days might be minimal.\n\n 10. However, looking at the data, there is a noticeable change from day to day. For example, the values on 2017-08-16 are generally higher than the previous days.\n\n 11. We can try to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-16) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous day? But without a clear trend, we might just repeat the last day's pattern for the next 4 days? However, the problem asks for 96 points (4 days) and we have 4 days of history.\n\n 13. Considering the above, we will use a seasonal naive forecast: \n      Forecast for 2017-08-17 00:00:00 = value of 2017-08-16 00:00:00\n      Forecast for 2017-08-17 01:00:00 = value of 2017-08-16 01:00:00\n      ... until 2017-08-17 23:00:00 = value of 2017-08-16 23:00:00\n      Then for 2017-08-18, we use the same pattern as 2017-08-16? But we don't have data beyond 2017-08-16.\n\n 14. However, the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided data there are none. So for the forecast, we assume no missing values in the output.\n\n 15. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". It might mean that in the original dataset there are missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we are to forecast without gaps.\n\n 16. We decide to use the last season (24 hours) repeated 4 times. That is, we take the 24 hours of 2017-08-16 and repeat them for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. Why 2017-08-16? Because it is the most recent day and might be the most relevant.\n\n 18. The data for 2017-08-16:\n      00:00:00  3.483\n      01:00:00  2.947\n      02:00:00  2.277\n      03:00:00  1.608\n      04:00:00  2.076\n      05:00:00  1.808\n      06:00:00  1.541\n      07:00:00  1.674\n      08:00:00 -1.139\n      09:00:00  0.603\n      10:00:00  1.608\n      11:00:00  1.139\n      12:00:00  0.871\n      13:00:00  0.603\n      14:00:00  3.215\n      15:00:00  3.818\n      16:00:00  2.679\n      17:00:00  1.741\n      18:00:00  0.536\n      19:00:00 -0.670\n      20:00:00  0.067\n      21:00:00  1.541\n      22:00:00  1.608\n      23:00:00  2.478\n\n 19. We will repeat this pattern for the next 4 days (from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00).\n\n 20. However, note that the problem says \"High UseLess Load\" and the values can be negative. This method is simple and might be acceptable.\n\n 21. But let's check: the data from 2017-08-13 to 2017-08-16 does not show a strong seasonality that repeats exactly. However, without a more sophisticated model, and given the constraints, we use this.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we could average the four days for each hour? Let's try:\n\n      Hour 00:00: (1.808, 1.808, 1.541, 3.483) -> average = (1.808+1.808+1.541+3.483)/4 = 8.64/4 = 2.16\n      ... but then we lose the most recent pattern.\n\n 23. We choose the most recent day because it might capture the latest trend.\n\n 24. Therefore, we will use the values of 2017-08-16 for the next 4 days.\n\n 25. Generate the dates:\n      Start: 2017-08-17 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-08-16 23:00:00)\n      Then 2017-08-17 01:00:00 ... up to 2017-08-20 23:00:00.\n\n 26. The forecasted values for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the 24 values of 2017-08-16 repeated 4 times.\n\n 27. Write the answer in the required structure.\n\n 28. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 29. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-17 00:00:00  3.483\n2017-08-17 01:00:00  2.947\n...

However, note that the last day in the provided data is 2017-08-16, so 2017-08-17 is the next day.\n\n 31. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-17 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Day 2: 2017-08-18 00:00:00 to 2017-08-18 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Day 3: 2017-08-19 00:00:00 to 2017-08-19 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Day 4: 2017-08-20 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n\n 32. The values for each day are the same as 2017-08-16.\n\n 33. Therefore, we write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-17 00:00:00  3.483\n2017-08-17 01:00:00  2.947\n2017-08-17 02:00:00  2.277\n2017-08-17 03:00:00  1.608\n2017-08-17 04:00:00  2.076\n2017-08-17 05:00:00  1.808\n2017-08-17 06:00:00  1.541\n2017-08-17 07:00:00  1.674\n2017-08-17 08:00:00 -1.139\n2017-08-17 09:00:00  0.603\n2017-08-17 10:00:00  1.608\n2017-08-17 11:00:00  1.139\n2017-08-17 12:00:00  0.871\n2017-08-17 13:00:00  0.603\n2017-08-17 14:00:00  3.215\n2017-08-17 15:00:00  3.818\n2017-08-17 16:00:00  2.679\n2017-08-17 17:00:00  1.741\n2017-08-17 18:00:00  0.536\n2017-08-17 19:00:00 -0.670\n2017-08-17 20:00:00  0.067\n2017-08-17 21:00:00  1.541\n2017-08-17 22:00:00  1.608\n2017-08-17 23:00:00  2.478\n2017-08-18 00:00:00  3.483\n2017-08-18 01:00:00  2.947\n... (repeat the same 24 values for 2017-08-18, 2017-08-19, and 2017-08-20)\n\n```\n\n 34. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 35. However, note that the last value of the provided data is 2017-08-16 23:00:00 (which is 2.478). The first forecasted value is for 2017-08-17 00:00:00, which we set to 3.483 (the value of 2017-08-16 00:00:00).\n\n 36. This is a simple and straightforward method. In practice, one might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints, we use the seasonal naive method with the last available season.\n\n 37. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 38. Let's code the repetition: we have 24 values for one day, and we repeat them 4 times.\n\n 39. The values for 2017-08-16 (in order) are:\n        [3.483, 2.947, 2.277, 1.608, 2.076, 1.808, 1.541, 1.674, -1.139, 0.603, 1.608, 1.139, 0.871, 0.603, 3.215, 3.818, 2.679, 1.741, 0.536, -0.670, 0.067, 1.541, 1.608, 2.478]\n\n 40. We will repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 41. The dates:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-08-17\n      Day 2: 2017-08-18\n      Day 3: 2017-08-19\n      Day 4: 2017-08-20\n\n 42. For each day, we generate 24 hours.\n\n 43. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n 44. Note: The format must be exactly as the input, with the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the value as a float with three decimal places? The input has one to three decimal places. We'll keep the same precision.\n\n 45. We outputting the numbers as they are (with the same decimal places as in the provided data for 2017-08-16).\n\n 46. Now, we write the answer.\n",
