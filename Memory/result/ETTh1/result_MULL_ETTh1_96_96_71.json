        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values.\n    However, the provided data for the past 96 points is complete. So for forecasting, we assume the model can handle any inherent patterns.\n\n 2. We must choose a forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need for 96 steps ahead, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Seasonality: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not evident.\n    - Trend: The data seems to fluctuate without a clear long-term trend in the given 4 days.\n\n 3. Since the data is relatively short (only 4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days, we can use a model like:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n    - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n\n 4. But note: the data has negative values, so we cannot use models that require positive data (like multiplicative seasonality) without transformation.\n\n 5. However, the problem says the data may have missing values. Since the provided data is complete, we can proceed to model without imputation for now.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast for 96 points, we can use an automated model from statsmodels or similar.\n\n 7. But note: we are in a simulated environment and cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a simple method that can be reasoned.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a naive approach? But that would not be accurate.\n\n 9. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points, we must generate 96 values.\n\n 10. Approach:\n     We can use a simple average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n     Let's break the data into daily profiles:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-04-11): 24 values\n        Day 2 (2017-04-12): 24 values\n        Day 3 (2017-04-13): 24 values\n        Day 4 (2017-04-14): 24 values\n\n     We can forecast the next 4 days (2017-04-15 to 2017-04-18) by:\n\n        Option 1: Using the average of the same hour for the past 4 days.\n        Option 2: Using the last day (Day 4) as the forecast for the next day, then the day before, etc. But that would be repeating the same pattern.\n\n     However, note that the data does not show a clear repeating pattern. For example, the values at 00:00: \n        04-11: 0.213\n        04-12: -0.391\n        04-13: 0.142\n        04-14: 0.000\n\n     The average for hour 00:00: (0.213 -0.391 + 0.142 + 0.000)/4 = (0.213 -0.391 = -0.178; -0.178+0.142=-0.036; -0.036+0.000=-0.036) -> -0.009\n\n     Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n 11. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. Since we are not given any missing values in the input, we can use the available 4 days.\n\n 12. We'll create a forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) by taking the average of each hour across the 4 days.\n\n 13. However, we must generate the dates. The last date in the input is 2017-04-14 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-15 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        2017-04-16 00:00:00 to 2017-04-16 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        2017-04-17 00:00:00 to 2017-04-17 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        2017-04-18 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n\n 14. We'll compute the average for hour 0 (00:00) from the 4 days: \n        hour0 = [0.213, -0.391, 0.142, 0.000] -> average = (0.213 -0.391 + 0.142 + 0.000)/4 = (-0.036)/4 = -0.009\n\n     Similarly for hour 1 (01:00): [0.284, -0.569, 0.036, -0.142] -> (0.284 -0.569 + 0.036 -0.142) = (-0.391)/4 = -0.09775\n\n     And so on for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 15. Then the forecast for each day will be the same: the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n 16. But note: this method ignores any trend. However, without a clear trend and with only 4 days, it's a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we could use the median? But the problem does not specify.\n\n 18. We'll use the average (mean) for each hour.\n\n 19. Steps for computation:\n\n     For hour in 0 to 23:\n        values = [value at that hour from day1, day2, day3, day4]\n        forecast_value = mean(values)\n\n     Then for each of the next 4 days, the hour0 will be the same forecast_value for hour0, etc.\n\n 20. However, the forecast for the next 4 days will be identical for the same hour of the day.\n\n 21. Let's compute the 24 average values:\n\n        hour0: [0.213, -0.391, 0.142, 0.000] -> (0.213 -0.391 + 0.142 + 0.000) = -0.036 -> -0.009\n        hour1: [0.284, -0.569, 0.036, -0.142] -> (0.284 -0.569 = -0.285; -0.285+0.036=-0.249; -0.249-0.142=-0.391) -> -0.09775\n        hour2: [0.320, -0.249, 0.249, -0.462] -> (0.320 -0.249 = 0.071; 0.071+0.249=0.320; 0.320-0.462=-0.142) -> -0.0355\n        hour3: [0.142, -0.604, 0.355, -0.569] -> (0.142 -0.604 = -0.462; -0.462+0.355=-0.107; -0.107-0.569=-0.676) -> -0.169\n        hour4: [-0.142, -0.462, 0.497, -0.746] -> (-0.142 -0.462 = -0.604; -0.604+0.497=-0.107; -0.107-0.746=-0.853) -> -0.21325\n        hour5: [-0.213, -0.604, -0.355, 0.107] -> (-0.213 -0.604 = -0.817; -0.817-0.355=-1.172; -1.172+0.107=-1.065) -> -0.26625\n        hour6: [0.000, -0.213, -0.497, -0.959] -> (0.000 -0.213 = -0.213; -0.213-0.497=-0.71; -0.71-0.959=-1.669) -> -0.41725\n        hour7: [-0.391, -0.178, 0.355, -0.497] -> (-0.391 -0.178 = -0.569; -0.569+0.355=-0.214; -0.214-0.497=-0.711) -> -0.17775\n        hour8: [0.426, 0.497, 1.670, 1.244] -> (0.426+0.497=0.923; 0.923+1.670=2.593; 2.593+1.244=3.837) -> 0.95925\n        hour9: [-1.919, 0.036, 0.355, 1.564] -> (-1.919+0.036=-1.883; -1.883+0.355=-1.528; -1.528+1.564=0.036) -> 0.009\n        hour10: [-1.777, 1.102, 1.777, 1.599] -> (-1.777+1.102=-0.675; -0.675+1.777=1.102; 1.102+1.599=2.701) -> 0.67525\n        hour11: [-0.533, 4.087, 0.675, 2.878] -> (-0.533+4.087=3.554; 3.554+0.675=4.229; 4.229+2.878=7.107) -> 1.77675\n        hour12: [-1.670, 0.249, 2.168, 1.741] -> (-1.670+0.249=-1.421; -1.421+2.168=0.747; 0.747+1.741=2.488) -> 0.622\n        hour13: [0.320, 1.706, 0.213, 2.025] -> (0.320+1.706=2.026; 2.026+0.213=2.239; 2.239+2.025=4.264) -> 1.066\n        hour14: [-0.995, 1.706, 2.487, 1.421] -> (-0.995+1.706=0.711; 0.711+2.487=3.198; 3.198+1.421=4.619) -> 1.15475\n        hour15: [-0.711, 0.533, 1.279, 0.284] -> (-0.711+0.533=-0.178; -0.178+1.279=1.101; 1.101+0.284=1.385) -> 0.34625\n        hour16: [-1.102, -0.640, -0.569, 0.284] -> (-1.102-0.640=-1.742; -1.742-0.569=-2.311; -2.311+0.284=-2.027) -> -0.50675\n        hour17: [-1.492, -0.995, -1.350, -0.604] -> (-1.492-0.995=-2.487; -2.487-1.350=-3.837; -3.837-0.604=-4.441) -> -1.11025\n        hour18: [-2.132, -1.848, -2.132, -1.706] -> (-2.132-1.848=-3.98; -3.98-2.132=-6.112; -6.112-1.706=-7.818) -> -1.9545\n        hour19: [-2.274, -2.310, -2.239, -1.492] -> (-2.274-2.310=-4.584; -4.584-2.239=-6.823; -6.823-1.492=-8.315) -> -2.07875\n        hour20: [-2.345, -2.061, -2.132, -1.421] -> (-2.345-2.061=-4.406; -4.406-2.132=-6.538; -6.538-1.421=-7.959) -> -1.98975\n        hour21: [-2.736, -2.807, -2.097, -1.812] -> (-2.736-2.807=-5.543; -5.543-2.097=-7.64; -7.64-1.812=-9.452) -> -2.363\n        hour22: [-1.954, -1.777, -2.203, -0.497] -> (-1.954-1.777=-3.731; -3.731-2.203=-5.934; -5.934-0.497=-6.431) -> -1.60775\n        hour23: [-0.853, -1.492, -0.604, -0.640] -> (-0.853-1.492=-2.345; -2.345-0.604=-2.949; -2.949-0.640=-3.589) -> -0.89725\n\n 22. Now, we create the next 4 days (2017-04-15 to 2017-04-18) by repeating these 24 average values for each day.\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are generating a forecast without gaps.\n\n 24. Format: We must output the next 96 records in the same format as the input, with the date and the forecasted MULL.\n\n 25. We'll generate the dates starting from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n\n 26. The first forecasted point: 2017-04-15 00:00:00 -> -0.009\n        then 2017-04-15 01:00:00 -> -0.09775, and so on.\n\n 27. We must output the numbers with 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 28. However, note: the input has some values with 3 decimal places, but also integers (like 0.000) which are shown with 3 decimals.\n\n 29. We'll round the forecasted values to 3 decimal places.\n\n 30. Let's round the computed average:\n\n        hour0: -0.009 -> -0.009\n        hour1: -0.09775 -> -0.098\n        ... \n\n 31. We'll compute the rounded values:\n\n        hour0: -0.009\n        hour1: -0.09775 -> -0.098\n        hour2: -0.0355 -> -0.036\n        hour3: -0.169 -> -0.169\n        hour4: -0.21325 -> -0.213\n        hour5: -0.26625 -> -0.266\n        hour6: -0.41725 -> -0.417\n        hour7: -0.17775 -> -0.178\n        hour8: 0.95925 -> 0.959\n        hour9: 0.009 -> 0.009\n        hour10: 0.67525 -> 0.675\n        hour11: 1.77675 -> 1.777\n        hour12: 0.622 -> 0.622\n        hour13: 1.066 -> 1.066\n        hour14: 1.15475 -> 1.155\n        hour15: 0.34625 -> 0.346\n        hour16: -0.50675 -> -0.507\n        hour17: -1.11025 -> -1.110\n        hour18: -1.9545 -> -1.955\n        hour19: -2.07875 -> -2.079\n        hour20: -1.98975 -> -1.990\n        hour21: -2.363 -> -2.363\n        hour22: -1.60775 -> -1.608\n        hour23: -0.89725 -> -0.897\n\n 32. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-15: from hour0 to hour23 with the above 24 values.\n        Day2: 2017-04-16: same 24 values.\n        Day3: 2017-04-17: same 24 values.\n        Day4: 2017-04-18: same 24 values.\n\n 33. We must be cautious: the input data ends at 2017-04-14 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-04-15 00:00:00.\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-15 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n\n 35. We output in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MULL', with the date in the index? The input had the date as index and then a column 'MULL'. But the output format should be:\n\n        <answer>\n        date                 MULL\n        2017-04-15 00:00:00  -0.009\n        2017-04-15 01:00:00  -0.098\n        ... \n\n 36. We write 96 lines.\n\n 37. However, note: the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 time points (each hour).\n\n 38. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 39. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\n\n 40. We'll write the data in the same way as the input: one line per time point, with the date and the value.\n\n 41. Let's generate the data:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-04-15\n           00:00:00 -> -0.009\n           01:00:00 -> -0.098\n           02:00:00 -> -0.036\n           03:00:00 -> -0.169\n           04:00:00 -> -0.213\n           05:00:00 -> -0.266\n           06:00:00 -> -0.417\n           07:00:00 -> -0.178\n           08:00:00 -> 0.959\n           09:00:00 -> 0.009\n           10:00:00 -> 0.675\n           11:00:00 -> 1.777\n           12:00:00 -> 0.622\n           13:00:00 -> 1.066\n           14:00:00 -> 1.155\n           15:00:00 -> 0.346\n           16:00:00 -> -0.507\n           17:00:00 -> -1.110\n           18:00:00 -> -1.955\n           19:00:00 -> -2.079\n           20:00:00 -> -1.990\n           21:00:00 -> -2.363\n           22:00:00 -> -1.608\n           23:00:00 -> -0.897\n\n        Then repeat the same for 2017-04-16, 2017-04-17, 2017-04-18.\n\n 42. We write the data in the answer block.\n\n 43. Note: This is a simple average method. In practice, one might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 44. We output the data.\n",
