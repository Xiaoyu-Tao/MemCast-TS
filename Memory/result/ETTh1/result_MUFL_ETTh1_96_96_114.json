        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. But we are told that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided segment, there are no missing. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days), we can assume a daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly seasonality (168 hours) might be present. However, with only 4 days of data, it's challenging to capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we might focus on daily patterns.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement to handle potential missing values (though not present in the given data) and the need for a forecast, we can use a model that can handle time series with seasonality. One common approach is to use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 96 points, we must be cautious.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the time series to extract the trend, seasonality, and residuals.\n    - Extrapolate the trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 5. But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern. We can average the values for each hour across the 4 days to get a daily profile, and then use that to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours). However, we must account for any trend? The data does not show a strong trend over 4 days.\n\n 6. Let's check: \n    - The values at 00:00: 9.132, 9.097, 8.102, 6.538 -> decreasing? \n    - But then again at 01:00: 8.813, 9.488, 7.924, 6.361 -> also decreasing.\n\n 7. However, the last day (2017-10-03) has lower values. This might be a downward trend? But we have only 4 days. We might use a moving average to smooth and then project the trend.\n\n 8. Considering the above, we can do:\n    Step 1: Impute any missing values in the given data (if there were any, but in this segment there are none).\n    Step 2: Create a daily profile by averaging the 4 days for each hour (0 to 23).\n    Step 3: Subtract the daily profile from the data to get the residual (which might contain trend and noise).\n    Step 4: Model the residual with a linear regression (or moving average) to capture the trend.\n    Step 5: For forecasting, project the trend for the next 96 hours and then add the daily profile (repeated for 4 days).\n\n 9. However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly. We assume the daily pattern will repeat.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n      - Use the last day (2017-10-03) as the base and adjust by the daily profile? But that might not account for the trend.\n\n 11. Given the time constraint and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can use a more straightforward approach: \n      - Use the average of the last 24 hours (2017-10-03) as the daily pattern for the next days, but adjust the level by the trend observed in the last 4 days.\n\n 12. We can compute the daily average for each day and then see the trend in the daily averages.\n\n    Day 1 (2017-09-30): average of 24 points -> let's compute quickly (but we can do programmatically in real scenario, but here we are reasoning)\n        We can approximate: \n        Day1: (9.132+8.813+...+7.889)/24 -> but we don't have to compute exactly for the purpose of the method.\n\n 13. Actually, we are going to provide a forecast. We can use a model that is robust and quick. Since we are an expert, we can use the following:\n\n    We choose to use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, which can handle trend and seasonality. We will set the seasonality to 24 hours.\n\n    Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n        model = ExponentialSmoothing(data, seasonal_periods=24, trend='add', seasonal='add')\n        model_fit = model.fit()\n        forecast = model_fit.forecast(96)\n\n    But note: we are not coding, we are to provide the forecasted values.\n\n 14. However, without running actual code, we must generate the forecast. But the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 15. Since we cannot run code in this environment, we have to simulate the process. We note that the data has:\n    - A downward trend from day1 to day4 (the daily averages are decreasing).\n    - A daily seasonality: low during the day (especially at noon) and higher at night.\n\n 16. We can compute the daily averages for the 4 days:\n\n    Day1 (2017-09-30): \n        Sum = 9.132+8.813+9.310+8.599+8.280+7.391+8.564+10.021+8.066+6.645+4.158+3.696+1.279+1.350+2.843-0.888+1.137+4.442+4.087+4.371+4.087+6.005+6.432+7.889\n        Let me calculate step by step:\n\n        Group:\n        (9: 9.132+8.813+9.310+8.599+8.280+7.391+8.564+10.021+8.066) = \n        9.132+8.813=17.945, +9.310=27.255, +8.599=35.854, +8.280=44.134, +7.391=51.525, +8.564=60.089, +10.021=70.11, +8.066=78.176\n\n        (6.645+4.158+3.696+1.279+1.350+2.843-0.888+1.137) = \n        6.645+4.158=10.803, +3.696=14.499, +1.279=15.778, +1.350=17.128, +2.843=19.971, -0.888=19.083, +1.137=20.22\n\n        (4.442+4.087+4.371+4.087+6.005+6.432+7.889) = \n        4.442+4.087=8.529, +4.371=12.9, +4.087=16.987, +6.005=22.992, +6.432=29.424, +7.889=37.313\n\n        Total = 78.176 + 20.22 + 37.313 = 135.709\n        Average = 135.709 / 24 = 5.6545\n\n    Day2 (2017-10-01): \n        We have: 9.097,9.488,9.630,8.706,9.204,9.061,6.716,6.112,-3.305,-9.808,-12.757,-6.538,-19.580,-6.005,-2.878,0.213,2.487,4.726,4.833,5.259,5.082,7.391,6.787,7.356\n\n        Let me group:\n        First 8: 9.097+9.488+9.630+8.706+9.204+9.061+6.716+6.112 = \n        9.097+9.488=18.585, +9.630=28.215, +8.706=36.921, +9.204=46.125, +9.061=55.186, +6.716=61.902, +6.112=68.014\n\n        Next 8: -3.305-9.808-12.757-6.538-19.580-6.005-2.878+0.213 = \n        (-3.305-9.808=-13.113, -12.757=-25.87, -6.538=-32.408, -19.580=-51.988, -6.005=-57.993, -2.878=-60.871, +0.213=-60.658)\n\n        Last 8: 2.487+4.726+4.833+5.259+5.082+7.391+6.787+7.356 = \n        2.487+4.726=7.213, +4.833=12.046, +5.259=17.305, +5.082=22.387, +7.391=29.778, +6.787=36.565, +7.356=43.921\n\n        Total = 68.014 -60.658 + 43.921 = 51.277\n        Average = 51.277/24 = 2.1365\n\n    Day3 (2017-10-02): \n        Data: 8.102,7.924,8.138,8.138,8.599,7.391,8.102,7.853,6.325,4.584,4.584,5.224,0.675,1.102,2.701,3.127,3.696,4.939,4.584,4.620,3.980,3.589,5.508,5.863\n\n        First 8: 8.102+7.924+8.138+8.138+8.599+7.391+8.102+7.853 = \n        8.102+7.924=16.026, +8.138=24.164, +8.138=32.302, +8.599=40.901, +7.391=48.292, +8.102=56.394, +7.853=64.247\n\n        Next 8: 6.325+4.584+4.584+5.224+0.675+1.102+2.701+3.127 = \n        6.325+4.584=10.909, +4.584=15.493, +5.224=20.717, +0.675=21.392, +1.102=22.494, +2.701=25.195, +3.127=28.322\n\n        Last 8: 3.696+4.939+4.584+4.620+3.980+3.589+5.508+5.863 = \n        3.696+4.939=8.635, +4.584=13.219, +4.620=17.839, +3.980=21.819, +3.589=25.408, +5.508=30.916, +5.863=36.779\n\n        Total = 64.247+28.322+36.779 = 129.348\n        Average = 129.348/24 = 5.3895\n\n    Day4 (2017-10-03): \n        Data: 6.538,6.361,6.041,5.899,4.620,6.787,7.356,6.538,4.655,4.015,3.163,1.670,-1.279,2.168,2.949,1.990,3.482,4.975,4.406,4.548,4.087,4.264,5.721,8.386\n\n        First 8: 6.538+6.361+6.041+5.899+4.620+6.787+7.356+6.538 = \n        6.538+6.361=12.899, +6.041=18.94, +5.899=24.839, +4.620=29.459, +6.787=36.246, +7.356=43.602, +6.538=50.14\n\n        Next 8: 4.655+4.015+3.163+1.670-1.279+2.168+2.949+1.990 = \n        4.655+4.015=8.67, +3.163=11.833, +1.670=13.503, -1.279=12.224, +2.168=14.392, +2.949=17.341, +1.990=19.331\n\n        Last 8: 3.482+4.975+4.406+4.548+4.087+4.264+5.721+8.386 = \n        3.482+4.975=8.457, +4.406=12.863, +4.548=17.411, +4.087=21.498, +4.264=25.762, +5.721=31.483, +8.386=39.869\n\n        Total = 50.14+19.331+39.869 = 109.34\n        Average = 109.34/24 = 4.5558\n\n    The daily averages: [5.6545, 2.1365, 5.3895, 4.5558] -> trend: decreasing then increasing then decreasing? Not a clear linear trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last two days to capture a more recent trend? But the data has a drop on day2 (2017-10-01) which might be an anomaly (Sunday?).\n\n 18. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide the data, we decide to use the following:\n\n    We will use the daily profile from the last day (2017-10-03) and adjust it by the overall trend. But the trend is not clear.\n\n 19. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form the daily profile, and then assume that the next 4 days will have the same daily profile. But we note the overall level might be decreasing. We can adjust by the average of the last 4 days' daily means? \n\n    The overall mean of the entire 96 points: (135.709+51.277+129.348+109.34) = 425.674 / 96 = 4.4347\n\n    The daily profile (average for each hour over 4 days) would be:\n\n        hour0: (9.132+9.097+8.102+6.538)/4 = (9.132+9.097=18.229, +8.102=26.331, +6.538=32.869) /4 = 8.21725\n        ... and so on for each hour.\n\n    Then we can use this daily profile for the next 4 days. But we must adjust the level? The overall level of the next 4 days might be similar to the last 4 days? Or we can project the trend of the daily averages.\n\n 20. The daily averages: \n        Day1: 5.6545\n        Day2: 2.1365\n        Day3: 5.3895\n        Day4: 4.5558\n\n    We can fit a linear trend to these 4 points: \n        x = [1,2,3,4] (days), y = [5.6545, 2.1365, 5.3895, 4.5558]\n\n    The linear regression: \n        slope = (n*sum(xy) - sum(x)*sum(y)) / (n*sum(x^2) - (sum(x))^2)\n        intercept = (sum(y) - slope*sum(x)) / n\n\n        n=4\n        sum(x) = 1+2+3+4 = 10\n        sum(y) = 5.6545+2.1365+5.3895+4.5558 = 17.7363\n        sum(xy) = 1*5.6545 + 2*2.1365 + 3*5.3895 + 4*4.5558 = 5.6545+4.273+16.1685+18.2232 = 44.3192\n        sum(x^2) = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n        slope = (4*44.3192 - 10*17.7363) / (4*30 - 100) = (177.2768 - 177.363) / (120-100) = (-0.0862) / 20 = -0.00431\n        intercept = (17.7363 - (-0.00431)*10) / 4 = (17.7363 + 0.0431) /4 = 17.7794/4 = 4.44485\n\n    So the trend is very slightly negative. The next 4 days (day5,6,7,8) would have daily averages:\n\n        day5: intercept + slope*5 = 4.44485 -0.00431*5 = 4.44485 - 0.02155 = 4.4233\n        day6: 4.44485 -0.00431*6 = 4.44485 - 0.02586 = 4.41899\n        day7: 4.44485 -0.00431*7 = 4.44485 - 0.03017 = 4.41468\n        day8: 4.44485 -0.00431*8 = 4.44485 - 0.03448 = 4.41037\n\n 21. Now, we have the daily profile (average for each hour over the 4 days). Let's call it P_h for hour h (h from 0 to 23). The overall average of the daily profile should be the average of the 4 daily means: (5.6545+2.1365+5.3895+4.5558)/4 = 17.7363/4 = 4.434075.\n\n 22. Then for a given day d (d=5,6,7,8) and hour h, the forecast is:\n\n        F(d,h) = (P_h) * (daily_average_d) / (overall_daily_profile_average)\n\n    But note: we want to scale the daily profile to the projected daily average.\n\n    Alternatively, we can adjust by additive? But we did multiplicative in the above. Actually, we did a multiplicative adjustment. But the trend was additive? \n\n    We have two options: additive or multiplicative adjustment.\n\n    Since the daily profile is the average pattern, and we are projecting the daily level, we can do:\n\n        F(d,h) = P_h + (daily_average_d - overall_daily_profile_average)\n\n    This is additive adjustment.\n\n    But note: the daily profile P_h is the average of the 4 days for hour h. The overall_daily_profile_average is the average of the 4 daily means, which is the same as the average of all 96 points: 4.434075.\n\n    Actually, the average of the daily profile (P_h for h=0..23) is also 4.434075.\n\n    So then:\n\n        F(d,h) = P_h + (daily_average_d - 4.434075)\n\n 23. Let's compute the daily profile P_h for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (9.132+9.097+8.102+6.538)/4 = 32.869/4 = 8.21725\n        hour1: (8.813+9.488+7.924+6.361)/4 = 32.586/4 = 8.1465\n        ... and so on.\n\n    We have to compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 24. But note: the data has 96 points, so we can compute the average for each hour index (0: 00:00, 1:01:00, ... 23:23:00)\n\n    We'll compute P_h for h in 0..23:\n\n        h0: (9.132, 9.097, 8.102, 6.538) -> 8.21725\n        h1: (8.813, 9.488, 7.924, 6.361) -> 8.1465\n        h2: (9.310, 9.630, 8.138, 6.041) -> (9.310+9.630=18.94, +8.138=27.078, +6.041=33.119) -> 8.27975\n        h3: (8.599, 8.706, 8.138, 5.899) -> (8.599+8.706=17.305, +8.138=25.443, +5.899=31.342) -> 7.8355\n        h4: (8.280, 9.204, 8.599, 4.620) -> (8.280+9.204=17.484, +8.599=26.083, +4.620=30.703) -> 7.67575\n        h5: (7.391, 9.061, 7.391, 6.787) -> (7.391+9.061=16.452, +7.391=23.843, +6.787=30.63) -> 7.6575\n        h6: (8.564, 6.716, 8.102, 7.356) -> (8.564+6.716=15.28, +8.102=23.382, +7.356=30.738) -> 7.6845\n        h7: (10.021, 6.112, 7.853, 6.538) -> (10.021+6.112=16.133, +7.853=23.986, +6.538=30.524) -> 7.631\n        h8: (8.066, -3.305, 6.325, 4.655) -> (8.066-3.305=4.761, +6.325=11.086, +4.655=15.741) -> 3.93525\n        h9: (6.645, -9.808, 4.584, 4.015) -> (6.645-9.808=-3.163, +4.584=1.421, +4.015=5.436) -> 1.359\n        h10: (4.158, -12.757, 4.584, 3.163) -> (4.158-12.757=-8.599, +4.584=-4.015, +3.163=-0.852) -> -0.213\n        h11: (3.696, -6.538, 5.224, 1.670) -> (3.696-6.538=-2.842, +5.224=2.382, +1.670=4.052) -> 1.013\n        h12: (1.279, -19.580, 0.675, -1.279) -> (1.279-19.580=-18.301, +0.675=-17.626, -1.279=-18.905) -> -4.72625\n        h13: (1.350, -6.005, 1.102, 2.168) -> (1.350-6.005=-4.655, +1.102=-3.553, +2.168=-1.385) -> -0.34625\n        h14: (2.843, -2.878, 2.701, 2.949) -> (2.843-2.878=-0.035, +2.701=2.666, +2.949=5.615) -> 1.40375\n        h15: (-0.888, 0.213, 3.127, 1.990) -> (-0.888+0.213=-0.675, +3.127=2.452, +1.990=4.442) -> 1.1105\n        h16: (1.137, 2.487, 3.696, 3.482) -> (1.137+2.487=3.624, +3.696=7.32, +3.482=10.802) -> 2.7005\n        h17: (4.442, 4.726, 4.939, 4.975) -> (4.442+4.726=9.168, +4.939=14.107, +4.975=19.082) -> 4.7705\n        h18: (4.087, 4.833, 4.584, 4.406) -> (4.087+4.833=8.92, +4.584=13.504, +4.406=17.91) -> 4.4775\n        h19: (4.371, 5.259, 4.620, 4.548) -> (4.371+5.259=9.63, +4.620=14.25, +4.548=18.798) -> 4.6995\n        h20: (4.087, 5.082, 3.980, 4.087) -> (4.087+5.082=9.169, +3.980=13.149, +4.087=17.236) -> 4.309\n        h21: (6.005, 7.391, 3.589, 4.264) -> (6.005+7.391=13.396, +3.589=16.985, +4.264=21.249) -> 5.31225\n        h22: (6.432, 6.787, 5.508, 5.721) -> (6.432+6.787=13.219, +5.508=18.727, +5.721=24.448) -> 6.112\n        h23: (7.889, 7.356, 5.863, 8.386) -> (7.889+7.356=15.245, +5.863=21.108, +8.386=29.494) -> 7.3735\n\n 25. Now, the overall_daily_profile_average = (sum of P_h for h=0..23)/24 = \n        We can compute: \n        Let me add the P_h:\n\n        8.21725+8.1465+8.27975+7.8355+7.67575+7.6575+7.6845+7.631+3.93525+1.359-0.213+1.013-4.72625-0.34625+1.40375+1.1105+2.7005+4.7705+4.4775+4.6995+4.309+5.31225+6.112+7.3735\n\n        We can group:\n\n        First 8: 8.21725+8.1465=16.36375, +8.27975=24.6435, +7.8355=32.479, +7.67575=40.15475, +7.6575=47.81225, +7.6845=55.49675, +7.631=63.12775\n\n        Next 8: 3.93525+1.359=5.29425, -0.213=5.08125, +1.013=6.09425, -4.72625=1.368, -0.34625=1.02175, +1.40375=2.4255, +1.1105=3.536\n\n        Last 8: 2.7005+4.7705=7.471, +4.4775=11.9485, +4.6995=16.648, +4.309=20.957, +5.31225=26.26925, +6.112=32.38125, +7.3735=39.75475\n\n        Total = 63.12775 + 3.536 + 39.75475 = 106.4185\n\n        But note: the next 8: I have 3.536? Actually, the second group I have 3.536 at the end. Then the last group 39.75475.\n\n        Actually, the second group I computed as 3.536? Let me recalc the second group:\n\n        h8: 3.93525\n        h9: 1.359 -> 3.93525+1.359=5.29425\n        h10: -0.213 -> 5.29425-0.213=5.08125\n        h11: 1.013 -> 5.08125+1.013=6.09425\n        h12: -4.72625 -> 6.09425-4.72625=1.368\n        h13: -0.34625 -> 1.368-0.34625=1.02175\n        h14: 1.40375 -> 1.02175+1.40375=2.4255\n        h15: 1.1105 -> 2.4255+1.1105=3.536\n\n        Then the third group:\n        h16: 2.7005 -> 3.536+2.7005=6.2365? But I did separately. Actually, we are summing all 24.\n\n        So total = 63.12775 (first 8) + 3.536 (next 8? actually next 8 are h8 to h15, which we got 3.536) + 39.75475 (last 8: h16 to h23) = 106.4185\n\n        But wait, the overall average of the entire 96 points we computed earlier as 425.674/96=4.4347. And the average of the daily profile should be the same: 106.4185/24 = 4.4341, which matches.\n\n 26. Now, for the next 4 days (day5 to day8) we have the daily averages: [4.4233, 4.41899, 4.41468, 4.41037]\n\n    For day5 (2017-10-04), the forecast for hour h is:\n        F(5,h) = P_h + (4.4233 - 4.4341) = P_h - 0.0108\n\n    For day6: F(6,h) = P_h + (4.41899 - 4.4341) = P_h - 0.01511\n    For day7: F(7,h) = P_h + (4.41468 - 4.4341) = P_h - 0.01942\n    For day8: F(8,h) = P_h + (4.41037 - 4.4341) = P_h - 0.02373\n\n 27. Now, we can compute the forecast for each hour of the next 96 hours.\n\n    The first 24 hours (2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-04 23:00:00) = day5: \n        h0: 8.21725 - 0.0108 = 8.20645\n        h1: 8.1465 - 0.0108 = 8.1357\n        ... and so on.\n\n    The next 24 hours (2017-10-05) = day6: subtract 0.01511 from P_h\n    Then day7: subtract 0.01942\n    Then day8: subtract 0.02373\n\n 28. We must generate the dates:\n\n    The last date is 2017-10-03 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        2017-10-04 00:00:00\n        2017-10-04 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-10-07 23:00:00\n\n 29. We'll generate the data in the required format.\n\n 30. However, note: the data we are forecasting might be negative? The original data has negative values. So it's acceptable.\n\n 31. Let's write the forecast for the first 3 hours of day5 as an example:\n\n        date: 2017-10-04 00:00:00 -> MUFL = 8.20645\n        date: 2017-10-04 01:00:00 -> 8.1357\n        date: 2017-10-04 02:00:00 -> 8.27975 - 0.0108 = 8.26895\n\n 32. We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 33. But note: the input has up to 3 decimal places? Actually, it has 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n 35. However, to the sheer volume, we will write a program in our mind to generate the 96 points.\n\n    We have P_h for h=0..23 (24 values). Then for each day in the next 4 days (i=0 to 3, representing day5 to day8), we do:\n\n        offset = [ -0.0108, -0.01511, -0.01942, -0.02373 ][i]\n\n        for h in 0..23:\n            value = P_h + offset\n            then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 36.

Actually, 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n 42. We'll generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 43. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the given 96 there are none. We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n 44. We output the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates.\n\n 45.

We'll generate the full list.\n\n 47. However, due to the length, we must be careful. We'll write the first few and last few and then the middle in the code block.\n\n 48. But the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 49. So we write all 96 lines.\n\n 50. We'll do it in the code block below.\n\n 51. Note: We rounded to 3 decimal places by truncating? Actually, we rounded to 3 decimal places by rounding to the nearest thousandth.\n\n    For example: 8.20645 -> 8.206 (because 8.20645 * 1000 = 8206.45, then rounded to 8206, then divided by 1000 -> 8.206)\n\n    But note: 8.20645 is closer to 8.206 than to 8.207? Actually, 8.20645 is 8.206 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n        The rule: look at the 4th decimal: 4 -> round down.\n\n    So 8.20645 rounded to 3 decimals is 8.206.\n\n    Similarly, 8.1357 -> 8.136 (because 8.1357: the 4th decimal is 7, so round up the 3rd decimal: 5 becomes 6).\n\n    We did:\n\n        h0 day5: 8.20645 -> 8.206 (because 8.20645: the 4th decimal is 4 -> round down)\n        h1 day5: 8.1357 -> 8.136 (because 4th decimal is 7 -> round up)\n\n    But in our initial example we wrote 8.136 for h1.\n\n    We must be consistent: we round to 3 decimals.\n\n    value = round(computed_value, 3)\n\n 52. We'll recompute the rounding properly.\n\n    We'll use standard rounding: round to 3 decimals.\n\n    For example:\n\n        h0: 8.20645 -> round(8.20645, 3) = 8.206\n        because 8.20645 * 1000 = 8206.45 -> rounded to integer: 8206 -> 8.206\n\n        h1: 8.1357 -> 8.1357 * 1000 = 8135.7 -> rounded to 8136 -> 8.136\n\n    So we do:\n\n        value = round(computed_value, 3)\n\n 53. We'll adjust the values accordingly.\n\n    We'll recompute the first day5 with rounding:\n\n        h0: 8.20645 -> 8.206\n        h1: 8.1357 -> 8.136\n        h2: 8.26895 -> 8.269\n        h3: 7.8247 -> 7.825\n        h4: 7.66495 -> 7.665\n        h5: 7.6467 -> 7.647\n        h6: 7.6737 -> 7.674\n        h7: 7.6202 -> 7.620\n        h8: 3.92445 -> 3.924\n        h9: 1.3482 -> 1.348\n        h10: -0.2238 -> -0.224\n        h11: 1.0022 -> 1.002\n        h12: -4.73705 -> -4.737\n        h13: -0.35705 -> -0.357\n        h14: 1.39295 -> 1.393\n        h15: 1.0997 -> 1.100\n        h16: 2.6897 -> 2.690\n        h17: 4.7597 -> 4.760\n        h18: 4.4667 -> 4.467\n        h19: 4.6887 -> 4.689\n        h20: 4.2982 -> 4.298\n        h21: 5.30145 -> 5.301\n        h22: 6.1012 -> 6.101\n        h23: 7.3627 -> 7.363\n\n 54. We'll generate the full list accordingly.\n\n 55. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 56. Note: The date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 57. We generate the dates:\n\n        from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00\n\n 58. We'll write the data in the answer block.\n\n 59. Due to the length, we will generate the data in the code block as a fixed string.\n\n 60. We'll create a list of 96 lines.\n\n 61. We'll do:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-10-04 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n    But we don't have pandas, so we do manually:\n\n        day = 4\n        for i in range(96):\n            hour = i % 24\n            day_offset = i // 24\n            current_day = 4 + day_offset\n            date_str = f\"2017-10-{current_day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n    But note: October has 31 days, so from 4 to 7 is safe.\n\n 62. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 63. We have the 4 days of forecast values (each day having 24 values) as computed above (with proper rounding).\n\n 64.
