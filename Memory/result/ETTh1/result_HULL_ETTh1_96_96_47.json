        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we are dealing with a time series that has:\n   - Some seasonality (daily pattern) and possibly a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days).\n 2. We must account for the possibility of missing values in the future? But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? \n    Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided data? But in the provided 96 points, we see no missing.\n    However, the instruction says: \"be aware of that\". So we should handle missing values in the input? But the input we are given is complete.\n\n 3. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we must generate 96 rows with timestamps and forecasted HULL.\n\n Approach for forecasting:\n   - We can use a model that can handle time series with multiple seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we can assume a strong daily seasonality (24 hours).\n   - We can use a model like SARIMA (with seasonality of 24) or Exponential Smoothing (with daily seasonality). However, with only 4 days, the seasonal pattern might not be very stable.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n      - Compute the average of each hour across the 4 days to get a daily profile, and then use that to forecast the next 4 days?\n      - But note: the data shows a pattern that might be changing over the days? Also, the last day (2017-01-08) has a different pattern (with higher values at the beginning).\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 4 days, we can try to model the daily seasonality and a trend.\n\n 6. We'll use a simple average by hour of day for the 4 days and then adjust by the overall level? But the level changes.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the level and then apply the seasonal indices.\n\n 8. However, note that the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a forecast.\n\n 9. We can use the following approach:\n      Step 1: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n      Step 2: Forecast the trend component using a simple method (like linear extrapolation or moving average) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 10. But with only 96 points (4 days) we have limited data.\n\n 11. We can also use the last day's pattern and adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 12. Let's try to compute the daily average for each day:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-01-05): mean = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        Day 2: ...\n        Day 3: ...\n        Day 4: ...\n\n    Then we can compute the average of the 4 days for each hour (so 24 seasonal indices).\n\n 13. Then we can forecast the next 4 days by using the daily indices and the last day's level? Or we can use the average of the last few days? \n\n 14. Since we have a very short history, we can use the overall average of the entire 4 days as the base level and then apply the seasonal indices.\n\n 15. Steps:\n\n      a) Calculate the overall mean (M) of the entire 96 points.\n      b) For each hour of the day (0 to 23), calculate the average of that hour across the 4 days and then subtract M to get the seasonal index (S_h).\n      c) Then the forecast for a particular hour h in the future is: M + S_h.\n\n    But this would give a constant forecast for the same hour every day? And it would be the same for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 16. However, we see that the daily level is changing. So we might want to account for a trend.\n\n 17. We can compute the daily means and then fit a linear regression to the daily means to get a trend. Then for each future day, we can project the daily mean and then add the seasonal index for the hour.\n\n 18. Steps for trend:\n\n      Let D1, D2, D3, D4 be the daily means for the 4 days.\n\n      We can fit a line: y = a + b * t, where t=1,2,3,4 for the days.\n\n      Then for the next 4 days (t=5,6,7,8) we can compute the daily mean.\n\n      Then for a specific hour h in day t (t from 5 to 8), the forecast is: \n          forecast = (a + b*t) + S_h\n\n 19. How to compute S_h? We can compute the seasonal indices as the average deviation from the daily mean for that hour.\n\n      For a given hour h (0-23), let:\n          S_h = (1/4) * [ (value_hour_h_day1 - D1) + (value_hour_h_day2 - D2) + ... ]\n\n      Then the model is: \n          Y_{t,h} = (daily_level_t) + S_h + noise\n\n 20. Let's compute:\n\n      First, split the data into 4 days (each 24 hours).\n\n      Day1: 2017-01-05 -> 24 points\n      Day2: 2017-01-06 -> 24 points\n      Day3: 2017-01-07 -> 24 points\n      Day4: 2017-01-08 -> 24 points\n\n      Compute daily means:\n\n        Day1: D1 = (0.938+1.674+0.469+1.273+0.670+1.139+0.603+0.670+0.000-0.670+0.603+0.603-0.335+0.067+0.000+0.134+0.000-0.067-0.804-1.072-1.407-2.143-0.938-0.134) / 24\n        Let's calculate:\n\n          Sum1 = 0.938+1.674+0.469+1.273+0.670+1.139+0.603+0.670+0.000-0.670+0.603+0.603-0.335+0.067+0.000+0.134+0.000-0.067-0.804-1.072-1.407-2.143-0.938-0.134\n          = (0.938+1.674=2.612) + (0.469+1.273=1.742) -> 4.354 + (0.670+1.139=1.809) -> 6.163 + (0.603+0.670=1.273) -> 7.436 + (0.000-0.670=-0.670) -> 6.766 + (0.603+0.603=1.206) -> 7.972 + (-0.335+0.067=-0.268) -> 7.704 + (0.000+0.134=0.134) -> 7.838 + (0.000-0.067=-0.067) -> 7.771 + (-0.804-1.072=-1.876) -> 5.895 + (-1.407-2.143=-3.55) -> 2.345 + (-0.938-0.134=-1.072) -> 1.273\n\n          D1 = 1.273 / 24?

Let me correct.\n\n 27. Actually, we can compute:\n\n      S = []\n      for h in range(24):\n          total_dev = 0\n          for day in range(4):\n              pos = day*24 + h\n              value = data_values[pos]   # we have the list of 96 values\n              daily_mean = daily_means[day]\n              total_dev += (value - daily_mean)\n          S.append(total_dev / 4)\n\n 28. Then we can generate the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 29. The dates: \n        Start: 2017-01-09 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2017-01-08)\n        Then 2017-01-09 01:00:00, ... until 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll generate 96 points.\n\n 31. Steps for generating:\n\n        day_index = 5,6,7,8 (for the next 4 days, t=5,6,7,8 in our linear trend)\n        for day in range(5,9):   # 5,6,7,8 -> 4 days\n            daily_level = a + b * day\n            for hour in range(24):\n                forecast = daily_level + S[hour]\n                # and then we assign the timestamp: \n                #   base_date = 2017-01-09, then 2017-01-09, 2017-01-10, 2017-01-11, 2017-01-12\n                #   for day5: 2017-01-09? \n                #   How to compute the date of the first day? The last date in the input is 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n                #   So the next day is 2017-01-09.\n\n                # The first forecast point: 2017-01-09 00:00:00\n\n        We can generate the dates = []\n        start_date = pd.Timestamp('2017-01-09 00:00:00')\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + pd.Timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(date)\n\n 32. But note: we are not using pandas in the output, we just need to generate the string representation.\n\n 33. However, we are to output in the same format as the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 34. We'll generate:\n\n        Day5: 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-09 23:00:00\n        Day6: 2017-01-10 ... \n        Day7: 2017-01-11\n        Day8: 2017-01-12\n\n 35. Implementation:\n\n      We have:\n        a = -0.519065\n        b = 0.258417\n\n        daily_means = [0.05304, -0.34046, -0.00842, 0.80375]   # for day1 to day4\n\n        We have the 96 data points in a list: `hull_values`\n\n        We'll compute S for each hour.\n\n 36. But note: we must be cautious with floating point precision.\n\n 37. Alternatively, we can do the computation in code (if we were coding) but here we are to write the answer.\n\n 38. Since it's a lot, we can write a small program in our mind and then output the forecast.\n\n 39. However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 40. We decide to compute the 24 seasonal indices first.\n\n 41. Let me compute S for each hour (0 to 23) by hand? It's tedious but we can do a few and then write a script? But we are to provide the answer.\n\n 42. Alternatively, we can use a more straightforward method: since the data is small, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days without detrending? \n     But we did detrend by removing the daily mean.\n\n 43. We'll compute the seasonal indices S_h for h=0:\n        values: [0.938, 0.268, -0.536, 2.210] \n        daily_means: [0.05304, -0.34046, -0.00842, 0.80375]\n        deviations: \n            0.938 - 0.05304 = 0.88496\n            0.268 - (-0.34046) = 0.60846\n            -0.536 - (-0.00842) = -0.52758\n            2.210 - 0.80375 = 1.40625\n        S0 = (0.88496+0.60846-0.52758+1.40625)/4 = (0.88496+0.60846=1.49342; 1.49342-0.52758=0.96584; 0.96584+1.40625=2.37209) -> 4 -> 0.5930225\n\n for h=1:\n        values: [1.674, -0.201, -0.335, 1.340]\n        deviations:\n            1.674 - 0.05304 = 1.62096\n            -0.201 - (-0.34046) = 0.13946\n            -0.335 - (-0.00842) = -0.32658\n            1.340 - 0.80375 = 0.53625\n        S1 = (1.62096+0.13946-0.32658+0.53625)/4 = (1.62096+0.13946=1.76042; 1.76042-0.32658=1.43384; 1.43384+0.53625=1.97009) -> 1.97009/4=0.4925225\n\n for h=2:\n        values: [0.469, -0.402, -0.134, 0.938]\n        deviations:\n            0.469 - 0.05304 = 0.41596\n            -0.402 - (-0.34046) = -0.06154\n            -0.134 - (-0.00842) = -0.12558\n            0.938 - 0.80375 = 0.13425\n        S2 = (0.41596 -0.06154 -0.12558 +0.13425)/4 = (0.41596-0.06154=0.35442; 0.35442-0.12558=0.22884; 0.22884+0.13425=0.36309) -> 0.36309/4=0.0907725\n\n for h=3:\n        values: [1.273, -0.402, 0.134, 2.009]\n        deviations:\n            1.273 - 0.05304 = 1.21996\n            -0.402 - (-0.34046) = -0.06154\n            0.134 - (-0.00842) = 0.14242\n            2.009 - 0.80375 = 1.20525\n        S3 = (1.21996 -0.06154 +0.14242 +1.20525)/4 = (1.21996-0.06154=1.15842; 1.15842+0.14242=1.30084; 1.30084+1.20525=2.50609) -> 2.50609/4=0.6265225\n\n ... this is very time-consuming.\n\n 44. We can write a small code in our mind and then output the seasonal indices? But we are to output the forecasted values.\n\n 45. Alternatively, we can use a different method: since the data is small, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour without detrending? \n     But that would be the same as the method we described without trend? \n\n 46. We decide to use the method without trend? But we see a trend in the daily means.\n\n 47. We'll do the computation for all 24 hours and then generate the 96 forecasted values.\n\n 48. We'll compute the seasonal indices S_h for h=0..23:\n\n        S = 0.5930225, 0.4925225, 0.0907725, 0.6265225, ... \n\n 49. We'll compute the rest similarly? But due to the length, we might make a mistake.\n\n 50. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the hour across the 4 days? That is, without removing the daily mean? \n        Then we would have: for hour0: (0.938+0.268-0.536+2.210)/4 = (0.938+0.268=1.206; 1.206-0.536=0.67; 0.67+2.210=2.88) -> 2.88/4=0.72\n        Then we would use this as the expected value for hour0? But then we would not account for the daily level.\n\n 51. We stick to our initial plan: remove the daily mean to get the seasonal indices, then add the projected daily level.\n\n 52. We'll compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours:\n\n        S = []\n        data = [ list of 96 values in order ]\n\n        daily_means = [0.05304, -0.34046, -0.00842, 0.80375]\n\n        for h in range(24):\n            devs = []\n            for d in range(4):\n                idx = d*24+h\n                dev = data[idx] - daily_means[d]\n                devs.append(dev)\n            S.append(sum(devs)/4)\n\n 53. We do this computationally in our mind? It's error-prone.\n\n 54. We decide to output the forecast by generating the 96 values using the method, but we hope the seasonal indices are computed correctly.\n\n 55. We'll do it in code in our environment? But we are an AI and can simulate.\n\n 56. Let me simulate the computation of S:\n\n        data = [\n        # day1\n        0.938,1.674,0.469,1.273,0.670,1.139,0.603,0.670,0.000,-0.670,0.603,0.603,-0.335,0.067,0.000,0.134,0.000,-0.067,-0.804,-1.072,-1.407,-2.143,-0.938,-0.134,\n        # day2\n        0.268,-0.201,-0.402,-0.402,0.000,0.134,0.000,-0.201,0.067,0.603,0.603,0.603,-0.268,0.201,0.335,0.000,-0.670,-0.871,-1.541,-1.674,-1.808,-2.143,-0.603,-0.201,\n        # day3\n        -0.536,-0.335,-0.134,0.134,0.000,-0.067,0.134,-0.201,0.737,0.536,0.134,0.670,-0.134,-0.067,0.536,0.603,0.000,-0.536,-1.139,-0.469,-0.603,-1.474,-0.067,2.076,\n        # day4\n        2.210,1.340,0.938,2.009,1.942,2.076,1.139,1.875,1.674,1.541,1.541,1.407,0.067,0.670,0.402,0.938,0.402,0.000,-0.603,-0.737,-0.871,-0.938,0.000,0.268\n        ]\n\n        daily_means = [0.05304, -0.34046, -0.00842, 0.80375]\n\n        S = [0]*24\n        for h in range(24):\n            total = 0\n            for d in range(4):\n                idx = d*24 + h\n                total += data[idx] - daily_means[d]\n            S[h] = total / 4\n\n        Then we get S for each hour.\n\n 57. We'll assume we have computed S as:\n\n        S = [ \n          0.5930225, 0.4925225, 0.0907725, 0.6265225, \n          ... we need to compute all\n        ]\n\n 58. Due to the length, we are to provide the full computation, we can do it in a program. But since we are to output the forecast, we can skip showing S and directly output the forecasted values.\n\n 59. We'll generate the 96 forecasted values:\n\n        t=5: daily_level5 = 0.77302\n        for h in 0..23: value = 0.77302 + S[h]\n\n        t=6: daily_level6 = 1.031437\n        for h in 0..23: value = 1.031437 + S[h]\n\n        t=7: daily_level7 = 1.289854\n        for h in 0..23: value = 1.289854 + S[h]\n\n        t=8: daily_level8 = 1.548271\n        for h in 0..23: value = 1.548271 + S[h]\n\n 60. We must compute S for each hour. Let's do it for the first few and then we can do the rest similarly.\n\n 61.

We must generate 96 points. We'll do the same for day6, day7, day8.\n\n 67. We'll output the data in the required format.\n\n 68. The dates:\n\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00\n        2017-01-09 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-01-09 23:00:00\n        2017-01-10 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-01-12 23:00:00\n\n 69. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 70. Given the complexity and potential for rounding error, we do the computation and round.\n\n 71. We'll generate the 96 values.\n\n 72. Due to the length, we might make a mistake in manual calculation, but we are to provide the answer.\n\n 73. We decide to output the forecast for the next 96 hours.\n\n 74. We'll write a text representation.\n\n 75. We must be cautious: the seasonal indices we computed might have rounding errors from the daily means.\n\n 76. We use the daily means we computed (with 5 decimal places) and the seasonal indices (with 7 decimal places) and then round the final forecast to 3 decimal places.\n\n 77. We generate the first day (2017-01-09) and then the next days similarly.\n\n 78. We'll do it for the first day and then the rest similarly.\n\n 79. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-09 00:00:00  1.366\n2017-01-09 01:00:00  1.266\n...\n```\n\n 80. We must generate 96 lines.\n\n 81. Given the length, we might use a program to generate, but we are to provide the answer.\n\n 82. We'll generate the first few and then the last few for brevity in thinking, but the problem requires complete data.\n\n 83. We decide to trust the method and provide the full 96 values by simulating the computation.\n\n 84. We'll do it systematically.\n\n 85. We have:\n\n        S = [0.5930225, 0.4925225, 0.0907725, 0.6265225, 0.5260225, 0.6935225, 0.3420225, 0.4087725, 0.4925225, 0.3755225, 0.5932725, 0.6937725, -0.2944775, 0.0907725, 0.1912725, 0.2917725, -0.1939775, -0.4954775, -1.1487275, -1.1149775, -1.2992275, -1.8014775, -0.5289775, 0.3752725]\n\n        levels = [0.77302, 1.031437, 1.289854, 1.548271]\n\n 86. Then for day5 (index0 in levels), hours0-23: level0 + S_h, then for day6: level1 + S_h, etc.\n\n 87. We'll generate the 96 points.\n\n 88. We'll round each forecast to 3 decimal places.\n\n 89. Example: 1.3660425 -> 1.366, 90. Let's do it.\n\n 91. We generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 92. We output in the required answer format.\n\n 93. Given the length, we might make a mistake, but we do our best.\n\n 94. We start from 2017-01-09 00:00:00.\n\n 95.
