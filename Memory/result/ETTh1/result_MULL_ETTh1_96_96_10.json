        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any missing values in the given segment.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be prepared. But in the provided past 96 points, there are no missing values.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 future time points.\n\n 3. We must choose a method for time series forecasting. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the hourly frequency, we can consider:\n    - The data shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours). For example, on each day, the load drops around 9:00 and then recovers, and also has a lot of variation.\n\n 4. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we have 24 hours in a day, the seasonal period is 24.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we can use a simple seasonal decomposition or a model like SARIMA. However, with only 96 points, we can also use a naive seasonal method.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model with seasonality (Holt-Winters). But note: we have to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history.\n\n 7. However, the data does not show a clear trend but does show seasonality. We can try to compute the seasonal indices and then project.\n\n 8. Approach:\n    - We have 4 days of data. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n    - But note: the data might have a level shift? We can also adjust by the last day's overall level.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day 4) as the base and then adjust by the seasonal component? \n\n 10. Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none, we can use the available data to compute the seasonal pattern.\n\n 11. Let's compute the hourly averages for the 4 days we have. We have 4 observations for each hour (e.g., 00:00 on 4 different days). Then we can use these averages as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 12. However, we note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level of each day:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-08-10): average = (4.904+4.762+...+2.239)/24 = ?\n        We can compute:\n\n        But note: the data for each day is 24 points. We can compute the daily average.\n\n        Day1: 2016-08-10: \n            We can calculate: \n            sum = 4.904+4.762+5.259+4.975+4.655+4.833+4.939+5.330+4.797+1.706+3.269+3.127+2.914+2.843+3.873+3.127+3.553+3.802+2.878+2.701+1.564+1.812+2.168+2.239\n            = 85.29 (approx) -> average = 85.29/24 = 3.55375\n\n        Day2: 2016-08-11: \n            = 4.300+4.158+4.371+4.691+4.300+3.873+4.122+3.838+3.696+3.518+3.305+1.954+3.340+2.878+3.269+3.198+3.767+3.020+0.675+2.061+2.061+2.097+2.985+3.980\n            = 78.358 -> average = 78.358/24 = 3.2649\n\n        Day3: 2016-08-12:\n            = 3.482+3.234+3.269+4.797+4.939+3.909+3.909+4.193+3.909+5.117+3.767+3.376+3.092+3.447+3.020+3.163+2.949+2.949+3.056+3.056+1.777+0.853+4.442+3.234\n            = 80.13 -> average = 80.13/24 = 3.33875\n\n        Day4: 2016-08-13:\n            = 3.127+3.056+2.203+3.305+2.701+2.594+1.599+2.416+2.914+4.087+3.980+3.625+3.802+3.838+3.518+3.198+3.234+3.305+3.340+3.553+4.087+4.264+2.239+2.452\n            = 74.335 -> average = 74.335/24 = 3.09729\n\n        The daily averages are: 3.55, 3.26, 3.34, 3.10 -> showing a downward trend? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 13. We can use a simple method: \n        Forecast = (last day's average) * (seasonal index for the hour) / (overall average of the last day's seasonals)\n\n    But note: we are going to use the seasonal indices computed from the entire 4 days? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour as the seasonal pattern, and then adjust by the level of the last day? \n\n    Let S_h be the average for hour h over the 4 days.\n\n    Then the forecast for hour h of the next day (day5) = S_h * (level adjustment)\n\n    How to adjust the level? We can use the last day's average relative to the overall seasonal average? \n\n    Overall average of the 4 days: (3.55375+3.2649+3.33875+3.09729)/4 = 3.3136725\n\n    The last day's average is 3.09729, which is below the overall average.\n\n    We can compute the seasonal indices without level adjustment? \n\n 15. Another simple method: use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days as the forecast for that hour in the next 4 days? \n\n    But note: we have 4 days, so for the next 24 hours (day5) we can use the average of the same hour from day1 to day4.\n\n    Then for the next day (day6) we use the same averages? So the next 4 days will be the same as the first 4 days? \n\n    However, we see a downward trend? But we don't have enough data to confirm a trend.\n\n 16. Given the ambiguity, we are required to forecast 96 points (4 days). We can use the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a daily pattern and then repeat it for 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n        - Then the forecast for the next 4 days is the same daily pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 17. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (4.904 + 4.300 + 3.482 + 3.127) / 4 = 15.813/4 = 3.95325\n        hour1: (4.762+4.158+3.234+3.056)/4 = 15.21/4 = 3.8025\n        hour2: (5.259+4.371+3.269+2.203)/4 = 15.102/4 = 3.7755\n        hour3: (4.975+4.691+4.797+3.305)/4 = 17.768/4 = 4.442\n        hour4: (4.655+4.300+4.939+2.701)/4 = 16.595/4 = 4.14875\n        hour5: (4.833+3.873+3.909+2.594)/4 = 15.209/4 = 3.80225\n        hour6: (4.939+4.122+3.909+1.599)/4 = 14.569/4 = 3.64225\n        hour7: (5.330+3.838+4.193+2.416)/4 = 15.777/4 = 3.94425\n        hour8: (4.797+3.696+3.909+2.914)/4 = 15.316/4 = 3.829\n        hour9: (1.706+3.518+5.117+4.087)/4 = 14.428/4 = 3.607\n        hour10: (3.269+3.305+3.767+3.980)/4 = 14.321/4 = 3.58025\n        hour11: (3.127+1.954+3.376+3.625)/4 = 12.082/4 = 3.0205\n        hour12: (2.914+3.340+3.092+3.802)/4 = 13.148/4 = 3.287\n        hour13: (2.843+2.878+3.447+3.838)/4 = 13.006/4 = 3.2515\n        hour14: (3.873+3.269+3.020+3.518)/4 = 13.68/4 = 3.42\n        hour15: (3.127+3.198+3.163+3.198)/4? Wait, let me check the data for day4 hour15: 3.198? Actually:\n\n        Correction: \n        Day1 hour15: 3.127\n        Day2 hour15: 3.198\n        Day3 hour15: 3.163\n        Day4 hour15: 3.198? Actually, the data for day4 hour15 is 3.198? \n\n        But in the data for day4: \n        2016-08-13 15:00:00 3.198 -> yes.\n\n        So hour15: (3.127+3.198+3.163+3.198)/4 = 12.686/4 = 3.1715\n\n        hour16: (3.553+3.767+2.949+3.234)/4 = 13.503/4 = 3.37575\n        hour17: (3.802+3.020+2.949+3.305)/4 = 13.076/4 = 3.269\n        hour18: (2.878+0.675+3.056+3.340)/4 = 9.949/4 = 2.48725\n        hour19: (2.701+2.061+3.056+3.553)/4 = 11.371/4 = 2.84275\n        hour20: (1.564+2.061+1.777+4.087)/4 = 9.489/4 = 2.37225\n        hour21: (1.812+2.097+0.853+4.264)/4 = 9.026/4 = 2.2565\n        hour22: (2.168+2.985+4.442+2.239)/4 = 11.834/4 = 2.9585\n        hour23: (2.239+3.980+3.234+2.452)/4 = 11.905/4 = 2.97625\n\n 18. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-14 to 2016-08-17) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-08-14): \n            00:00: 3.95325\n            01:00: 3.8025\n            ... until 23:00: 2.97625\n\n        Day2 (2016-08-15): same as above\n        Day3 (2016-08-16): same\n        Day4 (2016-08-17): same\n\n 19. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the past, but for the forecast we are generating, we are not missing any.\n\n 20. We must generate 96 points. We'll create the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-14 00:00:00, then hourly until 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n 21. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, with the date and the MULL value.\n\n 22. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n 23. However, note that the data we have is from 4 days, and we are repeating the same pattern. This is a simple and reasonable approach given the very limited history.\n\n 24. Let's generate the data:\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n        The values for each day are the hourly averages we computed above.\n\n 25. We'll create a list:\n\n        date: starting at 2016-08-14 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n        MULL: \n            hour0: 3.95325\n            hour1: 3.8025\n            hour2: 3.7755\n            hour3: 4.442\n            hour4: 4.14875\n            hour5: 3.80225\n            hour6: 3.64225\n            hour7: 3.94425\n            hour8: 3.829\n            hour9: 3.607\n            hour10: 3.58025\n            hour11: 3.0205\n            hour12: 3.287\n            hour13: 3.2515\n            hour14: 3.42\n            hour15: 3.1715\n            hour16: 3.37575\n            hour17: 3.269\n            hour18: 2.48725\n            hour19: 2.84275\n            hour20: 2.37225\n            hour21: 2.2565\n            hour22: 2.9585\n            hour23: 2.97625\n\n        And then repeat this same list for the next 3 days.\n\n 26. We'll output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-14 00:00:00 3.953\n2016-08-14 01:00:00 3.803\n...\n2016-08-17 23:00:00 2.976\n```\n\n        We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 27. But note: the input had 3 decimal places. We'll round our computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: round(3.95325, 3) -> 3.953\n        hour1: 3.8025 -> 3.803 (if we round to 3 decimals: 3.803 because 3.8025 rounds to 3.803? \n                Actually, 3.8025 is exactly halfway, and we round to even? But typically in such cases we round to 3.803.\n\n        However, let's check: \n            The input data has values like 4.904, 4.762, etc. They are given to 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places using standard rounding (round half up).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use: \n            value = round(x, 3)\n\n        But note: the rounding method in Python for 3.8025: \n            Python 3 rounds to the nearest even? \n            Actually, in financial and engineering contexts, we often round half up.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify. We'll use the standard rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll compute each hourly average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 28. Let me recalculate the hourly averages and round:\n\n        hour0: (4.904+4.300+3.482+3.127)/4 = (15.813)/4 = 3.95325 -> 3.953\n        hour1: (4.762+4.158+3.234+3.056)/4 = 15.21/4 = 3.8025 -> 3.803\n        hour2: (5.259+4.371+3.269+2.203)/4 = 15.102/4 = 3.7755 -> 3.776\n        hour3: (4.975+4.691+4.797+3.305)/4 = 17.768/4 = 4.442 -> 4.442\n        hour4: (4.655+4.300+4.939+2.701)/4 = 16.595/4 = 4.14875 -> 4.149\n        hour5: (4.833+3.873+3.909+2.594)/4 = 15.209/4 = 3.80225 -> 3.802\n        hour6: (4.939+4.122+3.909+1.599)/4 = 14.569/4 = 3.64225 -> 3.642\n        hour7: (5.330+3.838+4.193+2.416)/4 = 15.777/4 = 3.94425 -> 3.944\n        hour8: (4.797+3.696+3.909+2.914)/4 = 15.316/4 = 3.829 -> 3.829\n        hour9: (1.706+3.518+5.117+4.087)/4 = 14.428/4 = 3.607 -> 3.607\n        hour10: (3.269+3.305+3.767+3.980)/4 = 14.321/4 = 3.58025 -> 3.580\n        hour11: (3.127+1.954+3.376+3.625)/4 = 12.082/4 = 3.0205 -> 3.021\n        because 3.0205 rounded to 3 decimals: 3.021 (since the 4th decimal is 5, we round up the 3rd decimal from 0 to 1)\n        hour12: (2.914+3.340+3.092+3.802)/4 = 13.148/4 = 3.287 -> 3.287\n        hour13: (2.843+2.878+3.447+3.838)/4 = 13.006/4 = 3.2515 -> 3.252\n        hour14: (3.873+3.269+3.020+3.518)/4 = 13.68/4 = 3.42 -> 3.420\n        hour15: (3.127+3.198+3.163+3.198)/4 = 12.686/4 = 3.1715 -> 3.172\n        hour16: (3.553+3.767+2.949+3.234)/4 = 13.503/4 = 3.37575 -> 3.376\n        hour17: (3.802+3.020+2.949+3.305)/4 = 13.076/4 = 3.269 -> 3.269\n        hour18: (2.878+0.675+3.056+3.340)/4 = 9.949/4 = 2.48725 -> 2.487\n        hour19: (2.701+2.061+3.056+3.553)/4 = 11.371/4 = 2.84275 -> 2.843\n        hour20: (1.564+2.061+1.777+4.087)/4 = 9.489/4 = 2.37225 -> 2.372\n        hour21: (1.812+2.097+0.853+4.264)/4 = 9.026/4 = 2.2565 -> 2.257\n        because 2.2565 -> 2.257\n        hour22: (2.168+2.985+4.442+2.239)/4 = 11.834/4 = 2.9585 -> 2.959\n        hour23: (2.239+3.980+3.234+2.452)/4 = 11.905/4 = 2.97625 -> 2.976\n\n 29. So the daily pattern:\n\n        hour0: 3.953\n        hour1: 3.803\n        hour2: 3.776\n        hour3: 4.442\n        hour4: 4.149\n        hour5: 3.802\n        hour6: 3.642\n        hour7: 3.944\n        hour8: 3.829\n        hour9: 3.607\n        hour10: 3.580\n        hour11: 3.021\n        hour12: 3.287\n        hour13: 3.252\n        hour14: 3.420\n        hour15: 3.172\n        hour16: 3.376\n        hour17: 3.269\n        hour18: 2.487\n        hour19: 2.843\n        hour20: 2.372\n        hour21: 2.257\n        hour22: 2.959\n        hour23: 2.976\n\n 30. Now we write the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2016-08-14: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> the above 24 values in order.\n        Day2: 2016-08-15: same 24 values.\n        Day3: 2016-08-16: same.\n        Day4: 2016-08-17: same.\n\n 31. We generate the dates:\n\n        We start at 2016-08-14 00:00:00, then 2016-08-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-14 23:00:00.\n        Then 2016-08-15 00:00:00 ... until 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-14 00:00:00 3.953\n2016-08-14 01:00:00 3.803\n2016-08-14 02:00:00 3.776\n2016-08-14 03:00:00 4.442\n2016-08-14 04:00:00 4.149\n2016-08-14 05:00:00 3.802\n2016-08-14 06:00:00 3.642\n2016-08-14 07:00:00 3.944\n2016-08-14 08:00:00 3.829\n2016-08-14 09:00:00 3.607\n2016-08-14 10:00:00 3.580\n2016-08-14 11:00:00 3.021\n2016-08-14 12:00:00 3.287\n2016-08-14 13:00:00 3.252\n2016-08-14 14:00:00 3.420\n2016-08-14 15:00:00 3.172\n2016-08-14 16:00:00 3.376\n2016-08-14 17:00:00 3.269\n2016-08-14 18:00:00 2.487\n2016-08-14 19:00:00 2.843\n2016-08-14 20:00:00 2.372\n2016-08-14 21:00:00 2.257\n2016-08-14 22:00:00 2.959\n2016-08-14 23:00:00 2.976\n2016-08-15 00:00:00 3.953\n... and so on.\n\n 33. We'll write a loop for 4 days, and for 24 hours.\n\n 34. But note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 35. We'll generate the dates = []\n values = []\n\n for day in range(4):\n     for hour in range(24):\n         date_str = (start_date + day * 24 hours + hour * 1 hour) \n\n 36. Start date: 2016-08-14 00:00:00\n\n 37. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 38. We must be careful: the next day after 2016-08-13 is 2016-08-14.\n\n 39. We output the data.\n\n 40. Since the problem requires the complete data and we are not missing any, we output 96 points.\n\n 41. We'll write the rounded values as above.\n\n 42. Let's code the output.\n\n 43. We note: the last given date was 2016-08-13 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-08-14 00:00:00.\n\n 44. We'll generate:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016, 8, 14, 0, 0, 0)\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            value = pattern[i % 24]\n\n 45. The pattern list (24 values) as computed above.\n\n 46. We write the pattern list:\n\n        pattern = [\n            3.953, 3.803, 3.776, 4.442, 4.149, 3.802, 3.642, 3.944, \n            3.829, 3.607, 3.580, 3.021, 3.287, 3.252, 3.420, 3.172, \n            3.376, 3.269, 2.487, 2.843, 2.372, 2.257, 2.959, 2.976\n        ]\n\n 47. Then we generate 4 days of this pattern.\n\n 48. We output in the required format.\n\n 49. We write the answer in the <answer> block.\n\n 50. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 51. We output 96 lines.\n\n 52. Let's write the answer.\n",
