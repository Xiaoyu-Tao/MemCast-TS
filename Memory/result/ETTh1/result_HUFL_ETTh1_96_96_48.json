        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data size is small (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points ahead, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal methods: The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n    - However, with only 4 days of data, it's challenging to capture weekly patterns, but we can try to capture daily patterns.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we are not allowed to use external libraries for complex models, but we are to provide the forecast.\n\n Since the problem requires a complete set of 96 forecasted values and we are in a simulated environment, we can use a simple method:\n\n Approach:\n  - We'll use a seasonal naive method: each hour in the next day is the same as the same hour in the last available day (2017-01-12) or average of the same hour over the 4 days?\n  - However, looking at the data, there is a pattern that repeats daily but with variations.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n  Example for 00:00:00:\n    Day1 (09): 12.324\n    Day2 (10): 12.324\n    Day3 (11): 12.659\n    Day4 (12): 11.721\n    Average = (12.324 + 12.324 + 12.659 + 11.721) / 4 = 12.257\n\n  Then for the next 4 days at 00:00:00, we would use 12.257? But that would be the same for each day? We want 4 different days.\n\n  Instead, we can use a moving window or exponential smoothing. However, the problem does not specify the method.\n\n  Considering the requirement for 96 points and the simplicity, we can do:\n\n  For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n\n  Then, for the next 4 days, we use that same average for each hour? But that would make each day identical.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-01-12) as the pattern for the next 4 days? That would be a naive seasonal forecast with seasonality=24.\n\n  However, note that the data shows a trend? Let's see:\n\n  The data for the same hour across days:\n\n  00:00: \n      09: 12.324\n      10: 12.324\n      11: 12.659\n      12: 11.721 -> slightly decreasing?\n\n  Without more data, it's hard to capture a trend. \n\n  Given the instructions, we are to provide the forecast. We choose:\n\n  Method: Seasonal Naive (using the last day's pattern for the next 4 days)\n\n  Why? \n    - It's simple and often works well for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n    - We have exactly 4 days, so we can use the 4th day (2017-01-12) as the template for the next 4 days.\n\n  But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data? In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n  However, the next 96 points are to be generated. We are to output 96 lines of data, starting from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n  We will set:\n     2017-01-13 00:00:00: same as 2017-01-12 00:00:00 -> 11.721\n     2017-01-13 01:00:00: same as 2017-01-12 01:00:00 -> 10.851\n     ... until\n     2017-01-13 23:00:00: same as 2017-01-12 23:00:00 -> 12.525\n\n  Then for 2017-01-14, we use the same pattern again: 11.721, 10.851, ... 12.525.\n\n  But wait, that would be 4 identical days? The problem says \"next 96 recorded dates\", which is 4 days. So we repeat the last day 4 times?\n\n  However, that might not be the best. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for each hour? Then each day in the forecast would be the same? That would be a flat daily pattern.\n\n  Another idea: use the last day (2017-01-12) and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n  Given the simplicity and the requirement, I choose the seasonal naive method for the next day and then use that same day for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 identical days.\n\n  Actually, the standard seasonal method for 24-hour seasonality is to use:\n\n     y_{t+24} = y_t   (if we are at the same time next day)\n\n  But we are forecasting 96 steps ahead. We can do:\n\n     For the first 24 hours (day 5: 2017-01-13) we use the 24 hours of day 4 (2017-01-12).\n     For day 6 (2017-01-14): we use day 4 again? or day 5? But we don't have day5.\n\n  Since we are forecasting all 96 at once, we can only rely on the available data.\n\n  We can do:\n\n     Day5 (2017-01-13) = Day4 (2017-01-12)\n     Day6 (2017-01-14) = Day3 (2017-01-11)  -> but that would be two days before? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? Then each day in the forecast is the same averaged day? \n\n  Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n  Hour 0: (12.324 + 12.324 + 12.659 + 11.721) / 4 = (12.324+12.324=24.648; 24.648+12.659=37.307; 37.307+11.721=49.028) -> 49.028/4 = 12.257\n  Hour 1: (11.855 + 9.779 + 11.922 + 10.851) / 4 = (11.855+9.779=21.634; 21.634+11.922=33.556; 33.556+10.851=44.407) -> 44.407/4 = 11.10175\n  ... and so on.\n\n  Then for each day in the forecast, we use the same 24 averages? So the forecast for the next 4 days would be 4 identical days, each with the 24 averaged values.\n\n  This method is called: seasonal average.\n\n  Which one is better? \n\n  Given the data shows some variation, and we don't see a clear trend, the average might be more stable.\n\n  However, note that the last day (2017-01-12) might be the most recent and hence more relevant. \n\n  Considering the trade-off, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the recent days? \n\n  But the problem does not specify. We must choose one.\n\n  I choose the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form a typical day, and then use that typical day for each of the next 4 days.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    For hour in 0..23:\n        values = [ value at that hour from day1, day2, day3, day4 ]\n        avg = mean(values)\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, each day will have the same 24 averages.\n\n  This will produce 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n  Let's compute the averages:\n\n  We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n  We have:\n\n      Day1: 2017-01-09\n      Day2: 2017-01-10\n      Day3: 2017-01-11\n      Day4: 2017-01-12\n\n  We'll index the hour by the hour of day (0 to 23).\n\n  Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n      Day1: 12.324\n      Day2: 12.324\n      Day3: 12.659\n      Day4: 11.721\n      avg0 = (12.324 + 12.324 + 12.659 + 11.721) / 4 = 12.257\n\n  hour1 (01:00:00):\n      Day1: 11.855\n      Day2: 9.779\n      Day3: 11.922\n      Day4: 10.851\n      avg1 = (11.855 + 9.779 + 11.922 + 10.851) / 4 = 11.10175\n\n  We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n  Then the forecast for:\n      2017-01-13 00:00:00: 12.257\n      2017-01-13 01:00:00: 11.10175\n      ... \n      2017-01-13 23:00:00: [avg for hour23]\n\n  Then 2017-01-14 00:00:00: 12.257 (same as 2017-01-13 00:00:00)\n       2017-01-14 01:00:00: 11.10175\n       ... and so on.\n\n  We'll compute the 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n  Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n  We'll create a list for each hour index (0-23) and then the average.\n\n  We'll write a small code in mind:\n\n      hour0: [12.324, 12.324, 12.659, 11.721] -> 12.257\n      hour1: [11.855, 9.779, 11.922, 10.851] -> 11.10175\n      hour2: [10.114, 9.310, 11.855, 12.726] ->

(13.195+10.851+11.989+12.525)/4 = 12.14\n\n  Now, we have 24 values:\n\n      [12.257, 11.10175, 10.75125, 11.43675, 10.64975, 10.76725, 12.00625, 12.2575, 11.90575, 10.44875, 9.712, 10.26475,

and HUFL.\n\n  We must round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n  So we round each forecasted value to 3 decimal places.\n\n  Example: 12.257 -> 12.257, 11.10175 -> 11.102 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n  Let's round:\n\n      hour0: 12.257 -> 12.257\n      hour1: 11.10175 -> 11.102\n      hour2: 10.75125 -> 10.751\n      hour3: 11.43675 -> 11.437\n      hour4: 10.64975 -> 10.650\n      hour5: 10.76725 -> 10.767\n      hour6: 12.00625 -> 12.006\n      hour7: 12.2575 -> 12.258 (because 12.2575 rounded to 3 decimals: 12.258)\n      hour8: 11.90575 -> 11.906\n      hour9: 10.44875 -> 10.449\n      hour10: 9.712 -> 9.712\n      hour11: 10.26475 -> 10.265\n      hour12: 6.51375 -> 6.514\n      hour13: 6.581 -> 6.581\n      hour14: 7.7865 -> 7.787 (since 7.7865 -> 7.787 when rounded to 3 decimals: because 6 is followed by 5, so round up the 6 to 7)\n      hour15: 7.23375 -> 7.234\n      hour16: 8.3725 -> 8.373 (because 8.3725 -> 8.373? Actually, 8.3725 is exactly halfway: rounding to nearest even? but in practice, we round up -> 8.373)\n      hour17: 10.8845 -> 10.885 (round up the 4 to 5 because next digit is 5)\n      hour18: 10.73375 -> 10.734\n      hour19: 11.10225 -> 11.102\n      hour20: 10.583 -> 10.583\n      hour21: 9.9465 -> 9.947\n      hour22: 10.9345 -> 10.935\n      hour23: 12.14 -> 12.140\n\n  But note: 12.14 is 12.140 -> so we write 12.140.\n\n  However, the input had trailing zeros? The input had 12.324, 11.855, etc. So we output 3 decimal places.\n\n  We'll format each number to have 3 decimal places.\n\n  Now, we write the data:\n\n      First day: 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-13 23:00:00: the 24 values above (in order) rounded to 3 decimals.\n      Then repeat the same 24 values for the next three days.\n\n  Let's create the list of 24 rounded values:\n\n      hour0: 12.257\n      hour1: 11.102\n      hour2: 10.751\n      hour3: 11.437\n      hour4: 10.650\n      hour5: 10.767\n      hour6: 12.006\n      hour7: 12.258\n      hour8: 11.906\n      hour9: 10.449\n      hour10: 9.712\n      hour11: 10.265\n      hour12: 6.514\n      hour13: 6.581\n      hour14: 7.787\n      hour15: 7.234\n      hour16: 8.373\n      hour17: 10.885\n      hour18: 10.734\n      hour19: 11.102\n      hour20: 10.583\n      hour21: 9.947\n      hour22: 10.935\n      hour23: 12.140\n\n  Now, we generate the dates:\n\n      Day1: 2017-01-13\n      Day2: 2017-01-14\n      Day3: 2017-01-15\n      Day4: 2017-01-16\n\n  We'll create 96 rows.\n\n  We must be cautious: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n  We'll start at 2017-01-13 00:00:00 and then increment by 1 hour until 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll write the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n  Code for the answer:\n\n      <answer>\n      \n```\n2017-01-13 00:00:00 12.257\n2017-01-13 01:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-13 02:00:00 10.751\n2017-01-13 03:00:00 11.437\n2017-01-13 04:00:00 10.650\n2017-01-13 05:00:00 10.767\n2017-01-13 06:00:00 12.006\n2017-01-13 07:00:00 12.258\n2017-01-13 08:00:00 11.906\n2017-01-13 09:00:00 10.449\n2017-01-13 10:00:00 9.712\n2017-01-13 11:00:00 10.265\n2017-01-13 12:00:00 6.514\n2017-01-13 13:00:00 6.581\n2017-01-13 14:00:00 7.787\n2017-01-13 15:00:00 7.234\n2017-01-13 16:00:00 8.373\n2017-01-13 17:00:00 10.885\n2017-01-13 18:00:00 10.734\n2017-01-13 19:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-13 20:00:00 10.583\n2017-01-13 21:00:00 9.947\n2017-01-13 22:00:00 10.935\n2017-01-13 23:00:00 12.140\n2017-01-14 00:00:00 12.257\n2017-01-14 01:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-14 02:00:00 10.751\n2017-01-14 03:00:00 11.437\n2017-01-14 04:00:00 10.650\n2017-01-14 05:00:00 10.767\n2017-01-14 06:00:00 12.006\n2017-01-14 07:00:00 12.258\n2017-01-14 08:00:00 11.906\n2017-01-14 09:00:00 10.449\n2017-01-14 10:00:00 9.712\n2017-01-14 11:00:00 10.265\n2017-01-14 12:00:00 6.514\n2017-01-14 13:00:00 6.581\n2017-01-14 14:00:00 7.787\n2017-01-14 15:00:00 7.234\n2017-01-14 16:00:00 8.373\n2017-01-14 17:00:00 10.885\n2017-01-14 18:00:00 10.734\n2017-01-14 19:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-14 20:00:00 10.583\n2017-01-14 21:00:00 9.947\n2017-01-14 22:00:00 10.935\n2017-01-14 23:00:00 12.140\n2017-01-15 00:00:00 12.257\n2017-01-15 01:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-15 02:00:00 10.751\n2017-01-15 03:00:00 11.437\n2017-01-15 04:00:00 10.650\n2017-01-15 05:00:00 10.767\n2017-01-15 06:00:00 12.006\n2017-01-15 07:00:00 12.258\n2017-01-15 08:00:00 11.906\n2017-01-15 09:00:00 10.449\n2017-01-15 10:00:00 9.712\n2017-01-15 11:00:00 10.265\n2017-01-15 12:00:00 6.514\n2017-01-15 13:00:00 6.581\n2017-01-15 14:00:00 7.787\n2017-01-15 15:00:00 7.234\n2017-01-15 16:00:00 8.373\n2017-01-15 17:00:00 10.885\n2017-01-15 18:00:00 10.734\n2017-01-15 19:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-15 20:00:00 10.583\n2017-01-15 21:00:00 9.947\n2017-01-15 22:00:00 10.935\n2017-01-15 23:00:00 12.140\n2017-01-16 00:00:00 12.257\n2017-01-16 01:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-16 02:00:00 10.751\n2017-01-16 03:00:00 11.437\n2017-01-16 04:00:00 10.650\n2017-01-16 05:00:00 10.767\n2017-01-16 06:00:00 12.006\n2017-01-16 07:00:00 12.258\n2017-01-16 08:00:00 11.906\n2017-01-16 09:00:00 10.449\n2017-01-16 10:00:00 9.712\n2017-01-16 11:00:00 10.265\n2017-01-16 12:00:00 6.514\n2017-01-16 13:00:00 6.581\n2017-01-16 14:00:00 7.787\n2017-01-16 15:00:00 7.234\n2017-01-16 16:00:00 8.373\n2017-01-16 17:00:00 10.885\n2017-01-16 18:00:00 10.734\n2017-01-16 19:00:00 11.102\n2017-01-16 20:00:00 10.583\n2017-01-16 21:00:00 9.947\n2017-01-16 22:00:00 10.935\n2017-01-16 23:00:00 12.140\n```\n\n      </answer>\n\n  This is the complete forecast.\n\n  Note: This is a simple method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models, but given the constraints (only 4 days of data) and the requirement to provide 96 points, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n  We are aware of the potential for missing values in the provided data, but there were none, so we used all 4 days.\n\n  We output 96 points without any missing values.\n\n  We follow the format strictly.\n\n  Let me double-check the rounding for hour7: 12.2575 -> rounding to 3 decimals: \n      The fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal: 12.258.\n\n  Similarly, hour16: 8.3725 -> 8.373.\n\n  We are done.\n",
