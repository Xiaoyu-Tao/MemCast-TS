        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any missing values in the training data, but here we have been given a complete block.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must choose a model. Given the relatively small data (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal decomposition: The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not visible.\n    - Models: We can use SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters), or even a simple exponential smoothing if the pattern is clear.\n\n 4. Let's look at the data pattern:\n    - There is a clear daily pattern: temperatures rise during the day and fall at night.\n    - The level of the temperature might be increasing slightly? But 4 days is too short to see a trend.\n\n 5. Given the seasonality of 24 periods (hours) and the short history, we can use a seasonal model. However, with only 4 days (96 points) and forecasting 4 days (96 points),\n    we are forecasting a full seasonal cycle without having multiple cycles in the training.\n\n 6. We can use a simple approach: \n    - Decompose the series to estimate the seasonal and trend components, then project the trend and use the seasonal component.\n    - Alternatively, use a model like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality).\n\n 7. But note: the data has only 4 days, so we have exactly 4-day cycle? Actually, we have one cycle of 24 hours repeated 4 times? Not exactly, because the pattern changes.\n\n 8. We can try to compute the average daily pattern and then adjust by the trend? However, we are also to forecast 4 days, so we can use the daily pattern and assume the same pattern repeats?\n\n 9. But the problem: the data might have a trend? Let's check the first and last day:\n\n    Day1 (2016-08-06): min ~32.85, max ~40.24\n    Day2: min ~33.13, max ~37.21\n    Day3: min ~31.94, max ~38.20\n    Day4: min ~31.51, max ~36.58\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n 10. Approach:\n     We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days to get a daily profile. Then, we use that the next 4 days will follow the same daily profile.\n\n     However, note that the data does not exactly repeat. We can also consider a moving average of the same hour across the days to smooth.\n\n 11. Steps for the average method:\n     - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n     - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat the daily profile 4 times.\n\n 12. But what if there is a trend? We don't have enough data to estimate a trend. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern? \n     However, the problem says to forecast 96 points, and we have to provide the data.\n\n 13. We can also use a naive seasonal model: use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it 4 times? But the last day (2016-08-09) has a different pattern? \n\n 14. Let me try to compute the average per hour:\n\n     We have 4 days, so 4 observations per hour (for hour 0, hour 1, ... hour 23).\n\n     For example, hour 0: \n        2016-08-06 00:00:00 -> 32.852001\n        2016-08-07 00:00:00 -> 33.695999\n        2016-08-08 00:00:00 -> 33.556000\n        2016-08-09 00:00:00 -> 33.132999\n        Average = (32.852001 + 33.695999 + 33.556000 + 33.132999) / 4 = 33.309\n\n     Similarly for other hours.\n\n 15. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00) would be the average for each hour, repeated for 4 days.\n\n 16. However, this method ignores any trend and also the last day's deviation. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a model that uses the last day as the pattern and adjusts by the average level? \n\n 18. Given the constraints, I will use the average method. It is simple and robust for such a short history.\n\n 19. Steps:\n      a) Extract the hour of the day from the datetime.\n      b) Group by hour and compute the mean.\n      c) Create the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 (the next day after 2016-08-09 23:00:00) to 2016-08-13 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n      d) For each of the 4 days, assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 20. But note: the data we are given ends at 2016-08-09 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2016-08-10 00:00:00.\n\n 21. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n     We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n 22. Code for averaging (we do it manually since we have to write the forecast):\n\n     Hour 0: (32.852001 + 33.695999 + 33.556000 + 33.132999) / 4 = 33.309\n     Hour 1: (32.993000 + 34.470001 + 33.695999 + 33.837002) / 4 = 33.74875\n     ... and so on.\n\n 23. However, we have to do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 24. But note: the data we are given is exactly 96 points (4*24). So we can reshape into 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours).\n\n 25. Let me write down the data by hour:\n\n     Day1 (2016-08-06): \n        00: 32.852001, 01:32.993000, 02:32.360001, 03:33.837002, 04:33.907001, 05:33.625999, 06:33.485001, 07:34.188999, 08:37.776001, 09:38.339001, 10:38.620998, 11:39.324001, 12:37.636002, 13:39.535000, 14:40.237999, 15:38.549999, 16:38.902000, 17:38.480000, 18:37.636002, 19:36.862000, 20:35.033001, 21:34.611000, 22:34.188999, 23:33.837002\n\n     Day2 (2016-08-07):\n        00:33.695999, 01:34.470001, 02:34.188999, 03:34.470001, 04:33.132999, 05:33.415001, 06:32.993000, 07:33.132999, 08:34.048000, 09:35.243999, 10:34.048000, 11:34.258999, 12:35.313999, 13:34.821999, 14:35.876999, 15:36.509998, 16:36.862000, 17:37.214001, 18:36.368999, 19:36.721001, 20:34.188999, 21:34.891998, 22:34.188999, 23:34.118000\n\n     Day3 (2016-08-08):\n        00:33.556000, 01:33.695999, 02:33.485001, 03:33.273998, 04:33.132999, 05:32.640999, 06:31.938000, 07:33.415001, 08:33.203999, 09:32.993000, 10:34.048000, 11:34.540001, 12:33.766998, 13:33.978001, 14:35.313999, 15:35.806999, 16:38.198002, 17:36.439999, 18:36.862000, 19:36.509998, 20:35.596001, 21:35.103001, 22:34.891998, 23:34.258999\n\n     Day4 (2016-08-09):\n        00:33.132999, 01:33.837002, 02:33.556000, 03:33.415001, 04:32.710999, 05:32.219002, 06:33.063000, 07:34.540001, 08:33.344002, 09:34.048000, 10:33.485001, 11:33.344002, 12:33.132999, 13:34.188999, 14:35.596001, 15:35.596001, 16:36.580002, 17:35.806999, 18:36.229000, 19:34.891998, 20:31.514999, 21:32.148998, 22:32.077999, 23:32.148998\n\n 26. Now, we compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (32.852001 + 33.695999 + 33.556000 + 33.132999) / 4 = 133.236999 / 4 = 33.30924975\n     Hour 1: (32.993000 + 34.470001 + 33.695999 + 33.837002) / 4 = 134.995002 / 4 = 33.7487505\n     Hour 2: (32.360001 + 34.188999 + 33.485001 + 33.556000) / 4 = 133.590001 / 4 = 33.39750025\n     Hour 3: (33.837002 + 34.470001 + 33.273998 + 33.415001) / 4 = 134.996002 / 4 = 33.7490005\n     Hour 4: (33.907001 + 33.132999 + 33.132999 + 32.710999) / 4 = 132.883998 / 4 = 33.2209995\n     Hour 5: (33.625999 + 33.415001 + 32.640999 + 32.219002) / 4 = 131.900001 / 4 = 32.97500025\n     Hour 6: (33.485001 + 32.993000 + 31.938000 + 33.063000) / 4 = 131.479001 / 4 = 32.86975025\n     Hour 7: (34.188999 + 33.132999 + 33.415001 + 34.540001) / 4 = 135.276000 / 4 = 33.819\n     Hour 8: (37.776001 + 34.048000 + 33.203999 + 33.344002) / 4 = 138.372002 / 4 = 34.5930005\n     Hour 9: (38.339001 + 35.243999 + 32.993000 + 34.048000) / 4 = 140.623999 / 4 = 35.15599975\n     Hour10: (38.620998 + 34.048000 + 34.048000 + 33.485001) / 4 = 140.201999 / 4 = 35.05049975\n     Hour11: (39.324001 + 34.258999 + 34.540001 + 33.344002) / 4 = 141.467003 / 4 = 35.36675075\n     Hour12: (37.636002 + 35.313999 + 33.766998 + 33.132999) / 4 = 139.849998 / 4 = 34.9624995\n     Hour13: (39.535000 + 34.821999 + 33.978001 + 34.188999) / 4 = 142.523999 / 4 = 35.63099975\n     Hour14: (40.237999 + 35.876999 + 35.313999 + 35.596001) / 4 = 147.024998 / 4 = 36.7562495\n     Hour15: (38.549999 + 36.509998 + 35.806999 + 35.596001) / 4 = 146.462997 / 4 = 36.61574925\n     Hour16: (38.902000 + 36.862000 + 38.198002 + 36.580002) / 4 = 150.542004 / 4 = 37.635501\n     Hour17: (38.480000 + 37.214001 + 36.439999 + 35.806999) / 4 = 147.940999 / 4 = 36.98524975\n     Hour18: (37.636002 + 36.368999 + 36.862000 + 36.229000) / 4 = 147.096001 / 4 = 36.77400025\n     Hour19: (36.862000 + 36.721001 + 36.509998 + 34.891998) / 4 = 144.984997 / 4 = 36.24624925\n     Hour20: (35.033001 + 34.188999 + 35.596001 + 31.514999) / 4 = 136.333000 / 4 = 34.08325\n     Hour21: (34.611000 + 34.891998 + 35.103001 + 32.148998) / 4 = 136.754997 / 4 = 34.18874925\n     Hour22: (34.188999 + 34.188999 + 34.891998 + 32.077999) / 4 = 135.347995 / 4 = 33.83699875\n     Hour23: (33.837002 + 34.118000 + 34.258999 + 32.148998) / 4 = 134.362999 / 4 = 33.59074975\n\n 27. Now, we create the next 96 timestamps:\n\n     Start: 2016-08-10 00:00:00\n     Then 2016-08-10 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n 28. The forecast for:\n       2016-08-10 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 33.30924975\n       2016-08-10 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 33.7487505\n       ... and so on.\n\n 29. We'll write the forecast for 4 days (96 hours) using the 24 averages in order, repeated 4 times.\n\n 30. Format the answer as a block of 96 lines with the timestamp and the forecasted OT.\n\n 31. We'll round to 6 decimal places as in the input? The input had 6 decimal places. But note: the input had up to 6, but sometimes less. We'll output 6.\n\n 32. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. We are not given any in the next 96, so we output the forecast.\n\n 33. Write the answer in the required format.\n\n 34. Let's code the output:\n\n     We'll create a list of dates from '2016-08-10 00:00:00' to '2016-08-13 23:00:00' (inclusive) at hourly frequency.\n\n     Then assign:\n        day1: hours 0 to 23 -> use the 24 averages in order\n        day2: same 24 averages\n        day3: same\n        day4: same\n\n 35. The averages we computed above are stored in a list `avg_list` of 24 numbers.\n\n 36. We'll the dates:\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        But we don't need to, we can generate by hand? But 96 is manageable.\n\n     Start: 2016-08-10 00:00:00\n     Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 37. We'll write:\n\n        date = \"2016-08-10\"\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                timestamp = f\"{date} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = avg_list[hour]\n\n        But we have to increment the date.\n\n     Actually, we can do:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016,8,10)\n        then for i in range(96):\n            current = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            hour = current.hour\n            value = avg_list[hour]\n\n 38. But we are not in code, we have to write the data.\n\n 39. Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        Day1: 2016-08-10 00:00:00 -> avg_list[0]\n               2016-08-10 01:00:00 -> avg_list[1]\n               ...\n               2016-08-10 23:00:00 -> avg_list[23]\n\n        Day2: 2016-08-11 00:00:00 -> avg_list[0]\n               2016-08-11 01:00:00 -> avg_list[1]\n               ...\n\n        Day3: 2016-08-12 00:00:00 -> avg_list[0]\n               ...\n\n        Day4: 2016-08-13 00:00:00 -> avg_list[0]\n               ... until 2016-08-13 23:00:00 -> avg_list[23]\n\n 40. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 41. Let me write the averages again (rounded to 6 decimal places) for clarity:\n\n     We computed:\n\n        hour0: 33.30924975 -> 33.309250\n        hour1: 33.7487505  -> 33.748751\n        hour2: 33.39750025 -> 33.397500\n        hour3: 33.7490005  -> 33.749001\n        hour4: 33.2209995  -> 33.221000\n        hour5: 32.97500025 -> 32.975000\n        hour6: 32.86975025 -> 32.869750\n        hour7: 33.819      -> 33.819000\n        hour8: 34.5930005  -> 34.593001\n        hour9: 35.15599975 -> 35.156000\n        hour10:35.05049975 -> 35.050500\n        hour11:35.36675075 -> 35.366751\n        hour12:34.9624995  -> 34.962500\n        hour13:35.63099975 -> 35.631000\n        hour14:36.7562495  -> 36.756250\n        hour15:36.61574925 -> 36.615749\n        hour16:37.635501   -> 37.635501\n        hour17:36.98524975 -> 36.985250\n        hour18:36.77400025 -> 36.774000\n        hour19:36.24624925 -> 36.246249\n        hour20:34.08325    -> 34.083250\n        hour21:34.18874925 -> 34.188749\n        hour22:33.83699875 -> 33.836999\n        hour23:33.59074975 -> 33.590750\n\n 42. But note: we must output exactly as the input, which had 6 decimal places. We'll round to 6.\n\n 43. However, the input had trailing zeros? We can output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 44.
