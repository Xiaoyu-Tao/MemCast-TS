        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load tends to peak during certain hours and drops at night.\n 2. Given the small dataset (only 4 days) and the presence of seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. However, we are also warned of missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? \n    But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" - but in the provided data, we don't see any. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete. However, for forecasting, we must be robust to potential missingness in the future? \n    But the instruction says: \"forecast the data for next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we are to produce 96 points without missing values.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 points (next 4 days). We can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend: from the 4 days, the trend is not very strong? Let's check: \n        The values range between about 1.8 and 6.0. There is no obvious increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n    - Seasonality: 24-hour cycle is evident.\n\n 4. Given the small data, we can use a simple method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (last day) as the forecast. But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? \n    - Or we can use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters).\n\n 5. However, note that the data might have missing values in the future? But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided data might have missing values? \n    But the provided data does not have any. So we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n 6. We are to produce 96 points. We can use a model that uses the last 4 days to predict the next 4 days by averaging the same hour.\n\n    Let's denote:\n        Day1: 2016-10-05 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day2: 2016-10-06 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day3: 2016-10-07 (index 48 to 71)\n        Day4: 2016-10-08 (index 72 to 95)\n\n    For the next 96 hours (4 days: 2016-10-09 to 2016-10-12), we can compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of the same hour in the past 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data might have some anomalies? We can also consider using a weighted average (exponential smoothing) or just the average.\n\n 7. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    For hour 0: (2.947 + 3.014 + 3.952 + 4.957) / 4 = (2.947+3.014+3.952+4.957)=14.87 -> 14.87/4 = 3.7175\n    For hour 1: (3.751+5.894+4.019+4.823)/4 = (3.751+5.894+4.019+4.823)=18.487 -> 4.62175\n\n    But note: the last day (2016-10-08) might be more representative? We could also use a simple average.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a time series model. Since we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code, we have to do a simple method.\n\n 9. We are to output 96 points. We'll generate the next 4 days (from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00) by:\n\n    - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), take the average of the same hour from the 4 available days.\n\n 10. However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all in the same week, Tuesday to Friday? 2016-10-05 is Wednesday). \n     The next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? So the pattern might change for the weekend? But we don't have weekend data in the history.\n\n     The history:\n        2016-10-05: Wednesday\n        2016-10-06: Thursday\n        2016-10-07: Friday\n        2016-10-08: Saturday\n\n     The next 4 days:\n        2016-10-09: Sunday\n        2016-10-10: Monday\n        2016-10-11: Tuesday\n        2016-10-12: Wednesday\n\n     We have one Saturday in the history, but the next days include Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\n     Since we don't have Sunday and Monday in the history, we cannot capture the weekly seasonality. Therefore, we stick to the daily pattern.\n\n 11. We'll use the same daily pattern for all 4 days? But note that the Saturday (2016-10-08) might be different? \n     We can see that on 2016-10-08 (Saturday) the values are generally higher in the night (e.g., at 22:00: 4.220) compared to previous days? \n     However, without more data, we cannot adjust for the day of the week.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we will use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each hour of the next 4 days.\n\n 13. Steps for generating the next 96 hours:\n\n     Let base_date = 2016-10-09 00:00:00 (the next day after 2016-10-08)\n\n     For day_offset in [0,1,2,3] (for 4 days: 2016-10-09, 2016-10-10, 2016-10-11, 2016-10-12)\n        For hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n            hour_index = hour\n            value = (day1[hour] + day2[hour] + day3[hour] + day4[hour]) / 4.0\n\n     But note: the first day in the history is 2016-10-05 (Wednesday) and the next 4 days are Sunday to Wednesday? \n     We are not aligning the day of week. We are just repeating the same daily pattern.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the last 4 days (which include a Saturday) to predict the next 4 days (which include Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). \n     Since we don't have data for Sunday and Monday, we have to use the same pattern.\n\n 15. We can also consider that the Saturday pattern might be different? But we have only one Saturday. So we use the average.\n\n 16. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll extract the 4 days and group by hour.\n\n     Hour 0: [2.947, 3.014, 3.952, 4.957] -> average = (2.947+3.014+3.952+4.957)/4 = 14.87/4 = 3.7175\n     Hour 1: [3.751, 5.894, 4.019, 4.823] -> (3.751+5.894+4.019+4.823)=18.487 -> 4.62175\n     Hour 2: [4.957, 6.028, 5.626, 4.957] -> (4.957+6.028+5.626+4.957)=21.568 -> 5.392\n     Hour 3: [5.827, 6.095, 6.028, 5.157] -> (5.827+6.095+6.028+5.157)=23.107 -> 5.77675\n     Hour 4: [3.751, 5.023, 5.358, 4.823] -> (3.751+5.023+5.358+4.823)=18.955 -> 4.73875\n     Hour 5: [4.488, 4.823, 3.617, 4.823] -> (4.488+4.823+3.617+4.823)=17.751 -> 4.43775\n     Hour 6: [4.488, 4.488, 4.354, 4.488] -> (4.488+4.488+4.354+4.488)=17.818 -> 4.4545\n     Hour 7: [4.957, 5.693, 5.358, 4.622] -> (4.957+5.693+5.358+4.622)=20.63 -> 5.1575\n     Hour 8: [4.689, 4.287, 5.894, 4.823] -> (4.689+4.287+5.894+4.823)=19.693 -> 4.92325\n     Hour 9: [4.354, 3.818, 3.952, 4.220] -> (4.354+3.818+3.952+4.220)=16.344 -> 4.086\n     Hour 10: [4.689, 3.349, 4.354, 4.287] -> (4.689+3.349+4.354+4.287)=16.679 -> 4.16975\n     Hour 11: [4.488, 3.416, 4.019, 3.617] -> (4.488+3.416+4.019+3.617)=15.54 -> 3.885\n     Hour 12: [3.617, 2.210, 2.545, 2.947] -> (3.617+2.210+2.545+2.947)=11.319 -> 2.82975\n     Hour 13: [4.019, 3.684, 3.818, 3.483] -> (4.019+3.684+3.818+3.483)=15.004 -> 3.751\n     Hour 14: [4.086, 4.354, 3.550, 3.751] -> (4.086+4.354+3.550+3.751)=15.741 -> 3.93525\n     Hour 15: [3.684, 3.550, 3.751, 3.818] -> (3.684+3.550+3.751+3.818)=14.803 -> 3.70075\n     Hour 16: [3.416, 3.282, 2.880, 3.215] -> (3.416+3.282+2.880+3.215)=12.793 -> 3.19825\n     Hour 17: [3.148, 2.880, 2.612, 3.282] -> (3.148+2.880+2.612+3.282)=11.922 -> 2.9805\n     Hour 18: [2.478, 2.009, 2.411, 3.215] -> (2.478+2.009+2.411+3.215)=10.113 -> 2.52825\n     Hour 19: [2.612, 1.808, 2.210, 2.746] -> (2.612+1.808+2.210+2.746)=9.376 -> 2.344\n     Hour 20: [2.679, 2.545, 2.478, 2.746] -> (2.679+2.545+2.478+2.746)=10.448 -> 2.612\n     Hour 21: [3.014, 3.215, 2.210, 2.545] -> (3.014+3.215+2.210+2.545)=10.984 -> 2.746\n     Hour 22: [3.617, 3.014, 3.014, 4.220] -> (3.617+3.014+3.014+4.220)=13.865 -> 3.46625\n     Hour 23: [3.684, 2.679, 2.277, 3.416] -> (3.684+2.679+2.277+3.416)=12.056 -> 3.014\n\n 17. Then for the next 4 days (2016-10-09 to 2016-10-12), each day we will use the above 24 averages in order.\n\n 18. Format the dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-10-09 00:00:00\n     Then 2016-10-09 01:00:00 ... until 2016-10-09 23:00:00\n     Then 2016-10-10 00:00:00 ... until 2016-10-10 23:00:00\n     ... until 2016-10-12 23:00:00\n\n 19. We output the data in the same format: two columns: \"date\" and \"HULL\", with the date in the format as given.\n\n 20. We round the HULL values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 21. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast and we are to provide the complete data. \n     So we output 96 rows without missing values.\n\n 22. Let's write the first few rows:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2016-10-09 00:00:00 3.7175 -> 3.718 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        2016-10-09 01:00:00 4.62175 -> 4.622\n        2016-10-09 02:00:00 5.392 -> 5.392\n        2016-10-09 03:00:00 5.77675 -> 5.777\n        ...\n\n 23. We'll do the rounding at the end.\n\n 24. We note that this method is very simple and may not capture potential changes, but with the data and constraints, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 25. We generate the next 96 points by repeating the same 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    base_date = datetime(2016, 10, 9)\n    hours = [0,1,...,23] for 4 days.\n\n    We'll create a list of dates: \n        for day in range(0,4):\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n\n    And the HULL value for a given hour in the day is the average we computed for that hour (indexed by hour).\n\n 26. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n 27. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n Let's code the values for the 24 hours (averages) as a list:\n\n    hourly_avg = [\n        3.7175, 4.62175, 5.392, 5.77675, 4.73875, 4.43775, 4.4545, 5.1575, \n        4.92325, 4.086, 4.16975, 3.885, 2.82975, 3.751, 3.93525, 3.70075, \n        3.19825, 2.9805, 2.52825, 2.344, 2.612, 2.746, 3.46625, 3.014\n    ]\n\n Then for each of the 4 days, we use this list.\n\n 28. Round each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Write the output in the required format.\n\n 30. Note: the last date in the input is 2016-10-08 23:00:00, so the next date is 2016-10-09 00:00:00.\n\n 31. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-09 00:00:00 3.718\n2016-10-09 01:00:00 4.622\n2016-10-09 02:00:00 5.392\n... \n2016-10-12 23:00:00 3.014\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 32. Let's generate the dates and the values.\n\n 33. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 34. We note: the rounding might cause slight differences. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n 35. We do:\n\n        rounded_value = round(raw_value, 3)\n\n 36. But note: the input has 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. We'll compute the hourly averages and round them.\n\n 38. Alternatively, we can use the exact average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 39. Let's recalc and round:\n\n        Hour0: (2.947+3.014+3.952+4.957)/4 = 14.87/4 = 3.7175 -> 3.718\n        Hour1: (3.751+5.894+4.019+4.823)/4 = 18.487/4 = 4.62175 -> 4.622\n        ... \n\n 40. We'll do the same for all.\n\n 41. We'll create the list of 24 rounded averages:\n\n        hourly_avg_rounded = [round(x, 3) for x in hourly_avg]\n\n 42. But we can also compute the average and then round.\n\n 43. We'll do:\n\n        hourly_avg_rounded = [\n            round((2.947+3.014+3.952+4.957)/4, 3), # 3.718\n            round((3.751+5.894+4.019+4.823)/4, 3), # 4.622\n            ... \n        ]\n\n 44. We'll do that for all 24.\n\n 45. Alternatively, we can write a small program, but since we are not in code, we do manually.\n\n 46. We have already computed the averages. We round them:\n\n        [3.7175 -> 3.718, 4.62175->4.622, 5.392->5.392, 5.77675->5.777, \n         4.73875->4.739, 4.43775->4.438, 4.4545->4.455, 5.1575->5.158,\n         4.92325->4.923, 4.086->4.086, 4.16975->4.170, 3.885->3.885,\n         2.82975->2.830, 3.751->3.751, 3.93525->3.935, 3.70075->3.701,\n         3.19825->3.198, 2.9805->2.981, 2.52825->2.528, 2.344->2.344,\n         2.612->2.612, 2.746->2.746, 3.46625->3.466, 3.014->3.014]\n\n 47. Now we write the 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-09: [3.718, 4.622, 5.392, 5.777, 3.014] ... until 24 values\n        Day2: 2016-10-10: same 24 values\n        Day3: 2016-10-11: same 24 values\n        Day4: 2016-10-12: same 24 values\n\n 48. We output the data.\n\n 49. We note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\".\n\n 50. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 51. We generate the dates:\n\n        from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00\n\n 52. We write:\n\n        2016-10-09 00:00:00 3.718\n        2016-10-09 01:00:00 4.622\n        ... \n        2016-10-09 23:00:00 3.014\n        2016-10-10 00:00:00 3.718\n        ... \n        2016-10-12 23:00:00 3.014\n\n 53. We have 4*24=96 lines.\n\n 54.
