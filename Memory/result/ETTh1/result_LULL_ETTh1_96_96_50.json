        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing entries. We have 24*4 = 96 points (4 days of hourly data).\n\n 2. We must choose a forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality (since there are 24 hours in a day).\n\n 3. Since the data is relatively short (only 4 days) and we are forecasting 4 days ahead, we can consider models like:\n    - Seasonal Naive (using the same value from the same hour of the previous day)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality)\n    - ARIMA/SARIMA\n\n 4. However, note that the data does not have a clear trend but does show daily patterns. For example, we see peaks during the day and lower values at night.\n\n 5. Given the small data size, we might use a seasonal naive model as a baseline. But note: the data from one day to the next is not exactly the same, but the pattern is similar.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we can use a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 7. We can use the last day (2017-01-20) as a base and adjust with the average pattern? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 8. Considering the requirement and the fact that we are to provide 96 points, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Compute the average hourly pattern over the 4 days and then use that pattern for the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend.\n\n 9. However, looking at the data, there is no obvious trend. The values are fluctuating without a clear upward or downward trend.\n\n 10. We can also use the last day (2017-01-20) and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But that might be complex.\n\n 11. Given the constraints, I propose to use a Seasonal Naive model that uses the value from the same hour of the previous day. Since we are forecasting 4 days ahead, we can use the last day (2017-01-20) for the first day of the forecast (2017-01-21), then for 2017-01-22 we use the forecast for 2017-01-21 (which is the same as 2017-01-20) but that would be the same as 2017-01-20 again? That would be a flat forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour across the 4 available days. This would smooth out the daily pattern.\n\n 13. Let's calculate the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.731 + 0.640 + 0.640 + 0.670) / 4 = (0.731+0.640+0.640+0.670)/4 = 2.681/4 = 0.67025\n     Hour 1: (0.731 + 0.579 + 0.609 + 0.670) / 4 = (0.731+0.579+0.609+0.670) = 2.589/4 = 0.64725\n     ... and so on.\n\n 14. Then we can use this average pattern for each of the next 4 days? But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to capture weekly (only 4 days, all in the same week?).\n\n 15. However, the problem does not specify any weekly pattern and we only have 4 days. So we can assume the pattern is daily.\n\n 16. Steps for the average method:\n      - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat this average for each hour, for 4 times.\n\n 17. But note: the data starts at 2017-01-17 (Tuesday) and ends at 2017-01-20 (Friday). The next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? There might be a weekend effect? But we don't have weekend data to compare. So we ignore.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. However, with only 96 points and the need to forecast 96 points, and without more context, the average by hour might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 19. Let's check the data for the same hour (for example hour 0) over the 4 days:\n        Day1: 0.731\n        Day2: 0.640\n        Day3: 0.640\n        Day4: 0.670\n      There is no clear trend, so averaging is acceptable.\n\n 20. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 21. How to handle missing values? The problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete. For the forecast, we don't have to handle missing.\n\n 22. Implementation:\n\n     Step 1: Extract the hour of the day from the datetime index.\n     Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n     Step 3: Create the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-01-21 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n     Step 4: For each of these new timestamps, assign the average value corresponding to the hour.\n\n 23. However, note that the data might have some noise. But without a more complex model, this is a straightforward approach.\n\n 24. Let's consider: the average might smooth out the pattern. But the actual data shows some variation day to day. But for forecasting 4 days without more data, it is acceptable.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-20) as the forecast for the next day? But then what about the day after? We don't have data beyond. So we can use the same last day for all 4 days? That would be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-21): same as 2017-01-20\n        Day2 (2017-01-22): same as 2017-01-20\n        Day4 (2017-01-24): same as 2017-01-20\n\n     This is the seasonal naive with seasonality=24, but using only the last day.\n\n 26. Which one is better? The average over 4 days might be more robust. But the last day might capture the most pattern? However, the last day (2017-01-20) is a Friday and the next days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. We don't know if the pattern changes on weekends? But we don't have weekend data.\n\n 27. Since we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality, we stick to daily.\n\n 28. We'll go with the average by hour.\n\n 29. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.731, 0.640, 0.640, 0.670) -> mean = (0.731+0.640+0.640+0.670)/4 = 2.681/4 = 0.67025\n     Hour 1: (0.731, 0.579, 0.609, 0.670) -> (0.731+0.579+0.609+0.670)=2.589/4=0.64725\n     Hour 2: (0.731, 0.640, 0.609, 0.670) -> (0.731+0.640+0.609+0.670)=2.65/4=0.6625\n     Hour 3: (0.761, 0.640, 0.609, 0.670) -> (0.761+0.640+0.609+0.670)=2.68/4=0.67\n     Hour 4: (0.761, 0.640, 0.640, 0.701) -> (0.761+0.640+0.640+0.701)=2.742/4=0.6855\n     Hour 5: (0.822, 0.640, 0.670, 0.548) -> (0.822+0.640+0.670+0.548)=2.68/4=0.67\n     Hour 6: (0.731, 0.701, 0.670, 0.548) -> (0.731+0.701+0.670+0.548)=2.65/4=0.6625\n     Hour 7: (0.670, 0.640, 0.640, 0.609) -> (0.670+0.640+0.640+0.609)=2.559/4=0.63975\n     Hour 8: (0.944, 0.609, 0.761, 0.640) -> (0.944+0.609+0.761+0.640)=2.954/4=0.7385\n     Hour 9: (1.127, 0.853, 0.944, 0.761) -> (1.127+0.853+0.944+0.761)=3.685/4=0.92125\n     Hour 10: (0.822, 0.975, 1.097, 0.853) -> (0.822+0.975+1.097+0.853)=3.747/4=0.93675\n     Hour 11: (1.097, 1.066, 0.792, 0.822) -> (1.097+1.066+0.792+0.822)=3.777/4=0.94425\n     Hour 12: (0.701, 0.792, 0.914, 0.792) -> (0.701+0.792+0.914+0.792)=3.199/4=0.79975\n     Hour 13: (1.036, 1.005, 0.731, 0.853) -> (1.036+1.005+0.731+0.853)=3.625/4=0.90625\n     Hour 14: (1.188, 0.853, 1.218, 0.975) -> (1.188+0.853+1.218+0.975)=4.234/4=1.0585\n     Hour 15: (0.975, 0.822, 1.005, 0.670) -> (0.975+0.822+1.005+0.670)=3.472/4=0.868\n     Hour 16: (0.853, 0.640, 1.097, 1.036) -> (0.853+0.640+1.097+1.036)=3.626/4=0.9065\n     Hour 17: (0.853, 0.701, 0.670, 0.944) -> (0.853+0.701+0.670+0.944)=3.168/4=0.792\n     Hour 18: (0.822, 0.731, 1.005, 0.761) -> (0.822+0.731+1.005+0.761)=3.319/4=0.82975\n     Hour 19: (0.640, 0.670, 0.761, 0.822) -> (0.640+0.670+0.761+0.822)=2.893/4=0.72325\n     Hour 20: (0.640, 0.731, 0.883, 0.792) -> (0.640+0.731+0.883+0.792)=3.046/4=0.7615\n     Hour 21: (0.731, 0.670, 0.701, 0.792) -> (0.731+0.670+0.701+0.792)=2.894/4=0.7235\n     Hour 22: (0.640, 0.609, 0.579, 0.731) -> (0.640+0.609+0.579+0.731)=2.559/4=0.63975\n     Hour 23: (0.670, 0.640, 0.640, 0.822) -> (0.670+0.640+0.640+0.822)=2.772/4=0.693\n\n 30. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-01-21 (Saturday) -> hours 0 to 23: use the above averages in order.\n      Day 2: 2017-01-22 (Sunday) -> same as above\n      Day 3: 2017-01-23 (Monday) -> same\n      Day 4: 2017-01-24 (Tuesday) -> same\n\n 31. So the forecast for 2017-01-21 00:00:00 is 0.67025, 2017-01-21 01:00:00 is 0.64725, ... and so on.\n\n 32. We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 33. But note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n     Let's recalculate and round:\n\n        Hour0: 0.67025 -> 0.670\n        Hour1: 0.64725 -> 0.647\n        Hour2: 0.6625 -> 0.663\n        Hour3: 0.67 -> 0.670\n        Hour4: 0.6855 -> 0.686\n        Hour5: 0.67 -> 0.670\n        Hour6: 0.6625 -> 0.663\n        Hour7: 0.63975 -> 0.640\n        Hour8: 0.7385 -> 0.738\n        Hour9: 0.92125 -> 0.921\n        Hour10: 0.93675 -> 0.937\n        Hour11: 0.94425 -> 0.944\n        Hour12: 0.79975 -> 0.800\n        Hour13: 0.90625 -> 0.906\n        Hour14: 1.0585 -> 1.059\n        Hour15: 0.868 -> 0.868\n        Hour16: 0.9065 -> 0.907\n        Hour17: 0.792 -> 0.792\n        Hour18: 0.82975 -> 0.830\n        Hour19: 0.72325 -> 0.723\n        Hour20: 0.7615 -> 0.762\n        Hour21: 0.7235 -> 0.724\n        Hour22: 0.63975 -> 0.640\n        Hour23: 0.693 -> 0.693\n\n 34. Now, we write the next 96 timestamps with these values repeated 4 times.\n\n 35. Format: \n        <answer>\n        date, LULL\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00, 0.670\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00, 0.647\n        ... \n        2017-01-21 23:00:00, 0.693\n        2017-01-22 00:00:00, 0.670\n        ... \n        2017-01-24 23:00:00, 0.693\n\n 36. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 37. Let's generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-21 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-01-24 23:00:00\n\n 38. We'll create a list of 96 timestamps by starting at 2017-01-21 00:00:00 and adding 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 39. Code for generating the timestamps (in Python):\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        start = '2017-01-21 00:00:00'\n        dates = pd.date_range(start=start, periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 40. But we are to output without using code? We can do it manually? 96 is a lot. We can write a loop in our mind.\n\n 41. We'll write the first day (24 hours) with the 24 average values, then the second day same 24 values, and so on.\n\n 42. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 43. Note: the input data had the date format as \"2017-01-17 00:00:00\", so we follow the same.\n\n 44. Let's write the answer accordingly.\n\n 45. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps? So we output 96 consecutive points.\n\n 46. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00,0.647\n        2017-01-21 02:00:00,0.663\n        2017-01-21 03:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-21 04:00:00,0.686\n        2017-01-21 05:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-21 06:00:00,0.663\n        2017-01-21 07:00:00,0.640\n        2017-01-21 08:00:00,0.738\n        2017-01-21 09:00:00,0.921\n        2017-01-21 10:00:00,0.937\n        2017-01-21 11:00:00,0.944\n        2017-01-21 12:00:00,0.800\n        2017-01-21 13:00:00,0.906\n        2017-01-21 14:00:00,1.059\n        2017-01-21 15:00:00,0.868\n        2017-01-21 16:00:00,0.907\n        2017-01-21 17:00:00,0.792\n        2017-01-21 18:00:00,0.830\n        2017-01-21 19:00:00,0.723\n        2017-01-21 20:00:00,0.762\n        2017-01-21 21:00:00,0.724\n        2017-01-21 22:00:00,0.640\n        2017-01-21 23:00:00,0.693\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next day (2017-01-22) and so on.\n\n 47. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 48. We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 49. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we write all 96.\n\n 50. However, due to the length, we write a program to generate the text? But we are to output in the response.\n\n 51. We'll write the first day and then note that the next three days are the same pattern.\n\n 52. But to be complete, we write all 96.\n\n 53. Alternatively, we can write a loop in the text? But the format requires the data.\n\n 54. We decide to write the 96 lines.\n\n 55. But note: the rounding: we rounded to 3 decimals. The original data had 3 decimals.\n\n 56. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00,0.647\n        ... \n\n 57. We do not include the word \"date\" and \"LULL\" as headers? The example input had:\n\n               date  LULL\n        2017-01-17 00:00:00 0.731\n\n    But the input was in a two-column format. However, the output format in the answer should be:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00,0.670\n        ...\n\n    So without headers.\n\n 58. We generate the data.\n\n 59. We'll write the 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-21: [0.670, 0.647, 0.663, 0.670, 0.686, 0.670, 0.663, 0.640, 0.738, 0.921, 0.937, 0.944, 0.800, 0.906, 1.059, 0.868, 0.907, 0.792, 0.830, 0.723, 0.762, 0.724, 0.640, 0.693]\n        Day2: 2017-01-22: same list\n        Day3: 2017-01-23: same list\n        Day4: 2017-01-24: same list\n\n 60. Now, we write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 61. We do it step by step.\n\n 62. We note: the first timestamp is 2017-01-21 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00, then 2017-01-22 00:00:00, etc.\n\n 63. We write:\n\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00,0.647\n        2017-01-21 02:00:00,0.663\n        2017-01-21 03:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-21 04:00:00,0.686\n        2017-01-21 05:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-21 06:00:00,0.663\n        2017-01-21 07:00:00,0.640\n        2017-01-21 08:00:00,0.738\n        2017-01-21 09:00:00,0.921\n        2017-01-21 10:00:00,0.937\n        2017-01-21 11:00:00,0.944\n        2017-01-21 12:00:00,0.800\n        2017-01-21 13:00:00,0.906\n        2017-01-21 14:00:00,1.059\n        2017-01-21 15:00:00,0.868\n        2017-01-21 16:00:00,0.907\n        2017-01-21 17:00:00,0.792\n        2017-01-21 18:00:00,0.830\n        2017-01-21 19:00:00,0.723\n        2017-01-21 20:00:00,0.762\n        2017-01-21 21:00:00,0.724\n        2017-01-21 22:00:00,0.640\n        2017-01-21 23:00:00,0.693\n\n        Then for 2017-01-22:\n\n        2017-01-22 00:00:00,0.670\n        2017-01-22 01:00:00,0.647\n        ... (same as above for 24 hours)\n\n        And similarly for 2017-01-23 and 2017-01-24.\n\n 64. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 65. Due to the length, we rely on the pattern.\n\n 66. We output the answer in the required format.\n\n 67. Note: We are rounding the averages to 3 decimal places. The original data had 3 decimal places.\n\n 68. We are done.\n",
