        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided 96 points do not have missing values, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, the given past data is complete. For forecasting, we assume the past data is complete and we are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 2. We must use a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the presence of daily seasonality (as seen in the pattern over days), we can consider methods like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality), or even a simple seasonal naive method.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data has a clear daily pattern (24 hours), we can set the seasonality to 24.\n\n 4. However, note that the data also shows some non-stationarity and possible trend. We might need to difference the data.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast, we can use an automated method to select the best model. But note: we are in a constrained environment without the ability to run code. Therefore, we must rely on a method that we can describe and compute manually? \n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple and robust method: Seasonal Naive. In this method, the forecast for each hour is the value of the same hour from the last available day. However, we have 4 days of data: 25,26,27,28 of August. We can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? Or use the last day (28th) as the forecast for the next day? But note, the pattern might change.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days. This would account for daily seasonality and smooth out some noise.\n\n 8. However, the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So for the forecast, we are to generate 96 points without missing values? The problem says \"complete data\".\n\n 9. We are to provide the next 96 dates and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n 10. Let's generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-08-29 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-09-01 23:00:00.\n\n 11. We choose: Since we don't have a model fitting environment, we use a simple average by hour of the last 4 days.\n\n    For example, the forecast for 2017-08-29 00:00:00 would be the average of:\n        2017-08-25 00:00:00: 20.898001\n        2017-08-26 00:00:00: 11.788000\n        2017-08-27 00:00:00: 13.195000\n        2017-08-28 00:00:00: 15.740000\n\n    Then for 2017-08-29 01:00:00, average of the 01:00:00 values of the past 4 days, and so on.\n\n 12. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality. It is robust to some level of noise.\n\n 13. However, note that the data on 2017-08-25 (the first day) has a very high value at 00:00:00 (20.898) compared to the others. This might be an outlier? But we are taking the average so it will be smoothed.\n\n 14. Let's compute the first few:\n\n    Hour 00:00: (20.898001 + 11.788000 + 13.195000 + 15.740000) / 4 = (61.621001) / 4 = 15.40525025 -> approx 15.405\n    Hour 01:00: (17.482000 + 11.655000 + 11.855000 + 15.271000) / 4 = (56.263) / 4 = 14.06575 -> approx 14.066\n\n 15. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not given any in the past 96, so we assume the past is complete. For the forecast, we are generating without missing values.\n\n 16. We'll generate the next 96 points by:\n\n        For hour h in [0,23]:\n            Let values = [ value at hour h of day1, day2, day3, day4 ]\n            forecast for day5, hour h = average(values)\n\n        Then for day6, we would use the same set? But note: we are only given 4 days. We can only use the same 4 days for the entire forecast? \n\n        However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). So we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same 4-day average for each of the next 4 days? That would mean the forecast for each day is the same 24-hour pattern.\n\n        But that would be a constant daily pattern. Alternatively, we can use a moving window? But we don't have more data.\n\n 17. We decide: for each hour of the day, we compute the average of that hour over the 4 available days. Then we use that same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        So the forecast for:\n          2017-08-29 00:00:00: avg of 00:00 of 25,26,27,28\n          2017-08-29 01:00:00: avg of 01:00 of 25,26,27,28\n          ... until 23:00:00 of 2017-08-29\n\n        Then for 2017-08-30, we use the same pattern? Because we don't have a new day to update the average.\n\n        But note: the problem says to forecast 96 hours (4 days). We can use the same daily pattern for all 4 days? That would be repetitive.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-28) as the base and then adjust by the average daily variation? But that might be complex.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a model, we will use the same daily pattern for the next 4 days. This is a common approach in simple seasonal models when the seasonality is stable.\n\n 20. Therefore, we compute 24 averages (for each hour of the day) and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 21. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: (20.898001 + 11.788000 + 13.195000 + 15.740000) / 4 = 15.40525025\n        hour1: (17.482000 + 11.655000 + 11.855000 + 15.271000) / 4 = 14.06575\n        hour2: (15.807000 + 10.382000 + 11.922000 + 14.535000) / 4 = 13.1615\n        hour3: (16.745001 + 11.119000 + 12.056000 + 13.798000) / 4 = 13.42950025\n        hour4: (16.611000 + 10.784000 + 10.181000 + 12.927000) / 4 = 12.62575\n        hour5: (15.405000 + 10.784000 + 12.257000 + 13.128000) / 4 = 12.8935\n        hour6: (14.401000 + 10.181000 + 11.855000 + 12.190000) / 4 = 12.15675\n        hour7: (11.521000 + 9.645000 + 8.573000 + 9.109000) / 4 = 9.712\n        hour8: (4.354000 + 7.569000 + 2.545000 + 3.818000) / 4 = 4.5715\n        hour9: (-1.139000 + 4.019000 + (-2.880000) + (-1.741000)) / 4 = -0.43525\n        hour10: (-3.550000 + 1.875000 + (-7.301000) + (-5.626000)) / 4 = -3.6505\n        hour11: (-7.167000 + 4.555000 + (-10.449000) + (-8.306000)) / 4 = -5.34175\n        hour12: (-8.908000 + 2.746000 + (-11.454000) + (-8.908000)) / 4 = -6.631\n        hour13: (3.483000 + 2.009000 + (-10.717000) + (-8.306000)) / 4 = -3.38275\n        hour14: (-7.502000 + 1.541000 + (-8.640000) + (-3.215000)) / 4 = -4.454\n        hour15: (-4.287000 + 1.942000 + (-5.358000) + (-3.215000)) / 4 = -2.7295\n        hour16: (9.913000 + 0.804000 + (-1.072000) + 0.000000) / 4 = 2.41125\n        hour17: (9.712000 + 3.818000 + 4.488000 + 5.358000) / 4 = 5.844\n        hour18: (8.707000 + 5.961000 + 8.038000 + 9.310000) / 4 = 8.004\n        hour19: (9.310000 + 8.105000 + 10.851000 + 13.329000) / 4 = 10.39875\n        hour20: (9.444000 + 8.908000 + 15.004000 + 17.214001) / 4 = 12.64250025\n        hour21: (8.573000 + 9.712000 + 14.468000 + 15.941000) / 4 = 12.1735\n        hour22: (9.176000 + 9.511000 + 15.539000 + 15.807000) / 4 = 12.50825\n        hour23: (11.588000 + 11.588000 + 16.677999 + 16.209000) / 4 = 14.01599975\n\n 22. We round to 3 decimal places as in the original data.\n\n        hour0: 15.405\n        hour1: 14.066\n        hour2: 13.162\n        hour3: 13.430\n        hour4: 12.626\n        hour5: 12.894\n        hour6: 12.157\n        hour7: 9.712\n        hour8: 4.572\n        hour9: -0.435\n        hour10: -3.651\n        hour11: -5.342\n        hour12: -6.631\n        hour13: -3.383\n        hour14: -4.454\n        hour15: -2.730\n        hour16: 2.411\n        hour17: 5.844\n        hour18: 8.004\n        hour19: 10.399\n        hour20: 12.643\n        hour21: 12.174\n        hour22: 12.508\n        hour23: 14.016\n\n 23. Now, we create the next 4 days (2017-08-29 to 2017-09-01) by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 24. The dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-08-29 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-08-30 00:00:00 to 2017-08-30 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-08-31 00:00:00 to 2017-08-31 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-09-01 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00\n\n 25. The HUFL values for each day will be the same: the 24 numbers above.\n\n 26. Therefore, we write 96 lines of data.\n\n 27. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-29 00:00:00  15.405\n2017-08-29 01:00:00  14.066\n... (all 24 hours for 2017-08-29)\n2017-08-29 23:00:00  14.016\n2017-08-30 00:00:00  15.405\n2017-08-30 01:00:00  14.066\n... (same pattern for 2017-08-30)\n2017-08-30 23:00:00  14.016\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 28. But note: the last day of the given data is 2017-08-28. The next day is 2017-08-29? Yes.\n\n 29. We must be cautious: the data provided ends at 2017-08-28 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2017-08-29 00:00:00.\n\n 30. We output the data in the same format: two columns, the date and then the HUFL value.\n\n 31. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 32. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. Let's write the first 24 hours (first day) and then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 34. We note: the average we computed for hour0 was 15.40525025 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 15.405. Similarly for others.\n\n 35. We output the entire 96 records.\n\n 36. Since the pattern is the same for each day, we can generate:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-08-29 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n        values = [15.405, 14.066, 13.162, 13.430, 12.626, 12.894, 12.157, 9.712, 4.572, -0.435, -3.651, -5.342, -6.631, -3.383, -4.454, -2.730, 2.411, 5.844, 8.004, 10.399, 12.643, 12.174, 12.508, 14.016] * 4\n\n 37. But note: the list of 24 values repeated 4 times.\n\n 38. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 39. However, let me double-check the hour0 for the next day: 2017-08-30 00:00:00 should be the same as 2017-08-29 00:00:00? Yes, because we are using a fixed daily pattern.\n\n 40. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 41. We output the data.\n",
