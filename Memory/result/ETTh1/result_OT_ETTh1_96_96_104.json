        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours = 96).\n\n 2. The problem mentions that the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values.\n\n 3. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 4. Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can choose an appropriate model. Given the hourly data and the relatively short history (only 4 days), we might consider:\n    - The data shows a daily pattern (diurnal cycle) as temperatures rise during the day and fall at night.\n    - We can use a model that captures seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 (hours in a day).\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 96 points, we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach by decomposing the series and then forecasting the components. But note: we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history.\n\n 7. Given the limited data, we might use a naive seasonal approach: using the last day (or the average of the available days) as the forecast for the next days? But note the data shows a trend? Let's check:\n\n    - The first day (2017-08-21) starts at 14.421 and ends at 15.547.\n    - The second day starts at 15.054 and ends at 16.25.\n    - The third day starts at 16.109 and ends at 18.009.\n    - The fourth day starts at 17.868 and ends at 18.009.\n\n    There seems to be an increasing trend? But also note the fourth day starts higher than the previous days.\n\n 8. However, we are to forecast the next 4 days. Without more context (like more historical data) we must rely on the given 96 points.\n\n 9. We can use a model that uses the daily pattern and the trend. Let's try to model with a linear trend and daily seasonality.\n\n    We can use:\n        y(t) = trend(t) + seasonal(t) + noise\n\n    For trend, we can fit a linear regression with time index. For seasonality, we can use dummy variables for each hour.\n\n    Steps for linear model:\n        - Create a time index: t = 1 to 96.\n        - Create 24 variables for the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n\n    But note: we have 96 points and 24 dummies plus a trend term (and intercept) would be 25+ parameters? That might be acceptable.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use Fourier terms for seasonality to reduce the number of parameters.\n\n 10. However, the problem requires forecasting 96 points. We must be cautious because the linear trend might not hold for 4 more days? \n\n 11. Another idea: use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the forecast, we can use a simple method:\n\n     - Calculate the average for each hour of the day (across the 4 days) and then use that as the forecast for each day? But that ignores trend.\n\n     - Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour and then add the average change from day to day? \n\n 13. Let's try to capture the trend:\n\n     We can compute the daily average temperature:\n\n        Day1: average of 24 hours on 2017-08-21\n        Day2: average of 24 hours on 2017-08-22\n        Day3: average of 24 hours on 2017-08-23\n        Day4: average of 24 hours on 2017-08-24\n\n     Then, the daily average:\n\n        Day1: 16.00 (approx) \n        Day2: 16.92\n        Day3: 18.30\n        Day4: 18.80\n\n     The trend: we can fit a linear regression on these daily averages:\n\n        t (day index): [1,2,3,4] -> averages: [16.00, 16.92, 18.30, 18.80]\n\n        Let's compute the slope: \n            slope = (18.80 - 16.00) / (4-1) = 2.8/3 = 0.933 per day.\n\n     Then for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) the daily average would be:\n\n        day5: 18.80 + 0.933 = 19.733\n        day6: 19.733 + 0.933 = 20.666\n        day7: 20.666 + 0.933 = 21.599\n        day8: 21.599 + 0.933 = 22.532\n\n     But note: the trend might be linear? And we are extrapolating 4 days. Also, the increase from day3 to day4 was only 0.5, so the trend might be flattening.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the last two days to compute the trend? Or use exponential smoothing? \n\n 15. Given the ambiguity, we can use a more robust method: STL decomposition (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) and then forecast the trend and seasonally adjusted series. But with only 4 days, the STL might not be stable.\n\n 16. We are constrained by the data. We can use a simple additive model:\n\n        Forecast for hour h of day d = (daily average for day d) + (hourly deviation from daily average)\n\n     Where the hourly deviation is the average of the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the daily average for each of the 4 days.\n\n        Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the deviation from the daily average for that day, then average these deviations for the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Step 3: For the next 4 days (day5 to day8), we need the daily average. We can use the linear trend we computed above? Or we can use the last daily average (day4) and assume the trend continues? \n\n        However, note that the daily average for day4 (2017-08-24) is 18.80. We can use the daily average for the next days as:\n\n            day5: 18.80 + 0.933 = 19.733\n            day6: 19.733 + 0.933 = 20.666\n            day7: 20.666 + 0.933 = 21.599\n            day8: 21.599 + 0.933 = 22.532\n\n        But wait, the trend we computed was 0.933 per day? That might be too steep. The increase from day3 to day4 was only 0.5. So we might use a moving average of the last two days' trend? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average daily increase over the 4 days: \n\n            total increase = 18.80 - 16.00 = 2.8 over 3 days -> 0.933 per day.\n\n        We'll use that.\n\n        Step 4: For each hour h in [0,23] for the next 4 days:\n\n            forecast = daily_avg(day) + avg_hourly_deviation(h)\n\n        Step 5: But note: the hourly deviation might change? We are assuming it's fixed.\n\n 17. Let's compute the hourly deviations:\n\n        We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n        Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n\n            Day1: 14.421, daily_avg1 = 16.00 -> deviation = 14.421 - 16.00 = -1.579\n            Day2: 15.054, daily_avg2 = 16.92 -> deviation = 15.054 - 16.92 = -1.866\n            Day3: 16.109, daily_avg3 = 18.30 -> deviation = 16.109 - 18.30 = -2.191\n            Day4: 17.868, daily_avg4 = 18.80 -> deviation = 17.868 - 18.80 = -0.932\n\n        Average deviation for hour0 = (-1.579 -1.866 -2.191 -0.932)/4 = (-6.568)/4 = -1.642\n\n        Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 18. Then for day5 (2017-08-25) at hour0:\n\n        daily_avg5 = 18.80 + 0.933 = 19.733\n        forecast = 19.733 + (-1.642) = 18.091\n\n 19. However, note that the daily average for day4 was 18.80, and we are adding 0.933 per day. But the deviations we computed are relative to the daily average of that day.\n\n 20. We must compute the daily averages for the 4 days more accurately.\n\n     Let me compute the exact daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2017-08-21): \n            sum = 14.421+14.843+14.069+13.788+14.632+14.351+14.773+16.18+17.165+17.235+16.954+16.883+17.235+16.954+18.642+19.275+19.416+18.712+17.376+16.602+16.391+16.25+15.969+15.547\n            = 383.99 (approx) -> average = 383.99/24 = 16.00 (exactly: 383.99/24 = 15.999583)\n\n        Day2 (2017-08-22):\n            sum = 15.054+14.773+14.632+14.351+14.28+13.999+13.999+14.562+14.984+15.758+15.898+16.532+16.672+17.938+18.501+19.416+19.064+17.798+17.094+16.813+16.602+16.391+16.25+16.109\n            = 406.08 -> average = 406.08/24 = 16.92\n\n        Day3 (2017-08-23):\n            sum = 16.109+16.321+16.039+16.18+15.687+15.547+15.476+16.602+17.305+17.235+18.009+18.431+18.642+20.893+21.034+22.23+21.667+20.119+18.361+17.868+18.009+18.079+18.009+17.868\n            = 439.25 -> average = 439.25/24 = 18.302083\n\n        Day4 (2017-08-24):\n            sum = 17.868+18.22+17.938+18.15+17.727+18.009+17.657+19.064+19.205+18.22+18.361+18.009+18.501+19.697+20.119+20.119+21.034+19.768+19.064+18.923+18.853+18.501+18.009+18.009\n            = 451.22 -> average = 451.22/24 = 18.800833\n\n        So the daily averages: [15.999583, 16.92, 18.302083, 18.800833]\n\n        The daily increase: \n            from day1 to day2: 16.92 - 15.999583 = 0.920417\n            from day2 to day3: 18.302083 - 16.92 = 1.382083\n            from day3 to day4: 18.800833 - 18.302083 = 0.49875\n\n        The average daily increase: (0.920417+1.382083+0.49875)/3 = 2.80125/3 = 0.93375\n\n        So we'll use 0.93375 per day.\n\n        Then:\n            day5: 18.800833 + 0.93375 = 19.734583\n            day6: 19.734583 + 0.93375 = 20.668333\n            day7: 20.668333 + 0.93375 = 21.602083\n            day8: 21.602083 + 0.93375 = 22.535833\n\n 21. Now compute the average hourly deviations:\n\n        For each hour_index (0 to 23), we have 4 values: \n            deviation_i = value_i - daily_avg(day_i)\n\n        Then average these 4 deviations.\n\n        Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n\n            day1: 14.421 - 15.999583 = -1.578583\n            day2: 15.054 - 16.92 = -1.866\n            day3: 16.109 - 18.302083 = -2.193083\n            day4: 17.868 - 18.800833 = -0.932833\n\n            average = (-1.578583 -1.866 -2.193083 -0.932833)/4 = (-6.5705)/4 = -1.642625\n\n        Similarly, we compute for all hours.\n\n 22. Then the forecast for:\n\n        day5, hour0: 19.734583 + (-1.642625) = 18.091958\n        day5, hour1: 19.734583 + (avg_deviation for hour1) = ...\n\n 23. We must compute the average deviation for all 24 hours.\n\n 24. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n 25. We'll compute the deviations for each hour and then the average.\n\n 26. But note: we are forecasting 96 points, so we need to generate 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 27. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-08-24 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-08-25 01:00:00, ... until 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We must be cautious: the trend might be too aggressive? But we are following the method.\n\n 29. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model? But the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide the forecast.\n\n 30. Given the time, we will proceed with this method.\n\n 31. Let's compute the average deviations for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour index (0 to 23) and collect the deviations.\n\n    Then we compute the average.\n\n 32. We'll do:\n\n        hour0: [14.421, 15.054, 16.109, 17.868] -> deviations = [14.421-15.999583, 15.054-16.92, 16.109-18.302083, 17.868-18.800833] \n            = [-1.578583, -1.866, -2.193083,

Now we have the average deviations for each hour.\n\n 34. Then for each day in the forecast (day5 to day8) and for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n        forecast = (daily_avg for that day) + (average deviation for that hour)\n\n        daily_avg for day5: 19.734583\n        day6: 20.668333\n        day7: 21.602083\n        day8: 22.535833\n\n 35. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        day5: 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-25 23:00:00\n        day6: 2017-08-26 00:00:00 to 2017-08-26 23:00:00\n        day7: 2017-08-27 00:00:00 to 2017-08-27 23:00:00\n        day8: 2017-08-28 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00\n\n 36. We'll compute the forecast for each hour.\n\n 37. Example for 2017-08-25 00:00:00:\n\n        hour0: 19.734583 + (-1.642625) = 18.091958\n\n        for 2017-08-25 01:00:00:\n\n        hour1: 19.734583 + (-1.466375) = 18.268208\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 38. We'll write the full 96 points.\n\n 39. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we'll provide 96 numbers.\n\n 40. We'll round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. However, the original data had up to 3 decimal places, but we are using more precise intermediate values. We'll round the final forecast to 3 decimal places.\n\n 42. Let's generate the data.\n\n 43. We'll create a list:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-08-25 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n        forecasts = []\n\n        for day_index in [0,1,2,3]:   # representing day5, day6, day7, day8\n            daily_avg = 19.734583 + day_index * 0.93375\n            for hour in range(24):\n                deviation = avg_deviations[hour]   # which we computed above\n                value = daily_avg + deviation\n                forecasts.append(round(value, 6))   # then we'll format to 3 decimals? but the original had 3 to 6 decimals? \n\n        But note: the original data had 3 to 6 decimal places? Actually, they are floats with 3 decimal places? But we see 14.421000 -> so 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 44. However, note: the original data had 6 digits after the decimal? But the last three are zeros? So we can output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 45. We'll output as float with 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. Let me list the avg_deviations we computed:\n\n        hour0: -1.642625\n        hour1: -1.466375\n        hour2: -1.836125\n        hour3: -1.888375\n        hour4: -1.924125\n        hour5: -2.029125\n        hour6: -2.029375\n        hour7: -0.903625\n        hour8: -0.340875\n        hour9: -0.393625\n        hour10: -0.200125\n        hour11: -0.041875\n        hour12: 0.256875\n        hour13: 1.364875\n        hour14: 2.068375\n        hour15: 2.754375\n        hour16: 2.877625\n        hour17: 1.910125\n        hour18: 0.608875\n        hour19: 0.151375\n        hour20: 0.010875\n        hour21: -0.147625\n        hour22: -0.288125\n        hour23: -0.587125\n\n 47.

We'll write a loop to generate all 96.\n\n 49. But note: we must output the dates in the format as the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 50. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        start = '2017-08-25 00:00:00'\n        then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 51. We'll code the generation.\n\n 52. However, we are to output in the answer block.\n\n 53. We'll write the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-25 00:00:00 18.092\n2017-08-25 01:00:00 18.268\n...\n2017-08-28 23:00:00 ... \n```\n\n 54. We'll compute the values for the next 4 days.\n\n 55. Let me do the first day and then the rest similarly.\n\n 56. We'll create a list of the average deviations for each hour (0 to 23) in order.\n\n        avg_devs = [\n            -1.642625, -1.466375, -1.836125, -1.888375, -1.924125, -2.029125, -2.029375, -0.903625, \n            -0.340875, -0.393625, -0.200125, -0.041875, 0.256875, 1.364875, 2.068375, 2.754375, \n            2.877625, 1.910125, 0.608875, 0.151375, 0.010875, -0.147625, -0.288125, -0.587125\n        ]\n\n 57. The daily averages for the next 4 days:\n\n        daily_avgs = [19.734583, 20.668333, 21.602083, 22.535833]\n\n 58. Then for day_index in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            value = daily_avgs[day_index] + avg_devs[hour]\n            # round to 3 decimal places\n            value_rounded = round(value, 3)\n\n 59. We'll generate the date string:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017, 8, 25) + timedelta(days=day_index)\n        then for each hour: base_date + timedelta(hours=hour)\n\n        But note: base_date for day_index=0 is 2017-08-25, then we add hours.\n\n 60. Alternatively, we can generate a list of 96 consecutive hours starting from '2017-08-25 00:00:00'\n\n 61. We'll do:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 8, 25, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 62. Then the values:\n\n        values = []\n        for day in range(4):\n            base = daily_avgs[day]\n            for dev in avg_devs:\n                values.append(round(base + dev, 3))\n\n 63. Then we have 96 values.\n\n 64. We'll output:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            date_str = dates[i].strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            value = values[i]\n            print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")\n\n 65. But note: the original data had 6 decimal places? But they were all zeros after 3. So we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 66. However, the original data had 6 decimal places? Example: 14.421000 -> so we output with 3 decimal places and then add three zeros? \n\n    But the problem does not specify the format. The example output was:\n\n        2017-08-21 00:00:00 14.421000\n\n    So we should output 6 decimal places? \n\n    We can output as: f\"{date_str} {value:.6f}\"\n\n    But note: we rounded to 3 decimal places, so we can do: f\"{value:.3f}000\" -> that would be wrong.\n\n    Alternatively, we can output with 6 decimal places by formatting the float to have 6 digits.\n\n    We can do: f\"{value:.6f}\" -> but if we rounded to 3, then the last three will be zeros.\n\n    So we'll do: round(value, 3) and then format to 6 decimal places? \n\n    Actually, we can do: \"{:.6f}\".format(round(value, 3)) -> but that will add zeros.\n\n    Example: round(18.091958, 3) = 18.092 -> then format to 6 decimal: 18.092000\n\n    But the original data had 14.421000 -> so that matches.\n\n 67. So we'll output: \n        for each row: f\"{date_str} {value:.6f}\"\n\n    But note: we computed value as rounded to 3 decimal places? Then we can do:\n\n        value = round(base + dev, 3)   # this gives 3 decimal places\n        then format to string with 6 decimal places: format_string = \"{:.3f}\".format(value) -> then we can add three zeros? \n\n    Alternatively, we can do: \n        formatted_value = \"{:.6f}\".format(value)   # but if value has 3 decimals, it will add three zeros.\n\n    But note: the rounding might have more than 3? We rounded to 3, so it has at most 3.\n\n 68. We'll do:\n\n        value = base + dev   # then round to 6 decimal places? but we want 3 significant decimals? \n\n    Actually, we can round to 3 decimal places and then output with 6 by formatting.\n\n    Example: \n        x = 18.091958\n        x_rounded = round(x, 3) -> 18.092\n        then format to 6: format(x_rounded, '.6f') -> '18.092000'\n\n 69. So we'll compute the unrounded value, then round to 3 decimal places, then format to 6.\n\n 70. Code:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        # avg_devs as above\n        avg_devs = [-1.642625, -1.466375, -1.836125, -1.888375, ...]   # we have the list\n\n        daily_avgs = [19.734583, 20.668333, 21.602083, 22.535833]\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 8, 25, 0, 0, 0)\n        values = []\n        for day_avg in daily_avgs:\n            for dev in avg_devs:\n                # Calculate the value and round to 3 decimal places\n                temp = round(day_avg + dev, 3)\n                values.append(temp)\n\n        # Now generate the date strings and the value strings\n        result = []\n        for i in range(96):\n            dt = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            date_str = dt.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            # Format the value to have 6 decimal places (with trailing zeros if needed)\n            value_str = \"{:.6f}\".format(values[i])\n            result.append(f\"{date_str} {value_str}\")\n\n 71. Then we output the result.\n\n 72. But note: we must be cautious of the order of the avg_devs: it is for hour0, hour1, ... hour23.\n\n 73. We'll write the result.\n\n 74. However, we are not allowed to run code? We have to do manually? \n\n 75. We'll do the first day and then the rest similarly.\n\n 76. We have the first day (2017-08-25) computed above.\n\n 77. We'll compute the next days similarly.\n\n 78. We'll do:\n\n        Day5: 2017-08-25: daily_avg=19.734583\n        Day6: 2017-08-26: daily_avg=20.668333\n        Day7: 2017-08-27: daily_avg=21.602083\n        Day8: 2017-08-28: daily_avg=22.535833\n\n 79. We'll compute for each hour in each day.\n\n 80. We'll write the full 96 lines.\n\n 81. But note: the answer must be in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-25 00:00:00 18.092000\n2017-08-25 01:00:00 18.268000\n...\n```\n\n 82.
