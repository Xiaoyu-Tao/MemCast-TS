        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method that can handle potential seasonality and trends. Given the data is hourly, we might have:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Weekly seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly. We'll focus on daily.\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that can capture seasonality.\n\n 5. We'll use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might have non-constant patterns. Let's observe the data:\n\n    - The data shows fluctuations within each day, with some peaks during the day and lower values at night? \n    - But looking at the values, we see on 2017-04-12 there is a peak at 11:00 (5.827) and 12:00 (3.014) and then again at 13:00 and 14:00.\n\n 7. Since we are only given 4 days, we can assume daily seasonality (24 periods). But 4 days might be too short to capture seasonality.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple method like last value carried forward, or moving average, but that might not capture the pattern.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can use a model like ExponentialSmoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or a simple SARIMA model.\n\n 10. We'll use the following approach:\n     - Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n     - If we have seasonality, use a seasonal model.\n\n 11. However, note: we are not allowed to output incomplete data. We must provide 96 points.\n\n 12. Given the constraints of the problem (only 96 points to train) and the need to forecast 96 points, we might use a simple model.\n\n 13. We can use a naive seasonal model: for each hour in the day, we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n     But note: the pattern might change. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-04-14) and repeat it 4 times? But that would be too naive.\n\n 14. Another idea: use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form a daily profile, then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n 15. However, we see that the data is not exactly repeating. For example, the peak on 2017-04-12 is much higher than other days.\n\n 16. We can try to model with SARIMA. But with only 96 points, fitting a complex SARIMA model might be challenging.\n\n 17. Given the time and simplicity, we can use the following:\n\n     - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual using moving averages (with a window of 24 hours for seasonality).\n     - Then forecast the trend component using a simple linear regression or ARIMA, and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 18. However, we are required to provide the data and we cannot run code here. We have to simulate the forecast.\n\n 19. Considering the above, we decide to use a simple method: \n     We will use the average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day to form a daily pattern, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps:\n        a. Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n        b. For each hour, compute the average of the 4 days.\n        c. Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00), we assign the average value for that hour.\n\n 20. Why this method?\n     - It captures the daily seasonality.\n     - It is simple and we have exactly 4 days of history.\n\n 21. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a long-term trend. We are only capturing the daily pattern.\n\n 22. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (1.875 + 0.670 + 1.808 + 1.340) / 4 = (1.693+1.808+1.340+0.670) -> let me calculate:\n\n        2017-04-11 00:00:00  1.875\n        2017-04-12 00:00:00  0.670\n        2017-04-13 00:00:00  1.808\n        2017-04-14 00:00:00  1.340\n        Average = (1.875 + 0.670 + 1.808 + 1.340) / 4 = 5.693 / 4 = 1.42325\n\n     Hour 1: \n        1.407, 1.005, 0.603, 0.938 -> (1.407+1.005+0.603+0.938)/4 = 3.953/4 = 0.98825\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 23. Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 24. The next day after 2017-04-14 is 2017-04-15. So we start from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We must generate 96 points.\n\n 26. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 27. We'll generate the next 96 points by repeating the computed daily pattern 4 times.\n\n 28. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n        hour0: (1.875 + 0.670 + 1.808 + 1.340) / 4 = 1.42325\n        hour1: (1.407 + 1.005 + 0.603 + 0.938) / 4 = (1.407+1.005=2.412; 2.412+0.603=3.015; 3.015+0.938=3.953) -> 3.953/4=0.98825\n        hour2: (1.541 + 1.206 + 1.674 + 0.603) / 4 = (1.541+1.206=2.747; 2.747+1.674=4.421; 4.421+0.603=5.024) -> 5.024/4=1.256\n        hour3: (1.340 + 0.469 + 1.808 + 0.536) / 4 = (1.340+0.469=1.809; 1.809+1.808=3.617; 3.617+0.536=4.153) -> 4.153/4=1.03825\n        hour4: (0.737 + 0.670 + 1.674 + 0.335) / 4 = (0.737+0.670=1.407; 1.407+1.674=3.081; 3.081+0.335=3.416) -> 3.416/4=0.854\n        hour5: (0.804 + 0.737 + 1.139 + 1.273) / 4 = (0.804+0.737=1.541; 1.541+1.139=2.68; 2.68+1.273=3.953) -> 3.953/4=0.98825\n        hour6: (1.541 + 1.608 + 1.139 + 0.134) / 4 = (1.541+1.608=3.149; 3.149+1.139=4.288; 4.288+0.134=4.422) -> 4.422/4=1.1055\n        hour7: (0.804 + 1.407 + 2.545 + 1.608) / 4 = (0.804+1.407=2.211; 2.211+2.545=4.756; 4.756+1.608=6.364) -> 6.364/4=1.591\n        hour8: (2.210 + 2.143 + 3.148 + 2.411) / 4 = (2.210+2.143=4.353; 4.353+3.148=7.501; 7.501+2.411=9.912) -> 9.912/4=2.478\n        hour9: (0.067 + 1.005 + 2.210 + 3.215) / 4 = (0.067+1.005=1.072; 1.072+2.210=3.282; 3.282+3.215=6.497) -> 6.497/4=1.62425\n        hour10: (-0.067 + 2.545 + 3.014 + 2.679) / 4 = (-0.067+2.545=2.478; 2.478+3.014=5.492; 5.492+2.679=8.171) -> 8.171/4=2.04275\n        hour11: (0.804 + 5.827 + 3.081 + 4.555) / 4 = (0.804+5.827=6.631; 6.631+3.081=9.712; 9.712+4.555=14.267) -> 14.267/4=3.56675\n        hour12: (-0.335 + 3.014 + 4.019 + 3.014) / 4 = (-0.335+3.014=2.679; 2.679+4.019=6.698; 6.698+3.014=9.712) -> 9.712/4=2.428\n        hour13: (2.210 + 3.148 + 2.947 + 3.483) / 4 = (2.210+3.148=5.358; 5.358+2.947=8.305; 8.305+3.483=11.788) -> 11.788/4=2.947\n        hour14: (0.469 + 3.349 + 3.483 + 3.751) / 4 = (0.469+3.349=3.818; 3.818+3.483=7.301; 7.301+3.751=11.052) -> 11.052/4=2.763\n        hour15: (0.000 + 1.942 + 2.880 + 2.344) / 4 = (0.000+1.942=1.942; 1.942+2.880=4.822; 4.822+2.344=7.166) -> 7.166/4=1.7915\n        hour16: (-0.134 + 0.402 + 0.670 + 1.608) / 4 = (-0.134+0.402=0.268; 0.268+0.670=0.938; 0.938+1.608=2.546) -> 2.546/4=0.6365\n        hour17: (-0.067 + 0.067 + (-0.134) + 0.402) / 4 = (-0.067+0.067=0; 0-0.134=-0.134; -0.134+0.402=0.268) -> 0.268/4=0.067\n        hour18: (-1.072 + (-0.603) + (-1.005) + (-0.402)) / 4 = (-1.072-0.603=-1.675; -1.675-1.005=-2.68; -2.68-0.402=-3.082) -> -3.082/4 = -0.7705\n        hour19: (-1.005 + (-1.005) + (-1.072) + (-0.201)) / 4 = (-1.005-1.005=-2.01; -2.01-1.072=-3.082; -3.082-0.201=-3.283) -> -3.283/4 = -0.82075\n        hour20: (-1.072 + (-0.670) + (-0.871) + (-0.201)) / 4 = (-1.072-0.670=-1.742; -1.742-0.871=-2.613; -2.613-0.201=-2.814) -> -2.814/4 = -0.7035\n        hour21: (-1.407 + (-1.474) + (-0.871) + (-0.737)) / 4 = (-1.407-1.474=-2.881; -2.881-0.871=-3.752; -3.752-0.737=-4.489) -> -4.489/4 = -1.12225\n        hour22: (-0.603 + (-0.134) + (-0.603) + 0.670) / 4 = (-0.603-0.134=-0.737; -0.737-0.603=-1.340; -1.340+0.670=-0.67) -> -0.67/4 = -0.1675\n        hour23: (-0.536 + 0.000 + (-0.134) + 1.139) / 4 = (-0.536+0.000=-0.536; -0.536-0.134=-0.67; -0.67+1.139=0.469) -> 0.469/4 = 0.11725\n\n 29. Now, we create the next 4 days (2017-04-15 to 2017-04-18) by repeating the above 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 30. The dates will be:\n\n        2017-04-15 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.42325\n        2017-04-15 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.98825\n        ... until 2017-04-15 23:00:00: 0.11725\n        then 2017-04-16 00:00:00: 1.42325, and so on.\n\n 31. We output the data in the same format as the input, with the date and the HULL value.\n\n 32. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 33. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-15 00:00:00  1.42325\n2017-04-15 01:00:00  0.98825\n2017-04-15 02:00:00  1.256\n2017-04-15 03:00:00  1.03825\n2017-04-15 04:00:00  0.854\n2017-04-15 05:00:00  0.98825\n2017-04-15 06:00:00  1.1055\n2017-04-15 07:00:00  1.591\n2017-04-15 08:00:00  2.478\n2017-04-15 09:00:00  1.62425\n2017-04-15 10:00:00  2.04275\n2017-04-15 11:00:00  3.56675\n2017-04-15 12:00:00  2.428\n2017-04-15 13:00:00  2.947\n2017-04-15 14:00:00  2.763\n2017-04-15 15:00:00  1.7915\n2017-04-15 16:00:00  0.6365\n2017-04-15 17:00:00  0.067\n2017-04-15 18:00:00  -0.7705\n2017-04-15 19:00:00  -0.82075\n2017-04-15 20:00:00  -0.7035\n2017-04-15 21:00:00  -1.12225\n2017-04-15 22:00:00  -0.1675\n2017-04-15 23:00:00  0.11725\n... and then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 34. We'll generate the next 3 days by repeating the same 24 values.\n\n 35. We must be cautious: the dates must be consecutive and in hourly steps.\n\n 36. We start from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 and go to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n\n 37. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 38. We output the data in the same format, with the same number of decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. Let's round the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n        hour0: 1.423 -> 1.423 (if we round to 3 decimals, but note: 1.42325 -> 1.423? but 1.42325 rounded to 3 decimals is 1.423)\n        However, the input had up to 3 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places for most, but some had 2 or 3? \n        We see: 1.875, 1.407, ... so we'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll round each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n 40. Rounding:\n\n        hour0: 1.42325 -> 1.423\n        hour1: 0.98825 -> 0.988\n        hour2: 1.256 -> 1.256\n        ... and so on.\n\n 41. But note: some of our averages are negative? We round similarly.\n\n 42. We recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: 1.423\n        hour1: 0.988\n        hour2: 1.256\n        hour3: 1.038\n        hour4: 0.854\n        hour5: 0.988\n        hour6: 1.1055 -> 1.106 (rounding: 1.1055 is exactly halfway? but 5 or above, so 1.106)\n        hour7: 1.591\n        hour8: 2.478\n        hour9: 1.62425 -> 1.624\n        hour10: 2.04275 -> 2.043\n        hour11: 3.56675 -> 3.567\n        hour12: 2.428\n        hour13: 2.947\n        hour14: 2.763\n        hour15: 1.7915 -> 1.792\n        hour16: 0.6365 -> 0.637\n        hour17: 0.067\n        hour18: -0.7705 -> -0.770 (if we round to 3 decimals, then -0.771? Let me check: 0.7705 rounded to 3 decimals is 0.771, so negative: -0.771)\n        hour19: -0.82075 -> -0.821\n        hour20: -0.7035 -> -0.704\n        hour21: -1.12225 -> -1.122\n        hour22: -0.1675 -> -0.168\n        hour23: 0.11725 -> 0.117\n\n 43. But note: rounding rules: \n        For hour6: 1.1055 -> the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up -> 1.106\n        For hour15: 1.7915 -> 1.792\n        For hour16: 0.6365 -> 0.637\n        For hour18: -0.7705 -> \n            The absolute value is 0.7705, which rounds to 0.771, so the negative is -0.771.\n        For hour19: -0.82075 -> \n            The fourth decimal is 7, which is above 5, so we round up the third decimal: 0.82075 -> 0.821, so negative: -0.821.\n        For hour20: -0.7035 -> \n            0.7035 -> 0.704 (because 5 rounds up) -> -0.704\n        For hour21: -1.12225 -> \n            0.12225 -> 0.122 (because the fourth decimal is 2, which is less than 5) -> -1.122\n        For hour22: -0.1675 -> \n            0.1675 -> 0.168 (because 5 rounds up) -> -0.168\n        For hour23: 0.11725 -> 0.117\n\n 44. Let me recompute the rounding for each:\n\n        hour0: 1.42325 -> 1.423\n        hour1: 0.98825 -> 0.988\n        hour2: 1.256 -> 1.256\n        hour3: 1.03825 -> 1.038\n        hour4: 0.854 -> 0.854\n        hour5: 0.98825 -> 0.988\n        hour6: 1.1055 -> 1.106\n        hour7: 1.591 -> 1.591\n        hour8: 2.478 -> 2.478\n        hour9: 1.62425 -> 1.624\n        hour10: 2.04275 -> 2.043\n        hour11: 3.56675 -> 3.567\n        hour12: 2.428 -> 2.428\n        hour13: 2.947 -> 2.947\n        hour14: 2.763 -> 2.763\n        hour15: 1.7915 -> 1.792\n        hour16: 0.6365 -> 0.637\n        hour17: 0.067 -> 0.067\n        hour18: -0.7705 -> -0.771\n        hour19: -0.82075 -> -0.821\n        hour20: -0.7035 -> -0.704\n        hour21: -1.12225 -> -1.122\n        hour22: -0.1675 -> -0.168\n        hour23: 0.11725 -> 0.117\n\n 45. Now we create the data for 4 days.\n\n 46. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-15 00:00:00  1.423\n2017-04-15 01:00:00  0.988\n2017-04-15 02:00:00  1.256\n2017-04-15 03:00:00  1.038\n2017-04-15 04:00:00  0.854\n2017-04-15 05:00:00  0.988\n2017-04-15 06:00:00  1.106\n2017-04-15 07:00:00  1.591\n2017-04-15 08:00:00  2.478\n2017-04-15 09:00:00  1.624\n2017-04-15 10:00:00  2.043\n2017-04-15 11:00:00  3.567\n2017-04-15 12:00:00  2.428\n2017-04-15 13:00:00  2.947\n2017-04-15 14:00:00  2.763\n2017-04-15 15:00:00  1.792\n2017-04-15 16:00:00  0.637\n2017-04-15 17:00:00  0.067\n2017-04-15 18:00:00  -0.771\n2017-04-15 19:00:00  -0.821\n2017-04-15 20:00:00  -0.704\n2017-04-15 21:00:00  -1.122\n2017-04-15 22:00:00  -0.168\n2017-04-15 23:00:00  0.117\n2017-04-16 00:00:00  1.423\n2017-04-16 01:00:00  0.988\n... until 2017-04-18 23:00:00\n\n 47. We'll generate 4 days.\n\n 48. We note that the last date in the input is 2017-04-14 23:00:00, so the next day is 2017-04-15.\n\n 49. We output 96 lines.\n\n 50. We write the code block accordingly.\n\n 51. We must be careful: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 52. We generate:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-15\n        Day2: 2017-04-16\n        Day3: 2017-04-17\n        Day4: 2017-04-18\n\n 53. We output the data.\n\n 54. We note: the method is simple and might not capture trends, but with only 4 days of data, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 55. We output the data in the required format.\n",
