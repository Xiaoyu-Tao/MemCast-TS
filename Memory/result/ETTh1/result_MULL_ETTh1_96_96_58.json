        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00).\n\n Since the data has missing values (though in the provided 96 points we don't see any missing, we must be cautious for the future),\n we will use a time series model that can handle missing data or we will impute if necessary. However, for forecasting, we assume the model can predict without gaps.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note the data is hourly and has a potential daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly (168 hours) but we only have 4 days (96 hours) so weekly is not visible.\n 2. We will use a model that can capture seasonality. Given the small data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) but with such a short history, it might be challenging.\n 3. Alternatively, we can use a simple model like a seasonal naive or an average, but that might not capture the patterns.\n\n However, note: the data provided has 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours). The data shows a clear daily pattern.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data is short, we can use a model that uses the daily pattern. We can try to decompose the series and then forecast.\n\n But note: the data has negative values and the pattern is not very clear. We see that each day has a similar pattern: \n   - The load is more negative during the night (especially around 18:00 to 22:00) and less negative or positive during the day.\n\n However, the values vary from day to day.\n\n Given the constraints, we must provide 96 forecasted values without any gaps.\n\n We can use:\n   - A simple method: take the average of each hour across the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the last day (2017-02-21) seems to have more negative values? \n   - However, 4 days is too short to determine a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-21) as the base and adjust by the average change from one day to the next? \n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing. So we can proceed.\n\n Considering the requirement for simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can do:\n\n   Let H be the hour of the day (0 to 23). We have 4 days of data for each hour.\n\n   For each hour H (0 to 23), we compute the average of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the data shows that the pattern is not exactly the same every day? We see a drift? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for each hour.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the method. We are an expert, so we choose a method that is robust and simple.\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, we cannot build a complex model. We will use the average by hour.\n\n Steps for the average by hour:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour from the timestamp for each record.\n   Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n   Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   Example: \n        Hour 00:00:00: average of the 4 days at 00:00:00 -> (-0.817, -0.249, -0.462, -0.320) -> let's compute: \n            (-0.817 -0.249 -0.462 -0.320)/4 = (-1.848)/4 = -0.462\n\n        Then for 2017-02-22 00:00:00: -0.462\n            2017-02-23 00:00:00: -0.462\n            2017-02-24 00:00:00: -0.462\n            2017-02-25 00:00:00: -0.462\n\n   Similarly for each hour.\n\n But note: the data might have a slight trend? We are ignoring the trend. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to model a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-21) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences between consecutive days? \n   However, that might be more complex and we only have 3 differences.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 values, we go with the hourly average.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We have 24 hours. We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n   We note the data:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-18 (Saturday? but we don't have weekday info) -> 24 hours\n        Day 2: 2017-02-19 -> 24 hours\n        Day 3: 2017-02-20 -> 24 hours\n        Day 4: 2017-02-21 -> 24 hours\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour0: [ -0.817, -0.249, -0.462, -0.320 ] -> average = (-0.817 -0.249 -0.462 -0.320)/4 = (-1.848)/4 = -0.462\n        hour1: [ -0.462, -0.107, -0.959, -0.533 ] -> (-0.462 -0.107 -0.959 -0.533) = (-2.061)/4 = -0.51525\n        hour2: [ -0.249, -0.213, -0.284, -0.924 ] -> (-0.249 -0.213 -0.284 -0.924) = (-1.67)/4 = -0.4175\n        hour3: [ -0.533, -1.066, -2.345, -0.533 ] -> (-0.533 -1.066 -2.345 -0.533) = (-4.477)/4 = -1.11925\n        hour4: [ -0.746, 0.178, -0.924, -0.533 ] -> (-0.746+0.178-0.924-0.533) = (-2.025)/4 = -0.50625\n        hour5: [ -0.355, -0.711, -2.487, 0.000 ] -> (-0.355-0.711-2.487+0.000) = (-3.553)/4 = -0.88825\n        hour6: [ -0.142, -1.635, -2.381, -1.244 ] -> (-0.142-1.635-2.381-1.244) = (-5.402)/4 = -1.3505\n        hour7: [ -1.137, -1.102, -2.025, -0.284 ] -> (-1.137-1.102-2.025-0.284) = (-4.548)/4 = -1.137\n        hour8: [ -0.888, -0.213, -1.741, -0.355 ] -> (-0.888-0.213-1.741-0.355) = (-3.197)/4 = -0.79925\n        hour9: [ -0.675, -1.315, -2.949, -1.031 ] -> (-0.675-1.315-2.949-1.031) = (-5.97)/4 = -1.4925\n        hour10: [ -0.391, -0.782, -1.102, -1.599 ] -> (-0.391-0.782-1.102-1.599) = (-3.874)/4 = -0.9685\n        hour11: [ 0.249, 0.000, -1.990, -1.990 ] -> (0.249+0.000-1.990-1.990) = (-3.731)/4 = -0.93275\n        hour12: [ -0.178, -0.533, -2.203, -0.782 ] -> (-0.178-0.533-2.203-0.782) = (-3.696)/4 = -0.924\n        hour13: [ 0.462, 0.391, -1.564, -1.564 ] -> (0.462+0.391-1.564-1.564) = (-2.275)/4 = -0.56875\n        hour14: [ 0.071, -0.853, -1.599, -1.102 ] -> (0.071-0.853-1.599-1.102) = (-3.483)/4 = -0.87075\n        hour15: [ -0.746, -1.208, -1.315, -1.777 ] -> (-0.746-1.208-1.315-1.777) = (-5.046)/4 = -1.2615\n        hour16: [ -0.817, -1.990, -1.457, -2.274 ] -> (-0.817-1.990-1.457-2.274) = (-6.538)/4 = -1.6345\n        hour17: [ -1.670, -1.670, -1.883, -2.381 ] -> (-1.670-1.670-1.883-2.381) = (-7.604)/4 = -1.901\n        hour18: [ -2.061, -2.807, -2.168, -2.807 ] -> (-2.061-2.807-2.168-2.807) = (-9.843)/4 = -2.46075\n        hour19: [ -2.239, -2.274, -2.203, -2.274 ] -> (-2.239-2.274-2.203-2.274) = (-8.99)/4 = -2.2475\n        hour20: [ -2.239, -2.772, -1.883, -2.594 ] -> (-2.239-2.772-1.883-2.594) = (-9.488)/4 = -2.372\n        hour21: [ -3.376, -2.310, -2.630, -3.909 ] -> (-3.376-2.310-2.630-3.909) = (-12.225)/4 = -3.05625\n        hour22: [ -1.315, -0.284, -1.279, -2.452 ] -> (-1.315-0.284-1.279-2.452) = (-5.33)/4 = -1.3325\n        hour23: [ 0.497, -1.208, -0.284, -1.102 ] -> (0.497-1.208-0.284-1.102) = (-2.097)/4 = -0.52425\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-02-22 to 2017-02-25), we assign:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-22: [hour0: -0.462, hour1: -0.51525, ... , hour23: -0.52425]\n        Day 2: 2017-02-23: same as above\n        Day 3: 2017-02-24: same as above\n        Day 4: 2017-02-25: same as above\n\n   So the forecast for the next 96 hours is the 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 consecutive days (which? from Saturday to Tuesday?).\n   Without more data, we cannot account for weekly seasonality.\n\n Therefore, we use the above.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. But if in the future we are to forecast and there are missing, we would have to impute. However, for this forecast we are generating without gaps.\n\n We'll generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2017-02-22 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2017-02-21 23:00:00)\n\n   We'll create a sequence of 96 timestamps: \n        2017-02-22 00:00:00, 2017-02-22 01:00:00, ... , 2017-02-22 23:00:00, \n        2017-02-23 00:00:00, ... , 2017-02-23 23:00:00,\n        ... until 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n   And assign the corresponding hourly average.\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   The computed averages:\n\n        hour0: -0.462 -> -0.462\n        hour1: -0.51525 -> -0.515\n        hour2: -0.4175 -> -0.418\n        hour3: -1.11925 -> -1.119\n        hour4: -0.50625 -> -0.506\n        hour5: -0.88825 -> -0.888\n        hour6: -1.3505 -> -1.351\n        hour7: -1.137 -> -1.137\n        hour8: -0.79925 -> -0.799\n        hour9: -1.4925 -> -1.493\n        hour10: -0.9685 -> -0.969\n        hour11: -0.93275 -> -0.933\n        hour12: -0.924 -> -0.924\n        hour13: -0.56875 -> -0.569\n        hour14: -0.87075 -> -0.871\n        hour15: -1.2615 -> -1.262\n        hour16: -1.6345 -> -1.635\n        hour17: -1.901 -> -1.901\n        hour18: -2.46075 -> -2.461\n        hour19: -2.2475 -> -2.248\n        hour20: -2.372 -> -2.372\n        hour21: -3.05625 -> -3.056\n        hour22: -1.3325 -> -1.333\n        hour23: -0.52425 -> -0.524\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast period, we assign these 24 values.\n\n   Example for 2017-02-22:\n        00:00:00 -> -0.462\n        01:00:00 -> -0.515\n        ... \n        23:00:00 -> -0.524\n\n   And then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00, -0.462\n        2017-02-22 01:00:00, -0.515\n        2017-02-22 02:00:00, -0.418\n        2017-02-22 03:00:00, -1.119\n        2017-02-22 04:00:00, -0.506\n        2017-02-22 05:00:00, -0.888\n        2017-02-22 06:00:00, -1.351\n        2017-02-22 07:00:00, -1.137\n        2017-02-22 08:00:00, -0.799\n        2017-02-22 09:00:00, -1.493\n        2017-02-22 10:00:00, -0.969\n        2017-02-22 11:00:00, -0.933\n        2017-02-22 12:00:00, -0.924\n        2017-02-22 13:00:00, -0.569\n        2017-02-22 14:00:00, -0.871\n        2017-02-22 15:00:00, -1.262\n        2017-02-22 16:00:00, -1.635\n        2017-02-22 17:00:00, -1.901\n        2017-02-22 18:00:00, -2.461\n        2017-02-22 19:00:00, -2.248\n        2017-02-22 20:00:00, -2.372\n        2017-02-22 21:00:00, -3.056\n        2017-02-22 22:00:00, -1.333\n        2017-02-22 23:00:00, -0.524\n\n   Then 2017-02-23 00:00:00: -0.462, and so on.\n\n We'll generate 96 points accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values.
