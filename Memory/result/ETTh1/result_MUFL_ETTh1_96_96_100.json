        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also there might be weekly patterns but we only have 4 days.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided data, we have 24*4=96 points without gaps. So for the given data, we can proceed without imputation for the historical part.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, which would be from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that handles seasonality. Since the data is hourly and we have daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might have non-stationary patterns and the level changes. We can try to use a model that captures the seasonality and the level.\n\n 7. We can use the following approach:\n    - Use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be unstable.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour across the available days and then adjust for the level? But that would assume that the pattern is exactly repeating and the level is constant.\n\n 9. Another idea: use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality. But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be well estimated.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n      Forecast for the next day (24 hours) is the same as the last available day (2017-08-08) but adjusted by the trend? \n      Or we can use the average of each hour over the 4 days? \n\n 11. However, looking at the data, there is a clear pattern each day: \n      - The values are higher during the night (midnight to early morning) and then drop during the day (especially in the morning) and then rise again in the evening.\n\n 12. But the level of each day is changing. For example, the values on 2017-08-05 are generally lower than on 2017-08-08? \n\n 13. We can compute the average for each day and then adjust the seasonal pattern by the level of the last day? \n\n 14. Steps for a simple forecast:\n      a. Compute the seasonal indices (hourly) by averaging the same hour across the 4 days.\n      b. Compute the base level for the last day (2017-08-08): we can take the average of that day.\n      c. Then the forecast for a given hour in the next day is: seasonal index for that hour * (level of last day / average of the seasonal indices for the day) \n      But this might be too simplistic.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-08) as the pattern and then adjust by the trend of the daily averages? \n\n 16. Let's compute the daily averages:\n      Day1 (2017-08-05): average = (14.214+13.326+...+8.884)/24 -> we can calculate roughly: \n          We can see the values: from 14.214 down to -10.127 and then up to 8.884 -> average might be around 3? \n      Actually, we can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n          sum = 14.214+13.326+11.229+12.117+10.376+10.234+9.879+5.366+0.640-5.010-5.721-8.635-10.127-9.452-8.955+3.198-0.888+3.411+7.178+9.310+11.620+10.661+9.559+8.884\n          = 14.214+13.326=27.54, +11.229=38.769, +12.117=50.886, +10.376=61.262, +10.234=71.496, +9.879=81.375, +5.366=86.741, +0.640=87.381, -5.010=82.371, -5.721=76.65, -8.635=68.015, -10.127=57.888, -9.452=48.436, -8.955=39.481, +3.198=42.679, -0.888=41.791, +3.411=45.202, +7.178=52.38, +9.310=61.69, +11.620=73.31, +10.661=83.971, +9.559=93.53, +8.884=102.414\n          average = 102.414 / 24 = 4.26725\n\n        Day2: \n          ... we don't need to do by hand. We can note that the data is provided and we can use code, but since we are not coding, we can approximate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a model that doesn't require daily averages.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and the small data, we can use a seasonal naive forecast: \n        y_{t+24} = y_t   for the first day of forecast? But we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n        We can set:\n          For the next 24 hours (2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-09 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-08-08 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n          Then for the next day (2017-08-10) use the same as 2017-08-08? or use the values from 2017-08-05? \n\n        But the pattern might be changing. The last day is the most recent, so we can use the last day (2017-08-08) for the pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n        However, the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided data we don't have missing values. So we can use the last day as the pattern.\n\n        But note: the last day (2017-08-08) has a pattern that is different from the previous days? \n\n        Let's look at the last day:\n\n          2017-08-08 00:00:00  13.361\n          2017-08-08 01:00:00  11.869\n          2017-08-08 02:00:00  13.645\n          2017-08-08 03:00:00  10.909\n          2017-08-08 04:00:00  12.295\n          2017-08-08 05:00:00  12.331\n          2017-08-08 06:00:00  11.371\n          2017-08-08 07:00:00  10.376\n          2017-08-08 08:00:00   6.823\n          2017-08-08 09:00:00   5.295\n          2017-08-08 10:00:00   5.366\n          2017-08-08 11:00:00   4.868\n          2017-08-08 12:00:00  -4.087   -> This is an anomaly? because the next value is 4.726 at 13:00? \n          2017-08-08 13:00:00   4.726\n          2017-08-08 14:00:00   0.284\n          2017-08-08 15:00:00   2.168\n          2017-08-08 16:00:00   4.762\n          2017-08-08 17:00:00   4.975\n          2017-08-08 18:00:00   4.371\n          2017-08-08 19:00:00   4.442\n          2017-08-08 20:00:00   5.437\n          2017-08-08 21:00:00   5.010\n          2017-08-08 22:00:00   5.259\n          2017-08-08 23:00:00   5.330\n\n        The value at 12:00 is -4.087 which is an outlier? or a data entry error? But we are not told to change the data.\n\n        Since we are to forecast, we can use the last day as the pattern, but we must be cautious.\n\n        However, the requirement is to provide the next 96 points. We can use the last day (2017-08-08) repeated 4 times? \n\n        But the problem says the data has missing values? We are not have missing in the provided history, but the future might have? But we are to provide the next 96 without missing? \n\n        We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must fill all 96.\n\n 18. Given the above, I propose to use the last day (2017-08-08) as the pattern for the next 4 days. So:\n\n        Day1 of forecast (2017-08-09): same as 2017-08-08\n        Day2 (2017-08-10): same as 2017-08-08\n        Day3 (2017-08-11): same as 2017-08-08\n        Day4 (2017-08-12): same as 2017-08-08\n\n 19. But note: the date must be generated correctly. The last date in the given data is 2017-08-08 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-09 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We will generate the next 96 points by repeating the last 24 hours (2017-08-08) four times.\n\n 21. However, this method ignores any trend and the fact that the level of the time series might be changing. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use a moving average to smooth the seasonal pattern and then adjust by the last day's level? But again, we have limited data.\n\n 23. Considering the requirement and simplicity, and the fact that the last day is the most recent, we will use the last day repeated 4 times.\n\n 24. The forecasted values:\n\n        First 24 hours (2017-08-09): \n          00:00:00 -> 13.361\n          01:00:00 -> 11.869\n          02:00:00 -> 13.645\n          03:00:00 -> 10.909\n          04:00:00 -> 12.295\n          05:00:00 -> 12.331\n          06:00:00 -> 11.371\n          07:00:00 -> 10.376\n          08:00:00 -> 6.823\n          09:00:00 -> 5.295\n          10:00:00 -> 5.366\n          11:00:00 -> 4.868\n          12:00:00 -> -4.087\n          13:00:00 -> 4.726\n          14:00:00 -> 0.284\n          15:00:00 -> 2.168\n          16:00:00 -> 4.762\n          17:00:00 -> 4.975\n          18:00:00 -> 4.371\n          19:00:00 -> 4.442\n          20:00:00 -> 5.437\n          21:00:00 -> 5.010\n          22:00:00 -> 5.259\n          23:00:00 -> 5.330\n\n        Then the next day (2017-08-10) same values, and so on.\n\n 25. But note: the value at 12:00 on 2017-08-08 is -4.087, which is an outlier? But we are repeating it. \n\n 26. We are not change the historical data, and we are to forecast. So we will repeat the pattern as is.\n\n 27. We generate the next 96 points by repeating the last 24 points 4 times.\n\n 28. The dates: \n        Start: 2017-08-09 00:00:00, then 2017-08-09 01:00:00 ... until 2017-08-09 23:00:00 -> 24 points\n        Then 2017-08-10 00:00:00 to 2017-08-10 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-08-11 00:00:00 to 2017-08-11 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-08-12 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 29. We write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MUFL'\n\n 30. We must provide the complete data.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We take the last 24 rows of the given data (from 2017-08-08 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) and repeat them 4 times, but with the dates shifted appropriately.\n\n   How to generate dates:\n\n        The last date in the given data: 2017-08-08 23:00:00\n        Next date: 2017-08-09 00:00:00\n\n        We can generate the next 96 dates by starting from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 and adding 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n   The MUFL for the first 24 hours of the values from 2017-08-08 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n\n   Then the next 24 hours: same values again.\n\n   But note: the pattern might be the same, but the level might be changing? We are not adjusting for any trend. \n\n   However, without more data, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 31. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 32. Let's write the first few forecasted points:\n\n        date                  MUFL\n        2017-08-09 00:00:00  13.361\n        2017-08-09 01:00:00  11.869\n        2017-08-09 02:00:00  13.645\n        ... and so on.\n\n 33. We repeat the same set of 24 values for the next 4 days.\n\n 34. We note that the last day in the given data is 2017-08-08, so the next day is 2017-08-09.\n\n 35. We generate 96 rows.\n\n 36. We output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided history we don't have any. And for the forecast, we are generating without missing.\n\n But the instruction says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You must provide the complete data\". So we are providing 96 points without missing.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
