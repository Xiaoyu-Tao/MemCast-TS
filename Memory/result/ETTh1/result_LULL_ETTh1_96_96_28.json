        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 rows without any explicit mention of missingness in the given snippet.\n However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LULL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data (from 2016-10-21 to 2016-10-24).\n 2. The problem says the dataset is subdivided and may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are consecutive and without gaps.\n 3. We must forecast the next 96 hours, which would be from 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data shows a daily pattern (with variations by hour of the day), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data provided is only 4 days. This is a very short history for a seasonal model (which typically requires multiple seasons). \n But we can try to capture the daily seasonality (24 hours) and also the pattern within the day.\n\n Given the constraints, we cannot use complex models that require long history. We can try:\n   - Using the average of each hour across the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that to forecast the next 4 days?\n   - But note: the data on 2016-10-24 shows a significant positive shift in the afternoon (from negative to positive). \n     This might indicate a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (less than a week).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, the problem says we must be aware of missing values. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we assume that for forecasting we don't have missing values in the history.\n\n But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the entire dataset (which we are not given beyond the 96 points) might have missing values? \n However, we are only given 96 points and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n Since we are only given 96 points and they are complete, we can proceed.\n\n Considering the short history, we can use:\n   - A seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n  1. Extract the hour of the day and day of the week as features? But we only have 4 days (from Friday to Monday? Let's check: 2016-10-21 is a Friday, then Saturday, Sunday, Monday).\n  2. We observe that the pattern on Monday (2016-10-24) is different: it has positive values in the afternoon. The previous days are negative.\n\n How to forecast?\n  Option 1: Use the last day (Monday) as the pattern for the next days? But the next 4 days would be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? \n  However, we don't have a Tuesday in the history.\n\n  Option 2: Use the average of the same hour for the available days? But the Monday is different.\n\n  Option 3: Use a naive method: repeat the last day (2016-10-24) for the next 4 days? But the pattern might change.\n\n  Option 4: Use a linear regression with time and hour dummies? But we have only 4 days, so we can have 24 hour dummies and 4 day dummies? That would be too many parameters.\n\n  Option 5: Use a simple time series model like Holt-Winters with additive seasonality? But we have only 4 seasons (days) of data.\n\n Given the complexity and the short history, we decide to use the following:\n\n  We note that the data (LULL) on the last day (2016-10-24) is positive in the afternoon, which might be a weekly pattern (weekday vs weekend). \n  Since the next 4 days are weekdays (Tuesday to Friday), we might expect a pattern similar to Monday? But we don't have Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in the history.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays? We have:\n      Friday (2016-10-21) and Monday (2016-10-24) as weekdays, and Saturday and Sunday as weekends.\n\n  For the next 4 days (Tuesday to Friday) we can use the average of the two weekdays we have? But note that Monday is the only Monday and Friday is the only Friday.\n\n  However, we have only one week of data? Actually, we have 4 consecutive days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\n\n  We can break the data by day of week and then for each hour, we have:\n      Friday: 1 sample\n      Saturday: 1 sample\n      Sunday: 1 sample\n      Monday: 1 sample\n\n  For forecasting:\n      Tuesday: we don't have a Tuesday -> we can use Monday's pattern? or average of Friday and Monday?\n      Wednesday: same issue.\n\n  Alternatively, we can treat the data as having a daily seasonality of 24 and use a simple exponential smoothing state space model with seasonality? \n  But with 4 days, the model might not be stable.\n\n  Given the constraints, we decide to use the following heuristic:\n\n      For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average = (Friday_hour_i + Monday_hour_i) / 2   for weekdays, and then use that for the next 4 days? \n  But the next 4 days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. We have no Thursday either.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the Monday's value for Tuesday, and then use the average of Friday and Monday for Wednesday and Thursday, and then Friday again for Friday? \n  But that might be arbitrary.\n\n  Another idea: use the entire 4 days to compute an hourly average? That would smooth the differences between weekdays and weekends. \n  Then we forecast the next 4 days by repeating the 4-day pattern? But that would be 96 points? Actually, we have 4 days of history and we want 4 days of forecast.\n\n  However, the pattern on Monday is different from the weekend. So we don't want to average the weekend with weekdays.\n\n  We have:\n      Weekdays: Friday and Monday (but they are different: Friday is negative throughout, Monday has positive in the afternoon)\n      Weekend: Saturday and Sunday (both negative)\n\n  The next 4 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (all weekdays). So we should use the weekday pattern.\n\n  How to form a weekday pattern? We have two weekdays: Friday and Monday. We can average them? But they are different.\n\n  Let's look at the data:\n\n      On Friday (2016-10-21): \n          The values are negative all day, with a dip in the evening (down to -1.371 at 23:00).\n      On Monday (2016-10-24):\n          The values are negative in the morning and become positive from 12:00 onwards.\n\n  This suggests that the behavior on Monday is different from Friday. \n\n  Without more data, it is difficult to capture the weekly pattern. \n\n  Given the challenge, we decide to use the following:\n\n      For the next 4 days (Tuesday to Friday), we will use the Monday's pattern for each hour? \n      Why? Because it is the most recent weekday and the next days are weekdays. \n\n      But note: the problem says the transformer is \"Low UseLess Load\", and the Monday pattern shows a positive load in the afternoon, which might be typical for a weekday.\n\n      So we will repeat the Monday (2016-10-24) data for the next 4 days? \n\n      However, that would be 4 copies of Monday. But the next 4 days are consecutive weekdays, and we don't have information to differentiate them.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the two weekdays (Friday and Monday) for each hour? \n\n      For hour 0: (Friday_0 = -0.548, Monday_0 = -0.487) -> average = (-0.548 -0.487)/2 = -0.5175\n      For hour 1: (-0.518, -0.487) -> -0.5025\n      ... \n\n  But note: the positive values on Monday afternoon would be averaged with the negative values on Friday afternoon, which might not be appropriate.\n\n  Considering the data, we see that the Monday pattern is very different and might be more representative of a typical weekday (if Friday was an anomaly) or vice versa.\n\n  Since we don't have more context, we choose to use the Monday pattern for the next 4 days. \n\n  Why Monday? \n      - It is the most recent day and might reflect the current state.\n      - The next day is Tuesday, which is after Monday and might be similar.\n\n  Therefore, we will generate the next 96 hours by repeating the Monday (2016-10-24) data four times? \n  But wait, 24 hours * 4 = 96, so we can repeat the Monday data for the next 4 days.\n\n  However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 recorded dates. The last date in the given data is 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n  The next 96 hours would be:\n\n      2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-25 23:00:00  -> Tuesday\n      2016-10-26 00:00:00 to 2016-10-26 23:00:00  -> Wednesday\n      2016-10-27 00:00:00 to 2016-10-27 23:00:00  -> Thursday\n      2016-10-28 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00  -> Friday\n\n  We will set:\n\n      For 2016-10-25 00:00:00: same as 2016-10-24 00:00:00 -> -0.487\n      For 2016-10-25 01:00:00: same as 2016-10-24 01:00:00 -> -0.487\n      ... until 2016-10-25 23:00:00: same as 2016-10-24 23:00:00 -> 0.609\n\n      Then for 2016-10-26 00:00:00: again -0.487, and so on.\n\n  But note: the Monday data has a positive trend in the afternoon. We are repeating the same pattern for 4 days.\n\n  However, this is a simple and reasonable approach given the data.\n\n  But what if there is a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a trend.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the two weekdays for each hour? Let's try that for one hour:\n\n      Hour 12: \n          Friday: -0.761\n          Monday: 1.097\n          average: ( -0.761 + 1.097 ) / 2 = 0.168\n\n      Hour 13:\n          Friday: -0.670\n          Monday: 0.883\n          average: 0.1065\n\n      This would give a much lower positive value than Monday's.\n\n  Which one is better? We don't know.\n\n  Considering the instructions and the fact that we must provide a forecast, we decide to use the Monday pattern repeated for the next 4 days.\n\n  Why?\n      - The Monday pattern is the most recent and might be more indicative of the current operating conditions.\n\n  Therefore, we will generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24 hours of 2016-10-24 four times.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let Monday_data = the 24 values from 2016-10-24 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n      Then the forecast for:\n\n          Day1 (Tuesday): 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-25 23:00:00 -> Monday_data\n          Day2 (Wednesday): 2016-10-26 00:00:00 to 2016-10-26 23:00:00 -> Monday_data\n          Day3 (Thursday): 2016-10-27 00:00:00 to 2016-10-27 23:00:00 -> Monday_data\n          Day4 (Friday): 2016-10-28 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00 -> Monday_data\n\n  But note: the last day of the forecast (Friday) would be the same as the Monday pattern? \n  However, we don't have a Friday pattern because the Friday in the history (2016-10-21) is different.\n\n  But without more data, we stick to this.\n\n  We must generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-25 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-10-24 23:00:00)\n      Then 2016-10-25 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-10-28 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll create a list of these dates and then assign the LULL values by repeating the Monday_data four times.\n\n  The Monday_data (24 values) is:\n\n        -0.487, -0.487, -0.487, -0.518, -0.487, -0.487, -0.366, -0.183, -0.548, -0.548, -0.487, -0.518, \n        1.097, 0.883, 0.822, 0.975, 0.914, 0.853, 0.731, 0.640, 0.640, 0.579, 0.609, 0.609\n\n  We'll repeat this list 4 times.\n\n  However, note that the problem says the data will have missing values. But we are generating a forecast without missing values? \n  The problem says: \"be aware of that\" meaning in the provided data? But we are not provided with the next 96, we are to forecast.\n\n  We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, so we will not include any missing values.\n\n  Therefore, we output 96 rows of data.\n\n  Format:\n\n      <answer>\n          date                LULL\n          2016-10-25 00:00:00 -0.487\n          2016-10-25 01:00:00 -0.487\n          ... \n          (96 rows)\n\n  Let's code the dates:\n\n      from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n      start_date = datetime(2016, 10, 25, 0, 0, 0)\n      then add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n  But we are to write the data in the answer.\n\n  We'll write a list of 96 rows.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data is sampled every hour? The given data is hourly.\n\n  We'll generate:\n\n      dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n  And the LULL values: \n      monday_values = [-0.487, -0.487, -0.487, -0.518, -0.487, -0.487, -0.366, -0.183, -0.548, -0.548, -0.487, -0.518, \n                       1.097, 0.883, 0.822, 0.975, 0.914, 0.853, 0.731, 0.640, 0.640, 0.579, 0.609, 0.609]\n      forecast_values = monday_values * 4   # which repeats 4 times\n\n  But note: the Monday_data we extracted is exactly 24 values.\n\n  Let's write the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the last value of the given data is 2016-10-24 23:00:00: 0.609, and then the next point is 2016-10-25 00:00:00: -0.487 (which is the first of Monday_data). \n  This is a jump? But that's the pattern we are repeating.\n\n  We are ready to write the answer.\n\n  Important: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n  We'll write the 96 rows in the required format.\n\n  Let's do it.\n",
