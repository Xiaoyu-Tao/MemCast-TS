        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We need to handle the forecasting for the next 96 points. Since the data shows a clear daily seasonality (with peaks and troughs at similar hours) and some level of non-stationarity, we can use a time series model that captures seasonality and trends.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal ARIMA model or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. However, with only 96 points (4 days) we have limited data for seasonal modeling (daily seasonality of 24 periods).\n - Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average, but that might not capture the seasonality well.\n - Given the constraints, we are not going to build a complex model. Instead, we can use a naive seasonal method: forecast each hour by the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n However, note: the data has a pattern that repeats every 24 hours. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the available 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n But let's check the data: \n   The last timestamp is 2017-03-09 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be 4 days: 2017-03-10, 2017-03-11, 2017-03-12, 2017-03-13.\n\n Steps for the naive seasonal forecast:\n   For each hour h in [0,23]:\n        value_h = average of the HULL at hour h for the days 2017-03-06, 2017-03-07, 2017-03-08, 2017-03-09.\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend or other patterns. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture more.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more robust method by using a simple time series model with seasonality. Since we are in a constrained environment (and we cannot run code), we have to do a simple approach.\n\n Let's do the naive seasonal average:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour of the day for each record.\n   Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n But note: the data for the same hour across days might vary. We have 4 values for each hour.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n      2017-03-06 00:00:00 -> 2.478\n      2017-03-07 00:00:00 -> 1.139\n      2017-03-08 00:00:00 -> 0.938\n      2017-03-09 00:00:00 -> 0.737\n      Average = (2.478 + 1.139 + 0.938 + 0.737) / 4 = 5.292 / 4 = 1.323\n\n Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days) we repeat the same 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n However, note: the data might have a downward trend? The averages for the same hour are decreasing? But we are not adjusting for trend because we only have 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-09) as the pattern and repeat it? But that might not be better.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have to provide a forecast, we'll use the average by hour.\n\n But note: the problem says there are missing values in the data? The provided data for the past 96 points is complete. So we can compute the average.\n\n However, let me check: the data provided has exactly 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n   hour0: (2.478 + 1.139 + 0.938 + 0.737) / 4 = 1.323\n   hour1: (1.741 + 1.206 + 0.804 + 0.201) / 4 = (1.741+1.206=2.947; 2.947+0.804=3.751; 3.751+0.201=3.952) /4 = 0.988\n   hour2: (1.273 + 0.804 + 0.603 + 0.536) /4 = (1.273+0.804=2.077; 2.077+0.603=2.68; 2.68+0.536=3.216) /4 = 0.804\n   hour3: (2.746 + 1.340 + 0.670 + 0.737) /4 = (2.746+1.340=4.086; 4.086+0.670=4.756; 4.756+0.737=5.493) /4 = 1.37325\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n   Day1 (2017-03-10): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... , avg_hour23]\n   Day2 (2017-03-11): same as above\n   Day3 (2017-03-12): same\n   Day4 (2017-03-13): same\n\n But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning the next 96 hours. So we start from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 and go to 2017-03-13 23:00:00.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, we cannot model a weekly pattern. So we stick to the daily pattern.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   hour0: [2.478, 1.139, 0.938, 0.737] -> 1.323\n   hour1: [1.741, 1.206, 0.804, 0.201] -> 0.988\n   hour2: [1.273, 0.804, 0.603, 0.536] -> 0.804\n   hour3: [2.746, 1.340, 0.670, 0.737] -> 1.37325\n   hour4: [1.139, 1.005, 0.938, 1.674] -> (1.139+1.005+0.938+1.674)/4 = 4.756/4 = 1.189\n   hour5: [2.411, 0.737, 0.670, 0.737] -> (2.411+0.737+0.670+0.737)=4.555/4=1.13875\n   hour6: [1.005, 0.335, 0.134, 0.000] -> (1.005+0.335+0.134+0.000)=1.474/4=0.3685\n   hour7: [0.670, 0.536, 0.469, 0.603] -> (0.670+0.536+0.469+0.603)=2.278/4=0.5695\n   hour8: [1.608, 1.139, 1.139, 1.072] -> (1.608+1.139+1.139+1.072)=4.958/4=1.2395\n   hour9: [0.670, 0.000, 0.804, 1.273] -> (0.670+0.000+0.804+1.273)=2.747/4=0.68675\n   hour10: [0.804, 0.000, 2.009, 1.541] -> (0.804+0.000+2.009+1.541)=4.354/4=1.0885\n   hour11: [2.143, 1.206, 1.206, 1.942] -> (2.143+1.206+1.206+1.942)=6.497/4=1.62425\n   hour12: [1.340, 1.808, 1.407, 0.871] -> (1.340+1.808+1.407+0.871)=5.426/4=1.3565\n   hour13: [2.076, 2.277, 1.340, 1.340] -> (2.076+2.277+1.340+1.340)=7.033/4=1.75825\n   hour14: [1.808, 1.474, 1.340, 1.072] -> (1.808+1.474+1.340+1.072)=5.694/4=1.4235\n   hour15: [1.005, 1.273, 0.737, 0.938] -> (1.005+1.273+0.737+0.938)=3.953/4=0.98825\n   hour16: [0.000, -0.402, 0.000, 0.000] -> (0.000-0.402+0.000+0.000)= -0.402/4 = -0.1005\n   hour17: [-0.335, -0.938, -0.134, -0.469] -> (-0.335-0.938-0.134-0.469)= -1.876/4 = -0.469\n   hour18: [-1.072, -1.273, -1.340, -1.206] -> (-1.072-1.273-1.340-1.206)= -4.891/4 = -1.22275\n   hour19: [-0.871, -1.407, -1.139, -1.139] -> (-0.871-1.407-1.139-1.139)= -4.556/4 = -1.139\n   hour20: [-1.005, -1.474, -1.340, -1.005] -> (-1.005-1.474-1.340-1.005)= -4.824/4 = -1.206\n   hour21: [-0.938, -1.407, -1.139, -2.344] -> (-0.938-1.407-1.139-2.344)= -5.828/4 = -1.457\n   hour22: [-0.268, -0.469, -1.541, -1.541] -> (-0.268-0.469-1.541-1.541)= -3.819/4 = -0.95475\n   hour23: [0.670, 1.139, -0.067, 0.335] -> (0.670+1.139-0.067+0.335)= 2.077/4 = 0.51925\n\n Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n   Day1: 2017-03-10: [1.323, 0.988, 0.804, 1.37325, 1.189, 1.13875, 0.3685, 0.5695, 1.2395, 0.68675, 1.0885, 1.62425, 1.3565, 1.75825, 1.4235, 0.98825, -0.1005, -0.469, -1.22275, -1.139, -1.206, -1.457, -0.95475, 0.51925]\n   Day2: 2017-03-11: same 24 values\n   Day3: 2017-03-12: same\n   Day4: 2017-03-13: same\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing values? The instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\". So we provide the 96 values.\n\n However, we must format the dates correctly. The next date after 2017-03-09 23:00:00 is 2017-03-10 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n   Start: 2017-03-10 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 23:00:00 (24 hours for day1)\n   Then 2017-03-11 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 (day2)\n   Then 2017-03-12 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 (day3)\n   Then 2017-03-13 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 (day4)\n\n We have 96 records.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll output the 96 rows.\n\n However, note: the averages we computed are with more than 2 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places to match.\n\n Let me round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n   hour0: 1.323 -> 1.323\n   hour1: 0.988 -> 0.988\n   hour2: 0.804 -> 0.804\n   hour3: 1.37325 -> 1.373\n   hour4: 1.189 -> 1.189\n   hour5: 1.13875 -> 1.139\n   hour6: 0.3685 -> 0.368\n   but note: 0.3685 rounded to 3 decimals is 0.368? Actually, 0.3685 is 0.368 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n        Let me check: 0.3685 -> the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal: 0.369.\n        Similarly, we should round properly.\n\n   We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me recast the averages with rounding:\n\n   hour0: 1.323 -> 1.323\n   hour1: 0.988 -> 0.988\n   hour2: 0.804 -> 0.804\n   hour3: 1.37325 -> 1.373 (if we round 1.37325: look at the 4th decimal is 2, so 1.373)\n   hour4: 1.189 -> 1.189\n   hour5: 1.13875 -> 1.139 (because 0.13875: 4th decimal is 7, so round up 8 to 9 -> 0.139 -> so 1.139)\n   hour6: 0.3685 -> 0.369 (because 0.3685: 4th decimal is 5, so round up 8 to 9 -> 0.369)\n   hour7: 0.5695 -> 0.570\n   hour8: 1.2395 -> 1.240\n   hour9: 0.68675 -> 0.687\n   hour10: 1.0885 -> 1.089\n   hour11: 1.62425 -> 1.624\n   hour12: 1.3565 -> 1.357\n   hour13: 1.75825 -> 1.758\n   hour14: 1.4235 -> 1.424\n   hour15: 0.98825 -> 0.988\n   hour16: -0.1005 -> -0.101\n   hour17: -0.469 -> -0.469\n   but note: -0.469 is already 3 decimals? Actually, we computed -0.469 exactly?\n        Actually, we had -1.876/4 = -0.469 -> so -0.469\n   hour18: -1.22275 -> -1.223\n   hour19: -1.139 -> -1.139\n   but note: we computed -4.556/4 = -1.139 -> so -1.139\n   hour20: -1.206 -> -1.206\n   hour21: -1.457 -> -1.457\n   hour22: -0.95475 -> -0.955\n   hour23: 0.51925 -> 0.519\n\n But wait, let me recalculate the rounding for each:\n\n   hour0: 1.323 -> 1.323\n   hour1: 0.988 -> 0.988\n   hour2: 0.804 -> 0.804\n   hour3: 1.37325 -> 1.373 (since 0.37325: 3rd decimal is 3, 4th is 2 -> no round up)\n   hour4: 1.189 -> 1.189\n   hour5: 1.13875 -> 1.139 (because 0.13875: 3rd decimal is 8, 4th is 7 -> round up 8 to 9 -> 0.139 -> 1.139)\n   hour6: 0.3685 -> 0.369 (because 0.3685: 3rd decimal is 8, 4th is 5 -> round up 8 becomes 9 -> 0.369)\n   hour7: 0.5695 -> 0.570 (because 0.5695: 3rd decimal is 9, 4th is 5 -> round up 9 becomes 10 -> so 0.570)\n   hour8: 1.2395 -> 1.240 (0.2395: 3rd decimal is 9, 4th is 5 -> round up: 9 becomes 10 -> 0.240 -> 1.240)\n   hour9: 0.68675 -> 0.687 (0.68675: 3rd decimal is 6, 4th is 7 -> round up 6 to 7 -> 0.687)\n   hour10: 1.0885 -> 1.089 (0.0885: 3rd decimal is 8, 4th is 5 -> round up 8 to 9 -> 0.089 -> 1.089)\n   hour11: 1.62425 -> 1.624 (0.62425: 3rd decimal is 4, 4th is 2 -> no round up -> 0.624 -> 1.624)\n   hour12: 1.3565 -> 1.357 (0.3565: 3rd decimal is 6, 4th is 5 -> round up 6 to 7 -> 0.357 -> 1.357)\n   hour13: 1.75825 -> 1.758 (0.75825: 3rd decimal is 8, 4th is 2 -> no round up -> 0.758 -> 1.758)\n   hour14: 1.4235 -> 1.424 (0.4235: 3rd decimal is 3, 4th is 5 -> round up 3 to 4 -> 0.424 -> 1.424)\n   hour15: 0.98825 -> 0.988 (0.98825: 3rd decimal is 8, 4th is 2 -> no round up -> 0.988)\n   hour16: -0.1005 -> -0.101 (because: -0.1005: the absolute value 0.1005, 3rd decimal is 0, 4th is 5 -> we round up the 0 to 1? \n        Actually, rounding negative numbers: we round away from zero? \n        But in standard rounding, we round to the nearest. \n        -0.1005: the two options are -0.100 and -0.101. The distance to -0.100 is 0.0005, to -0.101 is 0.0005? \n        Actually, 0.1005 is exactly halfway? Then we round to the even? \n        But note: the rule is to round to the nearest even. \n        However, in practice, we can do: \n          -0.1005: the number is negative, but we can think in absolute: 0.1005 -> rounded to 0.101 (if we round away from zero) but the standard is to round to the nearest even for the digit. \n        Alternatively, we can compute: \n          -0.1005 * 1000 = -100.5 -> round to integer: -100 or -101? \n          The rule: round half to even: 100.5 -> 100 (even) -> so -100 -> then -0.100.\n        But wait, the rule for negative numbers:\n          The IEEE standard uses round to nearest, ties to even. \n          So -0.1005: the two candidates are -0.100 and -0.101. The tie-breaking rule: which even? \n          The even numbers are ... -0.100 and -0.102? Actually, we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n          The two candidates: -0.100 and -0.101. The even one? \n          The last digit of -0.100 is 0 (even) and of -0.101 is 1 (odd). So we choose -0.100? \n          But note: the tie-breaking rule: when the fractional part is exactly 0.5, we round to the nearest even digit. \n          So 0.1005 is not exactly 0.5 in the thousandths? Actually, 0.1005 is 100.5 in ten-thousandths? \n          We are rounding to 3 decimals: so we look at the 4th decimal. \n          The rule: if the digit to be rounded is followed by 5 and then zeros, then we round to the nearest even. \n          Here, 0.1005: the 4th decimal is 5 and then nothing? So we can consider it as exactly halfway? \n          Then we round to the even: the 3rd decimal is 0 (in 0.100) which is even, so we round to -0.100? \n          But wait, the number is negative? The rule is the same: round to the nearest even. \n          So -0.1005 -> round to -0.100? \n\n        However, let me check with positive: 0.1005 -> round to 0.100 or 0.101? \n          The rule: 0.1005 is between 0.100 and 0.101. The midpoint is 0.1005. \n          We round to the nearest even? 0.100 is even (last digit 0) and 0.101 is odd? So we choose 0.100? \n          But that would be rounding down. \n\n        Actually, the standard rule: \n          if the digit to be removed is 5 and there are no following non-zero, then round to the nearest even. \n          So 0.1005: the digit to be removed is the 5 in the 4th decimal? and we are rounding to 3 decimals. \n          The digit in the 3rd decimal is 0, and the next is 5 -> so we leave the 0 as even? so 0.100.\n\n        Therefore, -0.1005 -> -0.100.\n\n        But wait, the original computation: -0.1005 is the average? \n        Actually, we computed: (0.000 -0.402 +0.000+0.000)/4 = -0.402/4 = -0.1005.\n\n        So we round to -0.100? \n\n        However, the original data has negative values with 3 decimals. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same rounding as the original data: they have up to 3 decimals. \n\n        But note: the original data has values like -0.335, -0.402, etc. \n\n        We'll do: \n          hour16: -0.1005 -> round to -0.100? \n          But let me see: 0.1005 is closer to 0.101? \n          Actually, 0.1005 is 0.1005, which is 0.101 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n          Because 0.1005 is greater than 0.1005? \n          The rounding rule: \n            if the fractional part is >= 0.0005, then we round up? \n          For positive: 0.1005 -> round up to 0.101? \n          For negative: -0.1005 -> round down (more negative) to -0.101? \n          But that would be asymmetric. \n\n        Actually, the standard is to round half away from zero? \n          For positive: 0.1005 -> 0.101 (because 0.1005 is exactly halfway between 0.100 and 0.101? but wait, 0.1005 is 0.0005 above 0.100 and 0.0005 below 0.101? so it's exactly halfway. \n          Then the rule: round to the nearest even. \n\n        But in many contexts, we round 0.1005 to 0.101? \n\n        Let me check: \n          The rule: \n            if the digit is 5 followed by non-zero, then round up. \n            if the digit is 5 followed by zeros, then round to even. \n\n        Here, 0.1005: the digit 5 is followed by nothing? (so zeros) -> then round to even: 0.100 (because 0 is even). \n\n        So we round to 0.100 for positive? and for negative: -0.1005 -> -0.100? \n\n        However, the original data has values with 3 decimals and they might have used a different rounding? \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we'll use the standard rounding (round half to even). \n\n        Therefore:\n          hour16: -0.1005 -> -0.100\n\n        But wait, the value is negative and we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n          The number is -0.1005. The 4th decimal is 5 and the rest are 0? \n          The 3 (thousandths) is 0 -> even? so we leave it as -0.100.\n\n        However, note: the value is -0.1005, which is negative. The rounding to 3 decimals: \n          We look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> then we round the 3rd decimal (0) to the next even? which is 0? \n          we don't change it? \n\n        So -0.1005 rounded to 3 decimals is -0.100.\n\n        But that seems counterintuitive? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the method: \n          round(-0.1005, 3) in Python: \n            >>> round(-0.1005, 3)\n            -0.1   -> which is -0.100? \n\n        But let me check: \n          >>> round(0.1005, 3) \n          Actually, in Python: \n            >>> round(0.1005, 3)\n            0.1\n            >>> round(-0.1005, 3)\n            -0.1\n\n        So it becomes -0.100? \n\n        However, note: the original data has negative values with 3 decimals: e.g., -0.335, -0.402, etc. \n\n        We'll do: \n          hour16: -0.1005 -> -0.100\n\n        But wait, the original data has values like -0.335, which is -0.335. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same precision: 3 decimals. \n\n        We'll do the rounding as per standard: round half to even. \n\n        So:\n          hour16: -0.1005 -> -0.100\n\n        But note: the average we computed for hour16 is -0.1005, and we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n          -0.1005 is -0.1005, which is between -0.100 and -0.101. \n          distance to -0.100: 0.0005\n          distance to -0.101: 0.0005\n          and we choose the even one: -0.100 (because 0 is even) and -0.101 ends with 1 (odd). \n\n        So we choose -0.100.\n\n   hour17: -0.469 -> -0.469 (exactly, so no rounding needed)\n   hour18: -1.22275 -> \n        Rounding: -1.22275: \n          The 4th decimal is 7 -> which is greater than 5? so we round up? \n          But for negative: rounding up means making it less negative? \n          Actually, we round the absolute value: 1.22275 -> round to 1.223? then make it -1.223.\n        Because 1.22275: \n          3rd decimal is 2, 4th is 7 -> so we round up the 2 to 3 -> 1.223 -> so -1.223.\n\n   hour19: -1.139 -> -1.139\n   hour20: -1.206 -> -1.206\n   hour21: -1.457 -> -1.457\n   hour22: -0.95475 -> \n        Absolute: 0.95475 -> 4th decimal is 5, and then nothing? \n        So we round to the nearest even: \n          0.95475: the 3rd decimal is 4, 4th is 7 -> so we round up 4 to 5? -> 0.955 -> so -0.955.\n        But wait, 0.95475: the 4th decimal is 7, which is >5, so we round up the 4 to 5 -> 0.955.\n        So -0.955.\n\n   hour23: 0.51925 -> \n        0.51925: 4th decimal is 2 -> so we leave as 0.519.\n\n   But wait, 0.51925: \n        The 3rd decimal is 9, 4th is 2 -> so we leave 9 -> 0.519.\n\n   However, let me check: \n        hour23: 0.51925 -> 0.519 (because 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5)\n\n   So we have:\n\n   hour0: 1.323\n   hour1: 0.988\n   hour2: 0.804\n   hour3: 1.373\n   hour4: 1.189\n   hour5: 1.139\n   hour6: 0.369\n   hour7: 0.570\n   hour8: 1.240\n   hour9: 0.687\n   hour10: 1.089\n   hour11: 1.624\n   hour12: 1.357\n   hour13: 1.758\n   hour14: 1.424\n   hour15: 0.988\n   hour16: -0.100\n   hour17: -0.469\n   hour18: -1.223\n   hour19: -1.139\n   hour20: -1.206\n   hour21: -1.457\n   hour22: -0.955\n   hour23: 0.519\n\n Now, we create the 96 records:\n\n   Day1: 2017-03-10 00:00:00 -> 1.323\n          2017-03-10 01:00:00 -> 0.988\n          ... until 2017-03-10 23:00:00 -> 0.519\n\n   Day2: 2017-03-11 00:00:00 -> 1.323\n          ... same pattern\n\n   Day3: same\n   Day4: same\n\n We write the data in the format:\n\n        date                HULL\n        2017-03-10 00:00:00 1.323\n        2017-03-10 01:00:00 0.988\n        ... \n\n We must output 96 rows.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
