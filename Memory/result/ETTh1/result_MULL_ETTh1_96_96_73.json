        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, in the provided segment, there are no missing values.\n\n 2. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we need a model that can handle multiple steps. Given the complexity and the need for accuracy, we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing that can capture seasonality and trends.\n\n 3. Observing the data: \n    - The data seems to have a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, we see negative values during the day and positive or less negative at night.\n    - There might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days of data, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we will focus on daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 4. We are to forecast 96 hours (4 days) ahead.\n\n 5. We must handle any missing values in the input? But the provided 96 points are complete. However, if we were to build a robust model, we would impute missing values. Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", but in this case we don't have any, we proceed.\n\n 6. We choose a model: SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because of the evident seasonality.\n\n 7. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We have hourly data with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n    - We need to set the parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24).\n\n 8. We can use auto_arima from pmdarima to find the best parameters? But since we cannot run code, we have to rely on experience.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model if we are to write the forecast without code. However, the problem requires a forecast.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by:\n     - Using the last 4 days to compute a daily profile (average pattern over 24 hours) and then replicate that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 11. But note: the data does not look exactly the same every day. There is variation.\n\n 12. Another idea: use a naive seasonal forecast: the value at the same hour of the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days.\n\n 13. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     We have 4 days: 2017-04-19, 2017-04-20, 2017-04-21, 2017-04-22.\n\n     For each hour (0 to 23), we average the MULL values at that hour across the 4 days.\n\n 14. However, note that the last day (2017-04-22) ends at 23:00, and we want to start forecasting from 2017-04-23 00:00:00.\n\n 15. We can compute:\n\n     hour0_avg = (value at 00:00 on 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd) / 4\n     ... and so on.\n\n 16. Then the forecast for 2017-04-23 00:00:00 would be hour0_avg, 01:00:00 would be hour1_avg, etc.\n\n 17. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. We are not missing values in the provided 96, but if we were to do this in the presence of missing values, we would have to impute. However, we are not missing any in the provided data.\n\n 18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have:\n\n     Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        2017-04-19: 0.071\n        2017-04-20: 0.355\n        2017-04-21: 0.036\n        2017-04-22: -0.995\n        average = (0.071 + 0.355 + 0.036 - 0.995) / 4 = (-0.533) / 4 = -0.13325\n\n     Similarly, we do for every hour.\n\n 19. However, note that the pattern might not be stable and we are only using 4 days. But it's a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-04-22) as the pattern for the next day? But that might not capture the average.\n\n 21. Considering the data, we see that the values on 2017-04-22 are different from the previous days. For example, at 00:00:00 on 2017-04-22 we have -0.995, which is much lower than the previous days.\n\n 22. Another approach: use the median for each hour to avoid the effect of outliers? But we have only 4 points.\n\n 23. Given the time, we will compute the average for each hour and use that for the next 4 days.\n\n 24. Steps:\n\n     - We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n     - Then we replicate that pattern for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 25. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to see a long-term trend. We are only using 4 days. So we ignore trend.\n\n 26. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00): [0.071, 0.355, 0.036, -0.995] -> (-0.533)/4 = -0.13325\n     Hour 1 (01:00): [0.000, 0.391, 0.107, -0.391] -> (0.000+0.391+0.107-0.391)=0.107 -> 0.02675\n     Hour 2 (02:00): [-0.036, 1.670, 0.178, -1.066] -> (-0.036+1.670+0.178-1.066)=0.746 -> 0.1865\n     Hour 3 (03:00): [-0.995, 1.102, 0.426, -0.853] -> (-0.995+1.102+0.426-0.853)= -0.32 -> -0.08\n     ... and so on.\n\n 27. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 29. However, note that the problem might require a more sophisticated method. But without the ability to run code and given the time, we use this simple average.\n\n 30. We must output the complete data for the next 96 hours in the same format.\n\n 31. Format:\n\n        date and time (from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00) and the forecasted MULL.\n\n 32. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-23 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2017-04-26 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 = 96 hours).\n\n 33. We'll compute the 24 hourly averages and then assign:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-04-23): hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg\n        Day 2 (2017-04-24): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (2017-04-25): same\n        Day 4 (2017-04-26): same\n\n 34. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to capture weekly. So we stick to daily.\n\n 35. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll list the 4 values for each hour and compute the mean.\n\n     Hour 0: [0.071, 0.355, 0.036, -0.995] -> mean = (0.071+0.355+0.036-0.995)/4 = (-0.533)/4 = -0.13325\n     Hour 1: [0.000, 0.391, 0.107, -0.391] -> (0.000+0.391+0.107-0.391) = 0.107 -> 0.107/4 = 0.02675\n     Hour 2: [-0.036, 1.670, 0.178, -1.066] -> (-0.036+1.670+0.178-1.066) = 0.746 -> 0.746/4 = 0.1865\n     Hour 3: [-0.995, 1.102, 0.426, -0.853] -> (-0.995+1.102+0.426-0.853) = -0.32 -> -0.32/4 = -0.08\n     Hour 4: [0.249, 1.528, 0.320, -1.421] -> (0.249+1.528+0.320-1.421) = 0.676 -> 0.676/4 = 0.169\n     Hour 5: [-0.213, 1.812, 0.142, -1.066] -> (-0.213+1.812+0.142-1.066) = 0.675 -> 0.675/4 = 0.16875\n     Hour 6: [-0.320, -0.213, 0.000, -1.599] -> (-0.320-0.213+0.000-1.599) = -2.132 -> -2.132/4 = -0.533\n     Hour 7: [-0.640, 0.249, 0.284, -0.995] -> (-0.640+0.249+0.284-0.995) = -1.102 -> -1.102/4 = -0.2755\n     Hour 8: [-0.675, -0.853, -0.178, -1.564] -> (-0.675-0.853-0.178-1.564) = -3.27 -> -3.27/4 = -0.8175\n     Hour 9: [-1.279, -1.350, -1.315, -0.782] -> (-1.279-1.350-1.315-0.782) = -4.726 -> -4.726/4 = -1.1815\n     Hour 10: [-1.173, -1.066, -0.640, -0.924] -> (-1.173-1.066-0.640-0.924) = -3.803 -> -3.803/4 = -0.95075\n     Hour 11: [-1.386, -0.853, -0.355, -0.746] -> (-1.386-0.853-0.355-0.746) = -3.34 -> -3.34/4 = -0.835\n     Hour 12: [-1.706, -1.315, -1.812, -2.097] -> (-1.706-1.315-1.812-2.097) = -6.93 -> -6.93/4 = -1.7325\n     Hour 13: [-1.208, -0.284, -1.244, -0.320] -> (-1.208-0.284-1.244-0.320) = -3.056 -> -3.056/4 = -0.764\n     Hour 14: [-1.279, -1.279, -1.564, -1.386] -> (-1.279-1.279-1.564-1.386) = -5.508 -> -5.508/4 = -1.377\n     Hour 15: [-1.706, -1.670, -1.386, -0.675] -> (-1.706-1.670-1.386-0.675) = -5.437 -> -5.437/4 = -1.35925\n     Hour 16: [-1.244, -1.421, -1.421, -0.995] -> (-1.244-1.421-1.421-0.995) = -5.081 -> -5.081/4 = -1.27025\n     Hour 17: [-1.564, -1.208, -1.706, -1.919] -> (-1.564-1.208-1.706-1.919) = -6.397 -> -6.397/4 = -1.59925\n     Hour 18: [-1.990, -1.564, -2.061, -1.883] -> (-1.990-1.564-2.061-1.883) = -7.498 -> -7.498/4 = -1.8745\n     Hour 19: [-1.777, -1.492, -1.954, -1.954] -> (-1.777-1.492-1.954-1.954) = -7.177 -> -7.177/4 = -1.79425\n     Hour 20: [-1.990, -1.883, -2.025, -1.954] -> (-1.990-1.883-2.025-1.954) = -7.852 -> -7.852/4 = -1.963\n     Hour 21: [-3.056, -1.528, -2.345, -1.244] -> (-3.056-1.528-2.345-1.244) = -8.173 -> -8.173/4 = -2.04325\n     Hour 22: [-1.919, -1.279, -1.990, -0.569] -> (-1.919-1.279-1.990-0.569) = -5.757 -> -5.757/4 = -1.43925\n     Hour 23: [0.142, 0.497, -1.386, 0.000] -> (0.142+0.497-1.386+0.000) = -0.747 -> -0.747/4 = -0.18675\n\n 36. Now, we round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n     Hour 0: -0.13325 -> -0.133\n     Hour 1: 0.02675 -> 0.027\n     Hour 2: 0.1865 -> 0.187\n     Hour 3: -0.08 -> -0.080\n     We'll do the same for all.\n\n 37. But note: the average might not be the best because of the small sample and the last day being different. However, we proceed.\n\n 38. We'll create the forecast:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-04-23 00:00:00 -> hour0: -0.133\n            2017-04-23 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.027\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> hour23: -0.187\n\n     Then repeat for 2017-04-24, 2017-04-25, 2017-04-26.\n\n 39.

(1.8745: third decimal is 4, fourth is 5 -> round up 4 to 5 -> 1.875 -> -1.875)\n        hour19: -1.79425 -> -1.794 (1.79425: third decimal is 4, fourth is 2 -> leave 4 -> -1.794)\n        hour20: -1.963 -> -1.963 (we had -1.963 exactly? -7.852/4 = -1.963 -> so -1.963)\n        hour21: -2.04325 -> -2.043 (1.04325: third decimal is 3, fourth is 2 -> leave 3 -> -2.043)\n        hour22: -1.43925 -> -1.439 (1.43925: third decimal is 9, fourth is 2 -> leave 9 -> -1.439)\n        hour23: -0.18675 -> -0.187 (0.18675: third decimal is 6, fourth is 7 -> round up 6 to 7 -> 0.187 -> -0.187)\n\n 47. Now, we list the 24 values for one day:\n\n        hour0: -0.133\n        hour1: 0.027\n        hour2: 0.187\n        hour3: -0.080\n        hour4: 0.169\n        hour5: 0.169\n        hour6: -0.533\n        hour7: -0.276\n        hour8: -0.818\n        hour9: -1.182\n        hour10: -0.951\n        hour11: -0.835\n        hour12: -1.733\n        hour13: -0.764\n        hour14: -1.377\n        hour15: -1.359\n        hour16: -1.270\n        hour17: -1.599\n        hour18: -1.875\n        hour19: -1.794\n        hour20: -1.963\n        hour21: -2.043\n        hour22: -1.439\n        hour23: -0.187\n\n 48. Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n 49. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-23 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-04-26 23:00:00\n\n 50. We write the data in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <value>\"\n\n 51. We output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 52. We put inside the <answer> tag as specified.\n\n 53. Note: the original data had negative zeros? We have negative values, so we output negative.\n\n 54. Let's write the first day:\n\n        2017-04-23 00:00:00 -0.133\n        2017-04-23 01:00:00 0.027\n        2017-04-23 02:00:00 0.187\n        2017-04-23 03:00:00 -0.080\n        2017-04-23 04:00:00 0.169\n        2017-04-23 05:00:00 0.169\n        2017-04-23 06:00:00 -0.533\n        2017-04-23 07:00:00 -0.276\n        2017-04-23 08:00:00 -0.818\n        2017-04-23 09:00:00 -1.182\n        2017-04-23 10:00:00 -0.951\n        2017-04-23 11:00:00 -0.835\n        2017-04-23 12:00:00 -1.733\n        2017-04-23 13:00:00 -0.764\n        2017-04-23 14:00:00 -1.377\n        2017-04-23 15:00:00 -1.359\n        2017-04-23 16:00:00 -1.270\n        2017-04-23 17:00:00 -1.599\n        2017-04-23 18:00:00 -1.875\n        2017-04-23 19:00:00 -1.794\n        2017-04-23 20:00:00 -1.963\n        2017-04-23 21:00:00 -2.043\n        2017-04-23 22:00:00 -1.439\n        2017-04-23 23:00:00 -0.187\n\n 55. Then the next day (2017-04-24) same values:\n\n        2017-04-24 00:00:00 -0.133\n        2017-04-24 01:00:00 0.027\n        ... and so on.\n\n 56. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 57. We output the entire block.\n\n 58. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 59. We write the answer accordingly.\n",
