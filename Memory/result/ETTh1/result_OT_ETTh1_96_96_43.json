        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The user says the data will have missing values, but in the provided data, we don't see any explicit missing values (like NaN). \n    However, we must be cautious. The provided data seems complete for the given 96 points.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00).\n\n 4. Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use an appropriate model. Given the hourly data and the relatively short history (only 4 days), \n    we might consider models that capture:\n    - Seasonality: There appears to be daily seasonality (24 hours).\n    - Trend: The data does not a clear long-term trend in just 4 days, but we can capture local patterns.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting with seasonality: \n    - We can use a seasonal naive method, but that might not capture the patterns well.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data has some irregularities (like the drop on 2016-12-20 21:00:00 to 5.698 and then a rise). \n    We must be cautious of such events.\n\n 7. Since we are only given 4 days, it's challenging to build a robust model. We might consider using the average of the same hour in the past days, \n    but adjusted for any trend or recent changes.\n\n 8. Another approach: use an autoregressive model with lags at 24 hours (daily seasonality). But with only 4 days, we have only 4 points per hour.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete answer without missing values, we will use a simple method:\n\n    We calculate the average of each hour over the 4 available days and then adjust by the last day's deviation from the average.\n\n    Steps for the simple method:\n      a) Create a matrix of 4 days (rows) and 24 hours (columns).\n      b) For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n      c) We note that the last day (2016-12-23) might be the most relevant. So we can compute the difference between the last day and the average of the first 3 days for each hour?\n      d) Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days and then add a drift based on the overall trend of the last day.\n\n    However, we see that the data does not have a clear trend and has some volatility.\n\n 10. Considering the above, we can use the following:\n\n      Forecast for hour h on day 5 (2016-12-24) = (average of hour h over the 4 days) * (a smoothing factor) + (1 - smoothing factor) * (value of hour h on day 4)\n\n     But we don't have a strong reason to weight the last day more. Alternatively, we can use the average without weighting.\n\n 11. But note: the data on 2016-12-23 shows a general increase in temperature? Let's check:\n\n      The last day (2016-12-23) has values that are generally higher than the previous days? \n        For example, at 00:00: \n          2016-12-20: 8.020\n          2016-12-21: 8.723\n          2016-12-22: 8.160\n          2016-12-23: 12.029 -> much higher.\n\n      This suggests that there might be a rising trend? But then it drops at the end of the day.\n\n 12. Given the volatility and the short history, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the next day, and then for the subsequent days, \n     we can use the average pattern but adjust by the overall level of the previous day? \n\n     However, the problem requires 96 points (4 days). We can do:\n\n        Day 5 (2016-12-24): for each hour h, use the average of the same hour from the 4 days (Dec 20 to 23).\n        Day 6 (2016-12-25): same as Day 5? But that would be the same pattern. Alternatively, we can use the same pattern as the average but adjust by the difference between Day5 and the average of the first 4 days? \n\n     This might be too simplistic.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the last 4 days to predict the next day. So for each day in the forecast, we use the average of the same hour over the last 4 observed days. \n     for the first forecast day (2016-12-24), we use the average of the same hour from Dec 20,21,22,23.\n     for the next day (2016-12-25), we would use the average of the same hour from Dec 21,22,23 and the forecasted day (2016-12-24) for that hour? \n        But we don't have the actual for Dec 24, so we use the forecasted value? This might lead to a recursive average that smooths out.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only required to provide a forecast (and the data is limited), we are going to use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n     That is, for each hour (0 to 23) in the day, we compute:\n\n        avg_h = (value at hour h on day1 + day2 + day3 + day4) / 4\n\n     Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the same 24-hour pattern (the 24 averages) for 4 times.\n\n 15. Why this approach?\n     - It captures the daily seasonality.\n     - It smooths out the noise by averaging over 4 days.\n\n 16. But note: the data on 2016-12-23 is quite different. However, without more data, we cannot know if that is a new pattern or an anomaly.\n\n 17. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We'll group by the hour of the day (0 to 23) and average.\n\n     Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Dec 20: 8.020\n        Dec 21: 8.723\n        Dec 22: 8.160\n        Dec 23: 12.029\n        Average = (8.020+8.723+8.160+12.029)/4 = 9.233\n\n     Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Dec 20: 6.964\n        Dec 21: 8.723\n        Dec 22: 6.402\n        Dec 23: 12.240\n        Average = (6.964+8.723+6.402+12.240)/4 = 8.58225\n\n     And so on.\n\n 18. Then the forecast for:\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00: 9.233\n        2016-12-24 01:00:00: 8.58225\n        ... until 2016-12-24 23:00:00: (average for hour 23)\n\n     Then for 2016-12-25, we use the same set of averages: \n        2016-12-25 00:00:00: 9.233\n        2016-12-25 01:00:00: 8.58225\n        ... and so on.\n\n 19. We do this for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 20. However, note that the last day (2016-12-23) has a very high value at hour 0 (12.029) which pulls the average up. \n     This might be acceptable if we believe that the pattern is changing, but we have no evidence. Alternatively, we could use the median to avoid the effect of outliers? \n     But the problem does not specify.\n\n 21. Since the problem says there are missing values in the data (though we don't see any in the provided 96 points) and we are to be aware, we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 22. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 23. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (8.020 + 8.723 + 8.160 + 12.029) / 4 = 9.233\n     Hour 1: (6.964 + 8.723 + 6.402 + 12.240) / 4 = 8.58225 -> 8.582\n     Hour 2: (6.683 + 7.246 + 6.472 + 11.537) / 4 = 7.9845 -> 7.985\n     Hour 3: (5.698 + 9.497 + 7.386 + 11.678) / 4 = 8.56475 -> 8.565\n     Hour 4: (7.457 + 10.060 + 7.246 + 12.100) / 4 = 9.21575 -> 9.216\n     Hour 5: (5.839 + 10.200 + 7.386 + 11.748) / 4 = 8.79325 -> 8.793\n     Hour 6: (9.919 + 10.622 + 6.542 + 11.185) / 4 = 9.567\n     Hour 7: (8.090 + 9.075 + 7.105 + 12.240) / 4 = 9.1275 -> 9.128\n     Hour 8: (7.879 + 9.919 + 7.949 + 12.381) / 4 = 9.532\n     Hour 9: (9.145 + 9.004 + 7.457 + 12.170) / 4 = 9.444\n     Hour 10: (9.638 + 6.472 + 7.597 + 12.029) / 4 = 8.934\n     Hour 11: (9.286 + 7.105 + 8.301 + 12.944) / 4 = 9.409\n     Hour 12: (9.919 + 5.557 + 9.004 + 10.000) -> Wait, the 12th hour on Dec 23 is 10.693? \n          Correction: \n          Dec 20 12:00: 9.919\n          Dec 21 12:00: 5.557\n          Dec 22 12:00: 9.004\n          Dec 23 12:00: 10.693? But the data for Dec 23 at 12:00 is actually 10.693? \n          Let me check the data: \n              2016-12-23 12:00:00  10.693? \n          Actually, the data for Dec 23 at 12:00: \n              \"2016-12-23 12:00:00 10.693\" -> but in the data above, it's written as 10.693? \n          However, in the provided data for Dec 23, at 12:00:00, it is 10.693? \n          But wait, the data for Dec 23 at 12:00:00 is actually: \n              \"2016-12-23 12:00:00 10.693\" -> but in the list above, it's written as 10.693? \n          Actually, the data for Dec 23 12:00:00 is given as 10.693? \n          But in the data above, I see: \n              2016-12-23 12:00:00 10.693 -> yes.\n\n          So: (9.919 + 5.557 + 9.004 + 10.693) / 4 = 8.79325 -> 8.793\n\n     Hour 13: (9.919 + 5.768 + 9.215 + 10.833) / 4 = 8.93375 -> 8.934\n     Hour 14: (9.708 + 8.582 + 10.693 + 12.240) / 4 = 10.30575 -> 10.306\n     Hour 15: (9.567 + 7.316 + 9.849 + 11.467) / 4 = 9.54975 -> 9.550\n     Hour 16: (9.215 + 8.090 + 10.200 + 11.818) / 4 = 9.83075 -> 9.831\n     Hour 17: (8.864 + 10.130 + 9.286 + 11.115) / 4 = 9.84875 -> 9.849\n     Hour 18: (8.934 + 9.638 + 11.044 + 10.552) / 4 = 10.042\n     Hour 19: (9.215 + 8.090 + 10.974 + 9.286) / 4 = 9.39125 -> 9.391\n     Hour 20: (9.286 + 9.145 + 11.115 + 8.442) / 4 = 9.497\n     Hour 21: (5.698 + 8.020 + 10.974 + 8.231) / 4 = 8.23075 -> 8.231\n     Hour 22: (7.949 + 8.582 + 11.396 + 8.582) / 4 = 9.12725 -> 9.127\n     Hour 23: (8.723 + 8.231 + 11.396 + 6.964) / 4 = 8.8285 -> 8.829\n\n 24. Now, we have 24 average values for the 0-23 hours. We will use these as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days.\n\n 25. The next 96 hours (4 days) start from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n 26. We generate:\n\n      Day 1: 2016-12-24 \n          00:00:00 -> 9.233\n          01:00:00 -> 8.582\n          02:00:00 -> 7.985\n          ... until 23:00:00 -> 8.829\n\n      Day 2: 2016-12-25: same 24 values\n      Day 3: 2016-12-26: same\n      Day 4: 2016-12-27: same\n\n 27. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 28. However, note: the user said the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. \n     We are forecasting without missing values? The forecast will be complete.\n\n 29. We output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 30. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 31. Let's write the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-12-24 00:00:00\n      Then 2016-12-24 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We'll generate the dates and then assign the corresponding average value for the hour.\n\n 33. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 34. The computed averages (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n      Hour0: 9.233\n      Hour1: 8.582\n      Hour2: 7.985\n      Hour3: 8.565\n      Hour4: 9.216\n      Hour5: 8.793\n      Hour6: 9.567\n      Hour7: 9.128\n      Hour8: 9.532\n      Hour9: 9.444\n      Hour10: 8.934\n      Hour11: 9.409\n      Hour12: 8.793\n      (Note: we computed 8.793 for hour12, but let me double-check: \n          (9.919 + 5.557 + 9.004 + 10.693) = 35.173 -> 35.173/4 = 8.79325 -> 8.793)\n      Hour13: 8.934\n      Hour14: 10.306\n      Hour15: 9.550\n      Hour16: 9.831\n      Hour17: 9.849\n      Hour18: 10.042\n      Hour19: 9.391\n      Hour20: 9.497\n      Hour21: 8.231\n      Hour22: 9.127\n      Hour23: 8.829\n\n 35. Now, we write the forecast.\n\n 36.

Now, we write the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-12-24 -> hours 0 to 23: use the list in order.\n        Day 2: 2016-12-25 -> same list\n        Day 3: 2016-12-26 -> same\n        Day 4: 2016-12-27 -> same\n\n 61. We generate:\n\n        for day in range(4):   # 0 to 3\n            for hour_idx in range(24):\n                date_str = (datetime(2016, 12, 24) + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour_idx)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                value = hourly_avg[hour_idx]\n                print(f\"{date_str}  {value:.3f} }\")   # but we must format to 3 decimals\n\n 62. But note: the first day (2016-12-24) we start at 00:00:00 and then 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00.\n     Then 2016-12-25 00:00:00, etc.\n\n 63. We'll do it step by step.\n\n 64. We output the data.\n\n 65. We note that the value for hour21 is 8.231, which is the same as the last day's hour23? But that's the computed average.\n\n 66. We are ready.\n\n 67. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are not given any in the input. \n     We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 68. We output the complete 96 points.\n\n 69. Let's write the answer.\n",
