        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points ahead, \n    we can consider methods like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple moving average. However, the data shows some daily patterns.\n\n Observation of the data:\n   - The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours in a day).\n   - We can try using a seasonal model. Since we have hourly data, the seasonal period is 24.\n\n 4. We choose to use Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. We will try to find the best parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24) by using grid search or \n    using auto_arima from pmdarima (if we were coding). But since we are not, we will make an educated guess.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) because the data has clear seasonality.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days, which is very short for training a seasonal model with 24 periods. We might not have enough seasons.\n\n 6. Given the challenge, we might use a naive method: using the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the last day (24 hours) as the forecast? But that would be too naive and ignore the trend.\n\n 8. We can try to decompose the time series and then forecast the components. But again, with only 4 days, it's difficult.\n\n 9. Considering the constraints, we will use a simple average of the same hour from the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    For example:\n        Forecast for 2016-12-24 00:00:00 = average of the values at 00:00:00 on 2016-12-20, 2016-12-21, 2016-12-22, 2016-12-23.\n        Similarly for 01:00:00, etc.\n\n    Then for the next day (2016-12-25) we use the same set of averages? But that would be the same as the first day.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form a daily profile and then repeat that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        2016-12-20: values mostly between 6 and 13\n        2016-12-21: between 5.6 and 12.5\n        2016-12-22: between 5 and 12\n        2016-12-23: between 6.9 and 14.5\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n 10. Therefore, we will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps:\n        - Group the data by hour (i.e., 0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n        - For the next 4 days (2016-12-24 to 2016-12-27), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 11. But note: the last day (2016-12-23) has a higher value at 23:00 (13.798) which might be an outlier? However, we are taking 4 days average so it will be smoothed.\n\n 12. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (13.329 + 10.181 + 7.100 + 12.056) / 4 = (13.329+10.181=23.51; 23.51+7.100=30.61; 30.61+12.056=42.666) -> 42.666/4 = 10.6665\n        hour1: (13.329 + 10.248 + 7.569 + 12.860) / 4 = (13.329+10.248=23.577; 23.577+7.569=31.146; 31.146+12.860=44.006) -> 11.0015\n        ... and so on.\n\n 13. We will compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then for the next 96 hours (4 days) we assign:\n\n        Day1 (2016-12-24): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day2 (2016-12-25): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day3 (2016-12-26): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day4 (2016-12-27): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n 14. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 15. However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n     So we can proceed.\n\n 16. We must generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-12-24 00:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n     We'll compute the hourly averages for the 24 hours.\n\n     Steps for computation:\n\n        hour0: average of the 4 values at 00:00:00 of the 4 days.\n        hour1: average of the 4 values at 01:00:00 of the 4 days.\n        ...\n        hour23: average of the 4 values at 23:00:00 of the 4 days.\n\n 17. Then we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-24 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-12-27 23:00:00\n\n        We'll have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n 18. Format: We must output in the same structure as the input, with two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL'.\n\n 19. We must output the data in the required XML-like tags.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (13.329, 10.181, 7.100, 12.056) -> (13.329+10.181+7.100+12.056)/4 = 42.666/4 = 10.6665\n    Hour 1: (13.329, 10.248, 7.569, 12.860) -> (13.329+10.248+7.569+12.860) = 44.006/4 = 11.0015\n    Hour 2: (11.855, 9.980, 5.693, 11.320) -> (11.855+9.980+5.693+11.320) = 38.848/4 = 9.712\n    Hour 3: (11.052, 9.980, 7.033, 12.927) -> (11.052+9.980+7.033+12.927) = 40.992/4 = 10.248\n    Hour 4: (11.989, 10.583, 5.090, 12.190) -> (11.989+10.583+5.090+12.190) = 39.852/4 = 9.963\n    Hour 5: (10.717, 12.525, 7.837, 11.588) -> (10.717+12.525+7.837+11.588) = 42.667/4 = 10.66675\n    Hour 6: (10.717, 12.056, 7.368, 12.525) -> (10.717+12.056+7.368+12.525) = 42.666/4 = 10.6665\n    Hour 7: (10.114, 11.387, 8.707, 14.535) -> (10.114+11.387+8.707+14.535) = 44.743/4 = 11.18575\n    Hour 8: (8.439, 7.770, 8.105, 13.329) -> (8.439+7.770+8.105+13.329) = 37.643/4 = 9.41075\n    Hour 9: (7.301, 7.569, 8.506, 9.377) -> (7.301+7.569+8.506+9.377) = 32.753/4 = 8.18825\n    Hour 10: (8.774, 8.975, 9.444, 9.712) -> (8.774+8.975+9.444+9.712) = 36.905/4 = 9.22625\n    Hour 11: (9.712, 9.511, 10.315, 10.181) -> (9.712+9.511+10.315+10.181) = 39.719/4 = 9.92975\n    Hour 12: (6.698, 7.435, 8.172, 6.966) -> (6.698+7.435+8.172+6.966) = 29.271/4 = 7.31775\n    Hour 13: (7.770, 7.636, 8.439, 8.573) -> (7.770+7.636+8.439+8.573) = 32.418/4 = 8.1045\n    Hour 14: (7.703, 6.966, 8.975, 8.774) -> (7.703+6.966+8.975+8.774) = 32.418/4 = 8.1045\n    Hour 15: (6.966, 7.368, 7.703, 7.703) -> (6.966+7.368+7.703+7.703) = 29.74/4 = 7.435\n    Hour 16: (8.172, 8.506, 7.569, 7.569) -> (8.172+8.506+7.569+7.569) = 31.816/4 = 7.954\n    Hour 17: (9.377, 9.042, 9.109, 9.176) -> (9.377+9.042+9.109+9.176) = 36.704/4 = 9.176\n    Hour 18: (8.506, 8.640, 9.042, 8.640) -> (8.506+8.640+9.042+8.640) = 34.828/4 = 8.707\n    Hour 19: (8.239, 8.439, 9.243, 8.908) -> (8.239+8.439+9.243+8.908) = 34.829/4 = 8.70725\n    Hour 20: (7.904, 7.435, 8.908, 8.707) -> (7.904+7.435+8.908+8.707) = 32.954/4 = 8.2385\n    Hour 21: (6.765, 6.430, 7.368, 9.310) -> (6.765+6.430+7.368+9.310) = 29.873/4 = 7.46825\n    Hour 22: (8.707, 6.095, 10.516, 11.119) -> (8.707+6.095+10.516+11.119) = 36.437/4 = 9.10925\n    Hour 23: (8.506, 5.693, 11.922, 13.798) -> (8.506+5.693+11.922+13.798) = 39.919/4 = 9.97975\n\n 20. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-12-24\n           00:00:00 -> 10.6665\n           01:00:00 -> 11.0015\n           02:00:00 -> 9.712\n           03:00:00 -> 10.248\n           04:00:00 -> 9.963\n           05:00:00 -> 10.66675\n           06:00:00 -> 10.6665\n           07:00:00 -> 11.18575\n           08:00:00 -> 9.41075\n           09:00:00 -> 8.18825\n           10:00:00 -> 9.22625\n           11:00:00 -> 9.92975\n           12:00:00 -> 7.31775\n           13:00:00 -> 8.1045\n           14:00:00 -> 8.1045\n           15:00:00 -> 7.435\n           16:00:00 -> 7.954\n           17:00:00 -> 9.176\n           18:00:00 -> 8.707\n           19:00:00 -> 8.70725\n           20:00:00 -> 8.2385\n           21:00:00 -> 7.46825\n           22:00:00 -> 9.10925\n           23:00:00 -> 9.97975\n\n        Day 2: 2016-12-25: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2016-12-26: same 24 values\n        Day 4: 2016-12-27: same 24 values\n\n 21. We must format the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 22. However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimals.\n\n 23. Let's round the averages:\n\n        Hour0: 10.6665 -> 10.667\n        Hour1: 11.0015 -> 11.002\n        But note: the input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the exact average and then format to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll compute the average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 24. We recalc with rounding:\n\n        We'll compute each average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Hour0: round(10.6665, 3) -> 10.667\n        But note: the input data had at most 3 decimals, so we output 3 decimals.\n\n 25. However, the problem does not specify the precision, but the example has 3. So we output 3.\n\n 26. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 27. We must output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00 10.667\n        2016-12-24 01:00:00 11.002\n        ... and so on.\n\n 28. But note: the input had the date and then the value in a tabular form. We'll output:\n\n        date                 HUFL\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00 10.667\n        ...\n\n 29. However, the output format in the example was:\n\n               date   HUFL\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00 13.329\n\n    We'll output without the header? The problem says \"complete data\", meaning the next 96 records.\n\n    The example output format in the problem was without the header? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n    And the example input had a header and then the data. But the problem says \"the complete data\" and then the example input was given with the header.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\"\n\n    And the example input they provided included the header? But in the answer, we are only to provide the data rows? \n\n    Since the problem says \"the complete data\", and the example input had the header, but the problem does not specify whether to include the header.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and they included the header. However, for the forecast, we are only to output the data.\n\n    Let me re-read: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n    The \"complete data\" meaning the next 96 rows? without the header? because the header is not part of the data.\n\n    The example input had:\n\n               date   HUFL\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00 13.329\n\n    So we will output:\n\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00 <value>\n        ...\n\n    without the header.\n\n 30. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 31. We'll create the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-24 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-12-24 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We'll use the same time format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 33. We'll assign the hourly averages for each day.\n\n 34. Code for generating the dates in Python (for our reference):\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2016, 24, 12)\n        But note: the last date in the input is 2016-12-23 23:00:00, so next is 2016-12-24 00:00:00.\n\n        We can generate:\n\n            base = datetime(2016, 12, 24, 0, 0, 0)\n            for day in range(4):\n                for hour in range(24):\n                    date = base + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                    # but note: we are iterating by hour, so we can do:\n                    # date = base + timedelta(hours= i) for i in range(96)\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            start_date = datetime(2016, 12, 24, 0, 0, 0)\n            dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 35. But we are not coding, so we'll write the dates manually?
