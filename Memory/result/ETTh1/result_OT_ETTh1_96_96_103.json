        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are exactly 96 records without any missing entries in the given period.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. Since the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, we assume that the missing values might have been already handled or we are to forecast without having to impute the history.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly data, we can consider a time series model that can capture daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 3. We'll use a model that can handle multiple seasonality if needed. However, the data shows a clear daily pattern (with temperatures at night lower and during the day higher) and also a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly pattern might not be captured.\n\n 4. Given the limited history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that uses the daily seasonality.\n\n 5. We note that on 2017-08-19 there was a significant drop in temperature in the evening (from 16.461 at 19:00 to 11.818 at 20:00). This might be an anomaly or a special event. We must be cautious.\n\n 6. Since the data is hourly and we have 96 points, we can use a seasonal model with seasonality of 24.\n\n 7. We can use the Seasonal Naive method, but that would just repeat the last day (2017-08-20) for the next 4 days? But 2017-08-20 is a Sunday and the next 4 days are Monday to Thursday? So there might be a weekly pattern that we cannot capture with only 4 days.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) with additive or multiplicative seasonality. However, with only 4 days, the estimation of multiple seasonal components might be difficult.\n\n 9. Another approach is to use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would ignore the trend and any weekly effect.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we are to forecast 96 points. We can use a simple method: take the average of each hour and then adjust by the last day's deviation? But the drop on 2017-08-19 might be an outlier.\n\n 11. We note that the data from 2017-08-19 19:00 to 2017-08-20 00:00 is unusually low. This might be a data quality issue or a real event. Since we are to forecast, we must decide whether to include that in the pattern.\n\n 12. Considering the next 4 days are weekdays (starting from Monday, 2017-08-21) and the available data includes a weekend (2017-08-19 and 2017-08-20 are Saturday and Sunday), we might need to account for the difference between weekdays and weekends. However, we only have one weekend day (Sunday) and one Saturday? Actually, 2017-08-17 to 2017-08-18 are Thursday and Friday? Then 2017-08-19 (Saturday) and 2017-08-20 (Sunday). So we have two weekdays and two weekend days.\n\n 13. Without more data, it's challenging to model weekly seasonality. Therefore, we will use a model that uses daily seasonality and ignore the weekly pattern due to limited data.\n\n 14. We can use the following approach:\n     - Decompose the time series into trend and seasonal components using moving averages, but with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend and also the fact that the last two days (weekend) might be different patterns.\n\n 16. Since the problem does not specify the model, we choose a method that is robust and can handle the limited data: Seasonal Naive with the last day (2017-08-20) as the pattern for the next days? But the next days are weekdays and 2017-08-20 is Sunday. Alternatively, we can use the average of the two weekdays (2017-08-17 and 2017-08-18) for the next four weekdays? But we have to forecast 4 days and we only have two weekdays of history.\n\n 17. We decide to use the average of the same hour for the two weekdays (Thursday and Friday) and the two weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) separately? But then we have to know which days in the forecast period are weekdays. The next 4 days (2017-08-21 to 2017-08-24) are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (all weekdays). So we should use the average of the weekdays we have (2017-08-17 and 2017-08-18) for each hour.\n\n 18. However, note that 2017-08-17 and 2017-08-18 are Thursday and Friday. They might have different patterns (e.g., Friday might be different from Monday). But we don't have Monday data.\n\n 19. Given the complexity and the limited data, we choose to use the average of the two weekdays (Thursday and Friday) for the next four weekdays.\n\n 20. Steps for the method:\n     - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour from 2017-08-17 and 2017-08-18.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (Monday to Thursday), we use that average for each hour.\n\n 21. But note: the data for 2017-08-19 and 2017-08-20 (weekend) are available. We are not using them for the forecast because the forecast period is weekdays? However, we don't have evidence that weekdays and weekends are different because we only have one Thursday, one Saturday, etc. So it's risky to assume.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the average of all 4 days? That would be more stable. But then we are including weekend patterns for weekdays? That might not be accurate.\n\n 23. Considering the trade-off, and since we have very limited data, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the entire 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. This will smooth out the weekend effect and might be more robust.\n\n 24. How to compute:\n     - For hour 0: average of [2017-08-17 00:00:00, 2017-08-18 00:00:00, 2017-08-19 00:00:00, 2017-08-20 00:00:00]\n     - Similarly for hour 1, ... 23.\n\n 25. Then, for the next day (2017-08-21) at 00:00:00, we use the average for hour 0, at 01:00:00 the average for hour 1, and so on.\n\n 26. We do the same for 2017-08-22, 2017-08-23, 2017-08-24.\n\n 27. This method will produce a forecast that repeats the same daily pattern (the average of the 4 days) for the next 4 days.\n\n 28. Let's calculate the averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (14.491 + 16.108999 + 17.305 + 9.567) / 4 = (14.491+16.109+17.305+9.567)/4 = 57.472/4 = 14.368\n     But wait, the value for 2017-08-20 00:00:00 is 9.567, which is an outlier? It might be due to the event on the previous evening.\n\n 29. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of outliers? But the problem does not specify.\n\n 30. Since the drop on 2017-08-19 and 2017-08-20 might be a real event (like a power outage or maintenance) and not an outlier, and we are to forecast normal operation? We don't know. The problem does not specify.\n\n 31. We decide to use the average but note that the data on 2017-08-20 is low for the first few hours. However, if we look at the entire day of 2017-08-20, the temperatures during the day are not as low. So the average for each hour might be acceptable.\n\n 32. We'll calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n 33. Steps:\n     - Group the data by hour (i.e., the time of day: 0,1,...,23)\n     - For each hour, compute the mean of the OT over the 4 days.\n\n 34. Then, for the next 4 days (2017-08-21 to 2017-08-24), we assign the mean for hour 0 to 00:00, hour 1 to 01:00, etc.\n\n 35. We generate 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n 36. We must generate the dates as well.\n\n 37. The last date in the given data is 2017-08-20 23:00:00. The next 96 hours start from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 and go to 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n\n 38. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (14.491000 + 16.108999 + 17.305000 + 9.567000) / 4 = 14.36799975\n     Hour 1: (14.351000 + 16.039000 + 17.165001 + 7.809000) / 4 = 13.84100025\n     ... and so on.\n\n 39. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 40. Then, we create the forecast:\n\n     2017-08-21 00:00:00  [average for hour 0]\n     2017-08-21 01:00:00  [average for hour 1]\n     ...\n     2017-08-21 23:00:00  [average for hour 23]\n     2017-08-22 00:00:00  [average for hour 0]   (same as the previous day at 00:00)\n     ... until 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n\n 41. We'll write a small code in our mind to compute the averages for each hour.\n\n 42. However, note: the data for 2017-08-19 and 2017-08-20 have some very low values at night and early morning. This might be due to the weekend? But we are forecasting weekdays, so maybe we should not include the weekend? But we don't have enough data to separate.\n\n 43. Given the instructions, we proceed with the average of all 4 days.\n\n 44. We compute the averages:\n\n     Let's extract the data by hour:\n\n     Hour 0: [14.491000, 16.108999, 17.305000, 9.567000] -> average = (14.491+16.109+17.305+9.567)/4 = 57.472/4 = 14.368\n     Hour 1: [14.351000, 16.039000, 17.165001, 7.809000] -> (14.351+16.039+17.165+7.809)/4 = 55.364/4 = 13.841\n     Hour 2: [14.843000, 16.180000, 17.094000, 8.723000] -> (14.843+16.180+17.094+8.723)/4 = 56.84/4 = 14.21\n     Hour 3: [14.914000, 15.898000, 17.094000, 8.371000] -> (14.914+15.898+17.094+8.371)/4 = 56.277/4 = 14.06925\n     Hour 4: [14.914000, 15.758000, 17.024000, 11.959000] -> (14.914+15.758+17.024+11.959)/4 = 59.655/4 = 14.91375\n     Hour 5: [14.632000, 15.898000, 16.954000, 12.381000] -> (14.632+15.898+16.954+12.381)/4 = 59.865/4 = 14.96625\n     Hour 6: [14.491000, 15.687000, 16.672001, 13.014000] -> (14.491+15.687+16.672+13.014)/4 = 59.864/4 = 14.966\n     Hour 7: [14.914000, 17.165001, 17.587000, 12.874000] -> (14.914+17.165+17.587+12.874)/4 = 62.54/4 = 15.635\n     Hour 8: [16.461000, 17.305000, 18.219999, 13.366000] -> (16.461+17.305+18.220+13.366)/4 = 65.352/4 = 16.338\n     Hour 9: [17.024000, 17.235001, 18.009001, 14.984000] -> (17.024+17.235+18.009+14.984)/4 = 67.252/4 = 16.813\n     Hour 10: [17.516001, 18.009001, 18.783001, 15.687000] -> (17.516+18.009+18.783+15.687)/4 = 70.0/4 = 17.5\n     Actually: 17.516001+18.009001+18.783001+15.687000 = 69.995003 -> 17.49875075\n     Hour 11: [17.305000, 17.868000, 17.868000, 15.828000] -> (17.305+17.868+17.868+15.828)/4 = 68.869/4 = 17.21725\n     Hour 12: [17.235001, 18.500999, 19.063999, 15.828000] -> (17.235+18.501+19.064+15.828)/4 = 70.628/4 = 17.657\n     Hour 13: [18.290001, 19.205000, 19.205000, 16.039000] -> (18.290+19.205+19.205+16.039)/4 = 72.739/4 = 18.18475\n     Hour 14: [18.572001, 19.697001, 19.697001, 17.165001] -> (18.572+19.697+19.697+17.165)/4 = 75.131/4 = 18.78275\n     Hour 15: [19.063999, 19.837999, 20.190001, 17.165001] -> (19.064+19.838+20.190+17.165)/4 = 76.257/4 = 19.06425\n     Hour 16: [19.344999, 19.697001, 18.923000, 17.798000] -> (19.345+19.697+18.923+17.798)/4 = 75.763/4 = 18.94075\n     Hour 17: [18.923000, 19.416000, 17.938000, 17.516001] -> (18.923+19.416+17.938+17.516)/4 = 73.793/4 = 18.44825\n     Hour 18: [17.657000, 18.642000, 16.461000, 16.743000] -> (17.657+18.642+16.461+16.743)/4 = 69.503/4 = 17.37575\n     Hour 19: [17.235001, 18.079000, 11.818000, 15.054000] -> (17.235+18.079+11.818+15.054)/4 = 62.186/4 = 15.5465\n     Hour 20: [17.094000, 17.798000, 9.426000, 14.703000] -> (17.094+17.798+9.426+14.703)/4 = 59.021/4 = 14.75525\n     Hour 21: [16.391001, 17.798000, 8.723000, 14.843000] -> (16.391+17.798+8.723+14.843)/4 = 57.755/4 = 14.43875\n     Hour 22: [16.461000, 17.798000, 12.381000, 14.703000] -> (16.461+17.798+12.381+14.703)/4 = 61.343/4 = 15.33575\n     Hour 23: [15.898000, 17.165001, 13.014000, 14.703000] -> (15.898+17.165+13.014+14.703)/4 = 60.78/4 = 15.195\n\n 45. Now, we create the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating these 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n 46. The dates:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-08-21\n       00:00:00 -> 14.368\n       01:00:00 -> 13.841\n       ... until 23:00:00 -> 15.195\n\n     Day 2: 2017-08-22\n       00:00:00 -> 14.368\n       01:00:00 -> 13.841\n       ... \n\n     Day 3: 2017-08-23\n       00:00:00 -> 14.368\n       ...\n\n     Day 4: 2017-08-24\n       ... until 23:00:00 -> 15.195\n\n 47. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 48. We note that the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 49. However, the averages we computed are more precise. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 50. Let's round the averages:\n\n     Hour0: 14.368 -> 14.368\n     Hour1: 13.841 -> 13.841\n     Hour2: 14.21 -> 14.210\n     Actually, we computed 14.21? But we had 14.84/4? Let me recalc: \n        Hour2: (14.843+16.180+17.094+8.723) = 56.84 -> 56.84/4=14.21 -> 14.210\n     Hour3: 14.06925 -> 14.069\n     Hour4: 14.91375 -> 14.914\n     Hour5: 14.96625 -> 14.966\n     Hour6: 14.966 -> 14.966\n     Hour7: 15.635 -> 15.635\n     Hour8: 16.338 -> 16.338\n     Hour9: 16.813 -> 16.813\n     Hour10: 17.49875075 -> 17.499\n     Hour11: 17.21725 -> 17.217\n     Hour12: 17.657 -> 17.657\n     Hour13: 18.18475 -> 18.185\n     Hour14: 18.78275 -> 18.783\n     Hour15: 19.06425 -> 19.064\n     Hour16: 18.94075 -> 18.941\n     Hour17: 18.44825 -> 18.448\n     Hour18: 17.37575 -> 17.376\n     Hour19: 15.5465 -> 15.547\n     Hour20: 14.75525 -> 14.755\n     Hour21: 14.43875 -> 14.439\n     Hour22: 15.33575 -> 15.336\n     Hour23: 15.195 -> 15.195\n\n 51. Now, we write the forecast.\n\n 52. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-08-21 00:00:00\n     Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n\n 53. We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        date                OT\n        2017-08-21 00:00:00 14.368\n        2017-08-21 01:00:00 13.841\n        ...\n\n 54. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 55. We must output exactly 96 records.\n\n 56. We write the answer in the required XML tags.\n\n 57.
