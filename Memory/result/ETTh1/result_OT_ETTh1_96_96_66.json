        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with time series data, we need to choose a forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (4 days) and the hourly data, \n we can observe that there is a daily seasonality (24 hours). Also, note that the data might have a trend and other patterns.\n\n We can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (possibly linear or damped)\n   - Seasonality (with period of 24)\n\n Suitable models: \n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n\n However, note that we only have 4 days of data. This is a very short series for fitting a model with multiple seasonal parameters.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler model or even a naive approach. But the problem requires 96 points forecast.\n\n Given the constraints, we can try:\n   - Using a seasonal decomposition and then forecasting the components.\n   - Using a simple moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern (with higher temperatures during the day and lower at night? Actually, looking at the data, \n the pattern is not exactly typical because of the load on the transformer). However, we see that the temperature fluctuates throughout the day.\n\n Since the data is short, we are limited. We can use:\n   - The last 24 hours as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n   - Or use a naive seasonal forecast: forecast the next 24 hours as the last 24 hours, then the next 24 as the one before the last, but that would be the same as the last.\n\n However, we note that there might be a trend. For example, the temperature seems to be increasing over the 4 days.\n\n Let me try to model with a simple linear trend and daily seasonality.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   - We can use a linear regression with time index and dummy variables for the 24 hours? But we have only 4 days -> 4 observations per hour -> very few.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more robust method: STL decomposition (if we had more data) or use exponential smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n Given the data length, we can try to fit an ETS model with additive seasonality and a trend. But note: the seasonality period is 24, and we have 96/24=4 cycles.\n\n We can use the `statsmodels` library in Python to fit an ETS model, but since we are not running code, we have to reason.\n\n However, the problem says we must provide the complete data. So we have to generate 96 numbers.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can do:\n\n  1. Calculate the average day from the 4 days we have (by averaging the same hour across the 4 days).\n  2. Then, we can look at the overall trend. We can fit a linear trend to the entire series and then project that trend forward for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data does not show a clear linear trend? Let's check:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-03-22: min=1.548, max=8.864\n   Day 2: 2017-03-23: min=4.291, max=10.060\n   Day 3: 2017-03-24: min=3.799, max=9.989\n   Day 4: 2017-03-25: min=7.316, max=11.044\n\n The maximum temperature is increasing: 8.864 -> 10.060 -> 9.989 -> 11.044 -> so not strictly increasing.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 24 hours and then add a drift (average change from day to day) for the next day.\n\n However, the problem requires 96 points. We can break the forecast into 4 segments of 24 hours each.\n\n Approach:\n\n  Step 1: Decompose the series into a trend component and a seasonal component (using additive model) with period=24.\n\n  How to do without code?\n    - We can compute the trend by taking a moving average of 24 hours (centered) but for the ends we can use a smaller window? \n      However, we have only 96 points, so we can compute the trend = moving average of 24 points (but that would leave the first 12 and last 12 without trend?).\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of each day to represent the daily level and then compute the trend from the daily levels.\n\n  Step 1.1: Compute the daily average (or median) for each day.\n\n    Day1 (2017-03-22): average = (8.160+8.301+...+8.020)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n        We can skip exact calculation because we are not running, but we can note that the values are around 5-8? \n        Actually, we don't need the exact number because we are going to use the same method for the entire series.\n\n  Step 1.2: Then, we can fit a linear regression to the daily averages to get a trend.\n\n  Step 1.3: Then, for each day, we can compute the daily average and subtract it from the original series to get the seasonal component (for each hour).\n\n  Step 1.4: Then, average the seasonal component for each hour (across the 4 days) to get the seasonal indices.\n\n  Step 1.5: Then, project the trend for the next 4 days (so we get 4 daily levels).\n\n  Step 1.6: For each future day, we take the projected daily level and add the seasonal index for that hour.\n\n  But note: the trend is for the daily average, so we are assuming the daily level changes linearly.\n\n  However, we have only 4 points for the daily averages -> we can fit a linear regression: \n      Day1:\n      Day2: \n      Day3:\n      Day4:\n\n  Then for Day5, Day6, Day7, Day8 we can project.\n\n  But note: the data ends at 2017-03-25 (day4). Then the next 96 hours are 4 days: 2017-03-26, 27, 28, 29.\n\n  Step 2: Implementation without code:\n\n    a) Compute daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2017-03-22): \n            sum = 8.160+8.301+6.472+6.191+4.854+3.728+3.939+4.784+4.854+5.276+4.432+3.588+3.869+2.814+3.728+1.688+1.548+1.759+4.502+4.854+5.346+6.120+6.683+8.020\n            = let's calculate step by step:\n\n            Grouping:\n            8.160+8.301 = 16.461\n            +6.472 = 22.933\n            +6.191 = 29.124\n            +4.854 = 33.978\n            +3.728 = 37.706\n            +3.939 = 41.645\n            +4.784 = 46.429\n            +4.854 = 51.283\n            +5.276 = 56.559\n            +4.432 = 60.991\n            +3.588 = 64.579\n            +3.869 = 68.448\n            +2.814 = 71.262\n            +3.728 = 74.990\n            +1.688 = 76.678\n            +1.548 = 78.226\n            +1.759 = 79.985\n            +4.502 = 84.487\n            +4.854 = 89.341\n            +5.346 = 94.687\n            +6.120 = 100.807\n            +6.683 = 107.490\n            +8.020 = 115.510\n\n            Average = 115.510 / 24 = 4.8129\n\n        Day2 (2017-03-23): \n            data: 8.864,9.215,8.653,9.849,10.060,7.527,9.215,8.864,8.160,8.653,7.597,8.371,7.386,8.020,7.949,8.090,7.316,6.472,7.105,7.035,6.050,7.527,5.206,4.291\n            sum = 8.864+9.215+8.653+9.849+10.060+7.527+9.215+8.864+8.160+8.653+7.597+8.371+7.386+8.020+7.949+8.090+7.316+6.472+7.105+7.035+6.050+7.527+5.206+4.291\n            = 8.864+9.215=18.079\n            +8.653=26.732\n            +9.849=36.581\n            +10.060=46.641\n            +7.527=54.168\n            +9.215=63.383\n            +8.864=72.247\n            +8.160=80.407\n            +8.653=89.060\n            +7.597=96.657\n            +8.371=105.028\n            +7.386=112.414\n            +8.020=120.434\n            +7.949=128.383\n            +8.090=136.473\n            +7.316=143.789\n            +6.472=150.261\n            +7.105=157.366\n            +7.035=164.401\n            +6.050=170.451\n            +7.527=177.978\n            +5.206=183.184\n            +4.291=187.475\n\n            Average = 187.475 / 24 = 7.8115\n\n        Day3 (2017-03-24): \n            data: 5.206,3.799,4.573,5.417,5.839,5.979,6.472,6.683,6.542,5.698,5.346,6.613,7.457,7.175,6.120,5.909,4.502,5.628,7.879,9.497,9.075,8.864,8.723,9.356\n            sum = 5.206+3.799=9.005\n            +4.573=13.578\n            +5.417=18.995\n            +5.839=24.834\n            +5.979=30.813\n            +6.472=37.285\n            +6.683=43.968\n            +6.542=50.510\n            +5.698=56.208\n            +5.346=61.554\n            +6.613=68.167\n            +7.457=75.624\n            +7.175=82.799\n            +6.120=88.919\n            +5.909=94.828\n            +4.502=99.330\n            +5.628=104.958\n            +7.879=112.837\n            +9.497=122.334\n            +9.075=131.409\n            +8.864=140.273\n            +8.723=148.996\n            +9.356=158.352\n\n            Average = 158.352 / 24 = 6.598\n\n        Day4 (2017-03-25): \n            data: 9.778,9.567,9.919,9.989,10.060,10.130,9.778,9.778,8.864,7.316,7.457,8.160,8.864,9.778,9.989,10.271,9.215,9.215,10.693,10.693,10.763,11.044,10.271,10.130\n            sum = 9.778+9.567=19.345\n            +9.919=29.264\n            +9.989=39.253\n            +10.060=49.313\n            +10.130=59.443\n            +9.778=69.221\n            +9.778=79.000\n            +8.864=87.864\n            +7.316=95.180\n            +7.457=102.637\n            +8.160=110.797\n            +8.864=119.661\n            +9.778=129.439\n            +9.989=139.428\n            +10.271=149.699\n            +9.215=158.914\n            +9.215=168.129\n            +10.693=178.822\n            +10.693=189.515\n            +10.763=200.278\n            +11.044=211.322\n            +10.271=221.593\n            +10.130=231.723\n\n            Average = 231.723 / 24 = 9.6551\n\n        So the daily averages: \n          Day1: 4.8129\n          Day2: 7.8115\n          Day3: 6.598\n          Day4: 9.6551\n\n    b) Fit a linear trend to these daily averages:\n\n        Let t=1 for Day1, t=2 for Day2, t=3 for Day3, t=4 for Day4.\n\n        We want to fit: y = a + b*t\n\n        We can use least squares:\n\n        t = [1,2,3,4]\n        y = [4.8129, 7.8115, 6.598, 9.6551]\n\n        n = 4\n        sum_t = 1+2+3+4 = 10\n        sum_y = 4.8129+7.8115+6.598+9.6551 = 28.8775\n        sum_t2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n        sum_ty = 1*4.8129 + 2*7.8115 + 3*6.598 + 4*9.6551 \n                = 4.8129 + 15.623 + 19.794 + 38.6204\n                = 78.8503\n\n        b = (n * sum_ty -

So we can adjust:\n\n          Let S_h be the average for hour h (without adjustment). Then the mean of all S_h should be zero. \n          If not, we subtract the overall mean.\n\n        But for simplicity, we can compute the 24 indices and then center them.\n\n        However, we are not going to compute all 24 by hand in detail? We have to do it for the forecast.\n\n        But note: the problem requires the complete data. We have to output 96 numbers.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from the 4 days). We average them to get the raw seasonal index.\n\n          Then, we compute the overall average of these 24 raw indices. Let that be M. Then the adjusted seasonal index for hour h is: raw_index_h - M.\n\n        But we are doing it by hand, we can skip the adjustment? The effect of the mean M is that it would be absorbed in the daily level? \n        Actually, the daily level we computed is the average of the day. The seasonal indices should have mean zero per day? \n\n        Since we are using the daily average as the level, the seasonal indices must have mean zero per day. \n\n        How to ensure? We can compute the average of the 24 indices for a day? Actually, we are computing the indices for each hour and then we average over the 4 days. \n        But the daily average of the seasonal indices should be zero? \n\n        We can compute the average of the 24 raw indices: \n          total_sum = sum_{h=0}^{23} [ (value_day1_h - daily_avg1) + ... + (value_day4_h - daily_avg4) ] / (4*24)\n          = [ (sum of all values in 4 days) - (sum of daily_avg1*24 + ... + daily_avg4*24) ] / (4*24)\n          = [ (sum of all 96 points) - (24*(4.8129+7.8115+6.598+9.6551)) ] / 96\n          = [ (115.510 + 187.475 + 158.352 + 231.723) - 24*28.8775 ] / 96\n          = [ 693.06 - 693.06 ] / 96 = 0.\n\n        So the raw indices we compute for each hour (by averaging the deviations) will automatically have a mean of zero? \n        Actually, the sum of the deviations for a single day_i is: \n            sum_{h} (value_{i,h} - daily_avg_i) = 0.\n        Therefore, the average of the 24 deviations for a day is zero. \n\n        When we average over the 4 days for a fixed hour h, the average of the deviations for that hour is the raw seasonal index for h. \n        And the average of these raw indices over 24 hours is the average of 4 daily zeros? -> zero.\n\n        So we don't need to adjust.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute the seasonal index for each hour h as the average of (value_{day_i, h} - daily_avg_i) for i=1,2,3,4.\n\n        We do this for each hour.\n\n        Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n          Day1: 8.160 - 4.8129 = 3.3471\n          Day2: 8.864 - 7.8115 = 1.0525\n          Day3: 5.206 - 6.598 = -1.392\n          Day4: 9.778 - 9.6551 = 0.1229\n          Average = (3.3471+1.0525-1.392+0.1229)/4 = (3.1305)/4 = 0.7826\n\n        But wait, the average of these four numbers: (3.3471+1.0525-1.392+0.1229)= 3.1305 -> 3.1305/4=0.7826.\n\n        Similarly, we compute for hour1 (01:00:00):\n          Day1: 8.301 - 4.8129 = 3.4881\n          Day2: 9.215 - 7.8115 = 1.4035\n          Day3: 3.799 - 6.598 = -2.799\n          Day4: 9.567 - 9.6551 = -0.0881\n          Average = (3.4881+1.4035-2.799-0.0881)/4 = (2.0045)/4 = 0.5011\n\n        We do for all 24 hours.\n\n        However, we are not going to do all 24 by hand? We have to, because we need 96 numbers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write a program, but the problem is we are an AI and we have to reason.\n\n        Since we are limited, we can do:\n\n          We will compute the seasonal indices for each hour and then use them.\n\n        But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data. So we have to generate 96 numbers.\n\n        We can do the computation for all 24 hours and then use them for the next 4 days.\n\n        Let me compute a few more to see the pattern:\n\n        Hour2 (02:00:00):\n          Day1: 6.472 - 4.8129 = 1.6591\n          Day2: 8.653 - 7.8115 = 0.8415\n          Day3: 4.573 - 6.598 = -2.025\n          Day4: 9.919 - 9.6551 = 0.2639\n          Average = (1.6591+0.8415-2.025+0.2639)/4 = (0.7395)/4 = 0.1849\n\n        Hour3 (03:00:00):\n          Day1: 6.191 - 4.8129 = 1.3781\n          Day2: 9.849 - 7.8115 = 2.0375\n          Day3: 5.417 - 6.598 = -1.181\n          Day4: 9.989 - 9.6551 = 0.3339\n          Average = (1.3781+2.0375-1.181+0.3339)/4 = (2.5685)/4 = 0.6421\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n        This is very time-consuming. We have to do 24 hours. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the provided data to compute the seasonal indices for each hour and then use them.\n\n        We'll do it in a tabular form mentally? \n\n        But note: the problem does not require the exact numbers to be perfect, but we must provide the complete data.\n\n        We can approximate? \n\n        We can use the last day's pattern? But that might not be representative.\n\n        Given the time, we decide to compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours and then use them.\n\n        We'll do the computation and then list the indices:\n\n        Hour0: (8.160-4.8129, 8.864-7.8115, 5.206-6.598, 9.778-9.6551) -> (3.3471, 1.0525, -1.392, 0.1229) -> avg= (3.3471+1.0525-1.392+0.1229)/4 = 3.1305/4=0.7826\n        Hour1: (8.301-4.8129, 9.215-7.8115, 3.799-6.598, 9.567-9.6551) -> (3.4881, 1.4035, -2.799, -0.0881) -> (3.0045)/4=0.7511?

But in the response, we have to list 96 lines.\n\n    We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-26 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n    We'll compute:\n\n        For day_index in [5,6,7,8]:\n            daily_level = 3.8911 + 1.33131 * day_index\n            Then for hour in range(0,24):\n                OT = daily_level + seasonal_index[hour]\n\n    We already have the seasonal indices in a list.\n\n    Let me list the seasonal indices again (0 to 23):\n\n        s = [\n            0.7826, 0.0\n            0.5011, #1\n            0.1849, #2\n            0.6421, #3\n            0.4839, #4\n            -0.3784, #5\n            0.1316, #6\n            0.3079, #7\n            -0.1144, #8\n            -0.4836, #9\n            -1.0114, #10\n            -0.5351, #11\n            -0.3256, #12\n            -0.2726, #13\n            -0.2729, #14\n            -0.7299, #15\n            -1.5741, #16\n            -1.4509, #17\n            0.3254, #18\n            0.8004, #19\n            0.5891, #20\n            1.1694, #21\n            0.5014, #22\n            0.7299  #23\n        ]\n\n    Now, we compute:\n\n        Day5: t=5 -> level=3.8911+1.33131*5 = 3.8911+6.65655=10.54765\n        Day6: t=6 -> level=3.8911+1.33131*6=3.8911+7.98786=11.87896\n        Day7: t=7 -> level=3.8911+1.33131*7=3.8911+9.31917=13.21027\n        Day8: t=8 -> level=3.8911+1.33131*8=3.8911+10.65048=14.54158\n\n    Then for each day, we add the seasonal index for the hour.\n\n    We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day5: 2017-03-26\n        Day6: 2017-03-27\n        Day7: 2017-03-28\n        Day8: 2017-03-29\n\n    We write the data in order.\n\n    Note: We must be cautious of the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n    We'll output:\n\n        2017-03-26 00:00:00, <OT>\n        2017-03-26 01:00:00, <OT>\n        ... \n        2017-03-26 23:00:00, <OT>\n        2017-03-27 00:00:00, <OT>\n        ...\n\n    We'll do the computation for OT with rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n    Example for the first few of Day5:\n\n        hour0: 10.54765 + 0.7826 = 11.33025 -> 11.330\n        hour1: 10.54765 + 0.5011 = 11.04875 -> 11.049\n        ...\n\n    We'll generate all 96.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but we are generating the forecast without missing values.\n\n    We are not given any in the provided data, and we are forecasting complete.\n\n    We output in the required format.\n\n    Due to the length, we will write the data in the answer block.\n\n    <answer>\n        date,OT\n        2017-03-26 00:00:00,11.330\n        2017-03-26 01:00:00,11.049\n        ... \n    </answer>\n\n    We'll do the computation for all 96 points.\n\n    But note: the rounding might cause slight discrepancies. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n    Let's do it.\n",
