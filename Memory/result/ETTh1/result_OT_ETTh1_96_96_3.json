        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need for 96 steps, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends. The data shows daily patterns (24-hour cycle) and also some irregular fluctuations.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal ARIMA model or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or even a machine learning model. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) to forecast the next 4 days. This is a very short history.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we can try to model the daily seasonality (period=24). We'll use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data has a drop on the 15th and 16th? We must be cautious.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: take the average of the same hour from the previous 4 days? But we only have 4 days of history. We can use the last day (day 4) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might not be robust.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we will use a simple model: Seasonal Naive method. In this method, the forecast for a particular hour is the value of that hour from the same day in the previous cycle. Since we have 4 days, we can use the last day (2016-07-16) as the base for the next day? But note: we are forecasting 4 days ahead. We can use the entire 4 days to compute the average for each hour and then use that as the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days? \n\n 9. However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n 10. We can also use a moving average method for each hour. But we have only 4 points for each hour (4 days). We can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for that hour in the next 4 days? \n\n 11. But note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (2016-07-16) and the first day (2016-07-13). The temperatures on 2016-07-16 are generally lower? \n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-07-16) and add a small adjustment? But without a clear trend, it's risky.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. This will capture the daily seasonality and smooth out some noise.\n\n 14. Steps for the method:\n     - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n     - For each hour, compute the average of the 4 values we have for that hour (from the 4 days).\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will use the average for the corresponding hour.\n\n 15. But note: we are only forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So we will have 24 distinct hours, and we will repeat the same 24-hour pattern for 4 days.\n\n 16. However, the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n 17. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (36.509998 + 34.540001 + 31.304001 + 26.943001) / 4\n     ... and so on for each hour.\n\n 18. Then, for the next 96 hours (starting at 2016-07-17 00:00:00), we assign:\n       2016-07-17 00:00:00 -> average of hour0\n       2016-07-17 01:00:00 -> average of hour1\n       ... \n       2016-07-17 23:00:00 -> average of hour23\n       2016-07-18 00:00:00 -> average of hour0\n       ... until 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n 19. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 20. However, note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Also, the drop in temperature on the last day might be due to a weekend? (But we don't have day of week). We are not accounting for that.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-07-16) as the forecast? But that would ignore the first three days. The average is a compromise.\n\n 22. We'll compute the average for each hour.\n\n 23. But note: the data provided ends at 2016-07-16 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n       2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n 24. We must generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 25. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We have 4 days: 2016-07-13, 2016-07-14, 2016-07-15, 2016-07-16.\n\n     For hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        2016-07-13: 36.509998\n        2016-07-14: 34.540001\n        2016-07-15: 31.304001\n        2016-07-16: 26.943001\n        average = (36.509998 + 34.540001 + 31.304001 + 26.943001) / 4 = 32.32425\n\n     For hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        2016-07-13: 36.721001\n        2016-07-14: 32.710999\n        2016-07-15: 32.640999\n        2016-07-16: 27.365000\n        average = (36.721001 + 32.710999 + 32.640999 + 27.365000) / 4 = 32.3595\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 26. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 27. Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 28. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can compute the average without imputation.\n\n 29. But if in the future we have missing values, we would need to impute. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we might have to handle missing values in the provided data? But the provided data does not have any. So we proceed.\n\n 30. We can write a small code in our mind to compute the averages.\n\n 31. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model? But with only 96 points and the need for 96-point forecast, and the fact that we are to provide the complete data, we choose this simple method.\n\n 32. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour and then average.\n\n 33. Due to the manual computation being error-prone, we can do it programmatically in our mind? But we are an AI, so we can compute.\n\n 34. We'll write a table:\n\n     Hour 0: [36.509998, 34.540001, 31.304001, 26.943001] -> 32.32425\n     Hour 1: [36.721001, 32.710999, 32.640999, 27.365000] -> 32.3595\n     Hour 2: [36.580002, 33.907001, 33.344002, 28.350000] -> 33.045251\n     Hour 3: [37.706001, 34.681000, 33.344002, 28.350000] -> 33.520251\n     Hour 4: [37.706001, 35.666000, 34.611000, 28.350000] -> 34.08325\n     Hour 5: [37.636002, 34.470001, 33.907001, 27.927999] -> 33.485251\n     Hour 6: [37.002998, 35.313999, 34.540001, 27.716999] -> 33.643499\n     Hour 7: [38.549999, 33.837002, 35.384998, 29.896999] -> 34.417\n     Hour 8: [38.057999, 35.876999, 34.328999, 30.179001] -> 34.6109995\n     Hour 9: [37.002998, 35.525002, 31.586000, 31.445000] -> 33.8895\n     Hour 10: [37.002998, 36.580002, 31.375000, 33.415001] -> 34.59325025\n     Hour 11: [29.827000, 37.354000, 30.742001, 33.203999] -> 32.7815\n     Hour 12: [32.852001, 34.611000, 31.586000, 32.852001] -> 32.9755005\n     Hour 13: [36.158001, 33.837002, 31.375000, 33.203999] -> 33.6435005\n     Hour 14: [35.806999, 33.203999, 31.023001, 34.048000] -> 33.5205\n     Hour 15: [37.776001, 34.681000, 25.816999, 35.525002] -> 33.4497505\n     Hour 16: [39.535000, 36.721001, 24.903000, 35.596001] -> 34.1887505\n     Hour 17: [38.269001, 34.750999, 18.009001, 34.470001] -> 31.3745005\n     Hour 18: [34.750999, 24.903000, 22.441000, 35.596001] -> 29.42275\n     Hour 19: [33.766998, 32.852001, 16.882999, 33.625999] -> 29.281999\n     Hour 20: [32.852001, 33.132999, 22.089001, 32.007999] -> 30.02025\n     Hour 21: [33.132999, 29.968000, 24.198999, 32.007999] -> 29.826999\n     Hour 22: [34.328999, 30.389999, 25.747000, 31.726000] -> 30.547999\n     Hour 23: [35.384998, 31.375000, 26.521000, 30.882000] -> 31.0407495\n\n 35. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n     Start: 2016-07-17 00:00:00 -> Hour0: 32.32425\n           2016-07-17 01:00:00 -> Hour1: 32.3595\n           ... until 2016-07-17 23:00:00 -> Hour23: 31.0407495\n\n     Then 2016-07-18 00:00:00 -> Hour0: 32.32425\n          2016-07-18 01:00:00 -> Hour1: 32.3595\n          ... and so on until 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n 36. We must format the numbers to 6 decimal places? The original data had 6 decimal places. But we see the original data had up to 6. We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 37. However, note that the original data had some with 3 and some with 6? Actually, they are floats. We'll output as float with 6 decimal places.\n\n 38. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n     Start: 2016-07-17 00:00:00\n     Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 39. We write the data in the format:\n\n        date,OT\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00,32.324250\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00,32.359500\n        ...\n\n 40. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 41. Let's do it.\n\n 42. We'll create a list of the 24 averages (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 43. The averages we computed above (rounded to 6 decimal places):\n\n     Hour0: 32.324250 -> 32.324250\n     Hour1: 32.359500 -> 32.359500\n     Hour2: 33.045251 -> 33.045251\n     Hour3: 33.520251 -> 33.520251\n     Hour4: 34.083250 -> 34.083250\n     Hour5: 33.485251 -> 33.485251\n     Hour6: 33.643499 -> 33.643499\n     Hour7: 34.417000 -> 34.417000\n     Hour8: 34.611000 -> 34.611000   (we had 34.6109995 -> rounded to 34.611000)\n     Hour9: 33.889500 -> 33.889500\n     Hour10: 34.593250 -> 34.593250\n     Hour11: 32.781500 -> 32.781500\n     Hour12: 32.975500 -> 32.975500   (32.9755005 -> 32.975501? But we'll use 6 decimal, so 32.975501? But let's check: 32.9755005 is closer to 32.975501? However, the original data had 3 decimal? But we'll output 6. We can round to 6 decimal places.)\n\n     Actually, we should round to 6 decimal places. But note: the original data had 3 to 6. We'll keep the same precision as the input? We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n     We'll round to 6 decimal places:\n\n        Hour0: 32.324250\n        Hour1: 32.359500\n        Hour2: 33.045251 -> 33.045251\n        ... but we can keep as is and format to 6 decimal.\n\n     We'll format each number to have 6 decimal places.\n\n 44. We'll recalc to be precise:\n\n     Hour0: (36.509998 + 34.540001 + 31.304001 + 26.943001) / 4 = 129.297001 / 4 = 32.32425025 -> rounded to 6 decimals: 32.324250\n     Similarly, we'll round each to 6 decimals.\n\n 45.
