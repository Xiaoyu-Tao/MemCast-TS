        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hours of data (from 2017-03-30 00:00:00 to 2017-04-02 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of the \"MULL\" time series.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for the provided 96 points, we have complete data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we have to generate the timestamps and the forecasted MULL values.\n\n 4. We note that the data shows a daily pattern (with negative values during the day and positive at night? but also with some variation). Also, note that on 2017-03-31, the data is constant at -1.599 for the entire day. This might be an anomaly or missing data that was filled with a constant? However, we are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 5. We can use a time series model. Given the data size (96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we can consider:\n    - Seasonal decomposition: the seasonality seems daily (24 hours) but we also have a weekly pattern? (only 4 days provided, so we cannot see weekly). We have 4 days, so we can only model daily seasonality.\n\n 6. We might use a model like SARIMA, but with only 96 points and a seasonality of 24, the model might be complex. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) or even a naive seasonal method.\n\n 7. However, note the requirement: we must provide the complete data for the next 96 points. We are not asked for the code, just the forecast.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Since the data has a strong daily pattern, we can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust for the last known point? But note the anomaly on 2017-03-31 (constant). We have to decide how to handle that.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the last two days (which are more normal: 2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02) to compute the daily pattern and then project forward.\n\n 10. But note: the data from 2017-03-30 and 2017-03-31 are also provided. However, 2017-03-31 is constant and might be an anomaly. We might exclude it.\n\n 11. Approach:\n     - We'll use the last two days (2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02) as the pattern for the next days. Why? Because 2017-03-30 is also a valid day, but 2017-03-31 is constant and 2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02 are consecutive and show a similar pattern (with some variation).\n\n 12. However, we have 4 days of data. We can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days? But the constant day will pull the average to -1.599. That might not be representative.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the median of the same hour for the 4 days? But 4 days is very few.\n\n 14. Another idea: use the last day (2017-04-02) and the day before (2017-04-01) and average them to form a two-day pattern. Then we repeat that pattern for the next 4 days? But we need 4 days? No, we need 4 days? Actually, we need 96 hours (4 days). So we can repeat the two-day pattern twice? But the two days are different.\n\n 15. We can break the next 96 hours (4 days) as:\n     Day1: similar to 2017-04-01 (Saturday) but note: 2017-04-01 is Saturday and 2017-04-02 is Sunday. The next day would be Monday (2017-04-03). We don't have data for Monday. So we cannot rely on weekly seasonality.\n\n 16. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a simple method: \n     - Use the average of the last two days (2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02) for each hour to form a \"template\" day. Then, for the next 4 days, we use that template day repeated 4 times? But that would be 4 identical days? We need 4 days, so we can use the same template for each day? \n\n 17. However, note that the two days are different. We can take the average of the two days for each hour? \n\n 18. Steps for the average method:\n     - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of the two days (2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02) at that hour.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 19. But what about the trend? The data might have a trend? We have only 4 days, and the last two days are the most recent. We are not accounting for any trend. \n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-04-02) as the pattern for the next day, then the day before (2017-04-01) for the next, and then repeat? But that would be arbitrary.\n\n 21. Given the simplicity and the lack of a clear trend (and the fact that we have only 4 days, with one being constant), we decide to use the average of the two normal days (2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02) for each hour to form a daily pattern, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 22. How to compute the average for each hour:\n     - For hour 0: (2017-04-01 00:00:00 -> 0.497 and 2017-04-02 00:00:00 -> -0.959) -> average = (0.497 - 0.959)/2 = -0.231\n     - Similarly for each hour.\n\n 23. But note: the data for 2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02 are complete? Yes, 24 hours each.\n\n 24. We'll create a list of 24 values (the average for each hour) and then repeat that list 4 times to cover 96 hours.\n\n 25. However, we are forecasting 4 days, so 4 repetitions.\n\n 26. But wait: the last day in the data is 2017-04-02. The next day is 2017-04-03, then 2017-04-04, 2017-04-05, 2017-04-06.\n\n 27. We generate the timestamps: \n     - Start: 2017-04-03 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-04-06 23:00:00.\n\n 28. Steps to compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the two days (2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02):\n\n     hour0: (0.497 + (-0.959)) / 2 = -0.231\n     hour1: (0.320 + (-0.497)) / 2 = -0.0885\n     ... and so on.\n\n 29. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 30. Then, the forecast for:\n       2017-04-03 00:00:00: -0.231\n       2017-04-03 01:00:00: -0.0885\n       ... \n       2017-04-03 23:00:00: [average of hour23 of the two days]\n       2017-04-04 00:00:00: same as 2017-04-03 00:00:00? Actually, we are repeating the same daily pattern.\n\n 31. But note: the two days are consecutive, but they are different. We are averaging to get a typical day? \n\n 32. We'll do the averaging and then round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 33. However, note that the data has negative values and the range is from about -2.5 to 2.8.\n\n 34. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: (0.497 + (-0.959)) / 2 = -0.231\n        hour1: (0.320 + (-0.497)) / 2 = -0.0885 -> -0.089\n        hour2: (0.071 + (-0.711)) / 2 = -0.32\n        hour3: (0.853 + (-0.178)) / 2 = 0.3375 -> 0.338\n        hour4: (0.533 + (-1.244)) / 2 = -0.3555 -> -0.356\n        hour5: (1.421 + (-0.817)) / 2 = 0.302\n        hour6: (0.853 + (-1.848)) / 2 = -0.4975 -> -0.498\n        hour7: (0.640 + (-0.213)) / 2 = 0.2135 -> 0.214\n        hour8: (1.492 + 0.000) / 2 = 0.746\n        hour9: (0.497 + 0.888) / 2 = 0.6925 -> 0.693\n        hour10: (0.284 + 1.741) / 2 = 1.0125 -> 1.013\n        hour11: (1.457 + 1.954) / 2 = 1.7055 -> 1.706\n        hour12: (0.746 + 1.066) / 2 = 0.906\n        hour13: (2.025 + 2.843) / 2 = 2.434\n        hour14: (1.279 + 1.635) / 2 = 1.457\n        hour15: (0.888 + 0.959) / 2 = 0.9235 -> 0.924\n        hour16: (0.213 + (-0.569)) / 2 = -0.178\n        hour17: (-1.315 + (-1.954)) / 2 = -1.6345 -> -1.635\n        hour18: (-2.061 + (-2.310)) / 2 = -2.1855 -> -2.186\n        hour19: (-1.883 + (-2.061)) / 2 = -1.972\n        hour20: (-2.132 + (-2.097)) / 2 = -2.1145 -> -2.115\n        hour21: (-1.741 + (-2.203)) / 2 = -1.972\n        hour22: (-2.168 + (-1.031)) / 2 = -1.5995 -> -1.600\n        hour23: (-1.244 + 0.355) / 2 = -0.4445 -> -0.445\n\n 35. Now, we have 24 values for a typical day. We will use these 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 36. The next 96 hours (from 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-04-03): [ -0.231, -0.089, -0.32, ... , -0.445 ]\n        Day2 (2017-04-04): same 24 values\n        Day3 (2017-04-05): same\n        Day4 (2017-04-06): same\n\n 37. We generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-03 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-03 01:00:00, ... until 2017-04-03 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-04 00:00:00, ... until 2017-04-04 23:00:00\n        ... until 2017-04-06 23:00:00\n\n 38. We output the data in the same format: two columns, with the date and the MULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places).\n\n 39. However, note: the last day in the provided data is 2017-04-02 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2017-04-03 00:00:00.\n\n 40. We write the forecast:\n\n        date, MULL\n        2017-04-03 00:00:00, -0.231\n        2017-04-03 01:00:00, -0.089\n        ... \n\n 41. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 42. Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n 43. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we output all 96 lines.\n\n 44. We'll write the answer in the required markdown format.\n\n 45. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 46. This method is simple and might not capture the potential non-stationarity, but with the limited data and the requirement, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 47. Let's generate the data:\n\n        We have 24 values for the day: \n            [ -0.231, -0.089, -0.32, 0.338, -0.356, 0.302, -0.498, 0.214, 0.746, 0.693, 1.013, 1.706, 0.906, 2.434, 1.457, 0.924, -0.178, -1.635, -2.186, -1.972, -2.115, -1.972, -1.600, -0.445 ]\n\n        Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 48. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-03\n        Day2: 2017-04-04\n        Day3: 2017-04-05\n        Day4: 2017-04-06\n\n 49. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-03 00:00:00 -0.231\n2017-04-03 01:00:00 -0.089\n...\n2017-04-06 23:00:00 -0.445\n```\n\n        But note: the example input used a space between the date and the value? Actually, the example input used a space and then the value. However, the example had a tab or multiple spaces? In the example, it was:\n\n               date   MULL\n        2017-03-30 00:00:00  0.746\n\n        So it's a space separated? Actually, the example has two spaces after the date? But in the data, the date is a string and then the value. We'll output as:\n\n            \"2017-04-03 00:00:00 -0.231\"\n\n        But the example had the date as a string including the time, and then the value.\n\n 50. We output exactly as:\n\n        [date string] [space] [value]\n\n        with the value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 51. We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n 52. Let's do it step by step for the first day:\n\n        date = \"2017-04-03\"\n        for hour in 0 to 23:\n            time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            full_date = f\"2017-04-03 {time_str}\"\n            value = pattern[hour]\n\n        Then for the next day: \"2017-04-04\", same pattern.\n\n 53. We note that the months and days must be adjusted. After 2017-04-03 comes 2017-04-04, then 2017-04-05, then 2017-04-06.\n\n 54. We'll write the dates correctly.\n\n 55. We output in the required format.\n\n 56. We note that the problem says \"complete data\", so we output all 96 points.\n\n 57. We write the answer.\n",
