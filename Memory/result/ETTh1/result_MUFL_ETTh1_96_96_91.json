        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-30 00:00:00 to 2017-07-03 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of the MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) time series.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for forecasting, we must handle the given data appropriately.\n\n 2. We note that the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the presence of potential seasonality (daily cycles) and possible non-stationarities, we can use a model that can handle multiple seasonality. However, the data provided is only 4 days, so 4 cycles of 24 hours). We might consider a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or even a simple seasonal naive approach.\n\n 4. But note: the data has some negative values and fluctuations. Also, there is a few extreme values (like -8.457 on 2017-07-02 15:00:00). We must be cautious.\n\n 5. Since we are only given 4 days of data, building a complex model might be overfit. We can try to capture the daily seasonality (period=24) and also the overall trend.\n\n 6. However, the data shows a clear daily pattern: \n    - Higher values during the night (around 00:00 to early morning) and then a drop during the day? But looking at the data, it's not entirely consistent.\n\n 7. Let's try to decompose the series to see the trend and seasonality. But with only 4 days, the decomposition might be unstable.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - The seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day (i.e., 2017-07-03). But note: the last day (2017-07-03) has some extreme negative values? Actually, the last day (July 3) has a negative value at 11:00 (-6.467) and 15:00 (-4.335). \n\n 9. However, the data for July 3 might be an anomaly? We might consider using the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 10. Given the short history, we can use the average of the same hour for the available 4 days? But note: the data starts on June 30 and ends on July 3. So we have 4 days.\n\n 11. We can compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But the next 4 days might be similar? \n\n 12. However, the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n 13. But note: the data for July 2 and 3 have some extreme negative values. This might be outliers? We might consider using the median for each hour to be robust.\n\n 14. Steps for the method:\n     - Group the data by hour of the day (so 24 groups: hour 0, hour 1, ... hour 23).\n     - For each hour, compute the median of the 4 values we have for that hour (from the 4 days) to avoid the effect of outliers.\n     - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will use the median of each hour for the corresponding hour of the day.\n\n 15. Why median? Because on July 2 at 15:00 we have -8.457 and on July 3 at 11:00 we have -6.467, which are extreme. The median will be less affected.\n\n 16. Let's calculate the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: [6.929, 6.752, 5.153, 8.528] -> sorted: [5.153, 6.752, 6.929, 8.528] -> median = (6.752+6.929)/2 = 6.8405\n     Hour 1: [6.325, 7.569, 5.472, 7.924] -> sorted: [5.472, 6.325, 7.569, 7.924] -> median = (6.325+7.569)/2 = 6.947\n     ... and so on.\n\n 17. But note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days? \n        Day1: 2017-06-30 (Friday) to 2017-07-03 (Monday) -> 4 days: 96 hours.\n\n 18. We are to forecast the next 4 days? Actually, the next 96 hours, which is 4 days: from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n 19. We'll create a sequence of 96 timestamps starting from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-07-03 23:00:00) with hourly frequency.\n\n 20. Then, for each hour in the forecast period, we assign the median value for that hour of the day from the historical 4 days.\n\n 21. However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and we are forecasting Tuesday to Friday? So the same method might not capture weekly seasonality. But we don't have enough data for weekly.\n\n 22. Therefore, we proceed with the daily median.\n\n 23. Let's compute the median for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour and then compute the median.\n\n 24. Steps for computation:\n\n     We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n     We can group by the time of day (ignoring the date).\n\n 25. We can do:\n\n     hour0: [6.929, 6.752, 5.153, 8.528] -> median = 6.8405\n     hour1: [6.325, 7.569, 5.472, 7.924] -> median = 6.947\n     hour2: [5.934, 7.320, 4.620, 8.066] -> [4.620, 5.934, 7.320, 8.066] -> median = (5.934+7.320)/2 = 6.627\n     hour3: [5.828, 7.071, 4.833, 7.356] -> [4.833,5.828,7.071,7.356] -> median = (5.828+7.071)/2 = 6.4495\n     hour4: [5.259, 6.681, 4.229, 5.082] -> [4.229,5.082,5.259,6.681] -> median = (5.082+5.259)/2 = 5.1705\n     hour5: [6.183, 8.528, 5.295, 6.645] -> [5.295,6.183,6.645,8.528] -> median = (6.183+6.645)/2 = 6.414\n     hour6: [7.924, 7.640, 5.934, 6.858] -> [5.934,6.858,7.640,7.924] -> median = (6.858+7.640)/2 = 7.249\n     hour7: [6.005, 7.214, 5.579, 5.046] -> [5.046,5.579,6.005,7.214] -> median = (5.579+6.005)/2 = 5.792\n     hour8: [3.660, 4.939, 5.721, 2.559] -> [2.559,3.660,4.939,5.721] -> median = (3.660+4.939)/2 = 4.2995\n     hour9: [2.914, 5.970, 5.330, -1.635] -> [-1.635,2.914,5.330,5.970] -> median = (2.914+5.330)/2 = 4.122\n     hour10: [2.914, 6.290, 4.548, 0.142] -> [0.142,2.914,4.548,6.290] -> median = (2.914+4.548)/2 = 3.731\n     hour11: [2.345, 6.183, 2.843, -6.467] -> [-6.467,2.345,2.843,6.183] -> median = (2.345+2.843)/2 = 2.594\n     hour12: [5.224, 4.300, 3.625, -2.452] -> [-2.452,3.625,4.300,5.224] -> median = (3.625+4.300)/2 = 3.9625\n     hour13: [5.508, 1.137, -0.142, -3.056] -> [-3.056,-0.142,1.137,5.508] -> median = (-0.142+1.137)/2 = 0.4975\n     hour14: [0.178, 0.355, 0.497, 1.350] -> [0.178,0.355,0.497,1.350] -> median = (0.355+0.497)/2 = 0.426\n     hour15: [0.817, 1.102, -8.457, -4.335] -> [-8.457,-4.335,0.817,1.102] -> median = (-4.335+0.817)/2 = -1.759\n     hour16: [1.919, 3.944, -5.046, 1.421] -> [-5.046,1.421,1.919,3.944] -> median = (1.421+1.919)/2 = 1.670\n     hour17: [1.670, 5.686, 1.670, 2.665] -> [1.670,1.670,2.665,5.686] -> median = (1.670+2.665)/2 = 2.1675\n     hour18: [3.589, 2.843, 3.909, 1.635] -> [1.635,2.843,3.589,3.909] -> median = (2.843+3.589)/2 = 3.216\n     hour19: [4.015, 3.482, 4.051, 4.264] -> [3.482,4.015,4.051,4.264] -> median = (4.015+4.051)/2 = 4.033\n     hour20: [3.980, 4.015, 3.944, 4.833] -> [3.944,3.980,4.015,4.833] -> median = (3.980+4.015)/2 = 3.9975\n     hour21: [3.696, 3.553, 3.873, 4.691] -> [3.553,3.696,3.873,4.691] -> median = (3.696+3.873)/2 = 3.7845\n     hour22: [4.015, 3.482, 3.980, 4.158] -> [3.482,3.980,4.015,4.158] -> median = (3.980+4.015)/2 = 3.9975\n     hour23: [5.863, 3.873, 4.158, 5.401] -> [3.873,4.158,5.401,5.863] -> median = (4.158+5.401)/2 = 4.7795\n\n 26. Now, the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00) will be:\n\n     Day 1 (Tuesday, July 4): \n        00:00:00 -> hour0: 6.8405\n        01:00:00 -> hour1: 6.947\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> hour23: 4.7795\n\n     Then Day 2 (Wednesday, July 5): same 24 medians\n        ... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 27. We'll generate the timestamps and the corresponding median value for the hour.\n\n 28. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-04 00:00:00  6.8405\n2017-07-04 01:00:00  6.947\n...\n2017-07-07 23:00:00  4.7795\n```\n\n 29. We must provide 96 lines.\n\n 30. Let's note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimals to match.\n\n 31. We'll round the medians to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. The computed medians (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n    hour0: 6.841\n    hour1: 6.947\n    hour2: 6.627\n    hour3: 6.450\n    hour4: 5.171\n    hour5: 6.414\n    hour6: 7.249\n    hour7: 5.792\n    hour8: 4.300   # 4.2995 -> 4.300\n    hour9: 4.122\n    hour10: 3.731\n    hour11: 2.594\n    hour12: 3.963   # 3.9625 -> 3.963\n    hour13: 0.498   # 0.4975 -> 0.498\n    hour14: 0.426\n    hour15: -1.759\n    hour16: 1.670\n    hour17: 2.168   # 2.1675 -> 2.168\n    hour18: 3.216\n    hour19: 4.033\n    hour20: 3.998   # 3.9975 -> 3.998\n    hour21: 3.785   # 3.7845 -> 3.785\n    hour22: 3.998   # 3.9975 -> 3.998\n    hour23: 4.780   # 4.7795 -> 4.780\n\n 33. Now, we generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2017-07-04 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-07-04 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n 34. The sequence of values will be:\n\n      Day1 (July 4): [0,1,...,23] -> [6.841, 6.947, ... , 4.780]\n      Day2 (July 5): same 24 values\n      Day3 (July 6): same\n      Day4 (July 7): same\n\n 35. Write the data accordingly.\n\n 36. We output in the required format.\n\n 37. Note: The original data had negative values and we are including them (like hour15: -1.759).\n\n 38. Let's write the output.\n\n 39. We must be precise: the next timestamp after 2017-07-03 23:00:00 is 2017-07-04 00:00:00.\n\n 40. We generate:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-04 00:00:00  6.841\n2017-07-04 01:00:00  6.947\n2017-07-04 02:00:00  6.627\n2017-07-04 03:00:00  6.450\n2017-07-04 04:00:00  5.171\n2017-07-04 05:00:00  6.414\n2017-07-04 06:00:00  7.249\n2017-07-04 07:00:00  5.792\n2017-07-04 08:00:00  4.300\n2017-07-04 09:00:00  4.122\n2017-07-04 10:00:00  3.731\n2017-07-04 11:00:00  2.594\n2017-07-04 12:00:00  3.963\n2017-07-04 13:00:00  0.498\n2017-07-04 14:00:00  0.426\n2017-07-04 15:00:00  -1.759\n2017-07-04 16:00:00  1.670\n2017-07-04 17:00:00  2.168\n2017-07-04 18:00:00  3.216\n2017-07-04 19:00:00  4.033\n2017-07-04 20:00:00  3.998\n2017-07-04 21:00:00  3.785\n2017-07-04 22:00:00  3.998\n2017-07-04 23:00:00  4.780\n2017-07-05 00:00:00  6.841\n... and repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 41. We'll write 4 full days (4 * 24 = 96 lines).\n\n 42. We must be cautious: the rounding we did is to 3 decimals.\n\n 43. Let's code the generation:\n\n     We have a list of the 24 medians (rounded to 3 decimals) in order from hour0 to hour23.\n\n     medians = [6.841, 6.947, 6.627, 6.450, 5.171, 6.414, 7.249, 5.792, 4.300, 4.122, 3.731, 2.594, 3.963, 0.498, 0.426, -1.759, 1.670, 2.168, 3.216, 4.033, 3.998, 3.785, 3.998, 4.780]\n\n     Then for each day in the next 4 days (from July 4 to July 7), we assign the medians for each hour.\n\n 44. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-07-04 00:00:00\n     Then we add 96 hours.\n\n 45. We write the data in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  value\"\n\n 46.
