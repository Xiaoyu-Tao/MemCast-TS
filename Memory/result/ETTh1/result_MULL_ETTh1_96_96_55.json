        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we assume the given data is complete for the next 96 points we are to forecast might have missing values? But the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". However, we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must generate 96 points without any missing values.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 3. We can use models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple naive approach. However, given the data size (only 96 points) and the need for 96 points forecast, we must choose a model that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code, we must use a heuristic or a simple model.\n\n 5. Observing the data: \n    - The values are negative? (which might be normalized or transformed) but we can ignore the sign and focus on the pattern.\n    - There seems to be a daily pattern: \n        * The values are more negative (lower) during the night and early morning (e.g., 00:00 to 06:00) and then become less negative (higher) during the day (especially around 11:00 and 12:00) and then drop again in the evening.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal naive method: \n        - The value for the same hour in the previous day. But we have 4 days of data. We can take the average of the same hour over the available 4 days? \n        - But note: the data starts on 2017-02-06 (Monday) and ends on 2017-02-09 (Thursday). The next 96 hours would be from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n    However, we don't have the same days of the week for the next period? The next 96 hours would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\n\n    We have:\n        Day 1: Monday (2017-02-06)\n        Day 2: Tuesday (2017-02-07)\n        Day 3: Wednesday (2017-02-08)\n        Day 4: Thursday (2017-02-09)\n\n    We are forecasting:\n        Day 5: Friday (2017-02-10)\n        Day 6: Saturday (2017-02-11)\n        Day 7: Sunday (2017-02-12)\n        Day 8: Monday (2017-02-13)\n\n    Since we don't have data for Friday, Saturday, Sunday, we cannot use the same hour of the same day of the week.\n\n 7. Alternative: \n    We can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days? But note: the pattern might change for weekends.\n\n    However, without knowing the weekend pattern, we can only assume that the pattern of the next Friday is similar to the previous Monday? That might not hold.\n\n 8. Given the challenge, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for each hour. But we have only 4 points per hour.\n\n 9. We can use the last available day (Thursday) as the forecast for the next day (Friday) and then use the same pattern for the next days? But then how about Saturday and Sunday? We don't have data.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the average of the four days for each hour to forecast the next four days? That is, for hour 00:00, we take the average of the four 00:00 values and use that for the next four days at 00:00? But that would ignore the daily variation.\n\n 11. Since we are limited, we can do:\n      - For the first 24 hours (Friday, 2017-02-10) we use the values from the most recent same day of the week? But we don't have a Friday. The last Friday was 2017-02-03, which is not in the data.\n\n 12. We can use the average of the four days for each hour to generate a typical day, and then use that typical day for each of the next four days.\n\n    Steps:\n        For hour h (0 to 23):\n            avg_h = average of the MULL at hour h for the 4 days (2017-02-06, 2017-02-07, 2017-02-08, 2017-02-09)\n\n        Then, for each day in the forecast period (4 days: 2017-02-10 to 2017-02-13), at hour h, we set the forecast to avg_h.\n\n    But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the values at 00:00:\n        2017-02-06 00:00:00 -2.701\n        2017-02-07 00:00:00 -2.416\n        2017-02-08 00:00:00 -2.274\n        2017-02-09 00:00:00 -1.954 -> increasing (becoming less negative)\n\n    There is an upward trend (if we consider the values are increasing). So we might need to account for that.\n\n 13. We can do a linear regression for each hour? But we have only 4 points.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the overall trend and adjust the average.\n\n    Overall, the values are increasing (becoming less negative). We can compute the average change per day and then project.\n\n    For each hour, we can compute the linear trend and then forecast the next 4 days? But 4 points are too few for a reliable linear regression.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we decide to use the average per hour without trend, because of simplicity and the lack of data.\n\n    We calculate the average for each hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Example for hour 00:00:\n        (-2.701 + -2.416 + -2.274 + -1.954) / 4 = (-9.345) / 4 = -2.33625\n\n    Similarly for other hours.\n\n 16. Then we use this average for each hour for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. The dates for the next 96 hours (4 days) are:\n        2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-10 23:00:00\n        2017-02-11 00:00:00 to 2017-02-11 23:00:00\n        2017-02-12 00:00:00 to 2017-02-12 23:00:00\n        2017-02-13 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00\n\n 18. We generate the data by repeating the 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n 19. We must note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data. So we are generating without missing values.\n\n 20. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Step 1: Group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Step 2: Create the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-02-10 00:00:00, then 2017-02-10 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n    Step 3: For each hour in the day (0 to 23) for each of the 4 days, assign the average value for that hour.\n\n 21. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [ -2.701, -2.416, -2.274, -1.954] -> average = (-2.701 -2.416 -2.274 -1.954)/4 = -9.345/4 = -2.33625 -> -2.336\n        hour1: [ -2.594, -2.274, -2.416, -1.919] -> (-2.594 -2.274 -2.416 -1.919) = -9.203/4 = -2.30075 -> -2.301\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 23. However, note: the data we are given is exactly 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). We can reshape the MULL values into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the days.\n\n 24. We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) and then assign that average to the same hour in each of the next 4 days.\n\n 25. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [2017-02-06 00:00:00, 2017-02-07 00:00:00, 2017-02-08 00:00:00, 2017-02-09 00:00:00] -> [-2.701, -2.416, -2.274, -1.954] -> avg = -2.33625 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -2.336\n        hour1: [2017-02-06 01:00:00: -2.594, 2017-02-07 01:00:00: -2.274, 2017-02-08 01:00:00: -2.416, 2017-02-09 01:00:00: -1.919] -> \n                -2.594 -2.274 -2.416 -1.919 = -9.203 -> -9.203/4 = -2.30075 -> -2.301\n        hour2: [ -2.630, -2.452, -2.487, -1.990] -> (-2.630 -2.452 -2.487 -1.990) = -9.559 -> -9.559/4 = -2.38975 -> -2.390\n        hour3: [ -2.665, -2.594, -2.523, -2.132] -> (-2.665 -2.594 -2.523 -2.132) = -9.914 -> -9.914/4 = -2.4785 -> -2.479\n        hour4: [ -2.665, -2.701, -2.239, -2.168] -> (-2.665 -2.701 -2.239 -2.168) = -9.773 -> -9.773/4 = -2.44325 -> -2.443\n        hour5: [ -2.665, -2.630, -2.523, -2.416] -> (-2.665 -2.630 -2.523 -2.416) = -10.234 -> -10.234/4 = -2.5585 -> -2.559\n        hour6: [ -2.665, -2.630, -2.594, -2.097] -> (-2.665 -2.630 -2.594 -2.097) = -9.986 -> -9.986/4 = -2.4965 -> -2.497\n        hour7: [ -2.416, -2.523, -2.381, -2.168] -> (-2.416 -2.523 -2.381 -2.168) = -9.488 -> -9.488/4 = -2.372\n        hour8: [ -2.203, -2.132, -2.203, -1.777] -> (-2.203 -2.132 -2.203 -1.777) = -8.315 -> -8.315/4 = -2.07875 -> -2.079\n        hour9: [ -2.416, -1.492, -1.954, -1.635] -> (-2.416 -1.492 -1.954 -1.635) = -7.497 -> -7.497/4 = -1.87425 -> -1.874\n        hour10: [ -1.990, -2.061, -2.025, -0.746] -> (-1.990 -2.061 -2.025 -0.746) = -6.822 -> -6.822/4 = -1.7055 -> -1.706\n        hour11: [ -0.711, -2.168, -1.848,  0.071] -> (-0.711 -2.168 -1.848 +0.071) = -4.656 -> -4.656/4 = -1.164\n        hour12: [ -1.066, -1.954, -2.132, -0.533] -> (-1.066 -1.954 -2.132 -0.533) = -5.685 -> -5.685/4 = -1.42125 -> -1.421\n        hour13: [ -1.492, -2.132, -1.954, -0.497] -> (-1.492 -2.132 -1.954 -0.497) = -6.075 -> -6.075/4 = -1.51875 -> -1.519\n        hour14: [ -1.137, -2.168, -1.883, -0.817] -> (-1.137 -2.168 -1.883 -0.817) = -6.005 -> -6.005/4 = -1.50125 -> -1.501\n        hour15: [ -1.848, -2.203, -1.848, -1.173] -> (-1.848 -2.203 -1.848 -1.173) = -7.072 -> -7.072/4 = -1.768\n        hour16: [ -2.381, -2.061, -1.741, -1.670] -> (-2.381 -2.061 -1.741 -1.670) = -7.853 -> -7.853/4 = -1.96325 -> -1.963\n        hour17: [ -2.452, -2.203, -1.883, -2.097] -> (-2.452 -2.203 -1.883 -2.097) = -8.635 -> -8.635/4 = -2.15875 -> -2.159\n        hour18: [ -2.701, -2.559, -1.954, -2.381] -> (-2.701 -2.559 -1.954 -2.381) = -9.595 -> -9.595/4 = -2.39875 -> -2.399\n        hour19: [ -2.203, -2.097, -1.706, -1.954] -> (-2.203 -2.097 -1.706 -1.954) = -7.96 -> -7.96/4 = -1.990\n        hour20: [ -2.168, -1.812, -1.635, -1.777] -> (-2.168 -1.812 -1.635 -1.777) = -7.392 -> -7.392/4 = -1.848\n        hour21: [ -2.168, -1.954, -1.670, -1.848] -> (-2.168 -1.954 -1.670 -1.848) = -7.64 -> -7.64/4 = -1.910\n        hour22: [ -2.381, -2.203, -1.990, -2.097] -> (-2.381 -2.203 -1.990 -2.097) = -8.671 -> -8.671/4 = -2.16775 -> -2.168\n        hour23: [ -2.523, -2.452, -1.919, -2.239] -> (-2.523 -2.452 -1.919 -2.239) = -9.133 -> -9.133/4 = -2.28325 -> -2.283\n\n 26.
