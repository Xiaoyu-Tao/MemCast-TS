        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the hourly frequency, we can consider:\n    - The data might have daily seasonality (24-hour pattern).\n    - We can use a simple seasonal method or a model like SARIMA, but note that we have very limited data.\n\n However, with only 4 days, it is challenging to capture weekly patterns, but we can try to capture the daily pattern.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data is very short, we can use a naive seasonal approach: using the last available day (or an average of the past few days) as the forecast for the next days.\n\n But note: the data from 2016-11-18 to 2016-11-21 (4 days) shows some variation. We can try to compute the daily pattern by averaging the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n However, let's check the data: \n   The first day: 2016-11-18 (Friday? we don't have the day of week, but we can assume daily seasonality is the main pattern)\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   We will calculate the average of each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values. In the provided data, we don't have missing values, so we can proceed.\n\n However, let's consider: if we average the same hour over the 4 days, we get 24 average values. Then we repeat these 24 values 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n But wait: the data might have a strong daily pattern? Let's see:\n\n Example for hour 00:00:\n   2016-11-18 00:00:00 -> 3.696\n   2016-11-19 00:00:00 -> 5.401\n   2016-11-20 00:00:00 -> 3.518\n   2016-11-21 00:00:00 -> 3.589\n   Average = (3.696 + 5.401 + 3.518 + 3.589) / 4 = 16.204 / 4 = 4.051\n\n Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n However, note that the data might have a consistent pattern? But looking at the data, the values vary. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-21) as the pattern for the next day? But that might not capture the average.\n\n Considering the limited data, we choose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   Group by hour (i.e., the time of day: 0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (from 2016-11-22 to 2016-11-25), we assign the average value for each hour.\n\n But note: the next 96 hours are 4 days, so we can repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Let's create a list of 24 average values (for hours 0 to 23).\n\n   Then, we generate the dates from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours).\n\n   For each hour in the forecast period, we take the average corresponding to that hour.\n\n However, note: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture. We assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n   hour0: [3.696, 5.401, 3.518, 3.589] -> 4.051\n   hour1: [3.305, 6.076, 2.203, 3.127] -> (3.305+6.076+2.203+3.127)/4 = 14.711/4 = 3.67775\n   hour2: [3.127, 5.117, 3.447, 3.838] -> (3.127+5.117+3.447+3.838)/4 = 15.529/4 = 3.88225\n   hour3: [3.660, 5.117, 3.234, 3.518] -> (3.660+5.117+3.234+3.518)/4 = 15.529/4 = 3.88225? Wait, 3.660+5.117=8.777, +3.234=12.011, +3.518=15.529 -> 15.529/4=3.88225\n   ... and so on.\n\n But wait, let me recalculate hour3: 3.660+5.117=8.777, 8.777+3.234=12.011, 12.011+3.518=15.529 -> 15.529/4=3.88225.\n\n However, we notice that the same sum 15.529 appears for hour2 and hour3? That's a coincidence? Let me check:\n\n   hour2: 3.127, 5.117, 3.447, 3.838 -> 3.127+5.117=8.244; 8.244+3.447=11.691; 11.691+3.838=15.529 -> yes.\n   hour3: 15.529 as above.\n\n So they are the same.\n\n We'll compute all 24.\n\n Alternatively, we can write a small code in mind.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided data we don't, so we can compute the average.\n\n However, if we were to handle missing values, we would have to impute. But the problem does not specify any missing values in the provided 96 points.\n\n Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n   hour0: (3.696 + 5.401 + 3.518 + 3.589) / 4 = 16.204 / 4 = 4.051\n   hour1: (3.305 + 6.076 + 2.203 + 3.127) / 4 = 14.711 / 4 = 3.67775\n   hour2: (3.127 + 5.117 + 3.447 + 3.838) / 4 = 15.529 / 4 = 3.88225\n   hour3: (3.660 + 5.117 + 3.234 + 3.518) / 4 = 15.529 / 4 = 3.88225\n   hour4: (3.376 + 4.833 + 3.589 + 3.340) / 4 = 15.138 / 4 = 3.7845\n   hour5: (3.660 + 4.406 + 2.594 + 3.305) / 4 = 13.965 / 4 = 3.49125\n   hour6: (1.706 + 3.411 + 1.954 + 2.274) / 4 = 9.345 / 4 = 2.33625\n   hour7: (2.665 + 3.873 + 1.777 + 3.767) / 4 = 12.082 / 4 = 3.0205\n   hour8: (3.447 + 3.482 + 1.812 + 2.736) / 4 = 11.477 / 4 = 2.86925\n   hour9: (2.701 + 3.340 + 1.777 + 2.487) / 4 = 10.305 / 4 = 2.57625\n   hour10: (2.381 + 3.660 + 2.025 + 1.812) / 4 = 9.878 / 4 = 2.4695\n   hour11: (2.097 + 2.914 + 1.492 + 1.635) / 4 = 8.138 / 4 = 2.0345\n   hour12: (1.564 + 1.670 + 0.959 + 1.244) / 4 = 5.437 / 4 = 1.35925\n   hour13: (2.274 + 2.949 + 2.239 + 1.848) / 4 = 9.310 / 4 = 2.3275\n   hour14: (2.274 + 3.873 + 1.812 + 2.310) / 4 = 10.269 / 4 = 2.56725\n   hour15: (2.949 + 2.665 + 3.376 + 2.416) / 4 = 11.406 / 4 = 2.8515\n   hour16: (2.594 + 2.772 + 2.132 + 1.528) / 4 = 9.026 / 4 = 2.2565\n   hour17: (2.239 + 1.350 + 1.635 + 1.137) / 4 = 6.361 / 4 = 1.59025\n   hour18: (2.345 + 1.919 + 1.350 + 1.741) / 4 = 7.355 / 4 = 1.83875\n   hour19: (2.168 + 1.635 + 1.350 + 1.706) / 4 = 6.859 / 4 = 1.71475\n   hour20: (2.097 + 1.777 + 1.279 + 1.599) / 4 = 6.752 / 4 = 1.688\n   hour21: (1.279 + 1.954 + 0.995 + 0.142) / 4 = 4.37 / 4 = 1.0925\n   hour22: (3.056 + 2.061 + 2.381 + 1.919) / 4 = 9.417 / 4 = 2.35425\n   hour23: (4.620 + 2.772 + 2.594 + 2.985) / 4 = 12.971 / 4 = 3.24275\n\n Now, we will generate the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-11-22 00:00:00.\n\n   Day 1: 2016-11-22 (Tuesday? but we don't need the day of week) \n       00:00:00 -> 4.051\n       01:00:00 -> 3.67775\n       ... until 23:00:00 -> 3.24275\n\n   Day 2: 2016-11-23: same 24 values\n   Day 3: 2016-11-24: same\n   Day 4: 2016-11-25: same\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the forecast we are generating, we are not missing any.\n\n We must output the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Format: \n        date  MULL\n   2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n   2016-11-22 01:00:00 3.67775\n   ... \n\n However, we must round to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the input data has some with 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n Alternatively, we can output with the same precision. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   hour0: 4.051 -> 4.051 (if we round to 3 decimals, it's 4.051)\n   But let's do: \n        hour0: 4.051 -> 4.051 (we can represent as 4.051)\n        hour1: 3.67775 -> 3.678 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n Revised averages:\n\n   hour0: 4.051 -> 4.051\n   hour1: 3.67775 -> 3.678\n   hour2: 3.88225 -> 3.882\n   hour3: 3.88225 -> 3.882\n   hour4: 3.7845 -> 3.785\n   hour5: 3.49125 -> 3.491\n   hour6: 2.33625 -> 2.336\n   hour7: 3.0205 -> 3.021\n   hour8: 2.86925 -> 2.869\n   hour9: 2.57625 -> 2.576\n   hour10: 2.4695 -> 2.470\n   hour11: 2.0345 -> 2.035\n   hour12: 1.35925 -> 1.359\n   hour13: 2.3275 -> 2.328\n   hour14: 2.56725 -> 2.567\n   hour15: 2.8515 -> 2.852\n   hour16: 2.2565 -> 2.257\n   hour17: 1.59025 -> 1.590\n   hour18: 1.83875 -> 1.839\n   hour19: 1.71475 -> 1.715\n   hour20: 1.688 -> 1.688\n   hour21: 1.0925 -> 1.093\n   hour22: 2.35425 -> 2.354\n   hour23: 3.24275 -> 3.243\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-22 01:00:00 ... until 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n We'll create a list of dates by adding 96 hours to the last date in the last given date is 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n\n   Next date: 2016-11-22 00:00:00.\n\n We can generate:\n\n   dates = pd.date_range(start='2016-11-22 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n Then assign the values by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n Let's write the data:\n\n   First 24 hours (2016-11-22):\n        00:00:00 -> 4.051\n        01:00:00 -> 3.678\n        02:00:00 -> 3.882\n        03:00:00 -> 3.882\n        04:00:00 -> 3.785\n        05:00:00 -> 3.491\n        06:00:00 -> 2.336\n        07:00:00 -> 3.021\n        08:00:00 -> 2.869\n        09:00:00 -> 2.576\n        10:00:00 -> 2.470\n        11:00:00 -> 2.035\n        12:00:00 -> 1.359\n        13:00:00 -> 2.328\n        14:00:00 -> 2.567\n        15:00:00 -> 2.852\n        16:00:00 -> 2.257\n        17:00:00 -> 1.590\n        18:00:00 -> 1.839\n        19:00:00 -> 1.715\n        20:00:00 -> 1.688\n        21:00:00 -> 1.093\n        22:00:00 -> 2.354\n        23:00:00 -> 3.243\n\n   Then the next day (2016-11-23) same pattern: 4.051, 3.678, ... 3.243\n\n   And so on for 4 days.\n\n We output the complete 96 points.\n\n Format: \n        <answer>\n        date  MULL\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 3.678\n        ... \n        </answer>\n\n We must not omit any.\n\n Let's code the 24 values:\n\n   pattern = [4.051, 3.678, 3.882, 3.882, 3.785, 3.491, 2.336, 3.021, 2.869, 2.576, 2.470, 2.035, 1.359, 2.328, 2.567, 2.852, 2.257, 1.590, 1.839, 1.715, 1.688, 1.093, 2.354, 3.243]\n\n   Then we repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the pattern is for 24 hours, and we have 4 days -> 4*24=96.\n\n We'll generate the dates and then assign the pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n However, we can write the output directly.\n\n Steps for writing:\n\n   Start date: 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n   Then for i in range(96):\n        date = start + i * hour\n        value = pattern[i % 24]\n\n But we have the pattern as a list of 24.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   dates = []\n   values = []\n   start = datetime(2016,11,22,0,0,0)\n   for i in range(96):\n        date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n        value = pattern[i % 24]\n\n But we are to output as string.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   for day in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = (2016-11-22 + day days) at hour:00:00\n            value = pattern[hour]\n\n We'll do:\n\n   day0: 2016-11-22\n   day1: 2016-11-23\n   day2: 2016-11-24\n   day3: 2016-11-25\n\n So:\n\n   for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = datetime(2016,11,22) + timedelta(days=day_offset, hours=hour) -> but note: we start at 00:00:00.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016,11,22)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n   Then format the date as string: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'\n\n   But note: the input format is like '2016-11-18 00:00:00'\n\n   We'll output the same.\n\n However, we are not using any external library? We can generate the dates manually.\n\n   The first day: 2016-11-22\n        hours: 00,01,...,23\n   second day: 2016-11-23\n   third day: 2016-11-24\n   fourth day: 2016-11-25\n\n We can write:\n\n   dates = []\n   for day in [22,23,24,25]:\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date_str = f\"2016-11-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            # but note: day 22,23,24,25 are all in November 2016.\n\n   But we must be cautious: November has 30 days, so 22,23,24,25 are valid.\n\n   Then assign the value = pattern[hour] for each of these.\n\n However, note: the hour in the pattern is indexed by the hour of day (0 to 23).\n\n So we can do:\n\n   pattern = [4.051, 3.678, 3.882, 3.882, 3.785, 3.491, 2.336, 3.021, 2.869, 2.576, 2.470, 2.035, 1.359, 2.328, 2.567, 2.852, 2.257, 1.590, 1.839, 1.715, 1.688, 1.093, 2.354, 3.243]\n\n   Then for day 22: \n        hour0: pattern[0] -> 4.051\n        hour1: pattern[1] -> 3.678\n        ...\n\n   for day 23: same pattern.\n\n   for day 24: same.\n\n   for day 25: same.\n\n Now, we write the output.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are generating without missing.\n\n We output 96 lines.\n\n Let's write the first few:\n\n   2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n   2016-11-22 01:00:00 3.678\n   2016-11-22 02:00:00 3.882\n   2016-11-22 03:00:00 3.882\n   ...\n\n We must output exactly 96.\n\n We'll generate the list and then output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll outputting the data in the same format as the input (with the date and MULL value).\n\n We'll write:\n\n   <answer>\n   2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n   2016-11-22 01:00:00 3.678\n   ... (96 lines)\n   </answer>\n\n But note: the input had a header: \"date  MULL\", but the problem does not to output the header? \n\n The example input had:\n\n        date  MULL\n   2016-11-18 00:00:00 3.696\n\n But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n And the example, the data was given without the header? Actually, the example input included the header.\n\n However, the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and that included a header.\n\n But the instruction: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\" and \"remember to give me the complete data\".\n\n To be safe, we output the header? \n\n But the example output format in the problem did not specify. However, the input had two columns: 'date' and 'MULL'.\n\n We are to output the same two columns? \n\n The problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" -> but we are generating without missing.\n\n We'll output:\n\n        date  MULL\n        [date1] [value1]\n        ...\n\n But the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\"\n\n And the example input had the header.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning the data points.\n\n Since the input example included the header, we will include the header.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might not require the header? But the example input had it.\n\n We'll include the header.\n\n So:\n\n   <answer>\n   date  MULL\n   2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n   ... \n   </answer>\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete data\", and the input had the header.\n\n However, the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then listed the data with the header.\n\n So we output the header.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 points? \n\n To be safe, we output the header and then the 96 points.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might not require the header? \n\n Let me see: the example input had the header and then 96 points. We are to output the next 96 points? \n\n The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n And the example input had the header. So we output the header and then the 96 points.\n\n However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\"\n\n And the example input was given as:\n\n        date  MULL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 3.696\n        ...\n\n So we output the same.\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we output the header and the 96 points.\n\n However, the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", which are the 96 data points. But the header is not a data point.\n\n We are in a dilemma.\n\n Since the problem says \"complete data\", and the input included the header, we will include the header.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might only want the data rows? \n\n But the instruction: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\" and the example input had the header.\n\n We'll include the header.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 rows of data. The header is one extra row.\n\n However, the example input had 97 lines (header + 96 rows). \n\n So we output 97 lines? \n\n But the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", so we should outputting 96 data rows? \n\n Let me re-read: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n The word \"data\" might refer to the data points (without header) or the entire dataset (with header).\n\n Since the input was provided with a header, and we are to output in the same format, we output the header and then 96 rows.\n\n But the problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You must provide the complete data\".\n\n We'll output the header and the 96 rows.\n\n Alternatively, to be safe, we can output without the header? \n\n The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the dates are the rows.\n\n We'll output 96 rows without the header? \n\n But the example input had the header. The problem might expect the same format.\n\n However, the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then provided the header and 96 rows.\n\n So we output the header and 96 rows.\n\n But the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 rows. The header is not a date.\n\n We decide: output the header and then the 96 rows.\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete data\", and the input had the header.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   <answer>\n   date  MULL\n   2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n   ... (96 lines)\n   </answer>\n\n However, the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", so we are outputting 96 data rows? \n\n We'll outputting 97 lines (including the header). \n\n But the problem says \"complete data\", and the input had the header.\n\n We'll do as the input.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might not care about the header? \n\n But the problem says: \"You mustn't omit any content.\" and the input had the header.\n\n We include the header.\n\n Let's generate the 96 data points:\n\n   We have the pattern for 24 hours, and we repeat 4 times.\n\n   We'll create a list of 96 values: \n        values = pattern * 4   (which is [pattern[0], pattern[1], ... pattern[23], pattern[0], ...])\n\n   Then the dates:\n\n        days = [22,23,24,25] for November 2016.\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            day = 22 + i // 24\n            hour = i % 24\n            date_str = f\"2016-11-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n   But note: when i=0: day=22, hour=0 -> 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n        i=23: day=22, hour=23 -> 2016-11-22 23:00:00\n        i=24: day=23, hour=0 -> 2016-11-23 00:00:00\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        base_day = 22\n        for i in range(96):\n            day = base_day + i // 24\n            hour = i % 24\n            date_str = f\"2016-11-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\"\n\n   But note: the day must be two digits: 22,23,24,25 -> so we can use {day:02d}? Actually, 22,23,24,25 are two digits.\n\n   However, we can write: f\"2016-11-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n   But day is 22,23,24,25 -> all two digits.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2016, 11, 22, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [start + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n        Then format each date: date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n   But we are not running code, we are writing the output.\n\n   We'll generate the dates manually.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            day = 22 + i // 24\n            hour = i % 24\n            date_str = f\"2016-11-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n   But wait: when day=22, it's \"2016-11-22\", which is correct.\n\n   Then the value = pattern[hour] (for the first 24, then the next 24, etc.)\n\n   Actually, the pattern is the same for each day, so we use pattern[hour] for every i.\n\n   So:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            day = 22 + i // 24\n            hour = i % 24\n            value = pattern[hour]\n            # then output: f\"{date_str} {value}\"\n\n   But we must format the value to 3 decimal places? We have the pattern as floats with 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll output the value as is (with 3 decimal places).\n\n   However, we computed the pattern as rounded to 3 decimals, so we can output as:\n\n        value_str = f\"{value:.3f}\"\n\n   But note: some values might be integers? but in the pattern we have floats.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output the number as string with 3 decimals.\n\n   Example: 4.051 -> \"4.051\", 3.678 -> \"3.678\"\n\n   But note: 3.051 is 3.051, but if we have 3.0, we should output 3.000? \n\n   The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll format each value to have 3 decimal places.\n\n   So:\n\n        value_str = format(value, '.3f')\n\n   But we have the pattern as numbers that are already rounded to 3 decimals, but when we output we must have 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        value_str = f\"{value:.3f}\"\n\n   However, note: 4.0 would become \"4.000\", but our pattern doesn't have integers? \n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        pattern = [4.051, 3.678, 3.882, 3.882, 3.785, 3.491, 2.336, 3.021, 2.869, 2.576, 2.470, 2.035, 1.359, 2.328, 2.567, 2.852, 2.257, 1.590, 1.839, 1.715, 1.688, 1.093, 2.354, 3.243]\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            day = 22 + i // 24\n            hour = i % 24\n            date_str = f\"2016-11-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            value = pattern[hour]   # because the pattern is the same for every day, so we use the hour index\n            value_str = f\"{value:.3f}\"\n\n        Then output: f\"{date_str} {value_str}\"\n\n   But wait: the pattern is the same for every day, so we use the hour index (which is the same for the same hour of the day).\n\n   However, note: we have 4 days, and the pattern we computed is the average of the same hour over 4 days, so we are using that average for every day.\n\n   This is our forecast.\n\n   Now, we write the output.\n\n   We must include the header: \"date  MULL\"\n\n   Then 96 lines.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        date  MULL\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 3.678\n        ... \n        2016-11-25 23:00:00 3.243\n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the last date: \n        i=95: day = 22 + 95//24 = 22 + 3 (since 95//24=3, because 24*3=72, 95-72=23) -> day=25, hour=23 -> 2016-11-25 23:00:00 -> pattern[23]=3.243\n\n   Correct.\n\n   We are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are generating without missing.\n\n We are good.\n\n Let's write the first 5 and last 5:\n\n   First 5:\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 4.051\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 3.678\n        2016-11-22 02:00:00 3.882\n        2016-11-22 03:00:00 3.882\n        2016-11-22 04:00:00 3.785\n\n   Last 5:\n        ... \n        2016-11-25 19:00:00 1.715\n        2016-11-25 20:00:00 1.688\n        2016-11-25 21:00:00 1.093\n        2016-11-25 22:00:00 2.354\n        2016-11-25 23:00:00 3.243\n\n We output 97 lines (header + 96 data rows).\n\n But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", so we are outputting 96 data rows? \n\n We are outputting 96 data rows and one header row.\n\n We'll do as the input.\n\n Now, we write the answer in the required box.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
