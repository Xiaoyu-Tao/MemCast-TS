        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 points, but we are warned that there might be missing values in the data we are to forecast? \n    However, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" - but the provided past 96 are complete. We must be cautious.\n\n 2. Since we are to forecast 96 points, we must generate 96 timestamps and corresponding HUFL values.\n\n 3. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates. We must not omit any content.\n\n 4. We are to use time series forecasting. Given the data is hourly and shows some daily seasonality (with peaks and troughs in a day), we can consider a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any, though 4 days might not show a strong trend)\n    - Seasonality (daily: 24 hours cycle)\n\n 5. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). This is a very short history.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we can use a simple seasonal model. One common approach for such short-term forecasting with seasonality is to use the seasonal naive method, \n    but that would just repeat the last season (i.e., the first day of the forecast would be the same as the last day of the history, and so on). However, we see that the pattern \n    is not exactly repeating. Alternatively, we can use an average of the last few days.\n\n 7. Another approach is to use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality. But with only 4 days of history, we cannot fit a seasonal model with 24 periods.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour in the past days. Since we have 4 days, we can take the average of each hour across the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the pattern might change. However, without more history, we have to rely on the available data.\n\n 9. However, the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values. For the forecast period, we are to generate the complete data. \n    So we must fill in all 96 points.\n\n 10. Considering the above, we can do:\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 available days (2016-11-30, 2016-12-01, 2016-12-02, 2016-12-03).\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (2016-12-04 to 2016-12-07), we use the average for each hour.\n\n 11. Why average? Because it smooths out some noise and we don't have a clear trend in just 4 days.\n\n 12. But note: the last day (2016-12-03) has a different pattern? Let's check the data:\n\n      We see that the values on 2016-12-03 are generally higher than the previous days? \n\n      Example for hour 0: \n        2016-11-30 00:00:00: 12.793\n        2016-12-01 00:00:00: 9.913\n        2016-12-02 00:00:00: 11.521\n        2016-12-03 00:00:00: 14.133\n\n      The average for hour 0: (12.793 + 9.913 + 11.521 + 14.133) / 4 = 12.09\n\n      Then we would forecast 2016-12-04 00:00:00 as 12.09.\n\n 13. However, we note that the data might be increasing? But 4 days is too short to establish a trend. So we stick with the average.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we could use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? For example, exponential weights. But without a clear trend, we stick to simple average.\n\n 15. Steps for generating the forecast:\n\n      a) Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour across the 4 days.\n\n      b) The next 96 hours are 4 full days: 2016-12-04, 2016-12-05, 2016-12-06, 2016-12-07.\n\n      c) For each day, we assign the 24 hourly averages in order.\n\n 16. But note: the data we are given ends at 2016-12-03 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2016-12-04 00:00:00.\n\n 17. We must generate 96 timestamps: from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n 18. We compute the hourly averages from the 4 days we have.\n\n 19. However, let's check if there is a pattern that changes by day of the week? The given data:\n\n        2016-11-30: Wednesday\n        2016-12-01: Thursday\n        2016-12-02: Friday\n        2016-12-03: Saturday\n\n      The next 4 days:\n\n        2016-12-04: Sunday\n        2016-12-05: Monday\n        2016-12-06: Tuesday\n        2016-12-07: Wednesday\n\n      We don't have a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in the history? So we have to use the same average for all days?\n\n      But note: the pattern on Saturday (2016-12-03) might be different from weekdays? However, we only have one Saturday. We cannot model weekly seasonality with one week.\n\n 20. Therefore, we ignore the day of the week and use the same 24-hour pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 21. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n 22. How to compute the average for hour 0? We take the 4 values at 00:00:00 and average them.\n\n 23. We do the same for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n 24. Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24-hour pattern (the computed averages) for each day.\n\n 25. This will give us 96 points.\n\n 26. Let's calculate the averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (12.793 + 9.913 + 11.521 + 14.133) / 4 = (12.793+9.913=22.706; 22.706+11.521=34.227; 34.227+14.133=48.36) -> 48.36/4 = 12.09\n      Hour 1: (13.865 + 9.042 + 10.717 + 14.066) / 4 = (13.865+9.042=22.907; 22.907+10.717=33.624; 33.624+14.066=47.69) -> 47.69/4 = 11.9225\n      ... and so on.\n\n 27. We must do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. However, note: the data might have been recorded in a different time zone? But we are to take the timestamps as given.\n\n 29. We'll compute the averages and then generate the next 96 points.\n\n 30. Since the problem says there might be missing values, but the provided 96 are complete, we don't have to worry about missing values in the history. \n     For the forecast, we are generating a complete set.\n\n 31. We'll write a program to compute the averages for each hour and then repeat for 4 days.\n\n 32. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we must output 96 lines.\n\n 33. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-04 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-12-04 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-12-07 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 34. We'll compute the averages and then output.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" in the context of the data we are to forecast? But we are generating the forecast, so we are not missing any? \n We are generating a complete set.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n   Hour 0: [12.793, 9.913, 11.521, 14.133] -> 12.09\n   Hour 1: [13.865, 9.042, 10.717, 14.066] -> 11.9225\n   Hour 2: [12.190, 10.181, 9.980, 12.391] -> (12.190+10.181=22.371; 22.371+9.980=32.351; 32.351+12.391=44.742) -> 44.742/4 = 11.1855\n   Hour 3: [12.123, 9.578, 10.784, 13.329] -> (12.123+9.578=21.701; 21.701+10.784=32.485; 32.485+13.329=45.814) -> 45.814/4 = 11.4535\n   Hour 4: [13.798, 10.047, 8.640, 12.793] -> (13.798+10.047=23.845; 23.845+8.640=32.485; 32.485+12.793=45.278) -> 45.278/4 = 11.3195\n   Hour 5: [13.530, 10.315, 12.525, 12.056] -> (13.530+10.315=23.845; 23.845+12.525=36.37; 36.37+12.056=48.426) -> 48.426/4 = 12.1065\n   Hour 6: [12.525, 10.181, 13.530, 8.038] -> (12.525+10.181=22.706; 22.706+13.530=36.236; 36.236+8.038=44.274) -> 44.274/4 = 11.0685\n   Hour 7: [15.070, 11.119, 12.659, 12.726] -> (15.070+11.119=26.189; 26.189+12.659=38.848; 38.848+12.726=51.574) -> 51.574/4 = 12.8935\n   Hour 8: [10.315, 10.382, 8.306, 12.659] -> (10.315+10.382=20.697; 20.697+8.306=29.003; 29.003+12.659=41.662) -> 41.662/4 = 10.4155\n   Hour 9: [7.703, 9.310, 8.172, 8.239] -> (7.703+9.310=17.013; 17.013+8.172=25.185; 25.185+8.239=33.424) -> 33.424/4 = 8.356\n   Hour 10: [8.908, 9.444, 8.975, 8.372] -> (8.908+9.444=18.352; 18.352+8.975=27.327; 27.327+8.372=35.699) -> 35.699/4 = 8.92475\n   Hour 11: [9.176, 10.248, 10.650, 9.377] -> (9.176+10.248=19.424; 19.424+10.650=30.074; 30.074+9.377=39.451) -> 39.451/4 = 9.86275\n   Hour 12: [7.569, 7.234, 7.033, 7.100] -> (7.569+7.234=14.803; 14.803+7.033=21.836; 21.836+7.100=28.936) -> 28.936/4 = 7.234\n   Hour 13: [6.899, 7.435, 7.636, 7.301] -> (6.899+7.435=14.334; 14.334+7.636=21.97; 21.97+7.301=29.271) -> 29.271/4 = 7.31775\n   Hour 14: [7.569, 7.301, 7.636, 8.506] -> (7.569+7.301=14.87; 14.87+7.636=22.506; 22.506+8.506=31.012) -> 31.012/4 = 7.753\n   Hour 15: [7.368, 8.908, 7.234, 8.372] -> (7.368+8.908=16.276; 16.276+7.234=23.51; 23.51+8.372=31.882) -> 31.882/4 = 7.9705\n   Hour 16: [7.971, 8.707, 8.707, 8.306] -> (7.971+8.707=16.678; 16.678+8.707=25.385; 25.385+8.306=33.691) -> 33.691/4 = 8.42275\n   Hour 17: [9.578, 8.975, 8.975, 8.640] -> (9.578+8.975=18.553; 18.553+8.975=27.528; 27.528+8.640=36.168) -> 36.168/4 = 9.042\n   Hour 18: [8.975, 8.172, 8.975, 8.306] -> (8.975+8.172=17.147; 17.147+8.975=26.122; 26.122+8.306=34.428) -> 34.428/4 = 8.607\n   Hour 19: [8.239, 8.038, 8.640, 7.971] -> (8.239+8.038=16.277; 16.277+8.640=24.917; 24.917+7.971=32.888) -> 32.888/4 = 8.222\n   Hour 20: [7.435, 7.368, 7.703, 7.033] -> (7.435+7.368=14.803; 14.803+7.703=22.506; 22.506+7.033=29.539) -> 29.539/4 = 7.38475\n   Hour 21: [6.095, 6.564, 7.502, 6.363] -> (6.095+6.564=12.659; 12.659+7.502=20.161; 20.161+6.363=26.524) -> 26.524/4 = 6.631\n   Hour 22: [7.435, 7.301, 9.377, 8.573] -> (7.435+7.301=14.736; 14.736+9.377=24.113; 24.113+8.573=32.686) -> 32.686/4 = 8.1715\n   Hour 23: [8.439, 9.511, 12.726, 11.387] -> (8.439+9.511=17.95; 17.95+12.726=30.676; 30.676+11.387=42.063) -> 42.063/4 = 10.51575\n\n 35.
