        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates is complete.\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 3. Since the data shows a clear daily seasonality (with peaks and troughs at similar hours) and also some level of non-stationarity, \n    we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) for hourly data with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n - However, note that the data has only 4 days (96 hours) which is very limited for training a model with daily seasonality (only 4 cycles). \n   This might make the seasonal pattern estimation challenging.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can try:\n   - Using a simple seasonal naive model: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day (i.e., 2017-04-30).\n     But note: the pattern might change and we have 4 days of history. We might average the same hour over the last 4 days? \n     However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more robust method that can capture the trend and seasonality with limited data. \n One such method is the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with a seasonality of 24.\n\n Steps for Holt-Winters:\n   - We have three components: level, trend, and seasonal.\n   - We use the additive seasonality because the seasonal variations seem roughly constant over time.\n\n However, note that the data has a changing variance and the level is shifting. But with only 4 days, we must be cautious.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will use the following:\n\n   - We'll fit a Holt-Winters model with additive seasonality and a seasonal period of 24.\n\n But note: the data has a downward trend in the daily peaks? Let's observe:\n   - On 2017-04-27: max around 9.377 (at 23:00) and min around -15.271 (at 13:00)\n   - On 2017-04-28: max 11.253 (at 23:00) and min -16.946 (at 12:00)\n   - On 2017-04-29: max 9.377 (at 00:00) and min -17.549 (at 12:00)\n   - On 2017-04-30: max 8.372 (at 23:00) and min -15.271 (at 13:00)\n\n The pattern is not consistent. Therefore, we might also consider a model that uses the average of the last few days per hour.\n\n Since we are limited by the data, we can try:\n\n   Option 1: Seasonal Naive - use the last day (2017-04-30) as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n        But that would repeat the same day 4 times. However, the problem asks for 96 hours (4 days) so we can repeat the last day pattern 4 times? \n\n   Option 2: Average the same hour over the 4 available days and then use that average pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n   Option 3: Use a moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality? Not ideal.\n\n   Option 1 might be too simplistic and Option 2 might smooth out the pattern.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. \n We are only forecasting the next 96. We must be cautious.\n\n Given the ambiguity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we choose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a typical day, \n and then use that typical day repeated for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for Option 2:\n   - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days (2017-04-27 to 2017-04-30).\n   - Then, for the next 4 days (2017-05-01 to 2017-05-04), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n But note: the data shows a trend? The last day (2017-04-30) has lower values in the evening? \n   We might adjust by incorporating a trend. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to estimate a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? \n\n We decide to use a simple average per hour. \n\n How to compute:\n   - We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We group by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and average.\n\n Example for hour 00:00:\n    2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239\n    2017-04-28 00:00:00  11.588\n    2017-04-29 00:00:00  10.851\n    2017-04-30 00:00:00   9.377\n    Average = (8.239 + 11.588 + 10.851 + 9.377) / 4 = 10.01375\n\n We do this for each hour.\n\n Then, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this average day 4 times.\n\n The dates will be from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n\n However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 consecutive days (Thursday to Sunday). \n The next 4 days would be Monday to Thursday? But we don't have data for Monday? \n\n Since we don't have weekly data, we ignore weekly seasonality.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour of the day from the datetime index.\n   Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n   Step 3: Create a sequence of 4 repetitions of the 24-hour average pattern.\n\n But note: the provided data ends at 2017-04-30 23:00:00. The next hour is 2017-05-01 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2017-05-01 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n\n   For each hour in [0,1,...,23] for each of the 4 days, we assign the precomputed average for that hour.\n\n However, we must note that the average might not capture the trend. But given the data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (8.239 + 11.588 + 10.851 + 9.377) / 4 = 10.01375\n   Hour 1: (6.698 + 10.851 + 10.918 + 9.109) / 4 = 9.394\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll compute all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data has 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n However, the problem says the data has missing values, but we are not given any in the provided 96. \n We are only using the provided 96 to compute the average.\n\n We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: [8.239, 11.588, 10.851, 9.377] -> 10.01375 -> 10.014\n   Hour 1: [6.698, 10.851, 10.918, 9.109] -> (6.698+10.851+10.918+9.109)/4 = 37.576/4 = 9.394\n   Hour 2: [7.837, 10.918, 9.377, 9.109] -> (7.837+10.918+9.377+9.109)/4 = 37.241/4 = 9.31025 -> 9.310\n   Hour 3: [8.372, 10.717, 9.377, 8.975] -> (8.372+10.717+9.377+8.975)/4 = 37.441/4 = 9.36025 -> 9.360\n   Hour 4: [7.368, 11.186, 9.176, 9.377] -> (7.368+11.186+9.176+9.377)/4 = 37.107/4 = 9.27675 -> 9.277\n   Hour 5: [6.497, 10.918, 10.717, 10.449] -> (6.497+10.918+10.717+10.449)/4 = 38.581/4 = 9.64525 -> 9.645\n   Hour 6: [8.707, 12.190, 12.994, 11.788] -> (8.707+12.190+12.994+11.788)/4 = 45.679/4 = 11.41975 -> 11.420\n   Hour 7: [6.229, 6.162, 6.497, 5.961] -> (6.229+6.162+6.497+5.961)/4 = 24.849/4 = 6.21225 -> 6.212\n   Hour 8: [1.942, -1.340, 1.139, -0.670] -> (1.942 -1.340 + 1.139 -0.670)/4 = (1.942+1.139) + (-1.340-0.670) = 3.081 - 2.010 = 1.071/4 = 0.26775 -> 0.268\n   Hour 9: [-4.354, -7.033, -7.703, -5.626] -> (-4.354-7.033-7.703-5.626)/4 = -24.716/4 = -6.179\n   Hour 10: [-12.056, -10.784, -10.918, -8.707] -> (-12.056-10.784-10.918-8.707)/4 = -42.465/4 = -10.61625 -> -10.616\n   Hour 11: [-14.200, -12.860, -13.396, -10.516] -> (-14.200-12.860-13.396-10.516)/4 = -50.972/4 = -12.743\n   Hour 12: [-7.569, -16.946, -17.549, -13.597] -> (-7.569-16.946-17.549-13.597)/4 = -55.661/4 = -13.91525 -> -13.915\n   Hour 13: [-15.271, -15.472, -16.946, -14.669] -> (-15.271-15.472-16.946-14.669)/4 = -62.358/4 = -15.5895 -> -15.590\n   Hour 14: [-10.717, -13.798, -13.932, -15.271] -> (-10.717-13.798-13.932-15.271)/4 = -53.718/4 = -13.4295 -> -13.430\n   Hour 15: [-10.516, -10.583, -9.645, -11.721] -> (-10.516-10.583-9.645-11.721)/4 = -42.465/4 = -10.61625 -> -10.616\n   Hour 16: [-3.014, -4.756, -5.090, -7.234] -> (-3.014-4.756-5.090-7.234)/4 = -20.094/4 = -5.0235 -> -5.024\n   Hour 17: [3.550, 2.344, 2.545, 0.603] -> (3.550+2.344+2.545+0.603)/4 = 9.042/4 = 2.2605 -> 2.261\n   Hour 18: [6.899, 6.430, 6.497, 5.090] -> (6.899+6.430+6.497+5.090)/4 = 24.916/4 = 6.229\n   Hour 19: [7.837, 8.105, 7.569, 6.564] -> (7.837+8.105+7.569+6.564)/4 = 30.075/4 = 7.51875 -> 7.519\n   Hour 20: [8.038, 7.636, 7.234, 7.167] -> (8.038+7.636+7.234+7.167)/4 = 30.075/4? Let me recalc: 8.038+7.636=15.674, 7.234+7.167=14.401 -> 30.075 -> 30.075/4=7.51875 -> 7.519\n   Hour 21: [7.435, 8.372, 8.105, 6.296] -> (7.435+8.372+8.105+6.296)/4 = 30.208/4 = 7.552\n   Hour 22: [8.372, 7.904, 7.167, 5.425] -> (8.372+7.904+7.167+5.425)/4 = 28.868/4 = 7.217\n   Hour 23: [9.377, 11.253, 7.435, 8.372] -> (9.377+11.253+7.435+8.372)/4 = 36.437/4 = 9.10925 -> 9.109\n\n But wait, the last hour (23) of 2017-04-29 is 7.435? Actually, the data for 2017-04-29 23:00:00 is 7.435, and 2017-04-30 23:00:00 is 8.372.\n\n So the average for hour 23: (9.377 from 2017-04-27, 11.253 from 2017-04-28, 7.435 from 2017-04-29, 8.372 from 2017-04-30) = 36.437/4 = 9.109.\n\n Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the above 24 averages 4 times.\n\n The dates:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-01 23:00:00\n   Day 2: 2017-05-02 00:00:00 to 2017-05-02 23:00:00\n   Day 3: 2017-05-03 00:00:00 to 2017-05-03 23:00:00\n   Day 4: 2017-05-04 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00\n\n We'll assign:\n\n   2017-05-01 00:00:00: 10.014\n   2017-05-01 01:00:00: 9.394\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format as the input.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n We'll output the next 96 points in the format:\n\n        date, HUFL\n        2017-05-01 00:00:00, [value]\n        2017-05-01 01:00:00, [value]\n        ...\n\n We must output 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the averages:\n\n   hour0_avg = 10.014\n   hour1_avg = 9.394\n   hour2_avg = 9.310\n   hour3_avg = 9.360\n   hour4_avg = 9.277\n   hour5_avg = 9.645\n   hour6_avg = 11.420\n   hour7_avg = 6.212\n   hour8_avg = 0.268\n   hour9_avg = -6.179\n   hour10_avg = -10.616\n   hour11_avg = -12.743\n   hour12_avg = -13.915\n   hour13_avg = -15.590\n   hour14_avg = -13.430\n   hour15_avg = -10.616\n   hour16_avg = -5.024\n   hour17_avg = 2.261\n   hour18_avg = 6.229\n   hour19_avg = 7.519\n   hour20_avg = 7.519\n   hour21_avg = 7.552\n   hour22_avg = 7.217\n   hour23_avg = 9.109\n\n Then, for each day in the next 4 days, we assign the 24 values in order.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-04-30 23:00:00 is the last point. The next point is 2017-05-01 00:00:00.\n\n   We can use pandas date_range? But we are to output as string.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n      base_date = datetime(2017, 5, 1)\n      then for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n          for hour in range(0,24):\n              date = base_date + timedelta(days=day_offset) + timedelta(hours=hour)\n\n   But note: the input format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We'll write:\n\n      2017-05-01 00:00:00, 10.014\n      2017-05-01 01:00:00, 9.394\n      ... until\n      2017-05-01 23:00:00, 9.109\n\n      then\n      2017-05-02 00:00:00, 10.014\n      ... and so on.\n\n We must note: the averages are computed with 3 decimal places?

We can output as float with 3 decimals.\n\n We'll format the numbers to have 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the averages we computed are already rounded to 3 decimals? Actually, we rounded to 3 decimals by truncating? \n We should use rounding.\n\n Let me recalc with rounding:\n\n   We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Hour0: (8.239 + 11.588 + 10.851 + 9.377) / 4 = 40.055/4 = 10.01375 -> round to 3 decimals: 10.014\n   Hour1: (6.698+10.851+10.918+9.109) = 37.576 -> 37.576/4=9.394 -> 9.394\n   ... we did that.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n We'll write the data.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n We are not interpolating or filling missing in the input because the input is complete.\n\n We are only forecasting.\n\n We'll output the 96 lines.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-05-01 00:00:00\n   End: 2017-05-04 23:00:00\n\n We'll create a list of dates:\n\n   dates = []\n   for day in range(1,5): # 1,2,3,4\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date_str = f\"2017-05-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n But note: May has 31 days, so 01,02,03,04 are all valid.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   day 1: 2017-05-01\n   day 2: 2017-05-02\n   day 3: 2017-05-03\n   day 4: 2017-05-04\n\n And for each day, we assign the 24 average values in order.\n\n We'll write the output in the required format.\n\n But note: the problem says to output in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n We'll write:\n\n        date       HUFL\n        2017-05-01 00:00:00  10.014\n        ... (96 lines)\n\n We must not forget the header.\n\n However, the example input had:\n\n               date       HUFL\n\n We'll output the header as well? The problem says \"complete data\", and the example had the header.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning only the next 96 points? \n The example input had a header and then 96 rows. We are to output the next 96 rows? We should include the header? \n\n The problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and the example input had the header.\n\n But the example input was given as:\n\n               date       HUFL\n 2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\n\n So we output:\n\n        date       HUFL\n        2017-05-01 00:00:00  10.014\n        ...\n\n However, the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", so we are only outputting the next 96, not including the header? \n\n But the example input had the header. To be safe, we output the header and then the 96 rows.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might only want the 96 rows without the header? \n\n Since the problem says \"the complete data\", and the example input had the header, we include the header.\n\n But note: the example output format in the problem statement does not show the header? \n\n The problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\"\n\n And the example input they gave had the header? But they are giving the input, and we are to output the forecast.\n\n We are to output the forecast in the same format? \n\n The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n So we are to output a table with two columns: date and HUFL, and 96 rows? \n\n We'll include the header to be clear.\n\n We'll write:\n\n        date       HUFL\n        2017-05-01 00:00:00  10.014\n        ...\n\n But note: the example input had the HUFL values with 6 decimal places? But they were integers? Actually, they had 3 decimal places and then three zeros? \n\n We can output with 3 decimal places and then three zeros? Or just 3 decimal places? \n\n The example input:\n\n        8.239000\n\n We can output as 10.014000? But that would be 6 decimals. \n\n Alternatively, we can output as 10.014 and it will be the same? \n\n But the problem says: \"You mustn't omit any content.\" \n\n The input had 6 decimals? So we output 6 decimals? \n\n We can do:\n\n        format the number to have 6 decimal places: \"{:.6f}\".format(x)\n\n But our numbers are rounded to 3 decimals? We can output 10.014000, 9.394000, etc.\n\n Let me check: \n\n   We computed 10.01375 -> rounded to 3 decimals is 10.014, then we output 10.014000.\n\n   Similarly, 9.394 -> 9.394000.\n\n So we'll format each number to have 6 decimal places.\n\n Steps:\n\n   For each value, we do: formatted_value = \"{:.6f}\".format(value)\n\n   But note: negative numbers? They will be formatted correctly.\n\n Example: -6.179 -> \"-6.179000\"\n\n We'll do that.\n\n Now, we generate the output.\n\n We have:\n\n   header: \"date       HUFL\"\n\n   then 96 rows: each row is the date string and the formatted_value.\n\n   We'll align the columns? The input had the dates aligned and the numbers aligned? \n\n   We can use:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\"\n\n   But the input had the date string and then the number with a space? and the numbers were aligned to the right.\n\n   We can pad the number to have 10 characters? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output as:\n\n        \"2017-05-01 00:00:00  10.014000\"\n\n   The input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   So the numbers were aligned to the right with a space? \n\n   We can do: \n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value:>10}\"\n\n   But the input had the number starting at the same column? \n\n   Actually, the input had:\n\n        date       HUFL\n        2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\n\n   The date string is 19 characters? and then two spaces? and then the number.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\"\n\n   But to match the alignment, we can use:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}   {formatted_value}\"\n\n   But the input had two spaces? Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   There are two spaces between the time and the number? \n\n   Actually, the date string is \"2017-04-27 00:00:00\" (19 characters) and then two spaces? \n\n   We'll output:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\"\n\n   This will give: \"2017-05-01 00:00:00 10.014000\"\n\n   But the example had: \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\" -> note: two spaces after the time? \n\n   Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   There are two spaces? Actually, in the string: \n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00\" (19 characters) and then two spaces? \n\n   then the number? \n\n   We'll output: \n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\"\n\n   That gives one space? \n\n   We can output two spaces: \n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> but that's one space? \n\n   Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   There are two spaces? \n\n   Let me count: \n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00\" -> 19 characters.\n\n        then two spaces? \n\n        then the number.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> this is one space? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}   {formatted_value}\" -> two spaces? \n\n   But the example input had two spaces? \n\n   Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   It has two spaces? \n\n   We'll output two spaces between the date string and the number.\n\n   So:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> this is one space? \n\n   Actually, in Python, if we write:\n\n        s = \"a\" + \" \" + \"b\" -> that's one space.\n\n        s = \"a  b\" -> that's two spaces.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> that's two characters of space? \n\n   Actually, no: the string is: date_str + \" \" + formatted_value -> that's one space.\n\n   We want two? Then:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}   {formatted_value}\" -> that's two spaces? \n\n   Actually, that's two spaces: because the first space is the one after the second space is the one in the beginning of the formatted_value? \n\n   We want: \n\n        \"2017-05-01 00:00:00  10.014000\" -> that's one space? \n\n   Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   There are two spaces? \n\n   Let me count: \n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00\" -> 19 characters.\n\n        then two spaces: so 19 to 21 are spaces.\n\n        then the number starts at 21.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> this will be 19 (date) + 1 (space) + len(formatted_value) \n\n   But the example input had two spaces? \n\n   Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   It has two spaces? \n\n   We'll output two spaces: \n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> this is one space? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}   {formatted_value}\" -> two spaces? \n\n   But that would be: \n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00  8.014000\" -> that's two spaces? \n\n   Actually, that's two spaces? \n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00\" (19) + \"  \" (2) + \"8.014000\" -> total 19+2+9 = 30.\n\n   The example input had 19 + 2 + 9 = 30.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> that's one space -> 19+1+9=29.\n\n   We want 30? \n\n   Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\"\n\n   There are two spaces? \n\n   We'll output two spaces: \n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\"\n\n   But that's one space? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}   {formatted_value}\" -> that's two spaces? \n\n   Actually, that's two spaces: because the first space is the one we added, and the second is the one in the string? \n\n   Let me test:\n\n        date_str = \"2017-05-01 00:00:00\"\n        formatted_value = \"10.014000\"\n\n        row = date_str + \"  \" + formatted_value -> \"2017-05-01 00:00:00  10.014000\"\n\n   That has two spaces? \n\n   So we do: \n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\"\n\n   But that is one space? \n\n   Actually, we are using two: \n\n        \"  \" -> two spaces.\n\n   So:\n\n        row = f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" -> this is two spaces? \n\n   But in the format string, we are putting two spaces? \n\n   Actually, the format string: \n\n        f\"{date_str}  {formatted_value}\" \n\n   has two spaces between the two expressions? \n\n   But that is the literal: two space characters.\n\n   So we are good.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        for each row: \n            date_str = \"2017-05-01 00:00:00\" (for example)\n            value = 10.014 -> formatted to \"10.014000\"\n            row = date_str + \"  \" + formatted_value\n\n   And the header: \"date       HUFL\" -> we can output as:\n\n        \"date       HUFL\"\n\n   How many spaces in the header? \n\n        \"date\" (4) then 7 spaces? then \"HUFL\" (4) -> total 4+7+4=15? \n\n   But the data rows are 19 (date) + 2 (spaces) + 9 (number) = 30.\n\n   The header: \n\n        \"date       HUFL\" -> we want to align? \n\n   We can output:\n\n        \"date                 HUFL\"\n\n   to have the HUFL aligned with the numbers? \n\n   The example input had:\n\n               date       HUFL\n        2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\n\n   The header \"date\" is aligned to the left of the date string? and \"HUFL\" is aligned to the number? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        header = \"date                 HUFL\"\n\n   But the date string is 19 characters, so we want to put the \"date\" at the beginning and then 15 spaces? and then \"HUFL\" at the position of the numbers? \n\n   Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"               date       HUFL\"\n\n   That was because of the index? \n\n   We are not outputting the index? \n\n   The problem says: \"complete data\", and the example input had an index? \n\n   But the example input was given as:\n\n               date       HUFL\n        2017-04-27 00:00:00   8.239000\n\n   The index was the row number? \n\n   We are not including the index? \n\n   We'll output without index.\n\n   So the header: \n\n        \"date       HUFL\" -> but we don't have the index.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        header = \"date       HUFL\"\n\n   and then the rows without any index.\n\n   But the example input had the index? \n\n   The problem says: \"You must provide the complete data.\" \n\n   We are providing the data without index? \n\n   The example input had the index? \n\n   Actually, the example input was printed from a DataFrame with index? \n\n   We are to output the data in the index? \n\n   The problem does not specify. \n\n   We'll output without index.\n\n   The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n   and the example input had the index? \n\n   But the problem did not say to include the index.\n\n   We'll output without index.\n\n   So:\n\n        header: \"date       HUFL\"\n        then rows: \"2017-05-01 00:00:00  10.014000\"\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Now, we write the code to generate the dates and the values.\n\n   We have the 24 average values in a list:\n\n        averages = [\n            10.014, 9.394, 9.310, 9.360, 9.277, 9.645, 11.420, 6.212, 0.268, -6.179, -10.616, -12.743, \n            -13.915, -15.590, -13.430, -10.616, -5.024, 2.261, 6.229, 7.519, 7.519, 7.552, 7.217, 9.109\n        ]\n\n   Then, for day in range(4): # 0,1,2,3 -> 4 days\n        for hour in range(24):\n            day_str = f\"2017-05-{day+1:02d}\"   # day+1: 1,2,3,4\n            hour_str = f\"{hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            date_str = f\"{day_str} {hour_str}\"\n            value = averages[hour]\n            # format value to 6 decimal places\n            value_str = f\"{value:.6f}\"\n\n            # if value is integer? but we have floats, so we do as above.\n\n   Then write the row: date_str + \"  \" + value_str\n\n   But note: the averages we computed are rounded to 3 decimals?
