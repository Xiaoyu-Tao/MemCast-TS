        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and shows a daily pattern (with higher values at night and lower during the day).\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, the problem says the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. \n    Since we are only given 96 points without any explicit missing values, we assume the provided data is complete for the purpose of modeling. But for forecasting, we need to handle any potential missing values in the future? \n    However, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But note: the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96. \n    The instruction is to provide the complete data for the next 96, meaning we must fill in any missing values? But the problem does not specify that the future data has missing values. \n    Actually, we are to forecast 96 points. We are to output 96 points without any missing values? \n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 points. We can use a time series method that can handle the seasonality. Since the data has a clear daily pattern (24 hours), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal naive method, but that might not capture trends.\n - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or a seasonal ARIMA model.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history. \n\n Let's observe the pattern:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-09-23): \n        Night: around 8-9, then drops to around 5-6 during the day, then rises again at night.\n\n   Day 2 (2016-09-24): \n        Similar pattern: starts around 10, then drops to around 5-6 during the day, then rises at night.\n\n   Day 3 (2016-09-25): \n        Similar: starts around 11.9, then drops to around 4-6 during the day, then rises at night.\n\n   Day 4 (2016-09-26): \n        Starts around 9.8, then drops to around 4-6 during the day, then rises at night.\n\n The pattern is consistent: high at night (especially around 00:00-03:00) and then drops during the day (09:00-18:00) and then rises again in the evening.\n\n However, the level of the night peaks varies: 9.8, 10.092, 11.904, 9.879? and the day minimums also vary: around 3.5 to 5.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, it's hard to see a weekly pattern. We are forecasting the next 4 days (from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00).\n\n Given the short history, we can use a simple method: \n   - Use the average of the same hour of the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not told which ones are missing. However, in the provided data there are none. \n For the forecast, we are to produce 96 points without missing values.\n\n Let me propose:\n\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 available days and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n However, we note that the pattern might be changing. But with only 4 days, we don't have much to go on.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n   Let H0, H1, ... H23 be the 24 hours.\n\n   For the next 4 days, for hour h (where h from 0 to 23 repeated 4 times):\n\n        forecast = (value of h on day1 + value of h on day2 + value of h on day3 + value of h on day4) / 4\n\n   But note: the last day in the history is 2016-09-26. The next day is 2016-09-27, then 28, 29, 30.\n\n Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n\n        Day1 (23rd): 8.742\n        Day2 (24th): 10.092\n        Day3 (25th): 11.904\n        Day4 (26th): 9.879\n\n        Average = (8.742 + 10.092 + 11.904 + 9.879) / 4 = 40.617 / 4 = 10.15425\n\n   So for 2016-09-27 00:00:00: 10.15425\n\n   Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n\n        Day1: 8.671\n        Day2: 9.701\n        Day3: 11.762\n        Day4: 9.204\n\n        Average = (8.671+9.701+11.762+9.204)/4 = 39.338/4 = 9.8345\n\n   And so on.\n\n This method is simple and uses the seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided history we don't have any. \n If in the future we were to have missing values, we would have to impute. But here we are only forecasting.\n\n But the problem says \"be aware of that\" - meaning we should be cautious? However, we are only given the history without missing values. \n\n Since the history is complete, we can use the above method.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a more sophisticated model, but with only 4 days, it's hard. \n\n Let's try to see if there's a trend? \n\n   The night peaks: \n        23rd: 9.808 (at 23:00) and 8.742 (at 00:00) -> but note 00:00 is the start of the day, so the peak on 23rd night is 9.808 and then 8.742 at the next day's 00:00? \n        Actually, the data for 23rd: \n            23:00: 9.808\n        Then 24th 00:00: 10.092 -> so the peak on the night of 23rd-24th is 10.092 at 00:00? \n\n   We can look at the maximum of each day:\n\n        Day1 (23rd): max at 23:00 -> 9.808\n        Day2 (24th): max at 00:00 -> 10.092, then 10.838 at 05:00? Actually, 10.838 at 05:00? Let me check:\n\n            2016-09-24 00:00:00 10.092\n            01:00:00  9.701\n            02:00:00 10.234\n            03:00:00 10.732\n            04:00:00  9.026\n            05:00:00 10.838 -> so the max on 24th is 10.838 at 05:00? and 10.732 at 03:00? -> actually 10.838 is the highest.\n\n        Day3 (25th): \n            00:00: 11.904 -> then 11.762, 10.909, 10.625, 10.838 at 04:00? -> actually 11.904 is the max.\n\n        Day4 (26th):\n            00:00: 9.879, then 9.204, 8.564, 9.204, 9.594, 10.234 -> max at 23:00: 11.798.\n\n   So the max values: 9.808, 10.838, 11.904, 11.798 -> increasing then a slight drop? \n\n   But we don't sure about the trend with only 4 points.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average for the same hour to smooth and then use that.\n\n   Since the history is short, we stick to the average per hour.\n\n   We'll compute the average_hour = [ average for hour0, hour1, ... hour23 ]\n\n Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n   Day1 (2016-09-27): \n        hour0: average_hour[0]\n        hour1: average_hour[1]\n        ...\n        hour23: average_hour[23]\n\n   Day2 (2016-09-28): same as above\n   Day3 (2016-09-29): same\n   Day4 (2016-09-30): same\n\n But note: the problem says the data is recorded either hourly or every 15 minutes. In this case, we have hourly data.\n\n However, the next 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the 4 days of data and group by hour of the day.\n\n   We have 4 days, each day has 24 hours.\n\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n   Step 3: Repeat the 24-hour average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   Step 4: Format the dates: starting from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 5: Output the 96 points.\n\n Let's code this:\n\n   First, parse the given data. We are given 96 rows.\n\n   We can split the data into 4 chunks of 24.\n\n   But note: the first day is 2016-09-23 (Friday) and then 24 (Saturday), 25 (Sunday), 26 (Monday). \n   The next four days: 27 (Tuesday), 28 (Wednesday), 29 (Thursday), 30 (Friday).\n\n   We are not accounting for weekly seasonality because we only have 4 days and they are not a full week? \n   But we don't have a choice with the data we have.\n\n   We'll proceed with the average per hour.\n\n   Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (8.742, 10.092, 11.904, 9.879) -> (8.742+10.092+11.904+9.879)/4 = 40.617/4 = 10.15425\n        hour1: (8.671, 9.701, 11.762, 9.204) -> 39.338/4 = 9.8345\n        hour2: (7.071, 10.234, 10.909, 8.564) -> 36.778/4 = 9.1945\n        hour3: (8.706, 10.732, 10.625, 9.204) -> 39.267/4 = 9.81675\n        hour4: (7.924, 9.026, 10.838, 9.594) -> 37.382/4 = 9.3455\n        hour5: (8.813, 10.838, 10.625, 10.234) -> 40.51/4 = 10.1275\n        hour6: (8.102, 9.914, 11.122, 10.092) -> 39.23/4 = 9.8075\n        hour7: (7.747, 11.478, 10.625, 8.173) -> 38.023/4 = 9.50575\n        hour8: (6.929, 10.625, 8.386, 6.361) -> 32.301/4 = 8.07525\n        hour9: (5.259, 5.224, 6.325, 5.828) -> 22.636/4 = 5.659\n        hour10: (6.148, 5.863, 5.970, 6.219) -> 24.2/4 = 6.05\n        hour11: (5.472, 5.863, 5.970, 6.610) -> 23.915/4 = 5.97875\n        hour12: (3.482, 3.838, 4.122, 4.406) -> 15.848/4 = 3.962\n        hour13: (4.193, 4.442, 4.051, 4.015) -> 16.701/4 = 4.17525\n        hour14: (4.548, 4.655, 4.655, 5.366) -> 19.224/4 = 4.806\n        hour15: (4.335, 4.726, 4.904, 4.797) -> 18.762/4 = 4.6905\n        hour16: (4.477, 5.082, 4.868, 4.548) -> 18.975/4 = 4.74375\n        hour17: (4.797, 5.828, 4.975, 4.904) -> 20.504/4 = 5.126\n        hour18: (4.442, 4.229, 4.264, 4.158) -> 17.093/4 = 4.27325\n        hour19: (4.584, 4.335, 4.513, 4.335) -> 17.767/4 = 4.44175\n        hour20: (4.087, 4.513, 4.513, 4.371) -> 17.484/4 = 4.371\n        hour21: (5.650, 6.290, 4.087, 5.757) -> 21.784/4 = 5.446\n        hour22: (7.285, 7.640, 6.645, 7.143) -> 28.713/4 = 7.17825\n        hour23: (9.808, 8.564, 9.204, 11.798) -> 39.374/4 = 9.8435\n\n   Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-27: \n            00:00:00 -> 10.15425\n            01:00:00 -> 9.8345\n            02:00:00 -> 9.1945\n            03:00:00 -> 9.81675\n            04:00:00 -> 9.3455\n            05:00:00 -> 10.1275\n            06:00:00 -> 9.8075\n            07:00:00 -> 9.50575\n            08:00:00 -> 8.07525\n            09:00:00 -> 5.659\n            10:00:00 -> 6.05\n            11:00:00 -> 5.97875\n            12:00:00 -> 3.962\n            13:00:00 -> 4.17525\n            14:00:00 -> 4.806\n            15:00:00 -> 4.6905\n            16:00:00 -> 4.74375\n            17:00:00 -> 5.126\n            18:00:00 -> 4.27325\n            19:00:00 -> 4.44175\n            20:00:00 -> 4.371\n            21:00:00 -> 5.446\n            22:00:00 -> 7.17825\n            23:00:00 -> 9.8435\n\n        Day2: 2016-09-28: same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2016-09-29: same\n        Day4: 2016-09-30: same\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n   So we'll round each forecast to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Example: 10.15425 -> 10.154\n\n   But note: the input had values like 8.742, 8.671, etc. So we output with 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, let me check: 10.15425 rounded to 3 decimals: \n        10.154 -> because the 4th decimal is 2, so we don't round up.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the exact same representation.\n\n   We'll format each number to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Now, generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-27 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-09-27 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-30 23:00:00.\n\n   We can use pandas to generate the date range? But we are not using code, we are writing the output.\n\n   We'll write 96 lines.\n\n   Format:\n\n        date and time in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n   The next day after 2016-09-26 is 2016-09-27.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        2016-09-27 00:00:00  <value>\n        2016-09-27 01:00:00  <value>\n        ...\n        2016-09-27 23:00:00  <value>\n        2016-09-28 00:00:00  <value>\n        ... until 2016-09-30 23:00:00\n\n   We have 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n   We'll use the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n   Let me list the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n        hour0: 10.154\n        hour1: 9.835   (because 9.8345 -> 9.835? Let me round: 9.8345 -> 9.834 or 9.835? \n                The rule: 5 or above rounds up. 9.8345: the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal 4 to 5 -> 9.835)\n\n        But note: the input had 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n            hour0: 10.15425 -> 10.154\n            hour1: 9.8345 -> 9.834 (because 4th decimal is 5, but wait: 9.8345: \n                    the 4th decimal is 5, and the 3rd is 4 -> we round to even? or standard rounding: round half up? \n                    We'll use round half up: 9.8345 -> 9.835)\n\n        Actually, in the input, we see numbers like 8.742, 8.671, etc. They are given to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimals using the standard rule: round half up.\n\n        So:\n\n            hour0: 10.15425 -> 10.154 (because 2 is less than 5, so we leave 154 -> 10.154)\n            hour1: 9.8345 -> 9.835 (because the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal: 4 becomes 5 -> 9.835)\n\n        Let me do all:\n\n            hour0: 10.15425 -> 10.154\n            hour1: 9.8345 -> 9.835\n            hour2: 9.1945 -> 9.195\n            hour3: 9.81675 -> 9.817\n            hour4: 9.3455 -> 9.346\n            hour5: 10.1275 -> 10.128\n            hour6: 9.8075 -> 9.808\n            hour7: 9.50575 -> 9.506\n            hour8: 8.07525 -> 8.075\n            hour9: 5.659 -> 5.659\n            hour10: 6.05 -> 6.050 (but we can write 6.05? but the input we have 6.148, 5.863 -> so they have 3 decimals. So we write 6.050)\n            Actually, we should output 3 decimal places. So 6.05 becomes 6.050? \n            But in the input, they don't have trailing zeros? \n            Example: 5.259, 6.148 -> so we output without trailing zeros? \n            But 5.259 has 3, 6.148 has 3. So we output 3 decimals.\n\n            We can format to 3 decimal places: \n                if the number has less than 3 decimals, we pad with zeros? \n            But the input: \n                8.742 -> 3 decimals\n                8.671 -> 3\n                7.071 -> 3\n                8.706 -> 3\n                7.924 -> 3\n                8.813 -> 3\n                8.102 -> 3\n                7.747 -> 3\n                6.929 -> 3\n                5.259 -> 3\n                6.148 -> 3\n                5.472 -> 3\n                3.482 -> 3\n                4.193 -> 3\n                4.548 -> 3\n                4.335 -> 3\n                4.477 -> 3\n                4.797 -> 3\n                4.442 -> 3\n                4.584 -> 3\n                4.087 -> 3\n                5.650 -> 3\n                7.285 -> 3\n                9.808 -> 3\n\n            So we output 3 decimal places.
