        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also might have weekly patterns (but we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern might not be captured well).\n\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we assume that the missing values are in the future? \n    But the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". It might be a warning that the provided data could have missing values, but in this case, we have complete data for the past 96.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We are required to output the complete data (both date and MUFL) for the next 96 hours.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since we have hourly data and a clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 4 days), we might use a very complex model? Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive model, but that might not capture trends.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or a seasonal decomposition model.\n\n 7. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So for forecasting, we can use the complete past.\n\n 8. We choose to use a model that can capture seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we can use a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 9. We can use the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and then forecast the seasonally adjusted series and then add back the seasonality.\n\n 10. But note: we are only required to forecast 96 steps (4 days) and we have 4 days of history. \n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? \n\n    For example, for 00:00, we have 4 values: \n        2016-11-10 00:00:00 -> 11.442\n        2016-11-11 00:00:00 -> 10.661\n        2016-11-12 00:00:00 -> 7.747\n        2016-11-13 00:00:00 -> 8.777\n\n    Then the forecast for 2016-11-14 00:00:00 could be the average of these: (11.442+10.661+7.747+8.777)/4 = 9.65675\n\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n 12. However, we note that there might be a trend? Looking at the data, the values at 00:00 are decreasing? \n        Day1: 11.442, Day2: 10.661, Day3: 7.747, Day4: 8.777 -> not a clear trend.\n\n 13. We can also consider using the last available season as the forecast? (i.e., using the same day of the previous week? but we don't have a week). \n        Since we only have 4 days, we can use the average of the last two days? or the last three? \n\n 14. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we will use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days.\n\n 15. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. Since the provided data is complete, we assume that the missing values are in the future? \n        But we are forecasting the future. We are required to output the complete data for the next 96. So we will forecast without missing values.\n\n 16. However, if in the future there are missing values, we cannot know. We are only to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 17. We decide to use the average by hour of the four days for the forecast.\n\n 18. Steps for each hour in the day (0 to 23):\n        Let h be the hour (0 for 00:00, 1 for 01:00, ... 23 for 23:00)\n        We have 4 values for each hour: from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n        We compute the average for that hour.\n\n 19. Then for the next 4 days (2016-11-14 to 2016-11-17), we assign the average for the corresponding hour.\n\n 20. But note: the last date in the data is 2016-11-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours will be:\n\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-14 23:00:00 -> day 5 (Monday? but we don't have day of week in data, and we are not using weekly seasonality)\n        2016-11-15 00:00:00 to 2016-11-15 23:00:00 -> day 6\n        2016-11-16 00:00:00 to 2016-11-16 23:00:00 -> day 7\n        2016-11-17 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00 -> day 8\n\n    However, we are only using daily seasonality. So we will use the same 24-hour pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 21. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (11.442 + 10.661 + 7.747 + 8.777) / 4 = 9.65675\n        hour1: (10.589 + 11.371 + 9.097 + 9.026) / 4 = 10.02075\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. However, we must be cautious: the data has a pattern that might change? But with only 4 days, we cannot capture weekly effects (like weekend vs weekday). \n        Since we don't have the day of the week, and the data is from 2016-11-10 (Thursday) to 2016-11-13 (Sunday), the next 4 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? \n        Actually: \n          2016-11-10: Thursday\n          2016-11-11: Friday\n          2016-11-12: Saturday\n          2016-11-13: Sunday\n          Then 2016-11-14: Monday, 2016-11-15: Tuesday, 2016-11-16: Wednesday, 2016-11-17: Thursday.\n\n        So the next Monday might be different from the weekend? But we don't have a Monday in the history. \n\n 23. Given the lack of data, we stick to the average of the four days.\n\n 24. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 25. Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating the same 24-hour average for 4 days.\n\n 26. But note: the average pattern might be a good baseline.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model? But with only 96 points and the need for 96-step forecast, and without more context, the average by hour is a reasonable approach.\n\n 28. We will compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n 29. How to compute: We have 4 days, each day has 24 hours -> 96 points.\n\n        We group by hour (the time of day: 0,1,...,23) and take the mean.\n\n 30. Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n        Day 5 (2016-11-14): hour0: avg0, ... hour23: avg23\n        Day 6 (2016-11-15): hour0: avg0, ... hour23: avg23\n        Day 7 (2016-11-16): hour0: avg0, ... hour23: avg23\n        Day 8 (2016-11-17): hour0: avg0, ... hour23: avg23\n\n 31. We generate the dates: starting from 2016-11-14 00:00:00, then 2016-11-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MUFL'\n\n 33. We round the MUFL to 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [11.442, 10.661, 7.747, 8.777] -> mean = (11.442+10.661+7.747+8.777)/4 = 9.65675 -> 9.657\n        hour1: [10.589, 11.371, 9.097, 9.026] -> (10.589+11.371+9.097+9.026)/4 = 10.02075 -> 10.021\n        ... \n\n 35. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 36. We write a small code (or do it manually? but 24 is manageable) but we are an AI so we can compute.\n\n 37. Alternatively, we can write a loop in our mind.\n\n 38. We create a list for each hour index (0-23) and collect the values.\n\n 39. Then compute the mean for each.\n\n 40. Then assign for the next 4 days.\n\n 41. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-14 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-11-17 23:00:00\n\n        This is 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n 42. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00, [avg0]\n        2016-11-14 01:00:00, [avg1]\n        ...\n        2016-11-17 23:00:00, [avg23]\n\n 43. We must note: the average for hour0 is the same for 2016-11-14 00:00:00, 2016-11-15 00:00:00, etc.\n\n 44. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: (11.442, 10.661, 7.747, 8.777) -> 9.65675 -> 9.657\n        hour1: (10.589, 11.371, 9.097, 9.026) -> 10.02075 -> 10.021\n        hour2: (10.838, 10.661, 9.168, 8.031) -> (10.838+10.661+9.168+8.031)/4 = 9.6745 -> 9.675\n        hour3: (9.701, 11.371, 9.204, 8.777) -> (9.701+11.371+9.204+8.777)/4 = 9.76325 -> 9.763\n        hour4: (10.092, 10.874, 10.021, 7.818) -> (10.092+10.874+10.021+7.818)/4 = 9.70125 -> 9.701\n        hour5: (9.701, 10.696, 9.204, 7.107) -> (9.701+10.696+9.204+7.107)/4 = 9.177 -> 9.177\n        hour6: (11.336, 9.879, 8.564, 7.285) -> (11.336+9.879+8.564+7.285)/4 = 9.266 -> 9.266\n        hour7: (10.803, 11.300, 9.275, 7.676) -> (10.803+11.300+9.275+7.676)/4 = 9.7635 -> 9.764\n        hour8: (8.493, 7.320, 6.076, 5.366) -> (8.493+7.320+6.076+5.366)/4 = 6.81375 -> 6.814\n        hour9: (7.071, 5.863, 5.543, 5.046) -> (7.071+5.863+5.543+5.046)/4 = 5.88075 -> 5.881\n        hour10: (5.899, 5.579, 5.757, 6.076) -> (5.899+5.579+5.757+6.076)/4 = 5.82775 -> 5.828\n        hour11: (6.325, 5.934, 6.076, 5.970) -> (6.325+5.934+6.076+5.970)/4 = 6.07625 -> 6.076\n        hour12: (4.015, 4.300, 4.513, 4.797) -> (4.015+4.300+4.513+4.797)/4 = 4.40625 -> 4.406\n        hour13: (5.579, 4.122, 4.868, 4.371) -> (5.579+4.122+4.868+4.371)/4 = 4.735 -> 4.735\n        hour14: (5.792, 4.833, 4.406, 4.335) -> (5.792+4.833+4.406+4.335)/4 = 4.8415 -> 4.842\n        hour15: (4.726, 4.442, 5.046, 4.087) -> (4.726+4.442+5.046+4.087)/4 = 4.57525 -> 4.575\n        hour16: (4.691, 4.193, 4.620, 4.513) -> (4.691+4.193+4.620+4.513)/4 = 4.50425 -> 4.504\n        hour17: (5.757, 5.366, 5.508, 5.366) -> (5.757+5.366+5.508+5.366)/4 = 5.49925 -> 5.499\n        hour18: (5.472, 5.082, 4.726, 4.975) -> (5.472+5.082+4.726+4.975)/4 = 5.06375 -> 5.064\n        hour19: (4.797, 5.117, 4.868, 4.762) -> (4.797+5.117+4.868+4.762)/4 = 4.886 -> 4.886\n        hour20: (4.406, 4.620, 4.264, 4.300) -> (4.406+4.620+4.264+4.300)/4 = 4.3975 -> 4.398\n        hour21: (4.264, 3.838, 3.696, 3.909) -> (4.264+3.838+3.696+3.909)/4 = 3.92675 -> 3.927\n        hour22: (6.183, 6.432, 4.122, 5.934) -> (6.183+6.432+4.122+5.934)/4 = 5.66775 -> 5.668\n        hour23: (8.493, 8.990, 7.107, 7.285) -> (8.493+8.990+7.107+7.285)/4 = 7.96875 -> 7.969\n\n 45. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-14: \n            00:00:00 -> 9.657\n            01:00:00 -> 10.021\n            02:00:00 -> 9.675\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 7.969\n\n        Day2: 2016-11-15: same pattern\n        Day3: 2016-11-16: same pattern\n        Day4: 2016-11-17: same pattern\n\n 46. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 47. Note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 48. We output the data as:\n\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00,9.657\n        2016-11-14 01:00:00,10.021\n        ...\n\n 49. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 50. We do not omit any content.\n\n 51. We put the answer in the <answer> tag.\n\n 52. We note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output all 96.\n\n 53. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-14 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n\n 54. We create a list:\n\n        dates = []\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 14, 11) -> but wait, the last date in the input is 2016-11-13, so next is 2016-11-14.\n\n        We can generate:\n\n            base_date = datetime(2016, 11, 14)\n            for day in range(4):\n                for hour in range(24):\n                    date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n\n        But note: we are adding both day and hour? Actually, we can do:\n\n            for i in range(96):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n 55. We'll generate:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2016, 11,14) -> but wait, the month is 11 (November) and day 14.\n\n        Actually: \n            year=2016, month=11, day=14\n\n 56. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 57. However, we are not coding but we can generate the dates in the answer.\n\n 58. We list:\n\n        Line 1: 2016-11-14 00:00:00, 9.657\n        Line 2: 2016-11-14 01:00:00, 10.021\n        ...\n        Line 25: 2016-11-14 23:00:00, 7.969\n        Line 26: 2016-11-15 00:00:00, 9.657\n        ... and so on.\n\n 59. We output the data in the same order.\n\n 60. We are ready to write the answer.\n\n 61. We note: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 time points.\n\n 62. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00,9.657\n        2016-11-14 01:00:00,10.021\n        2016-11-14 02:00:00,9.675\n        2016-11-14 03:00:00,9.763\n        2016-11-14 04:00:00,9.701\n        2016-11-14 05:00:00,9.177\n        2016-11-14 06:00:00,9.266\n        2016-11-14 07:00:00,9.764\n        2016-11-14 08:00:00,6.814\n        2016-11-14 09:00:00,5.881\n        2016-11-14 10:00:00,5.828\n        2016-11-14 11:00:00,6.076\n        2016-11-14 12:00:00,4.406\n        2016-11-14 13:00:00,4.735\n        2016-11-14 14:00:00,4.842\n        2016-11-14 15:00:00,4.575\n        2016-11-14 16:00:00,4.504\n        2016-11-14 17:00:00,5.499\n        2016-11-14 18:00:00,5.064\n        2016-11-14 19:00:00,4.886\n        2016-11-14 20:00:00,4.398\n        2016-11-14 21:00:00,3.927\n        2016-11-14 22:00:00,5.668\n        2016-11-14 23:00:00,7.969\n        2016-11-15 00:00:00,9.657\n        2016-11-15 01:00:00,10.021\n        ... (repeat the same 24 values for the next day)\n        ... until 2016-11-17 23:00:00,7.969\n\n 63. We note: the last day (2016-11-17) will have the same pattern.\n\n 64. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 65. We must be cautious: the averages we computed are for the 24 hours, and we repeat them 4 times.\n\n 66. We output the data in the same format as the input (with the date string and the MUFL value with 3 decimal places).\n\n 67. We write the answer in the required XML-like tag.\n\n 68. We note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\".\n\n 69. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 70. We do not include the header (like 'date', 'MUFL')? The example input had a header, but the problem says \"complete data\" and the example output format does not specify.\n\n 71. The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the example input had:\n\n               date   MUFL\n        2016-11-10 00:00:00 11.442\n\n    But in the output, we are to provide the data in the same format? However, the instruction says: \"the complete data\", meaning the two columns.\n\n 72. We output without the header? The example input had the header, but the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then we are to forecast.\n\n    The example input had:\n\n        date   MUFL\n        2016-11-10 00:00:00 11.442\n\n    But the output should be just the data? The problem says \"complete data\", so we output the two columns without the header.\n\n 73. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00 9.657\n        2016-11-14 01:00:00 10.021\n        ...\n\n 74. But note: the input had the MUFL values aligned? We can use the same spacing? But the problem does not require specific alignment.\n\n 75. We output: date string and then space and then the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n 76. We write the answer.\n\n 77. However, note: the input had the date and time as a single string and then the MUFL value. We do the same.\n\n 78. We generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 79. We note: the averages we computed and rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 80. We output.\n",
