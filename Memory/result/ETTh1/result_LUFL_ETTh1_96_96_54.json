        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low Useful Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The data spans from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern).\n 2. We are to handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method that can capture seasonality. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96 forecasts, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive method: using the last available season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, repeated for 4 days (96 hours).\n    - However, note that the pattern might change slightly, but without more data, we rely on the most recent cycle.\n\n But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days. We don't have a full week. So we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality) or SARIMA. However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA model might be overkill and we don't have enough data for seasonal differencing (with seasonality 24) and non-seasonal differencing.\n\n Given the problem constraints, we can use the following approach:\n\n Approach 1: Use the average of each hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n  The data from 2017-02-02 to 2017-02-05: \n    We see that the daily pattern is similar but the levels might be slightly different.\n\n Approach 2: We can use the last day (2017-02-05) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But we only have 3 transitions.\n\n However, note the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we are to forecast the next 96 points without missing values? But the forecast must be complete.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to be practical, we choose:\n\n  - We observe that the pattern repeats daily, but the magnitude might be changing. However, the last day (2017-02-05) is the most recent and might be the most relevant.\n\n  - We will use the last 24 hours (2017-02-05 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00) and repeat it 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n  Why not the average? Because the last day might be the most representative for the immediate future.\n\n  But let's check the data:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-02-02): [2.985, 2.437, ... , 3.290]\n    Day 2 (2017-02-03): [2.559, 2.163, ... , 3.168]\n    Day 3 (2017-02-04): [2.528, 2.163, ... , 2.955]\n    Day 4 (2017-02-05): [2.437, 1.980, ... , 2.894]\n\n  We see a slight downward trend? But then again, the last day (2017-02-05) has the lowest values. \n\n  However, without more context, we assume that the next 4 days will follow the pattern of the last day (2017-02-05) but we might adjust for a possible trend.\n\n  But note: the problem does not specify the time of year, and we don't have long-term data. So we avoid complex trend modeling.\n\n  We decide: use the last day (2017-02-05) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n  But what if there is a weekly pattern? We don't have data for the same day of the week. The last day is a Sunday? (2017-02-05 is a Sunday). The next 4 days would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? We don't have Monday data to compare.\n\n  Given the ambiguity, we stick to the last day.\n\n  However, let's consider: the problem says \"Low UseFul Load\", and we are in February (winter in the northern hemisphere). The load might be increasing as we move towards the week? But we don't have enough data to model that.\n\n  Therefore, we will use the last 24 hours (2017-02-05) and repeat it for the next 4 days.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\" in the data we are going to forecast? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided data? But the provided data we have is complete. So we are to forecast without missing values.\n\n  We are to forecast 96 points without missing values.\n\n  So our forecast:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-02-06): same as 2017-02-05\n    Day 2 (2017-02-07): same as 2017-02-05\n    Day 3 (2017-02-08): same as 2017-02-05\n    Day 4 (2017-02-09): same as 2017-02-05\n\n  But we can also consider a slight adjustment: take the average of the last 4 days for each hour? That might smooth out any daily variation.\n\n  Let's compare:\n\n    Option 1: Use the last day (2017-02-05) only.\n    Option 2: Use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n  We do not know which is better. However, since the problem does not specify, and we are to choose one, we choose Option  Option 2: averaging. Why? Because it might be more robust.\n\n  But note: the data for 2017-02-05 is lower than the previous days. If we average, we are including higher values from the past. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the recent days? But again, without a clear trend, we do the simple average.\n\n  We decide: for each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average over the 4 days.\n\n  Example for hour 00:00: \n      (2.985 + 2.559 + 2.528 + 2.437) / 4 = (2.509) approximately.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We don't have any in the provided data, so we can compute the average.\n\n  However, the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning in the provided data? But the provided data we have is complete. So we proceed.\n\n  Steps for Option 2:\n\n    Step 1: Group the data by hour (ignoring the day).\n    Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the 4 values.\n    Step 3: Use that mean for each hour and repeat for 4 days.\n\n  But note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days (96 hours). So we can reshape into 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours).\n\n  Let's do it:\n\n    Hour 0: [2.985, 2.559, 2.528, 2.437] -> mean = (2.985+2.559+2.528+2.437)/4 = 10.509/4 = 2.62725\n    Hour 1: [2.437, 2.163, 2.163, 1.980] -> (2.437+2.163+2.163+1.980)/4 = 8.743/4 = 2.18575\n    ... and so on.\n\n  Then we create 4 days of data by repeating the same 24-hour average for 4 days.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"Low UseFul Load\", and we are in February. The average might be a safe choice.\n\n  But let's consider: the last day (Sunday) might be lower than the weekdays. The next 4 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? We don't have data for Monday. So the average of 4 days (which includes Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) might be more representative for the next days? \n\n  We don't been given the days of the week, but:\n\n      2017-02-02: Thursday\n      2017-02-03: Friday\n      2017-02-04: Saturday\n      2017-02-05: Sunday\n\n  So the next 4 days: Monday (2017-02-06), Tuesday (2017-02-07), Wednesday (2017-02-08), Thursday (2017-02-09).\n\n  We don't have Monday-Thursday data? We only have Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n  Therefore, we might consider:\n\n    For Monday: we don't have a Monday in the past. So we cannot do a Monday average.\n\n  Given the lack of data, we stick to the average of the available 4 days.\n\n  Alternatively, we could use the last week same day? But we don't have a week ago.\n\n  So we proceed with the average.\n\n  We'll compute the average for each hour across the 4 days and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n  We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  Let's compute the averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (2.985 + 2.559 + 2.528 + 2.437) / 4 = 10.509 / 4 = 2.62725 -> 2.627\n    Hour 1: (2.437 + 2.163 + 2.163 + 1.980) / 4 = 8.743 / 4 = 2.18575 -> 2.186\n    Hour 2: (2.071 + 1.949 + 1.919 + 1.767) / 4 = 7.706 / 4 = 1.9265 -> 1.927\n    Hour 3: (1.980 + 1.706 + 1.736 + 1.584) / 4 = 7.006 / 4 = 1.7515 -> 1.752\n    Hour 4: (1.919 + 1.736 + 1.736 + 1.523) / 4 = 6.914 / 4 = 1.7285 -> 1.729\n    Hour 5: (2.071 + 1.706 + 1.858 + 1.675) / 4 = 7.31 / 4 = 1.8275 -> 1.828\n    Hour 6: (2.254 + 1.888 + 2.132 + 1.858) / 4 = 8.132 / 4 = 2.033 -> 2.033\n    Hour 7: (2.924 + 2.619 + 2.924 + 2.589) / 4 = 11.056 / 4 = 2.764 -> 2.764\n    Hour 8: (3.594 + 3.594 + 3.564 + 3.290) / 4 = 14.042 / 4 = 3.5105 -> 3.511\n    Hour 9: (3.198 + 3.259 + 3.076 + 3.076) / 4 = 12.609 / 4 = 3.15225 -> 3.152\n    Hour 10: (2.863 + 3.076 + 2.894 + 2.772) / 4 = 11.605 / 4 = 2.90125 -> 2.901\n    Hour 11: (3.350 + 3.716 + 3.015 + 3.198) / 4 = 13.279 / 4 = 3.31975 -> 3.320\n    Hour 12: (3.320 + 3.472 + 2.924 + 3.046) / 4 = 12.762 / 4 = 3.1905 -> 3.191\n    Hour 13: (3.198 + 3.350 + 2.772 + 2.833) / 4 = 12.153 / 4 = 3.03825 -> 3.038\n    Hour 14: (3.046 + 3.411 + 2.772 + 2.467) / 4 = 11.696 / 4 = 2.924 -> 2.924\n    Hour 15: (2.985 + 3.411 + 2.833 + 2.406) / 4 = 11.635 / 4 = 2.90875 -> 2.909\n    Hour 16: (3.259 + 3.807 + 2.924 + 2.619) / 4 = 12.609 / 4 = 3.15225 -> 3.152\n    Hour 17: (3.411 + 4.234 + 3.229 + 3.107) / 4 = 13.981 / 4 = 3.49525 -> 3.495\n    Hour 18: (3.686 + 4.203 + 3.411 + 3.411) / 4 = 14.711 / 4 = 3.67775 -> 3.678\n    Hour 19: (4.569 + 4.782 + 4.051 + 4.082) / 4 = 17.484 / 4 = 4.371 -> 4.371\n    Hour 20: (4.691 + 4.782 + 4.142 + 4.538) / 4 = 18.153 / 4 = 4.53825 -> 4.538\n    Hour 21: (4.508 + 4.356 + 3.960 + 4.112) / 4 = 16.936 / 4 = 4.234 -> 4.234\n    Hour 22: (3.929 + 3.807 + 3.503 + 3.533) / 4 = 14.772 / 4 = 3.693 -> 3.693\n    Hour 23: (3.290 + 3.168 + 2.955 + 2.894) / 4 = 12.307 / 4 = 3.07675 -> 3.077\n\n  Then we create the next 96 hours:\n\n    2017-02-06 00:00:00: 2.627\n    2017-02-06 01:00:00: 2.186\n    ... until 2017-02-06 23:00:00: 3.077\n\n    Then repeat the same 24 numbers for 2017-02-07, 2017-02-08, 2017-02-09.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data is recorded every hour? So we have 96 consecutive hours.\n\n  We generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-02-06 00:00:00\n    Then 2017-02-06 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data might be every 15 minutes?
