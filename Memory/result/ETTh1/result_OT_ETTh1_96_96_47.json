        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must account for potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a suitable model. Given the relatively small data (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency with potential daily seasonality, we can consider:\n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecasting the components (trend, seasonality, residual) but 4 days might be too short for daily seasonality.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a model like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet. However, with only 96 points and the need to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon for the given history), we must be cautious.\n\n But note: the data shows fluctuations that might be influenced by both daily patterns and other factors. However, the history is only 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly patterns.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - A simple seasonal naive approach: using the last available day (or the same hour of the previous day) as the forecast. However, the data does not show a clear daily pattern? Let's check:\n\n   For example, at hour 00:00: \n        2017-01-05: 4.854\n        2017-01-06: 3.588\n        2017-01-07: 8.864\n        2017-01-08: 5.909\n\n   This varies a lot, so a naive seasonal (with period=24) might not be stable.\n\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24) might be too many parameters for 4 days.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal model and rely on short-term autocorrelation. But the data has clear intra-day variations.\n\n   - Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we can use a model that can capture seasonality: such as the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and then forecast the seasonally adjusted series with a non-seasonal method (like ETS or ARIMA) and then add back the seasonal component.\n\n   However, with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be estimated poorly.\n\n   - Another idea: use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality? But then we lose the daily pattern.\n\n   - We can try to use an ARIMA model with daily seasonality (i.e., SARIMA). The seasonal period is 24. But fitting a SARIMA model with 24-hour seasonality on 96 points might be challenging because the seasonal part requires at least two full cycles (which we have: 4 cycles of 24) but the non-seasonal part might be over-parameterized.\n\n   - Given the time and the need for a practical solution, we can use a simple approach: average the same hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a constant pattern for the next 4 days? And we don't see a clear consistent pattern.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-08) as the forecast for the next day (2017-01-09), then for 2017-01-10 we can use the average of the last two days? But that might not be robust.\n\n   - We can use a linear regression with time and dummy variables for the hour of the day? But with 96 points and 24 dummy variables, we have 24 dummies + trend, so 25 parameters -> overfitting?\n\n   - Another idea: use a rolling forecast with a simple model. But we are required to forecast 96 points.\n\n   - Given the complexity, we can use the Prophet model which is designed for time series with multiple seasonality and can handle holidays, but we don't have holidays and we have only 4 days. Also, Prophet requires at least two cycles of the seasonality (which we have for daily) but the trend might be hard to capture.\n\n   - However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can proceed without imputation for the history.\n\n   - Considering the above, we decide to use a simple method: the average of the same hour over the 4 available days. This will give us a daily pattern that repeats. Then we can adjust by the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend in 4 days.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (4.854 + 3.588 + 8.864 + 5.909) / 4 = 5.80375\n        hour1: (4.854 + 2.392 + 9.145 + 6.964) / 4 = 5.83875\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same daily pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   But note: the data from 2017-01-05 to 2017-01-08 shows a slight upward trend? Let's see the daily average:\n\n        2017-01-05: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        We can compute:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-05): \n            values: [4.854,4.854,4.784,4.924,5.768,6.261,5.979,5.135,5.276,5.206,4.713,4.502,4.291,4.713,6.472,6.05,6.824,5.909,5.346,6.964,4.995,6.402,5.487,5.065]\n            average = 5.47\n\n        Day2 (2017-01-06): \n            [3.588,2.392,4.15,4.01,4.291,2.744,3.658,2.955,6.261,6.542,6.683,7.035,3.939,5.557,4.291,7.105,4.854,5.909,6.613,6.472,6.683,8.442,6.402,6.402]\n            average = 5.33\n\n        Day3 (2017-01-07): \n            [8.864,9.145,5.487,6.894,7.949,6.331,7.597,9.004,5.557,5.206,5.417,6.05,6.261,6.472,6.824,6.191,6.753,4.995,5.135,6.05,6.05,5.276,5.206,6.261]\n            average = 6.40\n\n        Day4 (2017-01-08): \n            [5.909,6.964,6.964,6.753,6.613,6.472,6.753,6.472,4.362,4.854,5.206,7.386,7.879,6.12,7.668,6.402,6.261,7.386,7.949,7.246,9.215,8.723,9.919,9.497]\n            average = 6.94\n\n        The daily averages: 5.47, 5.33, 6.40, 6.94 -> an upward trend? But note that the first two days are lower and then a jump.\n\n   However, we are only 4 days. We cannot be sure of a trend. Therefore, we can use the average of the last two days for the daily pattern? Or use the entire 4 days.\n\n   Since we are forecasting 4 days ahead, and we have 4 days of history, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form a daily profile and then repeat it 4 days.\n\n   But note: the last day (2017-01-08) has a higher average. We might want to adjust the level? We can do:\n\n        Forecast for day5 (2017-01-09) = daily profile (average of 4 days) * (trend factor) \n        but we don't have a clear trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days to form the daily pattern? That might capture the recent level.\n\n   However, the problem does not to overcomplicate. We are required to provide the forecast.\n\n   We decide: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a daily pattern, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        Let h0 = (value at hour0 of day1 + ... + value at hour0 of day4) / 4\n        ... \n        h23 = (value at hour23 of day1 + ... + value at hour23 of day4) / 4\n\n   Then the forecast for 2017-01-09 00:00:00 is h0, 2017-01-09 01:00:00 is h1, ... until 2017-01-09 23:00:00 (h23), and then repeat for 2017-01-10, 2017-01-11, 2017-01-12.\n\n   But note: the last day in the history is 2017-01-08, so the next day is 2017-01-09.\n\n   We generate the 96 forecasted values by repeating the daily pattern (24 hours) 4 times.\n\n   However, we must note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to tell. And the requirement is to forecast 96 points.\n\n   Let's compute the daily pattern:\n\n        hour0: (4.854 + 3.588 + 8.864 + 5.909) / 4 = 5.80375\n        hour1: (4.854 + 2.392 + 9.145 + 6.964) / 4 = 5.83875\n        hour2: (4.784 + 4.150 + 5.487 + 6.964) / 4 = 5.34625\n        hour3: (4.924 + 4.010 + 6.894 + 6.753) / 4 = 5.64525\n        hour4: (5.768 + 4.291 + 7.949 + 6.613) / 4 = 6.15525\n        hour5: (6.261 + 2.744 + 6.331 + 6.472) / 4 = 5.452\n        hour6: (5.979 + 3.658 + 7.597 + 6.753) / 4 = 5.99675\n        hour7: (5.135 + 2.955 + 9.004 + 6.472) / 4 = 5.8915\n        hour8: (5.276 + 6.261 + 5.557 + 4.362) / 4 = 5.364\n        hour9: (5.206 + 6.542 + 5.206 + 4.854) / 4 = 5.452\n        hour10: (4.713 + 6.683 + 5.417 + 5.206) / 4 = 5.50475\n        hour11: (4.502 + 7.035 + 6.050 + 7.386) / 4 = 6.24325\n        hour12: (4.291 + 3.939 + 6.261 + 7.879) / 4 = 5.5925\n        hour13: (4.713 + 5.557 + 6.472 + 6.120) / 4 = 5.7155\n        hour14: (6.472 + 4.291 + 6.824 + 7.668) / 4 = 6.31375\n        hour15: (6.050 + 7.105 + 6.191 + 6.402) / 4 = 6.437\n        hour16: (6.824 + 4.854 + 6.753 + 6.261) / 4 = 6.173\n        hour17: (5.909 + 5.909 + 4.995 + 7.386) / 4 = 6.04975\n        hour18: (5.346 + 6.613 + 5.135 + 7.949) / 4 = 6.26075\n        hour19: (6.964 + 6.472 + 6.050 + 7.246) / 4 = 6.683\n        hour20: (4.995 + 6.683 + 6.050 + 9.215) / 4 = 6.73575\n        hour21: (6.402 + 8.442 + 5.276 + 8.723) / 4 = 7.21075\n        hour22: (5.487 + 6.402 + 5.206 + 9.919) / 4 = 6.7535\n        hour23: (5.065 + 6.402 + 6.261 + 9.497) / 4 = 6.80625\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-09): [5.80375, 5.83875, 5.34625, ... , 6.80625]  (the 24 values above) )\n        Day2 (2017-01-10): same 24 values\n        Day3 (2017-01-11): same 24 values\n        Day4 (2017-01-12): same 24 values\n\n   But note: the actual data might have a trend? We see the daily averages increasing: 5.47, 5.33, 6.40, 6.94. \n   We could adjust the level of the daily pattern by a trend. However, we don't have enough data to model a trend reliably.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days (which are higher) to form the daily pattern? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the method, and we must provide a forecast, we choose the simple average of the 4 days.\n\n   We generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n   Format: \n        Start from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 and go to 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Example of the first few:\n\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00 5.80375\n        2017-01-09 01:00:00 5.83875\n        ...\n\n   We round to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n   However, note: the input data has some values? But we are averaging and might get more decimals. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output the 96 points.\n\n   Let's code the 24 averages rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 5.80375 -> 5.804\n        hour1: 5.83875 -> 5.839\n        hour2: 5.34625 -> 5.346\n        hour3: 5.64525 -> 5.645\n        hour4: 6.15525 -> 6.155\n        hour5: 5.452   -> 5.452\n        hour6: 5.99675 -> 5.997\n        hour7: 5.8915  -> 5.892\n        hour8: 5.364   -> 5.364\n        hour9: 5.452   -> 5.452\n        hour10:5.50475 -> 5.505\n        hour11:6.24325 -> 6.243\n        hour12:5.5925  -> 5.593\n        hour13:5.7155  -> 5.716\n        hour14:6.31375 -> 6.314\n        hour15:6.437   -> 6.437\n        hour16:6.173   -> 6.173\n        hour17:6.04975 -> 6.050\n        hour18:6.26075 -> 6.261\n        hour19:6.683   -> 6.683\n        hour20:6.73575 -> 6.736\n        hour21:7.21075 -> 7.211\n        hour22:6.7535  -> 6.754\n        hour23:6.80625 -> 6.806\n\n   Then we repeat these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-09 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-09 01:00:00, ... until 2017-01-09 23:00:00 -> first 24\n        Then 2017-01-10 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same 24 values again\n        Then 2017-01-11 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-12 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n   We output in the same format: \n        date (as string) and OT (as float rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n   We write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: We are aware that this is a simple approach and might not capture the dynamics, but given the data and the requirement, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n   If we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model.\n\n   Let's generate the data.\n",
