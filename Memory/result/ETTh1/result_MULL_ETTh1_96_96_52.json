        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). The values are negative, which is acceptable as they represent a specific metric.\n 2. Given the presence of missing values in the original dataset (though the provided 96 points do not have missing values in the example), we must be robust to missing data. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is multiple periods of 24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline, but it might not capture trends well.\n - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonal components. However, note that the data has:\n     - A daily pattern: lower during the day (less negative) and higher at night (more negative) but with some midday peaks? \n     - Also, there might be a slight trend? Let's observe:\n\n    Looking at the data: \n        2017-01-25: min around -3.198, max around -0.959\n        2017-01-26: min around -2.914, max around -0.355\n        2017-01-27: min around -2.878, max around -1.635\n        2017-01-28: min around -3.127, max around -0.782\n\n    The pattern is not entirely consistent. \n\n 4. Given the complexity and the need for a forecast, we might use a model that can automatically capture seasonality and trends.\n\n Since we are in a constrained environment and cannot run complex model fitting, we can use a simple but effective method: \n    - We will decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and then forecast each.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short time series for decomposition.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing method that accounts for seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with a seasonality of 24 periods.\n\n Steps for Holt-Winters:\n   - We assume additive seasonality because the seasonal variations seem roughly constant over time.\n\n But note: the data is very short (only 4 days). We have only 4 seasonal cycles. This might be too few for a reliable model.\n\n 6. Another idea: use a simple average of the same hour from the past 4 days? That would be a seasonal naive method.\n\n    For the first forecasted day (2017-01-29), for hour 00:00:00, we take the average of 2017-01-25 00:00:00, 2017-01-26 00:00:00, 2017-01-27 00:00:00, 2017-01-28 00:00:00.\n\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n    However, we note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the average of each day:\n\n        Day1 (25): average = (-2.807 -2.985 ... -2.310) / 24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            The numbers are between -3.198 and -0.959 -> average around -2.5?\n        Day2 (26): min -2.914, max -0.355 -> average might be a bit higher (less negative) than day1?\n        Day3 (27): min -2.878, max -1.635 -> average might be around -2.2?\n        Day4 (28): min -3.127, max -0.782 -> average around -2.5?\n\n    Actually, we can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n            -2.807, -2.985, -3.056, -3.092, -3.056, -3.092, -3.020, -3.198, -2.914, -3.056, -2.487, -2.132, -0.959, -1.244, -1.457, -1.954, -2.381, -2.452, -3.198, -2.239, -1.848, -1.670, -2.097, -2.310\n            Sum = -54.256 -> average = -54.256/24 = -2.2607\n\n        Day2: \n            -2.594, -2.701, -2.736, -2.772, -2.807, -2.807, -2.772, -2.665, -2.274, -2.274, -2.132, -0.995, -0.355, -0.497, -0.959, -1.173, -2.168, -2.594, -2.914, -2.239, -1.883, -1.848, -2.097, -2.381\n            Sum = -48.179 -> average = -2.0075\n\n        Day3:\n            -2.630, -2.772, -2.843, -2.843, -2.843, -2.878, -2.843, -2.807, -2.203, -2.274, -2.274, -2.239, -1.635, -1.741, -1.954, -2.025, -2.203, -2.452, -2.807, -1.812, -1.777, -1.777, -1.883, -2.168\n            Sum = -52.164 -> average = -2.1735\n\n        Day4:\n            -2.274, -2.559, -2.701, -2.736, -2.736, -2.736, -2.736, -2.736, -2.523, -2.594, -2.630, -1.777, -0.782, -0.782, -1.102, -1.848, -2.416, -2.701, -3.127, -2.452, -2.381, -2.416, -2.452, -2.630\n            Sum = -53.201 -> average = -2.2167\n\n    The daily averages: -2.2607, -2.0075, -2.1735, -2.2167 -> no clear trend? \n\n    Therefore, we can use the seasonal naive method: for each hour, average the same hour from the last 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data point for 2017-01-29 00:00:00 would be the average of:\n        2017-01-25 00:00:00: -2.807\n        2017-01-26 00:00:00: -2.594\n        2017-01-27 00:00:00: -2.630\n        2017-01-28 00:00:00: -2.274\n\n        Average = (-2.807 -2.594 -2.630 -2.274) /4 = -10.305/4 = -2.57625\n\n    Similarly, for 2017-01-29 01:00:00, average of:\n        2017-01-25 01:00:00: -2.985\n        2017-01-26 01:00:00: -2.701\n        2017-01-27 01:00:00: -2.772\n        2017-01-28 01:00:00: -2.559\n        Average = (-2.985 -2.701 -2.772 -2.559) /4 = -11.017/4 = -2.75425\n\n    And so on.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the original data has missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. Since we are only using the last 4 days and they are complete, we can do this.\n\n 8. However, if we are to be more sophisticated, we might use exponential smoothing for the seasonal indices? But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n 9. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days.\n\n 10. We generate the next 96 points (4 days) by repeating the same pattern? But we are using the average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n 11. We must also note: the data has a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). The next 4 days would be Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed? We don't have data for Sunday, Monday, etc. So we cannot account for weekly seasonality.\n\n 12. Therefore, we stick to daily seasonality.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will create a list for the next 96 timestamps, starting from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-01-28 23:00:00) to 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n\n   For each hour of the day (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we compute:\n\n        forecast_hour_h = average of the same hour from the 4 days we have: \n            day1: 2017-01-25\n            day2: 2017-01-26\n            day3: 2017-01-27\n            day4: 2017-01-28\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00:00) of the first forecast day (2017-01-29): \n        h0 = (value at 2017-01-25 00:00:00 + 2017-01-26 00:00:00 + 2017-01-27 00:00:00 + 2017-01-28 00:00:00) / 4\n\n   Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00:00) of 2017-01-29: \n        h1 = (value at 2017-01-25 01:00:00 + ...) / 4\n\n   And so on for 24 hours.\n\n   Then for the next day (2017-01-30) we use the same set of averages? Because we don't have new data. But note: we are forecasting 4 days ahead, and we are using the same pattern for each of the 4 days? \n\n   However, wait: the problem says we are to forecast the next 96 recorded dates. We are only using the past 4 days to compute the average for each hour. Then we use that same set of 24 hourly averages for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the pattern might change? We don't have information to say it will. So we repeat the same daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 13. Therefore, we compute 24 averages (for hours 0 to 23) and then repeat that same pattern for 4 days.\n\n 14. Steps:\n\n    Let base_dates = ['2017-01-25', '2017-01-26', '2017-01-27', '2017-01-28']\n\n    For hour in range(0,24):\n        values = [ value at that hour from each of the base_dates ]\n        avg = mean(values)\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (2017-01-29, 2017-01-30, 2017-01-31, 2017-02-01), for each day, we assign the 24 averages in order.\n\n 15. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n    Start: 2017-01-29 00:00:00\n    Then 2017-01-29 01:00:00 ... up to 2017-01-29 23:00:00 -> day1\n    Then 2017-01-30 00:00:00 ... -> day2\n    ... until 2017-02-01 23:00:00 -> 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n 16. Let's compute the averages:\n\n    We'll create a list `avg_hourly` of length 24.\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00:00\n        base_dates: \n            2017-01-25 00:00:00 -> -2.807\n            2017-01-26 00:00:00 -> -2.594\n            2017-01-27 00:00:00 -> -2.630\n            2017-01-28 00:00:00 -> -2.274\n        avg0 = (-2.807 -2.594 -2.630 -2.274) / 4 = -10.305 / 4 = -2.57625\n\n    Hour 1 (01:00:00)\n        -2.985, -2.701, -2.772, -2.559 -> (-2.985-2.701-2.772-2.559) = -11.017 -> -2.75425\n\n    Hour 2 (02:00:00)\n        -3.056, -2.736, -2.843, -2.701 -> (-3.056-2.736-2.843-2.701) = -11.336 -> -2.834\n\n    Hour 3 (03:00:00)\n        -3.092, -2.772, -2.843, -2.736 -> (-3.092-2.772-2.843-2.736) = -11.443 -> -2.86075\n\n    Hour 4 (04:00:00)\n        -3.056, -2.807, -2.843, -2.736 -> (-3.056-2.807-2.843-2.736) = -11.442 -> -2.8605\n\n    Hour 5 (05:00:00)\n        -3.092, -2.807, -2.878, -2.736 -> (-3.092-2.807-2.878-2.736) = -11.513 -> -2.87825\n\n    Hour 6 (06:00:00)\n        -3.020, -2.772, -2.843, -2.736 -> (-3.020-2.772-2.843-2.736) = -11.371 -> -2.84275\n\n    Hour 7 (07:00:00)\n        -3.198, -2.665, -2.807, -2.736 -> (-3.198-2.665-2.807-2.736) = -11.406 -> -2.8515\n\n    Hour 8 (08:00:00)\n        -2.914, -2.274, -2.203, -2.523 -> (-2.914-2.274-2.203-2.523) = -9.914 -> -2.4785\n\n    Hour 9 (09:00:00)\n        -3.056, -2.274, -2.274, -2.594 -> (-3.056-2.274-2.274-2.594) = -10.198 -> -2.5495\n\n    Hour 10 (10:00:00)\n        -2.487, -2.132, -2.274, -2.630 -> (-2.487-2.132-2.274-2.630) = -9.523 -> -2.38075\n\n    Hour 11 (11:00:00)\n        -2.132, -0.995, -2.239, -1.777 -> (-2.132-0.995-2.239-1.777) = -7.143 -> -1.78575\n\n    Hour 12 (12:00:00)\n        -0.959, -0.355, -1.635, -0.782 -> (-0.959-0.355-1.635-0.782) = -3.731 -> -0.93275\n\n    Hour 13 (13:00:00)\n        -1.244, -0.497, -1.741, -0.782 -> (-1.244-0.497-1.741-0.782) = -4.264 -> -1.066\n\n    Hour 14 (14:00:00)\n        -1.457, -0.959, -1.954, -1.102 -> (-1.457-0.959-1.954-1.102) = -5.472 -> -1.368\n\n    Hour 15 (15:00:00)\n        -1.954, -1.173, -2.025, -1.848 -> (-1.954-1.173-2.025-1.848) = -7.000 -> -1.750\n\n    Hour 16 (16:00:00)\n        -2.381, -2.168, -2.203, -2.416 -> (-2.381-2.168-2.203-2.416) = -9.168 -> -2.292\n\n    Hour 17 (17:00:00)\n        -2.452, -2.594, -2.452, -2.701 -> (-2.452-2.594-2.452-2.701) = -10.199 -> -2.54975\n\n    Hour 18 (18:00:00)\n        -3.198, -2.914, -2.807, -3.127 -> (-3.198-2.914-2.807-3.127) = -12.046 -> -3.0115\n\n    Hour 19 (19:00:00)\n        -2.239, -2.239, -1.812, -2.452 -> (-2.239-2.239-1.812-2.452) = -8.742 -> -2.1855\n\n    Hour 20 (20:00:00)\n        -1.848, -1.883, -1.777, -2.381 -> (-1.848-1.883-1.777-2.381) = -7.889 -> -1.97225\n\n    Hour 21 (21:00:00)\n        -1.670, -1.848, -1.777, -2.416 -> (-1.670-1.848-1.777-2.416) = -7.711 -> -1.92775\n\n    Hour 22 (22:00:00)\n        -2.097, -2.097, -1.883, -2.452 -> (-2.097-2.097-1.883-2.452) = -8.529 -> -2.13225\n\n    Hour 23 (23:00:00)\n        -2.310, -2.381, -2.168, -2.630 -> (-2.310-2.381-2.168-2.630) = -9.489 -> -2.37225\n\n 17. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n    Day1: 2017-01-29: from hour0 to hour23: [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n    Day2: 2017-01-30: same list [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n    Day3: 2017-01-31: same list\n    Day4: 2017-02-01: same list\n\n 18. Format the output:\n\n    We must output in the same format as the input, with the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted MULL values.\n\n    Example:\n\n        2017-01-29 00:00:00 -2.57625\n        2017-01-29 01:00:00 -2.75425\n        ...\n\n 19. We note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 20. Let's write the data:\n\n    We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-29 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until we have 96 records.\n\n 21. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 1, 29, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n    But we have the list of 24 averages. We need to repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 22. The forecasted values:\n\n        values = []\n        for i in range(4):   # 4 days\n            for j in range(24):\n                values.append( round(avg_hourly[j], 3) )\n\n 23. Then we output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-01-29 00:00:00 -2.576\n        2017-01-29 01:00:00 -2.754\n        ... \n\n 24. But note: the averages we computed are:\n\n        Hour0: -2.57625 -> -2.576\n        Hour1: -2.75425 -> -2.754\n        Hour2: -2.834 -> -2.834\n        Hour3: -2.86075 -> -2.861\n        Hour4: -2.8605 -> -2.860\n        Hour5: -2.87825 -> -2.878\n        Hour6: -2.84275 -> -2.843\n        Hour7: -2.8515 -> -2.852\n        Hour8: -2.4785 -> -2.478\n        Hour9: -2.5495 -> -2.550\n        Hour10: -2.38075 -> -2.381\n        Hour11: -1.78575 -> -1.786\n        Hour12: -0.93275 -> -0.933\n        Hour13: -1.066 -> -1.066\n        Hour14: -1.368 -> -1.368\n        Hour15: -1.750 -> -1.750\n        Hour16: -2.292 -> -2.292\n        Hour17: -2.54975 -> -2.550\n        Hour18: -3.0115 -> -3.012\n        Hour19: -2.1855 -> -2.186\n        Hour20: -1.97225 -> -1.972\n        Hour21: -1.92775 -> -1.928\n        Hour22: -2.13225 -> -2.132\n        Hour23: -2.37225 -> -2.372\n\n 25. Now, we write the 96 lines.\n\n 26. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are generating a complete forecast. We are not given any in the next 96, so we output the complete 96.\n\n 27. Let's generate the output.\n\n 28. We must be cautious: the original data ends at 2017-01-28 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-01-29 00:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 30. We output in the exact format as the input, with the same spacing? The input had:\n\n        \"2017-01-25 00:00:00 -2.807\"\n\n    We'll do: \n        \"{date} {value:.3f}\"\n\n    But note: the value is negative, so we format to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. We write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n 32. Let's code the output.\n\n However, since we are writing manually, we will write the 96 lines.\n\n But note: 96 lines is long, but we must output all.\n\n 33. We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-01-29 00:00:00 -2.576\n        2017-01-29 01:00:00 -2.754\n        2017-01-29 02:00:00 -2.834\n        2017-01-29 03:00:00 -2.861\n        2017-01-29 04:00:00 -2.860\n        2017-01-29 05:00:00 -2.878\n        2017-01-29 06:00:00 -2.843\n        2017-01-29 07:00:00 -2.852\n        2017-01-29 08:00:00 -2.478\n        2017-01-29 09:00:00 -2.550\n        2017-01-29 10:00:00 -2.381\n        2017-01-29 11:00:00 -1.786\n        2017-01-29 12:00:00 -0.933\n        2017-01-29 13:00:00 -1.066\n        2017-01-29 14:00:00 -1.368\n        2017-01-29 15:00:00 -1.750\n        2017-01-29 16:00:00 -2.292\n        2017-01-29 17:00:00 -2.550\n        2017-01-29 18:00:00 -3.012\n        2017-01-29 19:00:00 -2.186\n        2017-01-29 20:00:00 -1.972\n        2017-01-29 21:00:00 -1.928\n        2017-01-29 22:00:00 -2.132\n        2017-01-29 23:00:00 -2.372\n\n        Then for 2017-01-30: same values again.\n\n        We'll do 4 days.\n\n 34. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-29\n        Day2: 2017-01-30\n        Day3: 2017-01-31\n        Day4: 2017-02-01\n\n 35. We write the 4 days, each with the 24 values.\n\n 36. We must be careful: February 2017 has 28 days? 2017 is not a leap year. So after 2017-01-31 comes 2017-02-01.\n\n 37. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 38. We note: the rounding we did is to 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. Let's write the answer.\n",
