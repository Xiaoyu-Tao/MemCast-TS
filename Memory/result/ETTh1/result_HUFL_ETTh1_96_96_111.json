        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there are missing values in the provided data? But the provided data for the past 96 dates seems complete? \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points, I don't see any missing. So we assume the provided 96 are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is time series with potential seasonality (daily, weekly) and trends, we can use a model that captures these.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement for accuracy, we might consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even machine learning models. \n    However, without the ability to run code here, we have to rely on a reasonable approach.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n    - We observe a daily pattern (24 hours) in the data. For example, the temperature drops during the day and rises at night? \n      Looking at the data: \n        On 2017-09-18: \n          starts at 11.253, drops to -15.004 at 12:00, then rises again to 5.827 at 07:00? Actually, it goes to -8.707 at 09:00 and then to -15.004 at 12:00, then recovers.\n\n    Actually, the pattern is not exactly the same every day, but there is a general trend of a dip during the day and recovery at night.\n\n 5. We can use a naive approach: \n    - Use the last available day (2017-09-21) as a base and adjust with the trend observed in the previous days? \n    - But we have 4 days of data. We can compute the average daily pattern and then project forward.\n\n 6. However, note that the problem says there are missing values in the data? But the provided 96 points are complete. \n    for the next 96, we have to generate without missing? So we must output 96 values.\n\n 7. Since we cannot run a model, we have to simulate a forecast. We can do:\n\n    Option: \n      - Use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for each hour in the day (0 to 23) for the next 4 days (so 4*24=96 hours):\n\n        For hour h (e.g., 0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00) in the day:\n          Let v1 = value at hour h on 2017-09-18\n          v2 = value at hour h on 2017-09-19\n          v3 = value at hour h on 2017-09-20\n          v4 = value at hour h on 2017-09-21\n\n        Then the forecast for the same hour on the next day (2017-09-22) would be: (v1+v2+v3+v4)/4\n        Similarly, for 2017-09-23, 2017-09-24, 2017-09-25, we can use the same average? \n\n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days, and we have 4 days of history. We can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    However, we might want to account for a trend? The data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving window? But without a clear trend, the average per hour might be acceptable.\n\n 8. But let's check the data for the same hour across days:\n\n    Example for 00:00:\n        2017-09-18: 11.253\n        2017-09-19: 13.195\n        2017-09-20: 11.588\n        2017-09-21: 9.109\n\n        Average = (11.253 + 13.195 + 11.588 + 9.109) /4 = 11.28625\n\n    Then for 2017-09-22 00:00:00, we forecast 11.286.\n\n    Similarly, for 01:00:\n        2017-09-18: 10.784\n        2017-09-19: 12.793\n        2017-09-20: 11.521\n        2017-09-21: 8.841\n        Average = (10.784+12.793+11.521+8.841)/4 = 10.98475\n\n    And so on.\n\n 9. However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (Monday to Thursday? We don't know the day of week). \n    Since we don't have weekly data, we assume the pattern is daily.\n\n 10. We generate 4 days of data by repeating the same daily pattern (the average of the 4 days for each hour) for the next 4 days.\n\n 11. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? But we are given 96 points without missing? \n     And we are to forecast 96 points without missing? So we output 96 points.\n\n 12. We'll generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-09-22 00:00:00.\n\n 13. Steps:\n\n      Start date: 2017-09-22 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-09-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n\n      For each hour (0 to 23) in the day, we compute the average of that hour from the 4 historical days.\n\n      Then we assign:\n          Day 1 (2017-09-22): [avg_0, avg_1, ... avg_23]\n          Day 2 (2017-09-23): same as Day 1? But we can use the same pattern? \n          However, we computed the average for each hour, so we use the same set of averages for each day.\n\n      But wait, we have 4 days of history and we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same daily pattern for each of the 4 days.\n\n 14. However, we might want to adjust for a slight trend? Since the last day (2017-09-21) has lower values? \n      We could use a weighted average? But without a clear trend, we stick to the simple average.\n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n      For hour 0 (00:00): \n          values = [11.253, 13.195, 11.588, 9.109] -> avg = (11.253+13.195+11.588+9.109)/4 = 11.28625\n      For hour 1 (01:00):\n          values = [10.784, 12.793, 11.521, 8.841] -> (10.784+12.793+11.521+8.841)/4 = 10.98475\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 16. Then for each day in the forecast period (2017-09-22 to 2017-09-25) 4 days), we assign the 24 hourly averages.\n\n 17. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: date and HUFL.\n\n 18. We note that the historical data has 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 19. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (11.253 + 13.195 + 11.588 + 9.109) / 4 = 11.28625 -> 11.286\n        hour1: (10.784 + 12.793 + 11.521 + 8.841) / 4 = 10.98475 -> 10.985\n        hour2: (9.444 + 9.980 + 10.516 + 8.707) / 4 = 9.66175 -> 9.662\n        hour3: (9.310 + 11.788 + 9.511 + 9.377) / 4 = 9.9965 -> 9.997\n        hour4: (9.243 + 11.721 + 9.645 + 9.109) / 4 = 9.9295 -> 9.930\n        hour5: (10.650 + 11.454 + 11.186 + 9.042) / 4 = 10.583 -> 10.583\n        hour6: (11.922 + 12.056 + 10.650 + 9.779) / 4 = 11.10175 -> 11.102\n        hour7: (5.827 + 10.784 + 10.047 + 7.234) / 4 = 8.473 -> 8.473\n        hour8: (-1.072 + 8.774 + 10.248 + 7.636) / 4 = 6.3965 -> 6.397\n        hour9: (-8.707 + 4.488 + 8.172 + 6.631) / 4 = 2.646 -> 2.646\n        hour10: (-9.913 + 5.157 + 7.100 + 3.014) / 4 = 1.3395 -> 1.340\n        hour11: (-11.186 + 5.157 + 8.239 -0.603) / 4 = 0.40175 -> 0.402\n        hour12: (-15.004 + 4.488 + 4.086 + 3.081) / 4 = -0.83725 -> -0.837\n        hour13: (-14.401 + 3.282 + 3.818 -2.612) / 4 = -2.47825 -> -2.478\n        hour14: (-11.989 + 2.679 + 2.076 + 4.019) / 4 = -0.80375 -> -0.804\n        hour15: (-7.971 + 4.756 + 3.215 + 5.425) / 4 = 1.35625 -> 1.356\n        hour16: (-2.076 + 6.028 + 4.086 + 5.358) / 4 = 3.349 -> 3.349\n        hour17: (4.689 + 7.904 + 6.832 + 7.234) / 4 = 6.66475 -> 6.665\n        hour18: (7.569 + 7.435 + 6.966 + 6.698) / 4 = 7.167 -> 7.167\n        hour19: (8.975 + 7.569 + 6.899 + 6.966) / 4 = 7.60225 -> 7.602\n        hour20: (8.640 + 7.167 + 6.631 + 6.363) / 4 = 7.20025 -> 7.200\n        hour21: (9.310 + 6.899 + 5.760 + 8.439) / 4 = 7.602 -> 7.602\n        hour22: (11.320 + 8.975 + 5.224 + 8.239) / 4 = 8.4395 -> 8.440\n        hour23: (11.989 + 10.449 + 8.038 + 10.717) / 4 = 10.29825 -> 10.298\n\n 20. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-22 00:00:00 -> hour0: 11.286\n               2017-09-22 01:00:00 -> hour1: 10.985\n               ... until 2017-09-22 23:00:00 -> hour23: 10.298\n\n        Day2: 2017-09-23 00:00:00 -> hour0: 11.286\n               2017-09-23 01:00:00 -> hour1: 10.985\n               ... same pattern\n\n        Day3: 2017-09-24: same pattern\n        Day4: 2017-09-25: same pattern\n\n 21. But note: we are using the same daily pattern for all 4 days. This is a naive forecast.\n\n 22. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-22 00:00:00  11.286\n2017-09-22 01:00:00  10.985\n... (for 96 rows)\n```\n\n 23. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-22 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-09-25 23:00:00\n\n 24. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 25. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating without missing.\n\n 26. We output the data.\n\n 27. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-09-22 00:00:00  11.286\n        2017-09-22 01:00:00  10.985\n        2017-09-22 02:00:00   9.662\n        2017-09-22 03:00:00   9.997\n        2017-09-22 04:00:00   9.930\n        2017-09-22 05:00:00  10.583\n        2017-09-22 06:00:00  11.102\n        2017-09-22 07:00:00   8.473\n        2017-09-22 08:00:00   6.397\n        2017-09-22 09:00:00   2.646\n        2017-09-22 10:00:00   1.340\n        2017-09-22 11:00:00   0.402\n        2017-09-22 12:00:00  -0.837\n        2017-09-22 13:00:00  -2.478\n        2017-09-22 14:00:00  -0.804\n        2017-09-22 15:00:00   1.356\n        2017-09-22 16:00:00   3.349\n        2017-09-22 17:00:00   6.665\n        2017-09-22 18:00:00   7.167\n        2017-09-22 19:00:00   7.602\n        2017-09-22 20:00:00   7.200\n        2017-09-22 21:00:00   7.602\n        2017-09-22 22:00:00   8.440\n        2017-09-22 23:00:00  10.298\n\n        Then for the next day (2017-09-23) we repeat the same 24 numbers.\n\n 28. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 29. We write the data in the format.\n\n 30. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 31. We output 96 rows.\n\n 32. We note that the dates are in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 33. We generate the dates: \n        day0: 2017-09-22\n        day1: 2017-09-23\n        day2: 2017-09-24\n        day3: 2017-09-25\n\n 34. We write the data.\n\n 35. We code the output.\n\n 36. We must be cautious: the historical data ends at 2017-09-21 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-09-22 00:00:00.\n\n 37. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 38.
