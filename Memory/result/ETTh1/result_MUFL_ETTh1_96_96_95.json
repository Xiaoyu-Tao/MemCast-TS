        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseFul Load (MUFL) from 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load drops during the day (negative values) and rises at night (positive values).\n 2. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days ahead, we can use a seasonal model. However, the data has missing values? The provided data does not show missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. In the given 96 points, there are no missing values, so we can proceed with the given data.\n 3. We can use a simple seasonal model or a time series model that captures seasonality. Since we are only given 4 days, complex models might not be suitable. We can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day in the available data.\n    - But note: we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? However, the last day (2017-07-19) might be the most representative for the next day? Or we can use a moving average.\n\n However, looking at the data, there is a pattern but also some variation. Since we are to forecast 96 points and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can use the following:\n\n Option 1: Use the last day (2017-07-19) as the forecast for the next day (2017-07-20), then the day after that (2017-07-21) as the same as 2017-07-16? But that might not capture the weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data.\n\n Option 2: Since we only have 4 days, we can compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and use that for each day in the forecast. However, this would make the forecast the same for each day.\n\n Option 3: Use a linear extrapolation? But with seasonality, we can use STL or Holt-Winters, but with only 4 days, it's very short.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the forecast. However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n The data from 2017-07-16 to 2017-07-19: \n   The values at 00:00: 14.036, 13.788, 12.793, 14.747 -> average = (14.036+13.788+12.793+14.747)/4 = 13.841\n   Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values. In the given data, we don't have missing values, so we can compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n However, we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same average for each of the next 4 days? That would be a constant daily pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-07-19) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might be complex.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, I will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For hour h (where h from 0 to 23), the forecast for the same hour on any day in the next 4 days will be:\n        avg_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n But note: the next 4 days are consecutive and we don't have any trend component. This method captures the daily seasonality.\n\n However, let's check if there is a trend? The data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. The values at the same hour are relatively stable.\n\n Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n   Day1: 14.036\n   Day2: 13.788\n   Day3: 12.793\n   Day4: 14.747\n   Average = (14.036 + 13.788 + 12.793 + 14.747) / 4 = 55.364 / 4 = 13.841\n\n Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n   Day1: 13.361\n   Day2: 11.300\n   Day3: 13.077\n   Day4: 13.859\n   Average = (13.361 + 11.300 + 13.077 + 13.859) / 4 = 51.597 / 4 = 12.89925\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n   Day1 (2017-07-20): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n   Day2 (2017-07-21): same as Day1\n   Day3 (2017-07-22): same as Day1\n   Day4 (2017-07-23): same as Day1\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n However, if we had missing values in the history, we would have to impute them. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we should handle missing values if present. Since the provided data does not have missing values, we don't need to impute.\n\n But what if in the future we have missing values? The problem says the data we are given might have missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" -> meaning the provided history might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we are safe.\n\n However, to be robust, we should check for missing values in the provided history. We are given 96 points, and we have 4 days * 24 = 96, so if any row is missing, we would have less than 96. But the data provided has 96 rows? Let me count:\n\n   From 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00: \n       16: 24 hours, 17:24, 18:24, 19:24 -> 96. So we have 96 points. We can proceed.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour (ignoring the day).\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of the 4 values for that hour.\n   Step 3: Create the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00) and assign the average for the corresponding hour.\n\n However, note: the data shows that the pattern might not be exactly the same every day? But with only 4 days, we don't have enough to model weekly patterns. So the average is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (14.036 + 13.788 + 12.793 + 14.747) / 4 = 13.841\n   hour1: (13.361 + 11.300 + 13.077 + 13.859) / 4 = 12.89925\n   hour2: (13.290 + 11.194 + 12.117 + 11.727) / 4 = 12.082\n   hour3: (10.483 + 8.635 + 10.589 + 11.478) / 4 = 10.29625\n   hour4: (11.655 + 9.559 + 8.031 + 10.980) / 4 = 10.05625\n   hour5: (11.762 + 11.122 + 8.386 + 10.696) / 4 = 10.4915\n   hour6: (8.706 + 8.138 + 6.610 + 9.168) / 4 = 8.1555\n   hour7: (4.762 + 4.797 + 4.904 + 6.112) / 4 = 5.14375\n   hour8: (-0.675 + -0.924 + -0.924 + -0.391) / 4 = -0.7285\n   hour9: (-4.264 + -5.437 + -7.498 + -5.010) / 4 = -5.55225\n   hour10: (-5.153 + -8.742 + -10.447 + -4.406) / 4 = -7.187\n   hour11: (-10.554 + -10.483 + -11.549 + -13.752) / 4 = -11.5845\n   hour12: (-3.589 + -11.762 + -12.828 + -13.610) / 4 = -10.44725\n   hour13: (-6.041 + -9.879 + -10.945 + -12.935) / 4 = -9.950\n   hour14: (-4.548 + -9.346 + -8.102 + -10.838) / 4 = -8.2085\n   hour15: (-3.305 + -6.254 + -5.650 + -7.853) / 4 = -5.7655\n   hour16: (-4.122 + -2.452 + -5.046 + -3.234) / 4 = -3.7135\n   hour17: (0.817 + 1.031 + 2.594 + 1.919) / 4 = 1.59025\n   hour18: (5.863 + 4.797 + 2.985 + 4.762) / 4 = 4.60175\n   hour19: (7.995 + 8.102 + 6.858 + 7.143) / 4 = 7.5245\n   hour20: (10.696 + 11.478 + 11.122 + 11.798) / 4 = 11.2735\n   hour21: (10.270 + 11.727 + 11.478 + 12.366) / 4 = 11.46025\n   hour22: (9.061 + 10.554 + 12.650 + 12.437) / 4 = 11.1755\n   hour23: (10.625 + 12.366 + 11.904 + 13.077) / 4 = 11.993\n\n Now, we create the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-07-20 to 2017-07-23) with 24 hours each.\n\n   Day1: 2017-07-20: [13.841, 12.89925, 12.082, 10.29625, 10.05625, 10.4915, 8.1555, 5.14375, -0.7285, -5.55225, -7.187, -11.5845, -10.44725, -9.950, -8.2085, -5.7655, -3.7135, 1.59025, 4.60175, 7.5245, 11.2735, 11.46025, 11.1755, 11.993]\n   Day2: 2017-07-21: same as above\n   Day3: 2017-07-22: same as above\n   Day4: 2017-07-23: same as above\n\n But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. However, in the forecast, we are not given any missing values? We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we output 96 rows.\n\n Format the answer:\n\n   We must output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2017-07-20 00:00:00, [value]\n        2017-07-20 01:00:00, [value]\n        ... \n        2017-07-23 23:00:00, [value]\n        </answer>\n\n However, the example input had the date in the format: \"2017-07-16 00:00:00\" and the MUFL as a float.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-07-20 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-07-20 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-20 23:00:00\n   Then 2017-07-21 00:00:00, ... and so on until 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n\n We have the list of 24 average values. We'll assign:\n\n   For i in range(0, 96):\n        day_offset = i // 24   (0,1,2,3)\n        hour_index = i % 24\n        value = avg_list[hour_index]\n\n We don't need the day_offset for the value, because the same hour of any day gets the same average.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n   But note: the averages we computed with more precision. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Example: 13.841 -> 13.841, 12.89925 -> 12.899, 12.082 -> 12.082, 10.29625 -> 10.296, etc.\n\n However, the original data had up to 3 decimal places, but we can keep the same precision.\n\n But note: the problem does not specify the rounding. We'll output with 3 decimal places as the input.\n\n Let me recompute the averages and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n   hour0: 13.841 -> 13.841\n   hour1: 12.89925 -> 12.899\n   but 12.89925 rounded to 3 decimals: 12.899 (since the 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5, so we don't round up)\n\n   However, let's do it properly: we'll round each to 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places by formatting.\n\n   We'll compute the average and then round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Actually, the input has 3 decimal places, but the averages might have more. We'll round to 3.\n\n   We'll recalc:\n\n   hour0: (14.036+13.788+12.793+14.747)/4 = 55.364/4=13.841 -> 13.841\n   hour1: (13.361+11.300+13.077+13.859)=51.597 -> 51.597/4=12.89925 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 12.899? \n        But 12.89925: the third decimal is 9, the fourth is 2 -> so we leave it 12.899.\n\n   However, let me check: 12.89925, the fourth decimal is 2, so we don't round up the third decimal? \n        Actually, the number is 12.89925. The third decimal is 9, and the next is 2, so we leave it as 12.899.\n\n   But note: 12.89925 is closer to 12.899 than to 12.900? Actually, rounding to 3 decimals: \n        We look at the fourth decimal: 2 -> which is less than 5, so we leave the third decimal as is.\n\n   So we round to 3 decimals by truncating after the third decimal?\n        Actually, we use standard rounding: round(12.89925, 3) -> 12.899\n\n   However, in Python, rounding 12.89925 to 3 decimals: \n        The exact rule: \n            round(12.89925, 3) -> 12.899\n\n   But let me check: \n        The number is 12.89925, which is between 12.899 and 12.900. The midpoint is 12.8995. Since 12.89925 < 12.8995, it rounds to 12.899.\n\n   So we'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll recalc all the averages and round:\n\n   hour0: 13.841 -> 13.841\n   hour1: 12.89925 -> 12.899\n   hour2: 12.082 -> 12.082\n   hour3: 10.29625 -> 10.296\n   hour4: 10.05625 -> 10.056\n   hour5: 10.4915 -> 10.492 (because 10.4915: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal: 1 becomes 2? \n        Actually: 10.4915 -> the third decimal is 1, and the next is 5 -> round up: 10.492)\n   hour6: 8.1555 -> 8.156 (because 8.1555: the third decimal is 5, and the next is 5 -> round up: 5 becomes 6? \n        Actually: 8.1555: the third decimal is 5, and the next is 5 -> we round up the 5 to 6? \n        But note: the rule for 5: if followed by non-zero, we round up. But here it's 5 followed by 5? Actually, the number is 8.1555, which is 8.1555. \n        The third decimal is 5, and the next digit is 5 (which is non-zero) -> so we round up the 5 to 6? \n        Actually, the standard rule: if the digit to be rounded is followed by 5 and then non-zero, we round up. \n        But also, if it's exactly 5 followed by zeros, then we round to the nearest even. \n        Here, we have 5 followed by 5 (non-zero) -> so we round up: 8.156.\n\n        However, let me check: 8.1555 is 8.1555, and we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n            We look at the fourth decimal: 5 -> then we look at the fifth? Actually, we only need to 3 decimals, so we look at the fourth and beyond? \n        The rule: \n            Step 1: Identify the third decimal: 5 (the digit in the thousandths place)\n            Step 2: Look at the next digit (ten-thousandths): 5 -> which is >=5, so we round up the thousandths place by 1.\n\n        So 8.1555 -> 8.156.\n\n   hour7: 5.14375 -> 5.144 (because 5.14375: the third decimal is 3, the fourth is 7 -> round up the 3 to 4? \n        Actually, the fourth decimal is 7 (>=5) -> so we round up the third decimal: 3 becomes 4 -> 5.144)\n\n   hour8: -0.7285 -> \n        We are rounding a negative number: \n        The absolute value: 0.7285 -> rounding to 3 decimals: \n            The third decimal is 8, the fourth is 5 -> we round up the 8 to 9? But 8+1=9 -> 0.729 -> so -0.729.\n\n   hour9: -5.55225 -> \n        Absolute: 5.55225 -> third decimal is 2, fourth is 2 -> so we leave it as 5.552 -> so -5.552.\n\n   hour10: -7.187 -> already 3 decimals? Actually, we computed -7.187, which is -7.187 -> so -7.187.\n\n   hour11: -11.5845 -> \n        Absolute: 11.5845 -> third decimal is 4, fourth is 5 -> we round up the 4 to 5? -> 11.585 -> so -11.585.\n\n   hour12: -10.44725 -> \n        Absolute: 10.44725 -> third decimal is 7, fourth is 2 -> leave as 10.447 -> so -10.447.\n\n   hour13: -9.950 -> already 3 decimals?

Actually, the example:\n\n        \"2017-07-16 00:00:00  14.036\"\n\n   But we can output as: \"2017-07-20 00:00:00,13.841\" or with a space? The problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and the format in the example input was with a space. However, the problem did not specify the output format. But the example input had:\n\n        date    MUFL\n\n   and then the values with a space.\n\n   But the problem's example:\n\n        \"2017-07-16 00:00:00  14.036\"\n\n   So we can use a space? But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n   We'll output in the same format as the input: \n\n        [date string] [space] [MUFL value]\n\n   However, the input had the MUFL value aligned? We don't guarantee alignment, but we can output:\n\n        [date] [space] [value]\n\n   with the value as a float with 3 decimal places.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a comma? The problem did not specify. But the example input did not have a comma.\n\n   Let me see the example input:\n\n        \"2017-07-16 00:00:00  14.036\"\n\n   There are two spaces between the date and the value? Actually, it's hard to tell. But in the problem statement, it's shown with a space.\n\n   We'll output: \n\n        \"2017-07-20 00:00:00 13.841\"\n\n   with a space.\n\n   But note: the example input had the MUFL column aligned? We don't need to align, just separate by space.\n\n   We'll generate the string: \n\n        for each row: f\"{date_str} {mufl_value:.3f}\"\n\n   However, the date_str is in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We have to generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta? \n        But we are not coding, we are writing the answer.\n\n   We know the last date in the input is 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n\n   The next date is 2017-07-20 00:00:00.\n\n   We can write:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-20\n        Day2: 2017-07-21\n        Day3: 2017-07-22\n        Day4: 2017-07-23\n\n   And for each day, the hours: 00:00:00, 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n   Let me write the first few:\n\n        2017-07-20 00:00:00 13.841\n        2017-07-20 01:00:00 12.899\n        2017-07-20 02:00:00 12.082\n        2017-07-20 03:00:00 10.296\n        2017-07-20 04:00:00 10.056\n        2017-07-20 05:00:00 10.492\n        2017-07-20 06:00:00 8.156\n        2017-07-20 07:00:00 5.144\n        2017-07-20 08:00:00 -0.729\n        2017-07-20 09:00:00 -5.552\n        2017-07-20 10:00:00 -7.187\n        2017-07-20 11:00:00 -11.585\n        2017-07-20 12:00:00 -10.447\n        2017-07-20 13:00:00 -9.950\n        2017-07-20 14:00:00 -8.209\n        2017-07-20 15:00:00 -5.766\n        2017-07-20 16:00:00 -3.714\n        2017-07-20 17:00:00 1.590\n        2017-07-20 18:00:00 4.602\n        2017-07-20 19:00:00 7.525\n        2017-07-20 20:00:00 11.274\n        2017-07-20 21:00:00 11.460\n        2017-07-20 22:00:00 11.176\n        2017-07-20 23:00:00 11.993\n\n        Then for 2017-07-21, same values:\n\n        2017-07-21 00:00:00 13.841\n        2017-07-21 01:00:00 12.899\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll write 96 lines.\n\n   We must not omit any.\n\n   Now, we write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: the problem says: \n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n\n        </answer>\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-07-20 00:00:00 13.841\n        2017-07-20 01:00:00 12.899\n        ...
