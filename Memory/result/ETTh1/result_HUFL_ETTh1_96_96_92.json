        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the problem states that the data may have missing values. In the provided data, there are 96 consecutive hours without any missing entries? \n But we are told to be aware of missing values. Since the provided data for the past 96 dates is complete, we can proceed to model the time series.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can observe that the load drops during the day (negative values) and rises at night (positive values).\n 2. We can use a time series model that captures seasonality. Since we have hourly data and the seasonality is daily (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can consider:\n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecasting the components (trend, seasonality, residual) but with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture.\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality. However, with only 4 days (one cycle of 24 points per day, 4 cycles) it might be challenging.\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model.\n\n Considering the data, we see:\n   - The data has a clear daily pattern (24 hours).\n   - There might be a slight upward movement in the overall level? But 4 days is too short to tell.\n\n Approach with SARIMA:\n   We can try to fit a SARIMA model with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24). However, we have only 96 points and we cannot do extensive parameter search.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n   - Since the daily pattern is strong, we can compute the average of the same hour across the 4 days and then adjust by the last known value (or use naive seasonal forecast).\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. For forecasting, we assume the pattern continues.\n\n Simple approach (naive seasonal):\n   Let the forecast for hour h of day d (where d=5,6,7,8,9,10,11) be the average of the same hour in the previous 4 days? \n   However, we only have 4 days. We can do:\n\n   For hour 00:00:00: we have [9.310, 11.855, 13.530, 14.267] -> average = (9.310+11.855+13.530+14.267)/4 = 12.2405\n   But this does not account for any trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (day 4) and add the difference from the previous day? \n\n However, the problem requires 96 points and we must account for the entire period.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are not given a clear trend, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n But note: we are forecasting 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00 (4 days). We can use:\n\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 available days.\n\n   However, this would be a constant for each hour across the 4 forecasted days? That is, the same pattern repeated.\n\n   But we see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. There is some variation.\n\n   We can also consider using the last day (2017-07-07) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day to the next for each hour? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most recent day has more weight.\n\n   Let's use a simple average for each hour. This is a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n   Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n        value_h = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, each day we assign the 24 hours with these 24 average values.\n\n   But note: the data shows a possible increasing trend? For example, at 00:00:00: \n        Day1: 9.310, Day2: 11.855, Day3: 13.530, Day4: 14.267 -> increasing.\n\n   We might want to account for that. We can do:\n\n        forecast_day5_h = value_day4_h + ( (value_day4_h - value_day1_h) / 3 )   [since 3 intervals]\n\n   But this is a linear trend and might be too simplistic.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use linear regression for each hour? But we only have 4 points.\n\n   Given the constraints, we choose the simple average per hour.\n\n   However, let's check the performance: for the last day (2017-07-07) we can try to predict using the average of the first 3 days and compare.\n\n   Example for 2017-07-07 00:00:00:\n        Using days 1,2,3: (9.310+11.855+13.530)/3 = 11.898, but actual was 14.267 -> error of about 2.37.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing for each hour? \n\n   We can try to use the Holt-Winters additive method. But we have to implement it for 4 data points per hour? \n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are only required to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n\n        forecast = (last day's value for that hour) * (average growth factor per day for that hour) \n\n   But again, we have only 4 days.\n\n   Considering the above, we decide to use the average per hour over the 4 days. This is a common naive approach for seasonal data.\n\n   We generate 4 days of the same pattern.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        hour0: (9.310 + 11.855 + 13.530 + 14.267) / 4 = 12.2405\n        hour1: (11.922 + 11.588 + 12.793 + 11.989) / 4 = 12.073\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat the same 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n   However, note that the pattern might not be exactly the same? But we have no more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? But the average is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the provided data? But in the given 96 points, there are none. So we use the provided 4 days.\n\n   We'll calculate the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00: hour0 average\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00: hour1 average\n        ...\n        2017-07-08 23:00:00: hour23 average\n        2017-07-09 00:00:00: hour0 average\n        ... and so on until 4 days.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the data shows a trend? The average might smooth out the trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to project a trend.\n\n   We can also consider using a weighted average where the most recent day has the highest weight. For example:\n\n        weight: day1: 0.4, day2: 0.3, day3: 0.2, day4: 0.1?  But then we are giving more weight to the oldest? \n\n        Actually, we want more weight to the recent. So:\n\n        day1: 0.1, day2: 0.2, day3: 0.3, day4: 0.4\n\n        Then for hour0: 9.310*0.1 + 11.855*0.2 + 13.530*0.3 + 14.267*0.4 = 12.2405? Actually, let me compute:\n\n        = 0.1*9.310 + 0.2*11.855 + 0.3*13.530 + 0.4*14.267\n        = 0.931 + 2.371 + 4.059 + 5.7068 = 13.0678\n\n        This is higher than the simple average.\n\n   We can try to see which one is better by backtesting on the last day? \n\n        For hour0: \n            simple average: 12.2405 -> error: |14.267-12.2405| = 2.0265\n            weighted average: 13.0678 -> error: |14.267-13.0678| = 1.1992\n\n        So weighted average is better for this hour.\n\n   We can do the same for other hours? But we don't have the actual for the next days to compare. \n\n   However, we are forecasting the future. We assume that the most recent day is the most relevant.\n\n   We'll use weighted average with weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] for the four days (from oldest to most recent).\n\n   Steps for each hour h:\n\n        Let d1 = value of hour h on day1 (2017-07-04)\n        d2 = day2 (2017-07-05)\n        d3 = day3 (2017-07-06)\n        d4 = day4 (2017-07-07)\n\n        forecast_h = 0.1*d1 + 0.2*d2 + 0.3*d3 + 0.4*d4\n\n   Then we use this for each hour in the day, and repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the pattern might change? We are not accounting for trend beyond the last day. However, with only 4 days, we cannot capture a long-term trend.\n\n   We'll generate 4 days of the same 24-hour pattern (using the 24 forecast_h values).\n\n   How to generate the dates?\n\n        The last given date is 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n        Next date: 2017-07-08 00:00:00, then 2017-07-08 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list of 96 dates.\n\n   Then we assign the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n   However, note: the pattern is repeated without any change. This is a limitation, but with the data we have, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n   Let's calculate the 24 weighted averages:\n\n        We have the data in order. We can group by the hour of the day (ignoring the date).\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the 4 values.\n\n        Then compute: 0: (2017-07-04 00:00:00: 9.310, 2017-07-05 00:00:00: 11.855, 2017-07-06 00:00:00: 13.530, 2017-07-07 00:00:00: 14.267) -> 0.1*9.310 + 0.2*11.855 + 0.3*13.530 + 0.4*14.267 = 13.0678\n1: (11.922, 11.588, 12.793, 11.989) -> 0.1*11.922 + 0.2*11.588 + 0.3*12.793 + 0.4*11.989 = 12.1849\n2: (10.717, 10.315, 11.588, 12.994) -> 0.1*10.717+0.2*10.315+0.3*11.588+0.4*12.994 = 11.8443\n3: (11.052, 10.918, 12.994, 11.588) -> 0.1*11.052+0.2*10.918+0.3*12.994+0.4*11.588 = 11.7778\n4: (9.712, 9.779, 12.458, 11.454) -> 0.1*9.712+0.2*9.779+0.3*12.458+0.4*11.454 = 11.1128\n5: (12.391, 10.918, 11.253, 11.119) -> 0.1*12.391+0.2*10.918+0.3*11.253+0.4*11.119 = 11.2500\n6: (10.784, 11.721, 10.181, 10.315) -> 0.1*10.784+0.2*11.721+0.3*10.181+0.4*10.315 = 10.6997\n7: (5.425, 4.890, 7.837, 8.105) -> 0.1*5.425+0.2*4.890+0.3*7.837+0.4*8.105 = 7.1016\n8: (1.608, 4.622, 8.239, 1.875) -> 0.1*1.608+0.2*4.622+0.3*8.239+0.4*1.875 = 4.0009\n9: (-1.674, -0.536, 0.670, -0.134) -> 0.1*(-1.674)+0.2*(-0.536)+0.3*0.670+0.4*(-0.134) = -0.1924\n10: (-5.090, -8.707, 1.407, 3.148) -> 0.1*(-5.090)+0.2*(-8.707)+0.3*1.407+0.4*3.148 = -0.7785\n11: (-7.703, -11.320, -1.875, -2.612) -> 0.1*(-7.703)+0.2*(-11.320)+0.3*(-1.875)+0.4*(-2.612) = -5.5006\n12: (-3.751, -12.458, -12.056, -1.340) -> 0.1*(-3.751)+0.2*(-12.458)+0.3*(-12.056)+0.4*(-1.340) = -7.5811\n13: (-4.555, -13.798, -3.014, -2.746) -> 0.1*(-4.555)+0.2*(-13.798)+0.3*(-3.014)+0.4*(-2.746) = -6.4185\n14: (-8.908, -4.488, -10.985, 1.340) -> 0.1*(-8.908)+0.2*(-4.488)+0.3*(-10.985)+0.4*1.340 = -4.9997\n15: (-6.363, 4.086, -0.536, 3.550) -> 0.1*(-6.363)+0.2*4.086+0.3*(-0.536)+0.4*3.550 = 1.1923\n16: (6.564, 1.674, -0.670, 6.832) -> 0.1*6.564+0.2*1.674+0.3*(-0.670)+0.4*6.832 = 3.7778\n17: (6.765, 4.689, 0.938, 7.569) -> 0.1*6.765+0.2*4.689+0.3*0.938+0.4*7.569 = 5.2241\n18: (7.234, 6.028, 6.363, 6.765) -> 0.1*7.234+0.2*6.028+0.3*6.363+0.4*6.765 = 6.5603\n19: (7.837, 8.439, 9.444, 9.712) -> 0.1*7.837+0.2*8.439+0.3*9.444+0.4*9.712 = 9.1019\n20: (9.980, 11.521, 13.329, 12.793) -> 0.1*9.980+0.2*11.521+0.3*13.329+0.4*12.793 = 12.3001\n21: (9.109, 11.119, 13.128, 12.458) -> 0.1*9.109+0.2*11.119+0.3*13.128+0.4*12.458 = 12.0219\n22: (9.310, 12.659, 11.855, 13.999) -> 0.1*9.310+0.2*12.659+0.3*11.855+0.4*13.999 = 12.5601\n23: (10.047, 12.525, 11.454, 12.994) -> 0.1*10.047+0.2*12.525+0.3*11.454+0.4*12.994 = 12.1019\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-07-08): [13.0678, 12.1849, 11.8443, 11.7778, 11.1128, 11.2500, 10.6997, 7.1016, 4.0009, -0.1924, -0.7785, -5.5006, -7.5811, -6.4185, -4.9997, 1.1923, 3.7778, 5.2241, 6.5603, 9.1019, 12.3001, 12.0219, 12.5601, 12.1019]\n        Day2 (2017-07-09): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (2017-07-10): same\n        Day4 (2017-07-11): same\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, so we assume the forecast is complete.\n\n   However, we must output the dates and the HUFL values.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-08 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-08 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n   We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n   Format:\n\n        date: in the same format as input: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n   We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n   However, note: the input data has 2 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   Let's round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Example: 13.0678 -> 13.068\n\n   But note: the input has 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        We have 24 values for one day (the weighted averages we calculated above, rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n        Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n   We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        date, HUFL\n\n   Example:\n\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00, 13.068\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00, 12.185\n        ...\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's code the 24 values:\n\n        hour0: 13.0678 -> 13.068\n        hour1: 12.1849 -> 12.185\n        hour2: 11.8443 -> 11.844\n        hour3: 11.7778 -> 11.778\n        hour4: 11.1128 -> 11.113\n        hour5: 11.2500 -> 11.250\n        hour6: 10.6997 -> 10.700\n        hour7: 7.1016 -> 7.102\n        hour8: 4.0009 -> 4.001\n        hour9: -0.1924 -> -0.192\n        hour10: -0.7785 -> -0.778\n        hour11: -5.5006 -> -5.501\n        hour12: -7.5811 -> -7.581\n        hour13: -6.4185 -> -6.419\n        hour14: -4.9997 -> -5.000\n        But note: -4.9997 is closer to -5.000? Actually, -4.9997 rounded to 3 decimals: \n            Since the 4th decimal is 7, we round up: -5.000? But note: rounding negative numbers: \n            -4.9997 is between -5.000 and -4.999. The rule: round to nearest, and 0.0007 is above 0.0005, so we round away from zero? \n            Actually, we round to the nearest representable: \n                -4.9997 -> the thousandths place: 9 in the thousandths, then the next digit is 7 which is >=5, so we round up the thousandths? \n                But rounding up for negative means making it less negative? \n                We can do: \n                    abs: 4.9997 -> round to 3 decimals: 5.000 -> then negative: -5.000.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use: \n                import numpy as np\n                np.round(-4.9997, 3) -> -5.0? But in Python: \n                round(-4.9997, 3) -> -5.0? Actually, let me test:\n\n                >>> round(-4.9997, 3)\n                -5.0\n\n            So we write -5.000.\n\n        hour15: 1.1923 -> 1.192\n        hour16: 3.7778 -> 3.778\n        hour17: 5.2241 -> 5.224\n        hour18: 6.5603 -> 6.560\n        hour19: 9.1019 -> 9.102\n        hour20: 12.3001 -> 12.300\n        hour21: 12.0219 -> 12.022\n        hour22: 12.5601 -> 12.560\n        hour23: 12.1019 -> 12.102\n\n   Now, we create the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-08 00:00:00, then 2017-07-08 01:00:00, ... 2017-07-08 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-09 00:00:00 ... 2017-07-09 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-10 00:00:00 ... 2017-07-10 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-11 00:00:00 ... 2017-07-11 23:00:00\n\n   We'll generate the dates by starting from '2017-07-08 00:00:00' and adding 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n   We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   We'll output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,HUFL\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00,13.068\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00,12.185\n        ... \n        2017-07-11 23:00:00,12.102\n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the example had a space after the comma? The input had:\n\n        \"2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\" -> actually, the input uses a tab? or multiple spaces? \n\n   The input example:\n\n        \"2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\"\n\n   We see that the input uses a tab or multiple spaces? Actually, in the text it's shown with multiple spaces.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n   We'll output with a comma and then the value, without extra spaces? \n\n   However, the example input in the problem statement uses:\n\n        \"2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\"\n\n   But in the code block, it's shown with a tab? Actually, in the markdown, it's shown as multiple spaces.\n\n   We'll output with a comma and one space for consistency with the example output format we are to use? \n\n   The problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\"\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\n\n   And the example, they used:\n\n        \"2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\"\n\n   But in the problem statement, the data is given with a tab? or multiple spaces? \n\n   We'll output with a comma and then the value? But the problem did not specify the delimiter. However, the example input in the problem statement does not use a comma.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"the complete data\" and the example input is without commas. However, the problem does not specify the output format.\n\n   But the instruction says: \"Please obey the format strictly. And you must give me the complete answer.\"\n\n   And the example output format in the problem statement for the input data is:\n\n        date    HUFL\n        2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\n\n   So we should output with a tab or space? \n\n   The problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and the example input uses a space? Actually, in the text it's hard to tell.\n\n   We'll output with a comma and a space for clarity? But the problem did not specify.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same as the input: a tab? \n\n   In the input, the first line is:\n\n        \"               date    HUFL\"\n\n   Then the data:\n\n        \"2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\"\n\n   It seems there is a tab or multiple spaces. We can use a tab? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem says \"the complete data\", and the input is given in a space separated format, we can use a single space? \n\n   However, the numbers are aligned in the input? \n\n        date             HUFL\n        2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\n        2017-07-04 01:00:00  11.922\n\n   We see that the HUFL column is aligned to the right? So there are multiple spaces.\n\n   We can output with a fixed width? But the problem does not require that.\n\n   We'll output with a comma and a space for simplicity and to be machine-readable.\n\n   But the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data\" and the example input did not use comma. \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the output format. We'll use the same as the input? \n\n   The input has:\n\n        [date string] [space] [HUFL value]\n\n   with the space being a variable number of spaces? \n\n   We can output with a single space? \n\n   Example: \"2017-07-08 00:00:00 13.068\"\n\n   But then the alignment might be off? \n\n   Alternatively, we can output with a tab? \n\n   We'll use a tab to separate the date and the HUFL value.\n\n   How the input was given in the problem? \n\n        The first line: \"               date    HUFL\" -> this has a tab? or multiple spaces? \n\n        The data: \"2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\" -> the date string is 19 characters, then there are 3 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the date string is 19 characters, and then 3 spaces? \n\n        We can output with 3 spaces? \n\n   But to be safe, we'll output with a single tab.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        [date string] + '\\t' + [HUFL string]\n\n   And we'll format the HUFL string to have 3 decimal places.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let base_date = '2017-07-08'\n        We'll create a datetime starting at 2017-07-08 00:00:00, then add hours.\n\n        We have a list of 24 values (the weighted averages for each hour) for one day.\n\n        Then we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n        For i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + i * timedelta(hours=1)\n            value = pattern[i % 24]\n\n        Format the value to 3 decimal places: \n            if positive: format as \"%.3f\" % value -> but this will give trailing zeros.\n            if negative: same.\n\n        Example: 13.0678 -> \"13.3f\" -> 13.068? \n            But note: 13.0678 rounded to 3 decimals is 13.068.\n\n        We can use: \n            formatted_value = format(round(value, 3), '.3f')\n\n        However, we already rounded the value? We have the 24 values as floats, then we round to 3 decimals.\n\n        But note: we did the weighted average and then rounded to 3 decimals? \n\n        Actually, we did the calculation and then rounded. We stored the rounded value? \n\n        We'll recalc the 24 values and then we'll output.\n\n   Let me recalc the 24 values with rounding to 3 decimals at the end.\n\n   We'll recalc:\n\n        hour0: 0.1*9.310 + 0.2*11.855 + 0.3*13.530 + 0.4*14.267 = 0.931 + 2.371 + 4.059 + 5.7068 = 13.0678 -> 13.068\n        hour1: 0.1*11.922+0.2*11.588+0.3*12.793+0.4*11.989 = 1.1922+2.3176+3.8379+4.7956 = 12.1433? \n            Wait, I did 1.1922+2.3176=3.5098; 3.8379+4.7956=8.6335; then 3.5098+8.6335=12.1433? \n            But earlier I had 12.1849? \n\n        Let me recalc hour1:\n\n            day1: 11.922 * 0.1 = 1.1922\n            day2: 11.588 * 0.2 = 2.3176\n            day3: 12.793 * 0.3 = 3.8379\n            day4: 11.989 * 0.4 = 4.7956\n            Sum = 1.1922 + 2.3176 = 3.5098; 3.5098 + 3.8379 = 7.3477; 7.3477 + 4.7956 = 12.1433\n\n        But earlier I wrote 12.1849?

We are not given any in the input, and we are forecasting without gaps.\n\n   We output 96 lines.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\".\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00 13.068\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00 12.143\n        ... (96 lines)\n        </answer>\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem example input had a header? But the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", so only the data points.\n\n   We'll output only the header? The example input had a header: \"date    HUFL\", but the problem does not say to output the header.\n\n   The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n   We'll output only the 96 data lines.\n\n   We'll start:\n\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00 13.068\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00 12.143\n        ...\n\n   We'll do it.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", and the example input had the header? \n\n   The problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then gave a table without header in the data block? \n\n   Actually, the data block started with:\n\n        2017-07-04 00:00:00   9.310\n\n   So no header in the data. We output without header.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines and put them in the <answer> block.\n\n   Let's do it.\n",
