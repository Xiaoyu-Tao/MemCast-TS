        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We must generate 96 forecasted values for the next 96 hours.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data shows some patterns (like daily seasonality and possible weekly effects),\n we can use a time series model that captures seasonality. However, note that we only have 4 days of data (96 hours) for training, which is very limited.\n\n Given the constraints, we can consider:\n   - Using a simple model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or Seasonal Naive, but with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n   - Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA) with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24).\n\n However, note that the data is very short (only 96 points) and we are forecasting 96 points (same length as the history). This is challenging.\n\n After examining the data, we see:\n   - The data has a clear daily pattern: for example, on 2017-02-22, the values are high during the day and drop at night (with a negative dip in the evening).\n   - But the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n Considering the data length, we might use a model that can capture seasonality and trend. We can try:\n   - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive or multiplicative seasonality) with a period of 24.\n\n But note: the data has negative values, so multiplicative seasonality might not be appropriate.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n   - Since we have only 4 days, we can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days and then adjust by the last known value? \n   - However, that might not capture the trend.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are required to provide a forecast, we will use a model that is suitable for short time series with seasonality.\n\n We choose to use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline? But the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated model.\n\n However, with only 4 days, training a complex model might overfit. Therefore, we can use:\n\n   - A seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But again, 4 days is very short.\n\n After consideration, we will use the `ExponentialSmoothing` model from statsmodels with additive trend and additive seasonality (if the data is additive) and a seasonal period of 24.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to output the forecast without coding? We have to simulate the process.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? That is the seasonal naive with averaging.\n\n Let me explain:\n\n   For hour 00:00:00, we have 4 values: \n        2017-02-22 00:00:00: 0.804\n        2017-02-23 00:00:00: 0.804\n        2017-02-24 00:00:00: 4.086\n        2017-02-25 00:00:00: 0.804\n\n   The average for 00:00:00 is (0.804+0.804+4.086+0.804)/4 = 1.6245\n\n   Then for the next 96 hours, we assign:\n        2017-02-26 00:00:00: 1.6245\n        2017-02-26 01:00:00: average of the 01:00:00 values from the past 4 days, and so on.\n\n But note: the data on 2017-02-24 is very different (it has much higher values). This might be a weekend? We don't have context.\n\n However, the problem does not specify if there is a weekly pattern (we only have 4 days, which is less than a week). So we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Therefore, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n But wait: the data for 2017-02-24 is an outlier? Or is it a different pattern? We have to decide.\n\n Since we are an expert, we might consider that the data on 2017-02-24 (which is a Friday) might be different. But we don't have enough data to confirm.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to reduce the effect of the high value on 2017-02-24? \n\n Let's try for 00:00:00: \n   Values: [0.804, 0.804, 4.086, 0.804] -> sorted: [0.804, 0.804, 0.804, 4.086] -> median = (0.804+0.804)/2 = 0.804? \n   Actually, for even number of observations, we take the average of the two middle. The two middle are 0.804 and 0.804 -> 0.804.\n\n But then we lose the information of the high value? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the entire 4 days and average, but then the high Friday might be a pattern? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, and we have to make a choice, we will use the average (mean) because it uses all the information.\n\n However, note that the next 4 days might include a similar pattern? We have:\n   - 2017-02-26: Sunday\n   - 2017-02-27: Monday\n   - 2017-02-28: Tuesday\n   - 2017-03-01: Wednesday\n\n We don't have a Friday in the forecast period? So the high value might not repeat.\n\n Therefore, we might consider using the last 3 days (excluding the Friday) for the forecast? But that is arbitrary.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we will use the entire 4 days to compute the hourly average.\n\n Steps:\n\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the mean of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean for the corresponding hour.\n\n   But note: the forecast period is 4 days? Actually, 96 hours is exactly 4 days.\n\n   So we will have 24 hours * 4 days = 96 hours.\n\n   We compute:\n\n        hour0_avg = (value_day1_hour0 + value_day2_hour0 + value_day3_hour0 + value_day4_hour0) / 4\n        ... for each hour.\n\n   Then we repeat the same 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   But wait, that would be the same pattern every day? And we are forecasting 4 days, so we use the same 24 means for each of the 4 days.\n\n   However, note that the pattern might change? But we don't have a trend component.\n\n   Alternatively, we can add a drift? But we don't have enough data to estimate a drift.\n\n   So we will just use the fixed average for each hour.\n\n   The forecast for the next 96 hours will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-02-26): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ..., hour23_avg]\n        Day 2 (2017-02-27): same as above\n        Day 3 (2017-02-28): same\n        Day 4 (2017-03-01): same\n\n   But note: the data we have shows that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. However, without more data, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will create a list of 24 averages.\n\n   How to align the data? The data is from 2017-02-22 (Wednesday) to 2017-02-25 (Saturday). \n\n   We have 4 days: \n        Day1: 2017-02-22 (Wed) -> hour0: index0, hour1: index1, ... hour23: index23\n        Day2: 2017-02-23 (Thu) -> hour0: index24, hour1: index25, ... hour23: index47\n        Day3: 2017-02-24 (Fri) -> hour0: index48, ... hour23: index71\n        Day4: 2017-02-25 (Sat) -> hour0: index72, ... hour23: index95\n\n   For hour0 (00:00:00): \n        values = [0.804 (index0), 0.804 (index24), 4.086 (index48), 0.804 (index72)] -> average = (0.804+0.804+4.086+0.804)/4 = 1.6245\n\n   For hour1 (01:00:00):\n        values = [0.938, 0.670, 5.626, 0.201] -> (0.938+0.670+5.626+0.201)/4 = 1.85875\n\n   And so on.\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n        2017-02-26 00:00:00: 1.6245\n        2017-02-26 01:00:00: 1.85875\n        ... until 2017-02-26 23:00:00: (average for hour23)\n\n   Then 2017-02-27 00:00:00: again 1.6245, and so on.\n\n   We do this for 4 days.\n\n   However, note: the data on 2017-02-24 (Friday) is very different. It might be an anomaly? But without more context, we include it.\n\n   We are going to compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n   Then we will generate 4 days of forecast (96 hours) by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n   We must also generate the dates: starting from 2017-02-26 00:00:00 and then increment by 1 hour until 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n\n   Note: 2017 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days.\n\n   The next day after 2017-02-25 is 2017-02-26, then 2017-02-27, 2017-02-28, and then 2017-03-01.\n\n   We have to generate 96 timestamps.\n\n   Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        \"2017-02-26 00:00:00\"\n        \"2017-02-26 01:00:00\"\n        ...\n        \"2017-02-26 23:00:00\"\n        \"2017-02-27 00:00:00\"\n        ...\n        \"2017-03-01 23:00:00\"\n\n   And the corresponding HULL value is the average for the hour in the day (0-23) repeated for each day.\n\n   We must be cautious: the data we have for the 4 days might not be representative, but it's the best we can do.\n\n   Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (0.804 + 0.804 + 4.086 + 0.804) / 4 = 1.6245\n        hour1: (0.938 + 0.670 + 5.626 + 0.201) / 4 = (0.938+0.670=1.608; 1.608+5.626=7.234; 7.234+0.201=7.435) -> 4 -> 1.85875\n        hour2: (0.938 + 0.067 + 5.023 + 1.139) / 4 = (0.938+0.067=1.005; 1.005+5.023=6.028; 6.028+1.139=7.167) -> 1.79175\n        hour3: (0.201 + 0.938 + 4.689 + 1.340) / 4 = (0.201+0.938=1.139; 1.139+4.689=5.828; 5.828+1.340=7.168) -> 1.792\n        hour4: (0.469 + 0.000 + 3.550 + 1.273) / 4 = (0.469+0.000=0.469; 0.469+3.550=4.019; 4.019+1.273=5.292) -> 1.323\n        hour5: (0.938 -0.067 + 5.224 + 0.000) / 4 = (0.938-0.067=0.871; 0.871+5.224=6.095; 6.095+0=6.095) -> 1.52375\n        hour6: (0.871 + 0.268 + 4.220 + 0.938) / 4 = (0.871+0.268=1.139; 1.139+4.220=5.359; 5.359+0.938=6.297) -> 1.57425\n        hour7: (1.875 -0.201 + 5.425 + 0.938) / 4 = (1.875-0.201=1.674; 1.674+5.425=7.099; 7.099+0.938=8.037) -> 2.00925\n        hour8: (0.402 + 0.603 + 1.808 + 0.134) / 4 = (0.402+0.603=1.005; 1.005+1.808=2.813; 2.813+0.134=2.947) -> 0.73675\n        hour9: (0.536 + 0.670 + 1.206 + 0.804) / 4 = (0.536+0.670=1.206; 1.206+1.206=2.412; 2.412+0.804=3.216) -> 0.804\n        hour10: (0.268 -0.670 + 1.340 + 1.808) / 4 = (0.268-0.670=-0.402; -0.402+1.340=0.938; 0.938+1.808=2.746) -> 0.6865\n        hour11: (0.536 + 0.268 + 2.076 + 1.541) / 4 = (0.536+0.268=0.804; 0.804+2.076=2.88; 2.88+1.541=4.421) -> 1.10525\n        hour12: (-0.134 -0.201 + 0.536 + 1.139) / 4 = (-0.134-0.201=-0.335; -0.335+0.536=0.201; 0.201+1.139=1.34) -> 0.335\n        hour13: (0.536 + 0.067 + 1.808 + 0.804) / 4 = (0.536+0.067=0.603; 0.603+1.808=2.411; 2.411+0.804=3.215) -> 0.80375\n        hour14: (0.201 + 0.268 + 1.608 + 1.942) / 4 = (0.201+0.268=0.469; 0.469+1.608=2.077; 2.077+1.942=4.019) -> 1.00475\n        hour15: (0.067 -0.067 + 0.938 + 0.335) / 4 = (0.067-0.067=0; 0+0.938=0.938; 0.938+0.335=1.273) -> 0.31825\n        hour16: (-0.938 -1.072 -0.536 -0.402) / 4 = (-0.938-1.072=-2.01; -2.01-0.536=-2.546; -2.546-0.402=-2.948) -> -0.737\n        hour17: (-1.072 -1.407 -0.402 -0.670) / 4 = (-1.072-1.407=-2.479; -2.479-0.402=-2.881; -2.881-0.670=-3.551) -> -0.88775\n        hour18: (-1.808 -1.942 -0.871 -1.072) / 4 = (-1.808-1.942=-3.75; -3.75-0.871=-4.621; -4.621-1.072=-5.693) -> -1.42325\n        hour19: (-1.608 -1.741 -0.737 -1.072) / 4 = (-1.608-1.741=-3.349; -3.349-0.737=-4.086; -4.086-1.072=-5.158) -> -1.2895\n        hour20: (-1.808 + 0.268 -1.005 -1.206) / 4 = (-1.808+0.268=-1.54; -1.54-1.005=-2.545; -2.545-1.206=-3.751) -> -0.93775\n        hour21: (-1.608 + 0.804 -0.201 -1.942) / 4 = (-1.608+0.804=-0.804; -0.804-0.201=-1.005; -1.005-1.942=-2.947) -> -0.73675\n        hour22: (-0.335 + 2.210 -0.201 + 0.000) / 4 = (-0.335+2.210=1.875; 1.875-0.201=1.674; 1.674+0=1.674) -> 0.4185\n        hour23: (0.938 + 4.354 + 0.737 + 1.139) / 4 = (0.938+4.354=5.292; 5.292+0.737=6.029; 6.029+1.139=7.168) -> 1.792\n\n   Now, we create the forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-26: \n            00:00:00 -> 1.6245\n            01:00:00 -> 1.85875\n            02:00:00 -> 1.79175\n            03:00:00 -> 1.792\n            04:00:00 -> 1.323\n            05:00:00 -> 1.52375\n            06:00:00 -> 1.57425\n            07:00:00 -> 2.00925\n            08:00:00 -> 0.73675\n            09:00:00 -> 0.804\n            10:00:00 -> 0.6865\n            11:00:00 -> 1.10525\n            12:00:00 -> 0.335\n            13:00:00 -> 0.80375\n            14:00:00 -> 1.00475\n            15:00:00 -> 0.31825\n            16:00:00 -> -0.737\n            17:00:00 -> -0.88775\n            18:00:00 -> -1.42325\n            19:00:00 -> -1.2895\n            20:00:00 -> -0.93775\n            21:00:00 -> -0.73675\n            22:00:00 -> 0.4185\n            23:00:00 -> 1.792\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n   We must format the numbers to 3 decimal places?

Actually, we can round the average to 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimals without worrying about the rounding method? We'll use standard rounding.\n\n   We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete data\", meaning we must output 96 rows.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour0: round(1.6245, 3) -> 1.625\n        hour1: round(1.85875, 3) -> 1.859\n        hour2: round(1.79175, 3) -> 1.792\n        hour3: round(1.792, 3) -> 1.792\n        hour4: round(1.323, 3) -> 1.323\n        hour5: round(1.52375, 3) -> 1.524\n        hour6: round(1.57425, 3) -> 1.574\n        hour7: round(2.00925, 3) -> 2.009\n        hour8: round(0.73675, 3) -> 0.737\n        hour9: round(0.804, 3) -> 0.804   (exactly 0.804)\n        hour10: round(0.6865, 3) -> 0.687\n        hour11: round(1.10525, 3) -> 1.105\n        hour12: round(0.335, 3) -> 0.335\n        hour13: round(0.80375, 3) -> 0.804\n        hour14: round(1.00475, 3) -> 1.005\n        hour15: round(0.31825, 3) -> 0.318\n        hour16: round(-0.737, 3) -> -0.737\n        hour17: round(-0.88775, 3) -> -0.888\n        hour18: round(-1.42325, 3) -> -1.423\n        hour19: round(-1.2895, 3) -> -1.290\n        hour20: round(-0.93775, 3) -> -0.938\n        hour21: round(-0.73675, 3) -> -0.737\n        hour22: round(0.4185, 3) -> 0.419\n        hour23: round(1.792, 3) -> 1.792\n\n   So the pattern for one day:\n\n        [1.625, 1.859, 1.792, 1.792, 1.323, 1.524, 1.574, 2.009, 0.737, 0.804, 0.687, 1.105, 0.335, 0.804, 1.005, 0.318, -0.737, -0.888, -1.423, -1.290, -0.938, -0.737, 0.419, 1.792]\n\n   Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n   Now, we generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-26\n        Day2: 2017-02-27\n        Day3: 2017-02-28\n        Day4: 2017-03-01\n\n   We write:\n\n        2017-02-26 00:00:00  1.625\n        2017-02-26 01:00:00  1.859\n        ... \n        2017-02-26 23:00:00  1.792\n        2017-02-27 00:00:00  1.625\n        ...\n        2017-03-01 23:00:00  1.792\n\n   We must output 96 rows.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: The problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n   We are not interpolating because we are generating the forecast.\n\n   We output the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates (which are the next 96 hours).\n\n   Let's write the output.\n",
