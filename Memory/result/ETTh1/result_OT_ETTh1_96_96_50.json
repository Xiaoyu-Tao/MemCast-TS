        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive records without any missing time stamps? \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points seem complete? We are to forecast the next 96, and we must be aware of potential missing values in the input? \n    But the input provided does not have missing values? So we proceed with the provided 96 points.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates (i.e., 96 rows) in the same format.\n\n 4. Since we are an expert, we choose an appropriate time series forecasting method. Given the data is at hourly intervals and we have seasonality (daily pattern, 24 hours), \n    we can use a model that captures seasonality. However, we only have 4 days of data (96 hours) which is very limited.\n\n 5. Given the limited data, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? But we have 4 days, so we can also consider a simple average of the same hour over the past 4 days?\n    - Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's look at the provided data:\n\n    The data for each day:\n      Day 1 (17th): min ~4.784, max ~10.622\n      Day 2 (18th): min ~6.331, max ~10.833\n      Day 3 (19th): min ~6.402, max ~11.044\n      Day 4 (20th): min ~4.643, max ~9.356\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. But we see daily seasonality: temperatures drop at night and rise during the day.\n\n 7. Given the small data size, we can use a seasonal naive method that takes the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? \n    For example, for the first forecast hour (2017-01-21 00:00:00) we average the values at 00:00:00 of the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th.\n\n    But note: the 17th 00:00:00 -> 5.628\n              18th 00:00:00 -> 9.215\n              19th 00:00:00 -> 7.316\n              20th 00:00:00 -> 6.964\n\n    Average = (5.628 + 9.215 + 7.316 + 6.964) / 4 = 7.28075\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour? But with only 4 points, we can do a simple average.\n\n 9. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing? So for the forecast period, we are to provide 96 points without missing? \n    We are not told to impute the input? We are only given 96 points and we are to forecast 96 points.\n\n 10. We'll use a simple method: for each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 available days.\n\n 11. But note: the last day (20th) might be incomplete? Actually, we have 4 full days: 17,18,19,20 (each 24 hours). So we have 4 values for each hour.\n\n 12. Steps for forecasting:\n      For hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days (which are 21,22,23,24) we set:\n          forecast_value(h) = average of the same hour h from the 4 days (17,18,19,20)\n\n 13. However, this will give the same 24-hour pattern repeated for the next 4 days? That is, the forecast for 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th will be identical in pattern? \n     But note: the 4 days we have are consecutive and we don't see a trend? So this might be acceptable.\n\n 14. But we must be cautious: the problem says the data has missing values? But in the input we don't have any? So we are safe.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we could use a more sophisticated model? But with only 4 days, it's hard to fit a model with multiple seasonality or trends. \n\n 16. We decide to use the average by hour.\n\n 17. How to compute:\n\n     Let's group the data by hour of the day (ignoring the day). We have 24 hours.\n\n     For hour 0: \n         17th: 5.628\n         18th: 9.215\n         19th: 7.316\n         20th: 6.964\n         avg0 = (5.628+9.215+7.316+6.964)/4 = 7.28075\n\n     Similarly for hour 1: \n         17th: 5.487\n         18th: 9.849\n         19th: 6.402\n         20th: 7.246\n         avg1 = (5.487+9.849+6.402+7.246)/4 = 7.246\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 18. Then for the next 4 days (21st to 24th) we assign:\n        Day 21: [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day 22: [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day 23: [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day 24: [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n 19. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told to handle missing in the input? The input we have is complete. \n     And we are to forecast 96 points without missing? So we output 96 points.\n\n 20. We must generate the dates: \n        Start: 2017-01-21 00:00:00 (next after 2017-01-20 23:00:00)\n        Then hourly until 2017-01-24 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 = 96 hours)\n\n 21. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n 22. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n     Hour 0: [5.628, 9.215, 7.316, 6.964] -> 7.28075\n     Hour 1: [5.487, 9.849, 6.402, 7.246] -> 7.246\n     Hour 2: [5.135, 10.833, 6.824, 5.557] -> (5.135+10.833+6.824+5.557)/4 = 7.08725\n     Hour 3: [4.854, 10.622, 7.035, 4.643] -> (4.854+10.622+7.035+4.643)/4 = 6.7885\n     Hour 4: [4.784, 10.060, 7.668, 4.924] -> (4.784+10.060+7.668+4.924)/4 = 6.859\n     Hour 5: [5.557, 9.286, 8.723, 6.331] -> (5.557+9.286+8.723+6.331)/4 = 7.47425\n     Hour 6: [4.854, 9.356, 10.411, 6.331] -> (4.854+9.356+10.411+6.331)/4 = 7.738\n     Hour 7: [5.065, 8.934, 9.356, 6.050] -> (5.065+8.934+9.356+6.050)/4 = 7.35125\n     Hour 8: [5.628, 9.075, 11.044, 5.276] -> (5.628+9.075+11.044+5.276)/4 = 7.75575\n     Hour 9: [5.839, 9.286, 10.411, 5.839] -> (5.839+9.286+10.411+5.839)/4 = 7.84375\n     Hour 10: [6.050, 8.371, 9.356, 4.713] -> (6.050+8.371+9.356+4.713)/4 = 7.1225\n     Hour 11: [6.964, 8.723, 10.482, 7.035] -> (6.964+8.723+10.482+7.035)/4 = 8.301\n     Hour 12: [7.668, 8.512, 10.904, 5.909] -> (7.668+8.512+10.904+5.909)/4 = 8.24825\n     Hour 13: [8.020, 8.231, 10.130, 5.768] -> (8.020+8.231+10.130+5.768)/4 = 8.03725\n     Hour 14: [8.160, 8.020, 9.075, 9.356] -> Wait, the 20th at 14:00? The 20th at 14:00 is 9.356? \n          Actually, the 20th day: \n          14:00: 9.356 (from the data: 2017-01-20 14:00:00  9.356)\n          So: [8.160, 17th 14:00; 8.020, 18th 14:00; 9.075, 19th 14:00; 9.356, 20th 14:00] -> (8.160+8.020+9.075+9.356)/4 = 8.15275\n     Hour 15: [8.301, 7.527, 7.879, 6.824] -> (8.301+7.527+7.879+6.824)/4 = 7.63275\n     Hour 16: [8.160, 6.964, 9.638, 7.668] -> (8.160+6.964+9.638+7.668)/4 = 8.1075\n     Hour 17: [8.160, 7.457, 7.809, 7.738] -> (8.160+7.457+7.809+7.738)/4 = 7.791\n     Hour 18: [9.778, 7.105, 6.894, 7.597] -> (9.778+7.105+6.894+7.597)/4 = 7.8435\n     Hour 19: [9.989, 6.964, 9.145, 7.668] -> (9.989+6.964+9.145+7.668)/4 = 8.4415\n     Hour 20: [10.271, 6.613, 9.286, 6.542] -> (10.271+6.613+9.286+6.542)/4 = 8.178\n     Hour 21: [10.622, 6.331, 9.849, 7.527] -> (10.622+6.331+9.849+7.527)/4 = 8.58225\n     Hour 22: [9.708, 6.683, 7.668, 6.331] -> (9.708+6.683+7.668+6.331)/4 = 7.5975\n     Hour 23: [9.638, 6.824, 7.668, 5.979] -> (9.638+6.824+7.668+5.979)/4 = 7.52725\n\n 23. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 21: \n          00:00:00 -> 7.28075\n          01:00:00 -> 7.246\n          02:00:00 -> 7.08725\n          ... until 23:00:00 -> 7.52725\n\n        Day 22: same pattern: \n          00:00:00 -> 7.28075\n          ... \n\n        Day 23: same pattern\n\n        Day 24: same pattern\n\n 24. We round to 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimals. So we round each average to 3 decimals.\n\n 25. Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n     We'll create a list for the 24 hours:\n\n        h0: 7.28075 -> 7.281\n        h1: 7.246 -> 7.246\n        h2: 7.08725 -> 7.087\n        h3: 6.7885 -> 6.789\n        h4: 6.859 -> 6.859\n        h5: 7.47425 -> 7.474\n        h6: 7.738 -> 7.738\n        h7: 7.35125 -> 7.351\n        h8: 7.75575 -> 7.756\n        h9: 7.84375 -> 7.844\n        h10: 7.1225 -> 7.123\n        h11: 8.301 -> 8.301   (exactly 8.301, because the input had 8.301 and others averaged to 8.301? Actually, the 4 numbers: 6.964,8.723,10.482,7.035 -> 33.204/4=8.301)\n        h12: 8.24825 -> 8.248\n        h13: 8.03725 -> 8.037\n        h14: 8.15275 -> 8.153\n        h15: 7.63275 -> 7.633\n        h16: 8.1075 -> 8.108\n        h17: 7.791 -> 7.791\n        h18: 7.8435 -> 7.844\n        h19: 8.4415 -> 8.442\n        h20: 8.178 -> 8.178\n        h21: 8.58225 -> 8.582\n        h22: 7.5975 -> 7.598\n        h23: 7.52725 -> 7.527\n\n 26. Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n        date from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00\n\n 27. Format: \n        \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the OT value (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n 28. We generate:\n\n        Day 21: \n          2017-01-21 00:00:00  7.281\n          2017-01-21 01:00:00  7.246\n          2017-01-21 02:00:00  7.087\n          ... \n\n        Day 22: \n          2017-01-22 00:00:00  7.281\n          ...\n\n        Day 23: \n          2017-01-23 00:00:00  7.281\n          ...\n\n        Day 24: \n          2017-01-24 00:00:00  7.281\n          ...\n          2017-01-24 23:00:00  7.527\n\n 29. We output in the required format.\n\n 30. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        [the data in the same format as input, 96 rows]\n        </answer>\n\n 31. We write the 96 rows.\n\n Let's code the 24 averages as a list:\n\n   hourly_avg = [\n        7.281, 7.246, 7.087, 6.789, 6.859, 7.474, 7.738, 7.351, \n        7.756, 7.844, 7.123, 8.301, 8.248, 8.037, 8.153, 7.633, \n        8.108, 7.791, 7.844, 8.442, 8.178, 8.582, 7.598, 7.527\n   ]\n\n Then for each day in [21,22,23,24] and for each hour in [0,1,...,23] we output:\n\n        \"2017-01-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00  {value}\"\n\n 32. But note: the day must be two digits: 21,22,23,24.\n\n 33. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta? \n        We don't need to, because we know the pattern.\n\n        Start: 2017-01-21 00:00:00\n\n        Then we have 96 rows.\n\n 34. We write:\n\n        for day_offset in range(4):   # 4 days: 21,22,23,24\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-01-{21+day_offset} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = hourly_avg[hour]\n                print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")\n\n 35. But note: the day 21,22,23,24 are all in January 2017? Yes.\n\n 36. However, we must be cautious: the last provided date is 2017-01-20 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-01-21 00:00:00.\n\n 37. We output the data in the format.\n\n 38. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00  7.281\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00  7.246\n        2017-01-21 02:00:00  7.087\n        2017-01-21 03:00:00  6.789\n        ...\n\n 39. We'll generate the entire 96 rows.\n\n 40. We note: the averages we computed are fixed for each hour.\n\n 41. We output the answer in the required XML-like tag.\n\n 42. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-01-21 00:00:00  7.281\n        2017-01-21 01:00:00  7.246\n        ... (until 96 rows)\n        </answer>\n\n 43. We must be careful: the day 24 is the last day? and then hour 23.\n\n 44. We do it.\n\n 45. We list the hourly_avg again to be sure:\n\n        h0: 7.281\n        h1: 7.246\n        h2: 7.087\n        h3: 6.789\n        h4: 6.859\n        h5: 7.474\n        h6: 7.738\n        h7: 7.351\n        h8: 7.756\n        h9: 7.844\n        h10:7.123\n        h11:8.301\n        h12:8.248\n        h13:8.037\n        h14:8.153\n        h15:7.633\n        h16:8.108\n        h17:7.791\n        h18:7.844\n        h19:8.442\n        h20:8.178\n        h21:8.582\n        h22:7.598\n        h23:7.527\n\n 46.
