        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data size (96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points ahead, \n    we can consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple naive approach. However, we observe:\n    - The data shows a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). For example, the values dip during the night and rise during the day?\n    Actually, looking at the data: \n        On 2017-02-02: \n         00:00: -1.407, then becomes more negative until 03:00-06:00 (around -1.94), then becomes less negative (e.g., 08:00: -1.139, 20:00: -0.201).\n        So it seems that during the day the values are less negative (higher) and at night more negative (lower). \n\n    We can see a pattern that repeats every 24 hours (with 24 data points per day). Therefore, we should use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need for 4 days of forecast, we can use a seasonal model. However, note that we are only given 4 days of history.\n\n 4. We can use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 5. Since the data is small, we can try to fit a model with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n 6. But note: the data has missing values? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete. \n    However, for the forecast we are to produce 96 points without any missing.\n\n 7. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must generate the dates and the forecasted HULL values.\n\n 8. We will use the following approach:\n    - We will use the `statsmodels` library to fit a seasonal ARIMA. However, note that we are in a simulated environment without actual library.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simple method: seasonal naive forecast. But the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated method.\n\n 9. Considering the constraints, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But let's think about the data: \n    The data has a clear daily pattern. We can compute the average pattern over the 4 days and then adjust by the last known values.\n\n 10. However, we are to provide a complete set of 96 points. We must generate the next 96 timestamps and the corresponding HULL.\n\n 11. We can use a simple average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days. We can do:\n\n     For each hour h in [0,23]:\n        Let the value for hour h on day 1 = d1_h, day2 = d2_h, day3 = d3_h, day4 = d4_h.\n        Then the forecast for the same hour on the next day (day5) = (d1_h + d2_h + d3_h + d4_h) / 4.\n\n     Then for day6: same as day2? or we can use the same pattern? Actually, we can use the average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 12. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day1: from -1.407 to -1.206 (min: -1.942, max: -0.134)\n        Day2: from -1.541 to -1.206 (min: -2.143, max: -0.201)\n        Day3: from -1.541 to -1.407 (min: -2.143, max: -0.603)\n        Day4: from -1.741 to -1.474 (min: -2.143, max: -0.603)\n\n     The minimum and maximum values are varying. We might need to adjust for the level.\n\n 13. We can use a seasonal naive method that uses the last available day's pattern? But the problem says to forecast 96 points (4 days). \n     We can use the average of the past 4 days for each hour to form a 24-hour profile, and then use that profile for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 14. Steps for the average method:\n      - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 15. However, this method ignores any trend. We have 4 days and we see that the values are becoming more negative? \n        Day1: average = mean of 24 points: \n        We can compute the overall average for each day:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-02): average = (-1.407 -1.674 ... -1.206) -> let's compute roughly: \n            We see many values around -1.4 to -1.9, and a few around -0.1 to -0.6. \n            We can compute: \n                sum = (-1.407*2 + ... ) -> but we don't have to, we can note the daily average.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day's average as the base and then add the seasonal pattern? \n\n 16. We can use a method called \"Seasonal adjustment with trend\" but we have only 4 days, so trend estimation is weak.\n\n 17. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we will use the average seasonal pattern without trend.\n\n 18. How to compute:\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n        We create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and take the average of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00), we assign:\n            Day 5 (2017-02-06) hour 0: average of hour0 from the past 4 days\n            ... until hour 23.\n\n            Then Day 6: same as Day5? Actually, we use the same 24-hour pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told that the next 96 will have missing, but we are to provide complete data.\n\n 19. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: ( -1.407 (day1), -1.541 (day2), -1.541 (day3), -1.741 (day4) ) -> average = (-1.407 -1.541 -1.541 -1.741)/4 = -1.5575\n        hour1: ( -1.674, -1.808, -1.808, -1.942) -> (-1.674 -1.808 -1.808 -1.942)/4 = -1.808\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. Then we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times (for the next 4 days).\n\n 21. However, we must note: the data shows a slight change from day to day. But without a clear trend, we assume stationarity in the seasonal pattern.\n\n 22. Let's do the calculation for the 24 hours.\n\n 23. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n 24.

Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-06):\n          00:00: -1.558\n          01:00: -1.791\n          02:00: -1.892\n          03:00: -1.992\n          04:00: -2.026\n          05:00: -2.059\n          06:00: -2.026\n          07:00: -1.774\n          08:00: -1.206\n          09:00: -1.424\n          10:00: -1.390\n          11:00: -1.290\n          12:00: -1.357\n          13:00: -1.206\n          14:00: -1.055\n          15:00: -1.156\n          16:00: -1.156\n          17:00: -1.340\n          18:00: -1.423\n          19:00: -0.804\n          20:00: -0.419\n          21:00: -0.503\n          22:00: -0.854\n          23:00: -1.323\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next three days.\n\n 33. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 34. We must be cautious: the last date in the input is 2017-02-05 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-02-06 00:00:00.\n\n 35. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 36. Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-06 00:00:00 -1.558\n2017-02-06 01:00:00 -1.791\n... \n2017-02-09 23:00:00 -1.323\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 37. We note that this is a simple average method. In practice, we might use a more sophisticated model, but given the data size, this is reasonable.\n\n 38. Let's code the generation of the next 96 points.\n\n 39. We'll create a list of the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimals) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 40. The list of averages for hour0 to hour23:\n\n        avg = [\n            -1.558, -1.791, -1.892, -1.992, -2.026, -2.059, -2.026, -1.774, \n            -1.206, -1.424, -1.390, -1.290, -1.357, -1.206, -1.055, -1.156,\n            -1.156, -1.340, -1.423, -0.804, -0.419, -0.503, -0.854, -1.323\n        ]\n\n 41. Then for the next 4 days, we output:\n\n        day1: 2017-02-06, hours 0 to 23 -> avg[0] to avg[23]\n        day2: 2017-02-07, same\n        day3: 2017-02-08, same\n        day4: 2017-02-09, same\n\n 42. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format as string: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n            # the value = avg[i % 24]\n\n 43. But we are not actually coding, we are writing the output.\n\n 44. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 45. Let's do it step by step for the first day and then repeat.\n\n 46. We must be precise.\n\n 47. Write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 48. We'll generate the data:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-06\n        Day 2: 2017-02-07\n        Day 3: 2017-02-08\n        Day 4: 2017-02-09\n\n 49. We output:\n\n        2017-02-06 00:00:00 -1.558\n        2017-02-06 01:00:00 -1.791\n        2017-02-06 02:00:00 -1.892\n        2017-02-06 03:00:00 -1.992\n        2017-02-06 04:00:00 -2.026\n        2017-02-06 05:00:00 -2.059\n        2017-02-06 06:00:00 -2.026\n        2017-02-06 07:00:00 -1.774\n        2017-02-06 08:00:00 -1.206\n        2017-02-06 09:00:00 -1.424\n        2017-02-06 10:00:00 -1.390\n        2017-02-06 11:00:00 -1.290\n        2017-02-06 12:00:00 -1.357\n        2017-02-06 13:00:00 -1.206\n        2017-02-06 14:00:00 -1.055\n        2017-02-06 15:00:00 -1.156\n        2017-02-06 16:00:00 -1.156\n        2017-02-06 17:00:00 -1.340\n        2017-02-06 18:00:00 -1.423\n        2017-02-06 19:00:00 -0.804\n        2017-02-06 20:00:00 -0.419\n        2017-02-06 21:00:00 -0.503\n        2017-02-06 22:00:00 -0.854\n        2017-02-06 23:00:00 -1.323\n\n        Then the same for 2017-02-07 to 2017-02-09.\n\n 50. We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 51. Note: We are rounding to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 52. We are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are to provide complete data. We are not given any missing in the next 96, so we assume we can output without missing.\n\n Let's output the data.\n",
