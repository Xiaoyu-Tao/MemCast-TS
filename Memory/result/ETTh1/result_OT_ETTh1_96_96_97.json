        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days) of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-07-24 00:00:00 to 2017-07-27 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2017-07-28 00:00:00 to 2017-07-31 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also might have weekly patterns (but we only have 4 days, so weekly might not be captured).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. However, we are to be cautious for the future forecast.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since we are at hourly level and have daily seasonality, we can use SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing, but note that we have only 4 days of data.\n\n However, 4 days (96 points) is very short for training a model with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24). We might consider using a simple model that can capture the daily pattern.\n\n Approach:\n Given the short history, we can try to capture the daily pattern by averaging the same hour across the 4 days and then adjust with the last day's trend? \n But note: the data shows a pattern of temperature rising during the day and falling at night, but also there might be a slight trend over the 4 days? \n\n Let's check the overall trend by looking at the average of each day:\n Day1 (2017-07-24): min ~20.12, max ~25.61, average = (21.46+21.39+...+21.46)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n   We can see the values are around 20-26, and the average might be around 22.5? \n Day2: similar pattern, but let's see the last day (Day4) has a max of 25.25 and min of 19.63? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n   Since the pattern repeats daily, we can take the last day (2017-07-27) and use it as the base for the next day, but adjust by the average change from one day to the next at the same hour.\n\n However, we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). We can break it into 4 segments of 24 hours.\n\n Idea: \n   We can compute the average hourly profile from the 4 days and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n Steps for a simple model:\n   Let H(h) be the average of the temperature at hour h (0-23) over the 4 days.\n   But we also note that there might be a trend. We can compute the average temperature for each day and then the trend in the daily average.\n\n Daily averages (roughly):\n   Day1: 2017-07-24: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n   Day2: 2017-07-25: average\n   Day3: 2017-07-26: average\n   Day4: 2017-07-27: average\n\n Then we can compute the trend in the daily average and project it for the next 4 days.\n\n However, we have only 4 days, so we can use a linear regression for the daily average? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or just take the last day's average as the base and assume the same for the next days? \n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values.\n\n Let me compute the daily averages:\n\n Day1 (2017-07-24): \n   values: [21.456, 21.385, 21.245, 21.174, 20.682, 20.401, 20.119, 20.963, 22.3, 21.737, 21.948, 21.948, 22.581, 22.722, 23.988, 24.27, 25.044, 25.606, 24.129, 22.863, 22.23, 21.737, 21.456, 21.456]\n   average = (sum of these)/24 = 22.25 (approx)\n\n Day2 (2017-07-25): \n   values: [21.034, 20.612, 20.752, 20.471, 20.26, 19.838, 19.345, 20.26, 21.948, 22.159, 22.3, 22.581, 22.792, 23.637, 24.41, 25.395, 25.817, 25.958, 23.637, 22.37, 21.878, 21.245, 20.963, 21.456]\n   average = 22.25 (approx) [let me calculate: \n        sum = 21.034+20.612+20.752+20.471+20.26+19.838+19.345+20.26+21.948+22.159+22.3+22.581+22.792+23.637+24.41+25.395+25.817+25.958+23.637+22.37+21.878+21.245+20.963+21.456\n        = 534.0 -> 534/24 = 22.25]\n\n Day3 (2017-07-26): \n   values: [21.245, 21.245, 21.104, 20.471, 20.33, 19.627, 19.134, 19.205, 19.345, 20.119, 20.19, 20.823, 21.385, 22.089, 23.637, 24.621, 25.747, 24.27, 23.285, 21.878, 21.526, 21.034, 20.752, 21.034]\n   average = (21.245*2 + 21.104 + ... ) /24 -> let's compute: \n        sum = 21.245+21.245+21.104+20.471+20.33+19.627+19.134+19.205+19.345+20.119+20.19+20.823+21.385+22.089+23.637+24.621+25.747+24.27+23.285+21.878+21.526+21.034+20.752+21.034\n        = 516.0 -> 516/24 = 21.5\n\n Day4 (2017-07-27): \n   values: [20.823, 20.471, 20.612, 20.471, 20.19, 20.119, 19.627, 20.401, 21.034, 21.667, 21.808, 22.511, 23.355, 23.637, 24.41, 24.481, 25.255, 24.903, 23.848, 22.933, 22.441, 22.159, 21.878, 21.526]\n   average = (20.823+20.471+20.612+20.471+20.19+20.119+19.627+20.401+21.034+21.667+21.808+22.511+23.355+23.637+24.41+24.481+25.255+24.903+23.848+22.933+22.441+22.159+21.878+21.526)/24\n        = 22.25 (approx) [sum = 533.0 -> 533/24 = 22.208]\n\n So the daily averages: \n   2017-07-24: 22.25\n   2017-07-25: 22.25\n   2017-07-26: 21.5\n   2017-07-27: 22.208\n\n There is a dip on 2017-07-26. We don't see a clear trend. \n\n Given the short history and the volatility, we might assume that the daily average will be around the average of the last 4 days: (22.25+22.25+21.5+22.208)/4 = 22.052\n\n Now, for the hourly pattern, we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days. But note that the dip on day3 might be an outlier? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-07-27) as the base and then adjust by the overall level? \n\n However, we are to forecast 4 days. We can do:\n\n   Day5 (2017-07-28): use the hourly pattern of day4 (2017-07-27) but adjust by the overall level? \n   But we don't have a trend. \n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. \n\n Let me compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n   hour0: (21.456 + 21.034 + 21.245 + 20.823) / 4 = 21.1395\n   hour1: (21.385 + 20.612 + 21.245 + 20.471) / 4 = 20.92825\n   ... \n\n Then we can use these averages for each of the next 4 days? \n\n But note: the data shows that the pattern is similar but the level shifts. We can adjust the entire profile by the average of the last day? \n\n However, we are to forecast 4 days. We can use the same hourly pattern for each of the 4 days? \n\n Since we don't have a clear trend and the daily averages are fluctuating, we can use the average hourly profile for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   Compute the average for each of the 24 hours over the 4 days.\n   Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this average profile 4 times.\n\n But note: the last day (2017-07-27) had an average of 22.208, and the overall average of the 4 days is 22.052. \n   We can adjust the average profile by a factor? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average profile without adjustment.\n\n Let me compute the average profile:\n\n   hour0: (21.456 + 21.034 + 21.245 + 20.823) / 4 = 21.1395\n   hour1: (21.385 + 20.612 + 21.245 + 20.471) / 4 = 20.92825\n   hour2: (21.245 + 20.752 + 21.104 + 20.612) / 4 = 20.92825\n   hour3: (21.174 + 20.471 + 20.471 + 20.471) / 4 = 20.64675\n   hour4: (20.682 + 20.26 + 20.33 + 20.19) / 4 = 20.3655\n   hour5: (20.401 + 19.838 + 19.627 + 20.119) / 4 = 19.99625\n   hour6: (20.119 + 19.345 + 19.134 + 19.627) / 4 = 19.55625\n   hour7: (20.963 + 20.26 + 19.205 + 20.401) / 4 = 20.20725\n   hour8: (22.3 + 21.948 + 19.345 + 21.034) / 4 = 21.15675\n   hour9: (21.737 + 22.159 + 20.119 + 21.667) / 4 = 21.4205\n   hour10: (21.948 + 22.3 + 20.19 + 21.808) / 4 = 21.5615\n   hour11: (21.948 + 22.581 + 20.823 + 22.511) / 4 = 21.96575\n   hour12: (22.581 + 22.792 + 21.385 + 23.355) / 4 = 22.52825\n   hour13: (22.722 + 23.637 + 22.089 + 23.637) / 4 = 23.02125\n   hour14: (23.988 + 24.41 + 23.637 + 24.41) / 4 = 24.11125\n   hour15: (24.27 + 25.395 + 24.621 + 24.481) / 4 = 24.69175\n   hour16: (25.044 + 25.817 + 25.747 + 25.255) / 4 = 25.46575\n   hour17: (25.606 + 25.958 + 24.27 + 24.903) / 4 = 25.18425\n   hour18: (24.129 + 23.637 + 23.285 + 23.848) / 4 = 23.72475\n   hour19: (22.863 + 22.37 + 21.878 + 22.933) / 4 = 22.511\n   hour20: (22.23 + 21.878 + 21.526 + 22.441) / 4 = 22.01875\n   hour21: (21.737 + 21.245 + 21.034 + 22.159) / 4 = 21.54375\n   hour22: (21.456 + 20.963 + 20.752 + 21.878) / 4 = 21.26225\n   hour23: (21.456 + 21.456 + 21.034 + 21.526) / 4 = 21.368\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-07-28 to 2017-07-31) will be:\n\n   2017-07-28 00:00:00: 21.1395\n   2017-07-28 01:00:00: 20.92825\n   ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n   Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n However, we note that the average of this profile is (sum of the 24 averages)/24 = (sum of all 96 points)/96 = (22.25+22.25+21.5+22.208)*24/96 = (22.25+22.25+21.5+22.208)/4 = 22.052, which is the overall average.\n\n But the last day (2017-07-27) had an average of 22.208, which is above the overall average. \n   We might adjust the profile by a factor of (22.208 / 22.052) for the first forecast day? \n   But we don't have a clear trend, so we might not adjust.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day's average as the base for the next day? \n\n However, the problem does not clear about the trend. Since we are to forecast 4 days and we don't have a trend, we can use the average profile without adjustment.\n\n But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to capture weekly.\n\n Considering the above, we will use the average hourly profile for the next 4 days.\n\n However, we must output the data in the same format and with the same precision (3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n Let me round the numbers to 3 decimal places? But note the input has up to 6 decimal places? Actually, the input has 3 decimal places for the fractional part? \n\n Example: 21.455999 -> 21.456 (if rounded to 3 decimal places) but the input has 6. However, the problem does not specify precision. \n\n But the output should be in the same style. We can output with 6 decimal places? or 3? \n\n Since the input has 6, we can output with 6. But note the example: 21.455999, 21.385000 -> so we can output with 6.\n\n However, the average we computed is in double. We can output with 6 decimal places.\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must output 96 points.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We have computed 24 hourly averages (for hour0 to hour23) for the 4 days.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we have:\n\n      Day1: 2017-07-28: hour0 to hour23: the 24 averages we computed.\n      Day2: 2017-07-29: same 24 averages.\n      Day3: 2017-07-30: same 24 averages.\n      Day4: 2017-07-31: same 24 averages.\n\n   However, we must generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-07-28 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-07-27 23:00:00)\n      Then 2017-07-28 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-31 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 4*24 = 96 hours.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates and the corresponding average for that hour.\n\n   The 24 averages (hour0 to hour23) are:\n\n        hour0: 21.1395\n        hour1: 20.92825\n        hour2: 20.92825   # note: we computed two hours as 20.92825? Actually, let me check:\n\n        hour0: (21.456+21.034+21.245+20.823)/4 = 84.558/4 = 21.1395\n        hour1: (21.385+20.612+21.245+20.471)/4 = 83.713/4 = 20.92825\n        hour2: (21.245+20.752+21.104+20.612)/4 = 83.713/4 = 20.92825 -> same as hour1? \n        But the numbers are different: \n            day1:21.245, day2:20.752, day3:21.104, day4:20.612 -> 21.245+20.752=41.997, 21.104+20.612=41.716 -> total 83.713 -> 20.92825\n\n   So we have:\n\n        h0: 21.1395\n        h1: 20.92825\n        h2: 20.92825\n        h3: (21.174+20.471+20.471+20.471) = 82.587/4 = 20.64675\n        h4: (20.682+20.26+20.33+20.19) = 81.462/4 = 20.3655\n        h5: (20.401+19.838+19.627+20.119) = 79.985/4 = 19.99625\n        h6: (20.119+19.345+19.134+19.627) = 78.225/4 = 19.55625\n        h7: (20.963+20.26+19.205+20.401) = 80.829/4 = 20.20725\n        h8: (22.3+21.948+19.345+21.034) = 84.627/4 = 21.15675\n        h9: (21.737+22.159+20.119+21.667) = 85.682/4 = 21.4205\n        h10: (21.948+22.3+20.19+21.808) = 86.246/4 = 21.5615\n        h11: (21.948+22.581+20.823+22.511) = 87.863/4 = 21.96575\n        h12: (22.581+22.792+21.385+23.355) = 90.113/4 = 22.52825\n        h13: (22.722+23.637+22.089+23.637) = 92.085/4 = 23.02125\n        h14: (23.988+24.41+23.637+24.41) = 96.445/4 = 24.11125\n        h15: (24.27+25.395+24.621+24.481) = 98.767/4 = 24.69175\n        h16: (25.044+25.817+25.747+25.255) = 101.863/4 = 25.46575\n        h17: (25.606+25.958+24.27+24.903) = 100.737/4 = 25.18425\n        h18: (24.129+23.637+23.285+23.848) = 94.899/4 = 23.72475\n        h19: (22.863+22.37+21.878+22.933) = 90.044/4 = 22.511\n        h20: (22.23+21.878+21.526+22.441) = 88.075/4 = 22.01875\n        h21: (21.737+21.245+21.034+22.159) = 86.175/4 = 21.54375\n        h22: (21.456+20.963+20.752+21.878) = 85.049/4 = 21.26225\n        h23: (21.456+21.456+21.034+21.526) = 85.472/4 = 21.368\n\n   We'll use these 24 values and repeat them for 4 days.\n\n   We output the data in the format:\n\n        date                OT\n        2017-07-28 00:00:00 21.139500\n        2017-07-28 01:00:00 20.928250\n        ...\n\n   We must output 96 rows.\n\n Let's code the output.\n\n However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given?

We are to provide 96 points without missing values.\n\n We'll generate the next 96 points.\n\n Steps for generating the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-07-28 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 2017-07-31 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 4 days: 28,29,30,31 of July.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017,7,28,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            if i < 24:\n                hour_index = i\n            elif i < 48:\n                hour_index = i - 24\n            elif i < 72:\n                hour_index = i - 48\n            else:\n                hour_index = i - 72\n\n        But we can use modulo: hour_index = i % 24\n\n   Then the OT value for that hour_index is the average we computed for that hour.\n\n   We output the date string in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   And the OT value with 6 decimal places (as in the input).\n\n But note: the input has mixed: some have 3, some have 6? \n        e.g., 21.455999, 21.385000 -> so we can format to 6 decimal places.\n\n   We can format the OT as: \"{:.6f}\".format(value)\n\n However, note that the computed averages might have more than 6 decimal places? We round to 6.\n\n But we computed with double, so we can round to 6.\n\n Alternatively, we can use: \n        formatted_ot = format(value, '.6f')\n\n But note: the input has trailing zeros? We output with 6 decimal places.\n\n Let me write the 96 points:\n\n   We have 24 base values (for hour0 to hour23) as above.\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 base values (with 6 decimal formatting) and then repeat 4 times.\n\n   The base values:\n\n        h0: 21.1395 -> 21.139500\n        h1: 20.92825 -> 20.928250\n        h2: 20.92825 -> 20.928250\n        h3: 20.64675 -> 20.646750\n        h4: 20.3655 -> 20.365500\n        h5: 19.99625 -> 19.996250\n        h6: 19.55625 -> 19.556250\n        h7: 20.20725 -> 20.207250\n        h8: 21.15675 -> 21.156750\n        h9: 21.4205 -> 21.420500\n        h10: 21.5615 -> 21.561500\n        h11: 21.96575 -> 21.965750\n        h12: 22.52825 -> 22.528250\n        h13: 23.02125 -> 23.021250\n        h14: 24.11125 -> 24.111250\n        h15: 24.69175 -> 24.691750\n        h16: 25.46575 -> 25.465750\n        h17: 25.18425 -> 25.184250\n        h18: 23.72475 -> 23.724750\n        h19: 22.511 -> 22.511000   (because 22.511 * 1 = 22.511 -> we can represent as 22.511000)\n        h20: 22.01875 -> 22.018750\n        h21: 21.54375 -> 21.543750\n        h22: 21.26225 -> 21.262250\n        h23: 21.368 -> 21.368000   (because 21.368 * 1 = 21.368 -> 21.368000)\n\n   But wait: h19: 22.511 -> we computed as 22.044/4? Actually we computed 90.044/4=22.511 -> so it's 22.511 exactly? \n        But 90.044/4 = 22.511 -> so we can write 22.511000.\n\n   Similarly, h23: 85.472/4 = 21.368 -> so 21.368000.\n\n   We'll create a list:\n\n        base_OT = [21.1395, 20.92825, 20.92825, 20.64675, 20.3655, 19.99625, 19.55625, 20.20725, 21.15675, 21.4205, 21.5615, 21.96575, 22.52825, 23.02125, 24.11125, 24.69175, 25.46575, 25.18425, 23.72475, 22.511, 22.01875, 21.54375, 21.26225, 21.368]\n\n   Then for each day in 4 days, we output base_OT repeated.\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        day0: 2017-07-28\n        day1: 2017-07-29\n        day2: 2017-07-30\n        day3: 2017-07-31\n\n   For each day, we have 24 hours.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # but note: we are starting at 2017-07-28 00:00:00, then 2017-07-28 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00, then 2017-07-29 00:00:00, etc.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            start = datetime(2017,7,28,0,0,0)\n            for i in range(96):\n                current = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n                ot = base_OT[i % 24]\n\n   Then format the date as string: current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n   And ot formatted to 6 decimal places: \"{:.6f}\".format(ot)\n\n But note: the base_OT values are floats, and we want to output with 6 decimal places.\n\n However, we computed the base_OT with more precision? We can use the exact value and then format to 6.\n\n But note: the input has values like 21.455999 -> which is 21.456 rounded to 3 decimal places? \n   We are using the average, so we are losing the original precision. But that's acceptable.\n\n Let's output.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We are providing 96 rows.\n\n We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n Example of the first few rows:\n\n        2017-07-28 00:00:00 21.139500\n        2017-07-28 01:00:00 20.928250\n        2017-07-28 02:00:00 20.928250\n        2017-07-28 03:00:00 20.646750\n        ...\n\n We'll generate the entire 96 rows.\n\n Let me code the output in the answer block.\n\n Note: We are not using a sophisticated forecasting model because of the very short history. \n   This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n If we had more data, we would use SARIMA or LSTM, but 4 days is too short for that.\n\n Let's write the answer.\n",
