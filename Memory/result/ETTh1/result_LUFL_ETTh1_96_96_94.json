        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low Useful Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The data starts at 2017-07-12 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to  Steps:\n  1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might be harder to capture).\n  2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast should account for the possibility of missing values in the future? \n     But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". \n     However, the provided 96 points do not have any missing values. So we assume that the provided history is complete? \n     the instruction: \"But please note that these data will have missing values\" might refer to the fact that in the original dataset there are missing values, but the provided 96 points are without gaps? \n     Since we are only given 96 points and they are consecutive without missing, we can proceed.\n\n  3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series model that can capture seasonality.\n\n  Approach:\n  Given the hourly data and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model. Since we are only given 4 days, we can use:\n      - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components (trend, seasonality, residual) but with only 4 days, trend might be flat.\n      - Alternatively, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n  However, note that we are only given 4 days (96 points) and we are to forecast 4 days (96 points). The data shows:\n      - Daily peaks in the evening (around 20:00) and lower values during the night and morning.\n      - The values on the weekend (15th July is a Saturday) show a slightly different pattern? But we don't have enough for weekly seasonality.\n\n  Given the small data, we can use a simple seasonal model. We'll use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n  Steps in code (if we were to code) but since we are to provide the forecast without coding, we must reason:\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: \n      - The last 4 days of data: we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n      But that would be the same for each day. However, we note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) might be different? \n      But we only have one Saturday (15th) and one Sunday (16th is the next day we are forecasting for, but we don't have history for Sunday?).\n\n  Actually, the data we have:\n      12th July: Wednesday\n      13th: Thursday\n      14th: Friday\n      15th: Saturday\n\n  We are to forecast:\n      16th: Sunday\n      17th: Monday\n      18th: Tuesday\n      19th: Wednesday\n\n  We don't have any Sunday in the history, so we cannot use a weekly seasonal pattern. Therefore, we might rely on the daily pattern.\n\n  Proposed method:\n      We will take the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days we have, and then adjust by the overall trend? \n      But we don't have a strong trend in 4 days.\n\n  However, looking at the data, the daily pattern is similar but the magnitude varies. For example, the peak on Saturday (15th) is higher than the others.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the base and then adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n  Given the problem constraints and the fact that we are to provide the forecast, we choose a simple method:\n\n      We will compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days, and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n  But note: the next 4 days include Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We don't have Sunday and Monday in the history? \n  However, without more data, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. So we assume the daily pattern is consistent.\n\n  Steps for the average method:\n      Group by hour (i.e., for hour 0: the values at 00:00:00 on 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th) and average.\n\n  The values for hour 0:\n      2017-07-12 00:00:00: 3.198\n      2017-07-13 00:00:00: 3.990\n      2017-07-14 00:00:00: 4.295\n      2017-07-15 00:00:00: 4.051\n      Average: (3.198+3.990+4.295+4.051)/4 = 3.8835\n\n  Similarly for each hour.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told that the provided 96 points have missing, so we assume they are complete.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" meaning in the entire dataset? But we are only given 96 points without missing? \n  We'll proceed with the average.\n\n  But let's check: the data we are given is 96 points without missing? Yes.\n\n  So we can compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n      Day1 (2017-07-16, Sunday: hour0 to hour23): the 24 averages we computed.\n      Day2 (2017-07-17, Monday): same 24 averages.\n      Day3 (2017-07-18, Tuesday): same 24 averages.\n      Day4 (2017-07-19, Wednesday): same 24 averages.\n\n  However, we note that the average might smooth out the pattern and we lose the day-to-day variation. But without more data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the pattern for Sunday? But we don't know if Sunday is similar to Saturday? \n  Since we don't have any Sunday, we stick to the average.\n\n  Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n  We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n  But note: the data we have is for 4 consecutive days, so we have 4 values for each hour.\n\n  We'll compute:\n\n      hour0: [3.198, 3.990, 4.295, 4.051] -> 3.8835\n      hour1: [3.015, 3.777, 3.746, 3.899] -> (3.015+3.777+3.746+3.899)/4 = 3.60925\n      hour2: [3.137, 3.533, 3.625, 3.716] -> (3.137+3.533+3.625+3.716)/4 = 3.50275\n      hour3: [2.985, 3.350, 3.046, 3.381] -> (2.985+3.350+3.046+3.381)/4 = 3.1905\n      hour4: [2.741, 2.924, 3.229, 3.411] -> (2.741+2.924+3.229+3.411)/4 = 3.07625\n      hour5: [3.746, 3.503, 3.381, 3.838] -> (3.746+3.503+3.381+3.838)/4 = 3.617\n      hour6: [3.503, 3.716, 3.533, 4.051] -> (3.503+3.716+3.533+4.051)/4 = 3.70075\n      hour7: [3.503, 3.411, 3.472, 3.533] -> (3.503+3.411+3.472+3.533)/4 = 3.47975\n      hour8: [3.381, 3.564, 3.503, 3.838] -> (3.381+3.564+3.503+3.838)/4 = 3.5715\n      hour9: [3.259, 3.442, 3.625, 4.112] -> (3.259+3.442+3.625+4.112)/4 = 3.6095\n      hour10: [3.320, 4.173, 4.295, 3.990] -> (3.320+4.173+4.295+3.990)/4 = 3.9445\n      hour11: [3.564, 3.807, 4.142, 4.082] -> (3.564+3.807+4.142+4.082)/4 = 3.89875\n      hour12: [3.533, 3.503, 3.899, 3.899] -> (3.533+3.503+3.899+3.899)/4 = 3.7085\n      hour13: [3.716, 3.564, 4.082, 4.234] -> (3.716+3.564+4.082+4.234)/4 = 3.899\n      hour14: [3.564, 3.472, 4.447, 4.173] -> (3.564+3.472+4.447+4.173)/4 = 3.914\n      hour15: [3.472, 3.381, 4.142, 4.295] -> (3.472+3.381+4.142+4.295)/4 = 3.8225\n      hour16: [3.503, 3.442, 4.234, 4.082] -> (3.503+3.442+4.234+4.082)/4 = 3.81525\n      hour17: [3.990, 3.899, 4.295, 3.777] -> (3.990+3.899+4.295+3.777)/4 = 3.99025\n      hour18: [3.686, 3.807, 4.082, 3.868] -> (3.686+3.807+4.082+3.868)/4 = 3.86075\n      hour19: [4.082, 4.082, 4.904, 4.508] -> (4.082+4.082+4.904+4.508)/4 = 4.394\n      hour20: [5.544, 5.513, 6.275, 6.457] -> (5.544+5.513+6.275+6.457)/4 = 5.94725\n      hour21: [5.483, 5.178, 5.726, 6.396] -> (5.483+5.178+5.726+6.396)/4 = 5.69575\n      hour22: [5.117, 5.117, 5.391, 5.757] -> (5.117+5.117+5.391+5.757)/4 = 5.3455\n      hour23: [4.508, 4.660, 4.873, 4.904] -> (4.508+4.660+4.873+4.904)/4 = 4.73625\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00) will be:\n\n      2017-07-16 00:00:00: 3.8835\n      2017-07-16 01:00:00: 3.60925\n      ... and so on for the 24 hours of July 16.\n\n      Then repeat the same 24 numbers for July 17, 18, July19.\n\n  However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating a forecast without missing. \n  We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" meaning we must not omit any of the 96 forecasted points.\n\n  We'll generate the next 96 timestamps and the corresponding LUFL values.\n\n  Timestamps: \n      Start: 2017-07-16 00:00:00 (the last given was 2017-07-15 23:00:00, so next is 16th at 00:00:00)\n      Then 2017-07-16 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n\n  We have 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n  We'll write the forecasted values as the average we computed for each hour, repeated for each day.\n\n  However, note: the average we computed is from 4 days that are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. \n  The next days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. \n  We might be better to use a model that can account for the day of the week? But we don't have enough data for that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day? But we only have one week? and the days don't align.\n\n  Given the constraints, we stick to the average.\n\n  But note: the problem says we are an expert and we should use a proper method. \n  Another method: use a simple moving average of the last 4 points for the same hour? \n  We have 4 days, so we can do that. Actually, that's what we did.\n\n  We'll output the forecast in the required format.\n\n  However, we must round the numbers? The original data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n  Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n      hour0: round((3.198+3.990+4.295+4.051)/4, 3) = round(15.534/4,3) = round(3.8835,3) -> 3.884\n      hour1: (3.015+3.777+3.746+3.899)=14.437 -> 14.437/4=3.60925 -> 3.609\n      hour2: (3.137+3.533+3.625+3.716)=14.011 -> 14.011/4=3.50275 -> 3.503\n      hour3: (2.985+3.350+3.046+3.381)=12.762 -> 12.762/4=3.1905 -> 3.191\n      hour4: (2.741+2.924+3.229+3.411)=12.305 -> 12.305/4=3.07625 -> 3.076\n      hour5: (3.746+3.503+3.381+3.838)=14.468 -> 14.468/4=3.617 -> 3.617\n      hour6: (3.503+3.716+3.533+4.051)=14.803 -> 14.803/4=3.70075 -> 3.701\n      hour7: (3.503+3.411+3.472+3.533)=13.919 -> 13.919/4=3.47975 -> 3.480\n      hour8: (3.381+3.564+3.503+3.838)=14.286 -> 14.286/4=3.5715 -> 3.572\n      hour9: (3.259+3.442+3.625+4.112)=14.438 -> 14.438/4=3.6095 -> 3.610\n      hour10: (3.320+4.173+4.295+3.990)=15.778 -> 15.778/4=3.9445 -> 3.945\n      hour11: (3.564+3.807+4.142+4.082)=15.595 -> 15.595/4=3.89875 -> 3.899\n      hour12: (3.533+3.503+3.899+3.899)=14.834 -> 14.834/4=3.7085 -> 3.709\n      hour13: (3.716+3.564+4.082+4.234)=15.596 -> 15.596/4=3.899 -> 3.899\n      hour14: (3.564+3.472+4.447+4.173)=15.656 -> 15.656/4=3.914 -> 3.914\n      hour15: (3.472+3.381+4.142+4.295)=15.290 -> 15.290/4=3.8225 -> 3.823\n      hour16: (3.503+3.442+4.234+4.082)=15.261 -> 15.261/4=3.81525 -> 3.815\n      hour17: (3.990+3.899+4.295+3.777)=15.961 -> 15.961/4=3.99025 -> 3.990\n      hour18: (3.686+3.807+4.082+3.868)=15.443 -> 15.443/4=3.86075 -> 3.861\n      hour19: (4.082+4.082+4.904+4.508)=17.576 -> 17.576/4=4.394 -> 4.394\n      hour20: (5.544+5.513+6.275+6.457)=23.789 -> 23.789/4=5.94725 -> 5.947\n      hour21: (5.483+5.178+5.726+6.396)=22.783 -> 22.783/4=5.69575 -> 5.696\n      hour22: (5.117+5.117+5.391+5.757)=21.382 -> 21.382/4=5.3455 -> 5.346\n      hour23: (4.508+4.660+4.873+4.904)=18.945 -> 18.945/4=4.73625 -> 4.736\n\n  Now, we'll create the next 96 timestamps and assign the corresponding hour value.\n\n  The first day (2017-07-16, Sunday) will have:\n      00:00:00 -> 3.884\n      01:00:00 -> 3.609\n      02:00:00 -> 3.503\n      ... until 23:00:00 -> 4.736\n\n  The second day (2017-07-17, Monday): same 24 numbers.\n  The third day (2017-07-18, Tuesday): same 24 numbers.\n  The fourth day (2017-07-19, Wednesday): same 24 numbers.\n\n  We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes?
