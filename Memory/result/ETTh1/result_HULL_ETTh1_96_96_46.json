        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided data, we don't see any explicit missing values (like NaN). \n    However, we should be cautious. The provided data has 96 points without any gap in the timestamp? Let's check the timestamps: \n        They are consecutive hourly from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00 (exactly 4 days * 24 = 96 points). \n    So the provided data is complete? But the user warns that there might be missing values in the data we are going to forecast? \n    Actually, the user says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n    This might mean that the provided data might have missing values? But in the given sample, we don't see any. \n\n    However, to be safe, we should check for missing timestamps in the provided data? \n        The timestamps are consecutive and complete for 96 points.\n\n 2. We are to provide the next 96 points. We must output the complete data for the next 96 dates (hourly) and the forecasted HULL values.\n\n 3. Approach for forecasting:\n    Since we are dealing with time series, we can use a model that can handle hourly data and possibly seasonality. \n    The data shows a daily pattern (24 hours) and we have 4 days of data. We can try to model the daily seasonality.\n\n    However, 4 days of data is very short for training a complex model. We might use:\n        - Simple methods like moving average, exponential smoothing, or \n        - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components.\n\n    But note: the data has negative values and does not look like it has a strong trend. It seems to have daily seasonality.\n\n    We can use a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day? \n        For example, the value at 2017-01-05 00:00:00 would be the same as 2017-01-04 00:00:00? \n        But 2017-01-04 00:00:00 is -0.201, so we would forecast -0.201 for 2017-01-05 00:00:00.\n\n    However, we have 4 days of data. We could average the same hour over the past 4 days? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) or an ARIMA model with seasonality.\n\n    But note: the data is only 96 points. We can try a simple seasonal model.\n\n    Since the data is very short, we can use the last available day (day 4) as the pattern for the next day? \n        But the pattern might change? \n\n    Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the available days? \n\n    Let's try to compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n        Hour 00: (1.273, -0.402, 1.139, -0.201) -> average = (1.273 -0.402 + 1.139 -0.201)/4 = (1.809)/4 = 0.45225\n        Hour 01: (1.674, -0.402, 1.340, 0.201) -> (1.674 -0.402+1.340+0.201)/4 = 2.813/4 = 0.70325\n        ... \n\n    But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all in the same week?).\n\n    However, the user did not specify any weekly pattern and we only have 4 days, so we can only capture daily.\n\n    We can also consider that the data might be non-stationary? But with only 4 days, it's hard to tell.\n\n    Given the simplicity and the data length, we choose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Steps for forecasting:\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days we have.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign:\n            Day 5 (2017-01-05): use the average for hour 0, then hour 1, ... hour 23.\n            Day 6 (2017-01-06): same as day 5? But we are using the same daily pattern? \n            Actually, we are going to use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days? \n\n        But note: the next 4 days might be similar to the past 4 days? \n\n    However, we are only given 4 days and we are to forecast 4 days. So we can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    But wait: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day1: average of day1: (1.273+1.674+...+(-0.469))/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n        day1: positive in the first half, negative in the second? \n        day2: similar pattern? \n        day3: similar? \n        day4: similar?\n\n    We can compute the daily average to see if there's a trend:\n\n        Day1: \n            positive: 1.273,1.674,1.407,1.942,2.076,1.674,1.206,1.072,1.005,0.402,0.670,0.670 -> 12 positive\n            negative: -0.871,0,0.134,0, -0.737,-1.273,-1.340,-1.608,-1.541,-1.875,-0.469,-0.469 -> 12 negative? \n            Actually, let's compute the average = (sum of all)/24.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        Day1: \n            sum = 1.273+1.674+1.407+1.942+2.076+1.674+1.206+1.072+1.005+0.402+0.670+0.670 -0.871+0+0.134+0 -0.737-1.273-1.340-1.608-1.541-1.875-0.469-0.469\n            = (positive part: 1.273+1.674+1.407+1.942+2.076+1.674+1.206+1.072+1.005+0.402+0.670+0.670) = 15.171\n            negative part: -0.871 -0.737 -1.273 -1.340 -1.608 -1.541 -1.875 -0.469 -0.469 = -10.183\n            zeros: 0+0+0+0.134? -> 0.134\n            total = 15.171 -10.183 + 0.134 = 5.122\n            average = 5.122/24 = 0.2134\n\n        Day2: \n            positive: -0.402,-0.402,-0.134,0,0.067,0,0,0.335,0.201,0.335,0,0,0, -0.737,-0.804,-0.804,-1.072,-1.139,-1.608,0.067,0.603\n            Actually, let me list all 24:\n                [-0.402, -0.402, -0.134, 0, 0.067, -0.201, -1.340, 0, 0, 0.335, 0.201, 0.335, -0.603, 0, 0, 0, -0.737, -0.804, -0.804, -1.072, -1.139, -1.608, 0.067, 0.603]\n            positive: 0.067, 0.335, 0.201, 0.335, 0, 0, 0.067, 0.603 -> but note: zeros are neutral. \n            negative: -0.402, -0.402, -0.134, -0.201, -1.340, -0.603, -0.737, -0.804, -0.804, -1.072, -1.139, -1.608\n            sum = positive: 0.067+0.335+0.201+0.335+0.067+0.603 = 1.608\n            negative: -0.402-0.402-0.134-0.201-1.340-0.603-0.737-0.804-0.804-1.072-1.139-1.608 = -9.246\n            zeros: 0+0+0+0 at 4 positions? -> 0\n            total = 1.608 - 9.246 = -7.638\n            average = -7.638/24 = -0.31825\n\n        Day3: \n            [1.139,1.340,1.206,1.474,1.608,1.005,0.268,0.938,1.407,0.536,0.603,0,-0.603,-0.201,-0.067,-0.067,-1.139,-0.737,-1.005,-0.871,-1.005,-1.741,-0.737,0.536]\n            positive: 1.139,1.340,1.206,1.474,1.608,1.005,0.268,0.938,1.407,0.536,0.603,0.536 -> 12 values? \n            negative: -0.603,-0.201,-0.067,-0.067,-1.139,-0.737,-1.005,-0.871,-1.005,-1.741,-0.737 -> 11 values? and one zero?\n            Actually, the 12th hour is 0? \n            positive sum: 1.139+1.340+1.206+1.474+1.608+1.005+0.268+0.938+1.407+0.536+0.603+0.536 = 12.06\n            negative sum: -0.603-0.201-0.067-0.067-1.139-0.737-1.005-0.871-1.005-1.741-0.737 = -8.173\n            zero: one zero -> 0\n            total = 12.06 -8.173 = 3.887\n            average = 3.887/24 = 0.16196\n\n        Day4:\n            [-0.201,0.201,-0.201,0.335,-0.067,0.201,0,0.871,1.875,0.402,0,-0.134,-0.871,-0.603,-0.134,0.067,-0.871,-1.005,-1.407,-1.005,-1.139,-1.273,0.134,0.737]\n            positive: 0.201,0.335,0.201,0.871,1.875,0.402,0.067,0.134,0.737 -> 9 values\n            negative: -0.201,-0.201,-0.067, -0.134,-0.871,-0.603,-0.134,-0.871,-1.005,-1.407,-1.005,-1.139,-1.273 -> 13 values? \n            zeros: 0,0 -> two zeros?\n            positive sum: 0.201+0.335+0.201+0.871+1.875+0.402+0.067+0.134+0.737 = 4.823\n            negative sum: -0.201-0.201-0.067-0.134-0.871-0.603-0.134-0.871-1.005-1.407-1.005-1.139-1.273 = -8.902\n            total = 4.823 -8.902 = -4.079\n            average = -4.079/24 = -0.16996\n\n    The daily averages: [0.2134, -0.31825, 0.16196, -0.16996] -> no clear trend? \n\n    Therefore, we can assume the daily pattern is stable and use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n    How to compute the average for hour 0:\n        Day1: 1.273\n        Day2: -0.402\n        Day3: 1.139\n        Day4: -0.201\n        average_hour0 = (1.273 -0.402 + 1.139 -0.201)/4 = (1.809)/4 = 0.45225\n\n    But note: the data might have a weekly pattern?
