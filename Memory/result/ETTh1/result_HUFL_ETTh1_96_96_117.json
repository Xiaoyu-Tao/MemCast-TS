        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-10-16 00:00:00 to 2017-10-19 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 points, but we are to forecast the next 96.\n 2. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily pattern (as seen in the data, there are peaks and troughs during the day).\n 3. We can use a time series model. Given the data size (96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we can consider models like:\n    - Seasonal ARIMA (since we have clear daily seasonality, which is 24 hours)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality)\n    - Or a simple approach: using the average of the last few days for the same hour.\n\n However, note that the data shows some non-stationarity and the seasonality might be changing.\n\n 4. Since we are to provide a complete forecast for the next 96 points, we must generate 96 values.\n\n Approach chosen:\n We'll use a simple but effective method: seasonal naive forecasting. \n Why? Because the data has a strong daily pattern (24-hour seasonality). We can take the value from the same hour of the previous day.\n\n But note: we have 4 days of data (96 hours). For the next day (2017-10-16) we can use the values from 2017-10-15 (the last day) as the forecast.\n\n However, let's look at the pattern:\n\n  2017-10-12: day0\n  2017-10-13: day1\n  2017-10-14: day2\n  2017-10-15: day3 (last day)\n\n For the next (2017-10-16, which is day4), we can use the values from day3 (2017-10-15) for the same hour.\n\n But what about the next day (2017-10-17)? We don't have day4 to use. So we can use the same hour of the last available day (day3) again? \n However, that would be the same as day3. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the 96 points. \n But we are to be cautious. However, for forecasting, we can use the last available day for the next day.\n\n However, let's see the pattern: the data from 2017-10-15 (day3) is:\n\n 00:00: 10.181\n 01:00: 10.851\n ... \n 23:00: 10.583\n\n We can use these 24 values for the next day (2017-10-16). Then for 2017-10-17, we can use the same 24 values again? \n But that would be repeating the same day. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n However, the data shows that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. \n\n Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n   For the first 24 hours (2017-10-16 00:00 to 2017-10-16 23:00): use the values from 2017-10-15 (the last day) for the same hour.\n\n   For the next 24 hours (2017-10-17 00:00 to 2017-10-17 23:00): use the values from 2017-10-14? or the average of the same hour over the last 4 days?\n\n But note: we have only 4 days. We can compute the average for each hour over the 4 days? \n\n However, the data might have a trend? Let's check the last 4 days at 00:00:\n\n   2017-10-12 00:00:00  7.301\n   2017-10-13 00:00:00 10.583\n   2017-10-14 00:00:00 10.784\n   2017-10-15 00:00:00 10.181\n\n The average for 00:00: (7.301+10.583+10.784+10.181)/4 = 9.71225\n\n But note: the value on 2017-10-12 is much lower. Maybe because it's the first day? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-10-15) for the entire next 4 days? But that would be 4 repetitions of the same day.\n\n However, the problem does not to omit any content and we must provide 96 points.\n\n Considering the above, I propose:\n\n   We use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days for the next 4 days? But that would be the same 24 values repeated 4 times? \n   Actually, no: for each hour in the day, we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days, and then use that average for that hour in every day? \n\n   But that would lose the daily pattern? Actually, we would have a daily pattern, but it would be the average pattern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      Day1 (2017-10-16): use the values from 2017-10-15 (the last day)\n      Day2 (2017-10-17): use the values from 2017-10-14\n      Day3 (2017-10-18): use the values from 2017-10-13\n      Day4 (2017-10-19): use the values from 2017-10-12\n\n   But note: the data from 2017-10-12 is the first day and might be different? \n\n   However, we have to provide 96 points. We have 4 days of history (each 24 hours). We can use:\n\n       2017-10-16: 2017-10-15's data\n       2017-10-17: 2017-10-14's data\n       2017-10-18: 2017-10-13's data\n       2017-10-19: 2017-10-12's data\n\n   But note: the dates are increasing. We are going backwards? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average for each hour? \n\n   Let me compute the average for each hour over the 4 days:\n\n        hour0: (7.301 + 10.583 + 10.784 + 10.181) / 4 = 9.71225\n        hour1: (6.363 + 11.320 + 10.583 + 10.851) / 4 = 9.77925\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then we use these 24 average values for each day of the forecast? \n\n   But note: the data might have a trend? The last day (2017-10-15) is the most recent and might be more representative.\n\n   Considering the trade-off, I choose to use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days for the next 4 days? \n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days, we use that average for the corresponding hour.\n\n   This will give a stable pattern.\n\n   However, let's see: the data has a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to know. But 4 days is not a week.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? More weight to the recent days? \n\n   Since we have to provide the data and the method is not specified, I choose the simple average.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23). We have 4 values for each hour.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the mean for each hour.\n\n        Step 3: For the next 96 hours (4 days), assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   Example:\n\n        For 2017-10-16 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.71225\n        For 2017-10-16 01:00:00 -> hour1: 9.77925\n        ... and so on.\n\n        Then for 2017-10-17 00:00:00 -> again hour0: 9.71225\n\n   This will repeat the same 24 values for the 4 days.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? We are not missing in the provided, but for forecasting we are generating.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\" - meaning the provided data? \n   But the provided data we have is complete. So we are safe.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n   We are not told that the next 96 will have missing? We are to generate the complete 96.\n\n   So we generate 96 points without missing.\n\n 5. Implementation:\n\n        We'll create a list of the 4 days of data (each day 24 hours). Then for each hour in the day (0-23), we compute the mean.\n\n        Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating the 24 mean values 4 times.\n\n 6. Let's compute the mean for each hour:\n\n        We have 4 days: \n          day0: 2017-10-12 (index 0 to 23)\n          day1: 2017-10-13 (index 24 to 47)\n          day2: 2017-10-14 (index 48 to 71)\n          day3: 2017-10-15 (index 72 to 95)\n\n        For hour0 (00:00): \n            values: [7.301, 10.583, 10.784, 10.181] -> mean = (7.301+10.583+10.784+10.181)/4 = 38.849/4 = 9.71225\n\n        For hour1 (01:00):\n            values: [6.363, 11.320, 10.583, 10.851] -> (6.363+11.320+10.583+10.851)=39.117 -> 9.77925\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 7. We'll compute all 24 hourly means.\n\n 8. Then we create the next 96 points:\n\n        The next day starts at 2017-10-16 00:00:00 and goes to 2017-10-16 23:00:00 -> use the 24 means in order.\n        Then 2017-10-17 00:00:00 to 2017-10-17 23:00:00 -> same 24 means again.\n        Then 2017-10-18 and 2017-10-19.\n\n 9. Format the answer: \n        We must output the date and the forecasted HUFL value.\n\n        The dates: \n          2017-10-16 00:00:00 to 2017-10-19 23:00:00\n\n        We'll generate the dates in hourly frequency.\n\n 10. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        last_date = datetime(2017, 15, 10) -> but the last date in the data is 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n\n        Actually, the last point is 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n\n        Then next date: 2017-10-16 00:00:00.\n\n        We can generate:\n\n          start_date = datetime(2017, 10, 16, 0, 0, 0)\n          then add 96 hours.\n\n 11. But note: the format of the date string: \"2017-10-12 00:00:00\"\n\n 12. We'll generate the next 96 dates:\n\n        dates = []\n        current = datetime(2017, 10,16,0,0,0) -> wait, the last date was 2017-10-15, so next day is 2017-10-16.\n\n        Actually, the last date in the input is 2017-10-15 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-10-16 00:00:00.\n\n        We'll generate 96 hours from 2017-10-16 00:00:00.\n\n 13. Steps in code (but we are not coding, we are writing the output):\n\n        We'll compute the 24 means manually? \n\n        But 24 is manageable? We can do it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write a small program? But we are to provide the answer in the box.\n\n        Since the problem requires the complete data, we must compute the 24 means and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 14. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): [7.301, 10.583, 10.784, 10.181] -> 7.301+10.583=17.884; 17.884+10.784=28.668; 28.668+10.181=38.849 -> 38.849/4 = 9.71225\n        Hour 1 (01:00): [6.363, 11.320, 10.583, 10.851] -> 6.363+11.320=17.683; 17.683+10.583=28.266; 28.266+10.851=39.117 -> 39.117/4 = 9.77925\n        Hour 2 (02:00): [6.966, 10.449, 10.516, 9.243] -> 6.966+10.449=17.415; 17.415+10.516=27.931; 27.931+9.243=37.174 -> 37.174/4 = 9.2935\n        Hour 3 (03:00): [6.095, 9.243, 11.387, 10.449] -> 6.095+9.243=15.338; 15.338+11.387=26.725; 26.725+10.449=37.174 -> 37.174/4 = 9.2935\n        Wait, note: the hour3 for day0: 2017-10-12 03:00:00 -> 6.095\n                   day1: 2017-10-13 03:00:00 -> 9.243\n                   day2: 2017-10-14 03:00:00 -> 11.387\n                   day3: 2017-10-15 03:00:00 -> 10.449\n\n        So the values are [6.095, 9.243, 11.387, 10.449] -> sum=37.174 -> mean=9.2935\n\n        Hour 4 (04:00): [7.435, 9.444, 10.516, 10.985] -> 7.435+9.444=16.879; 16.879+10.516=27.395; 27.395+10.985=38.38 -> 38.38/4=9.595\n        Hour 5 (05:00): [7.569, 11.922, 11.588, 10.918] -> 7.569+11.922=19.491; 19.491+11.588=31.079; 31.079+10.918=41.997 -> 41.997/4=10.49925\n        Hour 6 (06:00): [8.439, 13.061, 11.922, 11.855] -> 8.439+13.061=21.5; 21.5+11.922=33.422; 33.422+11.855=45.277 -> 45.277/4=11.31925\n        Hour 7 (07:00): [9.243, 13.061, 14.200, 12.860] -> 9.243+13.061=22.304; 22.304+14.200=36.504; 36.504+12.860=49.364 -> 49.364/4=12.341\n        Hour 8 (08:00): [7.636, 7.904, 10.181, 8.908] -> 7.636+7.904=15.54; 15.54+10.181=25.721; 25.721+8.908=34.629 -> 34.629/4=8.65725\n        Hour 9 (09:00): [7.502, 3.885, 4.823, 7.837] -> 7.502+3.885=11.387; 11.387+4.823=16.21; 16.21+7.837=24.047 -> 24.047/4=6.01175\n        Hour10 (10:00): [7.703, 4.890, -0.670, 7.100] -> 7.703+4.890=12.593; 12.593-0.670=11.923; 11.923+7.100=19.023 -> 19.023/4=4.75575\n        Hour11 (11:00): [5.157, -2.143, -1.741, 3.751] -> 5.157-2.143=3.014; 3.014-1.741=1.273; 1.273+3.751=5.024 -> 5.024/4=1.256\n        Hour12 (12:00): [3.952, -1.608, 1.674, 3.550] -> 3.952-1.608=2.344; 2.344+1.674=4.018; 4.018+3.550=7.568 -> 7.568/4=1.892\n        Hour13 (13:00): [4.689, -5.023, 2.947, 3.483] -> 4.689-5.023=-0.334; -0.334+2.947=2.613; 2.613+3.483=6.096 -> 6.096/4=1.524\n        Hour14 (14:00): [3.148, -1.541, 3.483, 3.081] -> 3.148-1.541=1.607; 1.607+3.483=5.09; 5.09+3.081=8.171 -> 8.171/4=2.04275\n        Hour15 (15:00): [5.157, -0.201, 3.014, 4.957] -> 5.157-0.201=4.956; 4.956+3.014=7.97; 7.97+4.957=12.927 -> 12.927/4=3.23175\n        Hour16 (16:00): [5.894, 2.277, 5.693, 6.229] -> 5.894+2.277=8.171; 8.171+5.693=13.864; 13.864+6.229=20.093 -> 20.093/4=5.02325\n        Hour17 (17:00): [8.707, 7.167, 7.703, 7.368] -> 8.707+7.167=15.874; 15.874+7.703=23.577; 23.577+7.368=30.945 -> 30.945/4=7.73625\n        Hour18 (18:00): [7.033, 7.435, 7.435, 7.234] -> 7.033+7.435=14.468; 14.468+7.435=21.903; 21.903+7.234=29.137 -> 29.137/4=7.28425\n        Hour19 (19:00): [6.631, 7.100, 6.966, 7.234] -> 6.631+7.100=13.731; 13.731+6.966=20.697; 20.697+7.234=27.931 -> 27.931/4=6.98275\n        Hour20 (20:00): [5.961, 6.363, 6.497, 6.564] -> 5.961+6.363=12.324; 12.324+6.497=18.821; 18.821+6.564=25.385 -> 25.385/4=6.34625\n        Hour21 (21:00): [5.559, 6.095, 6.095, 5.760] -> 5.559+6.095=11.654; 11.654+6.095=17.749; 17.749+5.760=23.509 -> 23.509/4=5.87725\n        Hour22 (22:00): [9.310, 9.913, 9.444, 10.047] -> 9.310+9.913=19.223; 19.223+9.444=28.667; 28.667+10.047=38.714 -> 38.714/4=9.6785\n        Hour23 (23:00): [10.047, 11.922, 11.320, 10.583] -> 10.047+11.922=21.969; 21.969+11.320=33.289; 33.289+10.583=43.872 -> 43.872/4=10.968\n\n 15.

Actually, hour2 and hour3 are different? \n        But we computed hour2: [6.966, 10.449, 10.516, 9.243] -> 9.2935\n        hour3: [6.095, 9.243, 11.387, 10.449] -> 9.2935? Actually, the sum for hour3 was 37.174? \n        Let me check: 6.095+9.243=15.338; 15.338+11.387=26.725; 26.725+10.449=37.174 -> 37.174/4=9.2935.\n\n        So both hour2 and hour3 are 9.2935? That's a coincidence.\n\n 16. Now, we create the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2017-10-16 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.71225\n               2017-10-16 01:00:00 -> hour1: 9.77925\n               2017-10-16 02:00:00 -> hour2: 9.2935\n               2017-10-16 03:00:00 -> hour3: 9.2935\n               ... until 2017-10-16 23:00:00 -> hour23: 10.968\n\n        Day2: 2017-10-17 00:00:00 -> hour0: 9.71225\n               2017-10-17 01:00:00 -> hour1: 9.77925\n               ... same 24 values.\n\n        Day3: 2017-10-18: same 24 values.\n        Day4: 2017-10-19: same 24 values.\n\n 17. Format the output:\n\n        We must output the date and the HUFL value, but the value should be rounded? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Example: 9.71225 -> 9.712\n\n        But note: 9.71225 rounded to 3 decimals is 9.712? \n        Actually, 9.71225 * 1000 = 9712.25 -> rounded to integer 9712 -> then 9.712.\n\n        However, we have 9.77925 -> 9.779\n\n        But let me check: 9.77925 * 1000 = 9779.25 -> rounded to 9779 -> then 9.779.\n\n        But note: the rounding rule: if the next digit is 5, we round to the nearest even? \n        However, for simplicity, we can use rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places by truncating? But the problem does not specify.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 18. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00  9.712\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00  9.779\n        2017-10-16 02:00:00  9.294   # because 9.2935 rounded: 9.294 (since the 4th decimal is 5, we round up the 3rd from 3 to 4)\n        2017-10-16 03:00:00  9.294   # same\n\n        How to round 9.2935? \n            The rule: round half to even? \n            9.2935: \n                The digit in the 3rd decimal is 3, the next is 5 -> we look at the next digits (none) and then we round to the nearest even? \n                Actually, 9.2935 is exactly halfway between 9.293 and 9.294. The rule is to round to the nearest even digit in the 3rd decimal? \n                The digit 3 is odd, so we round up? -> 9.294.\n\n        But note: the common practice is to round half up. So 9.2935 -> 9.294.\n\n        Similarly, 9.71225: the 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5, so we leave as 9.712.\n\n        So we'll round each mean to 3 decimal places.\n\n 19. Rounding:\n\n        hour0: 9.71225 -> 9.712\n        hour1: 9.77925 -> 9.779\n        hour2: 9.2935 -> 9.294\n        hour3: 9.2935 -> 9.294\n        hour4: 9.595 -> 9.595\n        hour5: 10.49925 -> 10.499\n        hour6: 11.31925 -> 11.319\n        hour7: 12.341 -> 12.341\n        hour8: 8.65725 -> 8.657\n        hour9: 6.01175 -> 6.012\n        hour10: 4.75575 -> 4.756\n        hour11: 1.256 -> 1.256\n        hour12: 1.892 -> 1.892\n        hour13: 1.524 -> 1.524\n        hour14: 2.04275 -> 2.043\n        hour15: 3.23175 -> 3.232\n        hour16: 5.02325 -> 5.023\n        hour17: 7.73625 -> 7.736\n        hour18: 7.28425 -> 7.284\n        hour19: 6.98275 -> 6.983\n        hour20: 6.34625 -> 6.346\n        hour21: 5.87725 -> 5.877\n        hour22: 9.6785 -> 9.679\n        hour23: 10.968 -> 10.968   (since 10.968 is already 3 decimals? Actually, we computed 10.968 exactly? \n                but 43.872/4=10.968 exactly? yes, because 43.872 is divisible by 4: 43.872/4=10.968)\n\n 20. Now, we have the 24 rounded values:\n\n        [9.712, 9.779, 9.294, 9.294, 9.595, 10.499, 11.319, 12.341, 8.657, 6.012, 4.756, 1.256, 1.892, 1.524, 2.043, 3.232, 5.023, 7.736, 7.284, 6.983, 6.346, 5.877, 9.679, 10.968]\n\n 21. Then we repeat this list 4 times for the 4 days.\n\n 22. Generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-10-16 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-10-16 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-19 23:00:00.\n\n 23. Write the output in the required format.\n\n 24. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 25. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 26. Let's do it.\n\n 27. But note: the input had the date as string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 28. We'll generate:\n\n        \"2017-10-16 00:00:00\"  [first value: 9.712]\n        \"2017-10-16 01:00:00\"  9.779]\n        ... \n\n 29. We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-16 00:00:00  9.712\n2017-10-16 01:00:00  9.779\n2017-10-16 02:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-16 03:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-16 04:00:00  9.595\n2017-10-16 05:00:00  10.499\n2017-10-16 06:00:00  11.319\n2017-10-16 07:00:00  12.341\n2017-10-16 08:00:00  8.657\n2017-10-16 09:00:00  6.012\n2017-10-16 10:00:00  4.756\n2017-10-16 11:00:00  1.256\n2017-10-16 12:00:00  1.892\n2017-10-16 13:00:00  1.524\n2017-10-16 14:00:00  2.043\n2017-10-16 15:00:00  3.232\n2017-10-16 16:00:00  5.023\n2017-10-16 17:00:00  7.736\n2017-10-16 18:00:00  7.284\n2017-10-16 19:00:00  6.983\n2017-10-16 20:00:00  6.346\n2017-10-16 21:00:00  5.877\n2017-10-16 22:00:00  9.679\n2017-10-16 23:00:00  10.968\n2017-10-17 00:00:00  9.712\n2017-10-17 01:00:00  9.779\n2017-10-17 02:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-17 03:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-17 04:00:00  9.595\n2017-10-17 05:00:00  10.499\n2017-10-17 06:00:00  11.319\n2017-10-17 07:00:00  12.341\n2017-10-17 08:00:00  8.657\n2017-10-17 09:00:00  6.012\n2017-10-17 10:00:00  4.756\n2017-10-17 11:00:00  1.256\n2017-10-17 12:00:00  1.892\n2017-10-17 13:00:00  1.524\n2017-10-17 14:00:00  2.043\n2017-10-17 15:00:00  3.232\n2017-10-17 16:00:00  5.023\n2017-10-17 17:00:00  7.736\n2017-10-17 18:00:00  7.284\n2017-10-17 19:00:00  6.983\n2017-10-17 20:00:00  6.346\n2017-10-17 21:00:00  5.877\n2017-10-17 22:00:00  9.679\n2017-10-17 23:00:00  10.968\n2017-10-18 00:00:00  9.712\n2017-10-18 01:00:00  9.779\n2017-10-18 02:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-18 03:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-18 04:00:00  9.595\n2017-10-18 05:00:00  10.499\n2017-10-18 06:00:00  11.319\n2017-10-18 07:00:00  12.341\n2017-10-18 08:00:00  8.657\n2017-10-18 09:00:00  6.012\n2017-10-18 10:00:00  4.756\n2017-10-18 11:00:00  1.256\n2017-10-18 12:00:00  1.892\n2017-10-18 13:00:00  1.524\n2017-10-18 14:00:00  2.043\n2017-10-18 15:00:00  3.232\n2017-10-18 16:00:00  5.023\n2017-10-18 17:00:00  7.736\n2017-10-18 18:00:00  7.284\n2017-10-18 19:00:00  6.983\n2017-10-18 20:00:00  6.346\n2017-10-18 21:00:00  5.877\n2017-10-18 22:00:00  9.679\n2017-10-18 23:00:00  10.968\n2017-10-19 00:00:00  9.712\n2017-10-19 01:00:00  9.779\n2017-10-19 02:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-19 03:00:00  9.294\n2017-10-19 04:00:00  9.595\n2017-10-19 05:00:00  10.499\n2017-10-19 06:00:00  11.319\n2017-10-19 07:00:00  12.341\n2017-10-19 08:00:00  8.657\n2017-10-19 09:00:00  6.012\n2017-10-19 10:00:00  4.756\n2017-10-19 11:00:00  1.256\n2017-10-19 12:00:00  1.892\n2017-10-19 13:00:00  1.524\n2017-10-19 14:00:00  2.043\n2017-10-19 15:00:00  3.232\n2017-10-19 16:00:00  5.023\n2017-10-19 17:00:00  7.736\n2017-10-19 18:00:00  7.284\n2017-10-19 19:00:00  6.983\n2017-10-19 20:00:00  6.346\n2017-10-19 21:00:00  5.877\n2017-10-19 22:00:00  9.679\n2017-10-19 23:00:00  10.968\n```\n\n 30.
