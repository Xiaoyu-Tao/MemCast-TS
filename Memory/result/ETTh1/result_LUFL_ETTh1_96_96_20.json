        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2016-09-19 00:00:00 to 2016-09-22 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. \n    However, we must be cautious for the forecast period. But note: the user says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the provided data for the past 96 is complete? \n    The user says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then provides 96 points without any missing. So we assume the provided history is complete.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. The last timestamp in the given data is 2016-09-22 23:00:00. \n    The next 96 hours would be from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00.\n\n 4. Since the data shows a daily pattern (with two days having a similar pattern and two days having a spike at midnight), we can consider a time series model that captures:\n    - Seasonality: likely daily (24 hours) and possibly weekly? But we only have 4 days, so weekly is not visible. We'll stick to daily.\n    - Trend: not clear from 4 days, but we can use a model that can adapt.\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that can handle multiple seasonality. However, the data has:\n    - On 2016-09-19 and 2016-09-21, the midnight values are around 1.6-1.8, but on 2016-09-20 and 2016-09-22, the midnight values are around 4.0.\n    This suggests that there might be a pattern every two days? Or it could be an anomaly? But we have only two cycles of two days? \n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple model like a seasonal naive method, but the two-day pattern is not consistent. \n\n 7. Considering the complexity and the small data, we can use an Exponential Smoothing model with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components.\n\n 8. However, note that the data has a spike at the beginning of the day on 2016-09-20 and 2016-09-22 (at 00:00:00) which is much higher than the same time on 2016-09-19 and 2016-09-21.\n\n 9. We can try to decompose the series and then forecast. But with only 4 days, decomposition might be challenging.\n\n10. Another idea: use the average of the two patterns? But we have two types of days: \n    - Day 1 (2016-09-19 and 2016-09-21): lower midnight value (around 1.6) and then a peak at 6:00 (around 2.4) and then fluctuations during the day.\n    - Day 2 (2016-09-20 and 2016-09-22): very high midnight value (around 4.0) and then a peak at 6:00 (around 5.0) and then a drop at 8:00 to around 2.0 and then similar pattern to Day 1.\n\n    The pattern after 8:00 seems similar across days? Let's compare:\n\n    For example, 2016-09-19 08:00: 2.315, 09:00: 2.284, ... until 23:00: 1.797.\n    2016-09-20 08:00: 2.163, 09:00: 2.467, ... ... 23:00: 1.675.\n    2016-09-21 08:00: 2.284, 09:00: 2.102, ... ... 23:00: 1.675.\n    2016-09-22 08:00: 2.041, 09:00: 2.132, ... ... 23:00: 1.401.\n\n    The pattern from 8:00 to 23:00 is somewhat similar but not exactly. \n\n11. Given the ambiguity, we must produce a forecast. We can use a model that automatically captures seasonality and trend.\n\n12. We'll use the `statsmodels` library for a seasonal decomposition and then forecasting with an appropriate model. However, we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code? \n\n    But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the forecast. We are expected to generate the next 96 points.\n\n13. Since we cannot run code here, we must rely on a logical approach.\n\n    Option: \n      - We observe that the two days with high midnight (2016-09-20 and 2016-09-22) are even days?\n      - 19th (odd), 20th (even), 21st (odd), 22nd (even) -> then the next day (23rd) is odd, then 24th even, 25th odd, 26th even.\n\n    So we might expect:\n      - 2016-09-23 (odd): similar to 2016-09-19 and 2016-09-21 -> midnight around 1.6\n      - 2016-09-24 (even): similar to 2016-09-20 and 2016-09-22 -> midnight around 4.0\n      - and so on.\n\n    Then we can take the average of the two odd days (19th and 21st) for the odd day pattern, and the average of the two even days (20th and 22nd) for the even day pattern.\n\n    However, note that the two odd days are not exactly the same, and the two even days are not exactly the same.\n\n    We can do:\n\n      For the next 4 days (23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th) which are odd, even, odd, even:\n\n        Day 1 (23rd, odd): use the average of 19th and 21st for each hour.\n        Day 2 (24th, even): use the average of 20th and 22nd for each hour.\n        Day 3 (25th, odd): use the average of 19th and 21st for each hour.\n        Day 4 (26th, even): use the average of 20th and 22nd for each hour.\n\n    But note: the data for 19th and 21st:\n\n        19th: [1.645, 1.462, 1.432, 1.462, 1.310, 1.858, 2.467, 2.406, 2.315, 2.284, 2.224, 2.498, 1.858, 2.041, 1.919, 1.767, 1.919, 2.163, 2.163, 2.376, 2.224, 1.828, 1.492, 1.797]\n        21st: [1.401, 1.310, 1.127, 1.127, 1.340, 1.614, 2.376, 2.315, 2.284, 2.102, 2.559, 2.863, 1.858, 2.163, 1.980, 2.010, 1.949, 2.315, 2.376, 2.559, 2.254, 1.919, 1.553, 1.675]\n\n    Average for odd day:\n\n        hour0: (1.645 + 1.401)/2 = 1.523\n        hour1: (1.462 + 1.310)/2 = 1.386\n        ... and so on.\n\n    Similarly for even days (20th and 22nd):\n\n        20th: [4.142, 4.082, 3.899, 3.807, 4.051, 4.264, 4.995, 4.752, 2.163, 2.467, 2.741, 2.741, 2.010, 1.828, 1.767, 1.919, 2.163, 2.345, 2.284, 2.559, 2.224, 1.888, 1.736, 1.675]\n        22nd: [4.203, 4.234, 4.142, 4.142, 3.960, 4.142, 4.752, 4.630, 2.041, 2.132, 2.437, 2.772, 1.919, 1.797, 1.949, 2.071, 1.858, 2.528, 2.406, 2.284, 2.102, 1.736, 1.553, 1.401]\n\n    Average for even day:\n\n        hour0: (4.142+4.203)/2 = 4.1725\n        hour1: (4.082+4.234)/2 = 4.158\n        ... \n\n    However, note that the even days have a drop at 8:00 (from around 4.6 to 2.0). The odd days do not have that drop at 8:00? Actually, the odd days have a drop at 8:00? \n\n    Looking at 19th: \n        7:00: 2.406 -> 8:00: 2.315 -> not a big drop? \n        21st: 7:00: 2.315 -> 8:00: 2.284 -> not a big drop.\n\n    But the even days:\n        20th: 7:00: 4.752 -> 8:00: 2.163 -> big drop.\n        22nd: 7:00: 4.630 -> 8:00: 2.041 -> big drop.\n\n    So the pattern for the first 8 hours is different.\n\n14. Therefore, we will generate the next 96 hours by:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-09-23, odd): use the average of 19th and 21st for each hour (0 to 23)\n    Day 2 (2016-09-24, even): use the average of 20th and 22nd for each hour (0 to 23)\n    Day 3 (2016-09-25, odd): use the average of 19th and 21st for each hour (0 to 23)\n    Day 4 (2016-09-26, even): use the average of 20th and 22nd for each hour (0 to 23)\n\n15. We must generate the timestamps and the LUFL values.\n\n    The last given timestamp is 2016-09-22 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2016-09-23 00:00:00.\n\n    We'll generate:\n\n        2016-09-23 00:00:00 -> average of 2016-09-19 00:00:00 and 2016-09-21 00:00:00: (1.645+1.401)/2 = 1.523\n        2016-09-23 01:00:00 -> (1.462+1.310)/2 = 1.386\n        ... until 2016-09-23 23:00:00 -> (1.797+1.675)/2 = 1.736\n\n    Then for 2016-09-24 00:00:00: (4.142+4.203)/2 = 4.1725 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 4.173\n        2016-09-24 01:00:00: (4.082+4.234)/2 = 4.158\n        ... and so on.\n\n16. We'll compute the averages and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n17. Let's do the calculations:\n\n    For odd day (23rd and 25th) pattern:\n\n        hour0: (1.645 + 1.401) / 2 = 1.523\n        hour1: (1.462 + 1.310) / 2 = 1.386\n        hour2: (1.432 + 1.127) / 2 = 1.2795 -> 1.280\n        hour3: (1.462 + 1.127) / 2 = 1.2945 -> 1.295\n        hour4: (1.310 + 1.340) / 2 = 1.325\n        hour5: (1.858 + 1.614) / 2 = 1.736\n        hour6: (2.467 + 2.376) / 2 = 2.4215 -> 2.422\n        hour7: (2.406 + 2.315) / 2 = 2.3605 -> 2.361\n        hour8: (2.315 + 2.284) / 2 = 2.2995 -> 2.300\n        hour9: (2.284 + 2.102) / 2 = 2.193\n        hour10: (2.224 + 2.559) / 2 = 2.3915 -> 2.392\n        hour11: (2.498 + 2.863) / 2 = 2.6805 -> 2.681\n        hour12: (1.858 + 1.858) / 2 = 1.858\n        hour13: (2.041 + 2.163) / 2 = 2.102\n        hour14: (1.919 + 1.980) / 2 = 1.9495 -> 1.950\n        hour15: (1.767 + 2.010) / 2 = 1.8885 -> 1.889\n        hour16: (1.919 + 1.949) / 2 = 1.934\n        hour17: (2.163 + 2.315) / 2 = 2.239\n        hour18: (2.163 + 2.376) / 2 = 2.2695 -> 2.270\n        hour19: (2.376 + 2.559) / 2 = 2.4675 -> 2.468\n        hour20: (2.224 + 2.254) / 2 = 2.239\n        hour21: (1.828 + 1.919) / 2 = 1.8735 -> 1.874\n        hour22: (1.492 + 1.553) / 2 = 1.5225 -> 1.523\n        hour23: (1.797 + 1.675) / 2 = 1.736\n\n    For even day (24th and 26th) pattern:\n\n        hour0: (4.142 + 4.203) / 2 = 4.1725 -> 4.173\n        hour1: (4.082 + 4.234) / 2 = 4.158\n        hour2: (3.899 + 4.142) / 2 = 4.0205 -> 4.021\n        hour3: (3.807 + 4.142) / 2 = 3.9745 -> 3.975\n        hour4: (4.051 + 3.960) / 2 = 4.0055 -> 4.006\n        hour5: (4.264 + 4.142) / 2 = 4.203\n        hour6: (4.995 + 4.752) / 2 = 4.8735 -> 4.874\n        hour7: (4.752 + 4.630) / 2 = 4.691\n        hour8: (2.163 + 2.041) / 2 = 2.102\n        hour9: (2.467 + 2.132) / 2 = 2.2995 -> 2.300\n        hour10: (2.741 + 2.437) / 2 = 2.589\n        hour11: (2.741 + 2.772) / 2 = 2.7565 -> 2.757\n        hour12: (2.010 + 1.919) / 2 = 1.9645 -> 1.965\n        hour13: (1.828 + 1.797) / 2 = 1.8125 -> 1.813\n        hour14: (1.767 + 1.949) / 2 = 1.858\n        hour15: (1.919 + 2.071) / 2 = 1.995\n        hour16: (2.163 + 1.858) / 2 = 2.0105 -> 2.011\n        hour17: (2.345 + 2.528) / 2 = 2.4365 -> 2.437\n        hour18: (2.284 + 2.406) / 2 = 2.345\n        hour19: (2.559 + 2.284) / 2 = 2.4215 -> 2.422\n        hour20: (2.224 + 2.102) / 2 = 2.163\n        hour21: (1.888 + 1.736) / 2 = 1.812\n        hour22: (1.736 + 1.553) / 2 = 1.6445 -> 1.645\n        hour23: (1.675 + 1.401) / 2 = 1.538\n\n18. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n    Day1: 2016-09-23 (odd) -> 24 hours: from 00:00 to 23:00 with the odd day pattern above.\n    Day2: 2016-09-24 (even) -> 24 hours: from 00:00 to 23:00 with the even day pattern above.\n    Day3: 2016-09-25 (odd) -> same as Day1\n    Day4: 2016-09-26 (even) -> same as Day2\n\n19.

We write the data in the same format: \n        date (as string) and LUFL (as float rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n21.
