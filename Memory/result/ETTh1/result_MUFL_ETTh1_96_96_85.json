        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values (like NaN) in the given sample, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n However, in the provided 96 points, we have consecutive timestamps without gaps. So we assume that for the given 96 points, there are no missing values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is at hourly frequency.\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data is time series with potential seasonality (daily patterns) and we have only 96 points (4 days) for training, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n Given the small data size and the requirement to handle potential missing values (though not present in the given training data), we can use:\n   - Linear interpolation for any missing values in the training data? But the given data has no missing values in the provided 96 points.\n   - For forecasting, we can use a model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: for example, on each day we see a drop during the day (especially around 9:00 to 15:00) and then a rise in the evening and night.\n   We have 4 days of data: from 2017-06-06 to 2017-06-09.\n\n But note: the data on 2017-06-07 and 2017-06-08 show very negative values during the day (down to -15), while 2017-06-06 and 2017-06-09 are less extreme.\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, it is challenging to capture weekly patterns. We will assume daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n We can use the following:\n   - SARIMA: We'll try to fit a model with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24). But with only 4 days, we have limited data for seasonal estimation.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: \n   - Calculate the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the overall trend? But we have only 4 days.\n\n However, note the data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days. We can check:\n\n   The first day (2017-06-06) starts at 7.427 and the last day (2017-06-09) ends at 4.015, but the values in between vary.\n\n Given the complexity and the small data, we might use a naive seasonal method: \n   - Forecast each hour of the average of that hour over the past 4 days? But that would be too simplistic and ignore any trend.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (2017-06-09) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous day? \n\n However, the problem requires 96 points (4 days) and we must account for potential non-stationarity.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use a seasonal naive model with a drift. But note: the data has negative values and fluctuations.\n\n Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing with daily seasonality (Holt-Winters). We have to set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n Steps for Holt-Winters:\n   - We'll use the additive seasonality because the variation in seasonality seems roughly constant over time? \n     But looking at the data: the magnitude of the negative values on 2017-06-07 and 2017-06-08 is larger than on 2017-06-06 and 2017-06-09. \n     So multiplicative seasonality might be more appropriate? However, with only 4 days, it's hard to tell.\n\n   - We'll try additive first and then if we see the variance increasing, we might switch. But we have to choose one.\n\n   - We can use the `statsmodels` library to fit an ExponentialSmoothing model. However, since we are generating the forecast without running code, we have to simulate the process.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the next 96 points.\n\n Since we cannot run code, we have to rely on a simple method that we can compute manually.\n\n Proposed method:\n\n   Step 1: Check for missing values in the provided data? The given data has 96 points without gaps.\n\n   Step 2: We will use the average of the last two days (or the last three days) to form the daily pattern? \n            But the pattern varies. Alternatively, we can use the entire 4 days to compute the daily pattern.\n\n   Step 3: We note that the data might have a trend? Let's compute the average of each day:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-06-06): average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        Day 2: average\n        Day 3: average\n        Day 4: average\n\n   Then we can compute the overall trend per day? \n\n   However, we are limited to 4 days. We can compute the linear trend over the 4 days and then project the next 4 days.\n\n   Step 4: We can decompose the series into:\n        Y(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonal(t) + Residual(t)\n\n   We can estimate the trend by a moving average? But with 4 days, we can do:\n\n        Trend(t) = linear regression over the entire 96 points? \n\n   Then subtract the trend to get the seasonal component? \n\n   Then average the seasonal component for each hour of the day.\n\n   Then forecast: \n        Y_hat(t) = Trend_hat(t) + Seasonal(t mod 24)\n\n   How to project the trend? We can fit a linear regression on the entire 96 points and then extend the line for the next 96 points.\n\n   But note: the data might not be linear? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last day as the base and then use the seasonal component? \n\n   Given the time, we choose:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the daily averages:\n\n            Day1: 2017-06-06: \n                values: [7.427, 7.0, 6.823, 5.899, 6.716, 7.178, 4.797, 4.442, 1.777, 1.599, 4.158, 1.173, -1.599, -3.056, -1.99, -3.163, 0.569, -1.67, 2.63, 3.553, 4.087, 4.548, 3.589, 5.046]\n                average = (sum) / 24 = ?\n\n            Let me compute:\n\n                Day1: \n                  7.427+7.0+6.823+5.899+6.716+7.178+4.797+4.442+1.777+1.599+4.158+1.173-1.599-3.056-1.99-3.163+0.569-1.67+2.63+3.553+4.087+4.548+3.589+5.046\n                = 7.427+7.0=14.427; +6.823=21.25; +5.899=27.149; +6.716=33.865; +7.178=41.043; +4.797=45.84; +4.442=50.282; \n                +1.777=52.059; +1.599=53.658; +4.158=57.816; +1.173=58.989; \n                -1.599=57.39; -3.056=54.334; -1.99=52.344; -3.163=49.181; \n                +0.569=49.75; -1.67=48.08; \n                +2.63=50.71; +3.553=54.263; +4.087=58.35; +4.548=62.898; +3.589=66.487; +5.046=71.533.\n\n                average = 71.533 / 24 = 2.98054\n\n            Day2: 2017-06-07: \n                [7.995,7.569,8.102,7.498,6.823,7.853,7.676,6.752,2.843,-3.802,-12.366,-10.518,-15.387,-16.879,-12.793,-6.005,-5.899,0.640,0.640,3.553,4.335,3.909,4.371,6.005]\n                Let's compute:\n                  7.995+7.569=15.564; +8.102=23.666; +7.498=31.164; +6.823=37.987; +7.853=45.84; +7.676=53.516; +6.752=60.268; \n                  +2.843=63.111; -3.802=59.309; -12.366=46.943; -10.518=36.425; -15.387=21.038; -16.879=4.159; -12.793=-8.634; -6.005=-14.639; \n                  -5.899=-20.538; 0.640=-19.898; 0.640=-19.258; 3.553=-15.705; 4.335=-11.37; 3.909=-7.461; 4.371=-3.09; 6.005=2.915.\n                average = 2.915 / 24 = 0.12146\n\n            Day3: 2017-06-08:\n                [7.711,7.604,8.280,8.102,6.432,7.676,7.604,3.980,-3.376,-7.747,-11.762,-12.899,-15.138,-4.833,-9.559,-6.823,-5.153,3.234,3.127,4.193,4.548,4.264,3.838,4.904]\n                Compute:\n                  7.711+7.604=15.315; +8.280=23.595; +8.102=31.697; +6.432=38.129; +7.676=45.805; +7.604=53.409; +3.980=57.389;\n                  -3.376=54.013; -7.747=46.266; -11.762=34.504; -12.899=21.605; -15.138=6.467; -4.833=1.634; -9.559=-7.925; -6.823=-14.748; -5.153=-19.901;\n                  3.234=-16.667; 3.127=-13.54; 4.193=-9.347; 4.548=-4.799; 4.264=-0.535; 3.838=3.303; 4.904=8.207.\n                average = 8.207 / 24 = 0.34196\n\n            Day4: 2017-06-09:\n                [7.000,6.041,7.853,6.076,7.533,6.965,8.493,5.330,-0.533,-2.168,-1.528,-1.279,-1.031,2.559,1.279,3.269,4.051,4.477,2.132,3.767,4.477,4.122,3.767,4.015]\n                Compute:\n                  7.000+6.041=13.041; +7.853=20.894; +6.076=26.97; +7.533=34.503; +6.965=41.468; +8.493=49.961; +5.330=55.291;\n                  -0.533=54.758; -2.168=52.59; -1.528=51.062; -1.279=49.783; -1.031=48.752; \n                  2.559=51.311; 1.279=52.59; 3.269=55.859; 4.051=59.91; 4.477=64.387; 2.132=66.519; 3.767=70.286; 4.477=74.763; 4.122=78.885; 3.767=82.652; 4.015=86.667.\n                average = 86.667 / 24 = 3.611125\n\n        The daily averages: [2.98054, 0.12146, 0.34196, 3.611125]\n\n        We can see a trend? It goes down then up. But we have only 4 points. We can fit a linear regression to these 4 daily averages to get a trend per day.\n\n        Let x = [0,1,2,3] for the four days, and y = [2.98054, 0.12146, 0.34196, 3.611125]\n\n        We can compute the slope and intercept:\n\n            n = 4\n            sum_x = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n            sum_y = 2.98054+0.12146+0.34196+3.611125 = 7.055085\n            sum_xy = 0*2.98054 + 1*0.12146 + 2*0.34196 + 3*3.611125 = 0 + 0.12146 + 0.68392 + 10.833375 = 11.638755\n            sum_x2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n            slope (b) = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n                      = (4*11.638755 - 6*7.055085) / (4*14 - 36)\n                      = (46.55502 - 42.33051) / (56 - 36)\n                      = 4.22451 / 20 = 0.2112255\n\n            intercept (a) = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (7.055085 - 0.2112255*6) / 4 = (7.055085 - 1.267353) / 4 = 5.787732 / 4 = 1.446933\n\n        So the daily average trend: \n            Day0 (2017-06-06): 1.446933 + 0.2112255*0 = 1.446933\n            Day1: 1.446933 + 0.2112255*1 = 1.6581585\n            Day2: 1.446933 + 0.2112255*2 = 1.869384\n            Day3: 1.446933 + 0.2112255*3 = 2.0806095\n\n        But our actual daily averages were [2.98054, 0.12146, 0.34196, 3.611125]. The linear trend does not fit well because the data is not linear.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days to project? \n\n        We see that the daily average on day4 (3.611125) is higher than day3 (0.34196). We can assume the next four days will have an average of around 3.6? \n\n        But the data has a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to see weekly.\n\n        Given the complexity, we are going to use the average of the entire 4 days as the base level and then use the daily seasonality.\n\n        Step 5: Compute the seasonal indices for each hour.\n\n            We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 observations.\n\n            We can compute the average for each hour across the 4 days.\n\n            Then, we can adjust by the overall mean? \n\n            Overall mean of the entire 96 points: (sum of all 96 points) / 96\n\n            The overall mean = (sum of daily totals) / 96 = (71.533 + 2.915 + 8.207 + 86.667) / 96 = (169.322) / 96 = 1.7641875\n\n            Then, for each hour i (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour and then the seasonal index = average_i - overall_mean.\n\n            But note: we are using additive model.\n\n        However, we can also compute the seasonal component by:\n\n            For each day, we subtract the daily average to get the seasonal deviation for that hour.\n\n            Then average the deviations for each hour across the 4 days.\n\n        This is better because it removes the daily level.\n\n        So:\n\n            For hour0: \n                Day1: 7.427 - 2.98054 = 4.44646\n                Day2: 7.995 - 0.12146 = 7.87354\n                Day3: 7.711 - 0.34196 = 7.36904\n                Day4: 7.000 - 3.611125 = 3.388875\n                Average = (4.44646+7.87354+7.36904+3.388875)/4 = 22.077915/4 = 5.51947875\n\n            Similarly for hour1, ... until hour23.\n\n        Then, for forecasting, we need to set the level for the next 4 days. \n\n        How to set the level for the next day? \n\n            We can use the last day's average? Or the average of the last two days? \n\n            We see the last day (day4) average was 3.611125, and the day before was 0.34196. \n\n            We can use a moving average? \n\n            We'll use the average of the last two days: (0.34196 + 3.611125)/2 = 1.9765425\n\n            Then for the next four days, we assume the daily average will be around 1.9765425? \n\n            But we see an upward trend from day3 to day4. We can project the daily average for the next four days as:\n\n                Day5: 3.611125 + (3.611125 - 0.34196)/4   [using a naive trend]? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use the linear trend we computed earlier? \n\n            According to the linear trend, the next four days (days 4,5,6,7) would be:\n\n                Day4: x=3 -> 2.0806095 (but we have 3.611125, so the trend is not capturing)\n                We can adjust: the linear trend was not fitting well.\n\n        Given the time, we decide to use the average of the entire 4 days as the base level for the forecast? \n\n        But note: the overall mean is 1.7641875. \n\n        Then the forecast for hour i in the future would be: overall_mean + seasonal_index_i.\n\n        However, that would be a constant daily pattern. \n\n        We can also use the last day's average (3.611125) as the base and then add the seasonal index? \n\n        But the seasonal index we computed by subtracting the daily average. So if we use the last day's average as the base, then:\n\n            forecast for hour i = base (for that day) + seasonal_index_i\n\n        How to set the base for each of the next 4 days? \n\n            We can use the average of the last two days: 1.9765425 for each day? \n\n            Or we can use the last day's average (3.611125) for the first forecast day, then for the next day we use 3.611125 + (3.611125 - 0.34196)/3? \n\n            But that might be too aggressive.\n\n        We decide to use the average of the last two days (1.9765425) as the base for each of the next 4 days? \n\n        Then the forecast for a particular hour i in any of the next 4 days would be:\n\n            base + seasonal_index_i\n\n        But note: the seasonal index we computed is the deviation from the daily average. So if we use a base for the day, then we add the seasonal index.\n\n        However, we computed the seasonal index as the average( observation_i - daily_average for that day )\n\n        So for a future day, we set the daily average to 1.9765425, then the hour i would be 1.9765425 + seasonal_index_i.\n\n        But we have 4 days of forecast, and we use the same base for each day? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day's average for the first forecast day, and then the next day we use the last day's average plus the average daily change? \n\n        The average daily change: (daily_avg_day4 - daily_avg_day1) / 3 = (3.611125 - 2.98054)/3 = 0.210195\n\n        So:\n\n            Day5 (2017-06-10): base = 3.611125 + 0.210195 = 3.82132\n            Day6: 3.82132 + 0.210195 = 4.031515\n            Day7: 4.031515 + 0.210195 = 4.24171\n            Day8: 4.24171 + 0.210195 = 4.451905\n\n        Then for each hour i in day5: forecast = base_day5 + seasonal_index_i\n        for day6: base_day6 + seasonal_index_i, etc.\n\n        This method assumes a linear trend in the daily average.\n\n        We'll go with this.\n\n        Step 6: Compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the deviations from the daily mean.\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour:\n\n        Let S = [0]*24   # to store the sum of deviations for each hour\n        count = 4 for each hour.\n\n        We have:\n\n          Day1: daily_avg1 = 2.98054\n          Day2: daily_avg2 = 0.12146\n          Day3: daily_avg3 = 0.34196\n          Day4: daily_avg4 = 3.611125\n\n        For hour0 (00:00):\n            dev1 = 7.427 - 2.98054 = 4.44646\n            dev2 = 7.995 - 0.12146 = 7.87354\n            dev3 = 7.711 - 0.34196 = 7.36904\n            dev4 = 7.000 - 3.611125 = 3.388875\n            S[0] = (4.44646+7.87354+7.36904+3.388875) = 23.077915\n            seasonal_index[0] = 23.077915 / 4 = 5.76947875\n\n        For hour1 (01:00):\n            dev1 = 7.0 - 2.98054 = 4.01946\n            dev2 = 7.569 - 0.12146 = 7.44754\n            dev3 = 7.604 - 0.34196 = 7.26204\n            dev4 = 6.041 - 3.611125 = 2.429875\n            S[1] = 4.01946+7.44754+7.26204+2.429875 = 21.158915\n            seasonal_index[1] = 21.158915/4 = 5.28972875\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n        Then, for forecasting:\n\n            Day5: 2017-06-10: base = 3.82132\n            Then for hour0: 3.82132 + 5.76947875 = 9.59079875\n            hour1: 3.82132 + 5.28972875 = 9.11104875\n            ... until hour23.\n\n            Day6: base = 4.031515\n            hour0: 4.031515 + 5.76947875 = 9.80099375\n            hour1: 4.031515 + 5.28972875 = 9.32124375\n            ...\n\n        We do this for 4 days.\n\n        Step 7: We must generate 96 points.\n\n        However, note: the data has negative values and our method might produce negative values?
