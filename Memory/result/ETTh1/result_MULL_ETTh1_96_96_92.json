        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. \n    However, the provided sample for the past 96 points is complete. We must be prepared to handle missing values in the forecasting process.\n\n 2. Since we are to provide the next 96 points, we are forecasting from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the pattern (which seems to have daily seasonality of 24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 4. We observe that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern: higher values during the day (e.g., 9:00 to 16:00) and lower (even negative) at night.\n    - Some volatility and possible outliers (like negative values on 2017-07-05 and 2017-07-06).\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a simple seasonal model.\n\n 6. However, note that the data does not perfectly repeat. We might consider:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day (or the last available same hour). But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the last 4 days? \n    - Or use a moving average method.\n\n 7. But the problem says there might be missing values. We are not told about missing values in the provided 96 points, but we can assume that if there are, we have to impute them. \n    However, the provided data is complete.\n\n 8. We are going to use a simple method: \n    - We will take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days (if available) for each hour in the day.\n\n 9. Steps for forecasting:\n    For each hour in the day (0 to 23):\n        Let h be the hour (0 for 00:00, 1 for 01:00, ... 23 for 23:00).\n        We have 4 days of data: day1 (2017-07-04), day2 (2017-07-05), day3 (2017-07-06), day4 (2017-07-07).\n        We compute the average of the h-th hour of these 4 days.\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (2017-07-08 to 2017-07-11), we assign the average for each hour.\n\n 10. Why this method?\n     - It's simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n     - It uses the entire available 4 days to smooth out any one-day anomalies.\n\n 11. However, note that the data we have is only 4 days. We are going to use the average for each hour over these 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 12. But what if there was a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a long-term trend. Also, the data is only 4 days, so we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n 13. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll group the data by the hour of the day and take the mean.\n\n 14. Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.954\n        Day2: 2.452\n        Day3: -0.142\n        Day4: 0.391\n        Average = (1.954 + 2.452 - 0.142 + 0.391) / 4 = (4.655) / 4 = 1.16375\n\n     Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 15. Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern.\n\n 16. The forecast for:\n        Day5 (2017-07-08): [avg_h0, avg_h1, ..., avg_h23]\n        Day6 (2017-07-09): same pattern\n        Day7 (2017-07-10): same pattern\n        Day8 (2017-07-11): same pattern\n\n 17. We must generate 96 data points (24 hours * 4 days).\n\n 18. Format the output: We must output the date and time from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00 with the forecasted MULL.\n\n 19. We note that the data has negative values, so our forecast might be negative as well.\n\n 20. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and compute the average of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n 21. The data provided:\n\n        Hour 0: [1.954, 2.452, -0.142, 0.391] -> avg = (1.954+2.452-0.142+0.391)/4 = 4.655/4 = 1.16375\n        Hour 1: [2.985, 3.056, 0.142, -0.142] -> (2.985+3.056+0.142-0.142)/4 = 6.041/4 = 1.51025\n        Hour 2: [2.416, 2.168, -0.533, 0.142] -> (2.416+2.168-0.533+0.142)/4 = 4.193/4 = 1.04825\n        Hour 3: [3.127, 2.594, 0.142, -0.711] -> (3.127+2.594+0.142-0.711)/4 = 5.152/4 = 1.288\n        Hour 4: [2.381, 2.381, 0.000, -0.604] -> (2.381+2.381+0.000-0.604)/4 = 4.158/4 = 1.0395\n        Hour 5: [2.985, 1.954, -0.675, -0.924] -> (2.985+1.954-0.675-0.924)/4 = 3.34/4 = 0.835\n        Hour 6: [1.954, 2.772, -1.173, -1.279] -> (1.954+2.772-1.173-1.279)/4 = 2.274/4 = 0.5685\n        Hour 7: [2.345, 2.381, -0.711, -0.604] -> (2.345+2.381-0.711-0.604)/4 = 3.411/4 = 0.85275\n        Hour 8: [2.239, 1.208, -0.036, -0.640] -> (2.239+1.208-0.036-0.640)/4 = 2.771/4 = 0.69275\n        Hour 9: [4.015, 2.239, -0.107, 0.036] -> (4.015+2.239-0.107+0.036)/4 = 6.183/4 = 1.54575\n        Hour 10: [4.655, 4.620, 0.071, -0.213] -> (4.655+4.620+0.071-0.213)/4 = 9.133/4 = 2.28325\n        Hour 11: [5.508, 4.939, -0.178, 0.036] -> (5.508+4.939-0.178+0.036)/4 = 10.305/4 = 2.57625\n        Hour 12: [4.122, 4.087, 2.239, -0.569] -> (4.122+4.087+2.239-0.569)/4 = 9.879/4 = 2.46975\n        Hour 13: [3.625, 5.437, 0.320, -0.569] -> (3.625+5.437+0.320-0.569)/4 = 8.813/4 = 2.20325\n        Hour 14: [5.757, 2.701, 2.630, -0.497] -> (5.757+2.701+2.630-0.497)/4 = 10.591/4 = 2.64775\n        Hour 15: [4.051, 1.421, 0.284, -1.031] -> (4.051+1.421+0.284-1.031)/4 = 4.725/4 = 1.18125\n        Hour 16: [2.203, 1.457, -0.071, -0.533] -> (2.203+1.457-0.071-0.533)/4 = 3.056/4 = 0.764\n        Hour 17: [1.812, -1.741, -0.569, -1.173] -> (1.812-1.741-0.569-1.173)/4 = -1.671/4 = -0.41775\n        Hour 18: [0.569, -2.132, -1.564, -1.457] -> (0.569-2.132-1.564-1.457)/4 = -4.584/4 = -1.146\n        Hour 19: [0.426, -1.670, -1.706, -2.416] -> (0.426-1.670-1.706-2.416)/4 = -5.366/4 = -1.3415\n        Hour 20: [0.284, -1.528, -1.350, -1.457] -> (0.284-1.528-1.350-1.457)/4 = -4.051/4 = -1.01275\n        Hour 21: [0.213, -1.457, -1.990, -1.919] -> (0.213-1.457-1.990-1.919)/4 = -5.153/4 = -1.28825\n        Hour 22: [0.853, -1.244, -1.528, -0.462] -> (0.853-1.244-1.528-0.462)/4 = -2.381/4 = -0.59525\n        Hour 23: [1.706, -0.036, -0.817, 0.213] -> (1.706-0.036-0.817+0.213)/4 = 1.066/4 = 0.2665\n\n 22. Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the above 24 averages for each day.\n\n 23. The dates:\n        Start: 2017-07-08 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-07-07 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-07-08 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n 24. We generate the data:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-07-08\n           00:00:00 -> 1.16375\n           01:00:00 -> 1.51025\n           ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.2665\n\n        Day 2: 2017-07-09: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2017-07-10: same\n        Day 4: 2017-07-11: same\n\n 25. We must output the same precision? The input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be as specified.\n\n 27. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-08 00:00:00  1.164\n2017-07-08 01:00:00  1.510\n...\n2017-07-11 23:00:00  0.267\n```\n\n 28. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Let's write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 30. We note: the rounding should be done appropriately.\n\n 31. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                current_date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                value = hourly_avg[hour]   # which we computed above\n\n 32. But note: we are generating 4 days, so 4*24=96.\n\n 33. We have the list of hourly averages (24 values) as:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            1.16375, 1.51025, 1.04825, 1.288, 1.0395, 0.835, 0.5685, 0.85275, \n            0.69275, 1.54575, 2.28325, 2.57625, 2.46975, 2.20325, 2.64775, 1.18125,\n            0.764, -0.41775, -1.146, -1.3415, -1.01275, -1.28825, -0.59525, 0.2665\n        ]\n\n 34. Now, we round each to 3 decimal places:\n\n        [round(x, 3) for x in hourly_avg]\n\n        Hour0: 1.164\n        Hour1: 1.510\n        ... \n\n 35. We write the output.\n\n 36. However, note: the data we are forecasting is for the next 96 hours, which is 4 days. We are using the same pattern for each day.\n\n 37. Let's generate the data:\n\n        Day 1: 8th July 2017: \n            00:00:00 -> 1.164\n            01:00:00 -> 1.510\n            ... \n            23:00:00 -> 0.267   (because 0.2665 rounded to 3 decimals is 0.267)\n\n        Day 2: 9th July 2017: same pattern\n        Day 3: 10th July 2017: same\n        Day 4: 11th July 2017: same\n\n 38. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns, the date string and the value.\n\n 39. We write the code to generate the dates and the values.\n\n 40. We note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 41. We'll create a list of the next 96 dates starting from 2017-07-08 00:00:00.\n\n 42. We assign the value for each hour by the index of the hour in the day (0 to 23) and then repeat for each day.\n\n 43. We output the data.\n\n 44. Let's do it.\n\n 45. We must be cautious: the rounding. For example, 0.2665 rounded to 3 decimals: \n        0.2665 * 1000 = 266.5 -> rounded to 267 -> 0.267\n\n 46. We'll round each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 48. We note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must not skip any hour.\n\n 49. We generate the 96 lines.\n\n 50. We output inside the <answer> tag and within triple backticks.\n\n 51. We code the solution in our mind and then write the output.\n\n 52. We have the hourly averages (rounded to 3 decimals) as:\n\n        [1.164, 1.510, 1.048, 1.288, 1.040, 0.835, 0.569, 0.853, \n         0.693, 1.546, 2.283, 2.576, 2.470, 2.203, 2.648, 1.181,\n         0.764, -0.418, -1.146, -1.342, -1.013, -1.288, -0.595, 0.267]\n\n 53. Now, we write the 96 lines:\n\n        Line 1: \"2017-07-08 00:00:00  1.164\"\n        Line 2: \"2017-07-08 01:00:00  1.510\"\n        ...\n        Line 24: \"2017-07-08 23:00:00  0.267\"\n        Line 25: \"2017-07-09 00:00:00  1.164\"\n        ... and so on.\n\n 54.
