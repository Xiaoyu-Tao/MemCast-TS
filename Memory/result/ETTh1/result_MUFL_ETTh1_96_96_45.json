        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the provided data for 2016-12-31 is constant (all 10.376). This might be an anomaly or missing data pattern? \n But the problem states that the data has missing values, so we must be cautious.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 96 points: \n   Dec 28: 24 hours\n   Dec 29: 24 hours\n   Dec 30: 24 hours\n   Dec 31: 24 hours\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours: from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n 3. Since the data on Dec 31 is constant, we must consider that this might be an artifact (like the transformer was offline?).\n    However, without more context, we have to proceed.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model. Given the small data (only 96 points) and the presence of potential seasonality (daily pattern),\n    we can try to model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we might use a simple method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the last observed value at the same hour of the previous day.\n    - But note: the last day (Dec 31) is constant, so if we use the last day we get a constant forecast.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour from the previous three days (Dec 28, 29, 30) to avoid the constant effect.\n\n 7. However, let's look at the data:\n\n    Dec 28: has variation\n    Dec 29: has variation\n    Dec 30: has variation\n    Dec 31: constant -> this is likely an issue.\n\n 8. Since the problem says there are missing values, we might consider the constant value as missing. But the problem does not specify which points are missing.\n\n 9. Approach:\n\n    We can treat the entire Dec 31 as missing and then use the data from Dec 28, 29, 30 to forecast.\n\n    How?\n      - We have 3 days of data (each 24 hours) without the constant pattern.\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour of the day over Dec 28, 29, 30 and then use that as the forecast for each day in the future.\n\n    For example:\n        Hour 00:00: average of [10.874 (28th), 10.909 (29th), 11.798 (30th)] = (10.874+10.909+11.798)/3 = 11.193666...\n        Then for each day in the forecast period (Jan 1 to Jan 4) at 00:00, we use 11.194 (rounded appropriately)\n\n    But note: the data has 3 decimal places, so we can round to 3 decimals.\n\n 10. Why not use Dec 31? Because it is constant and likely an anomaly. If we include it, it would pull the average towards 10.376 and we would lose the pattern.\n\n 11. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but it doesn't specify which. We are not told to impute the past, only to forecast the future.\n\n 12. We are only been asked to forecast the next 96 points. We are not required to impute the past.\n\n 13. But note: the forecast might be influenced by the last day? However, the last day is constant and not representative.\n\n 14. Considering the above, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the first three days (Dec 28, 29, 30) to forecast each hour for the next 4 days.\n\n 15. Steps for each hour of the day (0 to 23):\n\n        Let h in [0,23]:\n            values = [ value at h on Dec 28, Dec 29, Dec 30 ]\n            avg_h = round(mean(values), 3)\n\n        Then for each day in the forecast period (Jan 1, Jan 2, Jan 3, Jan 4), the value at hour h will be avg_h.\n\n 16. This will give us a forecast that repeats the same daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. Generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-01 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-01 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-01 23:00:00 -> day 1\n        Then 2017-01-02 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> day 2\n        Then 2017-01-03 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> day 3\n        Then 2017-01-04 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> day 4\n\n 18. We'll compute the 24 hourly averages from the first three days and then repeat that pattern 4 times.\n\n 19. Example calculation for hour 0 (00:00):\n\n        Dec 28: 10.874\n        Dec 29: 10.909\n        Dec 30: 11.798\n        Average = (10.874 + 10.909 + 11.798) / 3 = 33.581 / 3 = 11.193666... -> 11.194 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n     But note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 20. However, let's check the rounding: \n        10.874 + 10.909 = 21.783; 21.783 + 11.798 = 33.581; 33.581 / 3 = 11.193666... -> 11.194\n\n 21. We'll do this for every hour.\n\n 22. But note: the data for Dec 30 at 14:00 and 15:00 are 4.371 and 4.229? That seems low compared to the same hour on Dec 28 and 29.\n\n     We are not adjust for anomalies in the past? We are just taking the average.\n\n 23. We proceed with the average.\n\n 24. Let's compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (10.874 + 10.909 + 11.798) / 3 = 11.193667 -> 11.194\n      Hour 1: (10.270 + 9.666 + 12.402) / 3 = 32.338 / 3 = 10.779333 -> 10.779\n      Hour 2: (9.808 + 11.584 + 10.589) / 3 = 31.981 / 3 = 10.660333 -> 10.660\n      Hour 3: (9.772 + 11.655 + 11.442) / 3 = 32.869 / 3 = 10.956333 -> 10.956\n      Hour 4: (10.127 + 11.762 + 8.386) / 3 = 30.275 / 3 = 10.091667 -> 10.092\n      Hour 5: (8.209 + 11.655 + 10.127) / 3 = 29.991 / 3 = 9.997 -> 9.997\n      Hour 6: (9.061 + 12.473 + 10.234) / 3 = 31.768 / 3 = 10.589333 -> 10.589\n      Hour 7: (10.447 + 9.523 + 10.518) / 3 = 30.488 / 3 = 10.162667 -> 10.163\n      Hour 8: (8.990 + 9.168 + 10.483) / 3 = 28.641 / 3 = 9.547 -> 9.547\n      Hour 9: (6.858 + 7.747 + 6.432) / 3 = 21.037 / 3 = 7.012333 -> 7.012\n      Hour 10: (7.782 + 7.107 + 5.863) / 3 = 20.752 / 3 = 6.917333 -> 6.917\n      Hour 11: (7.498 + 7.569 + 5.934) / 3 = 21.001 / 3 = 7.000333 -> 7.000\n      Hour 12: (5.899 + 5.437 + 4.442) / 3 = 15.778 / 3 = 5.259333 -> 5.259\n      Hour 13: (6.929 + 5.579 + 5.082) / 3 = 17.59 / 3 = 5.863333 -> 5.863\n      Hour 14: (7.676 + 6.503 + 4.371) / 3 = 18.55 / 3 = 6.183333 -> 6.183\n      Hour 15: (5.650 + 7.107 + 4.229) / 3 = 16.986 / 3 = 5.662 -> 5.662\n      Hour 16: (6.610 + 5.970 + 5.401) / 3 = 17.981 / 3 = 5.993667 -> 5.994\n      Hour 17: (7.427 + 7.214 + 6.929) / 3 = 21.57 / 3 = 7.190 -> 7.190\n      Hour 18: (6.574 + 7.178 + 6.929) / 3 = 20.681 / 3 = 6.893667 -> 6.894\n      Hour 19: (6.823 + 7.285 + 7.036) / 3 = 21.144 / 3 = 7.048 -> 7.048\n      Hour 20: (6.396 + 6.645 + 6.503) / 3 = 19.544 / 3 = 6.514667 -> 6.515\n      Hour 21: (7.782 + 8.244 + 7.214) / 3 = 23.24 / 3 = 7.746667 -> 7.747\n      Hour 22: (10.447 + 10.554 + 8.742) / 3 = 29.743 / 3 = 9.914333 -> 9.914\n      Hour 23: (10.270 + 10.056 + 9.701) / 3 = 30.027 / 3 = 10.009 -> 10.009\n\n 25. Now, we create the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating these 24 values 4 times.\n\n 26. The dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-01 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-01-02 00:00:00 to 2017-01-02 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-01-03 00:00:00 to 2017-01-03 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-01-04 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00\n\n 27. We output the data in the same format: two columns (date and MUFL) with the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 28. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 29. Let's write the data:\n\n        First row: 2017-01-01 00:00:00, 11.194\n        Second row: 2017-01-01 01:00:00, 10.779\n        ... until hour 23: 2017-01-01 23:00:00, 10.009\n\n        Then day 2: same pattern.\n\n 30. We note that the last day of the provided data is 2016, so we are going to 2017.\n\n 31. We must be cautious: the data provided ends at 2016-12-31 23:00:00, so the next hour is 2017-01-01 00:00:00.\n\n 32. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 33. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not given any missing values in the provided 96 points? \n     But the last day is constant, which we treated as an anomaly and did not use. We are only using the first three days.\n\n 34. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 35. We output the data as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate, MUFL\n2017-01-01 00:00:00,11.194\n2017-01-01 01:00:00,10.779\n2017-01-01 02:00:00,10.660\n2017-01-01 03:00:00,10.956\n2017-01-01 04:00:00,10.092\n2017-01-01 05:00:00,9.997\n2017-01-01 06:00:00,10.589\n2017-01-01 07:00:00,10.163\n2017-01-01 08:00:00,9.547\n2017-01-01 09:00:00,7.012\n2017-01-01 10:00:00,6.917\n2017-01-01 11:00:00,7.000\n2017-01-01 12:00:00,5.259\n2017-01-01 13:00:00,5.863\n2017-01-01 14:00:00,6.183\n2017-01-01 15:00:00,5.662\n2017-01-01 16:00:00,5.994\n2017-01-01 17:00:00,7.190\n2017-01-01 18:00:00,6.894\n2017-01-01 19:00:00,7.048\n2017-01-01 20:00:00,6.515\n2017-01-01 21:00:00,7.747\n2017-01-01 22:00:00,9.914\n2017-01-01 23:00:00,10.009\n2017-01-02 00:00:00,11.194\n2017-01-02 01:00:00,10.779\n2017-01-02 02:00:00,10.660\n2017-01-02 03:00:00,10.956\n2017-01-02 04:00:00,10.092\n2017-01-02 05:00:00,9.997\n2017-01-02 06:00:00,10.589\n2017-01-02 07:00:00,10.163\n2017-01-02 08:00:00,9.547\n2017-01-02 09:00:00,7.012\n2017-01-02 10:00:00,6.917\n2017-01-02 11:00:00,7.000\n2017-01-02 12:00:00,5.259\n2017-01-02 13:00:00,5.863\n2017-01-02 14:00:00,6.183\n2017-01-02 15:00:00,5.662\n2017-01-02 16:00:00,5.994\n2017-01-02 17:00:00,7.190\n2017-01-02 18:00:00,6.894\n2017-01-02 19:00:00,7.048\n2017-01-02 20:00:00,6.515\n2017-01-02 21:00:00,7.747\n2017-01-02 22:00:00,9.914\n2017-01-02 23:00:00,10.009\n2017-01-03 00:00:00,11.194\n2017-01-03 01:00:00,10.779\n2017-01-03 02:00:00,10.660\n2017-01-03 03:00:00,10.956\n2017-01-03 04:00:00,10.092\n2017-01-03 05:00:00,9.997\n2017-01-03 06:00:00,10.589\n2017-01-03 07:00:00,10.163\n2017-01-03 08:00:00,9.547\n2017-01-03 09:00:00,7.012\n2017-01-03 10:00:00,6.917\n2017-01-03 11:00:00,7.000\n2017-01-03 12:00:00,5.259\n2017-01-03 13:00:00,5.863\n2017-01-03 14:00:00,6.183\n2017-01-03 15:00:00,5.662\n2017-01-03 16:00:00,5.994\n2017-01-03 17:00:00,7.190\n2017-01-03 18:00:00,6.894\n2017-01-03 19:00:00,7.048\n2017-01-03 20:00:00,6.515\n2017-01-03 21:00:00,7.747\n2017-01-03 22:00:00,9.914\n2017-01-03 23:00:00,10.009\n2017-01-04 00:00:00,11.194\n2017-01-04 01:00:00,10.779\n2017-01-04 02:00:00,10.660\n2017-01-04 03:00:00,10.956\n2017-01-04 04:00:00,10.092\n2017-01-04 05:00:00,9.997\n2017-01-04 06:00:00,10.589\n2017-01-04 07:00:00,10.163\n2017-01-04 08:00:00,9.547\n2017-01-04 09:00:00,7.012\n2017-01-04 10:00:00,6.917\n2017-01-04 11:00:00,7.000\n2017-01-04 12:00:00,5.259\n2017-01-04 13:00:00,5.863\n2017-01-04 14:00:00,6.183\n2017-01-04 15:00:00,5.662\n2017-01-04 16:00:00,5.994\n2017-01-04 17:00:00,7.190\n2017-01-04 18:00:00,6.894\n2017-01-04 19:00:00,7.048\n2017-01-04 20:00:00,6.515\n2017-01-04 21:00:00,7.747\n2017-01-04 22:00:00,9.914\n2017-01-04 23:00:00,10.009\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 36.
