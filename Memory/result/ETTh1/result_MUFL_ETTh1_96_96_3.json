        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00.\n The data has 96 records (4 days * 24 hours).\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we have consecutive hourly data without gaps. So we can proceed by using the given data as a complete series for the past 96 hours.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the daily cycles), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small amount of data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast the next 4 days, we can consider using a model that uses daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n 4. We can use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, where the forecast for each hour of the day is the last observed value for that same hour. However, we only have 4 days of data, so we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided segment we don't have any. So we can use the last available cycle (the last day) to forecast the next day? Or we can use the average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components. However, with only 96 points, we can also try a simple average by hour.\n\n 6. Since the problem does not specify the method, we are to provide a forecast. We'll choose a method that is simple and robust.\n\n Approach:\n\n We will compute the average of each hour of the day over the available 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to see weekly (only 4 days, which are consecutive and include two weekdays and then the weekend? 2016-07-13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday). The next 4 days would be Sunday (17), Monday (18), Tuesday (19), Wednesday (20). So we might expect a different pattern on Sunday and then weekdays.\n\n However, we only have one Saturday (16th) and no Sunday, Monday, etc. So we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we will assume that the pattern is daily and ignore the day of the week.\n\n We can do:\n\n   For hour h (0 to 23), let the historical values for that hour be the 4 values we have (from the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th). Then the forecast for hour h on the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th will be the average of the 4 historical values for that hour.\n\n But note: the data on the 16th (Saturday) might be different. However, without more data we cannot adjust for weekly seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the pattern for Sunday? But we don't know. Since we have to make a forecast, we'll use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n However, let's look at the data: the last day (16th) has generally lower values? For example, at 00:00: 6.717 (13th), 11.194 (14th), 8.422 (15th), 6.645 (16th). The average for 00:00 would be (13.717+11.194+8.422+6.645)/4 = 10.0 (approx). But the next day (17th) being Sunday might be even lower? We don't have data to confirm.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the forecast of the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't have any missing values, so we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n\n   For hour h in [0,23]:\n        values = [ value at hour h on 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th ]\n        avg_h = average(values)\n\n   Then for each day in the next 4 days (17th, 18th, 19th, 20th), the forecast for hour h is avg_h.\n\n However, this will give the same 24 values repeated for each of the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n   Day 1 (13th): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n   Day 2: similarly\n   Day 3: \n   Day 4:\n\n We can compute:\n\n   Day1: 13th: average = (13.717+12.189+...+10.980)/24 = let's not compute by hand, but we can see a pattern: higher at night and lower during the day? and the level seems to be decreasing? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average to capture the level and then add the seasonal component? But again, we are limited by data.\n\n Since we are only asked for the next 96 points, and we have to provide a complete set, we'll use the average by hour.\n\n However, we note that the level of the 16th is lower than the 13th. So if we average, we are taking a level that is in between. This might be acceptable.\n\n Let's do it:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00): \n        13th: 13.717\n        14th: 11.194\n        15th: 8.422\n        16th: 6.645\n        average = (13.717+11.194+8.422+6.645)/4 = 9.9945\n\n   Similarly for hour 1 (01:00):\n        12.189, 10.874, 8.280, 8.031 -> (12.189+10.874+8.280+8.031)/4 = 9.8435\n\n   And so on.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, each day we will have the same 24 values (the 24 averages).\n\n   So the forecast for:\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00: 9.9945\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00: 9.8435\n        ... until 23:00\n\n   and then repeat the same 24 numbers for the 18th, 19th, 20th.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not told about missing values in the forecast period? We are only to forecast. We assume that we are to provide 96-point forecast without missing values.\n\n 8. We must output the complete data for the next 96 dates, which are:\n\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00\n\n 9. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then create 4 copies of these 24.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse the given data and group by hour of day.\n\n   We have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean.\n\n   Step 3: Create the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-17 00:00:00 (the next after 2016-07-16 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-07-17 01:00:00 ... up to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 4: Assign the mean values for the corresponding hour of the day, and repeat for 4 days.\n\n 10. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to model a trend. We are not doing a trend extrapolation.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the forecast for Sunday? But then Monday might be different? We don't have data. So we stick to the average.\n\n 12. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [13.717, 11.194, 8.422, 6.645] -> mean = (13.717+11.194+8.422+6.645)/4 = 9.9945\n        hour1: [12.189, 10.874, 8.280, 8.031] -> (12.189+10.874+8.280+8.031)/4 = 9.8435\n        hour2: [12.722, 9.523, 8.990, 8.742] -> (12.722+9.523+8.990+8.742)/4 = 9.99425\n        hour3: [11.371, 10.661, 7.711, 7.640] -> (11.371+10.661+7.711+7.640)/4 = 9.34575\n        hour4: [13.468, 8.848, 7.107, 7.320] -> (13.468+8.848+7.107+7.320)/4 = 9.18575\n        hour5: [13.397, 9.275, 7.498, 7.853] -> (13.397+9.275+7.498+7.853)/4 = 9.50575\n        hour6: [10.518, 9.559, 6.361, 7.604] -> (10.518+9.559+6.361+7.604)/4 = 8.5105\n        hour7: [8.066, 5.863, 6.005, 4.122] -> (8.066+5.863+6.005+4.122)/4 = 6.014\n        hour8: [6.929, 5.970, 6.183, 4.939] -> (6.929+5.970+6.183+4.939)/4 = 6.00525\n        hour9: [6.752, 5.863, 7.036, 5.117] -> (6.752+5.863+7.036+5.117)/4 = 6.192\n        hour10: [6.610, 6.503, 6.965, 6.396] -> (6.610+6.503+6.965+6.396)/4 = 6.6185\n        hour11: [6.503, 6.858, 7.320, 6.432] -> (6.503+6.858+7.320+6.432)/4 = 6.77825\n        hour12: [5.721, 5.686, 5.721, 4.264] -> (5.721+5.686+5.721+4.264)/4 = 5.348\n        hour13: [6.041, 6.005, 6.112, 4.548] -> (6.041+6.005+6.112+4.548)/4 = 5.6765\n        hour14: [6.041, 5.401, 6.361, 4.939] -> (6.041+5.401+6.361+4.939)/4 = 5.6855\n        hour15: [6.219, 10.021, 5.792, 5.828] -> (6.219+10.021+5.792+5.828)/4 = 6.965\n        hour16: [5.721, 5.295, 5.508, 5.330] -> (5.721+5.295+5.508+5.330)/4 = 5.4635\n        hour17: [5.970, 4.620, 5.579, 5.366] -> (5.970+4.620+5.579+5.366)/4 = 5.38375\n        hour18: [5.721, 3.980, 4.620, 4.477] -> (5.721+3.980+4.620+4.477)/4 = 4.6995\n        hour19: [5.863, 5.188, 4.442, 4.229] -> (5.863+5.188+4.442+4.229)/4 = 4.9305\n        hour20: [7.178, 5.686, 4.762, 4.975] -> (7.178+5.686+4.762+4.975)/4 = 5.65025\n        hour21: [8.599, 5.224, 6.219, 4.584] -> (8.599+5.224+6.219+4.584)/4 = 6.1565\n        hour22: [9.630, 5.437, 7.569, 6.005] -> (9.630+5.437+7.569+6.005)/4 = 7.16025\n        hour23: [10.980, 7.640, 7.640, 5.366] -> (10.980+7.640+7.640+5.366)/4 = 7.9065\n\n 13. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-07-17: from hour0 to hour23: [9.9945, 9.8435, 9.99425, 9.34575, 9.18575, 9.50575, 8.5105, 6.014, 6.00525, 6.192, 6.6185, 6.77825, 5.348, 5.6765, 5.6855, 6.965, 5.4635, 5.38375, 4.6995, 4.9305, 5.65025, 6.1565, 7.16025, 7.9065]\n\n        Day 2: 2016-07-18: same 24 numbers\n        Day 3: 2016-07-19: same\n        Day 4: 2016-07-20: same\n\n 14. Format the output: We must output the date and the forecasted value, with the date in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 15. We note that the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 16. Write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any in the provided 96, so we used all. But if there were missing values in the original data, we would have to impute. But the problem does not specify any in the provided segment.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 7, 17, 0, 0, 0)\n        then add 96 hours.\n\n   Then assign the values = [ \n        9.9945, 9.8435, 9.99425, 9.34575, 9.18575, 9.50575, 8.5105, 6.014, 6.00525, 6.192, 6.6185, 6.77825, \n        5.348, 5.6765, 5.6855, 6.965, 5.4635, 5.38375, 4.6995, 4.9305, 5.65025, 6.1565, 7.16025, 7.9065\n    ]\n\n   and then repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 17. Round each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n 18. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00, [rounded_value1]\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00, [rounded_value2]\n        ...\n        2016-07-20 23:00:00, [rounded_value96]\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the example input had a space after the colon? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2016-07-13 00:00:00 13.717\"\n\n However, in the output we are to provide the same format? The example input in the problem was:\n\n        \"2016-07-13 00:00:00 13.717\"\n\n But in the provided data, it was:\n\n        \"2016-07-13 00:00:00 13.717\"\n\n with a space between date and time? Actually, the example has two spaces: one between date and time and one between time and value? But the data is given with a space separation? Actually, the data is given in a fixed width? \n\n However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\" and then shows:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n And the example data points in the problem are given as:\n\n        \"2016-07-13 00:00:00 13.717\"\n\n So we output: \n\n        [date string] [space] [value]\n\n But note: the value in the example had a space and then the number. However, the example also had a header: \"date   MUFL\", so we are not to output the header? The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning just the data rows.\n\n 19. We output 96 rows, each row: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS X.XXX\" (with the value rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n 20. Let's round the averages to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 9.9945 -> 9.994\n        hour1: 9.8435 -> 9.844\n        hour2: 9.99425 -> 9.994\n        hour3: 9.34575 -> 9.346\n        hour4: 9.18575 -> 9.186\n        hour5: 9.50575 -> 9.506\n        hour6: 8.5105 -> 8.511\n        hour7: 6.014 -> 6.014\n        hour8: 6.00525 -> 6.005\n        hour9: 6.192 -> 6.192\n        hour10: 6.6185 -> 6.619\n        hour11: 6.77825 -> 6.778\n        hour12: 5.348 -> 5.348\n        hour13: 5.6765 -> 5.677\n        hour14: 5.6855 -> 5.686\n        hour15: 6.965 -> 6.965\n        hour16: 5.4635 -> 5.464\n        hour17: 5.38375 -> 5.384\n        hour18: 4.6995 -> 4.700\n        hour19: 4.9305 -> 4.931\n        hour20: 5.65025 -> 5.650\n        hour21: 6.1565 -> 6.157\n        hour22: 7.16025 -> 7.160\n        hour23: 7.9065 -> 7.907\n\n 21. Now, the list of 24 values for one day:\n\n        [9.994, 9.844, 9.994, 9.346, 9.186, 9.506, 8.511, 6.014, 6.005, 6.192, 6.619, 6.778, \n         5.348, 5.677, 5.686, 6.965, 5.464, 5.384, 4.700, 4.931, 5.650, 6.157, 7.160, 7.907]\n\n 22. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00\n\n 23. Code for generating:\n\n        import datetime  [But note: we are not running code, we are writing the output]\n\n        We can do:\n\n        start = datetime.datetime(2016,7,17,0,0,0)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                timestamp = start + datetime.timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # but note: we are adding day and then hour? Actually, we can do:\n                # total_hours = day*24 + hour\n                # then: start + datetime.timedelta(hours=total_hours)\n\n        But we'll do:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            current = start + datetime.timedelta(hours=i)\n            date_str = current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            value = ... # the value at position (i mod 24) in the list above\n\n 24. However, we are to write the data without code. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 25. We note: the first 24 hours: 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> use the list above in order.\n\n        Then the next 24: same list.\n\n 26. We output:\n\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00 9.994\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00 9.844\n        ...\n        2016-07-17 23:00:00 7.907\n        2016-07-18 00:00:00 9.994\n        ... and so on.\n\n 27. We must be cautious: the rounding might have introduced a small discrepancy, but it's acceptable.\n\n 28.
