        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the MULL (Middle UseLess Load) from 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-03-02 00:00:00 to 2017-03-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (as per the given data).\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data size (96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we can use models like:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Exponential Smoothing\n    - Prophet (if we suspect seasonality)\n 4. However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can see:\n    - During the night (around 18:00 to 23:00) the load becomes more negative (dips).\n    - During the day (especially in the morning) it rises.\n\n 5. Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 6. We'll use SARIMA because it can capture both the autoregressive, moving average, and seasonal components.\n\n 7. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We have to set the seasonal period: since data is hourly and we see a pattern every 24 hours, we set seasonal period s=24.\n    - We need to determine the non-seasonal (p,d,q) and seasonal (P,D,Q) parameters.\n\n 8. We can perform a grid search for the best parameters, but due to the small data size and the fact that we are to generate the forecast without user interaction, we choose a reasonable set.\n\n 9. Observing the data: \n    - The series does not appear to have a trend (it oscillates around zero) so we might set d=0 or d=1 (to be safe) and D=1 for the seasonal part (since the seasonal pattern is strong and we might need to difference once at lag 24).\n\n 10. We can try: \n     - Non-seasonal: p=1, d=0, q=1\n     - Seasonal: P=1, D=1, Q=1, s=24\n\n 11. However, note that the data is only 96 points (4 days) so we have limited data. We must be cautious not to overfit.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: \n      - Since the data is short, we might use a seasonal naive model (using the value from the same time in the previous day) for the next 24 hours and then repeat? But that would be just repeating the last day, which might not capture the pattern well.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will use the SARIMA` model with the parameters (1,0,1)(1,1,1)[24].\n\n 14. We must handle any missing values, but in the provided data there are none. However, the problem states that the data may have missing values. Since we are only the given 96 points and they are complete, we proceed.\n\n 15. We will use the `statsmodels` library to fit the SARIMA model. But note: we are to generate the forecast without running code, so we have to simulate the process.\n\n 16. However, as an AI, I can simulate the forecast by generating a pattern that follows the historical data.\n\n 17. Given the constraints, we can generate a forecast by:\n      - Extracting the daily pattern (by averaging the 4 days we have for each hour) and then adding some noise? But that would ignore the autoregressive structure.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour to form the next 4 days (96 hours). \n\n 19. Steps for the averaging method:\n      - We have 4 days: 2017-02-26, 2017-02-27, 2017-02-28, 2017-03-01.\n      - For each hour (0 to 23) we compute the average of the 4 days for that hour.\n      - Then we use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days (from 2017-03-02 to 2017-03-05).\n\n 20. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days (all in the same week) so we cannot capture weekly. Also, the problem does not specify.\n\n 21. However, the averaging method is simple and might capture the daily pattern.\n\n 22. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: (0.142 + (-0.604) + (-1.066) + (-1.741)) / 4 = (0.142 -0.604 -1.066 -1.741)/4 = (-3.269)/4 = -0.81725\n      Hour 1: (0.213 + (-0.746) + (-0.355) + (-1.315)) / 4 = (0.213 -0.746 -0.355 -1.315)/4 = (-2.203)/4 = -0.55075\n      ... and so on.\n\n 23. Then we assign:\n      2017-03-02 00:00:00 -> average for hour0 = -0.81725\n      2017-03-02 01:00:00 -> average for hour1 = -0.55075\n      ... until 2017-03-02 23:00:00 -> average for hour23\n      and then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 24. But note: the last day in the data (2017-03-01) might be more representative? However, we are averaging to smooth out any daily variations.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-01) and then adjust by the average daily pattern? But that might be more complex.\n\n 26. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, we choose the averaging method.\n\n 27. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any in the provided 96, so we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n 28. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n      We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n      Let's break the data into 4 days (each day 24 hours):\n\n        Day1: indices 0-23: [0.142, 0.213, 0.533, ... , -0.355]\n        Day2: indices 24-47: [-0.604, -0.746, ... , -1.421]\n        Day3: indices 48-71: [-1.066, -0.355, ... , -1.670]\n        Day4: indices 72-95: [-1.741, -1.315, ... , -0.711]\n\n 29. We compute:\n\n        hour0: (0.142 + (-0.604) + (-1.066) + (-1.741)) / 4 = -0.81725\n        hour1: (0.213 + (-0.746) + (-0.355) + (-1.315)) / 4 = -0.55075\n        hour2: (0.533 + (-1.102) + (-0.924) + (-1.670)) / 4 = (0.533 -1.102 -0.924 -1.670)/4 = (-3.163)/4 = -0.79075\n        hour3: (-0.284 + 0.107 + (-0.320) + (-1.457)) /4 = (-0.284+0.107-0.320-1.457)/4 = (-1.954)/4 = -0.4885\n        hour4: (-1.350 + 0.036 + (-0.924) + (-1.421)) /4 = (-1.350+0.036-0.924-1.421)/4 = (-3.659)/4 = -0.91475\n        hour5: (-0.924 + (-0.213) + (-0.533) + (-2.132)) /4 = (-0.924-0.213-0.533-2.132)/4 = (-3.802)/4 = -0.9505\n        hour6: (-0.391 + (-0.995) + (-0.924) + (-1.848)) /4 = (-0.391-0.995-0.924-1.848)/4 = (-4.158)/4 = -1.0395\n        hour7: (0.142 + 0.107 + (-0.497) + (-1.208)) /4 = (0.142+0.107-0.497-1.208)/4 = (-1.456)/4 = -0.364\n        hour8: (0.746 + (-0.142) + (-0.142) + (-0.711)) /4 = (0.746-0.142-0.142-0.711)/4 = (-0.249)/4 = -0.06225\n        hour9: (-0.604 + (-0.320) + (-0.746) + (-1.386)) /4 = (-0.604-0.320-0.746-1.386)/4 = (-3.056)/4 = -0.764\n        hour10: (0.000 + (-0.711) + (-0.284) + (-0.888)) /4 = (0-0.711-0.284-0.888)/4 = (-1.883)/4 = -0.47075\n        hour11: (0.497 + 0.355 + 0.320 + (-0.959)) /4 = (0.497+0.355+0.320-0.959)/4 = (0.213)/4 = 0.05325\n        hour12: (-0.320 + (-0.355) + 0.178 + 0.071) /4 = (-0.320-0.355+0.178+0.071)/4 = (-0.426)/4 = -0.1065\n        hour13: (0.604 + 0.249 + (-0.284) + 0.675) /4 = (0.604+0.249-0.284+0.675)/4 = (1.244)/4 = 0.311\n        hour14: (0.142 + 0.142 + (-0.355) + 0.533) /4 = (0.142+0.142-0.355+0.533)/4 = (0.462)/4 = 0.1155\n        hour15: (-0.604 + (-0.497) + (-0.746) + (-0.213)) /4 = (-0.604-0.497-0.746-0.213)/4 = (-2.06)/4 = -0.515\n        hour16: (-0.924 + (-1.173) + (-1.386) + (-1.528)) /4 = (-0.924-1.173-1.386-1.528)/4 = (-5.011)/4 = -1.25275\n        hour17: (-1.777 + (-1.883) + (-1.883) + (-1.421)) /4 = (-1.777-1.883-1.883-1.421)/4 = (-6.964)/4 = -1.741\n        hour18: (-2.203 + (-2.416) + (-2.381) + (-2.310)) /4 = (-2.203-2.416-2.381-2.310)/4 = (-9.31)/4 = -2.3275\n        hour19: (-2.416 + (-2.381) + (-2.345) + (-2.274)) /4 = (-2.416-2.381-2.345-2.274)/4 = (-9.416)/4 = -2.354\n        hour20: (-2.523 + (-2.381) + (-2.345) + (-2.416)) /4 = (-2.523-2.381-2.345-2.416)/4 = (-9.665)/4 = -2.41625\n        hour21: (-2.949 + (-3.269) + (-2.736) + (-2.736)) /4 = (-2.949-3.269-2.736-2.736)/4 = (-11.69)/4 = -2.9225\n        hour22: (-1.599 + (-1.031) + (-2.594) + (-1.208)) /4 = (-1.599-1.031-2.594-1.208)/4 = (-6.432)/4 = -1.608\n        hour23: (-0.355 + (-1.421) + (-1.670) + (-0.711)) /4 = (-0.355-1.421-1.670-0.711)/4 = (-4.157)/4 = -1.03925\n\n 30. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 31. The dates start from 2017-03-02 00:00:00 and go to 2017-03-05 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We generate:\n\n        date: 2017-03-02 00:00:00 -> MULL = -0.81725\n        date: 2017-03-02 01:00:00 -> MULL = -0.55075\n        ... and so on.\n\n 33. We round to 3 decimal places as in the original data.\n\n 34. However, note that the original data has some variation. We are using the average for each hour, so the forecast will be the same pattern repeated. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 35. We write the forecast in the required format.\n\n 36. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but we are not given any in the input. We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 37. We output the next 96 points.\n\n 38. Let's write the data:\n\n      We'll create a list of dates starting from 2017-03-02 00:00:00 and then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 39. The first forecast point: 2017-03-02 00:00:00, then 2017-03-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-05 23:00:00.\n\n 40. We'll assign the hourly averages in order for each day.\n\n 41. We round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 42. The computed averages rounded:\n\n        hour0: -0.817 -> -0.817\n        hour1: -0.551 -> -0.551\n        hour2: -0.791 -> -0.791\n        hour3: -0.489 -> -0.489\n        hour4: -0.915 -> -0.915\n        hour5: -0.951 -> -0.951\n        hour6: -1.040 -> -1.040\n        hour7: -0.364 -> -0.364\n        hour8: -0.062 -> -0.062\n        hour9: -0.764 -> -0.764\n        hour10: -0.471 -> -0.471\n        hour11: 0.053 -> 0.053\n        hour12: -0.107 -> -0.107\n        hour13: 0.311 -> 0.311\n        hour14: 0.116 -> 0.116\n        hour15: -0.515 -> -0.515\n        hour16: -1.253 -> -1.253\n        hour17: -1.741 -> -1.741\n        hour18: -2.328 -> -2.328\n        hour19: -2.354 -> -2.354\n        hour20: -2.416 -> -2.416\n        hour21: -2.923 -> -2.923\n        hour22: -1.608 -> -1.608\n        hour23: -1.039 -> -1.039\n\n 43. Then we repeat this 24-hour pattern for 4 days.\n\n 44. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-02 00:00:00  -0.817\n2017-03-02 01:00:00  -0.551\n2017-03-02 02:00:00  -0.791\n2017-03-02 03:00:00  -0.489\n2017-03-02 04:00:00  -0.915\n2017-03-02 05:00:00  -0.951\n2017-03-02 06:00:00  -1.040\n2017-03-02 07:00:00  -0.364\n2017-03-02 08:00:00  -0.062\n2017-03-02 09:00:00  -0.764\n2017-03-02 10:00:00  -0.471\n2017-03-02 11:00:00   0.053\n2017-03-02 12:00:00  -0.107\n2017-03-02 13:00:00   0.311\n2017-03-02 14:00:00   0.116\n2017-03-02 15:00:00  -0.515\n2017-03-02 16:00:00  -1.253\n2017-03-02 17:00:00  -1.741\n2017-03-02 18:00:00  -2.328\n2017-03-02 19:00:00  -2.354\n2017-03-02 20:00:00  -2.416\n2017-03-02 21:00:00  -2.923\n2017-03-02 22:00:00  -1.608\n2017-03-02 23:00:00  -1.039\n2017-03-03 00:00:00  -0.817\n2017-03-03 01:00:00  -0.551\n... and so on for two more days.\n\n 45. We note that the pattern repeats exactly for each day.\n\n 46. We output the entire 96 points.\n\n 47. Since the problem requires the complete data and we must not omit any content, we write all 96 lines.\n\n 48. We format the dates correctly.\n\n 49.
