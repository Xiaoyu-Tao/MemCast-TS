        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 time steps ahead, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n Given the relatively small amount of data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon),\n we might consider using a model that can capture seasonality and trends.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - There seems to be a daily pattern (24-hour seasonality) because the data shows similar patterns each day.\n   - The values at night (e.g., around 00:00 to 05:00) are relatively higher than the afternoon (12:00 to 18:00) on some days, but the pattern is not entirely consistent.\n\n However, note that we only have 4 days of data. This is a very short series for training a complex model.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - A simple seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? \n     But note: the last day (2016-09-10) has a pattern that might be different from the previous days.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the 4 days? But 4 days is very few.\n\n   - Another idea: use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonality. However, with only 4 days, the seasonality period (24) is too long for the data.\n\n   - Given the challenge, we might use a naive method that repeats the last day (2016-09-10) for the next 4 days? \n     But note: the problem says the data has missing values, but we are not given any in the training set. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n   - However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", meaning in the future we might have missing values? \n     But we are only required to forecast the next 96 points. We are not given any missing values in the provided 96.\n\n   - We can use a linear model with time features (hour of day, day of week) but we only have 4 days, so day of week might not be captured.\n\n Considering the above, and the fact that we must provide 96 points, we decide to use a simple method:\n\n   We will use the average of each hour over the 4 available days to forecast the next 4 days (which are 4 * 24 = 96 hours).\n\n   Steps for the method:\n     - Group the data by the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n     - For each hour, compute the average of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n     - Then, for the next 96 hours (which are 4 days: 2016-09-11 to 2016-09-14), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   Why this method?\n     - It captures the daily seasonality by averaging the same hour.\n     - It is simple and robust with small data.\n\n   However, note that the last day (2016-09-10) has a Saturday and Sunday pattern? But we don't have enough days to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n   The dates provided:\n        2016-09-07: Wednesday\n        2016-09-08: Thursday\n        2016-09-09: Friday\n        2016-09-10: Saturday\n\n   The next 4 days: \n        2016-09-11: Sunday\n        2016-09-12: Monday\n        2016-09-13: Tuesday\n        2016-09-14: Wednesday\n\n   Since we don't have data for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we fall back to the daily average.\n\n   We assume that the daily pattern is similar regardless of the day of the week.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of the 96 provided points. Then, we'll group by the hour (ignoring the day).\n\n   For hour 0 (00:00): we have [6.965, 6.219, 10.341, 8.351] -> average = (6.965+6.219+10.341+8.351)/4 = 7.969\n   For hour 1 (01:00): [6.823, 6.894, 10.518, 8.742] -> (6.823+6.894+10.518+8.742)/4 = 8.24425\n\n   And so on.\n\n   Then, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start at 2016-09-11 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2016-09-10 23:00:00) and go up to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n   We assign:\n        2016-09-11 00:00:00 -> average for hour0 = 7.969\n        2016-09-11 01:00:00 -> average for hour1 = 8.24425\n        ... until 2016-09-11 23:00:00 -> average for hour23\n\n        Then 2016-09-12 00:00:00 -> average for hour0 = 7.969\n        and so on.\n\n   This will give 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n   We must format the dates correctly.\n\n   Note: The last provided date is 2016-09-10 23:00:00, so the next date is 2016-09-11 00:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours.\n\n   We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n   However, note: the data for the same hour might have a trend? But we don't have enough to capture that.\n\n   This method is simple and we are required to provide the data.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: (6.965 + 6.219 + 10.341 + 8.351) / 4 = (6.965+6.219=13.184; 13.184+10.341=23.525; 23.525+8.351=31.876) -> 31.876/4 = 7.969\n        hour1: (6.823 + 6.894 + 10.518 + 8.742) / 4 = (6.823+6.894=13.717; 13.717+10.518=24.235; 24.235+8.742=32.977) -> 32.977/4 = 8.24425\n        hour2: (6.929 + 6.432 + 10.945 + 9.452) / 4 = (6.929+6.432=13.361; 13.361+10.945=24.306; 24.306+9.452=33.758) -> 33.758/4 = 8.4395\n        hour3: (5.366 + 5.828 + 10.199 + 8.848) / 4 = (5.366+5.828=11.194; 11.194+10.199=21.393; 21.393+8.848=30.241) -> 30.241/4 = 7.56025\n        hour4: (6.894 + 5.650 + 10.767 + 8.564) / 4 = (6.894+5.650=12.544; 12.544+10.767=23.311; 23.311+8.564=31.875) -> 31.875/4 = 7.96875\n        hour5: (7.498 + 5.437 + 9.985 + 7.995) / 4 = (7.498+5.437=12.935; 12.935+9.985=22.92; 22.92+7.995=30.915) -> 30.915/4 = 7.72875\n        hour6: (8.422 + 7.214 + 10.092 + 8.031) / 4 = (8.422+7.214=15.636; 15.636+10.092=25.728; 25.728+8.031=33.759) -> 33.759/4 = 8.43975\n        hour7: (8.031 + 6.361 + 8.066 + 7.285) / 4 = (8.031+6.361=14.392; 14.392+8.066=22.458; 22.458+7.285=29.743) -> 29.743/4 = 7.43575\n        hour8: (6.432 + 5.899 + 8.528 + 8.457) / 4 = (6.432+5.899=12.331; 12.331+8.528=20.859; 20.859+8.457=29.316) -> 29.316/4 = 7.329\n        hour9: (5.579 + 6.148 + 7.498 + 6.538) / 4 = (5.579+6.148=11.727; 11.727+7.498=19.225; 19.225+6.538=25.763) -> 25.763/4 = 6.44075\n        hour10: (6.254 + 5.899 + 6.610 + 7.107) / 4 = (6.254+5.899=12.153; 12.153+6.610=18.763; 18.763+7.107=25.87) -> 25.87/4 = 6.4675\n        hour11: (5.579 + 6.005 + 6.219 + 7.249) / 4 = (5.579+6.005=11.584; 11.584+6.219=17.803; 17.803+7.249=25.052) -> 25.052/4 = 6.263\n        hour12: (3.909 + 4.371 + 4.868 + 4.939) / 4 = (3.909+4.371=8.28; 8.28+4.868=13.148; 13.148+4.939=18.087) -> 18.087/4 = 4.52175\n        hour13: (4.264 + 4.300 + 5.082 + 5.010) / 4 = (4.264+4.300=8.564; 8.564+5.082=13.646; 13.646+5.010=18.656) -> 18.656/4 = 4.664\n        hour14: (4.477 + 4.904 + 5.792 + 5.508) / 4 = (4.477+4.904=9.381; 9.381+5.792=15.173; 15.173+5.508=20.681) -> 20.681/4 = 5.17025\n        hour15: (4.442 + 5.330 + 6.325 + 5.472) / 4 = (4.442+5.330=9.772; 9.772+6.325=16.097; 16.097+5.472=21.569) -> 21.569/4 = 5.39225\n        hour16: (4.939 + 4.939 + 6.041 + 5.010) / 4 = (4.939+4.939=9.878; 9.878+6.041=15.919; 15.919+5.010=20.929) -> 20.929/4 = 5.23225\n        hour17: (4.975 + 5.188 + 6.005 + 6.148) / 4 = (4.975+5.188=10.163; 10.163+6.005=16.168; 16.168+6.148=22.316) -> 22.316/4 = 5.579\n        hour18: (4.442 + 4.477 + 4.904 + 4.975) / 4 = (4.442+4.477=8.919; 8.919+4.904=13.823; 13.823+4.975=18.798) -> 18.798/4 = 4.6995\n        hour19: (4.193 + 4.833 + 5.615 + 5.721) / 4 = (4.193+4.833=9.026; 9.026+5.615=14.641; 14.641+5.721=20.362) -> 20.362/4 = 5.0905\n        hour20: (4.442 + 4.904 + 5.259 + 5.366) / 4 = (4.442+4.904=9.346; 9.346+5.259=14.605; 14.605+5.366=19.971) -> 19.971/4 = 4.99275\n        hour21: (3.944 + 6.503 + 4.975 + 6.965) / 4 = (3.944+6.503=10.447; 10.447+4.975=15.422; 15.422+6.965=22.387) -> 22.387/4 = 5.59675\n        hour22: (3.589 + 8.138 + 7.071 + 9.594) / 4 = (3.589+8.138=11.727; 11.727+7.071=18.798; 18.798+9.594=28.392) -> 28.392/4 = 7.098\n        hour23: (5.792 + 9.346 + 8.386 + 10.518) / 4 = (5.792+9.346=15.138; 15.138+8.386=23.524; 23.524+10.518=34.042) -> 34.042/4 = 8.5105\n\n   Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-11 23:00:00 -> hours 0 to 23: [7.969, 8.24425, 8.4395, ... , 8.5105]\n        Day 2: 2016-09-12 00:00:00 to 2016-09-12 23:00:00 -> same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2016-09-13 00:00:00 to 2016-09-13 23:00:00 -> same\n        Day 4: 2016-09-14 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00 -> same\n\n   We'll write the numbers with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, note: the input has 3 decimal places, but our averages might have more.
