        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (as per the given data). However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data size (96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use models like:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Exponential Smoothing\n    - Prophet (if we had more data, but 96 points is a bit short for Prophet's seasonality)\n    - Simple methods like using the last known value, moving average, etc. but these are not sophisticated.\n\n 4. Considering the data, we observe:\n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, the load drops during the night and rises during the day.\n    - We have 4 days of data (96 hours) which is exactly 4 cycles.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we can try to model with a seasonal component. We have seasonality of 24 hours (frequency=24).\n\n 6. We can use a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day (i.e., 4th day: 2017-01-08).\n    However, note that the pattern might change and we have only 4 days. Alternatively, we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n 7. But note: the data from 2017-01-08 (the last day) has a different pattern? Let's compare:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-01-05): \n        00:00: 1.432, 01:00: 1.157, ... 23:00: 0.883\n    Day 2 (2017-01-06): \n        00:00: 0.670, ... 23:00: 0.701\n    Day 3 (2017-01-07): \n        00:00: 0.640, ... 23:00: 0.914\n    Day 4 (2017-01-08): \n        00:00: 0.975, ... 23:00: 0.731\n\n    The values at the same hour vary. We can compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a more robust method: Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA). However, with only 4 days, the model might not be very stable.\n\n 9. Considering the requirement and the simplicity, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the forecast of the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        - For hour 00:00: (1.432 + 0.670 + 0.640 + 0.975) / 4 = (4.717)/4 = 1.17925\n        - For hour 01:00: (1.157 + 0.701 + 0.609 + 0.853) / 4 = (3.32)/4 = 0.83\n        - ... and so on for each of the 24 hours.\n\n    Then, we repeat these 24 averaged values for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 10. But note: the last day (2017-01-08) has a higher load during the day? We see on 2017-01-08 at 14:00:00: 1.736, which is higher than previous days.\n      Using an average might smooth out the recent trend.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the last day (2017-01-08) as the forecast for the next day (2017-01-09), then use the average for the remaining 3 days? \n      But the problem says to forecast 96 hours (4 days). We could use the last day repeated? But that would ignore the weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data.\n\n 12. Given the very limited data, and that we are forecasting 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 13. However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 hours)/24\n        Day2: similarly\n        Day3, Day4.\n\n    We can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n            sum = 1.432+1.157+1.097+1.097+1.371+1.127+1.218+1.310+0.853+1.036+1.188+1.157+1.127+1.218+1.157+1.249+1.371+1.157+0.975+0.975+0.731+0.792+0.731+0.883\n            = 27.15 (approx)\n\n        Day2: \n            sum = 0.670+0.701+0.579+0.609+0.579+0.518+0.579+0.609+1.066+1.249+1.066+1.066+1.279+1.157+1.188+1.036+1.005+0.792+0.670+0.670+0.670+0.609+0.670+0.701\n            = 21.668\n\n        Day3:\n            sum = 0.640+0.609+0.548+0.548+0.518+0.640+0.670+0.731+0.944+1.279+1.249+1.279+0.640+0.731+1.066+0.944+1.097+1.097+0.731+0.914+0.822+0.731+0.731+0.914\n            = 21.184\n\n        Day4:\n            sum = 0.975+0.853+0.883+0.822+0.761+0.883+0.944+0.853+0.944+1.279+1.340+1.462+1.371+1.340+1.736+1.553+1.249+1.340+0.731+0.883+0.853+0.761+0.640+0.731\n            = 25.494\n\n        The daily averages: \n            Day1: 27.15/24 = 1.13125\n            Day2: 21.668/24 = 0.90283\n            Day3: 21.184/24 = 0.88267\n            Day4: 25.494/24 = 1.06225\n\n        There is no clear trend (it goes down then up). So averaging the same hour over the 4 days is acceptable.\n\n 14. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour00: (1.432 + 0.670 + 0.640 + 0.975) / 4 = 3.717/4 = 0.92925\n        hour01: (1.157 + 0.701 + 0.609 + 0.853) / 4 = 3.32/4 = 0.83\n        hour02: (1.097 + 0.579 + 0.548 + 0.883) / 4 = 3.107/4 = 0.77675\n        hour03: (1.097 + 0.609 + 0.548 + 0.822) / 4 = 3.076/4 = 0.769\n        hour04: (1.371 + 0.579 + 0.518 + 0.761) / 4 = 3.229/4 = 0.80725\n        hour05: (1.127 + 0.518 + 0.640 + 0.883) / 4 = 3.168/4 = 0.792\n        hour06: (1.218 + 0.579 + 0.670 + 0.944) / 4 = 3.411/4 = 0.85275\n        hour07: (1.310 + 0.609 + 0.731 + 0.853) / 4 = 3.503/4 = 0.87575\n        hour08: (0.853 + 1.066 + 0.944 + 0.944) / 4 = 3.807/4 = 0.95175\n        hour09: (1.036 + 1.249 + 1.279 + 1.279) / 4 = 4.843/4 = 1.21075\n        hour10: (1.188 + 1.066 + 1.249 + 1.340) / 4 = 4.843/4 = 1.21075   [Note: 1.188+1.066=2.254, +1.249=3.503, +1.340=4.843 -> 4.843/4=1.21075]\n        hour10: actually 1.188+1.066+1.249+1.340 = 4.843 -> 1.21075\n        hour11: (1.157 + 1.066 + 1.279 + 1.462) / 4 = 4.964/4 = 1.241\n        hour12: (1.127 + 1.279 + 0.640 + 1.371) / 4 = 4.417/4 = 1.10425\n        hour13: (1.218 + 1.157 + 0.731 + 1.340) / 4 = 4.446/4 = 1.1115\n        hour14: (1.157 + 1.188 + 1.066 + 1.736) / 4 = 5.147/4 = 1.28675\n        hour15: (1.249 + 1.036 + 0.944 + 1.553) / 4 = 4.782/4 = 1.1955\n        hour16: (1.371 + 1.005 + 1.097 + 1.249) / 4 = 4.722/4 = 1.1805\n        hour17: (1.157 + 0.792 + 1.097 + 1.340) / 4 = 4.386/4 = 1.0965\n        hour18: (0.975 + 0.670 + 0.731 + 0.731) / 4 = 3.107/4 = 0.77675\n        hour19: (0.975 + 0.670 + 0.914 + 0.883) / 4 = 3.442/4 = 0.8605\n        hour20: (0.731 + 0.670 + 0.822 + 0.853) / 4 = 3.076/4 = 0.769\n        hour21: (0.792 + 0.609 + 0.731 + 0.761) / 4 = 2.893/4 = 0.72325\n        hour22: (0.731 + 0.670 + 0.731 + 0.640) / 4 = 2.772/4 = 0.693\n        hour23: (0.883 + 0.701 + 0.914 + 0.731) / 4 = 3.229/4 = 0.80725\n\n 15. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-01-09 to 2017-01-12) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-09): \n            00:00:00 -> 0.92925\n            01:00:00 -> 0.83\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.80725\n\n        Day2 (2017-01-10): same 24 values\n        Day3 (2017-01-11): same 24 values\n        Day4 (2017-01-12): same 24 values\n\n 16. However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. \n     We are forecasting without any missing values in the history. For the forecast, we are generating all 96 points.\n\n 17. We must output the next 96 dates starting from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-01-08 23:00:00) and then every hour until 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n\n 18. Format: \n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00 <value>\n        2017-01-09 01:00:00 <value>\n        ...\n        2017-01-12 23:00:00 <value>\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n 19. We'll round the values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 20. Let's compute the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimal places):\n\n        hour00: 0.929\n        hour01: 0.830\n        hour02: 0.777\n        hour03: 0.769\n        hour04: 0.807\n        hour05: 0.792\n        hour06: 0.853\n        hour07: 0.876\n        hour08: 0.952\n        hour09: 1.211\n        hour10: 1.211   [Note: we computed 1.21075 -> 1.211]\n        hour11: 1.241\n        hour12: 1.104\n        hour13: 1.112\n        hour14: 1.287\n        hour15: 1.196\n        hour16: 1.181\n        hour17: 1.097\n        hour18: 0.777\n        hour19: 0.861\n        hour20: 0.769\n        hour21: 0.723\n        hour22: 0.693\n        hour23: 0.807\n\n 21. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-09 00:00:00 -> 0.929\n               2017-01-09 01:00:00 -> 0.830\n               ... until 2017-01-09 23:00:00 -> 0.807\n\n        Then 2017-01-10 00:00:00 -> 0.929\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day 5: 2017-01-09 (00:00 to 23:00)\n        Day 6: 2017-01-10\n        Day 7: 2017-01-11\n        Day 8: 2017-01-12\n\n 23. Code to generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime\n        start_date = datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(hours=i)\n\n 24. But we can do without code: \n\n        The first 24: 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-09 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-10 00:00:00 to 2017-01-10 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-11 00:00:00 to 2017-01-11 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-12 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00\n\n 25. We'll assign the 24 average values in order for each day.\n\n 26.
