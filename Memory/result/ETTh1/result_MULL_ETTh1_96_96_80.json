        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n We note that the data has missing values, but in the provided data there are no explicit missing entries (all 96 are present). However, we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the input. But the provided data does not have any missing entries? \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the given 96 points, there are no missing? \n    So we assume that the given 96 points are complete? Or should we check for missing timestamps? \n\n    Looking at the data: \n        The data starts at 2017-05-17 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-05-20 23:00:00, and there are 24 hours per day for 4 days: 4*24=96. \n        So the given data is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n 3. We note that the data has hourly frequency. We can use a time series model that can handle hourly data, but since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 96 points (4 days), \n    we must consider the seasonality. The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but 4 days is too short for weekly.\n\n 4. Given the small data size, we can use a simple model like:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the same value as the same hour in the previous day.\n    - But note: the last day we have is 2017-05-20 (Saturday). The next 4 days would be Sunday (2017-05-21), Monday (2017-05-22), Tuesday (2017-05-23), Wednesday (2017-05-24). \n      However, we don't have a full week of data to capture weekly patterns.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days of history.\n\n 5. Since the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the given data we don't have any, we can proceed without imputation for the history.\n\n 6. We decide to use a simple approach: \n    We will compute the average of the same hour for the past 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the next 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday) might have different patterns than the previous days (which are Wednesday to Saturday). \n    But without more data, we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-20) as the pattern for the next days? But that would be too simplistic.\n\n 7. Considering the trade-off, we choose to use the average of the same hour for the 4 available days.\n\n    Steps for forecasting:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days (from day 5 to day 8) will be:\n            forecast_hour_h = average of hour h from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n    But note: the first day in our history is 2017-05-17 (Wednesday) and the next 4 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n    Actually, 2017-05-17 is Wednesday, then 18: Thursday, 19: Friday, 20: Saturday. Then 21: Sunday, 22: Monday, 23: Tuesday, 24: Wednesday.\n\n    We don't have data for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in the history? We only have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n    Therefore, the same hour average might not be the best because of the weekly pattern. But we have no choice because we don't have multiple weeks.\n\n 8. We decide to use the average of the same hour for the 4 days we have. \n\n    Example: \n        For hour 00:00:00:\n            history: \n                2017-05-17 00:00:00: 0.107\n                2017-05-18 00:00:00: 0.711\n                2017-05-19 00:00:00: 0.959\n                2017-05-20 00:00:00: 0.355\n            average = (0.107 + 0.711 + 0.959 + 0.355) / 4 = 0.533\n\n        Then for each of the next 4 days at 00:00:00, we forecast 0.533.\n\n    But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We are generating 96 points.\n\n 9. However, we must note that the next 4 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. The history we used includes Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. \n    The Wednesday in the history is the same day of the week as the last day of the forecast (2017-05-24 is Wednesday). But the first three days of the forecast (Sun, Mon, Tue) are not in the history.\n\n    But without more data, we cannot do better.\n\n10. Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day? But we don't have a full week. We have only one week? Actually, we have 4 days: Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat.\n\n    We can try to use:\n        For Sunday: we don't have Sunday in history, so we use the average of the 4 days? \n        For Monday: same.\n        For Tuesday: same.\n        For Wednesday: we have one Wednesday in the history (2017-05-17) and also the average of the same hour for the 4 days.\n\n    But note: the average we computed is over 4 days that are consecutive and include one Wednesday, one Friday, etc.\n\n    We decide to use the same average for every day in the forecast.\n\n11. Implementation:\n\n    We will group the historical data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Then, for each of the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00), we take the hour of the day and assign the precomputed mean for that hour.\n\n12. Steps:\n\n    a) Extract the hour from the timestamp in the historical data.\n    b) Group by hour and compute the mean of MULL for each hour (0 to 23).\n    c) Generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00, then 2017-05-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n    d) For each timestamp, extract the hour and assign the mean value for that hour.\n\n13. However, note: the data might have negative values? Yes, we see negative in the history. So the mean might be negative? That's acceptable.\n\n14. Let's compute the mean for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the values.\n\n    Hour 0: [0.107, 0.711, 0.959, 0.355] -> mean = (0.107+0.711+0.959+0.355)/4 = 2.132/4 = 0.533\n    Hour 1: [0.249, 0.320, 0.213, 0.533] -> (0.249+0.320+0.213+0.533)=1.315/4=0.32875\n    Hour 2: [0.178, 0.462, 0.497, 0.569] -> (0.178+0.462+0.497+0.569)=1.706/4=0.4265\n    Hour 3: [1.102, 1.137, 0.142, 1.137] -> (1.102+1.137+0.142+1.137)=3.518/4=0.8795\n    Hour 4: [0.782, 0.569, 0.746, 0.853] -> (0.782+0.569+0.746+0.853)=2.95/4=0.7375\n    Hour 5: [1.635, 0.533, 0.888, 1.102] -> (1.635+0.533+0.888+1.102)=4.158/4=1.0395\n    Hour 6: [1.315, -0.036, 0.888, 0.995] -> (1.315-0.036+0.888+0.995)=3.162/4=0.7905\n    Hour 7: [1.102, 1.635, 1.102, 0.604] -> (1.102+1.635+1.102+0.604)=4.443/4=1.11075\n    Hour 8: [0.853, 1.421, 0.888, 0.604] -> (0.853+1.421+0.888+0.604)=3.766/4=0.9415\n    Hour 9: [0.142, 1.706, 0.355, 0.817] -> (0.142+1.706+0.355+0.817)=3.02/4=0.755\n    Hour 10: [1.990, 1.812, 1.102, 1.528] -> (1.990+1.812+1.102+1.528)=6.432/4=1.608\n    Hour 11: [2.025, 2.025, 0.853, 0.782] -> (2.025+2.025+0.853+0.782)=5.685/4=1.42125\n    Hour 12: [1.244, 2.132, 0.178, 0.426] -> (1.244+2.132+0.178+0.426)=3.98/4=0.995\n    Hour 13: [2.310, 2.772, 0.640, 0.569] -> (2.310+2.772+0.640+0.569)=6.291/4=1.57275\n    Hour 14: [1.208, 1.635, 0.746, 0.604] -> (1.208+1.635+0.746+0.604)=4.193/4=1.04825\n    Hour 15: [0.853, 1.492, 0.817, 0.355] -> (0.853+1.492+0.817+0.355)=3.517/4=0.87925\n    Hour 16: [0.746, 1.031, 0.213, 0.000] -> (0.746+1.031+0.213+0.000)=1.99/4=0.4975\n    Hour 17: [0.817, 0.959, 0.213, 0.711] -> (0.817+0.959+0.213+0.711)=2.7/4=0.675\n    Hour 18: [-0.036, 0.320, 0.142, 0.569] -> (-0.036+0.320+0.142+0.569)=0.995/4=0.24875\n    Hour 19: [0.107, 0.142, 0.071, 0.640] -> (0.107+0.142+0.071+0.640)=0.96/4=0.24\n    Hour 20: [0.000, 0.000, 0.036, 0.533] -> (0.000+0.000+0.036+0.533)=0.569/4=0.14225\n    Hour 21: [0.213, 0.071, 0.000, 0.391] -> (0.213+0.071+0.000+0.391)=0.675/4=0.16875\n    Hour 22: [0.959, 0.320, 0.888, 0.355] -> (0.959+0.320+0.888+0.355)=2.522/4=0.6305\n    Hour 23: [0.675, 0.853, 0.497, 0.320] -> (0.675+0.853+0.497+0.320)=2.345/4=0.58625\n\n15. Now, we generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n    Start: 2017-05-21 00:00:00 (which is hour0 of Sunday) -> use mean for hour0: 0.533\n    Then 2017-05-21 01:00:00 (hour1): 0.32875\n    ... until 2017-05-21 23:00:00 (hour23): 0.58625\n\n    Then 2017-05-22 00:00:00 (hour0): 0.533\n    ... and so on until 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n16. We output the data in the same format as the input, but for the next 96 hours.\n\n17. Format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\n2017-05-21 00:00:00  0.533\n2017-05-21 01:00:00  0.32875\n... (96 lines)\n2017-05-24 23:00:00  0.58625\n```\n\n    But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We see up to 3. We can round to 3 decimal places? \n    The problem does not specify, but to match the input, we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n    However, the input has values like 0.107, 0.249, ... and also negative. We'll round the forecast to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Example: 0.32875 -> 0.329 (if we round half up). But note: the original data did not round consistently? \n    We see 0.107, 0.249, 0.178, 1.102, etc. So we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n    We'll use: round(x, 3)\n\n    But note: 0.32875 rounded to 3 decimal places: \n        0.32875 -> look at the 4th decimal (7) which is >=5, so 0.329.\n\n    However, let's do it consistently.\n\n18. We'll create a list of the hourly means for hours 0 to 23 (rounded to 3 decimal places):\n\n    hour0: 0.533 -> 0.533\n    hour1: 0.32875 -> 0.329\n    hour2: 0.4265 -> 0.427\n    ... \n\n    But note: 0.4265 rounded to 3 decimals: 0.427? \n        The 4th digit is 5 -> round up: 0.427.\n\n    We'll do:\n\n        hour0: 0.533\n        hour1: round(0.32875,3) = 0.329\n        hour2: round(0.4265,3) = 0.427\n        hour3: round(0.8795,3) = 0.880\n        hour4: round(0.7375,3) = 0.738\n        hour5: round(1.0395,3) = 1.040\n        hour6: round(0.7905,3) = 0.791\n        hour7: round(1.11075,3) = 1.111\n        hour8: round(0.9415,3) = 0.942\n        hour9: round(0.755,3) = 0.755\n        hour10: round(1.608,3) = 1.608\n        hour11: round(1.42125,3) = 1.421\n        hour12: round(0.995,3) = 0.995\n        hour13: round(1.57275,3) = 1.573\n        hour14: round(1.04825,3) = 1.048\n        hour15: round(0.87925,3) = 0.879\n        hour16: round(0.4975,3) = 0.498\n        hour17: round(0.675,3) = 0.675\n        hour18: round(0.24875,3) = 0.249\n        hour19: round(0.24,3) = 0.240   # because 0.24 is 0.240\n        hour20: round(0.14225,3) = 0.142\n        hour21: round(0.16875,3) = 0.169\n        hour22: round(0.6305,3) = 0.631\n        hour23: round(0.58625,3) = 0.586\n\n19. Now, we the next 96 timestamps:\n\n    We start at 2017-05-21 00:00:00 (which is a Sunday) and go to 2017-05-24 23:00:00 (Wednesday).\n\n    We'll generate:\n\n        day1: 2017-05-21 (Sunday): hours 0 to 23 -> use the mean for hour0, hour1, ... hour23 as above.\n        day2: 2017-05-22 (Monday): same means (hour0 to hour23)\n        day3: 2017-05-23 (Tuesday): same means\n        day4: 2017-05-24 (Wednesday): same means\n\n20. We write the data in the required format.\n\n21. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n    We are providing 96 lines.\n\n22. Let's code the generation:\n\n    We'll create a list of the rounded means for each hour (index 0 to 23):\n\n        means = [0.533, 0.329, 0.427, 0.880, 0.738, 1.040, 0.791, 1.111, 0.942, 0.755, 1.608, 1.421, 0.995, 1.573, 1.048, 0.879, 0.498, 0.675, 0.249, 0.240, 0.142, 0.169, 0.631, 0.586]\n\n    Then for day_offset in range(0,4): # 4 days\n        for hour in range(0,24): # 24 hours\n            date = start_date + timedelta(days=day_offset, hours=hour)\n\n    Start date: 2017-05-21 00:00:00\n\n    We'll generate:\n\n        2017-05-21 00:00:00 -> means[0]\n        2017-05-21 01:00:00 -> means[1]\n        ...\n        2017-05-21 23:00:00 -> means[23]\n        2017-05-22 00:00:00 -> means[0]\n        ... until 2017-05-24 23:00:00 -> means[23]\n\n23. We output the data in the same format: two columns: date and MULL.\n\n24. We write the answer in the required format.\n\nLet's do it.\n",
