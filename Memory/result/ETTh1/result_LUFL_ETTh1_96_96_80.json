        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates is complete.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 3. We must account for potential seasonality and patterns. Given the hourly data, we might expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly patterns (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might be hard to capture).\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a time series model that handles multiple seasonality. However, with only 96 points (4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days ahead, we have limited data.\n - Given the short history, we might consider:\n     a) Using a simple model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24).\n     b) Using a model like SARIMA which can handle seasonality, but note that with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be well estimated.\n     c) Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but with only 96 points, it might overfit.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n Since the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates, we must generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n Considering the constraints, we choose to use a model that can handle seasonality and is robust for short series. \n We'll use the Exponential Smoothing model (ETS) with additive seasonality and a cycle of 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern. For example, we see peaks during the day and lower values at night.\n\n However, we also note that the data on 2017-05-19 and 2017-05-20 have some unusual spikes at midnight (00:00 to 04:00) with values above 4, which might be outliers or a different pattern. \n But without more context, we have to assume that these are part of the pattern.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   - Create a time series object with frequency=24 (for daily seasonality).\n   - Fit an ETS model (or alternatively, a seasonal naive model might be a baseline, but we want a better forecast).\n\n However, since we are an AI and cannot run code in the traditional sense, we must rely on a method that we can simulate.\n\n Alternative approach: \n   We can use a simple method: \n     - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n     - Extrapolate the trend (if any) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n But note: we only have 4 days, so the trend might be flat? Let's check the data:\n\n   The data from 2017-05-17 to 2017-05-20 doesn't show a clear upward or downward trend. It seems to be fluctuating around a level.\n\n   Therefore, we can assume the series is stationary and use the seasonal component.\n\n   We can compute the average daily pattern (by averaging the values at the same hour across the 4 days) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n   However, the data on the first two days (17th and 18th) and the next two (19th and 20th) show a different pattern at the beginning of the day (midnight to 4am). \n   Specifically, on the 19th and 20th, the first 4 hours are much higher (around 4.2 to 4.6) compared to the 17th and 18th (around 1.7 to 2.2). \n\n   This might indicate that the pattern on weekends is different? But note: \n        17th: Wednesday, 18th: Thursday, 19th: Friday, 20th: Saturday.\n\n   So the 20th is Saturday. The 21st (the first day we forecast) is Sunday, then 22nd Monday, 23rd Tuesday, 24th Wednesday.\n\n   We don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only one Saturday and one Sunday missing). \n\n   Therefore, we might have to rely on the daily pattern and hope that the pattern for the same hour is similar.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify the day of the week, so we cannot explicitly model weekly seasonality with only 4 days.\n\n   We decide to use the average of the last two days (19th and 20th) for the weekend pattern and the first two days (17th and 18th) for the weekday? \n   However, we are forecasting 4 days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. \n\n   We don't have Sunday data in the history. So we have to use the daily average of all 4 days for each hour? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the entire 4 days to compute the hourly average and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly average:\n\n        hour0: (2.224 + 1.858 + 4.599 + 4.234) / 4 = (2.224+1.858+4.599+4.234)/4 = 12.915/4 = 3.22875\n        hour1: (2.071+1.797+4.386+4.234)/4 = (2.071+1.797+4.386+4.234)=12.488/4=3.122\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days would be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   However, this would ignore any trend and also the fact that the pattern on weekdays and weekends might be different.\n\n   But with only 4 days, we have two weekdays (Wed, Thu) and two weekend days (Fri, Sat) and we are forecasting a Sunday and then weekdays.\n\n   We might do:\n\n        For Sunday (21st): we don't have a Sunday in history, so we use the average of the two weekend days we have (Fri and Sat) for the same hour? \n        But note: Friday (19th) and Saturday (20th) are not exactly the same as Sunday? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the entire 4-day average for each hour for the entire forecast period.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we choose the simple method: use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form a 24-hour profile, and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Step 2: For the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the mean value for hour0 of day1 (which is 2017-05-21 00:00:00) as the mean of hour0, then hour1, ... up to hour23 for the first day, then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2017-05-19 and 2017-05-20 have very high values at the first 4 hours. Since the next day (2017-05-21) is a Sunday, and the previous Sunday is not in the data, we are not sure. \n   But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [2.224, 1.858, 4.599, 4.234] -> mean = (2.224+1.858+4.599+4.234)/4 = 3.22875\n        hour1: [2.071, 1.797, 4.386, 4.234] -> (2.071+1.797+4.386+4.234)/4 = 3.122\n        hour2: [2.163, 1.736, 4.386, 4.234] -> (2.163+1.736+4.386+4.234)/4 = 3.12975\n        hour3: [1.858, 1.736, 4.630, 4.112] -> (1.858+1.736+4.630+4.112)/4 = 3.084\n        hour4: [1.828, 1.949, 4.477, 1.797] -> (1.828+1.949+4.477+1.797)/4 = 2.51275\n        hour5: [2.863, 2.619, 2.376, 2.284] -> (2.863+2.619+2.376+2.284)/4 = 2.5355\n        hour6: [3.076, 3.655, 2.955, 3.107] -> (3.076+3.655+2.955+3.107)/4 = 3.19825\n        hour7: [3.168, 3.015, 2.894, 2.955] -> (3.168+3.015+2.894+2.955)/4 = 3.008\n        hour8: [3.107, 3.137, 2.955, 3.107] -> (3.107+3.137+2.955+3.107)/4 = 3.0765\n        hour9: [2.955, 2.711, 3.015, 3.350] -> (2.955+2.711+3.015+3.350)/4 = 3.00775\n        hour10: [2.924, 2.924, 3.046, 3.442] -> (2.924+2.924+3.046+3.442)/4 = 3.084\n        hour11: [3.137, 3.229, 3.716, 3.168] -> (3.137+3.229+3.716+3.168)/4 = 3.3125\n        hour12: [2.376, 2.559, 2.376, 2.650] -> (2.376+2.559+2.376+2.650)/4 = 2.49025\n        hour13: [2.315, 2.498, 2.711, 2.741] -> (2.315+2.498+2.711+2.741)/4 = 2.56625\n        hour14: [2.498, 2.650, 2.650, 2.437] -> (2.498+2.650+2.650+2.437)/4 = 2.55875\n        hour15: [2.467, 2.619, 2.437, 2.650] -> (2.467+2.619+2.437+2.650)/4 = 2.54325\n        hour16: [2.345, 2.254, 2.437, 2.985] -> (2.345+2.254+2.437+2.985)/4 = 2.50525\n        hour17: [2.802, 2.559, 2.650, 2.833] -> (2.802+2.559+2.650+2.833)/4 = 2.711\n        hour18: [2.772, 3.076, 2.650, 2.985] -> (2.772+3.076+2.650+2.985)/4 = 2.87075\n        hour19: [2.437, 2.772, 2.376, 2.680] -> (2.437+2.772+2.376+2.680)/4 = 2.56625\n        hour20: [2.863, 3.015, 2.802, 2.924] -> (2.863+3.015+2.802+2.924)/4 = 2.901\n        hour21: [2.589, 2.498, 2.559, 2.345] -> (2.589+2.498+2.559+2.345)/4 = 2.49775\n        hour22: [2.224, 2.467, 2.498, 2.254] -> (2.224+2.467+2.498+2.254)/4 = 2.36075\n        hour23: [2.102, 2.589, 2.193, 2.071] -> (2.102+2.589+2.193+2.071)/4 = 2.23875\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-05-21): \n            00:00:00 -> 3.22875\n            01:00:00 -> 3.122\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 2.23875\n\n        Day2 (2017-05-22): same 24 numbers repeated.\n        Day3 (2017-05-23): same.\n        Day4 (2017-05-24): same.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data.
