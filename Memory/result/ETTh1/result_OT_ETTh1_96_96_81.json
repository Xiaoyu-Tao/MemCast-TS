        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00) of oil temperature (OT) for a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00).\n Note: The data has missing values? But in the provided data, we have 96 consecutive records without any missing time stamps? \n However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete? \n We must be cautious: the problem might imply that the entire dataset (including the future) could have missing values? \n But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must produce 96 consecutive records without missing any.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, we must generate 96 consecutive timestamps and their corresponding OT values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note the data is hourly. The last given point is at 2017-05-24 23:00:00. The next 96 points will be from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00 (because 96 hours = 4 days).\n\n 2. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the provided data? But the provided 96 points are complete. \n    However, the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning we might need to impute? But the provided data for the past 96 is complete.\n\n 3. We are to use time series forecasting. Given the data, we can use a model that can handle hourly data with daily seasonality.\n\n 4. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern: temperatures are lower at night and higher during the day.\n    - There are some anomalies (like on 2017-05-22 19:00:00, the temperature drops to 14.351, which is lower than the surrounding points).\n\n 5. We are to forecast the next 96 hours. We can use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet. However, since we are in a text-based environment and without the ability to run code, we must rely on a simple method.\n\n 6. But note: the problem says we are an expert. We must provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can use a naive method: \n    - We can use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But note: the data only covers 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days: 21,22,23,24 of May 2017.\n\n 8. However, the data has an anomaly on the 22nd. So we might want to use a median to avoid the effect of outliers? Or we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend.\n\n 9. Since we cannot run code, we have to think of a formulaic approach.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour. But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check:\n\n      Day 21: starts at 19.627 at 00:00, then goes down and then up to 23.707 at 16:00 and then down.\n      Day 22: starts at 18.009 at 00:00, then goes up to 25.395 at 16:00, but then a big drop at 19:00 to 14.351.\n      Day 23: starts at 18.29, then goes up to 19.627 at 04:00, then drops to 10.919? and then recovers? This day seems very different.\n      Day 24: starts at 12.592, then goes up to 20.471 at 15:00, then down.\n\n 11. The data is not stable. We might need to use a model that can handle multiple seasonality? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and without being able to run a model, we can do:\n\n     We'll use the median of the same hour for the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But note: the pattern might be changing.\n\n 13. However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We have to generate 96 points.\n\n 14. We can also consider: the data has a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly.\n\n 15. Another idea: use the last available day (May 24) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 16. But note: the problem says we are an expert. We must provide a reasonable answer.\n\n 17. We are going to use a simple method: \n     For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the median of that hour from the 4 available days (if available) and use that for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n     However, we have 4 days, so for each hour we have 4 values. We can take the median to avoid the effect of the anomaly.\n\n     Steps:\n        For hour 0: we have [19.627001, 18.009001, 18.290001, 12.592000] -> sort: [12.592, 18.009, 18.29, 19.627] -> median = (18.009+18.29)/2 = 18.1495\n        For hour 1: [19.344999, 17.587, 18.219999, 13.366] -> sort: [13.366, 17.587, 18.22, 19.345] -> median = (17.587+18.22)/2 = 17.9035\n\n     But note: the data for the 24th is lower? So the forecast for the next day (25th) might be lower? \n\n     However, we are going to use the same median for each day in the forecast? That is, the same pattern for each of the next 4 days? \n\n 18. But the problem says we must forecast 96 points (4 days). So we can generate:\n\n     Day 25: 00:00:00 -> median of 00:00 from the 4 days\n             01:00:00 -> median of 01:00 from the 4 days\n             ... and so on.\n\n     Day 26: same as Day 25? But that would be the same pattern? \n\n     However, we don't have a trend? The data doesn't show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days? \n\n     Let's check the average of each day:\n\n        Day 21: average = (sum of 24 hours)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n            from 15.476 to 23.707 -> average around 19-20?\n        Day 22: has a big drop at 19:00 -> average might be lower? \n        Day 23: has very low values in the morning? \n        Day 24: starts low but recovers.\n\n     Without a clear trend, we can assume the pattern is stable? \n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the median for each hour and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. We must generate 96 points. We'll create 4 days of 24 hours each.\n\n 21. How to handle the fact that the median might be based on 4 points? We have 4 days, so for each hour we have 4 points.\n\n 22. We'll compute the median for each hour (0 to 23) and then use that as the forecast for that hour for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 23. Steps for each hour H (0 to 23):\n        values = [ value at H:00 on 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th ]\n        median = median of these 4\n\n 24. Then for the next 4 days (25th, 26th, 27th, 28th) at hour H, we use that median.\n\n 25. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not told which ones are missing in the provided data? \n     Actually, the provided 96 points are complete? So we have 4 full days.\n\n 26. We'll compute the medians for each hour.\n\n 27. Let's do the calculation for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00): [19.627001, 18.009001, 18.290001, 12.592000] -> sorted: [12.592, 18.009, 18.29, 19.627] -> median = (18.009+18.29)/2 = 18.1495\n     Hour 1 (01:00): [19.344999, 17.587, 18.219999, 13.366] -> sorted: [13.366, 17.587, 18.22, 19.345] -> median = (17.587+18.22)/2 = 17.9035\n     Hour 2 (02:00): [19.416, 17.305, 18.853001, 13.577] -> sorted: [13.577, 17.305, 18.853, 19.416] -> median = (17.305+18.853)/2 = 18.079\n     Hour 3 (03:00): [17.938, 16.601999, 19.627001, 13.718] -> sorted: [13.718, 16.602, 17.938, 19.627] -> median = (16.602+17.938)/2 = 17.27\n     Hour 4 (04:00): [16.672001, 15.969, 19.344999, 13.507] -> sorted: [13.507, 15.969, 16.672, 19.345] -> median = (15.969+16.672)/2 = 16.3205\n     Hour 5 (05:00): [16.882999, 16.25, 18.219999, 12.029] -> sorted: [12.029, 16.25, 16.883, 18.22] -> median = (16.25+16.883)/2 = 16.5665\n     Hour 6 (06:00): [15.476, 15.617, 14.351, 13.366] -> sorted: [13.366, 14.351, 15.476, 15.617] -> median = (14.351+15.476)/2 = 14.9135\n     Hour 7 (07:00): [16.672001, 15.898, 15.828, 14.28] -> sorted: [14.28, 15.828, 15.898, 16.672] -> median = (15.828+15.898)/2 = 15.863\n     Hour 8 (08:00): [17.868, 16.813, 11.959, 14.351] -> sorted: [11.959, 14.351, 16.813, 17.868] -> median = (14.351+16.813)/2 = 15.582\n     Hour 9 (09:00): [17.726999, 17.305, 10.974, 14.914] -> sorted: [10.974, 14.914, 17.305, 17.727] -> median = (14.914+17.305)/2 = 16.1095\n     Hour 10 (10:00): [18.500999, 18.079, 10.341, 15.054] -> sorted: [10.341, 15.054, 18.079, 18.501] -> median = (15.054+18.079)/2 = 16.5665\n     Hour 11 (11:00): [19.416, 18.993999, 10.271, 16.25] -> sorted: [10.271, 16.25, 18.994, 19.416] -> median = (16.25+18.994)/2 = 17.622\n     Hour 12 (12:00): [20.190001, 19.416, 14.351, 17.165001] -> sorted: [14.351, 17.165, 19.416, 20.19] -> median = (17.165+19.416)/2 = 18.2905\n     Hour 13 (13:00): [21.315001, 21.808001, 12.944, 17.165001] -> sorted: [12.944, 17.165, 21.315, 21.808] -> median = (17.165+21.315)/2 = 19.24\n     Hour 14 (14:00): [22.441, 23.988001, 10.482, 18.923] -> sorted: [10.482, 18.923, 22.441, 23.988] -> median = (18.923+22.441)/2 = 20.682\n     Hour 15 (15:00): [23.496, 24.903, 11.467, 20.471001] -> sorted: [11.467, 20.471, 23.496, 24.903] -> median = (20.471+23.496)/2 = 21.9835\n     Hour 16 (16:00): [23.707001, 25.395, 9.919, 19.275] -> sorted: [9.919, 19.275, 23.707, 25.395] -> median = (19.275+23.707)/2 = 21.491\n     Hour 17 (17:00): [22.441, 24.481001, 13.155, 17.726999] -> sorted: [13.155, 17.727, 22.441, 24.481] -> median = (17.727+22.441)/2 = 20.084\n     Hour 18 (18:00): [22.159, 24.27, 14.632, 18.361] -> sorted: [14.632, 18.361, 22.159, 24.27] -> median = (18.361+22.159)/2 = 20.26\n     Hour 19 (19:00): [21.667, 14.351, 14.491, 17.657] -> sorted: [14.351, 14.491, 17.657, 21.667] -> median = (14.491+17.657)/2 = 16.074\n     Hour 20 (20:00): [20.752001, 16.320999, 13.788, 17.094] -> sorted: [13.788, 16.321, 17.094, 20.752] -> median = (16.321+17.094)/2 = 16.7075\n     Hour 21 (21:00): [19.768, 18.290001, 14.351, 16.743] -> sorted: [14.351, 16.743, 18.29, 19.768] -> median = (16.743+18.29)/2 = 17.5165\n     Hour 22 (22:00): [19.275, 19.416, 13.225, 16.813] -> sorted: [13.225, 16.813, 19.275, 19.416] -> median = (16.813+19.275)/2 = 18.044\n     Hour 23 (23:00): [18.712, 18.572001, 12.381, 16.108999] -> sorted: [12.381, 16.109, 18.572, 18.712] -> median = (16.109+18.572)/2 = 17.3405\n\n 28. Now, we will create the next 4 days (2017-05-25 to 2017-05-28) by repeating these 24 medians for each day.\n\n 29. The dates will be generated as:\n\n      2017-05-25 00:00:00 -> 18.1495\n      2017-05-25 01:00:00 -> 17.9035\n      ... until 2017-05-25 23:00:00 -> 17.3405\n\n      Then 2017-05-26 00:00:00 -> 18.1495\n      and so on.\n\n 30. We must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and OT) for 96 rows.\n\n 31. We'll round the OT to 3 decimal places? The original data had up to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. However, note: the original data had some with 3 and some with 6? Actually, the example shows 19.627001 -> 6 decimal places? \n     But we can output with 3 decimal places? Or 6? Let's output with 6 to be safe? But the problem says \"complete data\", so we should match the format.\n\n 33. The original data had:\n\n          2017-05-21 00:00:00 19.627001\n\n     So we'll output the float with 6 decimal places? But our medians are computed with 3 or 4 decimal places? \n\n     We can output as float with 6 decimal places by formatting.\n\n 34. We'll generate:\n\n        date                OT\n        2017-05-25 00:00:00 18.149500\n        2017-05-25 01:00:00 17.903500\n        ... \n\n 35. But note: the medians we computed are in some cases exact (like 18.1495) and we can represent with 6 decimals by adding zeros? \n     Actually, we can output with 6 decimal places by formatting the number to 6 decimals.\n\n 36. However, the problem says \"complete data\", so we must output 96 points.\n\n 37. We'll generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24 medians for 4 days.\n\n 38. Let's write the data.\n\n 39. We must be cautious: the dates must be consecutive and hourly.\n\n 40. The last date in the input is 2017-05-24 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-05-25 00:00:00.\n\n 41. We'll generate 4 days: 2017-05-25, 2017-05-26, 2017-05-27, 2017-05-28.\n\n 42. We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        from datetime: 2017-05-25 00:00:00, then 2017-05-25 01:00:00 ... until 2017-05-28 23:00:00.\n\n 43. We'll create a list of OT values by repeating the 24 medians (for hours 0 to 23) for 4 times.\n\n 44. We must output in the exact format.\n\n 45. We'll write the answer in the required XML-like tag.\n\n 46. Code for generating the dates in Python (for our reference, but we are not running code, so we do it manually?):\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 5, 25, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 47. But we are to write the data as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-25 00:00:00 18.149500\n2017-05-25 01:00:00 17.903500\n...\n2017-05-28 23:00:00 17.340500\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 48. We have to write 96 lines.\n\n 49. We'll list the medians for each hour (0 to 23) and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 50. The medians we computed (rounded to 6 decimal places):\n\n        hour0: 18.149500\n        hour1: 17.903500\n        hour2: 18.079000\n        hour3: 17.270000\n        hour4: 16.320500\n        hour5: 16.566500\n        hour6: 14.913500\n        hour7: 15.863000\n        hour8: 15.582000\n        hour9: 16.109500\n        hour10: 16.566500\n        hour11: 17.622000\n        hour12: 18.290500\n        hour13: 19.240000\n        hour14: 20.682000\n        hour15: 21.983500\n        hour16: 21.491000\n        hour17: 20.084000\n        hour18: 20.260000\n        hour19: 16.074000\n        hour20: 16.707500\n        hour21: 17.516500\n        hour22: 18.044000\n        hour23: 17.340500\n\n 51.

However, note: the problem says the data has missing values?
