        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00) for the variable \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour cycle). This is evident from the pattern that repeats every 24 hours.\n 2. We also note that there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are 96 consecutive points (4 days * 24 hours = 96) so no missing values in the input.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality, we can use a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model or exponential smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, since we are only given 96 points, we need a model that can work with limited data.\n\n Given the constraints, we choose to use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline because:\n   - It is simple and often works well for seasonal data.\n   - The data has a strong daily pattern (seasonal period of 24).\n\n The Seasonal Naive method uses the value from the same time in the previous season (i.e., same hour of the previous day) as the forecast.\n\n However, note that we have exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can use the last 3 days to forecast the next day? But the problem says to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). \n\n Since we have 4 days of data, we can use the entire 4 days to forecast the next 4 days by taking the seasonal naive from the same hour of the previous cycle. But note: we have only one cycle? Actually, we have 4 cycles (each day is a cycle). However, to forecast the next 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? Or we can use the last day (the 4th day) as the forecast for the next day? But we need 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available days. However, the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would give the same value for each day. We want to capture the daily pattern.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and the data shows a pattern that is not exactly the same every day, but similar.\n\n Approach:\n   We will compute the average for each hour of the 4 days we have, and then use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n   For example:\n     For hour 00:00:00, we have 4 values: \n        2017-07-04 00:00:00: -0.792\n        2017-07-05 00:00:00: -0.914\n        2017-07-06 00:00:00: -0.792\n        2017-07-07 00:00:00: -0.609\n     The average for 00:00:00 is: (-0.792 -0.914 -0.792 -0.609) / 4 = -0.77675\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast period (2017-07-08 to 2017-07-11) at 00:00:00, we use -0.77675.\n\n   Similarly for 01:00:00, etc.\n\n   This method will produce a forecast that is the same for each day (i.e., the daily pattern is repeated without change).\n\n 4. Generate the next 96 hours of dates: starting from 2017-07-08 00:00:00, then every hour until 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n 5. We must output the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same format.\n\n However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data? But in the provided data there are none. And we are forecasting without gaps? We are to provide the next 96 consecutive hours.\n\n But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". However, in the provided 96 points there are no missing values. So we proceed.\n\n Let's compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n   Step:\n     Group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and compute the mean.\n\n   We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n   We'll create a list of 24 values (each being the average for that hour).\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we will repeat these 24 values 4 times.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a DataFrame from the given data (if we were in code) but since we are not, we do it manually.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a small table.\n\n   Let me compute the averages:\n\n   Hour 0: (2017-07-04 00:00:00: -0.792, 2017-07-05 00:00:00: -0.914, 2017-07-06 00:00:00: -0.792, 2017-07-07 00:00:00: -0.609) -> (-0.792 -0.914 -0.792 -0.609)/4 = -3.107/4 = -0.77675\n   Hour 1: (-0.883, -0.914, -0.853, -0.670) -> (-0.883 -0.914 -0.853 -0.670) = -3.32 -> -0.83\n   Hour 2: (-0.822, -0.853, -0.883, -0.548) -> (-0.822 -0.853 -0.883 -0.548) = -3.106 -> -0.7765\n   Hour 3: (-0.944, -0.853, -0.944, -0.609) -> (-0.944 -0.853 -0.944 -0.609) = -3.35 -> -0.8375\n   Hour 4: (-0.883, -0.883, -0.944, -0.487) -> (-0.883 -0.883 -0.944 -0.487) = -3.197 -> -0.79925\n   Hour 5: (-0.914, -0.670, -0.579, -0.670) -> (-0.914 -0.670 -0.579 -0.670) = -2.833 -> -0.70825\n   Hour 6: (-0.670, -0.640, -0.579, -0.548) -> (-0.670 -0.640 -0.579 -0.548) = -2.437 -> -0.60925\n   Hour 7: (-0.670, -0.579, -0.548, -0.457) -> (-0.670 -0.579 -0.548 -0.457) = -2.254 -> -0.5635\n   Hour 8: (-0.579, -0.305, -0.640, 0.305) -> (-0.579 -0.305 -0.640 +0.305) = -1.219 -> -0.30475\n   Hour 9: (-0.487, -0.457, -0.701, -0.396) -> (-0.487 -0.457 -0.701 -0.396) = -2.041 -> -0.51025\n   Hour 10: (-0.335, -0.457, -0.670, -0.305) -> (-0.335 -0.457 -0.670 -0.305) = -1.767 -> -0.44175\n   Hour 11: (-0.579, -0.609, -0.792, -0.305) -> (-0.579 -0.609 -0.792 -0.305) = -2.285 -> -0.57125\n   Hour 12: (-0.487, -0.518, -0.670, -0.426) -> (-0.487 -0.518 -0.670 -0.426) = -2.101 -> -0.52525\n   Hour 13: (-0.609, -0.548, -0.640, -0.335) -> (-0.609 -0.548 -0.640 -0.335) = -2.132 -> -0.533\n   Hour 14: (-0.518, -0.579, -0.609, -0.396) -> (-0.518 -0.579 -0.609 -0.396) = -2.102 -> -0.5255\n   Hour 15: (-0.518, -0.670, -0.548, -0.457) -> (-0.518 -0.670 -0.548 -0.457) = -2.193 -> -0.54825\n   Hour 16: (-0.640, -0.426, -0.701, -0.305) -> (-0.640 -0.426 -0.701 -0.305) = -2.072 -> -0.518\n   Hour 17: (-0.548, -0.548, -0.853, -0.396) -> (-0.548 -0.548 -0.853 -0.396) = -2.345 -> -0.58625\n   Hour 18: (-0.792, -0.731, -0.883, -0.640) -> (-0.792 -0.731 -0.883 -0.640) = -3.046 -> -0.7615\n   Hour 19: (-0.883, -0.914, -0.731, -0.670) -> (-0.883 -0.914 -0.731 -0.670) = -3.198 -> -0.7995\n   Hour 20: (-0.670, -1.036, -0.701, -0.396) -> (-0.670 -1.036 -0.701 -0.396) = -2.803 -> -0.70075\n   Hour 21: (-0.670, -0.792, -0.640, -0.396) -> (-0.670 -0.792 -0.640 -0.396) = -2.498 -> -0.6245\n   Hour 22: (-0.670, -0.731, -0.640, -0.579) -> (-0.670 -0.731 -0.640 -0.579) = -2.62 -> -0.655\n   Hour 23: (-0.792, -0.975, -0.609, -0.640) -> (-0.792 -0.975 -0.609 -0.640) = -3.016 -> -0.754\n\n   Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (starting from 2017-07-08 00:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-07-08): \n            00:00:00 -> -0.77675\n            01:00:00 -> -0.83\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> -0.754\n\n        Day 2 (2017-07-09): same as above\n        Day 3 (2017-07-10): same as above\n        Day 4 (2017-07-11): same as above\n\n 6. Format the output: We must output 96 lines, each with the date and the forecasted value.\n\n   The dates are generated as:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-08 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        start = '2017-07-08 00:00:00'\n        end = '2017-07-11 23:00:00'\n        date_range = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq='H')\n\n   But we are not in code, so we write:\n\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-07-08 23:00:00\n        2017-07-09 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-07-11 23:00:00\n\n   And then assign the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 7. We must output the data in the same format as the input, with two columns: \"date\" and \"LULL\", and the values rounded to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me recalculate the averages and round:\n\n   Hour 0: -0.77675 -> -0.777\n   Hour 1: -0.83 -> -0.830 (but let's compute exactly: -0.883-0.914-0.853-0.670 = -3.32 -> -0.830)\n   ... \n\n   Actually, we should round to 3 decimal places. We'll do:\n\n        hour0 = round((-0.792 -0.914 -0.792 -0.609)/4, 3) = round(-0.77675, 3) = -0.777\n\n   But note: the input has values with 3 decimal places, so we should output 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me compute each hour again and round:\n\n   Hour 0: (-0.792 -0.914 -0.792 -0.609) = -3.107 -> -3.107/4 = -0.77675 -> round to 3 decimals: -0.777\n   Hour 1: (-0.883 -0.914 -0.853 -0.670) = -3.32 -> -3.32/4 = -0.83 -> -0.830\n   Hour 2: (-0.822 -0.853 -0.883 -0.548) = -3.106 -> -3.106/4 = -0.7765 -> -0.776\n   Hour 3: (-0.944 -0.853 -0.944 -0.609) = -3.35 -> -3.35/4 = -0.8375 -> -0.838\n   Hour 4: (-0.883 -0.883 -0.944 -0.487) = -3.197 -> -3.197/4 = -0.79925 -> -0.799\n   Hour 5: (-0.914 -0.670 -0.579 -0.670) = -2.833 -> -2.833/4 = -0.70825 -> -0.708\n   Hour 6: (-0.670 -0.640 -0.579 -0.548) = -2.437 -> -2.437/4 = -0.60925 -> -0.609\n   Hour 7: (-0.670 -0.579 -0.548 -0.457) = -2.254 -> -2.254/4 = -0.5635 -> -0.564\n   But wait: -2.254/4 = -0.5635 -> rounding to 3 decimals: -0.564 (since 5 rounds up)\n   Hour 8: (-0.579 -0.305 -0.640 +0.305) = -1.579 + 0.305? Actually: \n        -0.579 -0.305 = -0.884; -0.884 -0.640 = -1.524; -1.524 +0.305 = -1.219 -> -1.219/4 = -0.30475 -> -0.305\n   Hour 9: (-0.487 -0.457 -0.701 -0.396) = -2.041 -> -2.041/4 = -0.51025 -> -0.510\n   Hour 10: (-0.335 -0.457 -0.670 -0.305) = -1.767 -> -1.767/4 = -0.44175 -> -0.442\n   Hour 11: (-0.579 -0.609 -0.792 -0.305) = -2.285 -> -2.285/4 = -0.57125 -> -0.571\n   Hour 12: (-0.487 -0.518 -0.670 -0.426) = -2.101 -> -2.101/4 = -0.52525 -> -0.525\n   Hour 13: (-0.609 -0.548 -0.640 -0.335) = -2.132 -> -2.132/4 = -0.533 -> -0.533\n   Hour 14: (-0.518 -0.579 -0.609 -0.396) = -2.102 -> -2.102/4 = -0.5255 -> -0.526 (because 0.5255 rounded to 3 decimals: 0.526? \n        But note: 0.5255 is exactly halfway? However, the rule is to round to the nearest even? \n        Actually, 0.5255 * 1000 = 525.5 -> round to integer: 526 -> so 0.526. But negative: -0.5255 -> -0.526? \n        However, in the input we see negative numbers and they are rounded to 3 decimals. Let me check: \n        The input has -0.792, which is rounded to 3 decimals. \n        We'll do: \n            -0.5255: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal from 5 to 6? \n            But note: the number is negative, rounding for negative numbers: \n            The rule is to round away from zero? Or to the nearest even? \n            In most systems, it's \"round half away from zero\", so -0.5255 becomes -0.526.\n\n        So: -0.5255 -> -0.526\n   Hour 15: (-0.518 -0.670 -0.548 -0.457) = -2.193 -> -2.193/4 = -0.54825 -> -0.548 (because 0.54825 rounded to 3 decimals: the fourth decimal is 2, so we don't round up -> -0.548)\n        Actually: -0.54825 -> the fourth decimal is 2, so we leave as -0.548.\n   Hour 16: (-0.640 -0.426 -0.701 -0.305) = -2.072 -> -2.072/4 = -0.518 -> -0.518\n   Hour 17: (-0.548 -0.548 -0.853 -0.396) = -2.345 -> -2.345/4 = -0.58625 -> -0.586\n   Hour 18: (-0.792 -0.731 -0.883 -0.640) = -3.046 -> -3.046/4 = -0.7615 -> -0.762 (because 0.7615 -> round to even? 0.762)\n   Hour 19: (-0.883 -0.914 -0.731 -0.670) = -3.198 -> -3.198/4 = -0.7995 -> -0.800 (because 0.7995 -> 0.800)\n   Hour 20: (-0.670 -1.036 -0.701 -0.396) = -2.803 -> -2.803/4 = -0.70075 -> -0.701\n   Because: 0.70075 -> the fourth decimal is 7, so we round up the third decimal: 0.701 -> but wait, the third decimal is 0 and we are rounding the 0 to 1? \n        Actually: 0.70075: \n            The digit in the thousandths place is 0, the next digit is 7 which is >=5, so we round up the thousandths place: 0.701.\n        So -0.70075 -> -0.701.\n   Hour 21: (-0.670 -0.792 -0.640 -0.396) = -2.498 -> -2.498/4 = -0.6245 -> -0.624 (because 0.6245: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the thousandths place? \n        But note: 0.6245: the thousandths place is 4, and the next is 5 -> round up: 0.625? \n        Actually: 0.6245: \n            The digit in the thousandths place is 4, the next is 5 -> we round up the 4 to 5 -> 0.625.\n        So -0.6245 -> -0.625.\n   Hour 22: (-0.670 -0.731 -0.640 -0.579) = -2.62 -> -2.62/4 = -0.655 -> -0.655 (exactly)\n   Hour 23: (-0.792 -0.975 -0.609 -0.640) = -3.016 -> -3.016/4 = -0.754 -> -0.754\n\n   But wait, for hour 21: \n        -2.498 / 4 = -0.6245 -> rounding: \n            The number is -0.6245. \n            We look at the fourth decimal: 5, and the third decimal is 4 -> we round up the 4 to 5 -> becomes -0.625.\n\n   However, let me double-check the calculation for hour 21: \n        Values: -0.670, -0.792, -0.640, -0.396\n        Sum = -0.670 -0.792 = -1.462; -1.462 -0.640 = -2.102; -2.102 -0.396 = -2.498 -> correct.\n        -2.498 / 4 = -0.6245 -> correct.\n\n   So we have:\n\n        hour0: -0.777\n        hour1: -0.830\n        hour2: -0.776\n        hour3: -0.838\n        hour4: -0.799\n        hour5: -0.708\n        hour6: -0.609\n        hour7: -0.564\n        hour8: -0.305\n        hour9: -0.510\n        hour10: -0.442\n        hour11: -0.571\n        hour12: -0.525\n        hour13: -0.533\n        hour14: -0.526\n        hour15: -0.548\n        hour16: -0.518\n        hour17: -0.586\n        hour18: -0.762\n        hour19: -0.800\n        hour20: -0.701\n        hour21: -0.625\n        hour22: -0.655\n        hour23: -0.754\n\n 8.

We write the data in the required format.\n\n Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-08 00:00:00 -0.777\n2017-07-08 01:00:00 -0.830\n2017-07-08 02:00:00 -0.776\n2017-07-08 03:00:00 -0.838\n2017-07-08 04:00:00 -0.799\n2017-07-08 05:00:00 -0.708\n2017-07-08 06:00:00 -0.609\n2017-07-08 07:00:00 -0.564\n2017-07-08 08:00:00 -0.305\n2017-07-08 09:00:00 -0.510\n2017-07-08 10:00:00 -0.442\n2017-07-08 11:00:00 -0.571\n2017-07-08 12:00:00 -0.525\n2017-07-08 13:00:00 -0.533\n2017-07-08 14:00:00 -0.526\n2017-07-08 15:00:00 -0.548\n2017-07-08 16:00:00 -0.518\n2017-07-08 17:00:00 -0.586\n2017-07-08 18:00:00 -0.762\n2017-07-08 19:00:00 -0.800\n2017-07-08 20:00:00 -0.701\n2017-07-08 21:00:00 -0.625\n2017-07-08 22:00:00 -0.655\n2017-07-08 23:00:00 -0.754\n2017-07-09 00:00:00 -0.777\n2017-07-09 01:00:00 -0.830\n...
