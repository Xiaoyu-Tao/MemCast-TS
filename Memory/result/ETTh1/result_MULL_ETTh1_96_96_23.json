        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The data has missing values note, but in the provided data we don't see any missing values. However, we must be cautious.\n\n Since the problem requires forecasting the next 96 time points (i.e., the next 4 days) and the data is hourly, we note the frequency.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We'll use a time series model that can handle potential seasonality. Given the data is hourly and we see a pattern over days, \n    we might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not feasible.\n\n 2. We note that the data has fluctuations and possible multiple seasonality. However, with only 96 points, we are limited.\n\n 3. We can use models like SARIMA, but the seasonality period is 24. However, with only 4 days, fitting a seasonal model with period 24 might be challenging.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing, or even a naive seasonal method. But given the requirement for 96 points, we need a model that can project forward.\n\n 5. Considering the constraints, we have to make a choice. We can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend: The data doesn't show a clear long-term trend in 4 days, but there are daily patterns.\n    - Seasonality: We will assume daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 6. We can use a seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day. However, the data from day to day is not exactly the same.\n\n 7. Another option is to use an average of the four days for each hour? But that would ignore any trend.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a model that averages the same hour across the four days and then adds a small adjustment for the next days.\n\n 9. However, note that the problem says there are missing values in the data, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n 10. We decide to use a simple approach: \n     - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n     - Then we forecast the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating this daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 11. But note: the data shows that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. However, without more data, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-04) as the pattern for the next days? But the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days.\n\n 13. Since the problem states that the dataset is subdivided and we are only given 4 days, we must work with what we have.\n\n 14. We choose to use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 15. Steps for averaging:\n     - Group the data by hour (i.e., 0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n 16. Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 17. However, note that the last provided date is 2016-10-04 23:00:00. So the next 96 hours are:\n     2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00.\n\n 18. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 19. But wait: the problem says the next 96 recorded dates. Since the data is hourly, we generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 20. Implementation:\n\n     Step 1: Parse the given data and note that the index is the date.\n\n     Step 2: Extract the hour from the datetime.\n\n     Step 3: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n     Step 4: Create a sequence of datetimes for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-10-05 00:00:00.\n\n     Step 5: For each datetime in the future, get the hour and assign the corresponding average value.\n\n 21. However, note: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We are not going to adjust for trend.\n\n 22. This method will produce a constant daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 23. But the problem says there are missing values in the data? We are not told which ones are missing in the provided data. We assume the provided 96 are complete.\n\n 24. Let's compute the hourly averages from the provided data.\n\n 25. Example: for hour 0, we have:\n        2016-10-01 00:00:00 -> 3.020\n        2016-10-02 00:00:00 -> 0.604\n        2016-10-03 00:00:00 -> 1.954\n        2016-10-04 00:00:00 -> 3.553\n        Average = (3.020 + 0.604 + 1.954 + 3.553) / 4 = 9.131 / 4 = 2.28275\n\n 26. Similarly for other hours.\n\n 27. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. Then for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 29. We must format the output exactly as the input, but for the next 96 hours.\n\n 30. The output should be in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MULL', with the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.\n\n 31. We write the answer in the required XML tag.\n\n 32. Let's do the computation.\n\n 33. We note: the provided data ends at 2016-10-04 23:00:00. The next hour is 2016-10-05 00:00:00.\n\n 34. We generate:\n        date: from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00 (96 hours)\n\n 35. For each hour in [0,23] for 4 days, we assign the precomputed average for that hour.\n\n 36. We'll compute the averages for each hour.\n\n 37. Code for averaging (we'll do it manually in our mind, but we can write a table):\n\n     Hour 0: [3.020, 0.604, 1.954, 3.553] -> 2.28275\n     Hour 1: [3.234, 0.284, 1.990, 3.234] -> (3.234+0.284+1.990+3.234)/4 = 8.742/4 = 2.1855\n        But wait, let me check the data for hour 1:\n            2016-10-01 01:00:00: 3.234\n            2016-10-02 01:00:00: 0.284\n            2016-10-03 01:00:00: 1.990\n            2016-10-04 01:00:00: 3.234? Actually, the data for 2016-10-04 01:00:00 is 3.234? \n            Looking: \n                2016-10-04 01:00:00: 3.234? \n                The data: \n                    2016-10-04 00:00:00 3.553\n                    2016-10-04 01:00:00 3.234   -> yes.\n\n        So: 3.234 + 0.284 + 1.990 + 3.234 = 8.742 -> 2.1855\n\n     We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 38. However, note: the data for 2016-10-02 01:00:00 is 0.284, but the hour 1 is the same as 01:00:00.\n\n 39. We'll create a list for each hour.\n\n 40. Since it's a lot, we can do it programmatically in our reasoning, but for the answer we just need the forecast.\n\n 41. Alternatively, we can write a small table of the averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (3.020 + 0.604 + 1.954 + 3.553) / 4 = 2.28275\n     Hour 1: (3.234 + 0.284 + 1.990 + 3.234) / 4 = 2.1855\n     Hour 2: (3.198 + 0.391 + 1.954 + 3.411) / 4 = (3.198+0.391+1.954+3.411)=8.954/4=2.2385\n     Hour 3: (2.985 + 0.391 + 2.061 + 3.411) / 4 = (2.985+0.391+2.061+3.411)=8.848/4=2.212\n     Hour 4: (2.985 + 1.208 + 1.244 + 2.701) / 4 = (2.985+1.208+1.244+2.701)=8.138/4=2.0345\n     Hour 5: (2.061 + 0.071 + 1.492 + 2.416) / 4 = (2.061+0.071+1.492+2.416)=6.04/4=1.51\n     Hour 6: (1.919 + 0.320 + 1.066 + 3.198) / 4 = (1.919+0.320+1.066+3.198)=6.503/4=1.62575\n     Hour 7: (2.594 + 0.320 + 1.635 + 3.092) / 4 = (2.594+0.320+1.635+3.092)=7.641/4=1.91025\n     Hour 8: (1.954 + 0.888 + 1.706 + 2.843) / 4 = (1.954+0.888+1.706+2.843)=7.391/4=1.84775\n     Hour 9: (1.670 + 1.031 + 1.706 + 2.310) / 4 = (1.670+1.031+1.706+2.310)=6.717/4=1.67925\n     Hour 10: (1.706 + 1.421 + 1.564 + 2.878) / 4 = (1.706+1.421+1.564+2.878)=7.569/4=1.89225\n     Hour 11: (1.777 + 1.208 + 1.315 + 2.594) / 4 = (1.777+1.208+1.315+2.594)=6.894/4=1.7235\n     Hour 12: (1.777 + 0.569 + 0.853 + 2.416) / 4 = (1.777+0.569+0.853+2.416)=5.615/4=1.40375\n     Hour 13: (1.990 + 0.675 + 1.599 + 1.954) / 4 = (1.990+0.675+1.599+1.954)=6.218/4=1.5545\n     Hour 14: (2.061 + 0.888 + 1.812 + 1.919) / 4 = (2.061+0.888+1.812+1.919)=6.68/4=1.67\n     Hour 15: (1.848 + 1.315 + 1.954 + 3.056) / 4 = (1.848+1.315+1.954+3.056)=8.173/4=2.04325\n     Hour 16: (1.244 + 0.888 + 1.635 + 2.274) / 4 = (1.244+0.888+1.635+2.274)=6.041/4=1.51025\n     Hour 17: (1.528 + 0.746 + 1.279 + 2.097) / 4 = (1.528+0.746+1.279+2.097)=5.65/4=1.4125\n     Hour 18: (1.244 + 0.249 + 1.066 + 1.812) / 4 = (1.244+0.249+1.066+1.812)=4.371/4=1.09275\n     Hour 19: (1.244 + 0.426 + 1.350 + 1.599) / 4 = (1.244+0.426+1.350+1.599)=4.619/4=1.15475\n     Hour 20: (1.102 + 0.391 + 1.137 + 1.741) / 4 = (1.102+0.391+1.137+1.741)=4.371/4=1.09275\n     Hour 21: (1.031 + 0.355 + 0.746 + 1.102) / 4 = (1.031+0.355+0.746+1.102)=3.234/4=0.8085\n     Hour 22: (0.959 + 1.031 + 0.853 + 1.919) / 4 = (0.959+1.031+0.853+1.919)=4.762/4=1.1905\n     Hour 23: (0.391 + 1.599 + 2.487 + 3.482) / 4 = (0.391+1.599+2.487+3.482)=7.959/4=1.98975\n\n 42. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-10-05\n        00:00:00 -> 2.28275\n        01:00:00 -> 2.1855\n        02:00:00 -> 2.2385\n        03:00:00 -> 2.212\n        04:00:00 -> 2.0345\n        05:00:00 -> 1.51\n        06:00:00 -> 1.62575\n        07:00:00 -> 1.91025\n        08:00:00 -> 1.84775\n        09:00:00 -> 1.67925\n        10:00:00 -> 1.89225\n        11:00:00 -> 1.7235\n        12:00:00 -> 1.40375\n        13:00:00 -> 1.5545\n        14:00:00 -> 1.67\n        15:00:00 -> 2.04325\n        16:00:00 -> 1.51025\n        17:00:00 -> 1.4125\n        18:00:00 -> 1.09275\n        19:00:00 -> 1.15475\n        20:00:00 -> 1.09275\n        21:00:00 -> 0.8085\n        22:00:00 -> 1.1905\n        23:00:00 -> 1.98975\n\n     Then repeat the same pattern for 2016-10-06, 2016-10-07, 2016-10-08.\n\n 43. We must format the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n 44. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 45. However, note: the input had values like 0.071, 0.320, etc. So we'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n        Hour0: 2.283\n        Hour1: 2.186\n        Hour2: 2.238\n        Hour3: 2.212\n        Hour4: 2.034\n        Hour5: 1.510\n        Hour6: 1.626\n        Hour7: 1.910\n        Hour8: 1.848\n        Hour9: 1.679\n        Hour10: 1.892\n        Hour11: 1.724   (because 1.7235 rounds to 1.724)\n        Hour12: 1.404   (1.40375 -> 1.404)\n        Hour13: 1.555   (1.5545 -> 1.555)\n        But note: 1.5545 is exactly halfway? We round to even? But typically in such contexts we round to 3 decimal by standard rounding.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n        Hour0: 2.28275 -> 2.283\n        Hour1: 2.1855 -> 2.186\n        Hour2: 2.2385 -> 2.238 (since 2.2385 is exactly 2.2385, rounding to nearest even at the 4th decimal? \n                Actually, 2.2385: the digit in the 4th decimal is 5, then we look at the 3rd: 8 -> even? \n                But standard rounding: 2.2385 -> 2.238? or 2.239? \n                Actually, the rule: round half away from zero? \n                We'll use: 2.2385 -> 2.239? But let me check: \n                2.2385: the 4th decimal is 5, so we add 1 to the 3rd decimal: 8+1=9 -> 2.239? \n                However, in many systems, it's round half to even. But 8 is even? \n                Actually, the common rule in statistics is to round to the nearest even digit when exactly at 0.5. \n                But 8 is even? We don't change. \n                The rule: \n                  If the digit to be removed is 5 and there are no digits following or only zeros, then:\n                  - round to the nearest even digit for the digit in the place we are rounding to.\n\n                We are rounding to 3 decimals: so we are at the thousandths place. \n                The digit in the thousandths place is 8, and the next is 5. \n                Since 8 is even, we leave it? But actually, the rule applies when the digit to be rounded is followed by exactly 5 and nothing else? \n                Actually, 2.2385: \n                  We look at the 4th decimal: 5, and then we look at the 3rd: 8 -> which is even -> so we leave it? \n                But that doesn't make sense because 8 is even and we leave it? Then 2.2385 -> 2.238? \n                However, that is not the common practice. The common practice is to round 2.2385 to 2.239. \n\n                Let me clarify: \n                The rule: \n                  Round half up: 2.2385 -> 2.239 (because 5 or above, round up)\n                This is the most common.\n\n                We'll use round half up.\n\n                So:\n                2.2385 -> 2.239\n                1.7235 -> 1.724\n                1.40375: to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal: 7 -> which is above 5, so round up: 1.404\n                1.5545: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 1.555\n\n        So we'll round half up.\n\n        Let's recalc:\n\n        Hour0: 2.28275 -> 2.283 (because 7>=5, so round up the 2 to 3? \n                Actually: \n                  2.28275: \n                    thousandths: 2, next digit 7 -> so round up the 2 to 3 -> 2.283\n                But wait, 2.28275: \n                  tenths: 2, hundredths: 8, thousandths: 2, and then 7 (ten thousandths) -> so we look at the ten thousandths: 7>=5 -> round up the thousandths: 2+1=3 -> 2.283\n\n        So:\n\n        Hour0: 2.283\n        Hour1: 2.186\n        Hour2: 2.2385 -> 2.239 (because 8 in thousandths, then 5 -> round up 8 to 9 -> 2.239)\n        Hour3: 2.212 -> 2.212 (exactly, so 2.212)\n        Hour4: 2.0345 -> 2.034 (because 4 in thousandths, then 5 -> but wait: 2.0345: \n                thousandths: 4, next is 5 -> round up 4 to 5? -> 2.035? \n                Actually: 2.0345: \n                  thousandths is 4, the next digit is 5 -> so we round up: 4+1=5 -> 2.035\n\n        We must be consistent: round half up.\n\n        Let me do all:\n\n        Hour0: 2.28275 -> 2.283\n        Hour1: 2.1855 -> 2.186 (because 5 in the 4th decimal: round up the 5 in the 3rd? but 5 in the 3rd? \n                Actually: 2.1855: \n                  thousandths: 5, then next is 5 -> round up the 5 to 6? -> 2.186\n        Hour2: 2.2385 -> 2.239\n        Hour3: 2.212 -> 2.212 (but wait, we computed 2.212? Actually we had 2.212 exactly? \n                But our calculation was 8.848/4=2.212 -> so 2.212 -> 2.212\n        Hour4: 2.0345 -> 2.035\n        Hour5: 1.51 -> 1.510 (but we computed 1.51 -> that is 1.51000 -> 1.510)\n        Hour6: 1.62575 -> 1.626\n        Hour7: 1.91025 -> 1.910\n        Hour8: 1.84775 -> 1.848\n        Hour9: 1.67925 -> 1.679\n        Hour10: 1.89225 -> 1.892\n        Hour11: 1.7235 -> 1.724\n        Hour12: 1.40375 -> 1.404\n        Hour13: 1.5545 -> 1.555\n        Hour14: 1.67 -> 1.670 (but we computed 1.67? Actually 6.68/4=1.67 -> so 1.670)\n        Hour15: 2.04325 -> 2.043\n        Hour16: 1.51025 -> 1.510\n        Hour17: 1.4125 -> 1.413 (because 2 in thousandths, then 5 -> round up to 3 -> 1.413)\n        Hour18: 1.09275 -> 1.093\n        Hour19: 1.15475 -> 1.155\n        Hour20: 1.09275 -> 1.093\n        Hour21: 0.8085 -> 0.809\n        Hour22: 1.1905 -> 1.191\n        Hour23: 1.98975 -> 1.990\n\n 47. But wait, let me double-check a few:\n\n        Hour0: 2.28275 -> \n            thousandths: 2, then 7 -> round up -> 2.283\n        Hour1: 2.1855 -> \n            thousandths: 5, then 5 -> round up the 5 to 6 -> 2.186\n        Hour2: 2.2385 -> \n            thousandths: 8, then 5 -> round up 8 to 9 -> 2.239\n        Hour3: 2.212 -> exactly 2.212 -> 2.212\n        Hour4: 2.0345 -> \n            thousandths: 4, then 5 -> round up 4 to 5 -> 2.035\n        Hour5: 1.51 -> 1.510 (we have 1.51, which is 1.51000 -> 1.510)\n        Hour6: 1.62575 -> \n            thousandths: 5, then 7 -> round up 5 to 6 -> 1.626\n        Hour7: 1.91025 -> \n            thousandths: 0, then 2 -> no round -> 1.910\n        But wait: 1.91025: \n            The thousandths digit is 0, the next digit is 2 -> which is less than 5 -> so 1.910\n        Hour8: 1.84775 -> \n            thousandths: 7, then 7 -> round up 7 to 8 -> 1.848\n        Hour9: 1.67925 -> \n            thousandths: 9, then 2 -> no round? but wait: 1.67925: \n            thousandths: 9, then 2 -> so we leave the 9 -> 1.679\n        But 1.67925: \n            We are at the thousandths: 9, and the next digit is 2 -> so we leave it -> 1.679\n        However, note: 1.67925 is 1.679 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n            Actually, 1.67925: \n                The digit in the 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5 -> so we leave -> 1.679\n\n        Hour10: 1.89225 -> \n            thousandths: 2, then 2 -> leave -> 1.892\n        Hour11: 1.7235 -> \n            thousandths: 3, then 5 -> round up 3 to 4 -> 1.724\n        Hour12: 1.40375 -> \n            thousandths: 3, then 7 -> round up 3 to 4 -> 1.404\n        Hour13: 1.5545 -> \n            thousandths: 4, then 5 -> round up 4 to 5 -> 1.555\n        Hour14: 1.67 -> 1.670 (we output 1.670)\n        Hour15: 2.04325 -> \n            thousandths: 3, then 2 -> leave -> 2.043\n        Hour16: 1.51025 -> \n            thousandths: 0, then 2 -> leave -> 1.510\n        Hour17: 1.4125 -> \n            thousandths: 2, then 5 -> round up 2 to 3 -> 1.413\n        Hour18: 1.09275 -> \n            thousandths: 2, then 7 -> round up 2 to 3 -> 1.093\n        Hour19: 1.15475 -> \n            thousandths: 4, then 7 -> round up 4 to 5 -> 1.155\n        Hour20: 1.09275 -> same as hour18: 1.093\n        Hour21: 0.8085 -> \n            thousandths: 8, then 5 -> round up 8 to 9 -> 0.809\n        Hour22: 1.1905 -> \n            thousandths: 0, then 5 -> round up 0 to 1 -> 1.191\n        But wait: 1.1905: \n            thousandths: 0, then 5 -> so we round up the 0 to 1 -> 1.191\n        However, note: 1.1905: \n            The thousandths digit is 0, and the next is 5 -> so we round up the 0 to 1 -> 1.191\n        Hour23: 1.98975 -> \n            thousandths: 9, then 7 -> round up 9 to 10 -> so we get 1.990 (because 1.989 + 0.001 = 1.990)\n\n 48. So the hourly averages (rounded) are:\n\n        Hour0: 2.283\n        Hour1: 2.186\n        Hour2: 2.239\n        Hour3: 2.212\n        Hour4: 2.035\n        Hour5: 1.510\n        Hour6: 1.626\n        Hour7: 1.910\n        Hour8: 1.848\n        Hour9: 1.679\n        Hour10: 1.892\n        Hour11: 1.724\n        Hour12: 1.404\n        Hour13: 1.555\n        Hour14: 1.670\n        Hour15: 2.043\n        Hour16: 1.510\n        Hour17: 1.413\n        Hour18: 1.093\n        Hour19: 1.155\n        Hour20: 1.093\n        Hour21: 0.809\n        Hour22: 1.191\n        Hour23: 1.990\n\n 49. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-05 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 2.283\n        Then 2016-10-05 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 2.186\n        ... until 2016-10-05 23:00:00 -> 1.990\n\n        Then 2016-10-06 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 2.283\n        ... and so on.\n\n 50. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-05 00:00:00 2.283\n2016-10-05 01:00:00 2.186\n...\n2016-10-08 23:00:00 1.990\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 51. We must have 96 lines.\n\n 52. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-05 (24 hours)\n        Day2: 2016-10-06\n        Day3: 2016-10-07\n        Day4: 2016-10-08\n\n 53. We output:\n\n        date string: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 54. We note that the hour part: \n        0 -> \"00:00:00\"\n        1 -> \"01:00:00\"\n        ...\n        23 -> \"23:00:00\"\n\n 55.
