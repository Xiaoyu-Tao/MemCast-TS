        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-24 00:00:00 to 2017-07-27 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided sample for the past 96 points is complete. We will assume that for forecasting we can use the given data without imputation for the past.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n 3. We note that the data has a daily pattern (temperature rises during the day and falls at night) and possibly weekly patterns (but we only have 4 days).\n\n 4. We can use a time series model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need for 96-step ahead, we might use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) if we can capture seasonality. But note: we have only 4 days, so daily seasonality (period=24) is present, but we have only 4 cycles.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simple model like ARIMA, but with 96 steps ahead, the forecast might degrade.\n\n 5. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n 6. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We'll generate the timestamps and the forecasted OT.\n\n 7. We'll use a model that can handle seasonality. Since we have hourly data and daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 8. Given the small data, we might use ETS with additive seasonality and trend. But note: the data does not show a clear long-term trend over 4 days, but there is a daily cycle.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 10. We'll use a simple approach: \n     - Since we are required to provide 96 points and the data is short, we can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting.\n\n 11. We choose to use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components. But with only 4 days, decomposing a 24-hour seasonality might be weak.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a linear model with time features (hour of day, day of week) but we only have 4 days (so day of week: Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun) and then we are forecasting for Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu? \n     Actually: \n        Last date: 2017-07-23 is Sunday)\n        Next 96 hours: \n          2017-07-24 (Monday) to 2017-07-27 (Thursday)\n\n 13. We can use a model that uses the hour of the day as a categorical variable and the day of the week. But we have 4 days of history and we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the average of the same hour from the available days? \n     However, note that the pattern might change by day of week (weekday vs. weekday). But we have:\n        Thu (2017-07-20), Fri (2017-07-21), Sat (2017-07-22), Sun (2017-07-23) -> then forecast Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu.\n\n     We don't have a Monday in the history to base the Monday forecast on. So we might have to use the average of the same hour over the available days and then adjust for the day of week? But we don't have enough data for that.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide an answer, we will use a simple average of the same hour from the 4 available days to forecast the next 4 days. But note: the next 4 days are weekdays (Mon to Thu) and the history includes weekend days (Sat, Sun). This might not be accurate.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a time series model that doesn't rely on day of week. We'll use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) with a period of 24.\n\n 16. We'll use the `statsmodels` library for ETS or SARIMA. But since we are in a text-based environment, we cannot run code. We have to simulate the forecast.\n\n 17. However, note: the problem does not require the method, only the data. So we can use a simple method to generate the forecast.\n\n 18. We decide to use the average of the same hour from the 4 available days. For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days (2017-07-20 to 2017-07-23). Then we use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days (2017-07-24 to 2017-07-27).\n\n 19. Steps for the first hour (00:00:00) of the next 4 days:\n        We have:\n            2017-07-20 00:00:00 -> 21.174\n            2017-07-21 00:00:00 -> 20.049\n            2017-07-22 00:00:00 -> 21.456\n            2017-07-23 00:00:00 -> 21.878\n        Average = (21.174 + 20.049 + 21.456 + 21.878) / 4 = 21.13925\n\n     Then for 2017-07-24 00:00:00, we use 21.13925.\n\n 20. Similarly, for 01:00:00:\n        2017-07-20 01:00:00: 21.104\n        2017-07-21 01:00:00: 20.963\n        2017-07-22 01:00:00: 21.034\n        2017-07-23 01:00:00: 22.089\n        Average = (21.104+20.963+21.034+22.089)/4 = 21.2975\n\n 21. We do this for each hour (0 to 23) and then repeat the same pattern for the 4 days.\n\n 22. But note: the next 4 days are 96 hours. We have 24 hours per day, so 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n 23. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then replicate that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 24. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to tell. We are not accounting for any trend.\n\n 25. This method is simple and can be done manually.\n\n 26. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    hour0: (21.174 + 20.049 + 21.456 + 21.878) / 4 = (21.174+20.049=41.223; 41.223+21.456=62.679; 62.679+21.878=84.557) -> 84.557/4 = 21.13925\n    hour1: (21.104+20.963+21.034+22.089) = 21.104+20.963=42.067; 42.067+21.034=63.101; 63.101+22.089=85.19 -> 85.19/4=21.2975\n    hour2: (21.385+20.752+21.385+22.089) = 21.385+20.752=42.137; 42.137+21.385=63.522; 63.522+22.089=85.611 -> 85.611/4=21.40275\n    hour3: (21.456+20.471+21.174+22.159) = 21.456+20.471=41.927; 41.927+21.174=63.101; 63.101+22.159=85.26 -> 85.26/4=21.315\n    hour4: (21.174+19.838+21.315+21.878) = 21.174+19.838=41.012; 41.012+21.315=62.327; 62.327+21.878=84.205 -> 84.205/4=21.05125\n    hour5: (20.893+19.838+20.401+21.737) = 20.893+19.838=40.731; 40.731+20.401=61.132; 61.132+21.737=82.869 -> 82.869/4=20.71725\n    hour6: (20.401+19.979+21.104+21.737) = 20.401+19.979=40.38; 40.38+21.104=61.484; 61.484+21.737=83.221 -> 83.221/4=20.80525\n    hour7: (22.089+21.245+22.722+22.652) = 22.089+21.245=43.334; 43.334+22.722=66.056; 66.056+22.652=88.708 -> 88.708/4=22.177\n    hour8: (23.637+22.863+24.340+24.481) = 23.637+22.863=46.5; 46.5+24.340=70.84; 70.84+24.481=95.321 -> 95.321/4=23.83025\n    hour9: (23.003+22.652+23.355+24.762) = 23.003+22.652=45.655; 45.655+23.355=69.01; 69.01+24.762=93.772 -> 93.772/4=23.443\n    hour10: (22.300+21.385+23.144+24.692) = 22.300+21.385=43.685; 43.685+23.144=66.829; 66.829+24.692=91.521 -> 91.521/4=22.88025\n    hour11: (22.089+21.385+23.848+24.551) = 22.089+21.385=43.474; 43.474+23.848=67.322; 67.322+24.551=91.873 -> 91.873/4=22.96825\n    hour12: (22.300+21.737+23.918+24.410) = 22.300+21.737=44.037; 44.037+23.918=67.955; 67.955+24.410=92.365 -> 92.365/4=23.09125\n    hour13: (21.667+22.442+24.340+24.410) = 21.667+22.442=44.109; 44.109+24.340=68.449; 68.449+24.410=92.859 -> 92.859/4=23.21475\n    hour14: (21.456+23.074+25.606+25.817) = 21.456+23.074=44.53; 44.53+25.606=70.136; 70.136+25.817=95.953 -> 95.953/4=23.98825\n    hour15: (22.933+24.410+26.591+25.747) = 22.933+24.410=47.343; 47.343+26.591=73.934; 73.934+25.747=99.681 -> 99.681/4=24.92025\n    hour16: (22.441+23.566+26.521+26.239) = 22.441+23.566=46.007; 46.007+26.521=72.528; 72.528+26.239=98.767 -> 98.767/4=24.69175\n    hour17: (23.496+23.848+25.958+26.239) = 23.496+23.848=47.344; 47.344+25.958=73.302; 73.302+26.239=99.541 -> 99.541/4=24.88525\n    hour18: (21.878+23.144+24.692+24.621) = 21.878+23.144=45.022; 45.022+24.692=69.714; 69.714+24.621=94.335 -> 94.335/4=23.58375\n    hour19: (21.526+23.144+22.370+22.300) = 21.526+23.144=44.67; 44.67+22.370=67.04; 67.04+22.300=89.34 -> 89.34/4=22.335\n    hour20: (21.245+21.808+21.385+22.089) = 21.245+21.808=43.053; 43.053+21.385=64.438; 64.438+22.089=86.527 -> 86.527/4=21.63175\n    hour21: (21.245+21.315+20.963+21.878) = 21.245+21.315=42.56; 42.56+20.963=63.523; 63.523+21.878=85.401 -> 85.401/4=21.35025\n    hour22: (20.190+21.385+21.737+22.019) = 20.190+21.385=41.575; 41.575+21.737=63.312; 63.312+22.019=85.331 -> 85.331/4=21.33275\n    hour23: (20.752+21.245+21.948+21.808) = 20.752+21.245=41.997; 41.997+21.948=63.945; 63.945+21.808=85.753 -> 85.753/4=21.43825\n\n 27. Now, we have 24 average values for the 24 hours. We will assign these averages to each hour of the next 4 days.\n\n 28. The next 96 hours (starting from 2017-07-24 00:00:00 to 2017-07-27 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-07-24, Monday): \n            00:00:00 -> 21.13925\n            01:00:00 -> 21.2975\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 21.43825\n\n        Day 2 (2017-07-25, Tuesday): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (2017-07-26, Wednesday): same 24 values\n        Day 4 (2017-07-27, Thursday): same 24 values\n\n 29. We must format the dates and the OT values. We'll round the OT to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 30. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places, but the numbers are floats. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. But note: the input data has some values with 3 decimal places and some with 2 or 1? Actually, they are given with up to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. We'll output the data in the same way.\n\n 33. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-24 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-24 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-24 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-25 00:00:00 ... until 2017-07-25 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-26 00:00:00 ... until 2017-07-26 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-27 00:00:00 ... until 2017-07-27 23:00:00\n\n 34. We have the OT values for each hour as the average we computed for that hour of the day.\n\n 35. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-24 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-07-24 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-07-27 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 36. We must be cautious: the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. Let's list the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimal places):\n\n        hour0: 21.139 -> 21.139\n        hour1: 21.298 -> 21.298\n        hour2: 21.403 -> 21.403\n        hour3: 21.315 -> 21.315\n        hour4: 21.051 -> 21.051\n        hour5: 20.717 -> 20.717\n        hour6: 20.805 -> 20.805\n        hour7: 22.177 -> 22.177\n        hour8: 23.830 -> 23.830\n        hour9: 23.443 -> 23.443\n        hour10: 22.880 -> 22.880\n        hour11: 22.968 -> 22.968\n        hour12: 23.091 -> 23.091\n        hour13: 23.215 -> 23.215\n        hour14: 23.988 -> 23.988\n        hour15: 24.920 -> 24.920\n        hour16: 24.692 -> 24.692\n        hour17: 24.885 -> 24.885\n        hour18: 23.584 -> 23.584\n        hour19: 22.335 -> 22.335\n        hour20: 21.632 -> 21.632\n        hour21: 21.350 -> 21.350\n        hour22: 21.333 -> 21.333\n        hour23: 21.438 -> 21.438\n\n 38. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-07-24): \n            00:00:00 -> 21.139\n            01:00:00 -> 21.298\n            02:00:00 -> 21.403\n            03:00:00 -> 21.315\n            04:00:00 -> 21.051\n            05:00:00 -> 20.717\n            06:00:00 -> 20.805\n            07:00:00 -> 22.177\n            08:00:00 -> 23.830\n            09:00:00 -> 23.443\n            10:00:00 -> 22.880\n            11:00:00 -> 22.968\n            12:00:00 -> 23.091\n            13:00:00 -> 23.215\n            14:00:00 -> 23.988\n            15:00:00 -> 24.920\n            16:00:00 -> 24.692\n            17:00:00 -> 24.885\n            18:00:00 -> 23.584\n            19:00:00 -> 22.335\n            20:00:00 -> 21.632\n            21:00:00 -> 21.350\n            22:00:00 -> 21.333\n            23:00:00 -> 21.438\n\n        Day 2 (2017-07-25): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (2017-07-26): same 24 values\n        Day 4 (2017-07-27): same 24 values\n\n 39.
