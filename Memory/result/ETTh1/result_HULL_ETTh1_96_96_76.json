        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-05 00:00:00 to 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So for forecasting, we can use the given 96 points.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are dealing with hourly data and only 96 points, we can consider methods like:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters if seasonality is present)\n    - Prophet (if there are multiple seasonalities, but we have only 4 days so seasonality might be daily)\n\n 3. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be a daily pattern: \n        * On 2017-05-01: values start at 3.349 (midnight), then decrease to negative in the afternoon, and then increase at night.\n        * Similar pattern on the next days, but the magnitude varies.\n\n 4. Since we have only 4 days, it's challenging to capture weekly seasonality, but we can try to capture daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n 6. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - Check stationarity: if not stationary, we may need to difference (both regular and seasonal).\n    - Identify orders (p,d,q) and seasonal orders (P,D,Q,s) with s=24.\n\n 7. However, note that the data is only 96 points and we are to forecast 96 points. We must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) with a period of 24.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without the ability to run extensive model selection (as we are in a simulated environment), we will use a practical approach.\n\n 10. We can use the `statsmodels` library in Python to fit a seasonal ARIMA model. But note: we are to provide the forecast without running actual code? \n\n 11. Since this is a simulation, I will describe the steps and then provide a forecast. However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 12. We are to generate the next 96 timestamps and corresponding HULL values.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, I will generate a forecast using a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour. That is, for hour 00:00, we take the average of the 00:00 of the 4 days we have, and so on for each hour.\n\n    - However, note that the data does not have a clear consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n        Day1: 00:00 -> 3.349\n        Day2: 00:00 -> 0.670\n        Day3: 00:00 -> 0.938\n        Day4: 00:00 -> 1.139\n\n        Average for 00:00: (3.349 + 0.670 + 0.938 + 1.139) / 4 = 1.524\n\n    - Similarly, for 01:00:\n        Day1: 2.612\n        Day2: 0.603\n        Day3: 0.938\n        Day4: 1.139\n        Average: (2.612+0.603+0.938+1.139)/4 = 1.323\n\n    - But note: the data on day1 is much higher than the others. This might be because day1 is a special day? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent days.\n\n 15. Given the short history, we can also consider a naive seasonal forecast: using the last day (day4) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be too simplistic.\n\n 16. Another idea: use the median of the same hour over the past 4 days to reduce the effect of outliers.\n\n    For 00:00: [3.349, 0.670, 0.938, 1.139] -> sorted: [0.670, 0.938, 1.139, 3.349] -> median = (0.938+1.139)/2 = 1.0385\n\n 17. However, the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we don't have to handle missing values in the input.\n\n 18. Considering the above, I will use the median of the same hour over the past 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps for generating the next 96 points:\n\n        For hour h (from 0 to 23) in the next 4 days (from 2017-05-05 to 2017-05-08):\n            Let h0 = h, h1 = h+24, h2 = h+48, h3 = h+72 (the same hour in the 4 days we have)\n            Compute median of [value_h0, value_h1, value_h2, value_h3]\n\n        Then assign that median to the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 20. But note: the next 4 days are 2017-05-05, 2017-05-06, 2017-05-07, 2017-05-08.\n\n 21. However, we are using the same pattern for each of the next 4 days? That is, the same median value for the same hour in each of the next 4 days? That would be a constant pattern. \n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the median for the first day (2017-05-05) and then for the next days, we can add a small random variation? But the problem does not allow randomness.\n\n 23. Or we can use the median as a base and then adjust by the trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 24. Since we are not given more data, and we must provide 96 points, we will use the median for each hour and repeat the same daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 25. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n        Hour 00: [3.349, 0.670, 0.938, 1.139] -> sorted: [0.670, 0.938, 1.139, 3.349] -> median = (0.938+1.139)/2 = 1.0385\n        Hour 01: [2.612, 0.603, 0.938, 1.139] -> sorted: [0.603, 0.938, 1.139, 2.612] -> median = (0.938+1.139)/2 = 1.0385\n        Hour 02: [2.545, 0.938, 1.072, 1.608] -> sorted: [0.938, 1.072, 1.608, 2.545] -> median = (1.072+1.608)/2 = 1.340\n        Hour 03: [2.679, 0.871, 0.402, 1.474] -> sorted: [0.402, 0.871, 1.474, 2.679] -> median = (0.871+1.474)/2 = 1.1725\n        Hour 04: [2.210, 0.938, 0.603, 0.871] -> sorted: [0.603, 0.871, 0.938, 2.210] -> median = (0.871+0.938)/2 = 0.9045\n        Hour 05: [2.344, 0.603, 0.804, 1.273] -> sorted: [0.603, 0.804, 1.273, 2.344] -> median = (0.804+1.273)/2 = 1.0385\n        Hour 06: [2.612, 1.273, 1.005, 0.871] -> sorted: [0.871, 1.005, 1.273, 2.612] -> median = (1.005+1.273)/2 = 1.139\n        Hour 07: [1.674, 0.871, 0.737, 0.670] -> sorted: [0.670, 0.737, 0.871, 1.674] -> median = (0.737+0.871)/2 = 0.804\n        Hour 08: [1.005, 1.005, 0.670, 0.871] -> sorted: [0.670, 0.871, 1.005, 1.005] -> median = (0.871+1.005)/2 = 0.938\n        Hour 09: [0.603, 0.670, 0.871, 0.201] -> sorted: [0.201, 0.603, 0.670, 0.871] -> median = (0.603+0.670)/2 = 0.6365\n        Hour 10: [1.005, 0.737, 0.737, 0.938] -> sorted: [0.737, 0.737, 0.938, 1.005] -> median = (0.737+0.938)/2 = 0.8375\n        Hour 11: [0.000, 0.536, 0.603, 0.670] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.536, 0.603, 0.670] -> median = (0.536+0.603)/2 = 0.5695\n        Hour 12: [-0.268, -0.134, 0.000, 0.871] -> sorted: [-0.268, -0.134, 0.000, 0.871] -> median = (-0.134+0.000)/2 = -0.067\n        Hour 13: [0.000, 0.067, 0.670, 1.741] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.067, 0.670, 1.741] -> median = (0.067+0.670)/2 = 0.3685\n        Hour 14: [0.134, 0.268, 0.402, 0.938] -> sorted: [0.134, 0.268, 0.402, 0.938] -> median = (0.268+0.402)/2 = 0.335\n        Hour 15: [0.201, 0.670, 0.402, 0.737] -> sorted: [0.201, 0.402, 0.670, 0.737] -> median = (0.402+0.670)/2 = 0.536\n        Hour 16: [0.134, 0.603, 0.402, 0.670] -> sorted: [0.134, 0.402, 0.603, 0.670] -> median = (0.402+0.603)/2 = 0.5025\n        Hour 17: [0.201, 0.402, 0.335, 0.402] -> sorted: [0.201, 0.335, 0.402, 0.402] -> median = (0.335+0.402)/2 = 0.3685\n        Hour 18: [0.067, 0.000, 0.134, 0.000] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.000, 0.067, 0.134] -> median = (0.000+0.067)/2 = 0.0335\n        Hour 19: [0.067, 0.134, 0.000, 0.067] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.067, 0.067, 0.134] -> median = (0.067+0.067)/2 = 0.067\n        Hour 20: [0.268, 0.268, 0.268, 0.000] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.268, 0.268, 0.268] -> median = (0.268+0.268)/2 = 0.268\n        Hour 21: [0.067, 0.268, 0.067, 0.000] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.067, 0.067, 0.268] -> median = (0.067+0.067)/2 = 0.067\n        Hour 22: [0.268, 0.067, 0.067, 0.000] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.067, 0.067, 0.268] -> median = (0.067+0.067)/2 = 0.067\n        Hour 23: [0.335, 0.335, 0.670, 1.741] -> sorted: [0.335, 0.335, 0.670, 1.741] -> median = (0.335+0.670)/2 = 0.5025\n\n 26. Now, we will use these median values for each hour and repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days (2017-05-05 to 2017-05-08).\n\n 27. The forecast for 2017-05-05 00:00:00 is 1.0385, 2017-05-05 01:00:00 is 1.0385, and so on.\n\n 28. We must format the answer exactly as the input, with the same datetime format and the HULL value rounded to 3 decimal places (as in the input).\n\n 29. Let's round the medians to 3 decimal places:\n\n        Hour 00: 1.0385 -> 1.039\n        Hour 01: 1.0385 -> 1.039\n        Hour 02: 1.340 -> 1.340\n        Hour 03: 1.1725 -> 1.173\n        Hour 04: 0.9045 -> 0.905\n        Hour 05: 1.0385 -> 1.039\n        Hour 06: 1.139 -> 1.139\n        Hour 07: 0.804 -> 0.804\n        Hour 08: 0.938 -> 0.938\n        Hour 09: 0.6365 -> 0.637\n        Hour 10: 0.8375 -> 0.838\n        Hour 11: 0.5695 -> 0.570\n        Hour 12: -0.067 -> -0.067\n        Hour 13: 0.3685 -> 0.369\n        Hour 14: 0.335 -> 0.335\n        Hour 15: 0.536 -> 0.536\n        Hour 16: 0.5025 -> 0.503\n        Hour 17: 0.3685 -> 0.369\n        Hour 18: 0.0335 -> 0.034\n        Hour 19: 0.067 -> 0.067\n        Hour 20: 0.268 -> 0.268\n        Hour 21: 0.067 -> 0.067\n        Hour 22: 0.067 -> 0.067\n        Hour 23: 0.5025 -> 0.503\n\n 30. Now, we create the next 96 points by repeating this daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 31. The first forecasted day: 2017-05-05\n        00:00:00 -> 1.039\n        01:00:00 -> 1.039\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.503\n\n 32. Then 2017-05-06, 2017-05-07, 2017-05-08: same pattern.\n\n 33. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-05 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-05-05 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n\n 34. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL', with the date in the format as given.\n\n 35. We output the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n 36. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 37. Let's write the forecasted data accordingly.\n\n 38. However, note: the last given data point is 2017-05-04 23:00:00. The next should be 2017-05-05 00:00:00.\n\n 39. We'll write 96 lines of forecast.\n\n 40. We'll generate the data in a tabular form as in the input.\n\n 41. We note that the input had 4 days of data (96 hours) and we are forecasting the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 42. We'll generate:\n\n        date                  HULL\n        2017-05-05 00:00:00  1.039\n        2017-05-05 01:00:00  1.039\n        ... \n\n 43. We'll do this for 4 days.\n\n 44. We must be cautious: the last day we have is 2017-05-04, so the next day is 2017-05-05.\n\n 45. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from 2017-05-05 00:00:00 to 2017-05-05 23:00:00 -> day1\n        then 2017-05-06 00:00:00 to 2017-05-06 23:00:00 -> day2\n        then 2017-05-07 00:00:00 to 2017-05-07 23:00:00 -> day3\n        then 2017-05-08 00:00:00 to 2017-05-08 23:00:00 -> day4\n\n 46. We assign the same hourly pattern for each day.\n\n 47. We write the data in the format.\n\n 48. We note that the input had the HULL values with 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 49. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 50. We enclose in the <answer> tag as specified.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n",
