        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any missing value in the given segment.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 4. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates (i.e., from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00).\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the data is relatively short (96 points) and we are forecasting 96 points (which is long),\n      we need a model that can capture seasonality and trends.\n\n    - The data shows:\n        * Daily seasonality: There seems to be a pattern every 24 hours. For example, on 2016-07-29 and 2016-07-30, we see negative values in the evening (around 20:00-22:00) and positive during the day.\n        * However, note that the last day (2016-07-31) is constant at 0.533 for all 24 hours. This might be an anomaly or missing data? But it is provided.\n\n    - We have to handle the constant day. It might be an outlier or a data collection issue. Since we are to forecast, we must use the available data.\n\n    - Given the small data size, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) which can handle seasonality.\n\n    - Steps for modeling:\n        a. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n        b. Determine the order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,s) for SARIMA. The seasonality period (s) is 24 (for daily seasonality in hourly data).\n\n    - However, note that we have only 4 days of data, so fitting a SARIMA model with 24-hour seasonality might be challenging because we have only 4 seasonal periods.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, or even a naive seasonal method.\n\n    - Given the constraints, we might use:\n        - Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day (2016-08-01). But the last day (2016-08-01) is not constant, so we can use that.\n        - However, the pattern on 2016-08-01 might be more representative than the constant day (2016-07-31). But we have to consider the entire history.\n\n    - Another idea: use the average of each hour over the available 4 days? But note that 2016-07-31 is constant and might distort the average.\n\n    - We can also use an average of the non-constant days? But the problem says to use the given data.\n\n    - Considering the challenge of fitting a complex model on 96 points for 96-step ahead forecast, we might use a simple method:\n\n        Method: We will use the last available day (2016-08-01) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 repetitions of 2016-08-01? \n        However, we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) and we have one day (24 hours) of pattern from 2016-08-01.\n\n        But note: the data from 2016-07-31 is constant and might be an anomaly. We have 3 non-constant days and one constant day.\n\n        Alternatively, we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days? But the constant day might pull the average to 0.533.\n\n        Let's look at the data:\n\n          Day 1 (2016-07-29): varying\n          Day 2 (2016-07-30): varying\n          Day 3 (2016-07-31): constant 0.533\n          Day 4 (2016-08-01): varying\n\n        We can try to remove the constant day? But the problem does not say we can clean the data.\n\n        Since the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have missing, we are to forecast as is.\n\n        We decide to use the average of each hour over the 4 days. This will account for the constant day as well.\n\n        Steps:\n          - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Then, we will use that hourly profile for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-02 to 2016-08-05).\n\n        Why 4 days? Because we have 4 days of history, and we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n        However, for the constant day (2016-07-31) we have 0.533 for every hour. This will make the average for each hour:\n\n          hour0: (1.812 + 0.213 + 0.533 + 1.279) / 4 = (1.812+0.213+0.533+1.279)/4 = 3.837/4 = 0.95925\n          ... and so on.\n\n        But note: the constant day might be an error. However, without domain knowledge, we must use the data as given.\n\n        This method will produce a forecast that repeats the same daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n        We generate the next 96 hours by starting from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 and then for each hour, we assign the average value for that hour.\n\n        However, note that the last day in the history is 2016-08-01. The next day starts at 2016-08-02 00:00:00.\n\n        We have 4 days: 2016-08-02, 2016-08-03, 2016-08-04, 2016-08-05.\n\n        How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n          hour0: average of [2016-07-29 00:00:00, 2016-07-30 00:00:00, 2016-07-31 00:00:00, 2016-08-01 00:00:00]\n          hour1: average of [2016-07-29 01:00:00, ... , 2016-08-01 01:00:00]\n          ... until hour23.\n\n        Then, for the next 24 hours (2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-02 23:00:00) we assign the 24 average values.\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for 2016-08-03, 2016-08-04, and 2016-08-05.\n\n        But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we can compute the average.\n\n        However, this method does not account for any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-08-01) as the pattern and repeat it 4 times? That might be more representative of the most recent pattern.\n\n        Let's compare:\n\n          Option 1: Average of all 4 days.\n          Option 2: Use only the last day (2016-08-01) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n        Why Option 2? Because the constant day (2016-07-31) might be an anomaly and the last day is the most recent and might be the most relevant.\n\n        But note: the problem does not specify any anomaly, so we must use all data.\n\n        We'll go with Option 1: average of each hour over the 4 days.\n\n        However, we must note that the constant day might be due to a holiday? But we don't have information.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we use the average.\n\n        But let's check the data: the constant day is 2016-07-31 which is a Sunday. The next days (2016-08-02 to 2016-08-05) are Tuesday to Friday? \n        Actually, 2016-07-29 is Friday), 2016-07-30 (Saturday), 2016-07-31 (Sunday), 2016-08-01 (Monday). \n        the next 4 days: 2016-08-02 (Tuesday), 2016-08-03 (Wednesday), 2016-08-04 (Thursday), 2016-08-05 (Friday).\n\n        So the constant day is Sunday, and we are forecasting Tuesday to Friday. Therefore, it might be better to use only the weekdays? \n\n        But we don't have enough data to separate weekdays and weekends.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n        Steps to compute:\n\n          We have 4 days, each with 24 hours -> 4 values per hour-of-day.\n\n          We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n          Day 1 (2016-08-02): [mean_hour0, mean_hour1, ..., mean_hour23]\n          Day 2 (2016-08-03): same as Day1\n          Day 3 (2016-08-04): same as Day1\n          Day 4 (2016-08-05): same as Day1\n\n        Why the same pattern every day? Because we don't have information to differentiate weekdays and weekends in the forecast period? \n        But note: the history includes Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. The forecast is for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n        We don't have a Tuesday in the history, so we cannot compute a Tuesday pattern. Therefore, we use the same daily pattern for all days.\n\n        This is a limitation.\n\n        Alternatively, we could use the last week same day? But we don't have a Tuesday in the history (the first day in history is Friday, then Saturday, Sunday, Monday). \n        We don't have a Tuesday.\n\n        So we stick to the average.\n\n 6. Implementation:\n\n    We'll create a table for the 24 hours (0 to 23) and compute the average for each hour.\n\n    Then, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-02 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-08-01 23:00:00)\n        End: 2016-08-05 23:00:00\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n        For each day in [2016-08-02, 2016-08-03, 2016-08-04, 2016-08-05]:\n            for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n                value = average for that hour\n\n 7. Compute the averages:\n\n    We'll extract the data by hour of day.\n\n    Let's index the data:\n\n        Day0: 2016-07-29 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day1: 2016-07-30 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day2: 2016-07-31 (index 48 to 71) -> all 0.533\n        Day3: 2016-08-01 (index 72 to 95)\n\n    For hour0 (00:00:00): \n        values = [1.812, 0.213, 0.533, 1.279] -> mean = (1.812+0.213+0.533+1.279)/4 = 3.837/4 = 0.95925\n\n    For hour1 (01:00:00):\n        values = [0.853, 0.426, 0.533, 1.457] -> (0.853+0.426+0.533+1.457)/4 = 3.269/4 = 0.81725\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 8. We must format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-02 00:00:00  [value0]\n2016-08-02 01:00:00  [value1]\n...\n2016-08-05 23:00:00  [last value]\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 9. We note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 10. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: (1.812 + 0.213 + 0.533 + 1.279) / 4 = 3.837 / 4 = 0.95925 -> 0.959\n        hour1: (0.853 + 0.426 + 0.533 + 1.457) / 4 = 3.269 / 4 = 0.81725 -> 0.817\n        hour2: (1.990 + (-0.036) + 0.533 + 0.284) / 4 = (1.990 -0.036 +0.533+0.284) = 2.771 /4 = 0.69275 -> 0.693\n        hour3: (1.457 + 0.142 + 0.533 + 0.746) /4 = (1.457+0.142+0.533+0.746)=2.878/4=0.7195 -> 0.720\n        hour4: (1.137 + (-0.320) + 0.533 + 0.284) /4 = (1.137-0.320+0.533+0.284)=1.634/4=0.4085 -> 0.409\n        hour5: (0.320 + (-0.391) + 0.533 + 0.426) /4 = (0.320-0.391+0.533+0.426)=0.888/4=0.222\n        hour6: (0.497 + (-0.249) + 0.533 + 0.817) /4 = (0.497-0.249+0.533+0.817)=1.598/4=0.3995 -> 0.400\n        hour7: (1.457 + 1.102 + 0.533 + 2.665) /4 = (1.457+1.102+0.533+2.665)=5.757/4=1.43925 -> 1.439\n        hour8: (0.675 + 0.888 + 0.533 + 1.173) /4 = (0.675+0.888+0.533+1.173)=3.269/4=0.81725 -> 0.817\n        hour9: (1.244 + 0.426 + 0.533 + 0.497) /4 = (1.244+0.426+0.533+0.497)=2.7/4=0.675\n        hour10: (0.888 + 1.279 + 0.533 + 0.711) /4 = (0.888+1.279+0.533+0.711)=3.411/4=0.85275 -> 0.853\n        hour11: (1.137 + 0.782 + 0.533 + 0.320) /4 = (1.137+0.782+0.533+0.320)=2.772/4=0.693\n        hour12: (0.533 + 0.817 + 0.533 + 0.462) /4 = (0.533+0.817+0.533+0.462)=2.345/4=0.58625 -> 0.586\n        hour13: (0.853 + 0.782 + 0.533 + 0.604) /4 = (0.853+0.782+0.533+0.604)=2.772/4=0.693\n        hour14: (0.640 + 0.640 + 0.533 + 0.569) /4 = (0.640+0.640+0.533+0.569)=2.382/4=0.5955 -> 0.596\n        hour15: (0.675 + 0.391 + 0.533 + 0.249) /4 = (0.675+0.391+0.533+0.249)=1.848/4=0.462\n        hour16: (0.853 + 0.746 + 0.533 + 0.391) /4 = (0.853+0.746+0.533+0.391)=2.523/4=0.63075 -> 0.631\n        hour17: (0.817 + 0.426 + 0.533 + 0.604) /4 = (0.817+0.426+0.533+0.604)=2.380/4=0.595\n        hour18: (0.320 + 0.284 + 0.533 + (-0.178)) /4 = (0.320+0.284+0.533-0.178)=0.959/4=0.23975 -> 0.240\n        hour19: (0.213 + 0.426 + 0.533 + 0.000) /4 = (0.213+0.426+0.533+0.000)=1.172/4=0.293\n        hour20: (-1.102 + (-0.675) + 0.533 + (-1.244)) /4 = (-1.102-0.675+0.533-1.244)= -2.488/4 = -0.622\n        hour21: (-1.528 + (-1.812) + 0.533 + (-1.031)) /4 = (-1.528-1.812+0.533-1.031)= -3.838/4 = -0.9595 -> -0.960\n        hour22: (0.178 + 0.604 + 0.533 + (-0.426)) /4 = (0.178+0.604+0.533-0.426)=0.889/4=0.22225 -> 0.222\n        hour23: (-0.071 + 1.244 + 0.533 + 1.102) /4 = (-0.071+1.244+0.533+1.102)=2.808/4=0.702\n\n    We have the 24 means.\n\n 11. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-02 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.959\n        Then 2016-08-02 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.817\n        ... until 2016-08-02 23:00:00 -> hour23: 0.702\n\n        Then 2016-08-03 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.959\n        ... and so on.\n\n 12. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 13. Note: The dates must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 14. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        last_date = datetime(2016, 8, 1, 23, 0, 0)\n        next_date = last_date + timedelta(hours=1)  # 2016-08-02 00:00:00\n\n        Then we generate 96 hours.\n\n 15. But we can do without programming: \n\n        Day1: 2016-08-02: 00:00:00 -> 0.959\n01:00:00 -> 0.817\n02:00:00 -> 0.693\n03:00:00 -> 0.720\n04:00:00 -> 0.409\n05:00:00 -> 0.222\n06:00:00 -> 0.400\n07:00:00 -> 1.439\n08:00:00 -> 0.817\n09:00:00 -> 0.675\n10:00:00 -> 0.853\n11:00:00 -> 0.693\n12:00:00 -> 0.586\n13:00:00 -> 0.693\n14:00:00 -> 0.596\n15:00:00 -> 0.462\n16:00:00 -> 0.631\n17:00:00 -> 0.595\n18:00:00 -> 0.240\n19:00:00 -> 0.293\n20:00:00 -> -0.622\n21:00:00 -> -0.960\n22:00:00 -> 0.222\n23:00:00 -> 0.702\n\n        Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 16. We write the output.\n\n 17. However, note that the problem says the data will have missing values. But in the provided 96 points we didn't have any. \n     We are generating the forecast without missing values. So we output 96 complete records.\n\n 18. We output the data in the required format.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n        We'll write 96 lines.\n\n        The first forecasted date: 2016-08-02 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-08-02 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n\n        We have the 24 means in a list: [0.959, 0.817, 0.693, 0.720, 0.409, 0.222, 0.400, 1.439, 0.817, 0.675, 0.853, 0.693, 0.586, 0.693, 0.596, 0.462, 0.631, 0.595, 0.240, 0.293, -0.622, -0.960, 0.222, 0.702]\n\n        Then for the next days, we repeat the same list.\n\n 19.
