        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours = 96).\n\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missingness in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we have consecutive hourly data without gaps. So for the next 96, we must also produce 96 consecutive hourly timestamps.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 4. Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, we should be cautious. But the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we can use a model that handles time series with potential seasonality and trends.\n\n 5. Observing the data: \n    - There is a clear daily pattern (temperature rises during the day and falls at night).\n    - There might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we will focus on daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 6. Approach:\n    - We can use a model that captures seasonality, such as SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 4 days of data, a complex model might not be robust.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n        a. Decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual.\n        b. Forecast each component.\n\n    - But note: the data on 2017-04-25 shows an unusual drop (down to 9.849 at 19:00). This might be an outlier or a special event. We must be cautious.\n\n 7. Given the constraints and the fact that we are only to provide the next 96 points (4 days) and the data is hourly, we can try to use a seasonal naive method or a moving average. However, the problem requires a forecast.\n\n 8. We choose to use a simple model: Seasonal Naive. Why?\n    - The data has a strong daily pattern. The seasonal naive method uses the value from the same time in the previous season (which is one day ago) as the forecast.\n\n    - Formula: \n        Forecast for time t (which is at hour h of day d) = value at hour h of day d-1.\n\n    - But note: we have 4 days of data. We can use the next day (the 5th day) as the same as the 4th day? \n        However, the 4th day (2017-04-26) might be different from the 3rd and 2nd? \n\n    - Alternatively, we can average the same hour over the past 4 days? But 4 days is too few for averaging.\n\n    - Another idea: use the last day (2017-04-26) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But the problem asks for 4 days of forecast (96 hours). So we can repeat the pattern of the last day for the next 4 days? \n\n    However, note that the data might have a trend? But the last 4 days do not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend overall.\n\n 9. Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n     Day1 (2017-04-27) = same as 2017-04-26 (the previous day) \n     Day2 (2017-04-28) = same as 2017-04-26? or we can use 2017-04-25? \n\n     But the problem: the data on 2017-04-25 has a drop. So if we use 2017-04-26 as the pattern, then we are ignoring the drop as an anomaly? \n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days? \n\n     Let H_h be the hour of the day (0 to 23). Then for each hour h, we have 4 values: from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n     Then the forecast for hour h of any day in the next 4 days is the average of the 4 values at hour h.\n\n     But note: the drop on 2017-04-25 might be an outlier. We can use median to be robust? \n\n 11. However, the problem says \"missing values\" but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can use the average or median.\n\n 12. Let's compute the median for each hour (to avoid the outlier on 2017-04-25):\n\n     For hour 0: \n        2017-04-23: 16.18, 2017-04-24: 17.587, 2017-04-25: 18.572, 2017-04-26: 11.678\n        sorted: 11.678, 16.18, 17.587, 18.572 -> median = (16.18+17.587)/2 = 16.8835\n\n     But wait, the drop on 2017-04-26 at hour0 is 11.678? That is also low. So we have two low values? \n\n     Actually, looking at the data, 2017-04-25 and 2017-04-26 have lower temperatures. So maybe the drop is not an outlier? \n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to provide a forecast, and the data is limited, we have to make a decision.\n\n 14. We decide to use the median for each hour of the day over the 4 available days. Why median? Because it is robust to outliers.\n\n 15. Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        Collect the 4 values for that hour from the 4 days.\n        Compute the median.\n\n     Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same: for each day, we use the 24 medians.\n\n 16. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values. So we can compute the medians.\n\n 17. However, if we use the medians, we are ignoring any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. And the next 4 days are in the same season? \n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-04-26) as the forecast for the next day, and then adjust by the difference between consecutive days? But that might be too noisy.\n\n 19. Given the instructions and the need for a complete 96 points, we will use the median method.\n\n 20. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: [16.18, 17.587, 18.572, 11.678] -> sorted: 11.678, 16.18, 17.587, 18.572 -> median = (16.18+17.587)/2 = 16.8835\n     Hour 1: [15.969, 16.883, 19.908, 11.889] -> sorted: 11.889, 15.969, 16.883, 19.908 -> median = (15.969+16.883)/2 = 16.426\n     Hour 2: [15.195, 17.376, 18.853, 11.818] -> sorted: 11.818, 15.195, 17.376, 18.853 -> median = (15.195+17.376)/2 = 16.2855\n     Hour 3: [15.687, 15.265, 17.868, 11.678] -> sorted: 11.678, 15.265, 15.687, 17.868 -> median = (15.265+15.687)/2 = 15.476\n     Hour 4: [15.617, 15.054, 18.009, 12.240] -> sorted: 12.240, 15.054, 15.617, 18.009 -> median = (15.054+15.617)/2 = 15.3355\n     Hour 5: [15.195, 14.421, 18.009, 12.451] -> sorted: 12.451, 14.421, 15.195, 18.009 -> median = (14.421+15.195)/2 = 14.808\n     Hour 6: [15.125, 14.773, 17.516, 13.436] -> sorted: 13.436, 14.773, 15.125, 17.516 -> median = (14.773+15.125)/2 = 14.949\n     Hour 7: [16.602, 15.898, 16.883, 11.959] -> sorted: 11.959, 15.898, 16.602, 16.883 -> median = (15.898+16.602)/2 = 16.25\n     Hour 8: [18.572, 16.743, 17.657, 11.678] -> sorted: 11.678, 16.743, 17.657, 18.572 -> median = (16.743+17.657)/2 = 17.2\n     Hour 9: [17.446, 17.376, 17.798, 11.678] -> sorted: 11.678, 17.376, 17.446, 17.798 -> median = (17.376+17.446)/2 = 17.411\n     Hour 10: [18.29, 18.853, 17.798, 12.240] -> sorted: 12.240, 17.798, 18.29, 18.853 -> median = (17.798+18.29)/2 = 18.044\n     Hour 11: [18.853, 19.275, 18.853, 13.225] -> sorted: 13.225, 18.853, 18.853, 19.275 -> median = (18.853+18.853)/2 = 18.853\n     Hour 12: [19.627, 19.697, 18.642, 14.351] -> sorted: 14.351, 18.642, 19.627, 19.697 -> median = (18.642+19.627)/2 = 19.1345\n     Hour 13: [19.697, 20.471, 18.572, 14.843] -> sorted: 14.843, 18.572, 19.697, 20.471 -> median = (18.572+19.697)/2 = 19.1345\n     Hour 14: [21.526, 22.581, 17.024, 14.703] -> sorted: 14.703, 17.024, 21.526, 22.581 -> median = (17.024+21.526)/2 = 19.275\n     Hour 15: [22.441, 23.074, 16.743, 14.421] -> sorted: 14.421, 16.743, 22.441, 23.074 -> median = (16.743+22.441)/2 = 19.592\n     Hour 16: [23.777, 25.114, 18.572, 14.703] -> sorted: 14.703, 18.572, 23.777, 25.114 -> median = (18.572+23.777)/2 = 21.1745\n     Hour 17: [23.355, 24.903, 16.109, 14.210] -> sorted: 14.210, 16.109, 23.355, 24.903 -> median = (16.109+23.355)/2 = 19.732\n     Hour 18: [22.933, 23.144, 14.632, 13.647] -> sorted: 13.647, 14.632, 22.933, 23.144 -> median = (14.632+22.933)/2 = 18.7825\n     Hour 19: [20.541, 22.230, 9.849, 13.647] -> sorted: 9.849, 13.647, 20.541, 22.230 -> median = (13.647+20.541)/2 = 17.094\n     Hour 20: [19.064, 20.682, 9.778, 12.944] -> sorted: 9.778, 12.944, 19.064, 20.682 -> median = (12.944+19.064)/2 = 16.004\n     Hour 21: [18.079, 20.190, 11.467, 12.311] -> sorted: 11.467, 12.311, 18.079, 20.190 -> median = (12.311+18.079)/2 = 15.195\n     Hour 22: [17.446, 20.682, 10.622, 12.311] -> sorted: 10.622, 12.311, 17.446, 20.682 -> median = (12.311+17.446)/2 = 14.8785\n     Hour 23: [17.305, 18.712, 8.231, 12.662] -> sorted: 8.231, 12.662, 17.305, 18.712 -> median = (12.662+17.305)/2 = 14.9835\n\n 21. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the same 24 medians for each day.\n\n     Dates: \n        Day 1: 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-27 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-04-28 00:00:00 to 2017-04-28 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-04-29 00:00:00 to 2017-04-29 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-04-30 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00\n\n 22. We must generate the timestamps and the corresponding median value for the hour.\n\n 23. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-27 00:00:00 16.8835\n2017-04-27 01:00:00 16.426\n2017-04-27 02:00:00 16.2855\n... for all 96 points\n\n```\n\n 24. But note: the original data has 3 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimal places to match.\n\n 25. However, the median we computed might have more decimals. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. Let's recalculate the medians and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n     Hour0: 16.8835 -> 16.884\n     Hour1: 16.426 -> 16.426\n     Hour2: 16.2855 -> 16.286\n     Hour3: 15.476 -> 15.476\n     Hour4: 15.3355 -> 15.336\n     Hour5: 14.808 -> 14.808\n     Hour6: 14.949 -> 14.949\n     Hour7: 16.25 -> 16.250\n     Hour8: 17.2 -> 17.200\n     Hour9: 17.411 -> 17.411\n     Hour10: 18.044 -> 18.044\n     Hour11: 18.853 -> 18.853\n     Hour12: 19.1345 -> 19.135\n     Hour13: 19.1345 -> 19.135\n     Hour14: 19.275 -> 19.275\n     Hour15: 19.592 -> 19.592\n     Hour16: 21.1745 -> 21.175\n     Hour17: 19.732 -> 19.732\n     Hour18: 18.7825 -> 18.783\n     Hour19: 17.094 -> 17.094\n     Hour20: 16.004 -> 16.004\n     Hour21: 15.195 -> 15.195\n     Hour22: 14.8785 -> 14.879\n     Hour23: 14.9835 -> 14.984\n\n 27. Now, we write the next 4 days with these 24 values repeated.\n\n 28. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, we are generating a complete forecast. We are not given any information about missingness in the future, so we assume we are to produce 96 consecutive points.\n\n 29. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n     Start: 2017-04-27 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-04-26 23:00:00)\n     Then 2017-04-27 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-30 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll generate:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-27 00:00:00 -> hour0: 16.884\n        Day1: 2017-04-27 01:00:00 -> hour1: 16.426\n        ... \n        Day1: 2017-04-27 23:00:00 -> hour23: 14.984\n\n        Day2: 2017-04-28 00:00:00 -> hour0: 16.884\n        ... and so on.\n\n 31. We write 96 lines.\n\n 32. We output in the required format.\n\n 33. Note: The original data has some values with 3 decimal places and some with 6? But we see the data is given with 3 or 6? Actually, the data provided has 3 decimal places for most, but sometimes 6? \n        Example: 16.180000 -> we can output 3 decimals.\n\n     We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. Let's code the output:\n\n     We can create a list of the 24 medians (rounded to 3 decimals) and then repeat 4 times.\n\n 35. The medians list (for hours 0 to 23) in order:\n\n        [16.884, 16.426, 16.286, 15.476, 15.336, 14.808, 14.949, 16.250, 17.200, 17.411, 18.044, 18.853, 19.135, 19.135, 19.275, 19.592, 21.175, 19.732, 18.783, 17.094, 16.004, 15.195, 14.879, 14.984]\n\n 36. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2017,4,27,0,0,0)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = start.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                value = medians[hour]\n                print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")\n                start += timedelta(hours=1)\n\n 37. But we are writing the answer in the required format.\n\n 38. We write the answer in the markdown code block.\n\n 39. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast. We are not given any information about missingness in the future, so we assume we are to produce 96 consecutive points.\n\n 40. We output the 96 points.\n\n 41. Let's do it.\n",
