        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious in our forecasting method to handle potential non-stationarity, seasonality, and trends.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 time steps (which is 4 days) and the data shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations within a day), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, as an AI, I cannot run code but I can use a suitable time series forecasting technique. Given the constraints, I will use a simple but effective method: \n   - We can use an autoregressive model with seasonal components. But without the ability to run code, we have to rely on a heuristic.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n   - Since the data has a daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use the last 24 hours as a base and adjust with a trend.\n\n But note: the data we have is only 4 days (96 hours). We can compute the average day from the 4 days and then project that forward? However, there might be a trend.\n\n Let's check the overall trend in the 4 days:\n   - The temperatures on 2016-11-22 start at 13.999 and end at 1.337 (a decrease? but then fluctuates).\n   - Actually, the data does not show a clear linear trend. It goes up and down.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour of the day and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a flat seasonal pattern.\n\n However, we note that the last day (2016-11-25) has higher temperatures than the first day? Let's compare:\n\n  2016-11-22 00:00:00 -> 13.999\n  2016-11-23 00:00:00 -> 0.844\n  2016-11-24 00:00:00 -> 2.532\n  2016-11-25 00:00:00 -> 7.246\n\n This is volatile. Instead, we can use a moving average of the last 24 hours and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? \n\n Given the complexity and without running a model, we can use a simple method:\n\n   Forecast for hour h of day d (where d=5,6,7,8 for the next 4 days) is the average of the same hour in the past 4 days.\n\n But note: we have exactly 4 days of data. So for a given hour (say 00:00), we have 4 values: \n   day1: 13.999, day2: 0.844, day3: 2.532, day4: 7.246 -> average = (13.999+0.844+2.532+7.246)/4 = 6.15525\n\n Then we do this for each hour (0 to 23) and repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-25) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? \n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can use the 4 days.\n\n Since the requirement is to provide the next 96 points, we can generate the next 4 days by taking the average of the same hour across the 4 available days.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) in the day:\n        forecast_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern.\n\n However, let's check if there is a trend? We can compute the overall average for each day:\n\n   Day1 (2016-11-22): average = (13.999+11.326+...+1.337)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n        but from the data, it starts at 14 and ends at 1.3, and has low values during the day? \n\n   Instead, we can use the average of the same hour for the 4 days and then add a drift? But without a clear trend, we avoid.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we will use the average by hour.\n\n How to compute:\n\n   We have 24 hours in a day and 4 days of data.\n\n   We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and take the average.\n\n   Then, the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all weekdays? 22nd to 25th are Tuesday to Friday). We don't have weekend data. So we cannot account for weekly seasonality.\n\n Therefore, we use the 4-day average for each hour.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (13.999, 0.844, 2.532, 7.246) -> (13.999+0.844+2.532+7.246)/4 = 24.621/4 = 6.15525\n   Hour 1: (11.326, 3.095, 2.884, 6.331) -> (11.326+3.095+2.884+6.331)/4 = 23.636/4 = 5.909\n   ... and so on.\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, the forecast for:\n   2016-11-26 00:00:00 -> 0: 6.155\n   2016-11-26 01:00:00 -> 1: 5.909\n   ... until 2016-11-26 23:00:00 -> 23: [average for hour 23]\n\n Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n However, note that the last day (2016-11-25) had a higher average? We might want to use a weighted average? But without more data, we stick to simple average.\n\n But let's consider: if we see a trend of increasing temperatures? The last day (2016-11-25) has the highest values in the 4 days? Then we might want to use only the last day? \n\n However, the problem says we must forecast 96 points. We have to use a method that is consistent.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide the data, we choose the average method.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-25) as the forecast? But that would be 2016-11-26 same as 2016-11-25, 2016-11-27 same as 2016-11-24? That doesn't make sense.\n\n Given the above, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: [13.999, 0.844, 2.532, 7.246] -> 6.15525\n   Hour 1: [11.326, 3.095, 2.884, 6.331] -> (11.326+3.095+2.884+6.331)=23.636 -> 5.909\n   Hour 2: [12.733, 4.924, 4.643, 5.979] -> (12.733+4.924+4.643+5.979)=28.279 -> 7.06975\n   Hour 3: [11.467, 2.955, 4.291, 5.698] -> (11.467+2.955+4.291+5.698)=24.411 -> 6.10275\n   Hour 4: [9.778, 2.814, 3.869, 6.472] -> (9.778+2.814+3.869+6.472)=22.933 -> 5.73325\n   Hour 5: [8.864, 3.799, 4.150, 7.246] -> (8.864+3.799+4.150+7.246)=24.059 -> 6.01475\n   Hour 6: [4.362, 4.080, 3.095, 6.824] -> (4.362+4.080+3.095+6.824)=18.361 -> 4.59025\n   Hour 7: [5.206, 4.291, 3.166, 6.120] -> (5.206+4.291+3.166+6.120)=18.783 -> 4.69575\n   Hour 8: [4.713, 4.221, 4.995, 5.346] -> (4.713+4.221+4.995+5.346)=19.275 -> 4.81875\n   Hour 9: [6.120, 4.713, 5.768, 5.979] -> (6.120+4.713+5.768+5.979)=22.58 -> 5.645\n   Hour 10: [4.924, 3.939, 5.979, 6.050] -> (4.924+3.939+5.979+6.050)=20.892 -> 5.223\n   Hour 11: [4.854, 2.603, 7.809, 7.105] -> (4.854+2.603+7.809+7.105)=22.371 -> 5.59275\n   Hour 12: [5.135, 1.266, 7.246, 7.246] -> (5.135+1.266+7.246+7.246)=20.893 -> 5.22325\n   Hour 13: [6.261, 1.407, 7.738, 6.964] -> (6.261+1.407+7.738+6.964)=22.37 -> 5.5925\n   Hour 14: [6.402, 2.532, 8.442, 7.668] -> (6.402+2.532+8.442+7.668)=25.044 -> 6.261\n   Hour 15: [5.557, 2.181, 7.316, 7.949] -> (5.557+2.181+7.316+7.949)=23.003 -> 5.75075\n   Hour 16: [4.150, 2.532, 6.683, 8.231] -> (4.150+2.532+6.683+8.231)=21.596 -> 5.399\n   Hour 17: [1.970, 4.643, 7.035, 8.934] -> (1.970+4.643+7.035+8.934)=22.582 -> 5.6455\n   Hour 18: [3.095, 1.337, 7.809, 9.638] -> (3.095+1.337+7.809+9.638)=21.879 -> 5.46975\n   Hour 19: [2.673, 1.970, 8.231, 8.934] -> (2.673+1.970+8.231+8.934)=21.808 -> 5.452\n   Hour 20: [2.110, 1.688, 7.457, 8.160] -> (2.110+1.688+7.457+8.160)=19.415 -> 4.85375\n   Hour 21: [0.633, 4.713, 9.075, 8.020] -> (0.633+4.713+9.075+8.020)=22.441 -> 5.61025\n   Hour 22: [2.110, 2.955, 8.582, 8.090] -> (2.110+2.955+8.582+8.090)=21.737 -> 5.43425\n   Hour 23: [1.337, 3.166, 7.105, 9.215] -> (1.337+3.166+7.105+9.215)=20.823 -> 5.20575\n\n Then, the next 4 days (2016-11-26 to 2016-11-29) will have:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-11-26): [6.155, 5.909, 7.070, 6.103, 5.733, 6.015, 4.590, 4.696, 4.819, 5.645, 5.223, 5.593, 5.223, 5.593, 6.261, 5.751, 5.399, 5.646, 5.470, 5.452, 4.854, 5.610, 5.434, 5.206]\n   Day 2 (2016-11-27): same 24 numbers\n   Day 3 (2016-11-28): same\n   Day 4 (2016-11-29): same\n\n But note: the dates must be generated as:\n\n   2016-11-26 00:00:00, 2016-11-26 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-29 23:00:00.\n\n However, we must format the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But wait: the input has 3 decimal places? Actually, the input has 3 decimal places for all.\n\n We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's recalculate and round:\n\n   Hour 0: 6.15525 -> 6.155\n   Hour 1: 5.909 -> 5.909\n   Hour 2: 7.06975 -> 7.070\n   Hour 3: 6.10275 -> 6.103\n   Hour 4: 5.73325 -> 5.733\n   Hour 5: 6.01475 -> 6.015\n   Hour 6: 4.59025 -> 4.590\n   Hour 7: 4.69575 -> 4.696\n   Hour 8: 4.81875 -> 4.819\n   Hour 9: 5.645 -> 5.645\n   Hour 10: 5.223 -> 5.223\n   Hour 11: 5.59275 -> 5.593\n   Hour 12: 5.22325 -> 5.223\n   Hour 13: 5.5925 -> 5.593\n   Hour 14: 6.261 -> 6.261\n   Hour 15: 5.75075 -> 5.751\n   Hour 16: 5.399 -> 5.399\n   Hour 17: 5.6455 -> 5.646\n   Hour 18: 5.46975 -> 5.470\n   Hour 19: 5.452 -> 5.452\n   Hour 20: 4.85375 -> 4.854\n   Hour 21: 5.61025 -> 5.610\n   Hour 22: 5.43425 -> 5.434\n   Hour 23: 5.20575 -> 5.206\n\n So the 24-hour pattern is:\n\n   00: 6.155\n   01: 5.909\n   02: 7.070\n   03: 6.103\n   04: 5.733\n   05: 6.015\n   06: 4.590\n   07: 4.696\n   08: 4.819\n   09: 5.645\n   10: 5.223\n   11: 5.593\n   12: 5.223\n   13: 5.593\n   14: 6.261\n   15: 5.751\n   16: 5.399\n   17: 5.646\n   18: 5.470\n   19: 5.452\n   20: 4.854\n   21: 5.610\n   22: 5.434\n   23: 5.206\n\n We will generate 4 days of this pattern.\n\n But note: the starting date for the forecast is the next hour after 2016-11-25 23:00:00, which is 2016-11-26 00:00:00.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2016-11-26 00:00:00 is 6.155, and so on.\n\n We write the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n Format: \n   <answer>\n        date                  OT\n        2016-11-26 00:00:00  6.155\n        2016-11-26 01:00:00  5.909\n        ... \n        2016-11-29 23:00:00  5.206\n\n But note: we must output exactly 96 records.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-26 00:00:00\n   End:   2016-11-29 23:00:00\n\n How many? 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n We'll output the 24 numbers for the first day (2016-11-26), then the same 24 for 2016-11-27, then 2016-11-28, then 2016-11-29.\n\n However, note: the pattern is the same for each day?
