        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values.\n    However, the provided sample for the past 96 points is complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have complete data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast the next 96 hours, we note that the data might have daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96 points forecast, \n    we can use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, or a more sophisticated one like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS). However, without more context, \n    we choose a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the data, we observe:\n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (values during the day and night).\n    - The data has both positive and negative values.\n\n 6. We will use a Seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) because it can capture both the autoregressive, moving average, and seasonal components.\n\n 7. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We have seasonality of 24 hours (so seasonal period s=24).\n    - We need to determine the non-seasonal (p,d,q) and seasonal (P,D,Q) parameters.\n\n 8. However, note that we only have 4 days (96 points) which is very limited data for fitting a SARIMA model with 24-hour seasonality. \n    We might consider a simpler model.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a rolling forecast method, but we are required to forecast 96 points.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we can try to use a naive seasonal model: \n     - The forecast for each hour in the next day is the same as the same hour in the previous day(s). \n     - But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n 11. However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the last day (2017-08-04) vs the first day (2017-08-01). \n     The values on 2017-08-04 are generally lower or higher? It's not clear. We can try to compute the average for each hour.\n\n 12. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours across the 4 days.\n\n 13. But note: the data provided is exactly 4 days (96 hours). So we can group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and take the mean.\n\n 14. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same as the average of the same hour for the past 4 days.\n\n 15. However, let's check if there is a trend? We don't have enough data to model a trend over 4 days. So we ignore trend and use the average.\n\n 16. Steps:\n     - Group the 96 hours into 4 groups of 24 hours (each day).\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n     - Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is the same 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 17. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data (only 4 days, all in the same week?).\n\n 18. Since we don't have information about the day of the week, and the data is only 4 days, we assume that the pattern is daily.\n\n 19. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 00: (1.031 + (-0.213) + 1.244 + 0.284) / 4 = (1.031 -0.213 + 1.244 + 0.284) = 2.346 / 4 = 0.5865\n     Hour 01: (0.284 + (-0.355) + 0.746 + (-0.249)) / 4 = (0.284 -0.355 + 0.746 -0.249) = 0.426 / 4 = 0.1065\n     ... and so on.\n\n 20. Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) we assign:\n       2017-08-05 00:00:00: 0.5865\n       2017-08-05 01:00:00: 0.1065\n       ... and then repeat the same 24-hour pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 21. However, note that the data might have non-stationary behavior? But with only 4 days, we cannot model long-term trends.\n\n 22. This method is simple and leverages the daily seasonality.\n\n 23. But what if there is a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a trend beyond 4 days. So we assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-04) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be less robust.\n\n 25. We choose the average method.\n\n 26. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 days.\n\n     Hour 0: [1.031, -0.213, 1.244, 0.284] -> mean = (1.031 -0.213 + 1.244 + 0.284)/4 = (2.346)/4 = 0.5865\n     Hour 1: [0.284, -0.355, 0.746, -0.249] -> (0.284 -0.355 + 0.746 -0.249) = 0.426/4 = 0.1065\n     Hour 2: [0.355, -0.320, 0.711, 0.426] -> (0.355 -0.320 + 0.711 + 0.426) = 1.172/4 = 0.293\n     Hour 3: [-0.107, -0.959, -0.036, 0.107] -> (-0.107 -0.959 -0.036 + 0.107) = -0.995/4 = -0.24875\n     Hour 4: [-0.107, -0.533, 0.604, 0.142] -> (-0.107 -0.533 + 0.604 + 0.142) = 0.106/4 = 0.0265\n     Hour 5: [-0.249, -1.421, 0.391, -0.178] -> (-0.249 -1.421 + 0.391 -0.178) = -1.457/4 = -0.36425\n     Hour 6: [-1.315, -1.208, 0.355, 0.249] -> (-1.315 -1.208 + 0.355 + 0.249) = -1.919/4 = -0.47975\n     Hour 7: [-0.071, 0.249, 0.746, 0.604] -> (-0.071 + 0.249 + 0.746 + 0.604) = 1.528/4 = 0.382\n     Hour 8: [0.178, -0.497, 0.036, 0.746] -> (0.178 -0.497 + 0.036 + 0.746) = 0.463/4 = 0.11575\n     Hour 9: [0.071, -0.533, -0.071, 1.031] -> (0.071 -0.533 -0.071 + 1.031) = 0.498/4 = 0.1245\n     Hour 10: [0.036, 0.000, 0.249, 2.274] -> (0.036 + 0.000 + 0.249 + 2.274) = 2.559/4 = 0.63975\n     Hour 11: [0.959, -0.320, 0.675, 2.630] -> (0.959 -0.320 + 0.675 + 2.630) = 3.944/4 = 0.986\n     Hour 12: [1.990, -0.924, 0.249, 1.457] -> (1.990 -0.924 + 0.249 + 1.457) = 2.772/4 = 0.693\n     Hour 13: [2.487, -1.066, 3.163, 0.249] -> (2.487 -1.066 + 3.163 + 0.249) = 4.833/4 = 1.20825\n     Hour 14: [0.142, -1.066, 2.452, 1.564] -> (0.142 -1.066 + 2.452 + 1.564) = 3.092/4 = 0.773\n     Hour 15: [-0.107, -0.320, 1.279, -0.640] -> (-0.107 -0.320 + 1.279 -0.640) = 0.212/4 = 0.053\n     Hour 16: [-0.320, -1.066, -0.284, 0.675] -> (-0.320 -1.066 -0.284 + 0.675) = -0.995/4 = -0.24875\n     Hour 17: [-0.320, -0.995, -0.959, -0.071] -> (-0.320 -0.995 -0.959 -0.071) = -2.345/4 = -0.58625\n     Hour 18: [-1.173, -1.599, -1.350, -0.746] -> (-1.173 -1.599 -1.350 -0.746) = -4.868/4 = -1.217\n     Hour 19: [-1.102, -2.132, -1.564, -0.853] -> (-1.102 -2.132 -1.564 -0.853) = -5.651/4 = -1.41275\n     Hour 20: [-1.421, -1.812, -1.137, -0.675] -> (-1.421 -1.812 -1.137 -0.675) = -5.045/4 = -1.26125\n     Hour 21: [-1.706, -2.594, -1.492, -0.746] -> (-1.706 -2.594 -1.492 -0.746) = -6.538/4 = -1.6345\n     Hour 22: [-0.959, -0.995, -1.670, -0.782] -> (-0.959 -0.995 -1.670 -0.782) = -4.406/4 = -1.1015\n     Hour 23: [-0.995, 0.071, -0.604, 0.178] -> (-0.995 + 0.071 -0.604 + 0.178) = -1.35/4 = -0.3375\n\n 27. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the above 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 28. The dates for the next 96 hours start from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 and go hourly until 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We output the data in the same format.\n\n 30. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Let's create the forecast:\n\n     Day 1 (2017-08-05):\n        00:00:00 -> 0.5865 -> 0.587 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        01:00:00 -> 0.1065 -> 0.107\n        02:00:00 -> 0.293 -> 0.293\n        03:00:00 -> -0.24875 -> -0.249\n        04:00:00 -> 0.0265 -> 0.027\n        05:00:00 -> -0.36425 -> -0.364\n        06:00:00 -> -0.47975 -> -0.480\n        07:00:00 -> 0.382 -> 0.382\n        08:00:00 -> 0.11575 -> 0.116\n        09:00:00 -> 0.1245 -> 0.125\n        10:00:00 -> 0.63975 -> 0.640\n        11:00:00 -> 0.986 -> 0.986\n        12:00:00 -> 0.693 -> 0.693\n        13:00:00 -> 1.20825 -> 1.208\n        14:00:00 -> 0.773 -> 0.773\n        15:00:00 -> 0.053 -> 0.053\n        16:00:00 -> -0.24875 -> -0.249\n        17:00:00 -> -0.58625 -> -0.586\n        18:00:00 -> -1.217 -> -1.217\n        19:00:00 -> -1.41275 -> -1.413\n        20:00:00 -> -1.26125 -> -1.261\n        21:00:00 -> -1.6345 -> -1.635\n        22:00:00 -> -1.1015 -> -1.102\n        23:00:00 -> -0.3375 -> -0.338\n\n     Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 32. We write the dates accordingly.\n\n 33. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 34. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-05 00:00:00  0.587\n2017-08-05 01:00:00  0.107\n2017-08-05 02:00:00  0.293\n2017-08-05 03:00:00 -0.249\n... until 2017-08-08 23:00:00\n\n```\n\n 35. We note that this is a simple average method. In practice, more sophisticated models might be used, but with only 4 days of data, \n     it's challenging to fit a complex model.\n\n 36. We output the data as required.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n We have the 24-hour pattern as a list:\n\n pattern = [0.5865, 0.1065, 0.293, -0.24875, 0.0265, -0.36425, -0.47975, 0.382, 0.11575, 0.1245, 0.63975, 0.986, 0.693, 1.20825, 0.773, 0.053, -0.24875, -0.58625, -1.217, -1.41275, -1.26125, -1.6345, -1.1015, -0.3375]\n\n Then we repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: we must round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's create the list of values:\n\n values = [round(x, 3) for x in pattern] * 4\n\n However, we computed the pattern value and then we round. But note that the rounding should be done after the average.\n\n Alternatively, we can round each value in the pattern to 3 decimals.\n\n We'll do:\n\n pattern_rounded = [round(0.5865,3) -> 0.587, round(0.1065,3) -> 0.107, ...]\n\n We already computed the rounded values for the first day above.\n\n We'll create the pattern_rounded list:\n\n pattern_rounded = [\n    0.587, 0.107, 0.293, -0.249, 0.027, -0.364, -0.480, 0.382, \n    0.116, 0.125, 0.640, 0.986, 0.693, 1.208, 0.773, 0.053, \n    -0.249, -0.586, -1.217, -1.413, -1.261, -1.635, -1.102, -0.338\n ]\n\n Then we repeat this 4 times.\n\n 37. Now, generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-08-05 00:00:00\n     End:   2017-08-08 23:00:00\n\n     We can generate 96 dates by starting from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 and adding 1 hour each time.\n\n 38.
