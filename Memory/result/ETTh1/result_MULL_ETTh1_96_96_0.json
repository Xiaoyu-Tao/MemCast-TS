        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-01 00:00:00 to 2016-07-04 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might be strong?).\n 2. We have to handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points we don't see any. So we assume the provided history is complete? But we must be cautious for the future.\n\n However, the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and we are to forecast the next 96. The provided data is 96 points without gaps? Let's check:\n   From 2016-07-01 00:00:00 to 2016-07-04 23:00:00: \n       4 days * 24 hours = 96 points. So it's complete.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (4 days: 2016-07-05 to 2016-07-08).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data has hourly frequency, we can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any, but in 4 days it might be minimal)\n   - Seasonality (daily: 24 hours, and possibly weekly: 168 hours, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not available)\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - Daily peaks and troughs.\n\n We can use a seasonal model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the same pattern as the previous day? But we have 4 days, so we can average the pattern? \n   - Or use a model like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality) or SARIMA.\n\n But note: the data has a non-constant pattern. Also, the values on the first day (July 1) are lower than the subsequent days? \n   July 1: max around 1.35, July 2: max around 3.3, July 3: max around 3.12, July 4: max around 3.48.\n\n So there is an increasing trend? But then July 3 and 4 are not consistently increasing? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n   - Take the last day (July 4) and use it as the base, and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided history we don't have any. For forecasting, we are to produce 96 points without missing? \n\n Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points, we must generate 96 values.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use a simple average of the last two days (July 3 and 4) for the daily pattern? But note that July 2 is a Saturday and July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday? (But 2016-07-01 is Friday, 2016-07-02 Saturday, 2016-07-03 Sunday, 2016-07-04 Monday). \n\n We are forecasting for Tuesday (2016-07-05) to Friday (2016-07-08). \n\n We can use:\n   - The same pattern as the previous Monday (July 4) for Tuesday? But that might not be accurate.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But note the increasing trend? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the model. We are to be an expert.\n\n Considering simplicity and the fact that we have only 96 points, we can use a seasonal naive model that uses the last day (July 4) as the pattern for July 5, then July 5 for July 6? But that would be the same as July 4 for all? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the past 4 days? \n\n Let me try:\n\n   For hour 00:00: we have [0.462, 1.315, 2.310, 2.630] -> average = (0.462+1.315+2.310+2.630)/4 = 1.67925\n   For hour 01:00: [0.426, 1.350, 2.843, 2.665] -> (0.426+1.350+2.843+2.665)/4 = 1.821\n\n But then we lose the trend? The last two days are higher.\n\n We can also use a weighted average? More weight to recent days? \n\n However, note that the problem does not require a sophisticated model. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (July 4) and adjust by the average daily growth? \n\n But the daily growth is not linear. \n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average method with seasonality. \n\n Given the time, I propose to use the average of the last two days (July 3 and 4) for each hour to form the base pattern, and then for the next 4 days, we use that pattern. But note that the pattern might change? \n\n However, we have to produce 96 points. \n\n Steps for the forecast:\n\n   We have 4 days: D1 (2016-07-01), D2 (2016-07-02), D3 (2016-07-03), D4 (2016-07-04)\n\n   We are to forecast D5 (2016-07-05), D6 (2016-07-06), D7 (2016-07-07), D8 (2016-07-08)\n\n   For each hour h in [0,23]:\n        value(D5, h) = (value(D3, h) + value(D4, h)) / 2   [average of Sunday and Monday?]\n\n   But then for D6: we don't use D5? We can do:\n\n        D5: average of D3 and D4\n        D6: average of D4 and D5? -> but that would be (D4 + (D3+D4)/2)/2 = (D3/4 + 3*D4/4) -> more weight to D4.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same pattern for D5, D6, D7, D8? That is, use the average of D3 and D4 for each hour for all the next 4 days? \n\n   But that would be too flat? \n\n   Or we can use a linear extrapolation? \n\n   However, the problem says the data may have missing values? But in the forecast we are to provide complete data.\n\n   Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a clear trend, I will use:\n\n        For each hour h, the forecast for the next 4 days (D5, D6, D7, D8) will be the average of the same hour for the last two days (D3 and D4).\n\n   Why last two? Because they are the most recent and might capture the current level.\n\n   But note: D3 (Sunday) and D4 (Monday) are different. We are forecasting Tuesday to Friday? So we can take the average of Monday and Sunday? \n\n   Alternatively, we can take the average of the same day of the week? But we don't have multiple Mondays or Tuesdays? \n\n   Since we have one Sunday and one Monday, and we are forecasting Tuesday, we don't have a Tuesday in the past? \n\n   So I will use the average of the last two days (D3 and D4) for each hour to form the base pattern and then use that pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   This means:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the day:\n            base_h = (D3_h + D4_h) / 2\n\n        Then for D5 (Tuesday), D6 (Wednesday), D7 (Thursday), D8 (Friday): \n            each hour h: value = base_h\n\n   But that would be the same pattern repeated for 4 days? \n\n   However, we don't have information to differentiate between weekdays? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of all 4 days for each hour? \n\n   base_h = (D1_h + D2_h + D3_h + D4_h) / 4\n\n   Then use that base pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n   But note: D1 (Friday) and D2 (Saturday) are different from Sunday and Monday? \n\n   We can try to see the pattern:\n\n        Hour 0: \n            D1: 0.462, D2: 1.315, D3: 2.310, D4: 2.630 -> average = 1.67925\n        Hour 1:\n            D1: 0.426, D2: 1.350, D3: 2.843, D4: 2.665 -> 1.821\n\n   But then we are ignoring the trend? The values are increasing? \n\n   We can also do a linear regression for each hour? But with 4 points? \n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, I choose the average of the last two days (D3 and D4) as the base pattern for the next days.\n\n   Why? Because the last two days are more recent and might reflect the current level of the transformer.\n\n   So:\n\n        base_h = (value at hour h on D3 + value at hour h on D4) / 2, for h in 0..23.\n\n        Then for each day in the next 4 days (D5, D6, D7, D8) and for each hour h, we set the forecast to base_h.\n\n   This will give us 24 * 4 = 96 points.\n\n   But note: the data on D3 and D4 are:\n\n        D3: 2016-07-03 (Sunday) -> 24 values\n        D4: 2016-07-04 (Monday) -> 24 values\n\n   We compute:\n\n        h0: (2.310 + 2.630) / 2 = 2.47\n        h1: (2.843 + 2.665) / 2 = 2.754\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for D5 (2016-07-05) 00:00:00 -> 2.47\n            01:00:00 -> 2.754\n            ... and then the same pattern for D6, D7, D8.\n\n   However, this ignores any trend? But we don't have enough data to model a trend? \n\n   Alternatively, we can add a small drift? \n\n   The average increase per day? \n\n        From D1 to D2: total increase? (average of D2 - average of D1) -> but we don't have the same pattern? \n\n   We can compute the average of each day:\n\n        D1: average = (0.462+0.426+...+1.137)/24 -> we can compute but it's time-consuming.\n\n   Instead, we can compute the average of the entire 4 days? \n\n        total average D1: 0.462,0.426,...,1.137 -> let's not compute by hand.\n\n   Given the time, I will stick to the base pattern of the last two days without drift.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data may have missing values? We are not given any in the history, and for the forecast we are to provide complete data. So we don't have to worry about missing in the forecast? \n\n   We are to generate 96 points without missing.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n        Step 1: Extract the data for D3 (2016-07-03) and D4 (2016-07-04) for each hour (24 hours each).\n        Step 2: For each hour of the day (0 to 23), compute the average of the value from D3 and D4.\n        Step 3: Repeat this 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days (so 4 times).\n\n   Example for the first hour (00:00:00) of the day:\n\n        D3: 2016-07-03 00:00:00 -> 2.310\n        D4: 2016-07-04 00:00:00 -> 2.630\n        base_00 = (2.310 + 2.630) / 2 = 2.47\n\n        Then for:\n            2016-07-05 00:00:00: 2.47\n            2016-07-06 00:00:00: 2.47\n            2016-07-07 00:00:00: 2.47\n            2016-07-08 00:00:00: 2.47\n\n   Similarly for other hours.\n\n   We'll generate the timestamps from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00.\n\n   Note: the last given data is 2016-07-04 23:00:00 -> 3.482\n\n   For hour 23: \n        D3: 2016-07-03 23:00:00 -> 3.056\n        D4: 2016-07-04 23:00:00 -> 3.482\n        base_23 = (3.056+3.482)/2 = 3.269\n\n   Then the forecast for 2016-07-05 23:00:00: 3.269, and same for 6th,7th,8th.\n\n   But note: the data on D4 (Monday) is higher than D3 (Sunday) for hour 23? So the average is in between.\n\n   This method is simple and captures the recent daily pattern.\n\n   Let's code the base pattern:\n\n        hour0: (2.310 + 2.630)/2 = 2.47\n        hour1: (2.843 + 2.665)/2 = 2.754\n        hour2: (2.203 + 2.594)/2 = 2.3985\n        hour3: (1.990 + 2.381)/2 = 2.1855\n        hour4: (2.807 + 2.523)/2 = 2.665\n        hour5: (2.452 + 2.949)/2 = 2.7005\n        hour6: (2.203 + 2.807)/2 = 2.505\n        hour7: (2.843 + 2.985)/2 = 2.914\n        hour8: (2.025 + 2.914)/2 = 2.4695\n        hour9: (1.670 + 3.056)/2 = 2.363\n        hour10: (2.559 + 3.056)/2 = 2.8075\n        hour11: (2.487 + 3.234)/2 = 2.8605\n        hour12: (2.559 + 2.630)/2 = 2.5945\n        hour13: (2.630 + 3.020)/2 = 2.825\n        hour14: (3.020 + 3.376)/2 = 3.198\n        hour15: (2.665 + 3.020)/2 = 2.8425\n        hour16: (2.985 + 2.559)/2 = 2.772\n        hour17: (2.914 + 2.452)/2 = 2.683\n        hour18: (2.523 + 2.452)/2 = 2.4875\n        hour19: (2.487 + 2.239)/2 = 2.363\n        hour20: (2.345 + 2.239)/2 = 2.292\n        hour21: (2.310 + 2.310)/2 = 2.31\n        # Correction: for hour21, D4: 2016-07-04 21:00:00 -> 2.310? \n        # But in the data: \n        #   2016-07-03 21:00:00: 2.310\n        #   2016-07-04 21:00:00: 2.310 -> so 2.31\n        hour22: (3.127 + 1.919)/2 = 2.523\n        hour23: (3.056 + 3.482)/2 = 3.269\n\n   Then we repeat this 24 numbers for 4 days.\n\n   But note: the hour22 on D4 is 1.919? which is lower than D3's 3.127? So the average is 2.523.\n\n   Now, we generate the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2016-07-05: [2.47, 2.754, 2.3985, 2.1855, 2.665, 2.7005, 2.505, 2.914, 2.4695, 2.363, 2.8075, 2.8605, 2.5945, 2.825, 3.198, 2.8425, 2.772, 2.683, 2.4875, 2.363, 2.292, 2.31, 2.523, 3.269]\n        Day2: 2016-07-06: same as above\n        Day3: 2016-07-07: same\n        Day4: 2016-07-08: same\n\n   However, we note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have enough to capture weekly. Also, the pattern for Friday (D1) was different from Saturday (D2) and Sunday (D3) and Monday (D4). But we are forecasting Tuesday to Friday? \n\n   Without more data, we assume the pattern of the last two days (Sunday and Monday) is representative for the next days? \n\n   Alternatively, we could use the average of the 4 days? But that would smooth out the recent increase? \n\n   I think using the last two days is a reasonable choice.\n\n   Let me write the forecast in the required format.\n\n   We must output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        date, MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00, 2.47\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00, 2.754\n        ... \n        2016-07-08 23:00:00, 3.269\n\n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimals? \n\n   The original data had 3 decimal places? \n        e.g., 0.462, 0.426, ... 3.482.\n\n   So we round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me recalculate with rounding:\n\n        hour0: (2.310+2.630)/2 = 2.470\n        hour1: (2.843+2.665)/2 = 2.754\n        hour2: (2.203+2.594)/2 = 2.3985 -> 2.399 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        hour3: (1.990+2.381)/2 = 2.1855 -> 2.186\n        hour4: (2.807+2.523)/2 = 2.665 -> 2.665 (exact)\n        hour5: (2.452+2.949)/2 = 2.7005 -> 2.701\n        hour6: (2.203+2.807)/2 = 2.505 -> 2.505\n        hour7: (2.843+2.985)/2 = 2.914 -> 2.914\n        hour8: (2.025+2.914)/2 = 2.4695 -> 2.470\n        hour9: (1.670+3.056)/2 = 2.363 -> 2.363\n        hour10: (2.559+3.056)/2 = 2.8075 -> 2.808\n        hour11: (2.487+3.234)/2 = 2.8605 -> 2.861\n        hour12: (2.559+2.630)/2 = 2.5945 -> 2.595\n        hour13: (2.630+3.020)/2 = 2.825 -> 2.825\n        hour14: (3.020+3.376)/2 = 3.198 -> 3.198\n        hour15: (2.665+3.020)/2 = 2.8425 -> 2.843\n        hour16: (2.985+2.559)/2 = 2.772 -> 2.772\n        hour17: (2.914+2.452)/2 = 2.683 -> 2.683\n        hour18: (2.523+2.452)/2 = 2.4875 -> 2.488\n        hour19: (2.487+2.239)/2 = 2.363 -> 2.363\n        hour20: (2.345+2.239)/2 = 2.292 -> 2.292\n        hour21: (2.310+2.310)/2 = 2.310\n        hour22: (3.127+1.919)/2 = 2.523 -> 2.523\n        hour23: (3.056+3.482)/2 = 3.269\n\n   Now, we write the next 4 days with these 24 values repeated.\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        Day5: 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-05 23:00:00\n        Day6: 2016-07-06 00:00:00 to 2016-07-06 23:00:00\n        Day7: 2016-07-07 00:00:00 to 2016-07-07 23:00:00\n        Day8: 2016-07-08 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00\n\n   We output in the same format: \"date\" and \"MULL\" (with the value rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n   But note: the original data had the date as index? We output as two columns.\n\n   We write:\n\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00,2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00,2.754\n        ... \n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Let me write the first day:\n\n        hour0: 2016-07-05 00:00:00 -> 2.470\n        hour1: 2016-07-05 01:00:00 -> 2.754\n        hour2: 2016-07-05 02:00:00 -> 2.399\n        hour3: 2016-07-05 03:00:00 -> 2.186\n        hour4: 2016-07-05 04:00:00 -> 2.665\n        hour5: 2016-07-05 05:00:00 -> 2.701\n        hour6: 2016-07-05 06:00:00 -> 2.505\n        hour7: 2016-07-05 07:00:00 -> 2.914\n        hour8: 2016-07-05 08:00:00 -> 2.470\n        hour9: 2016-07-05 09:00:00 -> 2.363\n        hour10: 2016-07-05 10:00:00 -> 2.808\n        hour11: 2016-07-05 11:00:00 -> 2.861\n        hour12: 2016-07-05 12:00:00 -> 2.595\n        hour13: 2016-07-05 13:00:00 -> 2.825\n        hour14: 2016-07-05 14:00:00 -> 3.198\n        hour15: 2016-07-05 15:00:00 -> 2.843\n        hour16: 2016-07-05 16:00:00 -> 2.772\n        hour17: 2016-07-05 17:00:00 -> 2.683\n        hour18: 2016-07-05 18:00:00 -> 2.488\n        hour19: 2016-07-05 19:00:00 -> 2.363\n        hour20: 2016-07-05 20:00:00 -> 2.292\n        hour21: 2016-07-05 21:00:00 -> 2.310\n        hour22: 2016-07-05 22:00:00 -> 2.523\n        hour23: 2016-07-05 23:00:00 -> 3.269\n\n   Then the next day (2016-07-06) same values.\n\n   We do this for 4 days.\n\n   We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n        date,MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00,2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00,2.754\n        ... (96 lines)\n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the original data had the column name as \"MULL\", so we output the same column name.\n\n   However, the original data had the index as the date and then a column named \"MULL\". We output two columns: date and MULL.\n\n   We write the date in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n   Let's code the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-05 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-07-08 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n   We'll generate the dates and then assign the values by cycling through the 24 base values.\n\n   We output without the index.\n\n   We write:\n\n        date, MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00,2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00,2.754\n        ... \n\n   We must be careful: the base pattern is for hour0 to hour23, and then we repeat.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we output 96 lines.\n\n   Let me write the base pattern as a list:\n\n        base = [2.470, 2.754, 2.399, 2.186, 2.665, 2.701, 2.505, 2.914, 2.470, 2.363, 2.808, 2.861, 2.595, 2.825, 3.198, 2.843, 2.772, 2.683, 2.488, 2.363, 2.292, 2.310, 2.523, 3.269]\n\n   Then for day in range(5,9): # 5,6,7,8 -> 4 days\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = f\"2016-07-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            value = base[hour]\n\n   But note: July has 31 days, so 5,6,7,8 are valid.\n\n   We output.\n\n   However, note: the base pattern for hour8 is 2.470, which is the same as hour0? That's because we computed independently.\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   We output.\n\n   But note: the original data had the date as a string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", and the MULL as a float with 3 decimals.\n\n   We write the MULL as a number with 3 decimal places.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   Let me write the first few lines:\n\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00,2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00,2.754\n        2016-07-05 02:00:00,2.399\n        2016-07-05 03:00:00,2.186\n        2016-07-05 04:00:00,2.665\n        2016-07-05 05:00:00,2.701\n        2016-07-05 06:00:00,2.505\n        2016-07-05 07:00:00,2.914\n        2016-07-05 08:00:00,2.470\n        2016-07-05 09:00:00,2.363\n        2016-07-05 10:00:00,2.808\n        2016-07-05 11:00:00,2.861\n        2016-07-05 12:00:00,2.595\n        2016-07-05 13:00:00,2.825\n        2016-07-05 14:00:00,3.198\n        2016-07-05 15:00:00,2.843\n        2016-07-05 16:00:00,2.772\n        2016-07-05 17:00:00,2.683\n        2016-07-05 18:00:00,2.488\n        2016-07-05 19:00:00,2.363\n        2016-07-05 20:00:00,2.292\n        2016-07-05 21:00:00,2.310\n        2016-07-05 22:00:00,2.523\n        2016-07-05 23:00:00,3.269\n\n        Then for 2016-07-06: same 24 numbers.\n\n   We output 4 times.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? We are not given any in the history, and we are generating a complete forecast. So we are good.\n\n   We output in the required format.\n\n   Note: the example output in the problem had the date as the index? But we are to output two columns: date and MULL.\n\n   We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n        date,MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00,2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00,2.754\n        ... \n        </answer>\n\n   But wait, the problem's example input had:\n\n               date  MULL\n        2016-07-01 00:00:00 0.462\n\n   So we output without the index and without the header? Or with the header? \n\n   The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n   And the example input had the header: \"date\" and \"MULL\". So we output the header? \n\n   But the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\" and then shows:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   It does not specify whether to include the header. However, the example input included the header? \n\n   To be safe, we include the header.\n\n   So first line: \"date,MULL\"\n\n   Then 96 lines of data.\n\n   We write.\n\n   Let me write the first 5 lines of the output:\n\n        date,MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00,2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00,2.754\n        2016-07-05 02:00:00,2.399\n        2016-07-05 03:00:00,2.186\n        ...\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content.\" so we must output all 96.\n\n   We have 1 header line and 96 data lines? But the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 data points? \n\n   The example input had 96 data points without the header? \n\n   The problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then listed 96 lines without header? \n\n   But then we are to forecast the next 96. So we output 96 lines? Without header? \n\n   Let me check the problem: \n\n        \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n   and the example input had:\n\n        2016-07-01 00:00:00 0.462\n        ... \n\n   without header? \n\n   But the example input also had:\n\n               date  MULL\n        2016-07-01 00:00:00 0.462\n\n   So it had a header? \n\n   To be safe, I will output without the header? Because the problem says \"the complete data\" meaning the data points? \n\n   But the problem also says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and the example input included the header? \n\n   I think we should include the header to be clear.\n\n   But the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\" and then shows:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   and the \"...\" is the data? \n\n   The example input had the header? \n\n   I will include the header.\n\n   Alternatively, we can look at the problem: the user gave the data with the header? \n\n   The user input:\n\n               date  MULL\n        2016-07-01 00:00:00 0.462\n\n   So we output the same? \n\n   We output:\n\n        date,MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00,2.470\n        ...\n\n   But note: the original had a space? We output comma separated? \n\n   The original input had:\n\n        \"2016-07-01 00:00:00 0.462\"\n\n   with a space? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n   and the example input had the date as a column and MULL as a column? \n\n   We can output with space? \n\n   But the problem does not specify the delimiter. \n\n   The example input in the problem had:\n\n        \"               date  MULL\n        2016-07-01 00:00:00 0.462\"\n\n   So the data had a space? \n\n   We can use space? \n\n   But the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\" and then shows:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   without specifying the delimiter? \n\n   To be safe, we use the same as the input: the input had the date as a string and then the MULL as a float, separated by space? \n\n   But the first line had \"date\" and \"MULL\" as header? \n\n   We output:\n\n        date MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00 2.470\n        ...\n\n   But note: the original input had the date string including the time? and then a space and then the MULL.\n\n   We do the same.\n\n   We output:\n\n        date MULL\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00 2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00 2.754\n        ...\n\n   But the problem says \"the complete data\", and the example input had the header? \n\n   We include the header.\n\n   Alternatively, if the problem expects only the data points, then we output without header? \n\n   Since the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", and the example input had 96 data points (with the header above) but the data points themselves did not have the header? \n\n   I think we should output without the header? \n\n   Let me see: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 lines of data? \n\n   And the example input had 96 lines of data? \n\n   So we output 96 lines? \n\n   Without the header? \n\n   We'll output without the header? \n\n   But the problem says \"complete data\", and the example input had the header? \n\n   I think the header was provided for context. The forecast data should be in the same format as the data points? \n\n   The data points were:\n\n        2016-07-01 00:00:00 0.462\n\n   So we output:\n\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00 2.470\n\n   without the header? \n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   So:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00 2.470\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00 2.754\n        ...
