        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days) of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2017-07-24 00:00:00 to 2017-07-27 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also weekly patterns might be present (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not evident).\n 2. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, the provided past data is complete.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data is hourly with daily seasonality, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints of the problem and that we are to provide a complete set of 96 forecasts, we can use:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n\n However, note that we are only given 4 days of data ) and we are to forecast the next 4 days. With such a short history, complex models might not be robust.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n   - Compute the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that might be changing (for example, the load on 2017-07-23 is higher than the previous days). \n\n Another idea: use the last week's same hour? But we don't have a full week of data, only 4 days.\n\n Considering the data, we see that the pattern repeats daily but with some variation. We can try to take the average of the same hour for the past 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n However, we note that the last day (2017-07-23) has higher values. So we might want to give more weight to the recent day.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Option 1: Use the average of each hour over the 4 days.\n\n   For hour h (0 to 23), the forecast for the next 4 days at hour h would be:\n        forecast = (D1_h + D2_h + D3_h + D4_h) / 4\n\n   But this would ignore any trend.\n\n Option 2: Use a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights.\n\n   For example, weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] for the four days (from oldest to newest).\n\n Option 3: Use the last day (2017-07-23) as the base and adjust by the average of the differences between consecutive days.\n\n However, given the short history, we are forecasting 4 days, we can assume that the pattern of the next 4 days will be similar to the last 4 days, but we can also incorporate a trend.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we don't have to impute for the past.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and we must provide the data, we need to generate 96 numbers.\n\n After reviewing the data, we see that the load has:\n   - A daily cycle: low during the night, rising in the morning, and peaks in the evening (around 20:00-21:00).\n   - The peak on 2017-07-23 is higher than the previous days.\n\n We can compute the average for each hour and then adjust by a trend factor.\n\n How to compute the trend?\n   We can compute the overall average of each day and then see the trend in the daily averages.\n\n   Day 1 (2017-07-20): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n   Day 2: average\n   Day 3: average\n   Day 4: average\n\n   Then the daily averages are:\n        Day1: 4.843+4.447+...+5.696 = let's compute quickly: \n            We can approximate: \n            The values range from about 3.2 to 7.5 -> average around 5.0? \n            Actually, we can calculate:\n\n        We'll calculate the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (20th): \n            Sum = 4.843+4.447+4.203+3.716+3.259+3.381+4.112+3.655+4.082+4.264+4.599+5.117+5.269+5.452+5.422+5.300+4.630+4.569+4.538+4.691+7.006+7.493+6.853+5.696\n            = 113.326\n            Average = 113.326 / 24 = 4.722\n\n        Day2 (21st): \n            Sum = 5.148+4.813+4.477+4.203+3.929+4.051+3.990+3.716+4.142+4.203+4.630+4.904+5.056+5.696+5.665+5.544+5.300+5.208+4.904+5.148+7.737+7.889+6.914+6.457\n            = 118.225\n            Average = 118.225 / 24 = 4.926\n\n        Day3 (22nd):\n            Sum = 5.909+5.056+4.630+4.112+3.960+3.929+4.569+4.630+4.752+4.843+5.087+6.000+6.183+6.792+6.640+6.731+5.909+5.818+5.483+6.000+7.889+7.980+7.280+6.610\n            = 125.752\n            Average = 125.752 / 24 = 5.240\n\n        Day4 (23rd):\n            Sum = 5.909+5.391+4.934+4.599+4.264+4.386+4.538+4.691+5.208+4.843+5.604+6.305+6.853+7.280+6.701+6.396+6.335+6.275+5.787+6.153+8.498+8.285+8.285+8.285\n            = 134.302\n            Average = 134.302 / 24 = 5.596\n\n        The daily averages are: [4.722, 4.926, 5.240, 5.596] -> increasing.\n\n        The trend: we can fit a linear regression to these 4 points to get a daily increase.\n\n        Let x = [0,1,2,3] for the four days, y = [4.722, 4.926, 5.240, 5.596]\n\n        Slope (beta) = (n*sum(xy) - sum(x)*sum(y)) / (n*sum(x^2) - (sum(x))^2)\n        n=4\n        sum(x) = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n        sum(y) = 4.722+4.926+5.240+5.596 = 20.484\n        sum(xy) = 0*4.722 + 1*4.926 + 2*5.240 + 3*5.596 = 0 + 4.926 + 10.48 + 16.788 = 32.194\n        sum(x^2) = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n        beta = (4*32.194 - 6*20.484) / (4*14 - 6^2) = (128.776 - 122.904) / (56 - 36) = 5.872 / 20 = 0.2936\n\n        So the daily increase is about 0.2936.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) the daily average would be:\n            day5: 5.596 + 0.2936 = 5.8896\n            day6: 5.8896 + 0.2936 = 6.1832\n            day7: 6.1832 + 0.2936 = 6.4768\n            day8: 6.4768 + 0.2936 = 6.7704\n\n        But note: we are only forecasting 4 days (96 hours) so we need day5 to day8 (which are the next 4 days).\n\n        Now, for each hour of the day, we have 4 historical values. We can compute the base pattern for each hour by averaging the 4 days.\n\n        However, we can adjust the base pattern by the trend. Specifically, we can compute the relative weight of each hour in a day (i.e., the hourly profile) and then scale by the daily average.\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average for each hour over the 4 days.\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): \n            values: [4.843, 5.148, 5.909, 5.909] -> average = (4.843+5.148+5.909+5.909)/4 = 5.45225\n\n        But note: the daily average is increasing, so the hour 0 on day1 is 4.843, which is below the daily average of day1 (4.722) -> so it's above by 4.843-4.722=0.121.\n        Alternatively, we can compute the relative value: (value / daily_avg) for that day.\n\n        Then for each hour, we have 4 relative values. Then we average the relative values for that hour to get a relative factor.\n\n        Then for a future day, we can do: forecasted_hour = relative_factor * forecasted_daily_avg.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n        Step 1: For each day, compute the daily average (we have them: [4.722, 4.926, 5.240, 5.596] for day1 to day4).\n\n        Step 2: For each hour in the day (0-23) and for each day, compute: value / daily_avg for that day.\n\n        Step 3: For each hour, average the 4 relative factors.\n\n        Step 4: For the next 4 days (day5 to day8), we have the forecasted daily averages: [5.8896, 6.1832, 6.4768, 6.7704]\n\n        Step 5: For a specific hour h in day d (where d=5,6,7,8), the forecast = (average_relative_factor for hour h) * (forecasted_daily_avg for day d)\n\n        This method preserves the intraday pattern and applies the daily level.\n\n        Let's compute the relative factors for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00):\n            Day1: 4.843 / 4.722 = 1.0256\n            Day2: 5.148 / 4.926 = 1.0451\n            Day3: 5.909 / 5.240 = 1.1277\n            Day4: 5.909 / 5.596 = 1.0559\n            Average = (1.0256+1.0451+1.1277+1.0559)/4 = 4.2543/4 = 1.0636\n\n        Similarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\n        Then for day5 (2017-07-24) at 00:00: forecast = 1.0636 * 5.8896 = 6.26\n\n        But note: the relative factors for hour0 vary a lot: from 1.0256 to 1.1277. The average 1.0636 might be reasonable.\n\n        However, we have only 4 days, and the last two days have higher relative factors for hour0. We might use a weighted average for the relative factors? But for simplicity, we use the average.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the median? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        We'll use the average.\n\n        We must compute for all 24 hours.\n\n        This is a lot of computation, but we can write a program. However, we are to provide the answer, so we do it manually? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the absolute values for each hour and then adjust by the daily average? \n\n        Actually, the method above (using relative factors) is standard.\n\n        But note: the daily average is the average of the 24 hours. The relative factors for the 24 hours in a day should average to 1.0. Let's check:\n\n            For day1: the sum of (value / daily_avg) for 24 hours = (sum of values) / daily_avg = (24 * daily_avg) / daily_avg = 24.\n\n            So the average of the relative factors for a day is 1.0. Therefore, the average relative factor for a specific hour over the 4 days should be around 1.0? Not exactly, because we are averaging the same hour.\n\n        Actually, the average of the 24 relative factors (for each hour) over the 4 days should be 1.0? \n\n            The sum of the 24 relative factors for a day is 24. So the average of the 24 relative factors for a day is 1.0.\n\n            Then when we average over 4 days for a fixed hour, we get a number that is the average relative factor for that hour.\n\n        This method is called \"seasonal adjustment by averaging\".\n\n        We'll compute the relative factors for each hour and then use them.\n\n        Due to the length, we can compute in code, but we are to provide the answer. So we do the first few and then we can write a table.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the absolute values for each hour and then scale them to the daily average? \n\n        But note: the daily average is increasing, so we cannot use the absolute average without scaling.\n\n        We'll do the relative factor method.\n\n        Steps:\n\n        Let D = [4.722, 4.926, 5.240, 5.596]   # daily averages for day1 to day4\n\n        For hour0 (00:00):\n            values = [4.843, 5.148, 5.909, 5.909]\n            relative = [4.843/4.722, 5.148/4.926, 5.909/5.240, 5.909/5.596] \n                     = [1.0256, 1.0451, 1.1277, 1.0559]\n            avg_relative0 = (1.0256+1.0451+1.1277+1.0559)/4 = 4.2543/4 = 1.063575\n\n        Similarly, for hour1 (01:00):\n            values = [4.447, 4.813, 5.056, 5.391]\n            relative = [4.447/4.722, 4.813/4.926, 5.056/5.240, 5.391/5.596]\n                     = [0.9418, 0.9770, 0.9649, 0.9632]\n            avg_relative1 = (0.9418+0.9770+0.9649+0.9632)/4 = 3.8469/4 = 0.9617\n\n        We do for all 24 hours.\n\n        Then the forecast for:\n\n          Day5 (2017-07-24) at hour0: 1.063575 * 5.8896 = 6.26\n          Day5 at hour1: 0.9617 * 5.8896 = 5.66\n\n        And so on.\n\n        We have to do this for 24 hours and then for 4 days.\n\n        But note: the daily averages for the next 4 days are:\n            day5: 5.8896\n            day6: 6.1832\n            day7: 6.4768\n            day8: 6.7704\n\n        We'll generate 24*4=96 data points.\n\n        However, note: the trend we computed (0.2936 per day) is linear. We are extrapolating the daily average linearly. This might be reasonable for 4 days.\n\n        But we must be cautious: the daily average increased by about 0.2, 0.3, 0.35 from day1 to day4. The linear trend is 0.2936 per day. \n\n        We'll proceed.\n\n        We need to compute the relative factors for all 24 hours.
