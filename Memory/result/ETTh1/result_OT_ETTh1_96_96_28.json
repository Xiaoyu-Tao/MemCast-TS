        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing value warning, but the provided 96 points are complete? \n    However, the last value on 2016-10-24 23:00:00 is 14.632, and we have to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days), we can use a time series model.\n\n 3. Given the constraints of the problem and that we are to provide a complete answer without any omission, \n    we must generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n 4. We are not told the frequency of the data in the entire dataset (whether originally hourly or 15-min), but \n    the provided data is hourly. The next 96 should be hourly as well.\n\n 5. We can use a simple model like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a naive method. However, without the ability to run code, \n    we must rely on a reasonable approach.\n\n 6. Given the data, we observe:\n    - There is a daily pattern (diurnal variation) because the temperature drops at night and rises during the day.\n    - We have 4 days of data (96 hours) so we can try to capture the seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n 7. We choose a model: Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) would be appropriate. But since we cannot run code, we have to simulate the output.\n\n 8. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. \n    We are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 9. Since we are to provide the complete data, we will generate 96 timestamps and corresponding OT values.\n\n 10. How to simulate the forecast?\n     We can use the last 96 points to compute a simple average pattern for a day and then project forward with adjustments.\n\n     Steps for a naive seasonal forecast:\n        - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), average the values at that hour over the 4 days we have.\n        - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), use the average for the corresponding hour.\n\n     But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day 1 (Oct 21): min ~12.1, max ~18.92\n        Day 2 (Oct 22): min ~10.55, max ~16.53\n        Day 3 (Oct 23): min ~14.14, max ~16.95\n        Day 4 (Oct 24): min ~14.63, max ~20.82\n\n     There is no clear trend. We see a drop on day 2 and then a rise on day 4.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the last day (Oct 24) as the base and adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n     However, the problem does not specify the time of year and we don't have long-term data. \n\n 11. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we will use a simple method:\n\n      We compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n      Steps:\n        - Group by hour (e.g., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n      But note: the last day (Oct 24) has a higher overall level? We might want to the last day's level? \n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Oct 24) and adjust by the average daily fluctuation (relative to the daily mean) from the entire period.\n\n     However, for simplicity and to have a complete answer, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 13. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (16.954 + 13.929 + 14.843 + 15.476) / 4 = (16.954+13.929=30.883; 30.883+14.843=45.726; 45.726+15.476=61.202) -> 61.202/4 = 15.3005\n     Hour 1: (17.657+12.662+14.140+16.461)/4 = (17.657+12.662=30.319; 30.319+14.140=44.459; 44.459+16.461=60.92) -> 60.92/4=15.23\n     ... and so on.\n\n 14. But note: the data has 3 decimal places? We'll keep 3 decimals.\n\n 15. However, this method ignores any trend and the fact that the last day was higher. We might adjust by the level of the last day.\n\n     Another method: \n        - Compute the daily average for each day.\n        - Then, for each hour, compute the deviation from the daily average for that day (so we get a normalized hour effect).\n        - Then, average the deviations for each hour (across the 4 days) to get the typical deviation for that hour.\n        - Then, for the next days, we need a daily average forecast. We can use the last day's daily average? or the average of the last few days? \n          But we don't have a trend. We'll use the average of the last day (Oct 24) as the base daily average for the next days? \n          Or we can use the overall average? \n\n     However, to keep it simple and since we are to provide an answer, we'll use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 16. We'll compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. Steps for computation:\n\n     We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n     We'll group by the hour of the day (ignoring the day part) and then take the mean.\n\n 18. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00:00: [16.954, 13.929, 14.843, 15.476] -> mean = (16.954+13.929+14.843+15.476)/4 = 15.3005 -> 15.301\n     Hour 01:00: [17.657, 12.662, 14.140, 16.461] -> (17.657+12.662+14.140+16.461)/4 = 15.230\n     Hour 02:00: [17.798, 12.662, 15.195, 17.094] -> (17.798+12.662+15.195+17.094)/4 = 15.68725 -> 15.687\n     ... and so on.\n\n 19. Then, for the next 4 days (2016-10-25 to 2016-10-28), we assign the hour 00:00 the value 15.301, 01:00 15.230, etc.\n\n 20. But note: the dates must be generated as well.\n\n     Start from: 2016-10-25 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-10-24 23:00:00)\n\n 21. We generate 96 hours from 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        date = pd.date_range(start='2016-10-25 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 23. Then assign the OT values by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 24. However, note: the average pattern is computed from 4 days, so we are using the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 25. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the provided data:\n\n     We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of 24 values.\n\n 26. We do:\n\n        hour0 = [16.954, 13.929, 14.843, 15.476] -> mean = 15.3005 -> 15.301\n        hour1 = [17.657, 12.662, 14.140, 16.461] -> mean = (17.657+12.662+14.140+16.461)/4 = 60.92/4 = 15.230\n        hour2 = [17.798, 12.662, 15.195, 17.094] -> (17.798+12.662=30.46; 30.46+15.195=45.655; 45.655+17.094=62.749) -> 62.749/4=15.68725 -> 15.687\n        hour3 = [17.446, 13.858, 15.265, 16.883] -> (17.446+13.858=31.304; 31.304+15.265=46.569; 46.569+16.883=63.452) -> 63.452/4=15.863\n        hour4 = [14.421, 13.507, 14.843, 17.446] -> (14.421+13.507=27.928; 27.928+14.843=42.771; 42.771+17.446=60.217) -> 60.217/4=15.05425 -> 15.054\n        hour5 = [17.165, 15.617, 13.999, 17.305] -> (17.165+15.617=32.782; 32.782+13.999=46.781; 46.781+17.305=64.086) -> 64.086/4=16.0215 -> 16.022\n        hour6 = [17.657, 12.733, 14.703, 15.758] -> (17.657+12.733=30.39; 30.39+14.703=45.093; 45.093+15.758=60.851) -> 60.851/4=15.21275 -> 15.213\n        hour7 = [15.969, 12.100, 15.054, 15.406] -> (15.969+12.100=28.069; 28.069+15.054=43.123; 43.123+15.406=58.529) -> 58.529/4=14.63225 -> 14.632\n        hour8 = [18.009, 12.381, 15.195, 17.024] -> (18.009+12.381=30.39; 30.39+15.195=45.585; 45.585+17.024=62.609) -> 62.609/4=15.65225 -> 15.652\n        hour9 = [17.868, 11.889, 14.351, 15.336] -> (17.868+11.889=29.757; 29.757+14.351=44.108; 44.108+15.336=59.444) -> 59.444/4=14.861\n        hour10: [18.220, 11.537, 15.265, 18.079] -> (18.220+11.537=29.757; 29.757+15.265=45.022; 45.022+18.079=63.101) -> 63.101/4=15.77525 -> 15.775\n        hour11: [18.923, 11.044, 16.321, 18.572] -> (18.923+11.044=29.967; 29.967+16.321=46.288; 46.288+18.572=64.86) -> 64.86/4=16.215\n        hour12: [18.220, 11.326, 14.280, 18.431] -> (18.220+11.326=29.546; 29.546+14.280=43.826; 43.826+18.431=62.257) -> 62.257/4=15.56425 -> 15.564\n        hour13: [17.446, 10.833, 14.914, 18.853] -> (17.446+10.833=28.279; 28.279+14.914=43.193; 43.193+18.853=62.046) -> 62.046/4=15.5115 -> 15.512\n        hour14: [18.079, 10.974, 16.109, 18.431] -> (18.079+10.974=29.053; 29.053+16.109=45.162; 45.162+18.431=63.593) -> 63.593/4=15.89825 -> 15.898\n        hour15: [17.868, 10.552, 16.602, 18.923] -> (17.868+10.552=28.42; 28.42+16.602=45.022; 45.022+18.923=63.945) -> 63.945/4=15.98625 -> 15.986\n        hour16: [18.009, 14.773, 15.336, 20.823] -> (18.009+14.773=32.782; 32.782+15.336=48.118; 48.118+20.823=68.941) -> 68.941/4=17.23525 -> 17.235\n        hour17: [14.914, 14.914, 14.491, 19.275] -> (14.914+14.914=29.828; 29.828+14.491=44.319; 44.319+19.275=63.594) -> 63.594/4=15.8985 -> 15.899\n        hour18: [18.220, 15.125, 15.195, 18.290] -> (18.220+15.125=33.345; 33.345+15.195=48.54; 48.54+18.290=66.83) -> 66.83/4=16.7075 -> 16.708\n        hour19: [18.220, 16.532, 15.547, 19.416] -> (18.220+16.532=34.752; 34.752+15.547=50.299; 50.299+19.416=69.715) -> 69.715/4=17.42875 -> 17.429\n        hour20: [17.446, 12.733, 15.476, 19.064] -> (17.446+12.733=30.179; 30.179+15.476=45.655; 45.655+19.064=64.719) -> 64.719/4=16.17975 -> 16.180\n        hour21: [16.532, 14.703, 16.602, 17.446] -> (16.532+14.703=31.235; 31.235+16.602=47.837; 47.837+17.446=65.283) -> 65.283/4=16.32075 -> 16.321\n        hour22: [17.657, 14.984, 16.954, 17.305] -> (17.657+14.984=32.641; 32.641+16.954=49.595; 49.595+17.305=66.9) -> 66.9/4=16.725\n        hour23: [14.491, 15.195, 16.039, 14.632] -> (14.491+15.195=29.686; 29.686+16.039=45.725; 45.725+14.632=60.357) -> 60.357/4=15.08925 -> 15.089\n\n 27. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-10-25): \n            00:00: 15.301\n            01:00: 15.230\n            02:00: 15.687\n            03:00: 15.863\n            04:00: 15.054\n            05:00: 16.022\n            06:00: 15.213\n            07:00: 14.632\n            08:00: 15.652\n            09:00: 14.861\n            10:00: 15.775\n            11:00: 16.215\n            12:00: 15.564\n            13:00: 15.512\n            14:00: 15.898\n            15:00: 15.986\n            16:00: 17.235\n            17:00: 15.899\n            18:00: 16.708\n            19:00: 17.429\n            20:00: 16.180\n            21:00: 16.321\n            22:00: 16.725\n            23:00: 15.089\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days (2016-10-26, 2016-10-27, 2016-10-28).\n\n 28. But note: the last day (Oct 24) had a higher level? We are using the average which might be a bit low for the last day's level? \n     However, without a trend model, we are using a constant pattern.\n\n 29. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 30. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n               date        OT\n2016-10-25 00:00:00 15.301\n2016-10-25 01:00:00 15.230\n2016-10-25 02:00:00 15.687\n... (and so on for 96 rows)\n```\n\n 31. We must be precise: the dates are in the format and the OT values are rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 32. We'll write the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. Let's list the hourly averages again (with rounding to 3 decimals):\n\n        hour0: 15.301\n        hour1: 15.230\n        hour2: 15.687\n        hour3: 15.863\n        hour4: 15.054\n        hour5: 16.022\n        hour6: 15.213\n        hour7: 14.632\n        hour8: 15.652\n        hour9: 14.861\n        hour10: 15.775\n        hour11: 16.215\n        hour12: 15.564\n        hour13: 15.512\n        hour14: 15.898\n        hour15: 15.986\n        hour16: 17.235\n        hour17: 15.899\n        hour18: 16.708\n        hour19: 17.429\n        hour20: 16.180\n        hour21: 16.321\n        hour22: 16.725\n        hour23: 15.089\n\n 34. Now, we generate 4 days of data (2016-10-25 to 2016-10-28) with the same 24 values repeated.\n\n 35. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 36. Note: The original data had 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 37.
