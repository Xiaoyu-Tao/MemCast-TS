        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) and possibly weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days of data.\n 2. Given the short history, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 (since hourly data).\n 3. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast might need to account for the possibility of missing data in the training? \n    But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided data might have missing values? But in the given 96 points, we see no missing. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 4. We choose a model: Given the seasonality and the limited data, we can use a seasonal naive method, or more advanced models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n    However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA model might be challenging. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - The data shows a daily pattern. We can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 5. But note: the data from 2016-08-09 has a spike at 00:00 (6.183) which is higher than the previous days. This might be an anomaly? \n    We must be cautious. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-08-09) as the pattern for the next days? \n\n 6. However, the problem says the data has missing values. Since we are only given 96 points without missing, we assume we are to forecast the next 96 without gaps.\n\n 7. Approach: We will use a seasonal naive forecast by taking the last day (2016-08-09) and repeating it for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the pattern might change. Alternatively, we can use the average of the four days for each hour.\n\n 8. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (00:00 to 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 9. Steps for averaging:\n     - We have 4 days, each with 24 hours -> 4 observations per hour.\n     - For hour h (h from 0 to 23), we compute the average of the LUFL at that hour for the 4 days.\n\n 10. Then, for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 11. Why average? Because it smooths out any single day anomaly.\n\n 12. However, note that the last day (2016-08-09) has a spike at 00:00 (6.183) which is much higher than the previous days (3.198, 2.772, 3.198). \n     This might be an outlier? But without more context, we include it in the average.\n\n 13. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00:00: (4.873, 2.772, 3.198, 6.183) -> (4.873+2.772+3.198+6.183)/4 = 17.026/4 = 4.2565\n     Hour 01:00: (4.477, 2.498, 2.985, 5.665) -> (4.477+2.498+2.985+5.665)/4 = 15.625/4 = 3.90625\n     ... and so on.\n\n 14. Then we repeat this average pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 15. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are only given 96 complete points. \n     We are forecasting the next 96 points. We are not given any missing values in the provided data, so we don't need to impute in the training.\n\n 16. We generate the next 96 timestamps: \n     - The last timestamp in the data is 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n     - The next 96 hours: \n        Day 1: 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-10 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2016-08-11 00:00:00 to 2016-08-11 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2016-08-12 00:00:00 to 2016-08-12 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2016-08-13 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00\n\n 17. For each of these 4 days, we assign the 24 average values we computed.\n\n 18. We must output the complete 96 forecasted points in the same format.\n\n 19. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n     Hour 0: [4.873, 2.772, 3.198, 6.183] -> 4.2565\n     Hour 1: [4.477, 2.498, 2.985, 5.665] -> 3.90625\n     Hour 2: [4.203, 2.224, 2.741, 5.300] -> 3.617\n     Hour 3: [4.234, 2.163, 2.528, 5.300] -> 3.55625\n     Hour 4: [4.234, 2.102, 2.498, 5.026] -> 3.465\n     Hour 5: [4.508, 2.345, 2.498, 4.934] -> 3.57125\n     Hour 6: [4.873, 2.254, 2.711, 5.513] -> 3.83775\n     Hour 7: [4.660, 2.284, 2.985, 5.361] -> 3.8225\n     Hour 8: [2.467, 2.224, 2.680, 3.198] -> 2.64225\n     Hour 9: [2.467, 2.894, 2.863, 2.894] -> 2.7795\n     Hour 10: [3.015, 3.137, 3.503, 3.472] -> 3.28175\n     Hour 11: [3.290, 3.686, 3.655, 3.838] -> 3.61725\n     Hour 12: [2.924, 3.503, 3.503, 3.716] -> 3.4115\n     Hour 13: [3.168, 3.838, 3.625, 4.082] -> 3.67825\n     Hour 14: [2.894, 3.777, 3.503, 4.051] -> 3.55625\n     Hour 15: [3.168, 3.533, 3.655, 3.442] -> 3.4495\n     Hour 16: [3.229, 3.381, 3.686, 3.533] -> 3.45725\n     Hour 17: [3.290, 3.899, 3.655, 3.381] -> 3.55625\n     Hour 18: [3.107, 3.716, 3.625, 3.472] -> 3.48025\n     Hour 19: [3.290, 3.716, 3.838, 3.533] -> 3.59425\n     Hour 20: [4.691, 5.391, 5.726, 5.056] -> 5.216\n     Hour 21: [4.051, 4.904, 5.300, 4.477] -> 4.683\n     Hour 22: [3.381, 4.142, 4.569, 3.929] -> 4.00525\n     Hour 23: [3.168, 3.564, 4.082, 3.655] -> 3.61725\n\n 20. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n     2016-08-10 00:00:00 -> 4.2565\n     2016-08-10 01:00:00 -> 3.90625\n     ... until 2016-08-10 23:00:00 -> 3.61725\n\n     Then 2016-08-11 00:00:00 -> 4.2565\n     ... and so on.\n\n 21. We must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and LUFL) and the LUFL values rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 22. However, note: the input data has LUFL with 3 decimal places. We will round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 23. Let's round the averages:\n\n     Hour0: 4.2565 -> 4.257\n     Hour1: 3.90625 -> 3.906\n     Hour2: 3.617 -> 3.617\n     Hour3: 3.55625 -> 3.556\n     Hour4: 3.465 -> 3.465\n     Hour5: 3.57125 -> 3.571\n     Hour6: 3.83775 -> 3.838\n     Hour7: 3.8225 -> 3.823\n     Hour8: 2.64225 -> 2.642\n     Hour9: 2.7795 -> 2.780\n     Hour10: 3.28175 -> 3.282\n     Hour11: 3.61725 -> 3.617\n     Hour12: 3.4115 -> 3.412\n     Hour13: 3.67825 -> 3.678\n     Hour14: 3.55625 -> 3.556\n     Hour15: 3.4495 -> 3.450\n     Hour16: 3.45725 -> 3.457\n     Hour17: 3.55625 -> 3.556\n     Hour18: 3.48025 -> 3.480\n     Hour19: 3.59425 -> 3.594\n     Hour20: 5.216 -> 5.216\n     Hour21: 4.683 -> 4.683\n     Hour22: 4.00525 -> 4.005\n     Hour23: 3.61725 -> 3.617\n\n 24. Now, we generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n     Start: 2016-08-10 00:00:00\n     Then 2016-08-10 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 26. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 27. We output the data in the exact format as the input, but for the next 96 hours.\n\n 28. We'll write the answer in the <answer> tag as specified.\n\n 29. However, note: the input data has the date format as \"2016-08-06 00:00:00\", so we follow the same.\n\n 30. Let's generate the dates:\n\n     We start from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 and add 96 hours.\n\n 31. Code for generating the dates (but we do it manually for 4 days):\n\n     Day 1: 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n     Day 2: 2016-08-11 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n     Day 3: 2016-08-12 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n     Day 4: 2016-08-13 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 32. Now, we assign the rounded average values for each hour of the day for these 4 days.\n\n 33. We write the data in the following format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-10 00:00:00 4.257\n2016-08-10 01:00:00 3.906\n...\n2016-08-13 23:00:00 3.617\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 34. We must have 96 lines.\n\n 35. Let's write the first day:\n\n     2016-08-10 00:00:00 4.257\n     2016-08-10 01:00:00 3.906\n     2016-08-10 02:00:00 3.617\n     2016-08-10 03:00:00 3.556\n     2016-08-10 04:00:00 3.465\n     2016-08-10 05:00:00 3.571\n     2016-08-10 06:00:00 3.838\n     2016-08-10 07:00:00 3.823\n     2016-08-10 08:00:00 2.642\n     2016-08-10 09:00:00 2.780\n     2016-08-10 10:00:00 3.282\n     2016-08-10 11:00:00 3.617\n     2016-08-10 12:00:00 3.412\n     2016-08-10 13:00:00 3.678\n     2016-08-10 14:00:00 3.556\n     2016-08-10 15:00:00 3.450\n     2016-08-10 16:00:00 3.457\n     2016-08-10 17:00:00 3.556\n     2016-08-10 18:00:00 3.480\n     2016-08-10 19:00:00 3.594\n     2016-08-10 20:00:00 5.216\n     2016-08-10 21:00:00 4.683\n     2016-08-10 22:00:00 4.005\n     2016-08-10 23:00:00 3.617\n\n 36. Then the next three days repeat the same pattern.\n\n 37. We write the next 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 38. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting without missing. \n     We are not given any missing in the training, and we are to forecast 96 points.\n\n 39. We output the data.\n\n 40. Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n 41. We note: the rounding we did might have slight differences, but we use the rounded values as above.\n\n 42. We generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 43. We must be cautious: the last day in the input is 2016-08-09, so the next day is 2016-08-10.\n\n 44. We write the answer.\n",
