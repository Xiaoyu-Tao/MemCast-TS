        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can observe that the load varies throughout the day.\n 2. There are missing values in the provided data? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points seem complete. However, we must be cautious. But in the given data, there are no missing values in the 96 points? Let me check: \n    - The data starts at 2016-07-29 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-08-01 23:00:00. That's 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points. So it's complete for the given period.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). We can use a time series method that captures seasonality. Since the data is hourly and we see daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 4. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete answer without the possibility of running code, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n    - We take the average of the same hour across the available days (4 days) and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 5. However, note that the data for 2016-07-31 is constant (all 1.249). This might be an anomaly or a holiday? But we have to work with what we have.\n\n 6. Let's break down the data by hour of the day for the 4 days:\n\n    We have 4 days: Day0 (2016-07-29), Day1 (2016-07-30), Day2 (2016-07-31), Day3 (2016-08-01)\n\n    For each hour (0 to 23), we have 4 values.\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour across these 4 days and then use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days (2016-08-02 to 2016-08-05).\n\n 7. But note: the user said the data will have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we assume the provided data is complete. For the forecast period, we are to generate 96 points without missing values.\n\n 8. Steps for calculation:\n    - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n    Example for hour 0:\n        Day0: 1.310\n        Day1: 1.980\n        Day2: 1.249\n        Day3: 1.157\n        Average = (1.310 + 1.980 + 1.249 + 1.157) / 4 = 1.424\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, at hour 0 we will have:\n        2016-08-02 00:00:00: 1.424\n        2016-08-03 00:00:00: 1.424\n        2016-08-04 00:00:00: 1.424\n        2016-08-05 00:00:00: 1.424\n\n    But note: this will give the same value for the same hour in each day. However, we see in the data that the pattern is not exactly the same every day? But we are using the same average for each day in the forecast.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we might consider that the pattern might change? But without more data, we use the average of the available 4 days.\n\n 10. However, note that the last day (2016-08-01) is a Monday? and the next 4 days are Tuesday to Friday? We don't have information about weekly seasonality. But we only have 4 days of data. So we stick to daily seasonality.\n\n 11. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then for the next 96 hours (4 days) we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern.\n\n 12. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (1.310 + 1.980 + 1.249 + 1.157) / 4 = 1.424\n     Hour 1: (1.188 + 1.797 + 1.249 + 1.066) / 4 = (1.188+1.797=2.985; 2.985+1.249=4.234; 4.234+1.066=5.3) /4 = 1.325\n     Hour 2: (1.127+1.888+1.249+1.066)/4 = (1.127+1.888=3.015; 3.015+1.249=4.264; 4.264+1.066=5.33) /4 = 1.3325\n     Hour 3: (1.249+1.706+1.249+1.218)/4 = (1.249+1.706=2.955; 2.955+1.249=4.204; 4.204+1.218=5.422) /4 = 1.3555\n     Hour 4: (1.157+1.767+1.249+1.066)/4 = (1.157+1.767=2.924; 2.924+1.249=4.173; 4.173+1.066=5.239) /4 = 1.30975\n     Hour 5: (1.097+1.828+1.249+0.975)/4 = (1.097+1.828=2.925; 2.925+1.249=4.174; 4.174+0.975=5.149) /4 = 1.28725\n     Hour 6: (1.371+1.828+1.249+1.249)/4 = (1.371+1.828=3.199; 3.199+1.249=4.448; 4.448+1.249=5.697) /4 = 1.42425\n     Hour 7: (1.340+1.980+1.249+1.249)/4 = (1.340+1.980=3.32; 3.32+1.249=4.569; 4.569+1.249=5.818) /4 = 1.4545\n     Hour 8: (1.432+1.553+1.249+1.401)/4 = (1.432+1.553=2.985; 2.985+1.249=4.234; 4.234+1.401=5.635) /4 = 1.40875\n     Hour 9: (1.340+1.553+1.249+1.218)/4 = (1.340+1.553=2.893; 2.893+1.249=4.142; 4.142+1.218=5.36) /4 = 1.34\n     Hour 10: (1.432+1.432+1.249+1.310)/4 = (1.432+1.432=2.864; 2.864+1.249=4.113; 4.113+1.310=5.423) /4 = 1.35575\n     Hour 11: (0.975+1.584+1.249+1.249)/4 = (0.975+1.584=2.559; 2.559+1.249=3.808; 3.808+1.249=5.057) /4 = 1.26425\n     Hour 12: (1.371+1.401+1.249+1.310)/4 = (1.371+1.401=2.772; 2.772+1.249=4.021; 4.021+1.310=5.331) /4 = 1.33275\n     Hour 13: (1.523+1.492+1.249+1.279)/4 = (1.523+1.492=3.015; 3.015+1.249=4.264; 4.264+1.279=5.543) /4 = 1.38575\n     Hour 14: (1.401+1.492+1.249+1.249)/4 = (1.401+1.492=2.893; 2.893+1.249=4.142; 4.142+1.249=5.391) /4 = 1.34775\n     Hour 15: (1.371+1.462+1.249+1.249)/4 = (1.371+1.462=2.833; 2.833+1.249=4.082; 4.082+1.249=5.331) /4 = 1.33275\n     Hour 16: (1.553+1.401+1.249+1.249)/4 = (1.553+1.401=2.954; 2.954+1.249=4.203; 4.203+1.249=5.452) /4 = 1.363\n     Hour 17: (1.492+1.432+1.249+1.310)/4 = (1.492+1.432=2.924; 2.924+1.249=4.173; 4.173+1.310=5.483) /4 = 1.37075\n     Hour 18: (1.371+1.371+1.249+1.279)/4 = (1.371+1.371=2.742; 2.742+1.249=3.991; 3.991+1.279=5.27) /4 = 1.3175\n     Hour 19: (1.340+0.731+1.249+1.279)/4 = (1.340+0.731=2.071; 2.071+1.249=3.32; 3.32+1.279=4.599) /4 = 1.14975\n     Hour 20: (1.645+0.975+1.249+1.462)/4 = (1.645+0.975=2.62; 2.62+1.249=3.869; 3.869+1.462=5.331) /4 = 1.33275\n     Hour 21: (1.645+1.066+1.249+1.462)/4 = (1.645+1.066=2.711; 2.711+1.249=3.96; 3.96+1.462=5.422) /4 = 1.3555\n     Hour 22: (1.553+0.944+1.249+1.371)/4 = (1.553+0.944=2.497; 2.497+1.249=3.746; 3.746+1.371=5.117) /4 = 1.27925\n     Hour 23: (1.492+1.310+1.249+1.432)/4 = (1.492+1.310=2.802; 2.802+1.249=4.051; 4.051+1.432=5.483) /4 = 1.37075\n\n 13. Now, we create the next 96 hours (from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00) by repeating the above 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n 14. The dates will be:\n     2016-08-02 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.424\n     2016-08-02 01:00:00 -> hour1: 1.325\n     ... until\n     2016-08-02 23:00:00 -> hour23: 1.37075\n\n     Then 2016-08-03 00:00:00: 1.424 (same as hour0)\n     and so on.\n\n 15. We must format the answer exactly as the input: two columns, with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the LULL value with 3 decimal places (as in the input).\n\n 16. We note that the input data had 3 decimal places, so we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 17. Let's round the averages:\n\n     Hour0: 1.424 -> 1.424\n     Hour1: 1.325 -> 1.325? But let's compute exactly:\n        Actually, we computed:\n        Hour0: (1.310+1.980+1.249+1.157)/4 = 5.696/4 = 1.424 -> 1.424\n        Hour1: (1.188+1.797+1.249+1.066) = 5.3 /4 = 1.325 -> 1.325\n        Hour2: 1.3325 -> 1.333 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        Hour3: 1.3555 -> 1.356\n        Hour4: 1.30975 -> 1.310\n        Hour5: 1.28725 -> 1.287\n        Hour6: 1.42425 -> 1.424\n        Hour7: 1.4545 -> 1.455\n        Hour8: 1.40875 -> 1.409\n        Hour9: 1.34 -> 1.340\n        Hour10: 1.35575 -> 1.356\n        Hour11: 1.26425 -> 1.264\n        Hour12: 1.33275 -> 1.333\n        Hour13: 1.38575 -> 1.386\n        Hour14: 1.34775 -> 1.348\n        Hour15: 1.33275 -> 1.333\n        Hour16: 1.363 -> 1.363\n        Hour17: 1.37075 -> 1.371\n        Hour18: 1.3175 -> 1.318\n        Hour19: 1.14975 -> 1.150\n        Hour20: 1.33275 -> 1.333\n        Hour21: 1.3555 -> 1.356\n        Hour22: 1.27925 -> 1.279\n        Hour23: 1.37075 -> 1.371\n\n 18. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day1: 2016-08-02\n        00:00:00 -> 1.424\n        01:00:00 -> 1.325\n        02:00:00 -> 1.333\n        03:00:00 -> 1.356\n        04:00:00 -> 1.310\n        05:00:00 -> 1.287\n        06:00:00 -> 1.424\n        07:00:00 -> 1.455\n        08:00:00 -> 1.409\n        09:00:00 -> 1.340\n        10:00:00 -> 1.356\n        11:00:00 -> 1.264\n        12:00:00 -> 1.333\n        13:00:00 -> 1.386\n        14:00:00 -> 1.348\n        15:00:00 -> 1.333\n        16:00:00 -> 1.363\n        17:00:00 -> 1.371\n        18:00:00 -> 1.318\n        19:00:00 -> 1.150\n        20:00:00 -> 1.333\n        21:00:00 -> 1.356\n        22:00:00 -> 1.279\n        23:00:00 -> 1.371\n\n     Then repeat the same for the next 3 days (2016-08-03, 2016-08-04, 2016-08-05).\n\n 19. We must generate the dates correctly. The last given date is 2016-08-01 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-08-02 00:00:00.\n\n 20. We write the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 21. We output the data in the required XML-like tags.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-08-02 00:00:00\n     Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n 23. We note that the data for each day will be the same 24 values.\n\n 24. We write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-02 00:00:00 1.424\n2016-08-02 01:00:00 1.325\n2016-08-02 02:00:00 1.333\n... \n2016-08-05 23:00:00 1.371\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 25. But note: the input had the date as index and then a column 'LULL'. We output the same: the date string and then the value.\n\n 26. We must not use any commas, just space separated? The input had:\n\n        \"2016-07-29 00:00:00 1.310\"\n\n     So we output: [date string] [space] [value with 3 decimals]\n\n 27. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     We have 4 days: 2016-08-02, 2016-08-03, 2016-08-04, 2016-08-05.\n\n     For each day, we output 24 lines.\n\n 28. We have the 24 values for one day (as computed above) and we repeat the same for each day.\n\n 29. Let's write the 24 values for one day in a list:\n\n        [1.424, 1.325, 1.333, 1.356, 1.310, 1.287, 1.424, 1.455, 1.409, 1.340, 1.356, 1.264, 1.333, 1.386, 1.348, 1.333, 1.363, 1.371, 1.318, 1.150, 1.333, 1.356, 1.279, 1.371]\n\n 30. Then for 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 31. We generate the dates:\n\n        day1: 2016-08-02\n        day2: 2016-08-03\n        day3: 2016-08-04\n        day4: 2016-08-05\n\n        For each day, we have 24 hours: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We write the data.\n\n 33. We must be cautious: the date format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, with two digits for hour, minute, second. Since it's hourly, minutes and seconds are 00.\n\n 34. We output the data as:\n\n        \"2016-08-02 00:00:00 1.424\"\n        etc.\n\n 35.
