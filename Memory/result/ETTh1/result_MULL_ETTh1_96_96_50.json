        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days (24*4=96).\n\n 3. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the nature of the data (with possible seasonality and trends) and the requirement to handle missing values (though not present in the given 96 points, but we must be robust for the future forecast if needed), we can use an appropriate model.\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need for 96 points forecast, we can consider models like:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) with seasonality (if we can detect a daily seasonality, i.e., 24 hours)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which can capture seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data provided is only 4 days. It might be challenging to capture weekly seasonality, but daily seasonality (24 points) is present.\n\n 6. We will:\n    a. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    b. If non-stationary, we may need to difference the series.\n    c. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (looking at the values, they seem to have a pattern every 24 hours).\n\n 7. Since we are to provide the forecast, we will use a model that can capture the seasonality. We choose the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model.\n\n 8. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We will use auto_arima from pmdarima to find the best parameters (if we are allowed to use it) or we can manually set based on ACF and PACF.\n\n 9. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the given 96 points, there are none. For forecasting, we assume the next 96 points are contiguous and we are to generate 96 points.\n\n 10. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, we must generate the timestamps and the forecasted values.\n\n 11. We will use the last date in the data: 2017-01-20 23:00:00, then the next 96 hours will be from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 12. Implementation:\n\n     We are going to use Python code to model and forecast. But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data in the answer.\n\n     However, since we are in a text-based environment, we cannot run code. Therefore, we must simulate the process.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n        - We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then adjust with a trend.\n\n     But note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a robust method.\n\n     Given the constraints, we will describe the steps we would do and then provide a sample forecast. But the problem requires the complete data.\n\n     However, the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n     We must generate 96 numbers. Since we cannot run code here, we have to rely on a precomputed forecast or a simple method.\n\n     Let me propose:\n\n        We can use a naive seasonal forecast: use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it 4 times? But the data might have a perfect daily pattern? \n\n        Looking at the data:\n\n          Day1: 2017-01-17\n          Day2: 2017-01-18\n          Day3: 2017-01-19\n          Day4: 2017-01-20\n\n        The pattern is not exactly repeating. We see a trend? For example, the values on 2017-01-20 during the day (from 10:00 to 14:00) are positive, which is different.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then project that for the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps for the simple method:\n\n        For hour 0: average of [-0.888, -0.569, -1.421, -1.919] -> (-0.888 -0.569 -1.421 -1.919)/4 = -1.19925\n        For hour 1: average of [-0.569, -0.817, -0.497, -1.848] -> ... \n\n        But note: the last day (2017-01-20) has a different pattern (especially during the day). Also, we are forecasting 4 days, so we can use the same average pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n     However, we note that the problem requires a forecast and we are experts. We should account for possible trend.\n\n     Given the complexity and without being able to run code, we will use a simple method and then adjust for a slight trend.\n\n     But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\", so we have to output 96 numbers.\n\n     We decide to use:\n\n        Step 1: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n        Step 2: Forecast the trend component using a simple linear regression (if there is a trend) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n     However, without running, we can assume:\n\n        We have 4 days of data. We can compute the average daily pattern (by averaging the 4 days for each hour) and then use the last day's trend as a base and project forward with the average daily pattern.\n\n     But this is complex to do by hand for 96 points.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by repeating the last day's pattern (2017-01-20) for the next 4 days? But that might not account for the trend.\n\n     Looking at the last day (2017-01-20) and the previous days, the values on 2017-01-20 during the day (10:00 to 14:00) were higher (less negative) than previous days. So there might be an upward trend? But then in the evening it went down again.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days for each hour? \n\n     Since we are not able to compute exactly, we will use the following approach:\n\n        We will use the average of the four days for each hour of the day to form a base seasonal pattern.\n\n        Then, we note the overall level of the series. The last value is -1.279 (at 2017-01-20 23:00:00). The average of the entire series is about -1.5 (by quick calculation). \n\n        We can adjust the base pattern by the last level. But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n     Given the ambiguity, we will use the average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Let H0, H1, ... H23 be the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n            Day1: H0, H1, ... H23\n            Day2: H0, H1, ... H23\n            Day3: H0, H1, ... H23\n            Day4: H0, H1, ... H23\n\n     We compute the hourly averages:\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): [-0.888, -0.569, -1.421, -1.919] -> (-0.888 -0.569 -1.421 -1.919)/4 = -1.19925\n        Hour 1 (01:00): [-0.569, -0.817, -0.497, -1.848] -> (-0.569 -0.817 -0.497 -1.848)/4 = -0.93275\n        Hour 2 (02:00): [-0.995, -0.533, -1.102, -1.954] -> (-0.995 -0.533 -1.102 -1.954)/4 = -1.146\n        Hour 3 (03:00): [-0.178, -1.421, -0.924, -2.345] -> (-0.178 -1.421 -0.924 -2.345)/4 = -1.217\n        Hour 4 (04:00): [-1.066, -1.208, -1.031, -2.025] -> (-1.066 -1.208 -1.031 -2.025)/4 = -1.3325\n        Hour 5 (05:00): [-0.426, -1.137, -1.208, -1.848] -> (-0.426 -1.137 -1.208 -1.848)/4 = -1.15475\n        Hour 6 (06:00): [-1.173, -1.279, -1.066, -2.097] -> (-1.173 -1.279 -1.066 -2.097)/4 = -1.40375\n        Hour 7 (07:00): [0.320, -0.888, -2.097, -2.665] -> (0.320 -0.888 -2.097 -2.665)/4 = -1.3325\n        Hour 8 (08:00): [0.000, -1.137, -1.492, -1.919] -> (0.000 -1.137 -1.492 -1.919)/4 = -1.137\n        Hour 9 (09:00): [-0.142, -1.919, -0.817, -1.315] -> (-0.142 -1.919 -0.817 -1.315)/4 = -1.04825\n        Hour 10 (10:00): [-1.279, -1.883, -2.061, -0.533] -> (-1.279 -1.883 -2.061 -0.533)/4 = -1.439\n        Hour 11 (11:00): [-1.812, -1.492, -1.812, -0.355] -> (-1.812 -1.492 -1.812 -0.355)/4 = -1.36775\n        Hour 12 (12:00): [-2.061, -1.883, -1.670, -0.284] -> (-2.061 -1.883 -1.670 -0.284)/4 = -1.4745\n        Hour 13 (13:00): [-1.990, -1.350, -1.599, 0.000] -> (-1.990 -1.350 -1.599 +0.000)/4 = -1.23475\n        Hour 14 (14:00): [-1.883, -1.990, -1.990, 0.107] -> (-1.883 -1.990 -1.990 +0.107)/4 = -1.439\n        Hour 15 (15:00): [-1.848, -2.097, -2.097, -1.279] -> (-1.848 -2.097 -2.097 -1.279)/4 = -1.83025\n        Hour 16 (16:00): [-1.492, -2.239, -1.564, -1.919] -> (-1.492 -2.239 -1.564 -1.919)/4 = -1.8035\n        Hour 17 (17:00): [-1.208, -2.132, -1.812, -2.168] -> (-1.208 -2.132 -1.812 -2.168)/4 = -1.830\n        Hour 18 (18:00): [-1.741, -1.954, -1.883, -1.741] -> (-1.741 -1.954 -1.883 -1.741)/4 = -1.82975\n        Hour 19 (19:00): [-1.421, -2.097, -1.599, -1.492] -> (-1.421 -2.097 -1.599 -1.492)/4 = -1.65225\n        Hour 20 (20:00): [-1.741, -2.025, -1.670, -1.421] -> (-1.741 -2.025 -1.670 -1.421)/4 = -1.71425\n        Hour 21 (21:00): [-2.487, -2.949, -1.883, -2.452] -> (-2.487 -2.949 -1.883 -2.452)/4 = -2.44275\n        Hour 22 (22:00): [-1.599, -1.812, -1.883, -0.640] -> (-1.599 -1.812 -1.883 -0.640)/4 = -1.4835\n        Hour 23 (23:00): [-0.782, -1.386, -1.706, -1.279] -> (-0.782 -1.386 -1.706 -1.279)/4 = -1.28825\n\n     Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-21): \n            00:00:00: -1.19925\n            01:00:00: -0.93275\n            02:00:00: -1.146\n            ... until 23:00:00: -1.28825\n\n        Day2 (2017-01-22): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-01-23): same as above\n        Day4 (2017-01-24): same as above\n\n     But note: we are rounding to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n     However, this method ignores any trend.
