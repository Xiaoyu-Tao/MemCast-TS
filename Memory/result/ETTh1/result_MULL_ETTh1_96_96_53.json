        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the dataset may have missing values. \n Since we are only given 96 points without any missing values in this segment, we can proceed to model the next 96 points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and shows a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) and possibly weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days, which is less than a week.\n 2. We can use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the small amount of data, we might use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, or a model that can capture multiple seasonality like TBATS or STL with ETS, but note that we have only 4 days (so 4 seasonal periods of 24) which is very limited for fitting a complex model.\n\n However, note that the problem says the dataset is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given a small segment. We are not given the entire history, so we must work with the 96 points.\n\n 3. We observe that the data for 2017-01-31 is constant (-2.452 for all hours). This might be an anomaly or missing data that has been filled with a constant? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious.\n\n 4. Since we are to forecast the next 96 points, we must provide the complete data without any missing values.\n\n Approach:\n Given the limited data and the presence of a daily pattern (24 hours) and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can try to use a model that uses the daily seasonality.\n\n However, note that the last day (2017-02-01) does not have the constant pattern of 2017-01-31. So we can try:\n\n Option 1: Use the last day (2017-02-01) as the pattern for the next days? But we have 4 days and they are not exactly the same.\n\n Option 2: Use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a seasonal naive model: \n   y_{t+24} = y_{t}   [for one day ahead]\n But we are forecasting 96 steps ahead, so we can use:\n   For the first 24 hours (2017-02-02): use the values of 2017-01-30? or 2017-02-01? \n   Since 2017-01-31 is constant and might be an anomaly, we avoid using it.\n\n Let's look at the last three days:\n   2017-01-30: has a pattern\n   2017-01-31: constant (anomaly)\n   2017-02-01: has a pattern\n\n We might use 2017-02-01 as the base for the next day? But we have to account for the fact that the next day might be similar to the previous non-anomalous days.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the day of the week. We have:\n   2017-01-29: Sunday\n   2017-01-30: Monday\n   2017-01-31: Tuesday\n   2017-02-01: Wednesday\n\n We are to forecast:\n   2017-02-02: Thursday\n   2017-02-03: Friday\n   2017-02-04: Saturday\n   2017-02-05: Sunday\n\n Without more data, it's hard to capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we might assume that the pattern of the most recent non-anomalous day (Wednesday, 2017-02-01) is a good starting point.\n\n But note: the Sunday (2017-01-29) pattern is different from the Wednesday (2017-02-01) pattern.\n\n Since we have only 4 days and one of them is constant, we have only 3 days of real patterns. We can try to average the non-anomalous days? However, the patterns are different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that decomposes the time series and then forecasts the components. But with only 4 days, decomposition might not be stable.\n\n Given the complexity and the limited data, I propose to use the following simple approach:\n\n   - For the next day (2017-02-02, Thursday): use the pattern from the same day of the previous week? But we don't have a Thursday in the data. \n     Actually, we have only 4 days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday (anomaly), Wednesday.\n\n   - Instead, we can use the average of the available days (excluding the constant day) for each hour.\n\n   Steps:\n     Group by hour of the day and average the values for the non-anomalous days (2017-01-29, 2017-01-30, 2017-02-01).\n\n   But note: 2017-01-29 is Sunday, 2017-01-30 is Monday, 2017-02-01 is Wednesday. They are different days of the week.\n\n   Without more data, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we might ignore the day of the week and just average the three days.\n\n   However, we note that the pattern on Sunday (2017-01-29) and Wednesday (2017-02-01) are somewhat similar? Let's compare:\n\n        Hour 0: \n          2017-01-29: -2.843\n          2017-01-30: -2.807\n          2017-02-01: -2.487\n        Hour 1:\n          2017-01-29: -2.807\n          2017-01-30: -2.843\n          2017-02-01: -2.630\n\n   They are not exactly the same. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the most recent day (2017-02-01) as the pattern for the next day (2017-02-02) and then for the subsequent days, we can use the same pattern? \n   But that would ignore the weekly pattern. However, we don't have enough data to model weekly pattern.\n\n   Considering the above, I decide to:\n\n   - For the first 24 hours (2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-02 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-02-01 (the day before) but adjusted by the average change from the previous day? \n     But we don't have a trend.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal forecast: \n        Forecast for 2017-02-02 00:00:00 = value of 2017-02-01 00:00:00\n        ... until 2017-02-02 23:00:00 = value of 2017-02-01 23:00:00\n\n   - Then for the next day (2017-02-03), we can use the same pattern as 2017-02-01? But that would be the same as 2017-02-02? \n\n   We need 96 hours. We can do:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-02): use the pattern of 2017-02-01 (the last available day)\n        Day2 (2017-02-03): use the pattern of 2017-01-30 (Monday, but we don't have a Friday) -> but we don't have a Friday. \n        Instead, we can use the average of the three non-anomalous days for each hour? \n\n   Let me create a table of the non-anomalous days:\n\n        Hour | 2017-01-29 (Sun) | 2017-01-30 (Mon) | 2017-02-01 (Wed) | Average\n        0    | -2.843          | -2.807           | -2.487           | (-2.843 -2.807 -2.487)/3 = -2.712\n        1    | -2.807          | -2.843           | -2.630           | (-2.807 -2.843 -2.630)/3 = -2.760\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then we can use:\n        Day1 (2017-02-02): the average for each hour\n        Day2 (2017-02-03): the average for each hour\n        Day3 (2017-02-04): the average for each hour\n        Day4 (2017-02-05): the average for each hour\n\n   But note: 2017-02-05 is Sunday, so it might be more similar to 2017-01-29? But we don't have enough data to confirm.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average for the first two days and then for the weekend use the Sunday pattern? But we only have one Sunday.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, I choose to use the average of the three non-anomalous days for each hour for the entire 4 days.\n\n   Steps for averaging:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23):\n            value = (value on 2017-01-29 at hour h + value on 2017-01-30 at hour h + value on 2017-02-01 at hour h) / 3\n\n        Then for each day in the forecast period (4 days), at hour h, we use the computed average for that hour.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2017-01-31 is constant and we are excluding it.\n\n   But let's check: the last day we have is 2017-02-01, and we are forecasting starting 2017-02-02.\n\n   We must generate 96 points.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        date from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00\n\n        For each hour in [0,23] for each of the 4 days, we assign the average value for that hour.\n\n   Example for hour 0:\n\n        dates: 2017-02-02 00:00:00, 2017-02-03 00:00:00, 2017-02-04 00:00:00, 2017-02-05 00:00:00\n        all will be set to: (-2.843 + -2.807 + -2.487) / 3 = -2.712333...\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the data on 2017-01-31 is constant) is excluded.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the average might smooth out the pattern and not capture the most recent trend. But with only 3 days and no clear trend, it is a safe approach.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? But the average is acceptable.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (-2.843 -2.807 -2.487)/3 = -2.712\n        Hour 1: (-2.807 -2.843 -2.630)/3 = -2.760\n        Hour 2: (-2.843 -2.914 -2.701)/3 = -2.819\n        Hour 3: (-2.949 -2.949 -2.807)/3 = -2.902\n        Hour 4: (-2.914 -2.949 -2.807)/3 = -2.890\n        Hour 5: (-2.914 -2.985 -2.807)/3 = -2.902\n        Hour 6: (-2.878 -2.949 -2.736)/3 = -2.854\n        Hour 7: (-2.843 -2.807 -2.736)/3 = -2.795\n        Hour 8: (-2.345 -2.061 -2.274)/3 = -2.227\n        Hour 9: (-2.487 -2.203 -2.310)/3 = -2.333\n        Hour 10: (-2.416 -1.741 -2.345)/3 = -2.167\n        Hour 11: (-2.736 -1.031 -2.345)/3 = -2.037\n        Hour 12: (-2.736 -0.853 -2.310)/3 = -1.966\n        Hour 13: (-2.594 -0.497 -2.274)/3 = -1.788\n        Hour 14: (-2.559 -1.386 -2.274)/3 = -2.073\n        Hour 15: (-2.523 -1.386 -2.274)/3 = -2.061\n        Hour 16: (-2.630 -1.954 -2.132)/3 = -2.239\n        Hour 17: (-2.985 -2.594 -2.239)/3 = -2.606\n        Hour 18: (-2.274 -2.381 -2.559)/3 = -2.405\n        Hour 19: (-1.990 -1.670 -1.741)/3 = -1.800\n        Hour 20: (-1.954 -1.564 -1.706)/3 = -1.741\n        Hour 21: (-2.061 -1.528 -1.564)/3 = -1.718\n        Hour 22: (-2.168 -1.954 -1.848)/3 = -1.990\n        Hour 23: (-2.381 -2.239 -2.203)/3 = -2.274\n\n   Then for the forecast period, each day will have the same 24 values as above.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are generating without missing values.\n\n   However, this approach ignores any trend and the fact that the weekend might be different. But with the data we have, it's the best we can do.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) but with only 4 days (and one being constant) it might not be robust.\n\n   Therefore, I will output the forecast as 4 days of the same 24-hour average pattern computed above.\n\n   The dates:\n\n        2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-02 23:00:00: the 24 values above\n        2017-02-03 00:00:00 to 2017-02-03 23:00:00: the same 24 values\n        2017-02-04 00:00:00 to 2017-02-04 23:00:00: the same 24 values\n        2017-02-05 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00: the same 24 values\n\n   We must generate 96 rows.\n\n   Let's write the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-02 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-02-05 23:00:00\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        date = []\n        value = []\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = 2017-02-02 + day days at hour\n                value = the average for that hour (as above)\n\n   We must be careful: 2017 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days.\n\n   Format: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We'll output the data in the same format as the input.\n\n   Example for the first few:\n\n        2017-02-02 00:00:00, -2.712\n        2017-02-02 01:00:00, -2.760\n        ...\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the average we computed might have more decimals, so we round to 3.\n\n   Let me recalc to 3 decimals:\n\n        Hour0: -2.712\n        Hour1: -2.760\n        Hour2: -2.819\n        -2.843 -2.914 -2.701 = (-2.843-2.914-2.701)/3 = -8.458/3 = -2.819333 -> -2.819\n        Hour3: (-2.949-2.949-2.807)= -8.705/3 = -2.901666 -> -2.902\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll use the rounded values as above.\n\n   But note: the original data had 3 decimals, so we output 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll create the list of 96 points.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's code the values for each hour:\n\n        h0: -2.712\n        h1: -2.760\n        h2: -2.819\n        h3: -2.902\n        h4: -2.890\n        h5: -2.902\n        h6: -2.854\n        h7: -2.795\n        h8: -2.227\n        h9: -2.333\n        h10: -2.167\n        h11: -2.037\n        h12: -1.966\n        h13: -1.788\n        h14: -2.073\n        h15: -2.061\n        h16: -2.239\n        h17: -2.606\n        h18: -2.405\n        h19: -1.800\n        h20: -1.741\n        h21: -1.718\n        h22: -1.990\n        h23: -2.274\n\n   Now, we'll generate 4 days of these 24 values.\n\n   We write the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-02\n        Day2: 2017-02-03\n        Day3: 2017-02-04\n        Day4: 2017-02-05\n\n   We must be careful: the next day after 2017-02-01 is 2017-02-02.\n\n   We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n2017-02-02 00:00:00,-2.712\n2017-02-02 01:00:00,-2.760\n2017-02-02 02:00:00,-2.819\n2017-02-02 03:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-02 04:00:00,-2.890\n2017-02-02 05:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-02 06:00:00,-2.854\n2017-02-02 07:00:00,-2.795\n2017-02-02 08:00:00,-2.227\n2017-02-02 09:00:00,-2.333\n2017-02-02 10:00:00,-2.167\n2017-02-02 11:00:00,-2.037\n2017-02-02 12:00:00,-1.966\n2017-02-02 13:00:00,-1.788\n2017-02-02 14:00:00,-2.073\n2017-02-02 15:00:00,-2.061\n2017-02-02 16:00:00,-2.239\n2017-02-02 17:00:00,-2.606\n2017-02-02 18:00:00,-2.405\n2017-02-02 19:00:00,-1.800\n2017-02-02 20:00:00,-1.741\n2017-02-02 21:00:00,-1.718\n2017-02-02 22:00:00,-1.990\n2017-02-02 23:00:00,-2.274\n2017-02-03 00:00:00,-2.712\n2017-02-03 01:00:00,-2.760\n2017-02-03 02:00:00,-2.819\n2017-02-03 03:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-03 04:00:00,-2.890\n2017-02-03 05:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-03 06:00:00,-2.854\n2017-02-03 07:00:00,-2.795\n2017-02-03 08:00:00,-2.227\n2017-02-03 09:00:00,-2.333\n2017-02-03 10:00:00,-2.167\n2017-02-03 11:00:00,-2.037\n2017-02-03 12:00:00,-1.966\n2017-02-03 13:00:00,-1.788\n2017-02-03 14:00:00,-2.073\n2017-02-03 15:00:00,-2.061\n2017-02-03 16:00:00,-2.239\n2017-02-03 17:00:00,-2.606\n2017-02-03 18:00:00,-2.405\n2017-02-03 19:00:00,-1.800\n2017-02-03 20:00:00,-1.741\n2017-02-03 21:00:00,-1.718\n2017-02-03 22:00:00,-1.990\n2017-02-03 23:00:00,-2.274\n2017-02-04 00:00:00,-2.712\n2017-02-04 01:00:00,-2.760\n2017-02-04 02:00:00,-2.819\n2017-02-04 03:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-04 04:00:00,-2.890\n2017-02-04 05:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-04 06:00:00,-2.854\n2017-02-04 07:00:00,-2.795\n2017-02-04 08:00:00,-2.227\n2017-02-04 09:00:00,-2.333\n2017-02-04 10:00:00,-2.167\n2017-02-04 11:00:00,-2.037\n2017-02-04 12:00:00,-1.966\n2017-02-04 13:00:00,-1.788\n2017-02-04 14:00:00,-2.073\n2017-02-04 15:00:00,-2.061\n2017-02-04 16:00:00,-2.239\n2017-02-04 17:00:00,-2.606\n2017-02-04 18:00:00,-2.405\n2017-02-04 19:00:00,-1.800\n2017-02-04 20:00:00,-1.741\n2017-02-04 21:00:00,-1.718\n2017-02-04 22:00:00,-1.990\n2017-02-04 23:00:00,-2.274\n2017-02-05 00:00:00,-2.712\n2017-02-05 01:00:00,-2.760\n2017-02-05 02:00:00,-2.819\n2017-02-05 03:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-05 04:00:00,-2.890\n2017-02-05 05:00:00,-2.902\n2017-02-05 06:00:00,-2.854\n2017-02-05 07:00:00,-2.795\n2017-02-05 08:00:00,-2.227\n2017-02-05 09:00:00,-2.333\n2017-02-05 10:00:00,-2.167\n2017-02-05 11:00:00,-2.037\n2017-02-05 12:00:00,-1.966\n2017-02-05 13:00:00,-1.788\n2017-02-05 14:00:00,-2.073\n2017-02-05 15:00:00,-2.061\n2017-02-05 16:00:00,-2.239\n2017-02-05 17:00:00,-2.606\n2017-02-05 18:00:00,-2.405\n2017-02-05 19:00:00,-1.800\n2017-02-05 20:00:00,-1.741\n2017-02-05 21:00:00,-1.718\n2017-02-05 22:00:00,-1.990\n2017-02-05 23:00:00,-2.274\n\n   But note: the original data had the column name \"MULL\", but the problem does not require the header?
