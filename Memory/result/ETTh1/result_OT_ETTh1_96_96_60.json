        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there are missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data seems complete for 96 points? \n    However, we are to be aware of missing values. Since the provided data is complete, we assume the missing values might be in the future? But the instruction says the data for the past 96 recorded dates (which we have) and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 2. We must handle the time series forecasting. Given the nature of the data (temperature in a transformer) and the hourly pattern, we can expect:\n    - Seasonality: daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly? But we have only 4 days of data, so weekly seasonality might not be captured. We'll focus on daily.\n\n 3. We are to provide the next 96 points. We must output in the same format: two columns (date and OT) for 96 consecutive hours starting from the next timestamp after 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n\n 4. Since the data is short (only 96 points) and we are to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that can handle short time series and seasonality.\n\n 5. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern: temperatures drop during the night and rise during the day.\n\n 6. We can use a simple seasonal model. One common approach is to use the seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the day by the last observed value at the same hour of the day.\n\n    However, we have 4 days of data. We can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But note: the data starts at 2017-02-26 (Sunday) and ends at 2017-03-01 (Wednesday). \n    We have 4 days: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. But with only 4 days, the seasonal period of 24 might be too long for the data.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can try to use the average of the same hour over the available days. But note: the pattern might change from Sunday to Wednesday? \n\n    However, the problem does not provide any external variables (like load) so we rely solely on the OT history.\n\n 8. Another idea: use a moving window of the last few days. Since we have 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days.\n\n    For example, to forecast the temperature at 00:00 on 2017-03-02, we take the average of:\n        2017-02-26 00:00:00 -> 11.467\n        2017-02-27 00:00:00 -> 10.904\n        2017-02-28 00:00:00 -> 9.567\n        2017-03-01 00:00:00 -> 12.733\n\n    Then the forecast for 2017-03-02 00:00:00 would be (11.467+10.904+9.567+12.733)/4 = 11.16775.\n\n    Similarly, for 01:00: \n        2017-02-26 01:00:00 -> 11.044\n        2017-02-27 01:00:00 -> 10.974\n        2017-02-28 01:00:00 -> 9.567\n        2017-03-01 01:00:00 -> 11.889\n        Average = (11.044+10.974+9.567+11.889)/4 = 10.8685\n\n    And so on.\n\n 9. But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-02-26): min ~9.778, max ~13.929\n        Day 2 (2017-02-27): min ~7.809, max ~14.703\n        Day 3 (2017-02-28): min ~7.809, max ~14.703\n        Day 4 (2017-03-01): min ~6.613, max ~12.803\n\n    There is a drop on the last day? But we are to forecast the next 4 days. Without a clear trend, we might assume the level is the average of the last few days.\n\n10. Alternatively, we can use a model that automatically captures the level and seasonality. Since we are limited by the data length, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n11. However, note that the last day (2017-03-01) has a drop in the maximum temperature. This might be due to a change in load or external factors. But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n12. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n    Start: 2017-03-02 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-03-05 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 = 96 hours).\n\n13. For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 available days.\n\n    Let H be the hour (0 to 23). We have 4 observations for each H: from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n    Then the forecast for hour H of any future day is the average of the 4 past observations at hour H.\n\n14. But note: what if there is a trend? We could also consider using only the last two days? However, the problem does not specify. We'll use the 4-day average.\n\n15. However, we must be cautious: the data on 2017-03-01 is lower than the previous days. This might indicate a downward trend? But we have only 4 days. We'll stick to the average.\n\n16. Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n    a) Create a list of the next 96 timestamps, starting from 2017-03-02 00:00:00, then 2017-03-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-05 23:00:00.\n\n    b) For each timestamp, extract the hour (0 to 23).\n\n    c) For a given hour H, the forecasted value is the average of the OT values at hour H from the 4 days we have.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        dates: 2017-02-26 00:00:00 -> 11.467\n               2017-02-27 00:00:00 -> 10.904\n               2017-02-28 00:00:00 -> 9.567\n               2017-03-01 00:00:00 -> 12.733\n        average = (11.467 + 10.904 + 9.567 + 12.733) / 4 = 11.16775\n\n    Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        2017-02-26 01:00:00 -> 11.044\n        2017-02-27 01:00:00 -> 10.974\n        2017-02-28 01:00:00 -> 9.567\n        2017-03-01 01:00:00 -> 11.889\n        average = (11.044 + 10.974 + 9.567 + 11.889) / 4 = 10.8685\n\n    And so on.\n\n17. We do this for each of the 24 hours. Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat the same 24-hour pattern? \n\n    Actually, we are using the same set of averages for each day in the forecast horizon. So:\n\n        Day 1 of forecast (2017-03-02): hour0: 11.16775, hour1: 10.8685, ... hour23: (average of the 4 days at 23:00)\n        Day 2 (2017-03-03): same pattern: hour0: 11.16775, ... \n        Day 3 (2017-03-04): same\n        Day 4 (2017-03-05): same\n\n    This is a constant seasonal pattern.\n\n18. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't capturing it. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to model a trend. \n\n19. Alternatively, we could use a model that uses the last available day (2017-03-01) as the base and then adjusts by the average seasonal factor? But that might be more complex.\n\n20. Given the simplicity and the data, we'll go with the 4-day average for each hour.\n\n21. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n    We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n    Steps for computation:\n\n        For hour in 0..23:\n            values = []\n            For each day in [0,1,2,3] (which correspond to 2017-02-26, 2017-02-27, 2017-02-28, 2017-03-01):\n                index = day*24 + hour\n                values.append(OT[index])\n            hourly_avg[hour] = sum(values) / 4\n\n22. Then for the forecast:\n\n        For day in 0..3 (for the 4 days: 2017-03-02 to 2017-03-05)\n            For hour in 0..23:\n                timestamp = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                OT_forecast = hourly_avg[hour]\n\n23. The start_date for forecast is 2017-03-02 00:00:00.\n\n24. We must output the data in the same format: two columns, with the string representation of the timestamp and the OT value rounded to 3 decimal places (as in the input).\n\n25. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (11.467 + 10.904 + 9.567 + 12.733) / 4 = 11.16775 -> 11.168\n    Hour 1: (11.044 + 10.974 + 9.567 + 11.889) / 4 = 10.8685 -> 10.869\n    Hour 2: (11.326 + 10.833 + 9.004 + 11.467) / 4 = 10.6575 -> 10.658\n    Hour 3: (10.763 + 10.341 + 9.075 + 12.029) / 4 = 10.552 -> 10.552\n    Hour 4: (10.904 + 10.341 + 8.582 + 12.803) / 4 = 10.6575 -> 10.658\n    Hour 5: (10.200 + 9.778 + 8.231 + 12.592) / 4 = 10.20025 -> 10.200\n    Hour 6: (9.778 + 9.215 + 8.301 + 10.341) / 4 = 9.40875 -> 9.409\n    Hour 7: (9.849 + 8.442 + 8.020 + 8.582) / 4 = 8.72325 -> 8.723\n    Hour 8: (10.622 + 9.215 + 8.653 + 8.442) / 4 = 9.233 -> 9.233\n    Hour 9: (12.240 + 8.723 + 7.809 + 8.653) / 4 = 9.35625 -> 9.356\n    Hour 10: (11.326 + 9.004 + 9.356 + 9.004) / 4 = 9.6725 -> 9.673\n    Hour 11: (12.311 + 10.130 + 10.482 + 9.215) / 4 = 10.5345 -> 10.535\n    Hour 12: (11.889 + 11.115 + 11.185 + 8.864) / 4 = 10.76325 -> 10.763\n    Hour 13: (12.029 + 12.170 + 11.678 + 9.426) / 4 = 11.32575 -> 11.326\n    Hour 14: (13.296 + 14.491 + 13.999 + 9.356) / 4 = 12.7855 -> 12.786\n    Hour 15: (13.929 + 14.351 + 14.703 + 8.653) / 4 = 12.909 -> 12.909\n    Hour 16: (12.803 + 14.703 + 14.351 + 9.286) / 4 = 12.78575 -> 12.786\n    Hour 17: (12.662 + 13.647 + 14.351 + 9.004) / 4 = 12.416 -> 12.416\n    Hour 18: (13.085 + 13.718 + 13.155 + 8.020) / 4 = 11.9945 -> 11.995\n    Hour 19: (12.029 + 12.803 + 12.522 + 8.934) / 4 = 11.572 -> 11.572\n    Hour 20: (10.974 + 11.607 + 12.029 + 8.512) / 4 = 10.7805 -> 10.781\n    Hour 21: (10.904 + 11.678 + 12.874 + 6.613) / 4 = 10.51725 -> 10.517\n    Hour 22: (11.467 + 10.130 + 13.085 + 7.668) / 4 = 10.5875 -> 10.588\n    Hour 23: (11.396 + 9.497 + 13.155 + 7.668) / 4 = 10.429 -> 10.429\n\n    Note: We are rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n26. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-03-02 00:00:00 -> 11.168\n           2017-03-02 01:00:00 -> 10.869\n           ... until 2017-03-02 23:00:00 -> 10.429\n\n    Day 2: 2017-03-03 00:00:00 -> 11.168\n           ... same as day1\n\n    Day 3: same pattern\n    Day 4: same pattern\n\n27. We write the data in the required format.\n\n28. However, note: the user said the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing. We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n29. We output the data in the exact format.\n\n Let's code the generation:\n\n    Start date: 2017-03-02 00:00:00\n    End date: 2017-03-05 23:00:00\n\n    We'll create a list of 96 timestamps.\n\n    The OT values for each hour of the day (0-23) are in the list `hourly_avg` (which we computed above, rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n    Then for i in range(96):\n        day_index = i // 24   # 0,1,2,3\n        hour_index = i % 24\n        date = start_date + timedelta(days=day_index, hours=hour_index)\n\n    But note: the start_date is 2017-03-02 00:00:00.\n\n30. We must format the date as string: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n31. We output in the same format as the input.\n\n32. We write the data in the answer block.\n\n33. We note: the provided data ends at 2017-03-01 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-03-02 00:00:00.\n\n34. Let's generate the forecast data:\n\n    We have the 24 hourly averages (computed above) as:\n\n    hourly_avg = [\n        11.168,  # 0\n        10.869,  # 1\n        10.658,  # 2\n        10.552,  # 3\n        10.658,  # 4\n        10.200,  # 5\n        9.409,   # 6\n        8.723,   # 7\n        9.233,   # 8\n        9.356,   # 9\n        9.673,   # 10\n        10.535,  # 11\n        10.763,  # 12\n        11.326,  # 13\n        12.786,  # 14\n        12.909,  # 15\n        12.786,  # 16\n        12.416,  # 17\n        11.995,  # 18\n        11.572,  # 19\n        10.781,  # 20\n        10.517,  # 21\n        10.588,  # 22\n        10.429   # 23\n    ]\n\n    But note: we computed these by hand and rounded. We should use the exact average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n    Let me recalculate with more precision and then round:\n\n    We'll create a table:\n\n    Hour 0: (11.467 + 10.904 + 9.567 + 12.733) = 44.671 -> 44.671/4 = 11.16775 -> round to 3 decimals: 11.168\n    Hour 1: (11.044+10.974+9.567+11.889)=43.474 -> 43.474/4=10.8685 -> 10.869\n    because 10.8685 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 10.869)\n\n    Similarly, we do for all.\n\n    We'll use the rounded values as above.\n\n35.
