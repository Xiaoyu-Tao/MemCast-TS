        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can consider:\n    - ARIMA/SARIMA: to capture potential seasonality. Since the data is hourly, we might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly pattern is not visible.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) for seasonality.\n    - Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 steps (4 days) forecast, we can try to capture daily seasonality.\n\n 3. Observing the data: \n    - The data seems to have a daily pattern. For example, on 2017-09-26, we see negative values in the evening (around 18:00 to 22:00) and positive in the day. \n    - The pattern is not very clear, but we can see that the values at the same hour of the day might be similar.\n\n 4. Since we have only 4 days, we can use a seasonal model with a period of 24.\n\n 5. We will use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,s) where s=24.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might be non-stationary. We might need to difference the data to make it stationary.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: a seasonal naive forecast, which uses the value from the same time in the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? Or use the last day (2017-09-29) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n 8. But the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are to forecast the next 96. We must be cautious.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we can try to use a moving average or exponential smoothing method that accounts for seasonality.\n\n 10. We choose to use the Holt-Winters seasonal method. Since the data does not show a clear trend (it seems stationary in the mean but with seasonality), we can use additive seasonality.\n\n 11. Steps for Holt-Winters (Additive):\n     - We have level, trend, and seasonal components.\n     - We set seasonality to 24.\n\n 12. However, with only 4 days (96 points) and seasonality of 24, we have only 4 seasonal cycles. This is minimal but acceptable.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal model: average the same hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 14. Let's do:\n     For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, the forecast for the next 4 days (from day 5 to day 8) at hour h will be the average of the same hour h from the 4 available days.\n\n 15. But note: the data from 2017-09-26 to 2017-09-29 (4 days). Then the next 4 days: 2017-09-30, 2017-10-01, 2017-10-02, 2017-10-03.\n\n 16. We can compute:\n     Let D1 = 2017-09-26, D2=2017-09-27, D3=2017-09-28, D4=2017-09-29.\n\n     For hour h (0 to 23) in the next days:\n        Forecast for 2017-09-30 h: average of (D1_h, D2_h, D3_h, D4_h)\n        Similarly for 2017-10-01 h: same average? \n        But that would be a constant pattern for each day? \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (D4) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be a naive forecast and we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n 18. Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are limited by the data, we choose the average by hour over the 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps:\n      - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n      - For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n      Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will assign:\n          Day1 (2017-09-30): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n          Day2 (2017-10-01): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n          Day3 (2017-10-02): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n          Day4 (2017-10-03): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n\n 20. This method is simple and captures the daily pattern by averaging out the noise.\n\n 21. Let's compute the mean for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: (1.072, -0.067, -0.268, -1.005) -> (1.072 -0.067 -0.268 -1.005)/4 = (-0.268)/4 = -0.067\n      But let me calculate each hour:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the mean.\n\n 22. However, note that the data we have is for 4 days. We can use pandas to group by hour.\n\n 23. But since we are to output the data, we can do:\n\n      hour0 = [1.072, -0.067, -0.268, -1.005] -> mean = (1.072 -0.067 -0.268 -1.005)/4 = (1.072 - 1.34) = -0.268 -> -0.268/4 = -0.067? Actually:\n\n        1.072 -0.067 = 1.005\n        1.005 -0.268 = 0.737\n        0.737 -1.005 = -0.268\n        Then -0.268 / 4 = -0.067\n\n      Similarly, we do for all.\n\n 24. But note: the data for the same hour might vary, and averaging might smooth it.\n\n 25. We'll compute the mean for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 26. However, we must be cautious: the last day (2017-09-29) at hour 23 is 1.474, which is an outlier? But we are taking average.\n\n 27. Let me do the calculation for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: [1.072, -0.067, -0.268, -1.005] -> mean = (1.072 -0.067 -0.268 -1.005)/4 = (-0.268)/4 = -0.067\n\n      Actually: 1.072 + (-0.067) = 1.005; then 1.005 + (-0.268) = 0.737; then 0.737 + (-1.005) = -0.268; then -0.268/4 = -0.067.\n\n      We can do:\n\n        hour0 = (1.072 -0.067 -0.268 -1.005) / 4 = (1.072 - 1.34) = -0.268 -> then divided by 4 -> -0.067.\n\n      But let me calculate numerically:\n\n        1.072 -0.067 = 1.005\n        1.005 -0.268 = 0.737\n        0.737 -1.005 = -0.268\n        -0.268 / 4 = -0.067\n\n      So hour0: -0.067\n\n      Hour 1: [1.340, -0.469, -0.603, -1.206] \n        1.340 -0.469 = 0.871\n        0.871 -0.603 = 0.268\n        0.268 -1.206 = -0.938\n        -0.938 / 4 = -0.2345\n\n      We'll do similarly for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. But note: we are to forecast 4 days, so we will use the same 24 means for each day.\n\n 29. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-30 00:00:00 (next after 2017-09-29 23:00:00)\n      Then 2017-09-30 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-03 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll create a list of 96 values: \n        day1: [mean0, mean1, ... mean23]\n        day2: [mean0, mean1, ... mean23]\n        day3: [mean0, mean1, ... mean23]\n        day4: [mean0, mean1, ... mean23]\n\n 31. We must compute the 24 means from the provided 4 days.\n\n 32. Let's compute the data by hour:\n\n      We have 4 days? Actually 4 days of 24 hours -> 96 points.\n\n      We can group by the hour index (0 to 23) and take the mean.\n\n 33. We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and then for each day we have a value.\n\n 34. Steps for computation:\n\n      hours = {}\n      for i in range(0, 96):\n          hour_of_day = i % 24\n          value = data[i]\n          append value to hours[hour_of_day]\n\n      Then for each hour in 0..23: mean = sum(hours[hour]) / 4\n\n 35. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n      for day in range(0,4):\n          for hour in range(0,24):\n              value = start_date + day*24 + hour\n              where start_date is 2017-09-30 00:00:00\n\n 36. We'll compute the 24 means.\n\n 37. Given the data, we can do:\n\n      Day1: 2017-09-26: indices 0 to 23\n      Day2: 2017-09-27: indices 24 to 47\n      Day3: 2017-09-28: indices 48 to 71\n      Day4: 2017-09-29: indices 72 to 95\n\n 38. Let me extract the values for each hour:\n\n      Hour0: index0: 1.072, index24: -0.067, index48: -0.268, index72: -1.005 -> mean = (1.072 -0.067 -0.268 -1.005)/4 = (-0.268)/4 = -0.067\n\n      Hour1: index1: 1.340, index25: -0.469, index49: -0.603, index73: -1.206 -> (1.340 -0.469 -0.603 -1.206) = (1.340 -0.469)=0.871; 0.871-0.603=0.268; 0.268-1.206=-0.938 -> -0.938/4 = -0.2345\n\n      Hour2: index2: 1.541, index26: -0.335, index50: -0.737, index74: -1.340 -> (1.541 -0.335 -0.737 -1.340) = (1.541-0.335)=1.206; 1.206-0.737=0.469; 0.469-1.340=-0.871 -> -0.871/4 = -0.21775\n\n      Hour3: index3: 0.134, index27: -0.603, index51: 0.067, index75: -1.340 -> (0.134 -0.603 +0.067 -1.340) = (0.134+0.067)=0.201; (-0.603-1.340)=-1.943; 0.201-1.943 = -1.742 -> -1.742/4 = -0.4355\n\n      Hour4: index4: 1.005, index28: -1.474, index52: -0.335, index76: -1.340 -> (1.005 -1.474 -0.335 -1.340) = (1.005) - (1.474+0.335+1.340)= 1.005 - 3.149 = -2.144 -> -2.144/4 = -0.536\n\n      Hour5: index5: 0.737, index29: -0.737, index53: -0.402, index77: -1.273 -> (0.737 -0.737 -0.402 -1.273) = (0.737-0.737)=0; 0-0.402=-0.402; -0.402-1.273=-1.675 -> -1.675/4 = -0.41875\n\n      Hour6: index6: -0.201, index30: -0.670, index54: -1.139, index78: -1.273 -> (-0.201 -0.670 -1.139 -1.273) = - (0.201+0.670+1.139+1.273) = -3.283 -> -3.283/4 = -0.82075\n\n      Hour7: index7: 1.005, index31: -1.005, index55: -0.938, index79: -1.072 -> (1.005 -1.005 -0.938 -1.072) = (0) - (0.938+1.072) = -2.010 -> -2.010/4 = -0.5025\n\n      Hour8: index8: 1.273, index32: -0.536, index56: -0.603, index80: -0.938 -> (1.273 -0.536 -0.603 -0.938) = (1.273) - (0.536+0.603+0.938)=1.273-2.077 = -0.804 -> -0.804/4 = -0.201\n\n      Hour9: index9: 0.000, index33: -0.670, index57: -0.670, index81: -0.402 -> (0.000 -0.670 -0.670 -0.402) = -1.742 -> -1.742/4 = -0.4355\n\n      Hour10: index10: 0.201, index34: -0.804, index58: -0.335, index82: -0.134 -> (0.201 -0.804 -0.335 -0.134) = (0.201) - (0.804+0.335+0.134)=0.201-1.273 = -1.072 -> -1.072/4 = -0.268\n\n      Hour11: index11: 0.670, index35: -0.536, index59: -0.268, index83: 0.268 -> (0.670 -0.536 -0.268 +0.268) = (0.670) + (-0.536) + (-0.268+0.268)=0.134 + 0 = 0.134 -> 0.134/4 = 0.0335\n\n      Hour12: index12: 2.344, index36: -2.813, index60: 3.081, index84: -0.067 -> (2.344 -2.813 +3.081 -0.067) = (2.344+3.081)=5.425; (-2.813-0.067)=-2.88; 5.425-2.88=2.545 -> 2.545/4 = 0.63625\n\n      Hour13: index13: 0.000, index37: -2.344, index61: 3.818, index85: -0.469 -> (0.000 -2.344 +3.818 -0.469) = (0+3.818)=3.818; (-2.344-0.469)=-2.813; 3.818-2.813=1.005 -> 1.005/4 = 0.25125\n\n      Hour14: index14: -0.201, index38: -1.474, index62: 3.952, index86: -0.335 -> (-0.201 -1.474 +3.952 -0.335) = (-0.201-1.474-0.335)= -2.010; +3.952 -> 3.952-2.010=1.942 -> 1.942/4 = 0.4855\n\n      Hour15: index15: 1.541, index39: -2.277, index63: 1.875, index87: -0.938 -> (1.541 -2.277 +1.875 -0.938) = (1.541+1.875)=3.416; (-2.277-0.938)=-3.215; 3.416-3.215=0.201 -> 0.201/4 = 0.05025\n\n      Hour16: index16: 0.000, index40: -3.081, index64: 0.335, index88: -1.206 -> (0.000 -3.081 +0.335 -1.206) = (0.335) - (3.081+1.206)=0.335-4.287=-3.952 -> -3.952/4 = -0.988\n\n      Hour17: index17: -0.670, index41: -3.416, index65: -0.871, index89: -1.206 -> (-0.670 -3.416 -0.871 -1.206) = - (0.670+3.416+0.871+1.206) = -6.163 -> -6.163/4 = -1.54075\n\n      Hour18: index18: -3.215, index42: -3.818, index66: -1.474, index90: -1.474 -> (-3.215 -3.818 -1.474 -1.474) = - (3.215+3.818+1.474+1.474) = -9.981 -> -9.981/4 = -2.49525\n\n      Hour19: index19: -3.282, index43: -3.885, index67: -1.072, index91: -1.407 -> (-3.282 -3.885 -1.072 -1.407) = - (3.282+3.885+1.072+1.407) = -9.646 -> -9.646/4 = -2.4115\n\n      Hour20: index20: -3.349, index44: -3.952, index68: -1.072, index92: -0.670 -> (-3.349 -3.952 -1.072 -0.670) = - (3.349+3.952+1.072+0.670) = -9.043 -> -9.043/4 = -2.26075\n\n      Hour21: index21: -3.148, index45: -3.751, index69: -1.139, index93: -0.268 -> (-3.148 -3.751 -1.139 -0.268) = - (3.148+3.751+1.139+0.268) = -8.306 -> -8.306/4 = -2.0765\n\n      Hour22: index22: -1.608, index46: -2.478, index70: -1.273, index94: 0.201 -> (-1.608 -2.478 -1.273 +0.201) = (-1.608-2.478-1.273)= -5.359; +0.201 -> -5.158 -> -5.158/4 = -1.2895\n\n      Hour23: index23: -0.335, index47: -0.268, index71: -1.139, index95: 1.474 -> (-0.335 -0.268 -1.139 +1.474) = (-0.335-0.268-1.139)= -1.742; +1.474 -> -0.268 -> -0.268/4 = -0.067\n\n 39.

The data:\n\n      Day1 (2017-09-30): \n          00:00:00 -> -0.067\n          01:00:00 -> -0.2345\n          02:00:00 -> -0.21775\n          03:00:00 -> -0.4355\n          04:00:00 -> -0.536\n          05:00:00 -> -0.41875\n          06:00:00 -> -0.82075\n          07:00:00 -> -0.5025\n          08:00:00 -> -0.201\n          09:00:00 -> -0.4355\n          10:00:00 -> -0.268\n          11:00:00 -> 0.0335\n          12:00:00 -> 0.63625\n          13:00:00 -> 0.25125\n          14:00:00 -> 0.4855\n          15:00:00 -> 0.05025\n          16:00:00 -> -0.988\n          17:00:00 -> -1.54075\n          18:00:00 -> -2.49525\n          19:00:00 -> -2.4115\n          20:00:00 -> -2.26075\n          21:00:00 -> -2.0765\n          22:00:00 -> -1.2895\n          23:00:00 -> -0.067\n\n      Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 43. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: date and HULL.\n\n 44. We'll generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-30 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-09-30 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-03 23:00:00.\n\n 45. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 46. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-30 00:00:00  -0.067\n2017-09-30 01:00:00  -0.2345\n...\n2017-10-03 23:00:00  -0.067\n```\n\n 47. We must be cautious: the numbers we computed are the means, but we have many decimal places. We should round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 49. Let me recompute the means with rounding at the end.\n\n      We'll compute each mean and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 50. Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimals as in the input.\n\n 51. We'll compute the means and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 52. But note: the original data had up to 3 decimals, so we can round the means to 3 decimals.\n\n 53. Let me recalculate a few to see:\n\n      Hour0: (1.072 -0.067 -0.268 -1.005) = (1.072 -0.067)=1.005; (1.005-0.268)=0.737; (0.737-1.005)=-0.268 -> -0.268/4 = -0.067 -> -0.067\n\n      Hour1: (1.340 -0.469 -0.603 -1.206) = 1.340 -0.469 = 0.871; 0.871-0.603=0.268; 0.268-1.206=-0.938 -> -0.938/4 = -0.2345 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.234 (if we round half up, -0.2345 -> -0.234? But note: 5 is exactly in the middle, so we round to even? or up? Typically in such contexts, we round to 3 decimals by rounding half up.\n\n      According to standard rounding: \n          -0.2345: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 4 becomes 5? But negative? \n          Actually, we round the absolute value: 0.2345 -> 0.235, then negative: -0.235.\n\n      However, the original data has values with 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals by rounding half away from zero.\n\n      But to be consistent, we can use: round(x, 3)\n\n      In Python, rounding -0.2345 to 3 decimals: \n          round(-0.2345, 3) -> -0.234? or -0.235? \n\n      According to IEEE: round half to even. But let me check:\n\n          The number is -0.2345. The two possibilities are -0.234 and -0.235. The even one? \n          Actually, 0.2345 is exactly halfway between 0.234 and 0.235. The even digit in the thousandths place: 4 is even? and 5 is odd? \n          The rule: round to the nearest even digit in the final place.\n\n          The digits: 0.2345 -> the thousandths place is 4 (even) and the next is 5 -> so we round to 0.234? \n          But then negative: -0.234.\n\n      However, in many systems, they round half away from zero: so -0.2345 -> -0.235.\n\n      We'll follow the standard of the data: the data has values like 1.072, 1.340, etc. with 3 decimals.\n\n      We'll round to 3 decimals by using: round(x, 3) in the typical way (round half to even).\n\n      But note: the problem does not to omit any content, so we output the numbers as computed and then rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 54. We'll output the numbers rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 55. We'll recalc the means and round each to 3 decimals.\n\n 56. Alternatively, we can output the numbers as we computed and then format to 3 decimals.\n\n 57. We'll do:\n\n        hour0: -0.067 -> already 3 decimals: -0.067\n        hour1: -0.2345 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> round the 3rd decimal (4) to the next? \n            Since 4 is even, we leave it? Actually, the rule: \n                We look at the digit after the one we are rounding: 5 -> then we round to the nearest even digit for the 3rd decimal.\n\n            The 3rd decimal is 4 (even) -> we leave it? but 0.2345 is exactly halfway? \n            Actually, the rule: \n                If the digit to be removed is 5 and there are no digits after it, then we round to the nearest even digit.\n\n            So 0.2345: \n                We are rounding to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> then we look at the 3rd decimal: 4 (even) -> we leave it -> 0.234 -> then negative: -0.234.\n\n            But wait, 0.2345 is actually 0.2345, which is 2345/10000. The exact halfway would be 0.23450? \n            Since we have 0.2345, it is 2345/10000 = 469/2000 = 0.2345, which is exactly between 0.234 and 0.235? \n            So we round to even: 0.234 (because 4 is even).\n\n            So -0.2345 -> -0.234\n\n        However, let me check with Python: \n            round(-0.2345, 3) -> -0.234   (in Python 3, it uses round half to even)\n\n        So we do that.\n\n 58. We'll compute each mean and then round to 3 decimals using round_half_to_even.\n\n 59. But for simplicity, we can use the numbers we computed and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 60. We'll recalc the 24 hours with rounding:\n\n      We'll do:\n\n        hour0: -0.067 -> -0.067\n        hour1: -0.2345 -> -0.234\n        hour2: -0.21775 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 7 -> so we round up the 3rd decimal: 7 -> becomes 8? \n            Actually, the 3rd decimal is 7, and the 4th is 7 (>=5) -> round up: 7+1=8 -> -0.218\n        hour3: -0.4355 -> \n            4th decimal is 5 -> then 3rd decimal is 5 (odd) -> so we round up to 6? \n            But wait: the rule: round to even. The current 3 is 5 (odd) -> we round up to 6? \n            Actually, the number is -0.4355: \n                The 3rd decimal is 5, and the next is 5 -> we round to the nearest even: 5 is odd -> so we round up to 6 -> -0.436\n        hour4: -0.536 -> already 3 decimals -> -0.536\n        hour5: -0.41875 -> \n            4th decimal is 7 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 8 becomes 9 -> -0.419\n        hour6: -0.82075 -> \n            4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 0 becomes 1? and 7 in the 3rd decimal? \n            Actually: -0.82075: \n                3rd decimal is 0, 4th is 7 -> round up the 0 to 1? -> -0.821\n        hour7: -0.5025 -> \n            4th decimal is 5 -> 3rd decimal is 2 (even) -> so we leave it? -> -0.502\n        hour8: -0.201 -> already 3 decimals -> -0.201\n        hour9: -0.4355 -> same as hour3: -0.436\n        hour10: -0.268 -> already 3 decimals -> -0.268\n        hour11: 0.0335 -> \n            4th decimal 5 -> 3rd decimal is 3 (odd) -> round up to 4 -> 0.034\n        hour12: 0.63625 -> \n            4th decimal 2 -> so we leave the 3rd decimal (6) -> 0.636\n        hour13: 0.25125 -> \n            4th decimal 2 -> leave -> 0.251\n        hour14: 0.4855 -> \n            4th decimal 5 -> 3rd decimal 5 (odd) -> round up to 6 -> 0.486\n        hour15: 0.05025 -> \n            4th decimal 2 -> leave -> 0.050\n        hour16: -0.988 -> -0.988\n        hour17: -1.54075 -> \n            4th decimal 7 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 0 becomes 1 -> -1.541\n        hour18: -2.49525 -> \n            4th decimal 2 -> leave -> -2.495\n        hour19: -2.4115 -> \n            4th decimal 5 -> 3rd decimal 1 (odd) -> round up to 2 -> -2.412\n        hour20: -2.26075 -> \n            4th decimal 7 -> round up: 0 becomes 1 -> -2.261\n        hour21: -2.0765 -> \n            4th decimal 5 -> 3rd decimal 6 (even) -> leave -> -2.076\n        hour22: -1.2895 -> \n            4th decimal 5 -> 3rd decimal 9 (odd) -> round up: 9 becomes 10 -> so we carry: 8 becomes 9 and 9 becomes 0, then 2 becomes 3? \n            Actually: -1.2895: \n                The 3rd decimal is 9, adding 1 makes it 10 -> so we set 0 and carry 1 to the hundredths: 8 becomes 9 -> so -1.290\n        hour23: -0.067 -> -0.067\n\n 61. So the rounded means:\n\n        hour0: -0.067\n        hour1: -0.234\n        hour2: -0.218\n        hour3: -0.436\n        hour4: -0.536\n        hour5: -0.419\n        hour6: -0.821\n        hour7: -0.502\n        hour8: -0.201\n        hour9: -0.436\n        hour10: -0.268\n        hour11: 0.034\n        hour12: 0.636\n        hour13: 0.251\n        hour14: 0.486\n        hour15: 0.050\n        hour16: -0.988\n        hour17: -1.541\n        hour18: -2.495\n        hour19: -2.412\n        hour20: -2.261\n        hour21: -2.076\n        hour22: -1.290\n        hour23: -0.067\n\n 62. Now we write the forecast for the next 4 days using these 24 values repeated.\n\n 63. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-30 00:00:00, then 2017-09-30 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-03 23:00:00.\n\n 64. We output:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2017-09-30 00:00:00 -0.067\n        2017-09-30 01:00:00 -0.234\n        2017-09-30 02:00:00 -0.218\n        2017-09-30 03:00:00 -0.436\n        2017-09-30 04:00:00 -0.536\n        2017-09-30 05:00:00 -0.419\n        2017-09-30 06:00:00 -0.821\n        2017-09-30 07:00:00 -0.502\n        2017-09-30 08:00:00 -0.201\n        2017-09-30 09:00:00 -0.436\n        2017-09-30 10:00:00 -0.268\n        2017-09-30 11:00:00 0.034\n        2017-09-30 12:00:00 0.636\n        2017-09-30 13:00:00 0.251\n        2017-09-30 14:00:00 0.486\n        2017-09-30 15:00:00 0.050\n        2017-09-30 16:00:00 -0.988\n        2017-09-30 17:00:00 -1.541\n        2017-09-30 18:00:00 -2.495\n        2017-09-30 19:00:00 -2.412\n        2017-09-30 20:00:00 -2.261\n        2017-09-30 21:00:00 -2.076\n        2017-09-30 22:00:00 -1.290\n        2017-09-30 23:00:00 -0.067\n\n        Then the same for 2017-10-01, 2017-10-02, 2017-10-03.\n\n 65. We write 96 lines.\n\n 66. We output in the required format.\n\n 67. Note: the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 68. We'll generate the dates:\n\n      from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n      start_date = datetime(2017,9,30,0,0,0)\n      for i in range(0,96):\n          current = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n          formatted_date = current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n          value = the value from the hour of the day (i mod 24) from the list of 24 means.\n\n 69. But we have the list of 24 means (rounded) for hour0 to hour23.\n\n 70. We'll do:\n\n        hours = [\n            -0.067, -0.234, -0.218, -0.436, -0.536, -0.419, \n            -0.821, -0.502, -0.201, -0.436, -0.268, 0.034, \n            0.636, 0.251, 0.486, 0.050, -0.988, -1.541, \n            -2.495, -2.412, -2.261, -2.076, -1.290, -0.067\n        ]\n\n      Then for i in 0..95:\n          hour_index = i % 24\n          value = hours[hour_index]\n\n 71.

We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 73. We note: the last day (2017-10-03) the last hour (23:00:00) is the 95th index: 95 % 24 = 23 -> hours[23] = -0.067.\n\n 74. We output the data.\n\n 75.
