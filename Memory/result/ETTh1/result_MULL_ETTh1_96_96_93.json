        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not show any (no NaN in the given 96 points). \n    However, we are to be aware that there might be missing values in the data we are to forecast? But the instruction says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must provide 96 values without any missing.\n\n 2. We are to use time series forecasting. Given the hourly data, we can consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even more advanced models. However, without more context and given the short history (only 96 points), we need a robust method.\n\n 3. Since the data shows a pattern (with negative values dominating and some positive spikes) and possibly daily seasonality (24 hours in a day), we can try to model with a seasonal component.\n\n 4. We are to provide the next 96 points. We note that the data is hourly and we are to generate 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 5. Given the constraints of the problem and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer without any missing values, we must generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n 6. We can use a simple approach: \n    - Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    - Use a model that can handle seasonality, such as SARIMA.\n\n 7. However, note that we are not allowed to output any code or explanation, only the data in the required format.\n\n 8. Since we are in a simulated environment and cannot run actual code, we must rely on a pre-defined method. We'll describe the steps we would take and then generate the forecast using a reasonable method.\n\n 9. Steps we would take (if we were to code):\n    a. Preprocess: The given data has no missing values in the provided 96 points, so we can use it as is.\n    b. Check for seasonality: The data seems to have a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can set seasonality to 24.\n    c. We'll use a SARIMA model. We can't do an extensive grid search for parameters, so we choose a reasonable set: \n        order=(1,1,1) and seasonal_order=(1,1,1,24) might be a starting point.\n    d. Fit the model and forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 10. But note: the data might have non-constant variance or non-stationarity. We might need to take a difference. However, we are limited by the fact that we are not actually running code.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: \n     - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual, then forecast each component? \n     - Or use a moving average method with seasonality.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide an answer, we will simulate a forecast. However, without actual computation, we must generate the numbers.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must forecast. We are expected to provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n 14. We observe the data: \n     - The values range from about -3 to 2.5.\n     - There are negative values and positive, with some spikes.\n\n 15. We can use a naive method: \n     - Use the last 24 hours (one day) as a pattern and repeat it for the next 4 days? But the data does not look exactly repeating.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use an average of the last few days and adjust for the day of the week? But we only have 4 days of data.\n\n 17. Since we have to provide 96 numbers, we decide to use a simulated forecast. We will generate the forecast using a random walk with drift and seasonality? \n\n 18. However, we must be realistic. We note that the data provided ends at 2017-07-11 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n 19. We can use an average of the same hour from the previous 4 days? But we only have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days: 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th of July.\n\n     For example, for 2017-07-12 00:00:00, we take the average of:\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00: 0.000\n        2017-07-09 00:00:00: 0.604\n        2017-07-10 00:00:00: -0.675\n        2017-07-11 00:00:00: -0.782\n\n        Average = (0.000 + 0.604 - 0.675 - 0.782) / 4 = (0.604 - 0.675 = -0.071; -0.071 -0.782 = -0.853; then /4 = -0.21325)\n\n     Then we do the same for each hour of the day.\n\n 20. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to see a weekly trend. Also, the data for the same hour might be changing over the 4 days.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? Or we can use exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n 22. Given the simplicity, we'll use the average method for the same hour. We'll compute the average_hour0 = (value_day1_h0 + value_day2_h0 + value_day3_h0 + value_day4_h0) / 4\n and then use that for the next day at hour0, and similarly for other hours.\n\n 23. But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So we can use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days? That is, the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times? \n\n 24. However, the pattern might change. We can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form a daily profile, and then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n 25. Steps for the forecast:\n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average over the 4 available days.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days, assign the average for that hour.\n\n 26. Example for hour 0: \n        Day1: 0.000, Day2: 0.604, Day3: -0.675, Day4: -0.782 -> average = (0.000+0.604-0.675-0.782)/4 = (-0.853)/4 = -0.21325\n\n     Similarly, for hour 1: \n        Day1: 0.711, Day2: 0.604, Day3: 0.036, Day4: -0.817 -> average = (0.711+0.604+0.036-0.817)/4 = (0.534)/4 = 0.1335\n\n     And so on.\n\n 27. Then the forecast for:\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00: -0.21325\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00: 0.1335\n        ... until 2017-07-12 23:00:00 (using the average for hour 23)\n        Then 2017-07-13 00:00:00: again -0.21325 (same as the average for hour0)\n        and so on.\n\n 28. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality. However, it ignores any trend and any other patterns. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 29. We must compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days (index 0 to 3) and 24 hours (0 to 23). We'll group by hour.\n\n     Hour 0: [0.000, 0.604, -0.675, -0.782] -> (-0.853)/4 = -0.21325\n     Hour 1: [0.711, 0.604, 0.036, -0.817] -> (0.711+0.604+0.036-0.817) = 0.534 -> 0.1335\n     Hour 2: [0.782, 0.284, -0.142, -0.959] -> (0.782+0.284-0.142-0.959) = -0.035 -> -0.00875\n     Hour 3: [0.071, -0.711, -0.817, -1.279] -> (0.071-0.711-0.817-1.279) = -2.736 -> -0.684\n     Hour 4: [0.959, -0.497, -1.137, -0.853] -> (0.959-0.497-1.137-0.853) = -1.528 -> -0.382\n     Hour 5: [-0.142, -0.107, -1.457, -1.528] -> (-0.142-0.107-1.457-1.528) = -3.234 -> -0.8085\n     Hour 6: [-0.284, -1.137, -2.274, -1.421] -> (-0.284-1.137-2.274-1.421) = -5.116 -> -1.279\n     Hour 7: [0.426, -1.173, -1.919, -0.569] -> (0.426-1.173-1.919-0.569) = -3.235 -> -0.80875\n     Hour 8: [-0.533, -1.208, -1.279, 0.107] -> (-0.533-1.208-1.279+0.107) = -2.913 -> -0.72825\n     Hour 9: [0.071, -1.528, -0.497, 0.462] -> (0.071-1.528-0.497+0.462) = -1.492 -> -0.373\n     Hour 10: [-0.604, -0.888, -1.173, 2.416] -> (-0.604-0.888-1.173+2.416) = -0.249 -> -0.06225\n     Hour 11: [-0.604, -1.208, -1.031, 2.239] -> (-0.604-1.208-1.031+2.239) = -0.604 -> -0.151\n     Hour 12: [0.320, -0.675, -0.995, 1.706] -> (0.320-0.675-0.995+1.706) = 0.356 -> 0.089\n     Hour 13: [-0.675, -1.635, 0.711, 0.000] -> (-0.675-1.635+0.711+0.000) = -1.599 -> -0.39975\n     Hour 14: [-0.533, -1.386, -0.995, 1.315] -> (-0.533-1.386-0.995+1.315) = -1.599 -> -0.39975\n     Hour 15: [-1.315, -0.924, -0.249, 0.959] -> (-1.315-0.924-0.249+0.959) = -1.529 -> -0.38225\n     Hour 16: [-0.995, -1.848, -1.635, 0.284] -> (-0.995-1.848-1.635+0.284) = -4.194 -> -1.0485\n     Hour 17: [-1.386, -1.599, -1.350, -0.853] -> (-1.386-1.599-1.350-0.853) = -5.188 -> -1.297\n     Hour 18: [-1.635, -1.848, -1.919, -1.528] -> (-1.635-1.848-1.919-1.528) = -6.93 -> -1.7325\n     Hour 19: [-1.279, -2.345, -1.706, -1.635] -> (-1.279-2.345-1.706-1.635) = -6.965 -> -1.74125\n     Hour 20: [-1.102, -1.954, -1.777, -1.457] -> (-1.102-1.954-1.777-1.457) = -6.29 -> -1.5725\n     Hour 21: [-1.706, -2.985, -1.599, -1.528] -> (-1.706-2.985-1.599-1.528) = -7.818 -> -1.9545\n     Hour 22: [-0.782, -0.711, -1.635, -2.025] -> (-0.782-0.711-1.635-2.025) = -5.153 -> -1.28825\n     Hour 23: [-0.249, -1.635, -0.036, -1.635] -> (-0.249-1.635-0.036-1.635) = -3.555 -> -0.88875\n\n 31. Now, we have 24 average values for the 24 hours. We will use these to form the next 4 days.\n\n 32. The next 96 hours (starting from 2017-07-12 00:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-07-12): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day 2 (2017-07-13): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (2017-07-14): same\n        Day 4 (2017-07-15): same\n\n 33. We must generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 34. Format the answer: We must output in the same format as the input, with the timestamp and the MULL value.\n\n 35. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 36. Let's create the forecast:\n\n     Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00 -> -0.213 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n           2017-07-12 01:00:00 -> 0.134\n           ... and so on.\n\n 37. We'll write the next 96 lines.\n\n 38. Note: the original data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 39. The computed averages (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n     Hour0: -0.213\n     Hour1: 0.134\n     Hour2: -0.009\n     Hour3: -0.684\n     Hour4: -0.382\n     Hour5: -0.809\n     Hour6: -1.279\n     Hour7: -0.809\n     Hour8: -0.728\n     Hour9: -0.373\n     Hour10: -0.062\n     Hour11: -0.151\n     Hour12: 0.089\n     Hour13: -0.400\n     Hour14: -0.400\n     Hour15: -0.382\n     Hour16: -1.049\n     Hour17: -1.297\n     Hour18: -1.733\n     Hour19: -1.741\n     Hour20: -1.573\n     Hour21: -1.955\n     Hour22: -1.288\n     Hour23: -0.889\n\n 40. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day1: 2017-07-12: from hour0 to hour23: use the above 24 values in order.\n      Day2: 2017-07-13: same 24 values.\n      Day3: 2017-07-14: same.\n      Day4: 2017-07-15: same.\n\n 41. We must output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-12 00:00:00  [value]\n2017-07-12 01:00:00  [value]\n...\n2017-07-15 23:00:00  [value]\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 42. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 43. Note: The dates must be consecutive and in the correct format.\n\n 44. Let's generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-07-12 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-12 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Then 2017-07-13 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      Then 2017-07-14 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      Then 2017-07-15 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 45. We have 96 values.\n\n 46. We output the data.\n\n 47. However, note: the user might have expected a more sophisticated model? But given the constraints, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 48. We'll output the data as computed.\n\n 49. Let's write the data (with the rounded values for each hour as above).\n\n 50. We note: the rounding was done to 3 decimal places.\n\n 51. The forecasted values:\n\n      Hour0: -0.213\n      Hour1: 0.134\n      Hour2: -0.009\n      Hour3: -0.684\n      Hour4: -0.382\n      Hour5: -0.809\n      Hour6: -1.279\n      Hour7: -0.809\n      Hour8: -0.728\n      Hour9: -0.373\n      Hour10: -0.062\n      Hour11: -0.151\n      Hour12: 0.089\n      Hour13: -0.400\n      Hour14: -0.400\n      Hour15: -0.382\n      Hour16: -1.049\n      Hour17: -1.297\n      Hour18: -1.733\n      Hour19: -1.741\n      Hour20: -1.573\n      Hour21: -1.955\n      Hour22: -1.288\n      Hour23: -0.889\n\n 52. Now, we write the next 96 lines.\n\n 53. Example for the first day:\n\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00 -0.213\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00 0.134\n        2017-07-12 02:00:00 -0.009\n        2017-07-12 03:00:00 -0.684\n        2017-07-12 04:00:00 -0.382\n        2017-07-12 05:00:00 -0.809\n        2017-07-12 06:00:00 -1.279\n        2017-07-12 07:00:00 -0.809\n        2017-07-12 08:00:00 -0.728\n        2017-07-12 09:00:00 -0.373\n        2017-07-12 10:00:00 -0.062\n        2017-07-12 11:00:00 -0.151\n        2017-07-12 12:00:00 0.089\n        2017-07-12 13:00:00 -0.400\n        2017-07-12 14:00:00 -0.400\n        2017-07-12 15:00:00 -0.382\n        2017-07-12 16:00:00 -1.049\n        2017-07-12 17:00:00 -1.297\n        2017-07-12 18:00:00 -1.733\n        2017-07-12 19:00:00 -1.741\n        2017-07-12 20:00:00 -1.573\n        2017-07-12 21:00:00 -1.955\n        2017-07-12 22:00:00 -1.288\n        2017-07-12 23:00:00 -0.889\n\n     Then the next day (2017-07-13) starts again with hour0: -0.213, and so on.\n\n 54.
