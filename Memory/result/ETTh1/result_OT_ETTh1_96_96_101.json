        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missingness in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, in the provided 96 points, we have consecutive hourly data without gaps. So we assume the provided history is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We note that the data shows:\n    - Daily seasonality: the temperature pattern repeats every 24 hours (though with variation).\n    - There might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days of data, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the limited history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend: from the data, the trend is not very clear. The temperature fluctuates daily.\n    - Seasonality: 24-hour cycle.\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal model. Since we are in a constrained environment without the ability to run code, we must rely on a simple method.\n\n 6. One simple method is to use the last available day (2017-08-12) as a template and adjust it by the average change from the previous days?\n    However, note that the data does not look exactly the same every day.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days for the same hour. But we only have 4 days.\n\n    Let's break the data into days:\n        Day 1: 2017-08-09 (index 0-23)\n        Day 2: 2017-08-10 (index 24-47)\n        Day 3: 2017-08-11 (index 48-71)\n        Day 4: 2017-08-12 (index 72-95)\n\n 8. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n    But note: the last day (2017-08-12) has some unusual low values (e.g., at 10:00 and 11:00). So averaging might smooth that.\n\n 9. However, we are to forecast 4 days. We can also consider a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we choose to use the average of the same hour for the next 4 days. That is:\n\n     For hour h (where h from 0 to 23) in the next 4 (days 5,6,7,8 relative to the first day? but we only have 4 days history),\n     we compute:\n        forecast_h = (OT_h_day1 + OT_h_day2 + OT_h_day3 + OT_h_day4) / 4\n\n     Then we use this average for each hour for the next 4 days.\n\n 11. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the average temperature per day:\n\n     Day1: 2017-08-09: \n        min: 11.537, max: 17.094 -> average around 15.5? (by quick look)\n     Day2: 2017-08-10: \n        min: 15.547, max: 21.174 -> average around 18?\n     Day3: 2017-08-11: \n        min: 16.461, max: 20.26 -> average around 18?\n     Day4: 2017-08-12: \n        min: 9.989, max: 17.587 -> average around 13.5?\n\n     There is a drop on day4. So if we take the average, we are smoothing the daily pattern but the level of the series might be the average of the 4 days.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last day (2017-08-12) as the forecast for the next day, then the day before that for the next, etc.?\n     But that would be repeating the last 4 days? That might not be accurate.\n\n 13. Considering the simplicity and the requirement, we will use the average by hour.\n\n 14. Steps for the average by hour:\n\n     We have 24 hours. For each hour (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from the 4 days). We average them.\n\n     Example for hour 0: \n        2017-08-09 00:00:00 -> 15.265\n        2017-08-10 00:00:00 -> 15.969\n        2017-08-11 00:00:00 -> 17.657\n        2017-08-12 00:00:00 -> 17.516\n        average = (15.265 + 15.969 + 17.657 + 17.516) / 4 = 66.407 / 4 = 16.60175\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, each day at 00:00:00 we will use 16.60175.\n\n 15. But note: the data has 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 16. However, this method ignores any trend. The last day (2017-08-12) was a drop. But without more data, we cannot know if that drop is a new pattern or an anomaly.\n\n 17. Since the problem states that the data has missing values, but in the provided history we don't have missing, we assume the forecast is based on the given 96 points.\n\n 18. We generate the next 96 points (4 days) by repeating the same 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n 19. We must generate the dates: \n        Start: 2017-08-13 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-08-12 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-08-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n 20. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) by collecting the values from the 4 days.\n\n     Then, for the next 4 days, we have 4*24=96 hours, we assign:\n        hour0: average of the 0th hour of the day\n        hour1: average of the 1st hour of the day\n        ...\n        hour23: average of the 23rd hour of the day\n\n     and then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 21. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     We'll index the provided data by hour of day:\n\n        hour0: [15.265, 15.969, 17.657, 17.516] -> average = (15.265+15.969+17.657+17.516)/4 = 16.60175 -> 16.602\n        hour1: [15.336, 15.617, 17.305, 17.446] -> (15.336+15.617+17.305+17.446)/4 = 65.704/4 = 16.426\n        hour2: [15.054, 15.547, 17.094, 17.587] -> (15.054+15.547+17.094+17.587)/4 = 65.282/4 = 16.3205 -> 16.321\n        hour3: [15.054, 15.687, 16.883, 16.250] -> (15.054+15.687+16.883+16.250)/4 = 63.874/4 = 15.9685 -> 15.969\n        hour4: [14.984, 15.547, 17.024, 17.024] -> (14.984+15.547+17.024+17.024)/4 = 64.579/4 = 16.14475 -> 16.145\n        hour5: [12.311, 15.547, 16.461, 16.813] -> (12.311+15.547+16.461+16.813)/4 = 61.132/4 = 15.283\n        hour6: [11.678, 15.547, 16.532, 15.476] -> (11.678+15.547+16.532+15.476)/4 = 59.233/4 = 14.80825 -> 14.808\n        hour7: [11.537, 15.617, 17.165, 13.296] -> (11.537+15.617+17.165+13.296)/4 = 57.615/4 = 14.40375 -> 14.404\n        hour8: [14.703, 16.602, 18.009, 14.703] -> (14.703+16.602+18.009+14.703)/4 = 64.017/4 = 16.00425 -> 16.004\n        hour9: [15.547, 16.461, 18.501, 13.225] -> (15.547+16.461+18.501+13.225)/4 = 63.734/4 = 15.9335 -> 15.934\n        hour10: [15.898, 16.743, 19.205, 10.200] -> (15.898+16.743+19.205+10.200)/4 = 62.046/4 = 15.5115 -> 15.512\n        hour11: [15.828, 17.657, 18.642, 9.989] -> (15.828+17.657+18.642+9.989)/4 = 62.116/4 = 15.529\n        hour12: [15.828, 18.009, 19.486, 13.014] -> (15.828+18.009+19.486+13.014)/4 = 66.337/4 = 16.58425 -> 16.584\n        hour13: [16.109, 18.220, 20.119, 10.974] -> (16.109+18.220+20.119+10.974)/4 = 65.422/4 = 16.3555 -> 16.356\n        hour14: [16.672, 19.768, 20.260, 14.069] -> (16.672+19.768+20.260+14.069)/4 = 70.769/4 = 17.69225 -> 17.692\n        hour15: [16.813, 20.471, 19.556, 12.592] -> (16.813+20.471+19.556+12.592)/4 = 69.432/4 = 17.358\n        hour16: [16.532, 21.174, 19.345, 10.833] -> (16.532+21.174+19.345+10.833)/4 = 67.884/4 = 16.971\n        hour17: [17.094, 21.174, 19.345, 11.326] -> (17.094+21.174+19.345+11.326)/4 = 68.939/4 = 17.23475 -> 17.235\n        hour18: [16.743, 19.416, 18.501, 12.029] -> (16.743+19.416+18.501+12.029)/4 = 66.689/4 = 16.67225 -> 16.672\n        hour19: [15.617, 18.431, 17.938, 14.773] -> (15.617+18.431+17.938+14.773)/4 = 66.759/4 = 16.68975 -> 16.690\n        hour20: [15.758, 18.009, 17.587, 14.984] -> (15.758+18.009+17.587+14.984)/4 = 66.338/4 = 16.5845 -> 16.585\n        hour21: [15.828, 17.446, 17.657, 14.914] -> (15.828+17.446+17.657+14.914)/4 = 65.845/4 = 16.46125 -> 16.461\n        hour22: [15.687, 17.938, 17.657, 14.984] -> (15.687+17.938+17.657+14.984)/4 = 66.266/4 = 16.5665 -> 16.567\n        hour23: [15.336, 17.587, 17.024, 14.843] -> (15.336+17.587+17.024+14.843)/4 = 64.79/4 = 16.1975 -> 16.198\n\n 22. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-13\n          00:00:00 -> 16.602\n          01:00:00 -> 16.426\n          02:00:00 -> 16.321\n          ... until 23:00:00 -> 16.198\n\n        Day2: 2017-08-14: same pattern\n        Day3: 2017-08-15: same pattern\n        Day4: 2017-08-16: same pattern\n\n 23. We output the data in the same format: two columns \"date\" and \"OT\", with the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 24. We note: the original data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 25. However, note that the original data had some precision beyond 3 decimals? But we are given 3. We'll output 3.\n\n 26. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-13 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-13 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-14 00:00:00 ... until 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 28. The forecasted values for each hour of the day (0 to 23) are:\n\n        hour0: 16.602\n        hour1: 16.426\n        hour2: 16.321\n        hour3: 15.969\n        hour4: 16.145\n        hour5: 15.283\n        hour6: 14.808\n        hour7: 14.404\n        hour8: 16.004\n        hour9: 15.934\n        hour10: 15.512\n        hour11: 15.529\n        hour12: 16.584\n        hour13: 16.356\n        hour14: 17.692\n        hour15: 17.358\n        hour16: 16.971\n        hour17: 17.235\n        hour18: 16.672\n        hour19: 16.690\n        hour20: 16.585\n        hour21: 16.461\n        hour22: 16.567\n        hour23: 16.198\n\n 29. Then we repeat this list 4 times (for the 4 days).\n\n 30. Write the output in the required format.\n\n 31.
