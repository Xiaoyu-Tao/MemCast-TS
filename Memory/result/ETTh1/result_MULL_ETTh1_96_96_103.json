        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 recorded dates (i.e., the next 96 hours, from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided 96 points do not have any missing values? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. So for the given data, we don't have missing values. But the problem might imply that in the future there could be missing values? \n    But the instruction: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\" meaning we have to provide 96 points without any missing.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows daily patterns (as seen by the fluctuation every 24 hours), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has some irregularities (e.g., on 2017-08-20 the values are much higher). We must account for the possibility of such events.\n\n 5. Since we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we must generate the timestamps and the forecasted MULL values.\n\n 6. We'll use the following approach:\n    - Preprocess: Check for missing values in the given data? The provided data is complete. But if there were, we would impute (e.g., linear interpolation or forward fill). \n    - We'll use a model: Let's choose SARIMA because of the clear daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24 hours).\n\n 7. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We have to choose parameters: (p,d,q) for non-seasonal part and (P,D,Q,s) for seasonal part. s=24 (since 24 hours in a day).\n    - We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters? But we are in a simulated environment without the ability to run code. So we have to rely on typical patterns.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method if we are to write the forecast without running code? But the problem expects a forecast.\n\n 9. Since I cannot run code here, I will describe the process and then provide a simulated forecast. However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, I will generate a forecast by:\n     - Extending the time series with a naive seasonal method: using the last available day (2017-08-20) as a template and adjust by the trend observed in the last few days? \n       But note: the last day (2017-08-20) has unusually high values. Alternatively, we can take the average of the last two days? \n\n 11. However, the problem says I am an expert and must provide the forecast. Since I cannot compute it without a model, I will simulate a forecast by:\n\n     Option 1: Using the average of the same hour from the previous days (with a window of 3 days) to forecast the next 96 hours.\n\n     Steps for Option 1:\n        - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 days we have? But we have 4 days: 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th.\n        - However, the 20th is an outlier? So we might use the median? Or we can use the 20th as the most recent and weight it more? \n\n     Alternatively, we can use a weighted average: more weight to the most recent day.\n\n     But note: the data shows a pattern that on the 20th the values were much higher. It might be a weekend? Or a special day? We don't have context.\n\n     Since we are to forecast the next 4 days (21st to 24th) and the 20th was a Sunday? (We can check: 2017-08-17 is Thursday, 18 Friday, 19 Saturday, 20 Sunday). \n     Then the next days: 21st Monday, 22nd Tuesday, 23rd Wednesday, 24th Thursday.\n\n     We might expect that the pattern of the 17th (Thursday) and the 24th (next Thursday) to be similar? But we don't have enough data for weekly seasonality.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we only have 4 days, we will use a simple method:\n\n     - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour for the last 4 days? But the 20th is an anomaly? \n\n     Alternatively, we can use the last two days (19th and 20th) and the same day of the previous week? But we don't have previous week).\n\n 13. Since we don't have a full week, we can only rely on the 4 days. We note:\n\n      Day 1 (17th): Thursday\n      Day 2 (18th): Friday\n      Day 3 (19th): Saturday\n      Day 4 (20th): Sunday\n\n      Then the next 4 days: \n        21st: Monday -> we don't have Monday data? \n        22nd: Tuesday\n        23rd: Wednesday\n        24th: Thursday -> we have the 17th (Thursday) as a reference.\n\n      So for the 24th (Thursday) we can use the 17th as a template? But the 17th was the first day and the 20th was an outlier Sunday.\n\n 14. Given the ambiguity, I will use a simple approach: use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n     For hour h (0 to 23) on day 5 (2017-08-21, Monday) we set:\n        forecast_h = (h_value_day1 + h_value_day2 + h_value_day3 + h_value_day4) / 4\n\n     Then for the next days: \n        day6 (21st): use the average of day1 to day4 for each hour\n        day7 (22nd): same as day6? \n        day8 (23rd): same\n        day9 (24th): same\n\n     But that would be the same pattern for all 4 days? \n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the last 4 days to compute the average daily pattern and then apply that pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n     However, we note that the 20th was much higher. So we might use the median per hour? \n\n 16. Let's do:\n\n     For each hour (0 to 23), we have 4 values: from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n     We can use the median to avoid the outlier? But the 20th is the most recent and might be more indicative? \n\n 17. Considering the requirement and the complexity, I will use the median for each hour over the 4 days to form a typical day, and then repeat that typical day for the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps:\n        - For hour 0: [0.675 (17th), 1.315 (18th), 0.711 (19th), 0.782 (20th)] -> sort: [0.675, 0.711, 0.782, 1.315] -> median = (0.711+0.782)/2 = 0.7465\n        - Similarly for each hour.\n\n     But note: the 20th has very high values in the afternoon hours. The median might not capture that? \n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the average but without the 20th? But then we lose the most recent pattern.\n\n 19. Given the problem and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, I will use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form the daily pattern and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n     Example for hour0: (0.675 + 1.315 + 0.711 + 0.782) / 4 = (0.675+1.315=1.99; 0.711+0.782=1.493; total=3.483) -> 3.483/4 = 0.87075\n\n     We'll do this for each hour and then replicate for 4 days.\n\n 20. However, we must account for the fact that the 20th was a Sunday and the next days are weekdays? The pattern might be different. But without historical data for Monday, we cannot adjust.\n\n 21. We'll proceed with the average of the 4 days.\n\n 22. Compute the average for each hour:\n\n     hour0: (0.675, 1.315, 0.711, 0.782) -> 0.87075\n     hour1: (0.782, 1.670, 1.066, -0.107) -> (0.782+1.670+1.066-0.107)/4 = 3.411/4 = 0.85275\n     hour2: (0.426, 0.391, 0.995, 0.249) -> (0.426+0.391+0.995+0.249)/4 = 2.061/4 = 0.51525\n     hour3: (1.173, 1.102, 0.995, 0.284) -> (1.173+1.102+0.995+0.284)/4 = 3.554/4 = 0.8885\n     hour4: (0.888, 1.457, 0.604, 1.031) -> (0.888+1.457+0.604+1.031)/4 = 3.98/4 = 0.995\n     hour5: (0.391, 0.320, 0.355, 0.746) -> (0.391+0.320+0.355+0.746)/4 = 1.812/4 = 0.453\n     hour6: (0.782, 0.284, -0.426, 0.675) -> (0.782+0.284-0.426+0.675)/4 = 1.315/4 = 0.32875\n     hour7: (0.924, 0.284, 0.782, 1.315) -> (0.924+0.284+0.782+1.315)/4 = 3.305/4 = 0.82625\n     hour8: (0.675, 0.746, -0.142, 1.386) -> (0.675+0.746-0.142+1.386)/4 = 2.665/4 = 0.66625\n     hour9: (1.421, 1.315, 0.071, 2.061) -> (1.421+1.315+0.071+2.061)/4 = 4.868/4 = 1.217\n     hour10: (3.056, 2.203, 1.741, 2.594) -> (3.056+2.203+1.741+2.594)/4 = 9.594/4 = 2.3985\n     hour11: (1.635, 3.020, 2.452, 2.274) -> (1.635+3.020+2.452+2.274)/4 = 9.381/4 = 2.34525\n     hour12: (1.990, 2.061, 0.533, 3.163) -> (1.990+2.061+0.533+3.163)/4 = 7.747/4 = 1.93675\n     hour13: (2.701, 1.635, -0.178, 2.985) -> (2.701+1.635-0.178+2.985)/4 = 7.143/4 = 1.78575\n     hour14: (2.559, 1.599, 3.020, 6.148) -> (2.559+1.599+3.020+6.148)/4 = 13.326/4 = 3.3315\n     hour15: (1.279, 0.604, 0.497, 3.767) -> (1.279+0.604+0.497+3.767)/4 = 6.147/4 = 1.53675\n     hour16: (0.355, -1.564, -0.782, 3.447) -> (0.355 -1.564 -0.782 +3.447)/4 = 1.456/4 = 0.364\n     hour17: (-0.355, -1.279, -1.635, 3.518) -> (-0.355-1.279-1.635+3.518)/4 = 0.249/4 = 0.06225\n     hour18: (-1.492, -1.954, -2.061, 2.985) -> (-1.492-1.954-2.061+2.985)/4 = (-2.522)/4 = -0.6305\n     hour19: (-2.132, -1.812, -1.848, 2.843) -> (-2.132-1.812-1.848+2.843)/4 = (-2.949)/4 = -0.73725\n     hour20: (-1.244, -1.457, 0.426, 2.949) -> (-1.244-1.457+0.426+2.949)/4 = 0.674/4 = 0.1685\n     hour21: (-0.462, -0.924, 0.711, 2.025) -> (-0.462-0.924+0.711+2.025)/4 = 1.35/4 = 0.3375\n     hour22: (-0.497, -0.569, 1.706, 4.655) -> (-0.497-0.569+1.706+4.655)/4 = 5.295/4 = 1.32375\n     hour23: (0.036, -0.178, 2.239, 5.188) -> (0.036-0.178+2.239+5.188)/4 = 7.285/4 = 1.82125\n\n 23. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-08-21 to 2017-08-24) will be:\n\n      Day1: 2017-08-21 (Monday): [0.87075, 0.85275, 0.51525, ... up to 1.82125]\n      Day2: 2017-08-22 (Tuesday): same pattern\n      Day3: 2017-08-23 (Wednesday): same pattern\n      Day4: 2017-08-24 (Thursday): same pattern\n\n 24. But note: the 24th is a Thursday and we have a Thursday (17th) in the data. However, we are using the average of 4 days including Sunday which was high. \n     This might be acceptable? \n\n 25. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2017-08-21 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n\n 26. Format the data: we must output in the same format as the input, with two columns: 'date' and 'MULL'\n\n 27. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n 28. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but in the provided data there are none. We are to forecast without missing. \n\n 29. We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n 30. Let's write the forecast:\n\n     Day1: 2017-08-21\n        00:00:00 -> 0.871\n        01:00:00 -> 0.853\n        02:00:00 -> 0.515\n        03:00:00 -> 0.888\n        04:00:00 -> 0.995\n        05:00:00 -> 0.453\n        06:00:00 -> 0.329\n        07:00:00 -> 0.826\n        08:00:00 -> 0.666\n        09:00:00 -> 1.217\n        10:00:00 -> 2.398\n        11:00:00 -> 2.345\n        12:00:00 -> 1.937\n        13:00:00 -> 1.786\n        14:00:00 -> 3.331\n        15:00:00 -> 1.537\n        16:00:00 -> 0.364\n        17:00:00 -> 0.062\n        18:00:00 -> -0.631\n        19:00:00 -> -0.737\n        20:00:00 -> 0.168\n        21:00:00 -> 0.338\n        22:00:00 -> 1.324\n        23:00:00 -> 1.821\n\n     Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 31. But note: the 24th is Thursday and the 17th was Thursday. The average we computed includes the 17th. So it's okay.\n\n 32. We must output 96 points.\n\n 33. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 34. We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\n        date                 MULL\n        2017-08-21 00:00:00  0.871\n        2017-08-21 01:00:00  0.853\n        ... for 96 points\n    ```\n\n 35. But note: the input had the date as index? But the output should have two columns: one for date and one for MULL.\n\n 36. We'll output as:\n\n        date                MULL\n        2017-08-21 00:00:00 0.871\n        2017-08-21 01:00:00 0.853\n        ...\n\n 37. We'll generate the next 96 hours starting from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n\n 38. Let's code the pattern:\n\n        pattern = [\n            0.871, 0.853, 0.515, 0.888, 0.995, 0.453, 0.329, 0.826, \n            0.666, 1.217, 2.398, 2.345, 1.937, 1.786, 3.331, 1.537,\n            0.364, 0.062, -0.631, -0.737, 0.168, 0.338, 1.324, 1.821\n        ]\n\n     Then for day1: 2017-08-21: pattern\n          day2: 2017-08-22: same pattern\n          day3: 2017-08-23: same pattern\n          day4: 2017-08-24: same pattern\n\n 39. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 40. Write the data.\n\n However, note: the input had negative values and up to 3 decimal places. We are rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n 41. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime: 2017-08-21 00:00:00, then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 42. We'll write the answer accordingly.\n\n 43.
