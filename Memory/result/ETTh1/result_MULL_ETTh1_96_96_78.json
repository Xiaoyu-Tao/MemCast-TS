        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-09 00:00:00 to 2017-05-12 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete? We are told to be aware of missing values, but the given data does not have any missing values in the provided 96 points.\n 3. We must generate 96 forecasted values starting from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data is at hourly intervals, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps ahead.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern (lower values during the day and higher at night? Actually, looking at the data, the pattern is not very clear but there is some periodicity).\n   - We have only 4 days of data (96 hours) which is very limited.\n\n Given the constraints, we can try to model the time series with a simple model that captures:\n   - Trend: if any (but 4 days might not show a strong trend)\n   - Seasonality: daily seasonality (period=24)\n\n But note: the data is from 2017-05-09 to 2017-05-12 (4 days). We are to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Due to the limited data, we might use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the same hour in the previous day? But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the past 4 days? \n   - Or use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.\n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can use the given data as is.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete set of 96 points, we choose a simple method that can be implemented quickly and is robust.\n\n We will use:\n   - A seasonal decomposition to remove the seasonality and then model the remainder? But with only 4 days, decomposition might be unstable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average model with seasonality.\n\n Since the data is very short, we can use the average of the same hour over the available days to forecast the next days.\n\n Steps for a simple model:\n   - We have 4 days: day0 (2017-05-09), day1 (2017-05-10), day2 (2017-05-11), day3 (2017-05-12)\n   - For each hour (0 to 23) in the next day (2017-05-13), we can take the average of that hour from the past 4 days? \n     But note: the pattern might change? We don't have a long history.\n\n   However, we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). We can do:\n\n     For hour h (0<=h<24) in the next 4 days (day4, day5, day6, day7) we can do:\n\n        forecast for day4, hour h = average of day0, day1, day2, day3 at hour h\n        forecast for day5, hour h = average of day1, day2, day3, day4 at hour h? But we don't have day4.\n\n   So we can only use the available 4 days for the entire forecast? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days? i.e., the forecast for each day is the average of the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n   Let F(d, h) = average of MULL at hour h for d in {0,1,2,3} (where d0=2017-05-09, d1=2017-05-10, d2=2017-05-11, d3=2017-05-12)\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (d4, d5, d6, d7) we set:\n        MULL(d4, h) = F(d0, h)   [or the average?]\n\n   But note: we have 4 days, so we can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        F(h) = (MULL(d0, h) + MULL(d1, h) + MULL(d2, h) + MULL(d3, h)) / 4\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast period (4 days) and for each hour h, we use F(h).\n\n   However, this will give the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   But is that reasonable? The data does not have a strong trend? Let's check:\n\n        The values at 00:00: \n          2017-05-09: 1.883\n          2017-05-10: 1.564\n          2017-05-11: 1.457\n          2017-05-12: 0.924 -> decreasing? \n\n        So there might be a downward trend? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a linear trend for each hour? But with 4 points per hour, it's not much.\n\n   We can also consider a model that uses the last day (day3) as the forecast? But that would be a seasonal naive with lag 24.\n\n   However, the problem requires 96 points and we must provide a complete set.\n\n   Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have limited data, we choose:\n\n        Method 1: Use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        Method 2: Use a seasonal naive forecast: use the last day (2017-05-12) repeated for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 copies of the same day? \n\n        But the data does not look exactly the same each day.\n\n   We can try to capture the trend by taking a moving average and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n   However, we are constrained by the data.\n\n   Let's try to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.883 + 1.564 + 1.457 + 0.924) / 4 = (1.883+1.564=3.447; 3.447+1.457=4.904; 4.904+0.924=5.828) -> 5.828/4 = 1.457\n        hour1: (2.132+1.492+1.350+1.173)/4 = (2.132+1.492=3.624; 3.624+1.350=4.974; 4.974+1.173=6.147) -> 6.147/4=1.53675\n\n   But note: the last day (2017-05-12) has a lower value? So the average might be a bit high for the next days? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality? But we don't have enough data for that.\n\n   Given the instructions and the need for a complete answer, we will use the average method.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days (2017-05-13 to 2017-05-16), each day will have the same 24 values (the computed averages for hour0 to hour23).\n\n   But note: the data has a decreasing trend? We might adjust by the overall trend.\n\n   We can compute the overall trend by fitting a linear regression to the entire 96 points? Then adjust the average by the projected trend?\n\n   However, with only 4 days, the trend might be linear? \n\n   Let y = a + b * t, where t is the time index (0 to 95).\n\n   Then for the next 96 points (t=96 to 191), we can compute the trend component and then add the seasonal component (the average for that hour).\n\n   But we have to separate the trend and the seasonality.\n\n   We do:\n\n        Step 1: Decompose the time series into trend and seasonal and residual.\n\n        However, with only 4 days, we can do:\n\n          Let T(t) = linear trend: we fit a line to the 96 points.\n\n          Then subtract T(t) to get detrended data.\n\n          Then for each hour, compute the detrended value and average the detrended values for the same hour.\n\n        Then for forecasting:\n\n          For time t (from 96 to 191), we compute:\n             y_hat(t) = T(t) + S(t mod 24)\n\n        How to get T(t)? We can use linear regression.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n          x = [0,1,...,95]\n          y = the MULL values\n\n          We fit: y = a + b*x\n\n        Then T(t) = a + b*t\n\n        Then for each hour h (0<=h<24), we have 4 observations for that hour (one per day). We compute the average of the detrended values for hour h.\n\n        Then for a future time t, we know the hour h = t mod 24, and we set S(h) = average_detrended for that hour.\n\n        Then the forecast is: T(t) + S(h)\n\n        But note: the trend might be negative? and we are projecting 96 steps ahead? The trend might become negative and the forecast might go negative? But the MULL values are positive.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use additive decomposition with moving average for trend? But with 4 days, we can use a moving window of 24 to get a daily trend? \n\n        However, we are constrained by time and simplicity.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        Fit a linear trend to the 96 points.\n\n        Then compute the seasonal indices for each hour by averaging the detrended values for that hour.\n\n        Then forecast the next 96 points by:\n\n            y_hat(t) = T(t) + S(t mod 24)\n\n        But note: the trend might be overfitted? and the seasonal indices are based on only 4 points per hour.\n\n   Given the data, we try:\n\n        Step 1: Fit linear regression to the 96 points.\n\n        Step 2: Detrend the series.\n\n        Step 3: For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of the detrended values for that hour.\n\n        Step 4: For the next 96 points (t=96 to 191), compute:\n                T(t) = a + b*t\n                h = t mod 24\n                y_hat(t) = T(t) + S(h)\n\n        But note: the linear trend might be too strong? and the forecast might become negative? We can clip at 0? But the data has values as low as 0.036.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average method without trend? \n\n   We'll try both and see the behavior.\n\n   Without trend: the average for each hour is fixed. Then the forecast for the next 4 days is the same as the average of the past 4 days.\n\n   With trend: we project the trend forward. But the trend in the past 4 days is decreasing? \n\n        Let's compute the linear regression:\n\n            x = [0,1,...,95]\n            y = [1.883, 2.132, ... , 0.497] (96 points)\n\n        We can compute the slope and intercept.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            n = 96\n            sum_x = n*(n-1)/2 = 96*95/2 = 4560\n            sum_y = sum of all 96 MULL values\n            sum_xy = sum_{i=0}^{95} i * y_i\n            sum_x2 = (n-1)*n*(2*n-1)/6 = 95*96*191/6 = 95*16*191 = 95*3056 = 290320? \n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n            sum_x = 0+1+...+95 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n            sum_x2 = 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = (95*96*191)/6 = (95*16*191) = 290320\n\n        Then:\n            b = (n * sum_xy - sum_x * sum_y) / (n * sum_x2 - sum_x^2)\n            a = (sum_y - b * sum_x) / n\n\n        But we don't have the exact sum_y and sum_xy? We have to compute.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a simple method: the average method without trend.\n\n   Given the time, and the fact that the data is short and the trend might not be linear, we choose the average method without trend.\n\n   We'll compute the average for each hour and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For h in 0..23:\n            values = [ data[i*24 + h] for i in [0,1,2,3] ]\n            avg_h = mean(values)\n\n        Then the next 4 days: \n            day4: [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n            day5: [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n            day6: [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n            day7: [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n\n   This will give 96 points.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n        Hour 0: (1.883 + 1.564 + 1.457 + 0.924) / 4 = (1.883+1.564=3.447;

Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MULL\n        2017-05-13 00:00:00, 1.457\n        2017-05-13 01:00:00, 1.53675\n        ... \n        2017-05-16 23:00:00, 0.52375\n\n   But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimal places? \n\n   The original data had up to 3 decimal places. So we round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let's recompute the averages and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n        Hour0: 1.457 -> 1.457\n        Hour1: 1.53675 -> 1.537\n        Hour2: 1.33275 -> 1.333\n        Hour3: 1.51925 -> 1.519\n        Hour4: 1.5365 -> 1.536\n        Hour5: 1.58125 -> 1.581\n        Hour6: 1.4035 -> 1.404\n        Hour7: 0.924 -> 0.924\n        Hour8: 0.7195 -> 0.720\n        Hour9: 0.7995 -> 0.800\n        Hour10: 0.73725 -> 0.737\n        Hour11: 1.40375 -> 1.404\n        Hour12: 0.853 -> 0.853\n        Hour13: 1.13675 -> 1.137\n        Hour14: 1.013 -> 1.013\n        Hour15: 0.8885 -> 0.889\n        Hour16: 0.77275 -> 0.773\n        Hour17: 0.60425 -> 0.604\n        Hour18: 0.48825 -> 0.488\n        Hour19: 0.524 -> 0.524\n        Hour20: 0.444 -> 0.444\n        Hour21: 0.45275 -> 0.453\n        Hour22: 0.382 -> 0.382\n        Hour23: 0.52375 -> 0.524\n\n   Then we create the next 96 points by repeating these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n   We write the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-13 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-05-13 01:00:00, ... until 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        for day_offset in 0 to 3:\n            for hour in 0 to 23:\n                date = 2017-05-13 + day_offset days, and then set the hour\n                value = the rounded average for that hour\n\n   We note: 2017-05-13 is the next day after 2017-05-12.\n\n   We'll write the data in the same format as the input.\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's code it in the answer.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,MULL\n        2017-05-13 00:00:00,1.457\n        2017-05-13 01:00:00,1.537\n        ... \n        2017-05-16 23:00:00,0.524\n\n   However, the original input had a space between the date and the value? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2017-05-09 00:00:00 1.883\"\n\n   But the output format in the example was:\n\n        \"2017-05-09 00:00:00 1.883\"\n\n   But the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\"\n\n        <answer>\n\n        ...\n\n        </answer>\n\n   And the example in the data had two columns: date and MULL, separated by space? Actually, the example had:\n\n        \"2017-05-09 00:00:00 1.883\"\n\n   But the header was: \"date  MULL\"\n\n   We'll output without a header? The problem says \"complete data\", and the input had a header? But the example output in the problem did not show a header? \n\n   The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n   And the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-05-09 00:00:00 1.883\"\n\n   So we output without header? \n\n   We'll output the 96 lines in the same format: \n\n        [date string] [space] [value]\n\n   We'll generate the date strings as:\n\n        from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017,5,12) + timedelta(days=1) -> 2017-05-13\n\n   Then for each of the 4 days, and for each hour in 0..23.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        for day in range(0,4):\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = (datetime(2017,5,12) + timedelta(days=day+1, hours=hour)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                value = the value for that hour (from the list of 24 values we computed)\n\n   But note: we start at 2017-05-13 00:00:00, which is 2017-05-12 00:00:00 + 1 day and 0 hours? \n\n        Actually, 2017-05-12 23:00:00 + 1 hour = 2017-05-13 00:00:00.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017,5,13,0,0,0)\n        then for i in range(0,96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            hour_of_day = i % 24\n            value = avg_list[hour_of_day]\n\n   Then we write:\n\n        current_date_str = current_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        then the value\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Let's code the list of averages (rounded to 3 decimals) for hours 0 to 23:\n\n        avg_list = [\n            1.457,  # hour0\n            1.537,  # hour1\n            1.333,  # hour2\n            1.519,  # hour3\n            1.536,  # hour4\n            1.581,  # hour5\n            1.404,  # hour6\n            0.924,  # hour7\n            0.720,  # hour8\n            0.800,  # hour9\n            0.737,  # hour10\n            1.404,  # hour11\n            0.853,  # hour12\n            1.137,  # hour13\n            1.013,  # hour14\n            0.889,  # hour15\n            0.773,  # hour16\n            0.604,  # hour17\n            0.488,  # hour18\n            0.524,  # hour19\n            0.444,  # hour20\n            0.453,  # hour21\n            0.382,  # hour22\n            0.524   # hour23\n        ]\n\n   Then we generate 96 points.\n\n   We'll write the data in the answer.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
