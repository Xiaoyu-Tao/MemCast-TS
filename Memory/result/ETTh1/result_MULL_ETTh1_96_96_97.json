        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-24 00:00:00 to 2017-07-27 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-28 00:00:00 to 2017-07-31 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any missing values in the training data, but here we don't have any in the given segment.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations every 24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the constraints of the problem and that we are to provide a complete forecast without missing values, we can use a simple but effective method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (24 hours) as the forecast for the next season? But note: we have 4 days (96 hours) and we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). \n      However, the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonality. But without the ability to run code, we have to rely on a simple method.\n\n 5. Considering the requirement to provide the complete data and the fact that we are in a simulated environment, we can use a naive seasonal approach:\n\n    Forecast for 2017-07-28 00:00:00 = value of 2017-07-24 00:00:00 (i.e., 2.701)\n    Forecast for 2017-07-28 01:00:00 = value of 2017-07-24 01:00:00 (2.061)\n    ... until 2017-07-28 23:00:00 = value of 2017-07-24 23:00:00 (0.249)\n\n    Then for the next day (2017-07-29) we can use the same pattern from 2017-07-25? But note: the pattern might be changing.\n\n 6. However, looking at the data, the values are not exactly repeating. We can try to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But we only have 4 days.\n\n    Let's break the data into 4 days (each 24 hours). We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        For hour 0: (2.701 + 0.213 + 1.741 + 2.452) / 4 = ?\n        Similarly for hour 1: (2.061 + 0.888 + 2.736 + 1.812) / 4 = ?\n\n    Then we repeat the same 4 times (for 4 days) to get 96 points.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can use the average method.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-07-27) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that might not capture the overall average.\n\n 9. Given the time and the requirement, I choose the average method for each hour of the day.\n\n    We have 4 days: Day1: 2017-07-24, Day2: 2017-07-25, Day3: 2017-07-26, Day4: 2017-07-27.\n\n    For each hour h (0 to 23), we compute:\n        avg_h = (value_h of Day1 + value_h of Day2 + value_h of Day3 + value_h of Day4) / 4\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n        Day5 (2017-07-28): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n        Day6 (2017-07-29): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n        Day7 (2017-07-30): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n        Day8 (2017-07-31): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n\n 10. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (2.701 + 0.213 + 1.741 + 2.452) / 4 = (2.701+0.213=2.914; 2.914+1.741=4.655; 4.655+2.452=7.107) -> 7.107/4 = 1.77675\n     Hour 1: (2.061 + 0.888 + 2.736 + 1.812) / 4 = (2.061+0.888=2.949; 2.949+2.736=5.685; 5.685+1.812=7.497) -> 7.497/4 = 1.87425\n     ... and so on.\n\n 11. Since we are to provide the data, we must compute all 24 hourly averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 12. However, note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We are using a constant seasonal pattern.\n\n 13. We'll compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) and then create the forecast.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not given any in the training set, but if we were, we would have to impute. Since we don't, we proceed.\n\n 15. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (2.701, 0.213, 1.741, 2.452) -> (2.701+0.213+1.741+2.452)/4 = 7.107/4 = 1.77675\n     Hour 1: (2.061, 0.888, 2.736, 1.812) -> (2.061+0.888+2.736+1.812) = 7.497/4 = 1.87425\n     Hour 2: (1.421, 0.782, 2.523, 1.102) -> (1.421+0.782+2.523+1.102)=5.828/4=1.457\n     Hour 3: (1.066, 0.711, 1.457, 2.310) -> (1.066+0.711+1.457+2.310)=5.544/4=1.386\n     Hour 4: (2.132, -0.497, 0.497, 1.954) -> (2.132-0.497+0.497+1.954)= (2.132+1.954)=4.086/4=1.0215\n     Hour 5: (0.959, 0.746, 0.107, 1.635) -> (0.959+0.746+0.107+1.635)=3.447/4=0.86175\n     Hour 6: (0.569, -0.142, 0.604, 0.604) -> (0.569-0.142+0.604+0.604)=1.635/4=0.40875\n     Hour 7: (1.457, 0.888, 0.888, 1.777) -> (1.457+0.888+0.888+1.777)=5.01/4=1.2525\n     Hour 8: (1.599, 1.741, 1.137, 2.239) -> (1.599+1.741+1.137+2.239)=6.716/4=1.679\n     Hour 9: (1.137, 1.741, 1.564, 1.208) -> (1.137+1.741+1.564+1.208)=5.65/4=1.4125\n     Hour 10: (2.310, 2.097, 2.487, 2.061) -> (2.310+2.097+2.487+2.061)=8.955/4=2.23875\n     Hour 11: (3.340, 3.056, 2.559, 2.985) -> (3.340+3.056+2.559+2.985)=11.94/4=2.985\n     Hour 12: (3.376, 3.127, 2.878, 3.553) -> (3.376+3.127+2.878+3.553)=12.934/4=3.2335\n     Hour 13: (3.376, 3.020, 3.340, 3.411) -> (3.376+3.020+3.340+3.411)=13.147/4=3.28675\n     Hour 14: (3.234, 2.630, 2.736, 2.736) -> (3.234+2.630+2.736+2.736)=11.336/4=2.834\n     Hour 15: (1.848, 1.386, 1.315, 1.848) -> (1.848+1.386+1.315+1.848)=6.397/4=1.59925\n     Hour 16: (1.670, 1.137, 1.031, 0.675) -> (1.670+1.137+1.031+0.675)=4.513/4=1.12825\n     Hour 17: (0.888, 0.355, 0.391, 0.178) -> (0.888+0.355+0.391+0.178)=1.812/4=0.453\n     Hour 18: (0.497, -0.391, -0.462, -0.284) -> (0.497-0.391-0.462-0.284)= (0.497-1.137)= -0.64/4=-0.16\n     Hour 19: (-0.178, -0.426, -0.142, -0.036) -> (-0.178-0.426-0.142-0.036)= -0.782/4=-0.1955\n     Hour 20: (0.604, 0.178, 0.107, 0.497) -> (0.604+0.178+0.107+0.497)=1.386/4=0.3465\n     Hour 21: (0.213, 0.853, 0.178, 0.178) -> (0.213+0.853+0.178+0.178)=1.422/4=0.3555\n     Hour 22: (0.355, 0.355, 0.675, 0.533) -> (0.355+0.355+0.675+0.533)=1.918/4=0.4795\n     Hour 23: (0.249, 0.853, 0.888, 0.284) -> (0.249+0.853+0.888+0.284)=2.274/4=0.5685\n\n 16. Now, we create the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-07-28 to 2017-07-31) by repeating the above 24 values 4 times.\n\n 17. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n     Start: 2017-07-28 00:00:00 (next after 2017-07-27 23:00:00)\n     Then 2017-07-28 00:00:00, 2017-07-28 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-31 23:00:00.\n\n 18.

We'll round the values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 20. Let's write the forecast:\n\n     Day1 (2017-07-28):\n        00:00:00 -> 1.777\n        01:00:00 -> 1.874\n        02:00:00 -> 1.457\n        03:00:00 -> 1.386\n        04:00:00 -> 1.022\n        05:00:00 -> 0.862\n        06:00:00 -> 0.409\n        07:00:00 -> 1.253\n        08:00:00 -> 1.679\n        09:00:00 -> 1.413\n        10:00:00 -> 2.239\n        11:00:00 -> 2.985\n        12:00:00 -> 3.234\n        13:00:00 -> 3.287\n        14:00:00 -> 2.834\n        15:00:00 -> 1.599\n        16:00:00 -> 1.128\n        17:00:00 -> 0.453\n        18:00:00 -> -0.160\n        19:00:00 -> -0.196\n        20:00:00 -> 0.347\n        21:00:00 -> 0.356\n        22:00:00 -> 0.480\n        23:00:00 -> 0.569\n\n     Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 21.
