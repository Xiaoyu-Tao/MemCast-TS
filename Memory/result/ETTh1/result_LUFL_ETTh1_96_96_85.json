        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for LUFL (Low UseFul Load) from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We need to choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data size (96 points) and the hourly frequency, we can consider methods like:\n    - ARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because of the potential daily seasonality (24 hours in a day).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n    - Given the small data size, we might opt for a simpler model if the data does not show strong seasonality or trends.\n\n However, looking at the data, we observe:\n    - The data seems to have a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, the load is lower at night and higher during the day.\n\n 3. We will use a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. We need to determine the parameters: (p,d,q) for non-seasonal part and (P,D,Q,s) for seasonal part with s=24.\n\n 4. But note: we only have 4 days of data (96 hours). This is a very short time series for a model with daily seasonality (24 periods). \n    - We might face challenges in estimating a SARIMA model with 24 seasonal lags because we only have 4 cycles.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model such as Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, or even a non-seasonal ARIMA and then account for the time of day with dummy variables? \n    However, with only 4 days, we might not have enough data for complex models.\n\n 6. Another idea: use a naive seasonal method. For example, the forecast for the next 24 hours could be the same as the last 24 hours? But we are asked for 96 hours (4 days). \n    We can use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend and might not be accurate.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a model that captures the daily pattern and the autocorrelation. We'll use an automated approach to select the best SARIMA model.\n\n However, note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data we don't have any. So we can proceed.\n\n 8. We'll use the `pmdarima` library in Python which can automatically select the best ARIMA parameters. But since we are in a text-based environment, we have to run the model in our mind.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days. We can use the average of the same hour for the available days.\n\n    For example, for hour 00:00:00, we have 4 values: \n        2017-06-06 00:00:00 -> 1.706\n        2017-06-07 00:00:00 -> 2.041\n        2017-06-08 00:00:00 -> 2.071\n        2017-06-09 00:00:00 -> 2.498\n\n    The average for 00:00:00 is (1.706+2.041+2.071+2.498)/4 = 2.079\n\n    Then for the next day at 00:00:00 (2017-06-10 00:00:00) we can use 2.079.\n\n    Similarly, for 01:00:00: \n        2017-06-06 01:00:00 -> 1.675\n        2017-06-07 01:00:00 -> 1.888\n        2017-06-08 01:00:00 -> 2.193\n        2017-06-09 01:00:00 -> 2.193\n        Average = (1.675+1.888+2.193+2.193)/4 = 1.98725\n\n    And so on for each hour of the day.\n\n 10. But this method ignores any trend. We can also consider a moving average or exponential smoothing per hour.\n\n 11. Given the very limited data, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the next 4 days. This is a simple but often effective method for short-term forecasting when the series has a strong daily pattern and we have multiple cycles.\n\n 12. We will compute the average for each of the 24 hours in a day using the 4 available days.\n\n 13. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will use the same 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 14. However, note that the data we have is from 4 consecutive days: Tuesday (2017-06-06), Wednesday (2017-06-07), Thursday (2017-06-08), Friday (2017-06-09). \n     The next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. There might be weekly patterns, but we don't have weekly data to capture that. So we ignore weekly seasonality.\n\n 15. Steps for calculation:\n     - Group the data by hour of the day (i.e., 0 to 23).\n     - For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n 16. Then, for the next 96 hours (starting at 2017-06-10 00:00:00, which is a Saturday, and ending at 2017-06-13 23:00:00, which is a Tuesday), we assign:\n        Hour 0 (00:00): average for hour0\n        Hour 1: average for hour1\n        ...\n        Hour 23: average for hour23\n     and then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 17. This method is simple and we have exactly 4 days to forecast, so we can repeat the daily pattern 4 times.\n\n 18. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00): [1.706, 2.041, 2.071, 2.498] -> (1.706+2.041+2.071+2.498)/4 = 8.316/4 = 2.079\n     Hour 1 (01:00): [1.675, 1.888, 2.193, 2.193] -> (1.675+1.888+2.193+2.193)/4 = 7.949/4 = 1.98725\n     Hour 2 (02:00): [1.919, 1.888, 2.163, 2.315] -> (1.919+1.888+2.163+2.315)/4 = 8.285/4 = 2.07125\n     Hour 3 (03:00): [1.949, 1.888, 1.888, 2.254] -> (1.949+1.888+1.888+2.254)/4 = 7.979/4 = 1.99475\n     Hour 4 (04:00): [1.797, 1.797, 2.254, 2.041] -> (1.797+1.797+2.254+2.041)/4 = 7.889/4 = 1.97225\n     Hour 5 (05:00): [2.376, 2.985, 2.924, 2.772] -> (2.376+2.985+2.924+2.772)/4 = 11.057/4 = 2.76425\n     Hour 6 (06:00): [2.741, 3.107, 3.198, 2.985] -> (2.741+3.107+3.198+2.985)/4 = 12.031/4 = 3.00775\n     Hour 7 (07:00): [2.619, 2.741, 3.015, 2.985] -> (2.619+2.741+3.015+2.985)/4 = 11.36/4 = 2.84\n     Hour 8 (08:00): [2.315, 3.076, 3.290, 3.107] -> (2.315+3.076+3.290+3.107)/4 = 11.788/4 = 2.947\n     Hour 9 (09:00): [2.193, 2.985, 2.741, 2.985] -> (2.193+2.985+2.741+2.985)/4 = 10.904/4 = 2.726\n     Hour 10 (10:00): [2.802, 3.320, 3.533, 3.137] -> (2.802+3.320+3.533+3.137)/4 = 12.792/4 = 3.198\n     Hour 11 (11:00): [3.076, 3.442, 3.290, 3.168] -> (3.076+3.442+3.290+3.168)/4 = 12.976/4 = 3.244\n     Hour 12 (12:00): [2.284, 2.924, 2.559, 2.680] -> (2.284+2.924+2.559+2.680)/4 = 10.447/4 = 2.61175\n     Hour 13 (13:00): [2.132, 2.163, 2.467, 2.467] -> (2.132+2.163+2.467+2.467)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725\n     Hour 14 (14:00): [1.949, 2.254, 2.467, 2.559] -> (1.949+2.254+2.467+2.559)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725\n     Hour 15 (15:00): [2.224, 2.345, 2.406, 2.467] -> (2.224+2.345+2.406+2.467)/4 = 9.442/4 = 2.3605\n     Hour 16 (16:00): [2.284, 2.680, 2.559, 2.437] -> (2.284+2.680+2.559+2.437)/4 = 9.96/4 = 2.49\n     Hour 17 (17:00): [2.711, 2.924, 2.924, 2.955] -> (2.711+2.924+2.924+2.955)/4 = 11.514/4 = 2.8785\n     Hour 18 (18:00): [2.772, 2.772, 2.863, 2.680] -> (2.772+2.772+2.863+2.680)/4 = 11.087/4 = 2.77175\n     Hour 19 (19:00): [2.345, 2.711, 2.863, 2.589] -> (2.345+2.711+2.863+2.589)/4 = 10.508/4 = 2.627\n     Hour 20 (20:00): [2.650, 2.924, 3.076, 3.015] -> (2.650+2.924+3.076+3.015)/4 = 11.665/4 = 2.91625\n     Hour 21 (21:00): [2.619, 2.802, 3.229, 2.711] -> (2.619+2.802+3.229+2.711)/4 = 11.361/4 = 2.84025\n     Hour 22 (22:00): [2.163, 2.376, 2.924, 2.650] -> (2.163+2.376+2.924+2.650)/4 = 10.113/4 = 2.52825\n     Hour 23 (23:00): [2.041, 2.376, 2.437, 2.498] -> (2.041+2.376+2.437+2.498)/4 = 9.352/4 = 2.338\n\n 19. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-06-10 (Saturday) from 00:00 to 23:00: use the 24 averages we computed.\n     Day 2: 2017-06-11 (Sunday): same 24 averages.\n     Day 3: 2017-06-12 (Monday): same 24 averages.\n     Day 4: 2017-06-13 (Tuesday): same 24 averages.\n\n 20. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are generating the forecast without any missing values. So we output 96 complete records.\n\n 21. Format: We must output the date and LUFL value for each hour, starting from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We write the data in the same format as the input, with the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the LUFL value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 23. We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n     Start: 2017-06-10 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-06-10 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-13 23:00:00.\n\n 24. The LUFL values will be:\n\n     2017-06-10 00:00:00 -> 2.079\n     2017-06-10 01:00:00 -> 1.987\n     2017-06-10 02:00:00 -> 2.071\n     ... and so on.\n\n 25. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 26. However, note: the averages we computed have more than 3 decimal places. We'll round them to 3.\n\n 27. Let's list the 24 average values rounded to 3 decimal places:\n\n     Hour0: 2.079 -> 2.079\n     Hour1: 1.98725 -> 1.987\n     Hour2: 2.07125 -> 2.071\n     Hour3: 1.99475 -> 1.995\n     Hour4: 1.97225 -> 1.972\n     Hour5: 2.76425 -> 2.764\n     Hour6: 3.00775 -> 3.008\n     Hour7: 2.84 -> 2.840\n     Hour8: 2.947 -> 2.947\n     Hour9: 2.726 -> 2.726\n     Hour10: 3.198 -> 3.198\n     Hour11: 3.244 -> 3.244\n     Hour12: 2.61175 -> 2.612\n     Hour13: 2.30725 -> 2.307\n     Hour14: 2.30725 -> 2.307\n     Note: Hour13 and Hour14 are the same by coincidence? Actually, we computed:\n        Hour13: (2.132+2.163+2.467+2.467)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725 -> 2.307\n        Hour14: (1.949+2.254+2.467+2.559)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725 -> 2.307\n     Hour15: 2.3605 -> 2.361\n     Hour16: 2.49 -> 2.490\n     Hour17: 2.8785 -> 2.879\n     Hour18: 2.77175 -> 2.772\n     Hour19: 2.627 -> 2.627\n     Hour20: 2.91625 -> 2.916\n     Hour21: 2.84025 -> 2.840\n     Hour22: 2.52825 -> 2.528\n     Hour23: 2.338 -> 2.338\n\n 28. Now, we'll generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day1: 2017-06-10 (hour0 to hour23): [2.079, 1.987, 2.071, 1.995, 1.972, 2.764, 3.008, 2.840, 2.947, 2.726, 3.198, 3.244, 2.612, 2.307, 2.307, 2.361, 2.490, 2.879, 2.772, 2.627, 2.916, 2.840, 2.528, 2.338]\n     Day2: 2017-06-11: same sequence\n     Day3: 2017-06-12: same sequence\n     Day4: 2017-06-13: same sequence\n\n 29. Write the data in the required format.\n\n 30. Note: The problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast. So we output 96 complete records.\n\n 31.
