        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the need for a robust method, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. We must be cautious: the data has a clear daily pattern (temperature rises during the day and falls at night) and also some irregularities (like the drop on 2017-10-05 04:00:00 to 3.588).\n\n 5. We will use the following approach:\n    - Preprocess: Check for missing values in the provided data? (But the given 96 points are complete.)\n    - Model: We choose SARIMA because it can capture both non-seasonal and seasonal patterns.\n\n 6. We need to select parameters for SARIMA: (p,d,q) for non-seasonal and (P,D,Q,s) for seasonal part. Since seasonality is 24, s=24.\n\n 7. We can perform a grid search for the best parameters, but due to the constraints of this format, we will use a reasonable set of parameters.\n\n    Observing the data: \n      - There is a clear daily pattern (seasonality of 24).\n      - The data does not show a strong upward or downward trend over the 4 days, so we might set d=0 or 1 and D=1 (for seasonal differencing). \n      - We note that the series is not stationary (mean and variance change with time of day). We will take one seasonal difference (D=1) and maybe one non-seasonal difference (d=0 or 1).\n\n    We can try: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1,24) or similar.\n\n 8. However, without automatic model selection, we rely on typical patterns. We'll use:\n      - d = 0 or 1? Let's check stationarity. The mean seems to be changing with the day, but the daily pattern is consistent. We can try d=0 and D=1.\n      - We'll use p=1, q=1, P=1, Q=1.\n\n 9. We'll fit the model and then forecast 96 steps.\n\n10. But note: the data has a drop on 2017-10-05 (values around 3.5) which is an outlier? We might need to handle it. However, without more context, we proceed.\n\n11. Alternatively, we can use a simpler approach: \n      - Use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? \n      - But we are required to provide a complete set of 96 forecasted values.\n\n12. Given the constraints of this environment, we will use the `statsmodels` library in a simulated way. However, since we cannot run code, we must rely on a precomputed forecast.\n\n    But note: We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate the dates and the forecasted OT.\n\n13. We generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 (the last given point is 2017-10-07 23:00:00) and then every hour until 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n14. We will simulate the forecast by using a naive method? But that would not be accurate. However, we are limited.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But that ignores trends.\n\n15. Given the complexity, we are to provide an answer, we will use a simple seasonal naive method: \n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 available days (2017-10-04 to 2017-10-07) and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours = 96):\n      - For hour 0: average of [2017-10-04 00:00:00, 2017-10-05 00:00:00, 2017-10-06 00:00:00, 2017-10-07 00:00:00] = (6.894, 5.839, 10.200, 10.622) -> (6.894+5.839+10.200+10.622)/4 = 8.38875\n      - Similarly for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n    But note: the data on 2017-10-05 has a drop at 04:00, 05:00, 06:00 to around 3.5, which might be an anomaly. If we average, it will pull down the forecast for those hours.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the outlier? But the problem says there are missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have missing, but we have an outlier.\n\n    We are not told to clean the data, so we use the average.\n\n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n16. We decide to use the average by hour for the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the last day (2017-10-07) has a higher temperature? We see an increasing trend? \n        For example, at 00:00: \n            2017-10-04: 6.894\n            2017-10-05: 5.839\n            2017-10-06: 10.200\n            2017-10-07: 10.622 -> average 8.38875\n\n        Then for 2017-10-08 00:00:00: 8.38875? \n        But if there is an increasing trend, we might adjust. However, the data is only 4 days and the drop on 2017-10-05 is significant.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last two days? But the problem does not specify.\n\n17. We choose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n18. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days and then replicate that pattern for the next 4 days (2017-10-08 to 2017-10-11).\n\n19. Steps to compute:\n      - Group the 96 points by hour of day (0 to 23). We have 4 points for each hour (from 4 days).\n      - For each hour, compute the mean.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Days: 2017-10-04, 2017-10-05, 2017-10-06, 2017-10-07: [6.894, 5.839, 10.200, 10.622] -> mean = (6.894+5.839+10.200+10.622)/4 = 33.555/4 = 8.38875\n\n    For hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        [6.753, 6.050, 10.271, 10.130] -> (6.753+6.050+10.271+10.130)/4 = 33.204/4 = 8.301\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n20. Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating these 24 hourly means for 4 days.\n\n21. However, note that the data might have a trend? But we are not accounting for it. This method is simple and captures the daily pattern.\n\n22. We must generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-10-08 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n23. We compute the 24 means:\n\n    Hour 0: 8.38875\n    Hour 1: 8.301\n    Hour 2: (7.879, 5.698, 9.989, 10.271) -> (7.879+5.698+9.989+10.271)/4 = 33.837/4 = 8.45925\n    Hour 3: (7.879, 5.417, 10.200, 10.341) -> (7.879+5.417+10.200+10.341)/4 = 33.837/4? Wait, 7.879+5.417=13.296, 10.200+10.341=20.541 -> total 33.837 -> 8.45925\n    Hour 4: (7.457, 3.588, 9.567, 9.989) -> (7.457+3.588+9.567+9.989)/4 = 30.601/4 = 7.65025\n    Hour 5: (7.035, 3.517, 9.778, 10.200) -> (7.035+3.517+9.778+10.200)/4 = 30.53/4 = 7.6325\n    Hour 6: (7.105, 3.588, 10.271, 10.482) -> (7.105+3.588+10.271+10.482)/4 = 31.446/4 = 7.8615\n    Hour 7: (7.386, 6.120, 10.552, 10.200) -> (7.386+6.120+10.552+10.200)/4 = 34.258/4 = 8.5645\n    Hour 8: (7.457, 5.909, 9.638, 9.989) -> (7.457+5.909+9.638+9.989)/4 = 32.993/4 = 8.24825\n    Hour 9: (7.879, 6.050, 10.341, 10.130) -> (7.879+6.050+10.341+10.130)/4 = 34.4/4 = 8.6\n    Hour 10: (8.090, 5.628, 10.763, 10.833) -> (8.090+5.628+10.763+10.833)/4 = 35.314/4 = 8.8285\n    Hour 11: (8.512, 6.894, 11.115, 10.833) -> (8.512+6.894+11.115+10.833)/4 = 37.354/4 = 9.3385\n    Hour 12: (9.356, 6.542, 10.833, 11.748) -> (9.356+6.542+10.833+11.748)/4 = 38.479/4 = 9.61975\n    Hour 13: (9.286, 5.417, 11.396, 13.788) -> (9.286+5.417+11.396+13.788)/4 = 39.887/4 = 9.97175\n    Hour 14: (9.426, 5.346, 11.537, 13.929) -> (9.426+5.346+11.537+13.929)/4 = 40.238/4 = 10.0595\n    Hour 15: (9.567, 6.683, 11.537, 13.858) -> (9.567+6.683+11.537+13.858)/4 = 41.645/4 = 10.41125\n    Hour 16: (8.793, 7.668, 11.115, 13.647) -> (8.793+7.668+11.115+13.647)/4 = 41.223/4 = 10.30575\n    Hour 17: (8.301, 8.442, 11.678, 13.718) -> (8.301+8.442+11.678+13.718)/4 = 42.139/4 = 10.53475\n    Hour 18: (8.160, 8.864, 11.467, 12.874) -> (8.160+8.864+11.467+12.874)/4 = 41.365/4 = 10.34125\n    Hour 19: (7.879, 9.004, 11.185, 12.522) -> (7.879+9.004+11.185+12.522)/4 = 40.59/4 = 10.1475\n    Hour 20: (7.105, 9.778, 11.185, 12.100) -> (7.105+9.778+11.185+12.100)/4 = 40.168/4 = 10.042\n    Hour 21: (6.683, 9.497, 11.396, 11.678) -> (6.683+9.497+11.396+11.678)/4 = 39.254/4 = 9.8135\n    Hour 22: (6.472, 9.497, 11.467, 11.537) -> (6.472+9.497+11.467+11.537)/4 = 38.973/4 = 9.74325\n    Hour 23: (6.261, 10.060, 11.396, 11.185) -> (6.261+10.060+11.396+11.185)/4 = 38.902/4 = 9.7255\n\n24. Now, we create the next 4 days (2017-10-08 to 2017-10-11) by repeating these 24 values for each day.\n\n    Day 1: 2017-10-08: [8.38875, 8.301, 8.45925, 8.45925, 7.65025, 7.6325, 7.8615, 8.5645, 8.24825, 8.6, 8.8285, 9.3385, 9.61975, 9.97175, 10.0595, 10.41125, 10.30575, 10.53475, 10.34125, 10.1475, 10.042, 9.8135, 9.74325, 9.7255]\n    Day 2: 2017-10-09: same 24 values\n    Day 3: 2017-10-10: same\n    Day 4: 2017-10-11: same\n\n25. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting without gaps. We are to provide 96 consecutive hours.\n\n26. We output the data in the required format: a table with two columns: \"date\" and \"OT\", for 96 rows.\n\n27. We round the OT values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n    However, note: the input has 3 decimal places. We computed the averages and then we round.\n\n    Example: 8.38875 -> 8.389 (if we round to 3 decimals) but the input has 3 decimal places. We see the input has 3 decimal places, so we round to 3.\n\n    But note: the input has values like 6.894, 6.753, etc. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n    We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n    For hour0: 8.38875 -> 8.389\n    hour1: 8.301 -> 8.301 (exactly)\n\n28. We generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-10-08 00:00:00\n    Then 2017-10-08 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-08 23:00:00\n    Then 2017-10-09 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n29. We write the data in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\n2017-10-08 00:00:00  8.389\n2017-10-08 01:00:00  8.301\n2017-10-08 02:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-08 03:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-08 04:00:00  7.650\n2017-10-08 05:00:00  7.633\n2017-10-08 06:00:00  7.862\n2017-10-08 07:00:00  8.565\n2017-10-08 08:00:00  8.248\n2017-10-08 09:00:00  8.600\n2017-10-08 10:00:00  8.829\n2017-10-08 11:00:00  9.339\n2017-10-08 12:00:00  9.620\n2017-10-08 13:00:00  9.972\n2017-10-08 14:00:00  10.060\n2017-10-08 15:00:00  10.411\n2017-10-08 16:00:00  10.306\n2017-10-08 17:00:00  10.535\n2017-10-08 18:00:00  10.341\n2017-10-08 19:00:00  10.148\n2017-10-08 20:00:00  10.042\n2017-10-08 21:00:00  9.814\n2017-10-08 22:00:00  9.743\n2017-10-08 23:00:00  9.726\n2017-10-09 00:00:00  8.389\n2017-10-09 01:00:00  8.301\n... until 2017-10-11 23:00:00\n\n```\n\n30. But note: we computed the averages and then rounded. We must be consistent.\n\n    However, we see that the input has 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n    We'll round each of the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Correction: \n        Hour4: 7.65025 -> 7.650\n        Hour5: 7.6325 -> 7.633 (because 7.6325 rounds to 7.633 when rounded to 3 decimals: 2.5 rounds to the nearest even? But 7.6325: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal from 2 to 3 -> 7.633)\n\n    But note: the input does not use rounding to even? It just has 3 decimal places. We'll use standard rounding.\n\n    We'll use: \n        round(8.38875, 3) -> 8.389\n        Because: 8.38875: look at the fourth decimal (7) which is >=5, so round up the third decimal (8 becomes 9) -> 8.389\n\n    Similarly, 7.6325: \n        The third decimal is 2, the fourth is 5 -> round up the 2 to 3 -> 7.633\n\n    We do this for every value.\n\n31. We list the 24 hourly averages rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n    Hour0: 8.38875 -> 8.389\n    Hour1: 8.301 -> 8.301\n    Hour2: 8.45925 -> 8.459\n    Hour3: 8.45925 -> 8.459\n    Hour4: 7.65025 -> 7.650\n    because: 7.65025 -> the fourth decimal is 2, which is <5, so we leave as 7.650? \n        But wait: 7.65025: \n            The number is 7.65025, to 3 decimals: we look at the fourth decimal (2) -> less than 5, so we leave the third decimal as 0 -> 7.650\n    Hour5: 7.6325 -> 7.633 (because 7.6325: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal: 2 becomes 3 -> 7.633)\n    Hour6: 7.8615 -> 7.862 (because 7.8615: the fourth decimal is 5, so round up the 1 to 2 -> 7.862)\n    Hour7: 8.5645 -> 8.565 (round up the 4 to 5 because next is 5 -> 8.565)\n    Hour8: 8.24825 -> 8.248 (because 8.24825: fourth decimal is 2 -> so 8.248)\n    Hour9: 8.6 -> 8.600 (but we have 8.6, which is 8.600 in three decimals)\n        Actually, 8.6 is 8.600, so we write 8.600? But the input does not have trailing zeros? \n        The input: 6.894, 6.753 -> they have three digits. So we should write 8.600? \n        However, the input also has 7.879, which is three decimals. So we write 8.600? \n        Alternatively, we can write 8.6 as 8.600? But the input does not pad with zeros. \n        We see: 6.894, 6.753, 7.879 -> they are given with three decimals. So we output three decimals.\n\n        How about 8.6? We can write 8.600? But that would be 4 digits? Actually, 8.600 is three decimals. \n        But the input does not have trailing zeros: for example, 7.035 -> that is 7.035, not 7.0350.\n\n        We'll output exactly three decimal places: so 8.6 becomes 8.600? \n        However, the input has 7.035 (which is three decimals) and 7.105 (three decimals). So we output three decimals.\n\n        But note: 8.6 is 8.600? We can represent it as 8.600 to keep consistency? \n        However, the input does not use trailing zeros: for example, 6.0 would be written as 6.000? \n        Actually, the input has 3.588, 3.517, 3.588 -> so they are three decimals.\n\n        We'll output three decimals by formatting to three decimal places.\n\n        So 8.6 -> 8.600? But that is not necessary. The input has 7.035 and 7.105, which are three decimals. \n        But 8.6 is 8.600? We can write it as 8.600 to have the same format? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write without trailing zeros? The input does not have trailing zeros? \n        Actually, the input has 6.0? No, it has 6.894, 6.753, ... all have three decimals.\n\n        We'll format every number to have three decimal places.\n\n        So:\n            Hour9: 8.6 -> 8.600\n\n    But wait, we computed average for hour9 was 8.6 exactly?\n        We computed: (7.879+6.050+10.341+10.130)/4 = (7.879+6.050=13.929, 10.341+10.130=20.471, total 34.4) -> 34.4/4=8.6 -> 8.600\n\n    So we write 8.600.\n\n    Similarly, we format every number to three decimals.\n\n    We recast the 24 hourly averages to three decimals:\n\n        Hour0: 8.389\n        Hour1: 8.301\n        Hour2: 8.459\n        Hour3: 8.459\n        Hour4: 7.650\n        Hour5: 7.633\n        Hour6: 7.862\n        Hour7: 8.565\n        Hour8: 8.248\n        Hour9: 8.600\n        Hour10: 8.829\n        Hour11: 9.339\n        Hour12: 9.620\n        Hour13: 9.972\n        Hour14: 10.060\n        Hour15: 10.411\n        Hour16: 10.306\n        Hour17: 10.535\n        Hour18: 10.341\n        Hour19: 10.148\n        Hour20: 10.042\n        Hour21: 9.814\n        Hour22: 9.743\n        Hour23: 9.726   [because 9.7255 -> rounding: 9.7255 -> look at the fourth decimal (5) -> round up the third decimal: 5 becomes 6 -> 9.726]\n\n    But wait: 9.7255: \n        The third decimal is 5, the fourth is 5 -> we round up the 5 to 6? \n        Actually, 9.7255: \n            The digit in the third decimal is 5, and the next is 5, so we round up: 9.726.\n\n32. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n    Day1: 2017-10-08: \n        00:00:00  8.389\n        01:00:00  8.301\n        02:00:00  8.459\n        03:00:00  8.459\n        04:00:00  7.650\n        05:00:00  7.633\n        06:00:00  7.862\n        07:00:00  8.565\n        08:00:00  8.248\n        09:00:00  8.600\n        10:00:00  8.829\n        11:00:00  9.339\n        12:00:00  9.620\n        13:00:00  9.972\n        14:00:00  10.060\n        15:00:00  10.411\n        16:00:00  10.306\n        17:00:00  10.535\n        18:00:00  10.341\n        19:00:00  10.148\n        20:00:00  10.042\n        21:00:00  9.814\n        22:00:00  9.743\n        23:00:00  9.726\n\n    Day2: 2017-10-09: same 24 values in the same order.\n\n    Day3: 2017-10-10: same.\n\n    Day4: 2017-10-11: same.\n\n33. We output the entire block in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple method and may not be the most accurate, especially given the outlier on 2017-10-05. But without a more sophisticated model, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\nWe write the answer in the format:\n\n<answer>\n\n```\n2017-10-08 00:00:00  8.389\n2017-10-08 01:00:00  8.301\n2017-10-08 02:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-08 03:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-08 04:00:00  7.650\n2017-10-08 05:00:00  7.633\n2017-10-08 06:00:00  7.862\n2017-10-08 07:00:00  8.565\n2017-10-08 08:00:00  8.248\n2017-10-08 09:00:00  8.600\n2017-10-08 10:00:00  8.829\n2017-10-08 11:00:00  9.339\n2017-10-08 12:00:00  9.620\n2017-10-08 13:00:00  9.972\n2017-10-08 14:00:00  10.060\n2017-10-08 15:00:00  10.411\n2017-10-08 16:00:00  10.306\n2017-10-08 17:00:00  10.535\n2017-10-08 18:00:00  10.341\n2017-10-08 19:00:00  10.148\n2017-10-08 20:00:00  10.042\n2017-10-08 21:00:00  9.814\n2017-10-08 22:00:00  9.743\n2017-10-08 23:00:00  9.726\n2017-10-09 00:00:00  8.389\n2017-10-09 01:00:00  8.301\n2017-10-09 02:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-09 03:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-09 04:00:00  7.650\n2017-10-09 05:00:00  7.633\n2017-10-09 06:00:00  7.862\n2017-10-09 07:00:00  8.565\n2017-10-09 08:00:00  8.248\n2017-10-09 09:00:00  8.600\n2017-10-09 10:00:00  8.829\n2017-10-09 11:00:00  9.339\n2017-10-09 12:00:00  9.620\n2017-10-09 13:00:00  9.972\n2017-10-09 14:00:00  10.060\n2017-10-09 15:00:00  10.411\n2017-10-09 16:00:00  10.306\n2017-10-09 17:00:00  10.535\n2017-10-09 18:00:00  10.341\n2017-10-09 19:00:00  10.148\n2017-10-09 20:00:00  10.042\n2017-10-09 21:00:00  9.814\n2017-10-09 22:00:00  9.743\n2017-10-09 23:00:00  9.726\n2017-10-10 00:00:00  8.389\n2017-10-10 01:00:00  8.301\n2017-10-10 02:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-10 03:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-10 04:00:00  7.650\n2017-10-10 05:00:00  7.633\n2017-10-10 06:00:00  7.862\n2017-10-10 07:00:00  8.565\n2017-10-10 08:00:00  8.248\n2017-10-10 09:00:00  8.600\n2017-10-10 10:00:00  8.829\n2017-10-10 11:00:00  9.339\n2017-10-10 12:00:00  9.620\n2017-10-10 13:00:00  9.972\n2017-10-10 14:00:00  10.060\n2017-10-10 15:00:00  10.411\n2017-10-10 16:00:00  10.306\n2017-10-10 17:00:00  10.535\n2017-10-10 18:00:00  10.341\n2017-10-10 19:00:00  10.148\n2017-10-10 20:00:00  10.042\n2017-10-10 21:00:00  9.814\n2017-10-10 22:00:00  9.743\n2017-10-10 23:00:00  9.726\n2017-10-11 00:00:00  8.389\n2017-10-11 01:00:00  8.301\n2017-10-11 02:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-11 03:00:00  8.459\n2017-10-11 04:00:00  7.650\n2017-10-11 05:00:00  7.633\n2017-10-11 06:00:00  7.862\n2017-10-11 07:00:00  8.565\n2017-10-11 08:00:00  8.248\n2017-10-11 09:00:00  8.600\n2017-10-11 10:00:00  8.829\n2017-10-11 11:00:00  9.339\n2017-10-11 12:00:00  9.620\n2017-10-11 13:00:00  9.972\n2017-10-11 14:00:00  10.060\n2017-10-11 15:00:00  10.411\n2017-10-11 16:00:00  10.306\n2017-10-11 17:00:00  10.535\n2017-10-11 18:00:00  10.341\n2017-10-11 19:00:00  10.148\n2017-10-11 20:00:00  10.042\n2017-10-11 21:00:00  9.814\n2017-10-11 22:00:00  9.743\n2017-10-11 23:00:00  9.726\n```\n\n</answer>\n",
