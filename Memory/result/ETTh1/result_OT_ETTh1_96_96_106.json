        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values. However, for forecasting, we'll assume we have to produce 96 points without any gaps.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the relatively short history (4 days), we can consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not visible.\n    - The data shows a drop on 2017-09-01 00:00:00 to 6.050, which might be an anomaly or the start of a new pattern.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can try to capture the daily seasonality.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model or a more sophisticated one. However, without additional context and due to the small data, we might use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day? But note the drop on the last day is different.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But the last day (2017-09-01) is different.\n\n 5. However, looking at the data, the first three days (Aug 29, 30, 31) show a pattern of decreasing temperatures, but then on Aug 31 the temperature is constant at 10.060 for the entire day? That seems like an anomaly. Then on Sep 1, the temperature starts at 6.050 and then rises to 12.944 by the end of the day.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, it is challenging to build a robust model. We might consider:\n    - Using the last day (Sep 1) as the base for the next 4 days? But that day has a different pattern (starting low and rising) compared to the previous days.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality. But without a clear trend and with the anomaly on Aug 31, it is tricky.\n\n 8. Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none, we can proceed to forecast.\n\n 9. We decide to use a simple method: use the last day (Sep 1) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But note that the problem asks for 96 points (4 days). However, the last day (Sep 1) is only one day and we need 4 days. We can repeat the pattern of Sep 1 for the next 4 days? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the available days? But Aug 31 is constant and might be an anomaly. So we can exclude Aug 31? Then we have only 3 days: Aug 29, 30, and Sep 1. But Sep 1 is different from the first two.\n\n 11. We note that the data from Aug 29 and 30 show a similar pattern (with a slight downward trend) and then a constant day on Aug 31, and then a different pattern on Sep 1. It is possible that the constant day (Aug 31) is an error? But we are not told to correct history.\n\n 12. Given the problem, we are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a model that is robust to such anomalies. We can try:\n\n     Option 1: Use the median of each hour for the available days (excluding Aug 31 because it is constant and might be an anomaly). But then we have only 3 days? Actually, 2 days (Aug 29 and 30) and then Sep 1? We can use:\n        - For each hour (0 to 23), take the median of the values on Aug 29, Aug 30, and Sep 1? But note that the pattern on Sep 1 is different.\n\n     Option 2: Use the last day (Sep 1) as the pattern and then adjust by the difference between the previous days? But that is complex.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a time series model with seasonality. Since we have 96 points and we want to forecast 96, we can use a model like SARIMA. However, without the ability to run code, we have to do it manually? That is not feasible.\n\n 14. Given the constraints, we might use a simple approach: \n      - For the first 24 hours (2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-02 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-09-01 (the last day) but adjusted by the average change from the previous day? \n\n 15. However, note that the problem does not require a specific method, but we must provide 96 numbers.\n\n 16. Considering the data, the drop on Sep 1 might be the start of a new pattern. Therefore, we can assume that the next 4 days will follow the pattern of Sep 1, but repeated? \n\n     Let the last day (Sep 1) be: \n        00:00: 6.050, 01:00: 7.809, ... 23:00: 10.833\n\n     Then the next 4 days (96 hours) would be:\n        Day 1 (Sep 2): same as Sep 1: 6.050, 7.809, ... 10.833\n        Day 2 (Sep 3): same as Sep 1: 6.050, 7.809, ... 10.833\n        Day 3 (Sep 4): same as Sep 1: 6.050, 7.809, ... 10.833\n        Day 4 (Sep 5): same as Sep 1: 6.050, 7.809, ... 10.833\n\n     But this ignores any trend. However, we don't have enough data to model a trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? But the last two days are Aug 31 (constant) and Sep 1 (varying). The constant day is suspicious.\n\n 18. We note that the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we are to forecast without knowing the missing values? \n\n 19. Given the above, and the fact that we must provide 96 numbers, we decide to use the pattern of the last day (Sep 1) for the next 4 days. This is a simple seasonal naive forecast with a seasonality of 1 day, using the last day as the template.\n\n 20. Therefore, we will generate 4 copies of the 24 hours from 2017-09-01.\n\n 21. The dates for the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00) and the OT values will be the same as 2017-09-01 for each corresponding hour.\n\n 22. However, note that the last day provided (Sep 1) has 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:00. We will repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 23. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        date                 OT\n        2017-09-02 00:00:00 6.050\n        2017-09-02 01:00:00 7.809\n        ... \n        2017-09-02 23:00:00 10.833\n        2017-09-03 00:00:00 6.050\n        ... \n        2017-09-05 23:00:00 10.833\n\n 24. But note: the data on 2017-09-01 starts at 23:00:00 with 10.833, so the next day (2017-09-02) starts at 00:00:00 with 6.050. This is a big drop. However, that is what happened on the last day we have.\n\n 25. This approach is simple and uses the most recent pattern.\n\n 26. We must output the complete data for the next 96 points in the required format.\n\n 27. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-02 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-09-05 23:00:00\n\n     We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n 28. The OT values for each day will be:\n\n        [6.050, 7.809, 10.833] ... (the exact 24 values from 2017-09-01)\n\n 29. We list the 24 values from 2017-09-01:\n\n        00:00: 6.050\n        01:00: 7.809\n        02:00: 8.231\n        03:00: 7.668\n        04:00: 7.879\n        05:00: 8.160\n        06:00: 8.371\n        07:00: 8.371\n        08:00: 8.793\n        09:00: 9.567\n        10:00: 10.271\n        11:00: 10.411\n        12:00: 11.115\n        13:00: 11.256\n        14:00: 11.537\n        15:00: 12.100\n        16:00: 12.451\n        17:00: 12.592\n        18:00: 12.944\n        19:00: 12.592\n        20:00: 11.678\n        21:00: 11.537\n        22:00: 10.833\n        23:00: 10.833\n\n 30. We will repeat this sequence 4 times.\n\n 31. Now, we write the answer in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple and naive approach. In practice, one would use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints and the data, this is a reasonable baseline.\n",
