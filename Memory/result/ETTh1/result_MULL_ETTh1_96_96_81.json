        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are no explicit missing entries in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided sample does not show any. So we assume that the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows some daily patterns (e.g., higher during the day, lower at night), \n    we can consider a model that captures seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 hours.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has a negative value on 2017-05-24 (which might be due to some anomaly or data issue). We must be cautious.\n\n 5. We'll use an automated approach to select the best model parameters. But note: we are limited by the data length.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the time series to trend, seasonal, and residual.\n    - Extrapolate the trend (if any) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 7. But given the short history, we might use a naive seasonal method: \n    forecast for the next day by taking the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 8. However, the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 9. We'll use a model that can handle potential missing values in the future? But the task is to forecast without any future actuals.\n\n 10. We decide to use the Seasonal Naive method: \n     The forecast for each hour in the next day (24 hours) is the value of the same hour in the last day (2017-05-24). \n     But we have 4 days of data. We can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n\n     However, note that the data on 2017-05-24 is quite different (with negative values). So we might use the median to be robust?\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels, which can handle seasonality and trend.\n\n 12. Given the data, we see a clear daily pattern. We also note that the level of the time series is changing. \n\n 13. We'll use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with additive seasonality and additive trend? \n     But the data does not show a strong trend? It seems more like a daily cycle with some level shifts.\n\n 14. We'll use additive seasonality because the seasonal variations seem roughly constant.\n\n 15. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n     - We have 96 data points (4 days of hourly data).\n     - We set the seasonality period to 24.\n     - We fit the model and then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 16. However, note: the model might not be stable with only 4 seasons? But we have to try.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last two days? But the problem requires 96 points.\n\n 18. We decide to use the Holt-Winters method. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels.\n\n 19. But note: the data has a negative value? Holt-Winters additive model can handle negative values? \n     Yes, additive model can. Multiplicative cannot.\n\n 20. We'll fit the model with additive trend, additive seasonality, and damped trend? We can try without damping first.\n\n 21. However, we are in a constrained environment (no code execution in this response). We have to simulate the process.\n\n 22. Since we cannot run code, we have to rely on a simple method that we can compute manually? \n     But the problem expects a complete set of 96 forecasted values.\n\n 23. We decide to use a seasonal naive method with averaging over the same hour of the past 4 days.\n\n     Let H be the hour of the day (0 to 23). For each hour H in the next 96 hours (which covers 4 days: 2017-05-25 to 2017-05-28), \n     we compute the forecast as the average of the same hour H from the 4 days we have (2017-05-21, 2017-05-22, 2017-05-23, 2017-05-24).\n\n     However, note that 2017-05-24 has negative values and is an outlier? We might use the median to avoid the effect of outliers.\n\n 24. But the problem says the data has missing values? In the provided 96 points, we don't see any. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 25. We'll compute the median for each hour of the day over the 4 days.\n\n 26. Steps for the method:\n     - Group the data by hour (so 24 groups: hour 0, hour 1, ... hour 23).\n     - For each hour group, take the median of the 4 values (from the 4 days).\n     - Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the median for hour0 for the first day (2017-05-25 00:00:00), then median for hour1 for 2017-05-25 01:00:00, ... up to hour23 for 2017-05-25, and then repeat the same 24 medians for the next 3 days.\n\n 27. Why median? Because on 2017-05-24, the values are very different (negative) and we want to be robust.\n\n 28.

We'll output the data in the same format.\n\n 32. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but we are generating the forecast. We are not given any in the future. \n     We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points. So we output 96 lines.\n\n 33.

But note: the medians we computed are for the same hour. So we just repeat the same 24 numbers for 4 days.\n\n 36. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 37. However, we must note that the last given date is 2017-05-24 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-05-25 00:00:00.\n\n 38. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 39. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 40. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\n\n 41. We'll write the data as:\n\n        date                 MULL\n        2017-05-25 00:00:00 0.231\n        ... \n\n 42. However, the example input did not have a header? But the problem says \"give me the complete data\", and the input had a header? \n     Actually, the input was given as:\n\n               date   MULL\n        2017-05-21 00:00:00  0.213\n\n     So we output without the header? The problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning just the rows? \n     Since the input was provided without the header in the data rows, we output without the header.\n\n 43. We output 96 rows of data.\n\n 44. Let's generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-05-25 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-05-25 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-25 23:00:00 (24 rows)\n     Then 2017-05-26 00:00:00 to 2017-05-26 23:00:00 (next 24)\n     Then 2017-05-27 00:00:00 to 2017-05-27 23:00:00 (next 24)\n     Then 2017-05-28 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00 (last 24)\n\n 45. We have the medians for hour0 to hour23. We'll use:\n\n        hour0: 0.231\n        hour1: 0.124\n        hour2: 0.320\n        hour3: 0.142\n        hour4: 0.320\n        hour5: 0.604\n        hour6: 1.279\n        hour7: 0.942\n        hour8: 0.693\n        hour9: 0.800\n        hour10: 0.853\n        hour11: 0.870\n        hour12: 1.049\n        hour13: 1.616\n        hour14: 0.728\n        hour15: 0.818\n        hour16: 0.551\n        hour17: 0.657\n        hour18: 0.444\n        hour19: 0.409\n        hour20: 0.160\n        hour21: 0.089\n        hour22: 0.124\n        hour23: 0.320\n\n 46. We'll write the values rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. Now, we write the answer.\n\n 48. Note: We are using a very simple method because we cannot run complex models here. In practice, one might use a more sophisticated model.\n\n 49. But the problem says we are an expert, and we are to provide the forecast. This method is robust and simple.\n\n 50. We output the 96 rows.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
