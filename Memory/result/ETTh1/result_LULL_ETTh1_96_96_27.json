        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00) for the variable \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can observe that the load varies throughout the day.\n 2. There are missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. But we are told that the dataset may have missing values. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have none.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that captures seasonality. Given the small data size (only 4 days of history) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, \n    we can use a simple seasonal model or a naive approach. However, note that the data shows a pattern that repeats daily but with some variation.\n\n 5. Considering the data, we see:\n    - On 2016-10-17: positive values during the day and negative on the next days? Actually, the first day (2016-10-17) is positive and then becomes negative.\n    - This might be due to a change in the context? But we are only given 4 days. \n\n 6. Since we are only 4 days of data, it is challenging to build a complex model. We can try to capture the daily seasonality by averaging the same hour across the available days.\n\n    However, note the first day (2016-10-17) is entirely positive and the next three days are negative. This might indicate a structural break? \n    But without more context, we have to use the available data.\n\n 7. Approach:\n    We will use the last three days (2016-10-18 to 2016-10-20) to compute the daily pattern because they are more consistent (all negative) and the first day is an outlier? \n    Alternatively, we can use all four days and average, but the first day is very different.\n\n    Let's check the pattern:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-10-17): \n        Starts at 0.579, then goes down to 0.518, up to 0.609, then down to 0.518 at 5:00, then increases to 0.792 at 9:00, then decreases again.\n\n    Days 2,3,4: \n        They are negative and show a pattern: \n        - The values are more negative during the night and less negative during the day? Actually, looking at 2016-10-18:\n          - It starts at -0.457, then becomes more negative until around 12:00 (-1.036), then becomes a bit less negative in the afternoon, then more negative at night.\n\n    Since the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days, we must rely on these 4 days.\n\n 8. Given the abrupt change from positive to negative, it might be that the first day is an anomaly? Or the data is normalized? \n\n    Without more context, we decide to use the last three days (72 points) to forecast the next 96 points? But we are to forecast 96 points (4 days). \n\n    We can compute the average daily profile for the last three days and then use that for the next four days? But we only have three days to average.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the dataset is subdivided and we are given the \"Low UseLess Load\" data. The name suggests it might be a residual or a specific component.\n\n 9. We can try a naive seasonal forecast: using the last day (2016-10-20) as the forecast for the next day? But we need 4 days.\n\n    Alternatively, we can take the average of the last three days for each hour of the day) and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n      - We have 24 hours in a day. We will group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) for the last three days (2016-10-18, 2016-10-19, 2016-10-20).\n      - For each hour, compute the mean of the three values.\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this averaged daily pattern 4 times.\n\n 10. Why not use the first day? Because the first day is positive and the rest are negative. It seems inconsistent. We assume the recent pattern (last three days) will continue.\n\n 11. But note: the last three days are consecutive and show a similar pattern? Let's check:\n\n      Hour 00:00: \n        2016-10-18: -0.457\n        2016-10-19: -0.975\n        2016-10-20: -0.701   -> average = (-0.457 -0.975 -0.701)/3 = -0.711\n\n      Hour 01:00:\n        2016-10-18: -0.457\n        2016-10-19: -1.036\n        2016-10-20: -1.005   -> average = (-0.457 -1.036 -1.005)/3 = -0.8327\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 12. We will compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n 13. However, note that the data might have a trend? The last three days show a slight trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n      Day 2 (2016-10-18): average of the day = mean of 24 values: \n          We can compute: \n            -0.457, -0.457, -0.518, -0.518, -0.487, -0.487, -0.396, -0.426, -0.335, -0.761, -0.761, -0.914, -1.036, -0.914, -0.822, -0.914, -0.883, -0.822, -0.975, -1.005, -1.066, -1.066, -1.097, -1.097\n          Average = -0.772\n\n      Day 3 (2016-10-19): \n          -0.975, -1.036, -1.066, -1.036, -1.005, -1.097, -1.127, -1.005, -0.822, -0.731, -0.853, -1.005, -1.036, -1.005, -1.036, -1.005, -1.036, -1.005, -1.036, -1.097, -1.005, -1.066, -0.761, -0.944\n          Average = -0.978\n\n      Day 4 (2016-10-20):\n          -0.701, -1.005, -1.005, -1.005, -1.005, -1.036, -1.036, -0.975, -0.883, -0.792, -0.822, -0.914, -1.066, -1.036, -0.975, -0.975, -1.005, -0.914, -1.005, -1.097, -1.097, -1.097, -1.097, -1.036\n          Average = -0.968\n\n      The average is around -0.77, -0.98, -0.97. There is a drop from day2 to day3 and then stable? \n\n      We might consider a slight downward trend? But with only three points, it's hard. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three days without trend.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the small data, we decide to use the hourly averages of the last three days and then project that for the next four days.\n\n 15. Steps:\n\n      a) Extract the 24 hours for each of the last three days (2016-10-18, 2016-10-19, 2016-10-20).\n      b) For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of the three days.\n      c) Create the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 16. The dates for the next 96 hours start from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n 17. We must be cautious: the provided data ends at 2016-10-20 23:00:00. The next hour is 2016-10-21 00:00:00.\n\n 18. Let's calculate the hourly averages:\n\n      Hour 0: ( -0.457 + -0.975 + -0.701 ) / 3 = (-2.133) / 3 = -0.711\n      Hour 1: ( -0.457 + -1.036 + -1.005 ) / 3 = (-2.498) / 3 = -0.8327\n      Hour 2: ( -0.518 + -1.066 + -1.005 ) / 3 = (-2.589) / 3 = -0.863\n      Hour 3: ( -0.518 + -1.036 + -1.005 ) / 3 = (-2.559) / 3 = -0.853\n      Hour 4: ( -0.487 + -1.005 + -1.005 ) / 3 = (-2.497) / 3 = -0.8323\n      Hour 5: ( -0.487 + -1.097 + -1.036 ) / 3 = (-2.62) / 3 = -0.8733\n      Hour 6: ( -0.396 + -1.127 + -1.036 ) / 3 = (-2.559) / 3 = -0.853\n      Hour 7: ( -0.426 + -1.005 + -0.975 ) / 3 = (-2.406) / 3 = -0.802\n      Hour 8: ( -0.335 + -0.822 + -0.883 ) / 3 = (-2.04) / 3 = -0.68\n      Hour 9: ( -0.761 + -0.731 + -0.792 ) / 3 = (-2.284) / 3 = -0.7613\n      Hour 10: ( -0.761 + -0.853 + -0.822 ) / 3 = (-2.436) / 3 = -0.812\n      Hour 11: ( -0.914 + -1.005 + -0.914 ) / 3 = (-2.833) / 3 = -0.9443\n      Hour 12: ( -1.036 + -1.036 + -1.066 ) / 3 = (-3.138) / 3 = -1.046\n      Hour 13: ( -0.914 + -1.005 + -1.036 ) / 3 = (-2.955) / 3 = -0.985\n      Hour 14: ( -0.822 + -1.036 + -0.975 ) / 3 = (-2.833) / 3 = -0.9443\n      Hour 15: ( -0.914 + -1.005 + -0.975 ) / 3 = (-2.894) / 3 = -0.9647\n      Hour 16: ( -0.883 + -1.036 + -1.005 ) / 3 = (-2.924) / 3 = -0.9747\n      Hour 17: ( -0.822 + -1.005 + -0.914 ) / 3 = (-2.741) / 3 = -0.9137\n      Hour 18: ( -0.975 + -1.036 + -1.005 ) / 3 = (-3.016) / 3 = -1.0053\n      Hour 19: ( -1.005 + -1.097 + -1.097 ) / 3 = (-3.199) / 3 = -1.0663\n      Hour 20: ( -1.066 + -1.005 + -1.097 ) / 3 = (-3.168) / 3 = -1.056\n      Hour 21: ( -1.066 + -1.066 + -1.097 ) / 3 = (-3.229) / 3 = -1.0763\n      Hour 22: ( -1.097 + -0.761 + -1.097 ) / 3 = (-2.955) / 3 = -0.985\n      Hour 23: ( -1.097 + -0.944 + -1.036 ) / 3 = (-3.077) / 3 = -1.0257\n\n 19. Now, we will create 4 days of data by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 20. The dates: \n      Day 1: 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-21 23:00:00\n      Day 2: 2016-10-22 00:00:00 to 2016-10-22 23:00:00\n      Day 3: 2016-10-23 00:00:00 to 2016-10-23 23:00:00\n      Day 4: 2016-10-24 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00\n\n 21. We write the data in the same format: two columns (date and LULL). The LULL values are the averages we computed, repeated 4 times.\n\n 22. We must round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimals.\n\n 23. Let's create the data:\n\n      Hour 0: -0.711 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.711\n      Hour 1: -0.833 (since -0.8327 rounded to 3 decimals is -0.833)\n      ... and so on.\n\n 24. We recalculate the averages and round to 3 decimals:\n\n      Hour 0: (-0.457 -0.975 -0.701) = -2.133 / 3 = -0.711 -> -0.711\n      Hour 1: (-0.457 -1.036 -1.005) = -2.498 / 3 = -0.832666... -> -0.833\n      Hour 2: (-0.518 -1.066 -1.005) = -2.589 / 3 = -0.863 -> -0.863\n      Hour 3: (-0.518 -1.036 -1.005) = -2.559 / 3 = -0.853 -> -0.853\n      Hour 4: (-0.487 -1.005 -1.005) = -2.497 / 3 = -0.832333... -> -0.832\n      Hour 5: (-0.487 -1.097 -1.036) = -2.62 / 3 = -0.873333... -> -0.873\n      Hour 6: (-0.396 -1.127 -1.036) = -2.559 / 3 = -0.853 -> -0.853\n      Hour 7: (-0.426 -1.005 -0.975) = -2.406 / 3 = -0.802 -> -0.802\n      Hour 8: (-0.335 -0.822 -0.883) = -2.04 / 3 = -0.68 -> -0.680\n      Hour 9: (-0.761 -0.731 -0.792) = -2.284 / 3 = -0.761333... -> -0.761\n      Hour 10: (-0.761 -0.853 -0.822) = -2.436 / 3 = -0.812 -> -0.812\n      Hour 11: (-0.914 -1.005 -0.914) = -2.833 / 3 = -0.944333... -> -0.944\n      Hour 12: (-1.036 -1.036 -1.066) = -3.138 / 3 = -1.046 -> -1.046\n      Hour 13: (-0.914 -1.005 -1.036) = -2.955 / 3 = -0.985 -> -0.985\n      Hour 14: (-0.822 -1.036 -0.975) = -2.833 / 3 = -0.944333... -> -0.944\n      Hour 15: (-0.914 -1.005 -0.975) = -2.894 / 3 = -0.964666... -> -0.965\n      Hour 16: (-0.883 -1.036 -1.005) = -2.924 / 3 = -0.974666... -> -0.975\n      Hour 17: (-0.822 -1.005 -0.914) = -2.741 / 3 = -0.913666... -> -0.914\n      Hour 18: (-0.975 -1.036 -1.005) = -3.016 / 3 = -1.005333... -> -1.005\n      Hour 19: (-1.005 -1.097 -1.097) = -3.199 / 3 = -1.066333... -> -1.066\n      Hour 20: (-1.066 -1.005 -1.097) = -3.168 / 3 = -1.056 -> -1.056\n      Hour 21: (-1.066 -1.066 -1.097) = -3.229 / 3 = -1.076333... -> -1.076\n      Hour 22: (-1.097 -0.761 -1.097) = -2.955 / 3 = -0.985 -> -0.985\n      Hour 23: (-1.097 -0.944 -1.036) = -3.077 / 3 = -1.025666... -> -1.026\n\n 25. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1 (2016-10-21):\n          00:00:00: -0.711\n          01:00:00: -0.833\n          02:00:00: -0.863\n          03:00:00: -0.853\n          04:00:00: -0.832\n          05:00:00: -0.873\n          06:00:00: -0.853\n          07:00:00: -0.802\n          08:00:00: -0.680\n          09:00:00: -0.761\n          10:00:00: -0.812\n          11:00:00: -0.944\n          12:00:00: -1.046\n          13:00:00: -0.985\n          14:00:00: -0.944\n          15:00:00: -0.965\n          16:00:00: -0.975\n          17:00:00: -0.914\n          18:00:00: -1.005\n          19:00:00: -1.066\n          20:00:00: -1.056\n          21:00:00: -1.076\n          22:00:00: -0.985\n          23:00:00: -1.026\n\n      Then repeat the same pattern for the next three days.\n\n 26. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-21 00:00:00\n      Then 2016-10-21 01:00:00 ... until 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We write the data in the same format as the input.\n\n 28. Note: The input data had 96 points (4 days) and we are forecasting the next 96 points (4 days).\n\n 29. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 30. We note that this is a simple approach. In a real scenario, we might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even LSTM) but given the data size (only 4 days) and the requirement, we use this averaging method.\n\n 31. We are aware that the first day (2016-10-17) was positive and we ignored it. But the last three days are negative and we assume the pattern continues.\n\n 32. We output the data.\n",
