        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MULL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, the provided sample does not show any missing values. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the data shows some patterns (daily seasonality, as we see similar patterns each day) and potential non-stationarity, we can consider models like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the last day (2016-12-31) has constant value 0.107 for all 24 hours. This is unusual and might be an anomaly or due to a holiday? But we have to forecast beyond that.\n\n 5. We must be cautious: the problem says there are missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So for the forecasting, we assume the model we build can handle missing values, but since we are only given complete data for the history, we can proceed.\n\n 6. We choose a model:\n    - Let's try to fit a SARIMA model. The data has a clear daily seasonality (period=24).\n    - We can also consider that the data might have a weekly pattern, but we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we stick to daily (24 hours).\n\n 7. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We need to determine the orders: (p, d, q) for non-seasonal part and (P, D, Q, s) for seasonal part (s=24).\n    - We can use auto_arima from pmdarima to help with parameter selection? But we are not allowed to run code, so we have to reason.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model if we are to do it manually. However, the problem requires a forecast for 96 points.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are in a simulated environment, we will generate a forecast using a naive method? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 10. But note: the problem says we are an expert. We must provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n 11. Observing the data:\n     - The first three days (2016-12-28, 2016-12-29, 2016-12-30) show a pattern: \n        * During the night (00:00 to 06:00) the values are relatively higher (positive and less negative) and then during the day they become more negative, especially in the afternoon and evening.\n     - The fourth day (2016-12-31) is constant. This might be New Year's Eve? So the next day (2017-01-01) might also be a holiday? But we are forecasting from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n 12. Since we don't have data beyond 2016-12-31, and the last day is constant, we might assume that the next day (New Year's Day) could also be a holiday and have a similar pattern? But the constant value is 0.107, which is not seen in the previous days.\n\n 13. However, without more context, we have to rely on the available data.\n\n 14. Approach:\n     - We can use the average of the first three days for each hour of the day to forecast the next three days? But then the fourth day in the forecast (which is the 4th day beyond 2016-12-31) would be the same as the first day of the pattern? But note we are forecasting 96 hours (4 days).\n\n     - However, the last day of history (2016-12-31) is constant. We don't know if the next day (2017-01-01) will be constant or not.\n\n 15. Considering the requirement for completeness and the fact that we must provide 96 points, we decide:\n\n     Option 1: Use the last day (2016-12-31) pattern for the next day? But that day is constant. Then for the following three days, use the average of the first three days? But that would be inconsistent.\n\n     Option 2: Ignore the last day as an anomaly and use the first three days to compute an hourly profile. Then use that profile for the next 4 days? But note: the next 4 days start from 2017-01-01, which is a holiday? So maybe the first day of the forecast (2017-01-01) should be constant? But we don't have enough data to confirm.\n\n 16. Given the ambiguity, we decide to use a simple average of the first three days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days? But that would repeat the same pattern 4 times. However, the last day of history (2016-12-31) breaks the pattern. We are not sure if the next day is a holiday or not.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the average of all four days? But the last day is constant and would dominate the average? That might not be representative.\n\n 18. We decide to treat the last day (2016-12-31) as an outlier and use only the first three days to compute the hourly pattern.\n\n     Steps:\n        - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour from the first three days (2016-12-28, 2016-12-29, 2016-12-30).\n        - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days: 2017-01-01 to 2017-01-04), we repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n 19. But note: the first three days are:\n        Day1: 2016-12-28 (Wednesday)\n        Day2: 2016-12-29 (Thursday)\n        Day3: 2016-12-30 (Friday)\n        Then the next day is 2016-12-31 (Saturday) -> constant, then we are forecasting:\n        2017-01-01 (Sunday), 2017-01-02 (Monday), 2017-01-03 (Tuesday), 2017-01-04 (Wednesday)\n\n     We don't have data for Saturday and Sunday in the training (except the constant Saturday). So we might adjust:\n\n        - For Saturday and Sunday, we might use the constant pattern? But we don't have a Sunday pattern.\n\n 20. Given the complexity and the lack of data, we decide to use the three-day average for the next four days. This is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 21. Compute the hourly average for the first three days:\n\n        hour0: (0.604 + 0.320 + 0.711) / 3 = (0.604+0.320+0.711)=1.635/3=0.545\n        hour1: (0.604 + 0.071 + 0.924) / 3 = (0.604+0.071+0.924)=1.599/3=0.533\n        hour2: (0.036 + 0.604 + 0.284) / 3 = (0.036+0.604+0.284)=0.924/3=0.308\n        hour3: (0.213 + 0.569 + 0.178) / 3 = (0.213+0.569+0.178)=0.96/3=0.320\n        hour4: (0.036 + 0.142 -0.853) / 3 = (0.036+0.142-0.853)= -0.675/3 = -0.225\n        hour5: (-0.462 + 0.604 -0.746) / 3 = (-0.462+0.604-0.746)= -0.604/3 = -0.2013\n        hour6: (-0.604 + 0.426 -0.569) / 3 = (-0.604+0.426-0.569)= -0.747/3 = -0.249\n        hour7: (-0.569 -1.599 -1.173) / 3 = (-0.569-1.599-1.173)= -3.341/3 = -1.1137\n        hour8: (-0.107 -0.924 -0.391) / 3 = (-0.107-0.924-0.391)= -1.422/3 = -0.474\n        hour9: (-0.817 -1.102 -1.279) / 3 = (-0.817-1.102-1.279)= -3.198/3 = -1.066\n        hour10: (-0.782 -0.995 -1.883) / 3 = (-0.782-0.995-1.883)= -3.66/3 = -1.22\n        hour11: (-0.675 +0.995 -1.777) / 3 = (-0.675+0.995-1.777)= -1.457/3 = -0.4857\n        hour12: (-2.523 +0.497 -2.416) / 3 = (-2.523+0.497-2.416)= -4.442/3 = -1.4807\n        hour13: (-1.031 -1.883 -1.457) / 3 = (-1.031-1.883-1.457)= -4.371/3 = -1.457\n        hour14: (-0.462 -1.137 -1.670) / 3 = (-0.462-1.137-1.670)= -3.269/3 = -1.0897\n        hour15: (-1.635 -0.959 -2.061) / 3 = (-1.635-0.959-2.061)= -4.655/3 = -1.5517\n        hour16: (-1.102 -1.102 -1.386) / 3 = (-1.102-1.102-1.386)= -3.59/3 = -1.1967\n        hour17: (-1.279 -1.706 -1.777) / 3 = (-1.279-1.706-1.777)= -4.762/3 = -1.5873\n        hour18: (-1.741 -1.990 -1.670) / 3 = (-1.741-1.990-1.670)= -5.401/3 = -1.8003\n        hour19: (-1.350 -1.883 -1.848) / 3 = (-1.350-1.883-1.848)= -5.081/3 = -1.6937\n        hour20: (-1.670 -1.777 -2.061) / 3 = (-1.670-1.777-2.061)= -5.508/3 = -1.836\n        hour21: (-1.741 -1.919 -2.345) / 3 = (-1.741-1.919-2.345)= -6.005/3 = -2.0017\n        hour22: (0.249 +0.000 -1.350) / 3 = (0.249+0.000-1.350)= -1.101/3 = -0.367\n        hour23: (-0.036 -0.355 -0.746) / 3 = (-0.036-0.355-0.746)= -1.137/3 = -0.379\n\n 22. Then, for the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00), we assign:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-01): [0.545, 0.533, 0.308, 0.320, -0.225, -0.2013, -0.249, -1.1137, -0.474, -1.066, -1.22, -0.4857, -1.4807, -1.457, -1.0897, -1.5517, -1.1967, -1.5873, -1.8003, -1.6937, -1.836, -2.0017, -0.367, -0.379]\n        Day2 (2017-01-02): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-01-03): same as above\n        Day4 (2017-01-04): same as above\n\n 23. But note: the last day of history (2016-12-31) was a constant. We are forecasting 2017-01-01 (Sunday) and beyond. We don't have evidence that Sunday should follow the same pattern as Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. However, without more data, this is the best we can do.\n\n 24. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 25. Format the output: We must provide the next 96 dates starting from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00, with the forecasted MULL.\n\n 26. Generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-31 23:00:00 is the last given. Then next is:\n        2017-01-01 00:00:00, 2017-01-01 01:00:00, ... until 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We write the data in the next 96 rows.\n\n 28. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 rows without missing values.\n\n 29. We use the computed averages for each hour and repeat for 4 days.\n\n 30. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        date                 MULL\n        2017-01-01 00:00:00 0.545\n        2017-01-01 01:00:00 0.533\n        2017-01-01 02:00:00 0.308\n        2017-01-01 03:00:00 0.320\n        2017-01-01 04:00:00 -0.225\n        2017-01-01 05:00:00 -0.201\n        2017-01-01 06:00:00 -0.249\n        2017-01-01 07:00:00 -1.114\n        2017-01-01 08:00:00 -0.474\n        2017-01-01 09:00:00 -1.066\n        2017-01-01 10:00:00 -1.220\n        2017-01-01 11:00:00 -0.486\n        2017-01-01 12:00:00 -1.481\n        2017-01-01 13:00:00 -1.457\n        2017-01-01 14:00:00 -1.090\n        2017-01-01 15:00:00 -1.552\n        2017-01-01 16:00:00 -1.197\n        2017-01-01 17:00:00 -1.587\n        2017-01-01 18:00:00 -1.800\n        2017-01-01 19:00:00 -1.694\n        2017-01-01 20:00:00 -1.836\n        2017-01-01 21:00:00 -2.002\n        2017-01-01 22:00:00 -0.367\n        2017-01-01 23:00:00 -0.379\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 31. We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 32. However, note: the input has values like -2.523, so we keep 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. We output the entire 96 points.\n\n 34. But note: the last day of history is 2016-12-31 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-01-01 00:00:00.\n\n 35. We generate the next 96 dates by adding 1 hour each time.\n\n 36. We write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n 37. However, note: the problem says the data is sampled hourly, so we generate hourly.\n\n 38. We must be cautious: the last day of the provided data is 2016-12-31 23:00:00, so the next 96 dates are:\n\n        2017-01-01 00:00:00\n        2017-01-01 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-01-04 23:00:00\n\n 39. We output the data accordingly.\n\n 40. Since we are repeating the same 24 values 4 times, we can generate the list and then output.\n\n 41. Let's list the 24 hourly averages (rounded to 3 decimals) for one day:\n\n        hour0: 0.545\n        hour1: 0.533\n        hour2: 0.308\n        hour3: 0.320\n        hour4: -0.225\n        hour5: -0.201\n        hour6: -0.249\n        hour7: -1.114\n        hour8: -0.474\n        hour9: -1.066\n        hour10: -1.220\n        hour11: -0.486\n        hour12: -1.481\n        hour13: -1.457\n        hour14: -1.090\n        hour15: -1.552\n        hour16: -1.197\n        hour17: -1.587\n        hour18: -1.800\n        hour19: -1.694\n        hour20: -1.836\n        hour21: -2.002\n        hour22: -0.367\n        hour23: -0.379\n\n 42. We use these 24 numbers for each of the 4 days.\n\n 43. Write the answer in the required XML block.\n\n 44. Note: The problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we must write all 96 lines.\n\n 45. We generate the data accordingly.\n\n 46. However, note: the last day of the provided data is 2016-12-31 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours are:\n\n        2017-01-01 00:00:00\n        2017-01-01 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-01-04 23:00:00\n\n 47. We write the data.\n\n 48. We note that the rounding: we did the averages and then rounded to 3 decimals. We used:\n\n        hour0: (0.604+0.320+0.711)=1.635 -> 1.635/3 = 0.545 (exactly 0.545)\n        hour1: (0.604+0.071+0.924)=1.599 -> 1.599/3 = 0.533 (exactly 0.533)\n        ... etc.\n\n 49. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n               date   MULL\n        2017-01-01 00:00:00  0.545\n        2017-01-01 01:00:00  0.533\n        ... \n        2017-01-04 23:00:00  -0.379\n        </answer>\n\n 50. But note: the example input had the date as index and then a column MULL. We output similarly.\n\n 51. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 52. We do it.\n\n 53. However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records ... between July 2016 and July 2018\", but we are only given 4 days. We are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 54. We proceed.\n\n 55. Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n 56. We write the 96 lines.\n\n 57. We note: the dates must be in the correct string format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 58. We generate:\n\n        for day in [1,2,3,4] of January 2017:\n            for hour in 0 to 23:\n                date_str = f\"2017-01-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n 59. But note: day1: 01, day2: 02, day3: 03, day4:04.\n\n 60. We output.\n\n 61. We are done.\n\n 62. However, note: the last day of the provided data is 2016-12-31, so the next day is 2017-01-01.\n\n 63.
