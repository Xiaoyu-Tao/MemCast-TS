        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and some missing values? But the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points.\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is time series with potential seasonality (daily cycles, as we see patterns repeating every 24 hours) and possible non-stationarity, we can use a model that captures these.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA or a machine learning model. However, without more data (like multiple years) we are limited to daily seasonality.\n - Given the small data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can try to capture the daily pattern and extend it, but also account for any trend.\n\n However, note: the data provided is only 4 days. We see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day, but there is a rough daily cycle.\n\n Since we are limited by the data, we can try:\n   - Decompose the series into trend and seasonal components and then forecast each.\n   - Use a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with daily seasonality (but note: daily seasonality with 24 for hourly data would require a SARIMA(..., seasonal_order=(P,D,Q,24)) which is too many parameters for 96 points).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: \n   - Use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can use the available 96 points.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use a simple method: \n   - We will compute the average pattern for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the available 4 days, and then adjust by a trend if any.\n\n However, we see that the values are not exactly repeating. We can also use a moving average to smooth and then project.\n\n But note: the last day (2017-08-08) shows a drop in the values. So we might need to account for a downward trend? \n\n Let's check the overall trend: \n   - The first day (2017-08-05) has values mostly above 1.0, the next two days are also around 1.0-1.5, but the last day (2017-08-08) has some values (like 0.67) that are lower.\n\n However, without more context, we can try to model the daily pattern and the trend separately.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n 1. Extract the hour of the day and the day of the time series.\n 2. Compute the average for each hour (across the 4 days) to get a base pattern.\n 3. But we also see a possible downward trend? Let's compute the daily average:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-08-05): average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n    Day 2: average\n    Day 3: average\n    Day 4: average\n\n 4. Then we can fit a linear regression to the daily averages to get a trend. Then adjust the base pattern by the trend for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note: we are forecasting hourly, so we need to break down.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that combines:\n   - A daily seasonal component (with 24 periods) and a linear trend.\n\n We can model:\n   y(t) = trend(t) + seasonal(t) + error\n\n For the next 96 hours (4 days), we can:\n   - Extend the trend linearly (if we see a clear trend) and add the seasonal component.\n\n How to compute:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the daily average for the 4 days we have.\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-05: average = (1.097+1.218+...+1.157)/24 -> let's compute quickly:\n\n        We can approximate: \n          The numbers are between 0.975 and 1.98, but let me compute:\n\n          I'll do a quick sum: \n            Day1: \n              00: 1.097, 01:1.218, 02:1.249, 03:1.157, 04:1.279, 05:1.340, 06:1.492, 07:1.462, 08:1.462, 09:1.340, 10:0.975, 11:1.005, \n              12:1.340, 13:1.401, 14:0.975, 15:1.249, 16:1.310, 17:1.401, 18:1.432, 19:1.614, 20:1.706, 21:1.980, 22:1.279, 23:1.157\n\n          Sum = 1.097+1.218+1.249+1.157+1.279+1.340+1.492+1.462+1.462+1.340+0.975+1.005+1.340+1.401+0.975+1.249+1.310+1.401+1.432+1.614+1.706+1.980+1.279+1.157\n          Let me add step by step:\n\n          1.097+1.218=2.315\n          +1.249=3.564\n          +1.157=4.721\n          +1.279=6.000\n          +1.340=7.340\n          +1.492=8.832\n          +1.462=10.294\n          +1.462=11.756\n          +1.340=13.096\n          +0.975=14.071\n          +1.005=15.076\n          +1.340=16.416\n          +1.401=17.817\n          +0.975=18.792\n          +1.249=20.041\n          +1.310=21.351\n          +1.401=22.752\n          +1.432=24.184\n          +1.614=25.798\n          +1.706=27.504\n          +1.980=29.484\n          +1.279=30.763\n          +1.157=31.92\n\n          Average Day1 = 31.92 / 24 = 1.33\n\n        Day2: 2017-08-06\n          00:1.066, 01:1.279, 02:1.097, 03:1.188, 04:1.097, 05:1.097, 06:1.310, 07:1.371, 08:1.310, 09:1.310, 10:1.401, 11:1.432, \n          12:1.249, 13:1.401, 14:1.340, 15:1.401, 16:1.432, 17:1.279, 18:1.492, 19:1.340, 20:1.401, 21:1.462, 22:1.279, 23:1.279\n\n          Sum = 1.066+1.279+1.097+1.188+1.097+1.097+1.310+1.371+1.310+1.310+1.401+1.432+1.249+1.401+1.340+1.401+1.432+1.279+1.492+1.340+1.401+1.462+1.279+1.279\n\n          Let me add:\n\n          1.066+1.279=2.345\n          +1.097=3.442\n          +1.188=4.63\n          +1.097=5.727\n          +1.097=6.824\n          +1.310=8.134\n          +1.371=9.505\n          +1.310=10.815\n          +1.310=12.125\n          +1.401=13.526\n          +1.432=14.958\n          +1.249=16.207\n          +1.401=17.608\n          +1.340=18.948\n          +1.401=20.349\n          +1.432=21.781\n          +1.279=23.06\n          +1.492=24.552\n          +1.340=25.892\n          +1.401=27.293\n          +1.462=28.755\n          +1.279=30.034\n          +1.279=31.313\n\n          Average Day2 = 31.313 / 24 = 1.3047\n\n        Day3: 2017-08-07\n          00:1.553, 01:1.432, 02:1.523, 03:1.462, 04:1.249, 05:1.553, 06:1.675, 07:1.523, 08:1.523, 09:1.706, 10:1.584, 11:1.645,\n          12:1.492, 13:1.462, 14:1.492, 15:1.492, 16:1.553, 17:1.005, 18:1.157, 19:1.310, 20:1.858, 21:1.645, 22:1.858, 23:1.492\n\n          Sum = 1.553+1.432+1.523+1.462+1.249+1.553+1.675+1.523+1.523+1.706+1.584+1.645+1.492+1.462+1.492+1.492+1.553+1.005+1.157+1.310+1.858+1.645+1.858+1.492\n\n          Let me add:\n\n          1.553+1.432=2.985\n          +1.523=4.508\n          +1.462=5.97\n          +1.249=7.219\n          +1.553=8.772\n          +1.675=10.447\n          +1.523=11.97\n          +1.523=13.493\n          +1.706=15.199\n          +1.584=16.783\n          +1.645=18.428\n          +1.492=19.92\n          +1.462=21.382\n          +1.492=22.874\n          +1.492=24.366\n          +1.553=25.919\n          +1.005=26.924\n          +1.157=28.081\n          +1.310=29.391\n          +1.858=31.249\n          +1.645=32.894\n          +1.858=34.752\n          +1.492=36.244\n\n          Average Day3 = 36.244 / 24 = 1.5102\n\n        Day4: 2017-08-08\n          00:1.157, 01:1.097, 02:1.066, 03:0.883, 04:0.853, 05:0.670, 06:0.883, 07:0.883, 08:1.218, 09:1.249, 10:1.188, 11:1.127,\n          12:1.492, 13:1.218, 14:1.127, 15:1.249, 16:1.401, 17:1.401, 18:1.279, 19:1.249, 20:1.157, 21:0.914, 22:1.036, 23:0.914\n\n          Sum = 1.157+1.097+1.066+0.883+0.853+0.670+0.883+0.883+1.218+1.249+1.188+1.127+1.492+1.218+1.127+1.249+1.401+1.401+1.279+1.249+1.157+0.914+1.036+0.914\n\n          Let me add:\n\n          1.157+1.097=2.254\n          +1.066=3.32\n          +0.883=4.203\n          +0.853=5.056\n          +0.670=5.726\n          +0.883=6.609\n          +0.883=7.492\n          +1.218=8.71\n          +1.249=9.959\n          +1.188=11.147\n          +1.127=12.274\n          +1.492=13.766\n          +1.218=14.984\n          +1.127=16.111\n          +1.249=17.36\n          +1.401=18.761\n          +1.401=20.162\n          +1.279=21.441\n          +1.249=22.69\n          +1.157=23.847\n          +0.914=24.761\n          +1.036=25.797\n          +0.914=26.711\n\n          Average Day4 = 26.711 / 24 = 1.1130\n\n        So the daily averages: \n          Day1: 1.33\n          Day2: 1.3047\n          Day3: 1.5102\n          Day4: 1.1130\n\n        There is no clear linear trend? It goes up then down. So we might just take the average of these 4 days as the base level for the next days? \n        But the last day is lower. Maybe we are seeing a drop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? Or we can take a moving average? \n\n        Since we don't have a clear trend, we can only assume that the next 4 days will have a daily average as the average of the past 4 days? \n\n        Average of daily averages = (1.33 + 1.3047 + 1.5102 + 1.1130) / 4 = (5.2579)/4 = 1.3145\n\n        But note: the last day is 1.1130, which is below the average. So we might be in a downward trend? \n\n        We can also compute a linear trend on the daily averages:\n\n          Day index: 1,2,3,4\n          x = [1,2,3,4], y = [1.33, 1.3047, 1.5102, 1.1130]\n\n          We can fit a linear regression: y = a + b*x\n\n          But with 4 points, and the last point is low, the slope might be negative? \n\n          Let me compute:\n\n          n = 4\n          sum_x = 10, sum_y = 5.2579, sum_xy = 1*1.33 + 2*1.3047 + 3*1.5102 + 4*1.1130 = 1.33 + 2.6094 + 4.5306 + 4.452 = 12.922\n          sum_x2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n          b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n            = (4*12.922 - 10*5.2579) / (4*30 - 100)\n            = (51.688 - 52.579) / (120 - 100)\n            = (-0.891) / 20 = -0.04455\n\n          a = (sum_y - b*sum_x)/n = (5.2579 - (-0.04455)*10)/4 = (5.2579 + 0.4455)/4 = 5.7034/4 = 1.42585\n\n          So the trend line: y = 1.42585 - 0.04455*x\n\n          Then for the next 4 days (x=5,6,7,8):\n\n            Day5 (x=5): 1.42585 - 0.04455*5 = 1.42585 - 0.22275 = 1.2031\n            Day6 (x=6): 1.42585 - 0.04455*6 = 1.42585 - 0.2673 = 1.15855\n            Day7 (x=7): 1.42585 - 0.04455*7 = 1.42585 - 0.31185 = 1.114\n            Day8 (x=8): 1.42585 - 0.04455*8 = 1.42585 - 0.3564 = 1.06945\n\n        This shows a decreasing trend.\n\n 2. Now, for the seasonal component, we can compute the average for each hour of the day (0-23) over the 4 days, but then we have to adjust for the trend? \n\n    We can de-trend the data first? \n\n    Alternatively, we can compute the seasonal indices without de-trending? \n\n    Since we have a trend, we can remove the trend from each day and then compute the seasonal indices.\n\n    Steps:\n\n      For each day, we have a daily average (the trend value for that day is the daily average we computed above? or the trend line value for that day?).\n\n      Actually, we have the daily trend_line values for the past days:\n\n        Day1 (x=1): trend_value = 1.42585 - 0.04455*1 = 1.3813\n        Day2 (x=2): 1.42585 - 0.04455*2 = 1.33675\n        Day3 (x=3): 1.42585 - 0.04455*3 = 1.2922\n        Day4 (x=4): 1.42585 - 0.04455*4 = 1.24765\n\n      But note: we have the daily averages: [1.33, 1.3047, 1.5102, 1.1130] and the trend line we fitted is [1.3813, 1.33675, 1.2922, 1.24765] which are not exactly the same.\n\n      We can compute the seasonal index for a given hour as the average of (actual value for that hour / trend_value for that day) over the 4 days.\n\n      Then for forecasting, we do: forecast = trend_value for the day * seasonal_index for the hour.\n\n    However, note: we have only 4 days, so for each hour we have 4 observations. \n\n    But we are going to use the trend line for the next 4 days (x=5,6,7,8) as above.\n\n 3. Let's compute the seasonal indices:\n\n    We'll create a matrix of 24 rows (hours) and 4 columns (days). Then for each hour i (0-23) and day j (1-4):\n\n        ratio_{i,j} = (observed value at hour i on day j) / (trend_value for day j)\n\n    Then the seasonal index for hour i is the average of the ratios for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n    But note: we have to normalize the seasonal indices so that the average over a day is 1? \n\n    Actually, the trend_value for a day is the average of the day? Then the average of the ratios for a day should be 1? But because we are using the trend line (which is the estimated daily level) we don't guarantee that. \n\n    Alternatively, we can compute the seasonal indices without de-trending? \n\n    Given the complexity and the small data, we might avoid de-trending and instead use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the trend for the day? \n\n    We can do:\n\n        base_hourly_pattern = average of the hour i over the 4 days.\n\n        Then for the next days, we adjust the base_hourly_pattern by the trend factor for that day? \n\n        Specifically, we can compute:\n\n          forecast for hour i on day j (j=5,6,7,8) = (trend_value for day j) * (base_hourly_pattern[i] / overall_average)\n\n        where overall_average is the average of all 96 points? \n\n        But note: the overall average of the 96 points is (31.92+31.313+36.244+26.711)/4 = (125.188)/4 = 31.297 -> but wait, that's the total sum? Actually, the overall average per hour is 125.188/96 = 1.304\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the daily averages: 1.3145 (1.33+1.3047+1.5102+1.1130)/4 = 1.3145).\n\n        So:\n\n          forecast_{i,j} = (trend_value_j) * (base_hourly_pattern[i] / 1.3145)\n\n    Why? Because if the base_hourly_pattern[i] is the average for that hour, and 1.3145 is the average of the daily averages, then the ratio (base_hourly_pattern[i] / 1.3145) is the seasonal index.\n\n 4. Steps:\n\n    a) Compute base_hourly_pattern: for each hour (0 to 23), average the 4 values we have.\n\n        hour0: (1.097 (day1) + 1.066 (day2) + 1.553 (day3) + 1.157 (day4)) / 4\n        hour1: (1.218+1.279+1.432+1.097)/4\n        ... \n\n    b) Compute the overall average of the daily averages: 1.3145 (as above)\n\n    c) For the next 4 days (day5 to day8, which are 2017-08-09 to 2017-08-12), we have the trend_value for each day: \n          day5 (x=5): 1.2031\n          day6 (x=6): 1.15855\n          day7 (x=7): 1.114\n          day8 (x=8): 1.06945\n\n    d) Then for hour i on day5: \n          forecast = 1.2031 * (base_hourly_pattern[i] / 1.3145)\n\n    e) Similarly for the other days.\n\n 5. But note: the data provided ends at 2017-08-08 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n        2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-09 23:00:00 -> day5\n        2017-08-10 00:00:00 to 2017-08-10 23:00:00 -> day6\n        2017-08-11 00:00:00 to 2017-08-11 23:00:00 -> day7\n        2017-08-12 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00 -> day8\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step a: Compute base_hourly_pattern (for 24 hours)\n\n        hour0: (1.097, 1.066, 1.553, 1.157) -> average = (1.097+1.066+1.553+1.157)/4 = 4.873/4 = 1.21825\n        hour1: (1.218, 1.279, 1.432, 1.097) -> (1.218+1.279+1.432+1.097)=5.026 -> 1.2565\n        hour2: (1.249, 1.097, 1.523, 1.066) -> 1.249+1.097+1.523+1.066=4.935 -> 1.23375\n        hour3: (1.157, 1.188, 1.462, 0.883) -> 1.157+1.188+1.462+0.883=4.69 -> 1.1725\n        hour4: (1.279, 1.097, 1.249, 0.853) -> 1.279+1.097+1.249+0.853=4.478 -> 1.1195\n        hour5: (1.340, 1.097, 1.553, 0.670) -> 1.340+1.097+1.553+0.670=4.66 -> 1.165\n        hour6: (1.492, 1.310, 1.675, 0.883) -> 1.492+1.310+1.675+0.883=5.36 -> 1.34\n        hour7: (1.462, 1.371, 1.523, 0.883) -> 1.462+1.371+1.523+0.883=5.239 -> 1.30975\n        hour8: (1.462, 1.310, 1.523, 1.218) -> 1.462+1.310+1.523+1.218=5.513 -> 1.37825\n        hour9: (1.340, 1.310, 1.706, 1.249) -> 1.340+1.310+1.706+1.249=5.605 -> 1.40125\n        hour10: (0.975, 1.401, 1.584, 1.188) -> 0.975+1.401+1.584+1.188=5.148 -> 1.287\n        hour11: (1.005, 1.432, 1.645, 1.127) -> 1.005+1.432+1.645+1.127=5.209 -> 1.30225\n        hour12: (1.340, 1.249, 1.492, 1.492) -> 1.340+1.249+1.492+1.492=5.573 -> 1.39325\n        hour13: (1.401, 1.401, 1.462, 1.218) -> 1.401+1.401+1.462+1.218=5.482 -> 1.3705\n        hour14: (0.975, 1.340, 1.492, 1.127) -> 0.975+1.340+1.492+1.127=4.934 -> 1.2335\n        hour15: (1.249, 1.401, 1.492, 1.249) -> 1.249+1.401+1.492+1.249=5.391 -> 1.34775\n        hour16: (1.310, 1.432, 1.553, 1.401) -> 1.310+1.432+1.553+1.401=5.696 -> 1.424\n        hour17: (1.401, 1.279, 1.005, 1.401) -> 1.401+1.279+1.005+1.401=5.086 -> 1.2715\n        hour18: (1.432, 1.492, 1.157, 1.279) -> 1.432+1.492+1.157+1.279=5.36 -> 1.34\n        hour19: (1.614, 1.340, 1.310, 1.249) -> 1.614+1.340+1.310+1.249=5.513 -> 1.37825\n        hour20: (1.706, 1.401, 1.858, 1.157) -> 1.706+1.401+1.858+1.157=6.122 -> 1.5305\n        hour21: (1.980, 1.462, 1.645, 0.914) -> 1.980+1.462+1.645+0.914=6.001 -> 1.50025\n        hour22: (1.279, 1.279, 1.858, 1.036) -> 1.279+1.279+1.858+1.036=5.452 -> 1.363\n        hour23: (1.157, 1.279, 1.492, 0.914) -> 1.157+1.279+1.492+0.914=4.842 -> 1.2105\n\n   Step b: overall average of daily averages = 1.3145\n\n   Step c: trend values for next 4 days: \n        day5: 2017-08-09 -> 1.2031\n        day6: 2017-08-10 -> 1.15855\n        day7: 2017-08-11 -> 1.114\n        day8: 2017-08-12 -> 1.06945\n\n   Step d: For each hour in [0,23] and for each day in [5,6,7,8]:\n\n        forecast = trend_value(day) * (base_hourly_pattern[hour] / 1.3145)\n\n   Example: \n        hour0 on day5 (2017-08-09 00:00:00): \n            = 1.2031 * (1.21825 / 1.3145) = 1.2031 * 0.9267 = 1.115\n\n        hour1 on day5: 1.2031 * (1.2565/1.3145) = 1.2031 * 0.9559 = 1.150\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 6. We generate 96 points: 24 hours * 4 days.\n\n 7. Format: \n        We must output the date and the forecasted LULL value.\n\n        The next date after 2017-08-08 23:00:00 is 2017-08-09 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n\n 8. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says there may be missing values in the data? But we are forecasting without gaps. We are generating 96 consecutive hours.\n\n Let's code the calculation in a table? We can do:\n\n   base_pattern = [1.21825, 1.2565, 1.23375, 1.1725, 1.1195, 1.165, 1.34, 1.30975, 1.37825, 1.40125, 1.287, 1.30225, \n                  1.39325, 1.3705, 1.2335, 1.34775, 1.424, 1.2715, 1.34, 1.37825, 1.5305, 1.50025, 1.363, 1.2105]\n\n   overall_avg = 1.3145\n\n   trend_next = [1.2031, 1.15855, 1.114, 1.06945]   # for day5, day6, day7, day8\n\n   Then for day_index in [0,1,2,3] (representing day5 to day8) and hour in [0,23]:\n\n        value = trend_next[day_index] * (base_pattern[hour] / overall_avg)\n\n   And the date: \n        start_date = 2017-08-09 00:00:00\n        then add hours: 0 to 23 for 2017-08-09, then 0 to 23 for 2017-08-10, etc.\n\n 9. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        base_date = datetime(2017, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0)\n        for day in range(4):   # 4 days\n            for hour in range(24): # 24 hours per day\n                current_date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # but note: we are iterating by hour, so we can do:\n                #   base_date + timedelta(days=day) + timedelta(hours=hour)\n\n        Actually, we can do: \n            base_date = datetime(2017,8,9,0,0,0)\n            for i in range(96):\n                date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n                # then compute the day_index = i // 24   (0 for first 24, then 1,2,3)\n                # hour_index = i % 24\n\n        Then value = trend_next[day_index] * (base_pattern[hour_index] / 1.3145)\n\n 10. We must output the date in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 11. Let's compute the first few:\n\n        i=0: day_index=0, hour_index=0 -> \n            value = 1.2031 * (1.21825/1.3145) = 1.2031 * 0.9267 = 1.115 (approx)\n\n        i=1: day_index=0, hour_index=1 -> \n            value = 1.2031 * (1.2565/1.3145) = 1.2031 * 0.9559 = 1.150\n\n        ... \n\n 12. We'll compute all 96.\n\n However, note: the base_pattern we computed from the past 4 days. We are assuming the pattern holds.\n\n 13. We output the data frame with 96 rows.\n\n Let's code it in the answer.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n However, we are rounding the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n Implementation in the answer:\n\n   We'll generate the dates and the values.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        base_date = \"2017-08-09 00:00:00\"\n        Then for i in range(96):\n            date = base_date + i hours\n            day_index = i // 24   (0,1,2,3)\n            hour_index = i % 24\n\n            value = trend_next[day_index] * (base_pattern[hour_index] / 1.3145)\n\n            round(value, 3)\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-09 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-08-09 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-08-12 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n 14. Let's compute the first two:\n\n        base_pattern[0] = 1.21825 -> 1.21825/1.3145 = 0.9267\n        day0 trend = 1.2031 -> 1.2031 * 0.9267 = 1.115 (let me calculate: 1.2031 * 0.9267 = 1.115 (approx) -> 1.115)\n\n        base_pattern[1] = 1.2565 -> 1.2565/1.3145 = 0.9559\n        1.2031 * 0.9559 = 1.150 (approx) -> 1.150\n\n 15. We'll compute all and round to 3 decimals.\n\n 16. We note: the base_pattern and the overall_avg are computed from the data, and the trend_next is from the linear regression.\n\n 17. We output the 96 lines.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values? But we are not given any in the input, and we are forecasting without gaps.\n\n We'll generate the 96 points.\n\n Let's code the answer.\n\n But note: the base_pattern and the trend_next are computed with more than 3 decimals, so we'll do the calculation and then round.\n\n We'll write a small program in our mind to generate the 96 values.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   base_pattern = [ ... 24 values ... ]\n\n   trend_next = [1.2031, 1.15855, 1.114, 1.06945]\n\n   overall_avg = 1.3145\n\n   for day in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            value = trend_next[day] * (base_pattern[hour] / overall_avg)\n            rounded_value = round(value, 3)\n\n   Then the date: \n        day0: 2017-08-09, hour0: 00:00:00 -> \"2017-08-09 00:00:00\"\n        ...\n\n 18.
