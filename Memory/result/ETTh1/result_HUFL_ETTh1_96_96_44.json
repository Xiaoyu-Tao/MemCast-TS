        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data will have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we assume that the provided data is complete for the past.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n\n 3. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the future? But the problem says to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must output 96 values without any missing values.\n\n 4. We choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the seasonality (daily and weekly), we can use a model that captures multiple seasonality. However, with only 96 points (4 days) we have limited history.\n\n 5. Considering the small history, we have 4 days of data, which might show daily patterns. We can try to capture the daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 6. We can use a simple seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) or ARIMA. However, with only 96 points, complex models might not be stable.\n\n 7. Another approach is to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. But note: the data starts on 2016-12-24 (Christmas Eve) and the next 4 days include Christmas and the following days. There might be a holiday effect, but we don't have enough data to model holidays.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n    - Compute the average of each hour of the day for the 4 days we have, and then use that average for the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    - But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the last day: \n        2016-12-27: starts at 10.784, then 10.717, 9.444, ... and ends at 12.257. \n        The previous days: \n        2016-12-24: started at 15.807 and ended at 7.502\n        2016-12-25: started at 8.372 and ended at 10.516\n        2016-12-26: started at 12.860 and ended at 9.779\n\n    There is no clear trend over the 4 days, but there is a daily pattern.\n\n 9. We can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days. Since we have 4 days, we can take the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    For example, for hour 00:00: \n        Day1: 15.807 (2016-12-24)\n        Day2: 8.372 (2016-12-25)\n        Day3: 12.860 (2016-12-26)\n        Day4: 10.784 (2016-12-27)\n        Average = (15.807 + 8.372 + 12.860 + 10.784) / 4 = 11.95575\n\n    Then the forecast for 2016-12-28 00:00:00 would be 11.95575.\n\n    Similarly, for hour 01:00:\n        Day1: 15.807\n        Day2: 7.971\n        Day3: 13.329\n        Day4: 10.717\n        Average = (15.807+7.971+13.329+10.717)/4 = 11.956\n\n    And so on.\n\n 10. However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-27) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might be complex.\n\n 12. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, the average by hour might be a reasonable approach.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. For the forecast, we are to provide 96 points without missing values.\n\n 14. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps (from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00) and assign the HUFL values as the average of the same hour from the 4 available days.\n\n 15. Steps for generating the forecast:\n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have 4 observations (from 4 days).\n      - Compute the average for that hour.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), for each hour, use the computed average for that hour of the day.\n\n 16. Example: \n        Hour 0: average = (value from 24,25,26,27 at 00:00) as above.\n        Hour 1: similarly.\n\n 17. This will give a forecast that repeats the average daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 18. Let's code this in the answer.\n\n 19. We must output the data in the exact format as the input, but for the next 96 dates.\n\n 20. Generate the dates: \n        Start: 2016-12-28 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-12-27 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-12-28 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n\n 21. Format: \n        date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n        HUFL: as a float with 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places.\n\n 22. We'll compute the average for each hour (0-23) from the 4 days.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Step 1: Parse the given data. We have 96 rows. We can group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and then take the average.\n\n    Step 2: There are 4 days, so for each hour we have 4 values.\n\n    Step 3: For the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours), we assign:\n        Day 5 (2016-12-28): hour0, hour1, ... hour23 -> use the average for hour0, hour1, ... hour23\n        Day 6 (2016-12-29): same as above\n        Day 7 (2016-12-30): same\n        Day 8 (2016-12-31): same\n\n 23. We'll write the output in the required format.\n\n 24. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output 96 lines.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n However, note: the data we are given is from 2016-12-24 to 2016-12-27 (4 days). We are forecasting the next 4 days: 2016-12-28 to 2016-12-31.\n\n 25. We'll compute the averages:\n\n    We can create a list for each hour (0-23) and then average.\n\n    Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n        indices: 0, 24, 48, 72 -> values: 15.807, 8.372, 12.860, 10.784 -> average = (15.807+8.372+12.860+10.784)/4 = 11.95575 -> round to 3 decimals: 11.956\n\n    Similarly for others.\n\n 26. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-28 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-12-31 23:00:00\n\n 27. We'll create a list of 96 values by repeating the 24 averaged hours for 4 days.\n\n 28. Write the output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-28 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-12-28 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-12-31 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 29. We must not omit any.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n    For hour in 0..23:\n        values = []\n        for day in 0..3:\n            index = day*24 + hour\n            values.append(HUFL[index])\n        avg = sum(values) / 4.0\n\n 30. Then for the forecast:\n\n        for day in 0..3:   # 4 days: 28,29,30,31\n            for hour in 0..23:\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)   # but note: we are starting at 2016-12-28 00:00:00\n                value = hourly_avg[hour]\n\n 31. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 32. We'll use Python to compute, but since we are writing the answer, we can compute manually? But 24 averages, so we can write a small code in our mind.\n\n However, we are an AI, so we can compute.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00): [15.807, 8.372, 12.860, 10.784] -> 15.807+8.372=24.179; 24.179+12.860=37.039; 37.039+10.784=47.823 -> 47.823/4 = 11.95575 -> 11.956\n    Hour 1 (01:00): [15.807, 7.971, 13.329, 10.717] -> 15.807+7.971=23.778; 23.778+13.329=37.107; 37.107+10.717=47.824 -> 47.824/4=11.956\n    Hour 2 (02:00): [15.137, 7.770, 13.530, 9.444] -> 15.137+7.770=22.907; 22.907+13.530=36.437; 36.437+9.444=45.881 -> 45.881/4=11.47025 -> 11.470\n    Hour 3 (03:00): [14.602, 6.899, 13.061, 8.707] -> 14.602+6.899=21.501; 21.501+13.061=34.562; 34.562+8.707=43.269 -> 43.269/4=10.81725 -> 10.817\n    Hour 4 (04:00): [13.396, 7.971, 9.511, 9.243] -> 13.396+7.971=21.367; 21.367+9.511=30.878; 30.878+9.243=40.121 -> 40.121/4=10.03025 -> 10.030\n    Hour 5 (05:00): [13.530, 7.301, 10.047, 10.851] -> 13.530+7.301=20.831; 20.831+10.047=30.878; 30.878+10.851=41.729 -> 41.729/4=10.43225 -> 10.432\n    Hour 6 (06:00): [14.468, 6.832, 9.511, 11.788] -> 14.468+6.832=21.3; 21.3+9.511=30.811; 30.811+11.788=42.599 -> 42.599/4=10.64975 -> 10.650\n    Hour 7 (07:00): [16.209, 7.502, 11.320, 12.726] -> 16.209+7.502=23.711; 23.711+11.320=35.031; 35.031+12.726=47.757 -> 47.757/4=11.93925 -> 11.939\n    Hour 8 (08:00): [13.396, 9.109, 10.181, 11.989] -> 13.396+9.109=22.505; 22.505+10.181=32.686; 32.686+11.989=44.675 -> 44.675/4=11.16875 -> 11.169\n    Hour 9 (09:00): [9.511, 9.444, 9.109, 12.860] -> 9.511+9.444=18.955; 18.955+9.109=28.064; 28.064+12.860=40.924 -> 40.924/4=10.231\n    Hour 10 (10:00): [9.511, 9.109, 10.315, 11.788] -> 9.511+9.109=18.62; 18.62+10.315=28.935; 28.935+11.788=40.723 -> 40.723/4=10.18075 -> 10.181\n    Hour 11 (11:00): [11.655, 10.382, 11.186, 12.592] -> 11.655+10.382=22.037; 22.037+11.186=33.223; 33.223+12.592=45.815 -> 45.815/4=11.45375 -> 11.454\n    Hour 12 (12:00): [9.645, 8.306, 9.243, 9.243] -> 9.645+8.306=17.951; 17.951+9.243=27.194; 27.194+9.243=36.437 -> 36.437/4=9.10925 -> 9.109\n    Hour 13 (13:00): [10.047, 9.645, 9.176, 10.449] -> 10.047+9.645=19.692; 19.692+9.176=28.868; 28.868+10.449=39.317 -> 39.317/4=9.82925 -> 9.829\n    Hour 14 (14:00): [9.511, 8.640, 9.846, 10.650] -> 9.511+8.640=18.151; 18.151+9.846=27.997; 27.997+10.650=38.647 -> 38.647/4=9.66175 -> 9.662\n    Hour 15 (15:00): [9.243, 9.042, 9.578, 9.578] -> 9.243+9.042=18.285; 18.285+9.578=27.863; 27.863+9.578=37.441 -> 37.441/4=9.36025 -> 9.360\n    Hour 16 (16:00): [9.042, 8.306, 10.315, 9.645] -> 9.042+8.306=17.348; 17.348+10.315=27.663; 27.663+9.645=37.308 -> 37.308/4=9.327\n    Hour 17 (17:00): [10.248, 9.779, 10.784, 10.985] -> 10.248+9.779=20.027; 20.027+10.784=30.811; 30.811+10.985=41.796 -> 41.796/4=10.449\n    Hour 18 (18:00): [9.846, 9.310, 10.181, 10.985] -> 9.846+9.310=19.156; 19.156+10.181=29.337; 29.337+10.985=40.322 -> 40.322/4=10.0805 -> 10.081\n    Hour 19 (19:00): [9.645, 8.640, 9.444, 10.717] -> 9.645+8.640=18.285; 18.285+9.444=27.729; 27.729+10.717=38.446 -> 38.446/4=9.6115 -> 9.612\n    Hour 20 (20:00): [8.707, 7.770, 8.439, 9.578] -> 8.707+7.770=16.477; 16.477+8.439=24.916; 24.916+9.578=34.494 -> 34.494/4=8.6235 -> 8.624\n    Hour 21 (21:00): [7.502, 6.363, 7.904, 8.439] -> 7.502+6.363=13.865; 13.865+7.904=21.769; 21.769+8.439=30.208 -> 30.208/4=7.552\n    Hour 22 (22:00): [7.368, 7.770, 9.846, 10.985] -> 7.368+7.770=15.138; 15.138+9.846=24.984; 24.984+10.985=35.969 -> 35.969/4=8.99225 -> 8.992\n    Hour 23 (23:00): [7.502, 10.516, 9.779, 12.257] -> 7.502+10.516=18.018; 18.018+9.779=27.797; 27.797+12.257=40.054 -> 40.054/4=10.0135 -> 10.014\n\n 33.
