        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We must generate a forecast for the next 96 points. Since the data is time series, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends.\n 3. Given the data, we observe a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). The values are more negative during the day (especially in the evening) and less negative or positive at night.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal model. Since we have hourly data and a clear daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal autoregressive model or exponential smoothing.\n - However, note that the data is only 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). This is a short history, so we must be cautious.\n\n Considering simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the day by taking the same hour from the last available day (or average of last few days?).\n   - But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days (Wednesday to Saturday). We don't have a full week. However, we are forecasting the next 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday?).\n\n Let's check the dates:\n   - 2017-03-22: Wednesday\n   - 2017-03-23: Thursday\n   - 2017-03-24: Friday\n   - 2017-03-25: Saturday\n\n We are to forecast:\n   - 2017-03-26: Sunday\n   - 2017-03-27: Monday\n   - 2017-03-28: Tuesday\n   - 2017-03-29: Wednesday\n\n Since we don't have a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday in the history, we cannot use a seasonal naive that uses the same day of the week.\n\n Alternative: use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But note the pattern might change by day of week.\n\n However, the data is very limited. We can try to use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the last 4 days (if we think the pattern is similar) or we use the last day (Saturday) for Sunday, then Monday might be similar to the previous Monday? But we don't have Monday.\n\n Since we don't have day-of-week information for the same days, we can do:\n\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   Option 2: Use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n However, note that the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last few days:\n\n   The values on 2017-03-25 (Saturday) are generally higher (less negative) than the previous days? \n\n   We can try to use a seasonal naive with a drift? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n How to compute:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) in the forecast period (which is 96 hours, 4 days), we do:\n\n      forecast for 2017-03-26 h: average of h on 2017-03-22, 2017-03-23, 2017-03-24, 2017-03-25\n      similarly for 2017-03-27 h: same average? or we can use the same because we don't have more?\n\n   But note: the next 4 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We don't have Sunday in the history, so we use the average of the same hour of the past 4 days for Sunday? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same average for all 4 days? That would be a flat forecast for the same hour across the next 4 days.\n\n   However, we might expect a weekly pattern? But we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality (only 4 days). So we assume the daily pattern is consistent.\n\n   Therefore, for each hour of the day, we compute the average of that hour from the 4 available days and use that for every day in the forecast.\n\n   But note: the last day (Saturday) might be different because it's a weekend? We might expect Sunday to be similar to Saturday? But we don't have previous Sunday.\n\n   Since we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality, we will use the same daily pattern for all forecasted days.\n\n   So:\n      Let H_h = (value_h from day1 + value_h from day2 + value_h from day3 + value_h from day4) / 4\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast (4 days), the hour h will be H_h.\n\n   However, we can also consider using the last day (Saturday) for Sunday, and then the average for the rest? But without more information, we stick to the average.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: \n        2017-03-22 00:00:00 -1.066\n        2017-03-23 00:00:00 -0.497\n        2017-03-24 00:00:00  0.355\n        2017-03-25 00:00:00  0.178\n        average = (-1.066 -0.497 + 0.355 + 0.178)/4 = (-1.03)/4 = -0.2575\n\n   Similarly for each hour.\n\n   We'll compute the 24 hourly averages and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n   Step 2: Create the next 96 timestamps: from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 3: Assign the corresponding hourly average to each hour in the forecast period.\n\n   However, note: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture. We are not adjusting for trend.\n\n   This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n   But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data? In the provided history, there are no missing values. So we can compute the average.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (-1.066 -0.497 + 0.355 + 0.178) / 4 = (-1.03) / 4 = -0.2575\n        hour1: (-0.071 -0.426 + 0.355 + 0.426) / 4 = (0.284) / 4 = 0.071\n        hour2: (-0.036 -0.640 + 0.604 + 0.071) / 4 = (-0.001) / 4 = -0.00025\n        hour3: (-1.208 -0.320 + 0.320 + 0.497) / 4 = (-0.711) / 4 = -0.17775\n        hour4: (-0.746 -0.817 + 0.640 + 0.497) / 4 = (-0.426) / 4 = -0.1065\n        hour5: (-0.213 -0.746 + 0.426 + 0.533) / 4 = (0.0) / 4 = 0.0\n        hour6: (-1.777 -1.883 -0.888 -0.462) / 4 = (-5.01) / 4 = -1.2525\n        hour7: (-0.497 -1.066 -0.462 -0.497) / 4 = (-2.522) / 4 = -0.6305\n        hour8: (-0.675 -0.533 + 0.355 + 0.000) / 4 = (-0.853) / 4 = -0.21325\n        hour9: (-1.848 -0.995 -0.959 -0.462) / 4 = (-4.264) / 4 = -1.066\n        hour10: (-0.959 -0.853 -1.670 + 0.462) / 4 = (-3.02) / 4 = -0.755\n        hour11: (-0.604 -2.061 -1.208 + 0.497) / 4 = (-3.376) / 4 = -0.844\n        hour12: (-1.599 -1.670 -1.883 -1.137) / 4 = (-6.289) / 4 = -1.57225\n        hour13: (-1.066 -1.883 -0.711 + 1.066) / 4 = (-2.594) / 4 = -0.6485\n        hour14: (-0.853 -1.777 -0.497 + 0.000) / 4 = (-3.127) / 4 = -0.78175\n        hour15: (-1.492 -2.025 -1.031 + 0.000) / 4 = (-4.548) / 4 = -1.137\n        hour16: (-1.564 -2.168 -0.924 -1.421) / 4 = (-6.077) / 4 = -1.51925\n        hour17: (-1.670 -1.421 -1.279 -1.706) / 4 = (-6.076) / 4 = -1.519\n        hour18: (-3.482 -1.421 -1.244 -1.848) / 4 = (-7.995) / 4 = -1.99875\n        hour19: (-3.625 -1.670 -1.599 -2.061) / 4 = (-8.955) / 4 = -2.23875\n        hour20: (-3.696 -1.564 -1.883 -1.848) / 4 = (-8.991) / 4 = -2.24775\n        hour21: (-4.762 -1.635 -2.416 -1.315) / 4 = (-10.128) / 4 = -2.532\n        hour22: (-3.020 -0.391 -1.706 -1.386) / 4 = (-6.503) / 4 = -1.62575\n        hour23: (-1.066 + 0.000 -0.426 -0.782) / 4 = (-2.274) / 4 = -0.5685\n\n   Then, for the forecast period:\n\n        2017-03-26 00:00:00 -> hour0: -0.2575\n        2017-03-26 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.071\n        ... until\n        2017-03-26 23:00:00 -> hour23: -0.5685\n\n        and then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n   But note: the last day of history is Saturday (2017-03-25) and the first forecast day is Sunday. We are using the same pattern for Sunday as for the average of the past 4 days (which included Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). This might not be ideal, but without more data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n   We'll generate the next 96 timestamps and assign the hourly average accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we must output 96 lines.\n\n   Format: \n        <answer>\n        date and time in the same format, then the MULL value (with 3 decimal places?
