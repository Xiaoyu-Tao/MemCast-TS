        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) metric.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can consider models like:\n    - ARIMA (with potential seasonality of 24 hours)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality)\n    - Prophet (which handles seasonality and missing data well)\n\n 3. Since the data is at an hourly level and we observe a daily pattern (24-hour cycle), we should account for seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that we are only given 4 days (96 hours) of data. This is a very short history for fitting a seasonal model, especially for a 24-hour cycle. \n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can try a simple approach:\n    - We can use the average of the same hour from the previous days to forecast the next day, and then extend to 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 6. But note: the data shows a trend? Looking at the data, the values on 2017-01-21 and 2017-01-22 are generally higher than the following days. \n    There seems to be a downward trend. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a long-term trend.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n 8. Since we are to forecast 96 points and we have 4 days of history, we can compute the average for each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the data shows a downward trend. So the next 4 days might be lower? However, without more data, it's difficult to project the trend.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the last day (2017-01-24) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous day? But again, we have very limited data.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to forecast 4 days (96 hours) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can use the following method:\n\n     - We compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have. Then we use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n     However, note that the data on 2017-01-24 is significantly lower than the first two days. So the average might be a compromise.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-24) as the forecast for the next day? But then we need 4 days. We can repeat the last day 4 times? That doesn't seem right.\n\n 12. Considering the downward trend, we might project a continued decline? But without more data, it's risky.\n\n 13. Given the ambiguity, I propose to use the average by hour over the 4 days. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out the day-to-day variations.\n\n 14. Steps for averaging by hour:\n     - Group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the date).\n     - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n 15. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 16. However, note that the data starts at 2017-01-21 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-01-24 23:00:00. The next 96 hours will be from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00.\n\n 17. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 18. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.402 + 0.536 -0.335 -1.942) / 4 = (0.402+0.536 = 0.938; 0.938-0.335=0.603; 0.603-1.942 = -1.339) -> -1.339/4 = -0.33475\n     We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 19. But note: the data has negative values and we are averaging.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But we only have 4 points per hour.\n\n 21. Given the data, let's compute the average for each hour.\n\n 22. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then take the mean.\n\n 23. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, which are consecutive and from the same week? We don't have information about the day of the week.\n\n 24. Since we don't have enough data to capture weekly patterns, we stick to daily.\n\n 25. Implementation:\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0..23) and then for each hour, we take the 4 values and average.\n\n 26. But note: the data for the same hour on different days might be very different (like hour 5: 0.536, -1.875, -0.871, -2.612). The average for hour 5: (0.536 -1.875 -0.871 -2.612)/4 = (-4.822)/4 = -1.2055.\n\n 27. Then we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-25 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> average for hour0\n        2017-01-25 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> average for hour1\n        ... until 2017-01-25 23:00:00 -> hour23\n        then 2017-01-26 00:00:00 -> hour0 again, and so on for 4 days.\n\n 28. We must format the dates correctly.\n\n 29. However, note that the data we are given is in the past. We are to forecast the next 96 hours starting from 2017-01-25 00:00:00.\n\n 30. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll extract the hour from the datetime string.\n\n 31. Since the data is:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-21 (Saturday) -> 24 hours\n        Day2: 2017-01-22 (Sunday)\n        Day3: 2017-01-23 (Monday)\n        Day4: 2017-01-24 (Tuesday)\n\n     The next 4 days: \n        2017-01-25 (Wednesday)\n        2017-01-26 (Thursday)\n        2017-01-27 (Friday)\n        2017-01-28 (Saturday)\n\n     But we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality (only one Saturday, one Sunday, etc.), so we ignore the day of the week and use the hourly average.\n\n 32. Compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a dictionary for each hour (0 to 23) and accumulate the values.\n\n     Hour 0: [0.402, 0.536, -0.335, -1.942] -> mean = (0.402+0.536-0.335-1.942)/4 = (0.938 - 2.277) /4 = (-1.339)/4 = -0.33475\n     Hour 1: [0.737, 0.268, -0.938, -2.143] -> (0.737+0.268-0.938-2.143)/4 = (1.005 - 3.081)/4 = (-2.076)/4 = -0.519\n     Hour 2: [0.000, 0.134, -0.737, -2.277] -> (0.000+0.134-0.737-2.277)/4 = (0.134 - 3.014)/4 = (-2.88)/4 = -0.72\n     Hour 3: [0.469, 0.268, -0.670, -2.478] -> (0.469+0.268-0.670-2.478)/4 = (0.737 - 3.148)/4 = (-2.411)/4 = -0.60275\n     Hour 4: [0.536, 0.134, -1.407, -2.612] -> (0.536+0.134-1.407-2.612)/4 = (0.67 - 4.019)/4 = (-3.349)/4 = -0.83725\n     Hour 5: [0.536, -1.875, -0.871, -2.612] -> (0.536-1.875-0.871-2.612)/4 = (0.536 - 5.358)/4 = (-4.822)/4 = -1.2055\n     Hour 6: [0.201, -0.804, -1.474, -2.880] -> (0.201-0.804-1.474-2.880)/4 = (0.201 - 5.158)/4 = (-4.957)/4 = -1.23925\n     Hour 7: [0.469, -0.402, -0.670, -2.612] -> (0.469-0.402-0.670-2.612)/4 = (0.067 - 3.282)/4 = (-3.215)/4 = -0.80375\n     Hour 8: [1.273, 0.134, 0.000, -2.009] -> (1.273+0.134+0.000-2.009)/4 = (1.407 - 2.009)/4 = (-0.602)/4 = -0.1505\n     Hour 9: [0.000, 0.000, 0.067, -2.076] -> (0.000+0.000+0.067-2.076)/4 = (0.067 - 2.076)/4 = (-2.009)/4 = -0.50225\n     Hour 10: [0.603, 0.201, 0.067, -1.541] -> (0.603+0.201+0.067-1.541)/4 = (0.871 - 1.541)/4 = (-0.67)/4 = -0.1675\n     Hour 11: [0.469, 0.536, 0.469, -0.871] -> (0.469+0.536+0.469-0.871)/4 = (1.474 - 0.871)/4 = (0.603)/4 = 0.15075\n     Hour 12: [0.938, 0.536, -0.469, -0.737] -> (0.938+0.536-0.469-0.737)/4 = (1.474 - 1.206)/4 = (0.268)/4 = 0.067\n     Hour 13: [1.273, 0.335, -0.201, -1.072] -> (1.273+0.335-0.201-1.072)/4 = (1.608 - 1.273)/4 = (0.608 - 1.273) -> wait, let me recalculate: \n          1.273 + 0.335 = 1.608; 1.608 - 0.201 = 1.407; 1.407 - 1.072 = 0.335 -> 0.335/4 = 0.08375\n     Hour 14: [1.273, 0.603, -1.005, -1.273] -> (1.273+0.603-1.005-1.273)/4 = (1.876 - 2.278)/4 = (-0.402)/4 = -0.1005\n     Hour 15: [0.201, -0.134, -1.273, -1.942] -> (0.201-0.134-1.273-1.942)/4 = (0.067 - 3.215)/4 = (-3.148)/4 = -0.787\n     Hour 16: [-0.402, -0.871, -2.009, -2.076] -> (-0.402-0.871-2.009-2.076)/4 = (-5.358)/4 = -1.3395\n     Hour 17: [-0.737, -0.670, -2.009, -1.741] -> (-0.737-0.670-2.009-1.741)/4 = (-5.157)/4 = -1.28925\n     Hour 18: [-0.938, -0.737, -2.277, -1.674] -> (-0.938-0.737-2.277-1.674)/4 = (-5.626)/4 = -1.4065\n     Hour 19: [-0.134, -0.134, -1.474, -1.273] -> (-0.134-0.134-1.474-1.273)/4 = (-3.015)/4 = -0.75375\n     Hour 20: [0.000, 0.067, -1.139, -0.871] -> (0.000+0.067-1.139-0.871)/4 = (0.067 - 2.01)/4 = (-1.943)/4 = -0.48575\n     Hour 21: [1.541, 0.000, -0.938, -0.871] -> (1.541+0.000-0.938-0.871)/4 = (1.541 - 1.809)/4 = (-0.268)/4 = -0.067\n     Hour 22: [0.603, 0.603, -0.871, -1.273] -> (0.603+0.603-0.871-1.273)/4 = (1.206 - 2.144)/4 = (-0.938)/4 = -0.2345\n     Hour 23: [0.670, -0.067, -1.474, -1.808] -> (0.670-0.067-1.474-1.808)/4 = (0.603 - 3.282)/4 = (-2.679)/4 = -0.66975\n\n 33. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     Start: 2017-01-25 00:00:00 -> hour0: -0.33475\n           2017-01-25 01:00:00 -> hour1: -0.519\n           ... until 2017-01-25 23:00:00: -0.66975\n\n     Then 2017-01-26 00:00:00: -0.33475\n          2017-01-26 01:00:00: -0.519\n          ... and so on.\n\n 34. We'll generate 4 days (96 hours) of data.\n\n 35. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, with the date and the HULL value.\n\n 36. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 37. However, note: the input has values like 0.402, 0.737, etc. So we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 38. Let's write the forecast:\n\n     Day1: 2017-01-25\n        00:00:00 -> -0.335\n        01:00:00 -> -0.519\n        02:00:00 -> -0.720\n        03:00:00 -> -0.603\n        04:00:00 -> -0.837\n        05:00:00 -> -1.206\n        06:00:00 -> -1.239\n        07:00:00 -> -0.804\n        08:00:00 -> -0.151\n        09:00:00 -> -0.502\n        10:00:00 -> -0.168\n        11:00:00 -> 0.151\n        12:00:00 -> 0.067\n        13:00:00 -> 0.084\n        14:00:00 -> -0.101\n        15:00:00 -> -0.787\n        16:00:00 -> -1.340\n        17:00:00 -> -1.289\n        18:00:00 -> -1.407\n        19:00:00 -> -0.754\n        20:00:00 -> -0.486\n        21:00:00 -> -0.067\n        22:00:00 -> -0.235\n        23:00:00 -> -0.670\n\n     Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 39. But note: the averages we computed are for the hour of the day, so we use the same set for each day.\n\n 40. We generate 4 days? No, 4 days of 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n 41. We'll generate:\n\n        for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n                date = 2017-01-25 + day_offset days\n                time = hour:00:00\n                value = the average for that hour (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n 42. The starting date is 2017-01-25.\n\n 43. We must be cautious: the last date in the input is 2017-01-24 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-01-25 00:00:00.\n\n 44. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 45. Let's code this in the output.\n\n 46. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are generating without missing values.\n\n 47. We output in the required format.\n\n 48. We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-25 00:00:00  -0.335\n2017-01-25 01:00:00  -0.519\n... \n2017-01-28 23:00:00  -0.670\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 49. But note: we computed the averages and then rounded. We must round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 50. Let me recheck the rounding for the first few:\n\n        Hour0: -0.33475 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.335\n        Hour1: -0.519 -> already 3 decimals? Actually, we have -0.519, which is -0.519.\n\n 51. We'll write the full 96 lines.\n\n 52. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta (but we don't need to import, we can just write the dates)\n\n        Start: 2017-01-25, then 2017-01-26, 2017-01-27, 2017-01-28.\n\n 53. We'll list:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-25\n        Day2: 2017-01-26\n        Day3: 2017-01-27\n        Day4: 2017-01-28\n\n 54. Now, we write the data.\n\n 55. Note: the input had the HULL column with 3 decimal places, so we format the numbers to have 3 decimal places.\n\n 56. We'll write:\n\n        [date string]  [value formatted to 3 decimals]\n\n 57. We must align the dates and values as in the example.\n\n 58. Let's do it.\n\n 59. We have the hourly averages as a list for hours 0 to 23:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            -0.33475,   # hour0\n            -0.519,     # hour1\n            -0.72,      # hour2\n            -0.60275,   # hour3\n            -0.83725,   # hour4\n            -1.2055,    # hour5\n            -1.23925,   # hour6\n            -0.80375,   # hour7\n            -0.1505,    # hour8\n            -0.50225,   # hour9\n            -0.1675,    # hour10\n            0.15075,    # hour11\n            0.067,      # hour12\n            0.08375,    # hour13\n            -0.1005,    # hour14\n            -0.787,     # hour15\n            -1.3395,    # hour16\n            -1.28925,   # hour17\n            -1.4065,    # hour18\n            -0.75375,   # hour19\n            -0.48575,   # hour20\n            -0.067,     # hour21\n            -0.2345,    # hour22\n            -0.66975    # hour23\n        ]\n\n 60. Round each to 3 decimal places:\n\n        We'll round each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Example: \n            -0.33475 -> round(-0.33475, 3) -> -0.335\n            -0.519 -> remains -0.519\n\n        We can do: \n            [round(x, 3) for x in hourly_avg]\n\n 61. Let's compute the rounded list:\n\n        hour0: -0.335\n        hour1: -0.519\n        hour2: -0.720\n        hour3: -0.603\n        hour4: -0.837\n        hour5: -1.206\n        hour6: -1.239\n        hour7: -0.804\n        hour8: -0.151\n        hour9: -0.502\n        hour10: -0.168\n        hour11: 0.151\n        hour12: 0.067\n        hour13: 0.084\n        hour14: -0.101\n        hour15: -0.787\n        hour16: -1.340\n        hour17: -1.289\n        hour18: -1.407\n        hour19: -0.754\n        hour20: -0.486\n        hour21: -0.067\n        hour22: -0.235\n        hour23: -0.670\n\n 62. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n        day0: 2017-01-25\n        day1: 2017-01-26\n        day2: 2017-01-27\n        day3: 2017-01-28\n\n        For each day, we output 24 hours.\n\n 63. We write:\n\n        for day in range(0, 8):  # Actually 4 days: 0 to 3\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day)\n\n        But we can just write:\n\n        dates = []\n        base_date = \"2017-01-25\"\n        We'll generate:\n\n            day0: 2017-01-25\n            day1: 2017-01-26\n            day2: 2017-01-27\n            day3: 2017-01-28\n\n        Then for each day, we have 24 hours: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n 64. We'll write the data in order.\n\n 65. The final answer:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-25 00:00:00  -0.335\n2017-01-25 01:00:00  -0.519\n2017-01-25 02:00:00  -0.720\n2017-01-25 03:00:00  -0.603\n2017-01-25 04:00:00  -0.837\n2017-01-25 05:00:00  -1.206\n2017-01-25 06:00:00  -1.239\n2017-01-25 07:00:00  -0.804\n2017-01-25 08:00:00  -0.151\n2017-01-25 09:00:00  -0.502\n2017-01-25 10:00:00  -0.168\n2017-01-25 11:00:00  0.151\n2017-01-25 12:00:00  0.067\n2017-01-25 13:00:00  0.084\n2017-01-25 14:00:00  -0.101\n2017-01-25 15:00:00  -0.787\n2017-01-25 16:00:00  -1.340\n2017-01-25 17:00:00  -1.289\n2017-01-25 18:00:00  -1.407\n2017-01-25 19:00:00  -0.754\n2017-01-25 20:00:00  -0.486\n2017-01-25 21:00:00  -0.067\n2017-01-25 22:00:00  -0.235\n2017-01-25 23:00:00  -0.670\n2017-01-26 00:00:00  -0.335\n2017-01-26 01:00:00  -0.519\n... and so on for 2017-01-26, 2017-01-27, 2017-01-28.\n\n```\n\n 66. We must write 96 lines.\n\n 67. We'll generate the entire list.\n\n 68. Note: the last line should be 2017-01-28 23:00:00.\n\n 69. We are done.\n\n 70. However, note: this is a very simple method. But given the limited data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 71. We output the data as described.\n",
