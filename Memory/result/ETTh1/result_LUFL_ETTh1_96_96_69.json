        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-04-07 00:00:00 to 2017-04-10 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours in a day). Also, there might be weekly patterns but we only have 4 days of data, so we focus on daily seasonality.\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast might need to account for potential patterns and seasonality.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can capture seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality of 24, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given 4 days of data and we need to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours), we can use a simple seasonal method.\n\n One simple method is to use the seasonal naive method, which uses the observation from the same time in the previous cycle (i.e., same hour of the previous day) as the forecast.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. We might consider averaging the same hour over the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model like Holt-Winters with seasonality, but with only 4 days of data, the model might not be very stable.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the available days. Since we have 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour (across the 4 days) and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to see weekly. Also, the data starts on a Monday? (2017-04-03 is a Monday). The next 4 days would be Tuesday to Friday? Actually, 2017-04-03 is Monday, then 04 is Tuesday, 05 Wednesday, 06 Thursday. Then next 96 hours: 07 (Friday), 08 (Saturday), 09 (Sunday), 10 (Monday). So we have a weekend effect? But we don't have weekend data in the history.\n\n Given the limited data, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Use the last day (2017-04-06) as the forecast for the next day (2017-04-07) because it's the most recent. Then for the next days, we can use the same pattern? But the weekend might be different.\n\n However, without having weekend data, we cannot adjust for weekend. So we have to assume the pattern continues similarly.\n\n Option 2: Use the average of the same hour for the 4 days we have. This will smooth out the daily pattern and then we repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Let's compare the days:\n\n We have:\n   Day1: Monday (2017-04-03)\n   Day2: Tuesday (2017-04-04)\n   Day3: Wednesday (2017-04-05)\n   Day4: Thursday (2017-04-06)\n\n We are forecasting:\n   Day5: Friday (2017-04-07)\n   Day6: Saturday (2017-04-08)\n   Day7: Sunday (2017-04-09)\n   Day8: Monday (2017-04-10)\n\n Since we don't have Friday, Saturday, Sunday in the history, we cannot use a direct same-day pattern.\n\n Therefore, we will use the average of the 4 days we have for each hour to form a typical day, and then use that typical day for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   For hour h (where h from 0 to 23), let:\n        avg_h = (value_h from day1 + value_h from day2 + value_h from day3 + value_h from day4) / 4\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast period (4 days: 2017-04-07 to 2017-04-10), the value at hour h will be avg_h.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n   Day1: average of the day? around 2.3\n   Day2: around 2.4\n   Day3: around 2.4\n   Day4: around 2.5\n\n There might be a slight upward trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to say. We can also consider using a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the level.\n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, we choose the average method.\n\n How to compute:\n\n   We have 24 hours in a day, and 4 days. We group by hour (0 to 23) and average.\n\n   For example, for hour 0: \n     2017-04-03 00:00:00: 1.553\n     2017-04-04 00:00:00: 2.406\n     2017-04-05 00:00:00: 1.858\n     2017-04-06 00:00:00: 1.797\n     avg0 = (1.553 + 2.406 + 1.858 + 1.797) / 4 = 1.9035\n\n Similarly for hour 1, ... until hour 23.\n\n Then for the forecast:\n\n   Day5 (2017-04-07): \n        00:00:00 -> avg0\n        01:00:00 -> avg1\n        ... \n        23:00:00 -> avg23\n\n   Day6 (2017-04-08): same as above, use the same averages (avg0 to avg23)\n   Day7 (2017-04-09): same\n   Day8 (2017-04-10): same\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told that the future data will have missing values, but the historical data we are given does not. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n However, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we assume we are to forecast without missing values.\n\n But if we are to account for potential missing values in the future, we cannot because we are forecasting. We will provide a complete forecast.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a more sophisticated model that can handle missing values, but the historical data is complete. And the forecast is for the next 96 hours without gaps.\n\n Let's compute the averages:\n\n   hour0: [1.553, 2.406, 1.858, 1.797] -> (1.553+2.406+1.858+1.797)/4 = 1.9035\n   hour1 : [1.706, 1.949, 1.706, 1.523] -> (1.706+1.949+1.706+1.523)/4 = 1.721\n   hour2 : [1.614, 1.675, 1.767, 1.371] -> (1.614+1.675+1.767+1.371)/4 = 1.60675\n   hour3 : [1.492, 1.492, 1.675, 1.706] -> (1.492+1.492+1.675+1.706)/4 = 1.59125\n   hour4 : [1.706, 1.492, 1.858, 1.706] -> (1.706+1.492+1.858+1.706)/4 = 1.6905\n   hour5 : [1.828, 1.797, 2.163, 1.949] -> (1.828+1.797+2.163+1.949)/4 = 1.93425\n   hour6 : [2.711, 2.376, 2.955, 2.345] -> (2.711+2.376+2.955+2.345)/4 = 2.59675\n   hour7 : [2.894, 2.741, 2.924, 2.833] -> (2.894+2.741+2.924+2.833)/4 = 2.848\n   hour8 : [2.741, 2.650, 2.559, 3.015] -> (2.741+2.650+2.559+3.015)/4 = 2.74125\n   hour9 : [2.437, 2.498, 2.437, 2.833] -> (2.437+2.498+2.437+2.833)/4 = 2.55125\n   hour10: [2.772, 2.894, 2.498, 2.924] -> (2.772+2.894+2.498+2.924)/4 = 2.772\n   hour11: [3.046, 3.381, 2.955, 3.046] -> (3.046+3.381+2.955+3.046)/4 = 3.107\n   hour12: [2.315, 2.284, 2.163, 2.589] -> (2.315+2.284+2.163+2.589)/4 = 2.33775\n   hour13: [2.284, 2.284, 2.315, 2.650] -> (2.284+2.284+2.315+2.650)/4 = 2.38325\n   hour14: [2.376, 2.102, 2.163, 2.498] -> (2.376+2.102+2.163+2.498)/4 = 2.28475\n   hour15: [2.345, 2.163, 2.376, 2.619] -> (2.345+2.163+2.376+2.619)/4 = 2.37575\n   hour16: [2.254, 2.315, 2.376, 2.559] -> (2.254+2.315+2.376+2.559)/4 = 2.376\n   hour17: [2.650, 2.863, 2.802, 2.924] -> (2.650+2.863+2.802+2.924)/4 = 2.80975\n   hour18: [2.437, 2.559, 2.680, 2.467] -> (2.437+2.559+2.680+2.467)/4 = 2.53575\n   hour19: [2.650, 2.589, 2.619, 2.559] -> (2.650+2.589+2.619+2.559)/4 = 2.60425\n   hour20: [3.137, 2.680, 2.528, 2.559] -> (3.137+2.680+2.528+2.559)/4 = 2.726\n   hour21: [2.345, 2.376, 2.224, 2.163] -> (2.345+2.376+2.224+2.163)/4 = 2.277\n   hour22: [2.071, 1.919, 1.919, 2.071] -> (2.071+1.919+1.919+2.071)/4 = 2.0\n   hour23: [2.528, 2.102, 2.071, 2.102] -> (2.528+2.102+2.071+2.102)/4 = 2.20075\n\n Then we create the next 4 days:\n\n   Day1 (2017-04-07): \n        00:00:00 -> 1.9035\n        01:00:00 -> 1.721\n        ... \n        23:00:00 -> 2.20075\n\n   Day2 (2017-04-08): same as above\n   Day3 (2017-04-09): same\n   Day4 (2017-04-10): same\n\n But note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\". We must generate the timestamps.\n\n Start from: \n   Last given date: 2017-04-06 23:00:00\n   Next date: 2017-04-07 00:00:00, then 01:00:00 ... until 2017-04-10 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate 96 timestamps.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the given data is hourly. So we stick to hourly.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of dates from 2017-04-07 00:00:00 to 2017-04-10 23:00:00 (inclusive) with frequency 'H'.\n\n   Then assign the average values for each hour, repeated for each day.\n\n   The hour of the day for the forecasted day will determine which average to use.\n\n   For example, for 2017-04-07 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 1.9035\n               2017-04-07 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 1.721\n               ...\n               2017-04-07 23:00:00 -> hour23 -> 2.20075\n               2017-04-08 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 1.9035\n               and so on.\n\n Let's code this in the output.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\".\n\n We'll output 96 lines.\n\n Format:\n\n        date                LUFL\n        2017-04-07 00:00:00 1.9035\n        2017-04-07 01:00:00 1.721\n        ... \n\n However, the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's recalculate the averages and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   hour0: 1.553+2.406+1.858+1.797 = 7.614 -> 7.614/4=1.9035 -> 1.904\n   hour1: 1.706+1.949+1.706+1.523 = 6.884 -> 6.884/4=1.721 -> 1.721\n   hour2: 1.614+1.675+1.767+1.371 = 6.427 -> 6.427/4=1.60675 -> 1.607\n   hour3: 1.492+1.492+1.675+1.706 = 6.365 -> 6.365/4=1.59125 -> 1.591\n   hour4: 1.706+1.492+1.858+1.706 = 6.762 -> 6.762/4=1.6905 -> 1.691\n   hour5: 1.828+1.797+2.163+1.949 = 7.737 -> 7.737/4=1.93425 -> 1.934\n   hour6: 2.711+2.376+2.955+2.345 = 10.387 -> 10.387/4=2.59675 -> 2.597\n   hour7: 2.894+2.741+2.924+2.833 = 11.392 -> 11.392/4=2.848 -> 2.848\n   hour8: 2.741+2.650+2.559+3.015 = 10.965 -> 10.965/4=2.74125 -> 2.741\n   hour9: 2.437+2.498+2.437+2.833 = 10.205 -> 10.205/4=2.55125 -> 2.551\n   hour10: 2.772+2.894+2.498+2.924 = 11.088 -> 11.088/4=2.772 -> 2.772\n   hour11: 3.046+3.381+2.955+3.046 = 12.428 -> 12.428/4=3.107 -> 3.107\n   hour12: 2.315+2.284+2.163+2.589 = 9.351 -> 9.351/4=2.33775 -> 2.338\n   hour13: 2.284+2.284+2.315+2.650 = 9.533 -> 9.533/4=2.38325 -> 2.383\n   hour14: 2.376+2.102+2.163+2.498 = 9.139 -> 9.139/4=2.28475 -> 2.285\n   hour15: 2.345+2.163+2.376+2.619 = 9.503 -> 9.503/4=2.37575 -> 2.376\n   hour16: 2.254+2.315+2.376+2.559 = 9.504 -> 9.504/4=2.376 -> 2.376\n   hour17: 2.650+2.863+2.802+2.924 = 11.239 -> 11.239/4=2.80975 -> 2.810\n   hour18: 2.437+2.559+2.680+2.467 = 10.143 -> 10.143/4=2.53575 -> 2.536\n   hour19: 2.650+2.589+2.619+2.559 = 10.417 -> 10.417/4=2.60425 -> 2.604\n   hour20: 3.137+2.680+2.528+2.559 = 10.904 -> 10.904/4=2.726 -> 2.726\n   hour21: 2.345+2.376+2.224+2.163 = 9.108 -> 9.108/4=2.277 -> 2.277\n   hour22: 2.071+1.919+1.919+2.071 = 7.98 -> 7.98/4=1.995 -> 1.995   (Note: earlier I said 2.0, but 7.98/4=1.995 -> 1.995)\n   hour23: 2.528+2.102+2.071+2.102 = 8.803 -> 8.803/4=2.20075 -> 2.201\n\n Correction for hour22: I miscalculated earlier.
