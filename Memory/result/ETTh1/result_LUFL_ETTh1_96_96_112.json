        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern).\n 2. There might be weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly seasonality. We'll rely on daily.\n 3. We are to handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points there are none. \n    So we assume that the forecasting method should be robust to missing values, but since we are only the next 96, we can proceed without missing values in the input.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple seasonal method such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) as the forecast.\n   - However, we have 4 days of data. We can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? But note: the pattern might change.\n\n But note: the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days? \n Actually, we are only given 96 points (4 days) to base our forecast on.\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, we can use the last day (2017-09-25) as the base and adjust with the trend? \n However, without more data, it's hard to capture trend. \n\n Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonality. But with only 4 days, we cannot fit a complex model.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n   - Use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days for the next 4 days? \n   - But note: the problem says \"Low UseFul Load\", and we see that the load varies by day of the week? \n     However, we don't have the day of the week for the given data: \n        2017-09-22: Friday\n        2017-09-23: Saturday\n        2017-09-24: Sunday\n        2017-09-25: Monday\n\n     The next 4 days: \n        2017-09-26: Tuesday\n        2017-09-27: Wednesday\n        2017-09-28: Thursday\n        2017-09-29: Friday\n\n     We might expect that Friday (2017-09-29) might be similar to the previous Friday (2017-09-22) but we don't have a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in the history.\n\n 4. Another idea: use the last day (Monday) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the same day of the week? \n    But we don't have a Tuesday in the history.\n\n 5. Given the limited data, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with daily seasonality.\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert. We must provide a forecast.\n\n Considering the data, we see that the pattern each day is similar: \n   - low during night (midnight to early morning), \n   - then a peak in the morning (around 7-10 AM), \n   - then a dip at noon, \n   - then another peak in the evening? \n\n But the values are not exactly the same.\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, and we need to forecast 4 days, we can use:\n\n   Forecast for hour h of day d (where d from 26 to 29) = average of the same hour h over the last 4 days.\n\n But note: the days are different (Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday). The next days are Tuesday to Friday.\n\n We might expect that Tuesday might be more similar to Monday? But we don't have a Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Monday) for Tuesday, then Tuesday for Wednesday? But that would be the same as Monday? \n\n Given the lack of data, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23) in the next 4 days:\n   For hour h:\n        forecast = (value_h from 2017-09-22 + value_h from 2017-09-23 + value_h from 2017-09-24 + value_h from 2017-09-25) / 4\n\n But note: the data we have is for 4 consecutive days. We are going to use the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n However, we see that the load on Friday (2017-09-22) and Monday (2017-09-25) might be different from weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). \n But we don't have a Tuesday, so we use the average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same day of the week? But we only have one Friday, one Saturday, one Sunday, one Monday.\n\n Since the next days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and we don't have any Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we can only use the overall average.\n\n So, we compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average over the 4 days.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n    (1.919, 1.888, 1.736, 1.553) -> average = (1.919+1.888+1.736+1.553)/4 = 1.774\n\n But wait, the last day (Monday) at hour 0 was 1.553? and the next Tuesday at hour 0 would be 1.774.\n\n However, we note that the values for the same hour are not exactly the same. \n\n But let's check: \n   hour0: \n        2017-09-22: 1.919\n        2017-09-23: 1.888\n        2017-09-24: 1.736\n        2017-09-25: 1.553\n        average = (1.919+1.888+1.736+1.553)/4 = 1.774\n\n   hour1: \n        2017-09-22: 1.888\n        2017-09-23: 1.919\n        2017-09-24: 1.675\n        2017-09-25: 1.401\n        average = (1.888+1.919+1.675+1.401)/4 = 1.72075\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated? \n But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we will use the same 24-hour pattern for each of the 4 days? \n\n However, that would ignore the fact that weekdays and weekends are different. But we don't have enough data to model that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? \n   For Tuesday: we don't have a Tuesday, so we use the average of all days? \n   For Wednesday: same.\n   For Thursday: same.\n   For Friday: we have one Friday (2017-09-22). But we also have the average of the same hour for Friday? \n\n But we only have one Friday, so we can't average multiple Fridays.\n\n Therefore, the safest is to use the overall average for each hour.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. \n So we don't need to impute for the historical data.\n\n But for the forecast, we are generating 96 points without missing values.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of 24 values (for 0 to 23 hours) by averaging the 4 days we have.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (2017-09-26 to 2017-09-29), we assign:\n        Day1 (2017-09-26, Tuesday): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... avg_hour23]\n        Day2 (2017-09-27, Wednesday): same 24 values\n        Day3 (2017-09-28, Thursday): same 24 values\n        Day4 (2017-09-29, Friday): same 24 values\n\n But note: we see that the Friday (2017-09-22) had higher values than the weekend? \n   For example, at hour0: Friday was 1.919, Saturday 1.888, Sunday 1.736, Monday 1.553 -> average 1.774, which is lower than Friday.\n\n   So for the next Friday (2017-09-29) we are using 1.774 at hour0, which is lower than the previous Friday (1.919). \n   But we don't have a reason to adjust because we don't have another Friday.\n\n Alternatively, we can adjust by the overall level? \n\n   We can compute the average of the entire 4 days and then adjust the forecast by the trend? \n   But we don't have a clear trend in 4 days.\n\n   The overall average of the 96 points: \n        We can compute: \n            total = (sum of all 96 points) \n            average = total / 96\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days, we use the 24-hour pattern but scaled by the ratio of the last day's average to the overall average? \n   But that might be overcomplicating.\n\n Given the instructions and the limited data, I will use the simple average per hour.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n   Step 2: Generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n   Step 3: Format the dates: \n        Start: 2017-09-26 00:00:00 (next after 2017-09-25 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-09-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 4: Output the data in the required format.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We have 4 days, so for each hour (0-23) we have 4 values.\n\n   We'll compute the average for each hour.\n\n   Example for hour0 (00:00): \n        values: 1.919, 1.888, 1.736, 1.553 -> average = (1.919+1.888+1.736+1.553)/4 = 1.774\n\n   We do for all 24 hours.\n\n   We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of 24 values.\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00 -> hourly_avg[0]\n        2017-09-26 01:00:00 -> hourly_avg[1]\n        ...\n        2017-09-26 23:00:00 -> hourly_avg[23]\n        2017-09-27 00:00:00 -> hourly_avg[0]\n        ... and so on.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour0 (00:00): [1.919, 1.888, 1.736, 1.553] -> 1.774\n   hour1 (01:00): [1.888, 1.919, 1.675, 1.401] -> (1.888+1.919+1.675+1.401)/4 = 1.883+1.675=3.558, 1.401+1.888=3.289 -> let me calculate: 1.888+1.919=3.807, 1.675+1.401=3.076 -> total=6.883 -> 6.883/4=1.72075\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll do for all 24.\n\n But note: we must be cautious because the data might have a slight trend? But we are ignoring it.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median?
