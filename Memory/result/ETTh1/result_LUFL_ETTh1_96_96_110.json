        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values in the overall context. However, for forecasting, we can use the provided 96 points as a complete series.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 consecutive hourly timestamps starting from the next hour after the last given point.\n\n 3. We must choose a forecasting method. Given the data, we can observe:\n    - There is a daily pattern (circadian rhythm) because the load varies by time of day.\n    - There might be a weekly pattern, but we only have 4 days so it's hard to tell. However, the problem does not specify the day of the week for the starting date.\n\n 4. Since we are only given 4 days, we can use a simple method that captures daily seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 hours.\n\n 5. We can be:\n    - Using a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by taking the same hour of the previous day (or an average of the same hour over the available days). But note we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days? However, the last day (2017-09-17) is a Sunday? We don't have context of the day of week.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality, or an ARIMA model with seasonal components. But without the ability to run code, we have to do a simple average).\n\n 7. Given the constraints, I propose to use a simple average of the same hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours). Why 4 days? Because we have 4 days of history and we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n 8. Steps for the method:\n     - For hour 00:00: forecast = average of 00:00 on 2017-09-14, 2017-09-15, 2017-09-16, 2017-09-17.\n     - Similarly for 01:00, and so on.\n\n 9. However, note that the data might have a trend? But 4 days is too short to capture a trend. We'll assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 10. Calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n 11. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will repeat the same 24-hour pattern (the computed average for each hour) for 4 days.\n\n 12. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-09-17 (Sunday) and the next day is 2017-09-18 (Monday). If there is a weekly pattern, Monday might be different from Sunday. However, we don't have data for previous Mondays. So we have to rely on the available 4 days.\n\n 13. Since we don't have information about the days of the week, we will use the same pattern for all forecasted days.\n\n 14. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00: (2.254 + 2.010 + 2.437 + 2.650) / 4 = (2.254+2.010=4.264; 4.264+2.437=6.701; 6.701+2.650=9.351) -> 9.351/4 = 2.33775\n     Hour 01: (2.163 + 1.797 + 2.224 + 2.437) / 4 = (2.163+1.797=3.96; 3.96+2.224=6.184; 6.184+2.437=8.621) -> 8.621/4 = 2.15525\n     ... and so on.\n\n 15. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 16. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n     2017-09-18 00:00:00 -> average of hour00 = 2.33775\n     2017-09-18 01:00:00 -> average of hour01 = 2.15525\n     ... until 2017-09-18 23:00:00 (which is the average of the 23rd hour of the 4 days)\n     Then 2017-09-19 00:00:00 again 2.33775, and so on.\n\n 17. We must round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 18. However, note: the data has some variation. This method will produce a constant pattern for each day. It's simple but may be acceptable given the short history.\n\n 19.
