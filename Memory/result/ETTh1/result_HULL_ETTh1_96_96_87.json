        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also there might be weekly patterns but we only have 4 days so weekly is not captured.\n\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? \n    So for the given history, we can proceed without imputation. But for forecasting, we have to produce 96 points without any missing.\n\n 3. We choose a model: Given the hourly data and seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple seasons, 4 days of 24 hours each) and we have only 4 days of history, \n    we can use a model that captures seasonality. However, we have limited history.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal naive model, but that might not capture trends. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the short history and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that uses the daily pattern. We observe that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern: for example, the values are higher during the day and lower at night? But looking at the data, it's not very clear. \n      However, we see peaks at certain hours (like 12:00 on 2017-06-14: 4.756, 2017-06-15: 4.488, 2017-06-16: 5.760, 2017-06-17: 5.492) and lows at night.\n\n 6. We can try to decompose the series and then forecast. But with only 4 days, decomposition might be unstable.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a model that averages the same hour across the available days and then applies a trend. But the trend over 4 days is not clear.\n\n 8. Since the problem says the data will have missing values, but the provided history does not, we assume that the forecasting method should be robust to missing values. \n    However, for the given history we have no missing, so we can proceed.\n\n 9. We decide to use a simple method: \n    - Calculate the average pattern for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n    - Then, we can adjust by the overall trend of the last day? But we have only 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. \n\n    Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values. We can take the mean for each hour.\n\n    But note: the last day (2017-06-17) has a higher peak? So we might want to use the last day as more representative? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? \n\n    However, the problem does not specify the method, so we choose a simple average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 10. Steps for forecasting:\n      - For each hour in the next 96 hours (which is 4 days: 2017-06-18 to 2017-06-21), we assign the average of that hour from the 4 historical days.\n\n      But note: the data might have a slight trend? We can also consider a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n 11. However, to keep it simple and given the short history, we use the hourly average.\n\n 12. But we must generate 96 points. So we will have 4 repetitions of the 24-hour average pattern.\n\n 13. How to compute the average for each hour?\n      Hour 0: average of [2017-06-14 00:00:00, 2017-06-15 00:00:00, 2017-06-16 00:00:00, 2017-06-17 00:00:00]\n      ... and so on.\n\n 14. Let's compute the averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (1.942 + 1.139 + 1.407 + 1.674) / 4 = (1.942+1.139=3.081; 3.081+1.407=4.488; 4.488+1.674=6.162) -> 6.162/4 = 1.5405\n      Hour 1: (1.674 + 1.674 + 2.210 + 2.009) / 4 = (1.674+1.674=3.348; 3.348+2.210=5.558; 5.558+2.009=7.567) -> 7.567/4 = 1.89175\n      ... and so on.\n\n 15. However, note that the data for 2017-06-17 02:00:00 is 2.411, but in the computation above for hour 2 we have:\n\n      Hour 2: (2.277, 1.674, 2.009, 2.411) -> (2.277+1.674=3.951; 3.951+2.009=5.96; 5.96+2.411=8.371) -> 8.371/4 = 2.09275\n\n 16. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 17. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat this 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 18. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not given any in the history, but for the forecast we are to provide without missing. \n      So we just output the 96 values.\n\n 19. However, this method does not account for any trend. We have only 4 days, and the last day (2017-06-17) has the highest peak? \n      But without more history, we cannot be sure. \n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-06-17) as the pattern for the next days? But that might ignore the variability.\n\n 21. Considering the requirement for simplicity and the fact that we have very limited data, we choose the average method.\n\n 22. Let's compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (1.942 + 1.139 + 1.407 + 1.674) / 4 = 1.5405\n        hour1: (1.674 + 1.674 + 2.210 + 2.009) / 4 = (1.674+1.674=3.348, 3.348+2.210=5.558, 5.558+2.009=7.567) -> 7.567/4 = 1.89175\n        hour2: (2.277 + 1.674 + 2.009 + 2.411) / 4 = (2.277+1.674=3.951, 3.951+2.009=5.96, 5.96+2.411=8.371) -> 8.371/4 = 2.09275\n        hour3: (0.737 + 0.670 + 1.072 + 2.277) / 4 = (0.737+0.670=1.407, 1.407+1.072=2.479, 2.479+2.277=4.756) -> 4.756/4 = 1.189\n        hour4: (1.206 + 0.335 + 1.741 + 0.268) / 4 = (1.206+0.335=1.541, 1.541+1.741=3.282, 3.282+0.268=3.55) -> 3.55/4 = 0.8875\n        hour5: (1.541 + 0.000 + 1.741 + 1.005) / 4 = (1.541+0.000=1.541, 1.541+1.741=3.282, 3.282+1.005=4.287) -> 4.287/4 = 1.07175\n        hour6: (0.536 + 1.474 + 1.206 + 1.407) / 4 = (0.536+1.474=2.01, 2.01+1.206=3.216, 3.216+1.407=4.623) -> 4.623/4 = 1.15575\n        hour7: (2.210 + 2.344 + 1.808 + 1.608) / 4 = (2.210+2.344=4.554, 4.554+1.808=6.362, 6.362+1.608=7.97) -> 7.97/4 = 1.9925\n        hour8: (2.344 + 2.679 + 2.277 + 3.416) / 4 = (2.344+2.679=5.023, 5.023+2.277=7.3, 7.3+3.416=10.716) -> 10.716/4 = 2.679\n        hour9: (2.143 + 3.617 + 2.076 + 4.086) / 4 = (2.143+3.617=5.76, 5.76+2.076=7.836, 7.836+4.086=11.922) -> 11.922/4 = 2.9805\n        hour10: (1.942 + 3.416 + 3.751 + 5.693) / 4 = (1.942+3.416=5.358, 5.358+3.751=9.109, 9.109+5.693=14.802) -> 14.802/4 = 3.7005\n        hour11: (2.076 + 3.818 + 2.143 + 6.028) / 4 = (2.076+3.818=5.894, 5.894+2.143=8.037, 8.037+6.028=14.065) -> 14.065/4 = 3.51625\n        hour12: (4.756 + 4.488 + 2.478 + 5.492) / 4 = (4.756+4.488=9.244, 9.244+2.478=11.722, 11.722+5.492=17.214) -> 17.214/4 = 4.3035\n        hour13: (1.273 + 2.545 + 5.760 + 5.224) / 4 = (1.273+2.545=3.818, 3.818+5.760=9.578, 9.578+5.224=14.802) -> 14.802/4 = 3.7005\n        hour14: (2.545 + 2.746 + 5.827 + 5.760) / 4 = (2.545+2.746=5.291, 5.291+5.827=11.118, 11.118+5.760=16.878) -> 16.878/4 = 4.2195\n        hour15: (2.210 + 2.411 + 3.148 + 4.086) / 4 = (2.210+2.411=4.621, 4.621+3.148=7.769, 7.769+4.086=11.855) -> 11.855/4 = 2.96375\n        hour16: (1.072 + 0.938 + 1.474 + 2.076) / 4 = (1.072+0.938=2.01, 2.01+1.474=3.484, 3.484+2.076=5.56) -> 5.56/4 = 1.39\n        hour17: (0.469 + 0.670 + 1.206 + 1.674) / 4 = (0.469+0.670=1.139, 1.139+1.206=2.345, 2.345+1.674=4.019) -> 4.019/4 = 1.00475\n        hour18: (0.268 + 0.134 + 0.670 -0.335) / 4 = (0.268+0.134=0.402, 0.402+0.670=1.072, 1.072-0.335=0.737) -> 0.737/4 = 0.18425\n        hour19: (0.067 + 0.067 + 0.402 -0.067) / 4 = (0.067+0.067=0.134, 0.134+0.402=0.536, 0.536-0.067=0.469) -> 0.469/4 = 0.11725\n        hour20: (0.000 + 0.067 + 0.469 + 0.000) / 4 = (0.000+0.067=0.067, 0.067+0.469=0.536, 0.536+0.000=0.536) -> 0.536/4 = 0.134\n        hour21: (0.804 + 0.134 -0.134 + 0.201) / 4 = (0.804+0.134=0.938, 0.938-0.134=0.804, 0.804+0.201=1.005) -> 1.005/4 = 0.25125\n        hour22: (0.938 -0.201 + 0.268 + 0.737) / 4 = (0.938-0.201=0.737, 0.737+0.268=1.005, 1.005+0.737=1.742) -> 1.742/4 = 0.4355\n        hour23: (1.005 + 0.804 + 1.407 + 0.938) / 4 = (1.005+0.804=1.809, 1.809+1.407=3.216, 3.216+0.938=4.154) -> 4.154/4 = 1.0385\n\n 23. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-18 23:00:00: \n            hour0: 1.5405\n            hour1: 1.89175\n            hour23: 1.0385\n\n        Day 2: 2017-06-19 00:00:00 to 2017-06-19 23:00:00: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2017-06-20 00:00:00 to 2017-06-20 23:00:00: same\n        Day 4: 2017-06-21 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00: same\n\n 24. But note: the dates must be generated as:\n        Start: 2017-06-18 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-06-18 01:00:00 ... until 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'\n\n 26. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 27. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        date                  HULL\n        2017-06-18 00:00:00  1.541   [rounded from 1.5405]\n        2017-06-18 01:00:00  1.892   [and so on]\n\n 28. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 29. We note: the average method might not be the most accurate, but with limited data and no clear trend, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 30. We output the data in the required format.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n We have the 24-hour pattern as a list (from hour0 to hour23) with the computed averages, then we repeat it 4 times.\n\n Pattern (rounded to 3 decimal places):\n\n  0: 1.5405 -> 1.541\n  1: 1.89175 -> 1.892\n  2: 2.09275 -> 2.093\n  3: 1.189 -> 1.189\n  4: 0.8875 -> 0.888\n  5: 1.07175 -> 1.072\n  6: 1.15575 -> 1.156\n  7: 1.9925 -> 1.992\n  8: 2.679 -> 2.679\n  9: 2.9805 -> 2.981\n  10: 3.7005 -> 3.701\n  11: 3.51625 -> 3.516\n  12: 4.3035 -> 4.304\n  13: 3.7005 -> 3.701\n  14: 4.2195 -> 4.220\n  15: 2.96375 -> 2.964\n  16: 1.39 -> 1.390\n  17: 1.00475 -> 1.005\n  18: 0.18425 -> 0.184\n  19: 0.11725 -> 0.117\n  20: 0.134 -> 0.134\n  21: 0.25125 -> 0.251\n  22: 0.4355 -> 0.436\n  23: 1.0385 -> 1.039\n\n 31. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-06-18 00:00:00\n      End: 2017-06-21 23:00:00\n\n 32. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-06-18 00:00:00  1.541\n2017-06-18 01:00:00  1.892\n...\n2017-06-21 23:00:00  1.039\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 33. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the generation:\n\n   dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-06-18 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n   values = pattern * 4   [pattern is the 24 numbers above, repeated 4 times]\n\n But note: the pattern is for hour0 to hour23, so we just repeat the list 4 times.\n\n 34. We output the data as:\n\n        date string in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 35. We write the data with the date and the value (rounded to 3 decimals) in the same format as the input.\n\n 36. We note: the original data had negative values? So we keep the rounding as is.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   pattern = [1.541, 1.892, 2.093, 1.189, 0.888, 1.072, 1.156, 1.992, 2.679, 2.981, 3.701, 3.516, \n              4.304, 3.701, 4.220, 2.964, 1.390, 1.005, 0.184, 0.117, 0.134, 0.251, 0.436, 1.039]\n\n   Then the values for the 4 days: \n        day1: pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n        day2: pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n        day3: pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n        day4: pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n\n 37. We generate the dates:\n\n        day1: 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-18 23:00:00\n        day2: 2017-06-19 00:00:00 to 2017-06-19 23:00:00\n        day3: 2017-06-20 00:00:00 to 2017-06-20 23:00:00\n        day4: 2017-06-21 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00\n\n 38. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 39. We output in the required format.\n\n Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-06-18 00:00:00  1.541\n        2017-06-18 01:00:00  1.892\n        2017-06-18 02:00:00  2.093\n        2017-06-18 03:00:00  1.189\n        ... until 2017-06-18 23:00:00: 1.039\n\n        Then 2017-06-19 00:00:00: 1.541\n        and so on.\n\n 40. We note: the last value of the last day (2017-06-21 23:00:00) will be 1.039.\n\n 41. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 42. We must not omit any.\n\n 43.
