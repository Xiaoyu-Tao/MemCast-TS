        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00 (4 days * 24 hours = 96 records).\n We are to forecast the next 96 recorded dates (i.e., the next 4 days, from 2016-08-22 00:00:00 to 2016-08-25 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input. Since the given data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we have 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data, we can observe:\n    - There is a daily pattern (e.g., values drop during certain hours and rise in others).\n    - The data does not show a clear long-term trend over the 4 days, but we have only 4 days.\n\n 4. Since the data is relatively short (only 4 days) and we need to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n    - Using a model that captures seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 (hourly data, daily seasonality).\n\n 5. We can use a simple seasonal model. One common approach is to use the seasonal naive method, where the forecast for a given hour is the value from the same hour in the previous day.\n\n    However, note that the data might have multiple seasonality or other patterns. But with only 4 days, complex models might not be feasible.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the available days. Since we have 4 days, we can take the average of each hour across the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the next 4 days might be similar to the previous 4 days? We don't have information about weekly seasonality (only 4 days, so no weekly pattern). So we can use the daily pattern.\n\n 7. Steps for the average method:\n    - Group the data by hour of the day (i.e., 0,1,...,23).\n    - For each hour, compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 8. However, note that the data might have a trend or other patterns. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture. Also, the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none.\n\n 9. We'll use the average method for simplicity and because it captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 10. How to compute:\n     - We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We can create a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours).\n     - Then, for each hour (column), compute the mean.\n\n 11. But note: the data starts at 2016-08-18 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-08-21 23:00:00. The next 96 hours will be from 2016-08-22 00:00:00 to 2016-08-25 23:00:00.\n\n 12. Let's extract the hour from the timestamp and then group by hour.\n\n 13. However, we must be cautious: the data might have anomalies? But we are to provide a forecast.\n\n 14. Implementation:\n\n     Step 1: Parse the given data into a DataFrame (if we were coding, but here we are reasoning).\n     Step 2: Extract the hour from the date.\n     Step 3: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n     Example for hour 0: \n        2016-08-18 00:00:00 -> 6.966\n        2016-08-19 00:00:00 -> 6.631\n        2016-08-20 00:00:00 -> 6.430\n        2016-08-21 00:00:00 -> 6.296\n        Average = (6.966 + 6.631 + 6.430 + 6.296) / 4 = 6.58075\n\n     Similarly for other hours.\n\n 15. Then, for the next 4 days, we will have 4 cycles of these 24 average values.\n\n 16. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided data there are none. So we can use the average.\n\n 17. However, if we had missing values in the input, we would have to impute them. But the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (6.966 + 6.631 + 6.430 + 6.296) / 4 = 6.58075\n     Hour 1: (8.172 + 6.095 + 6.229 + 6.966) / 4 = (8.172+6.095+6.229+6.966)/4 = 27.462/4 = 6.8655\n     Hour 2: (6.765+5.961+5.358+6.966)/4 = (6.765+5.961+5.358+6.966)=25.05/4=6.2625\n     Hour 3: (7.100+6.363+5.492+6.631)/4 = (7.100+6.363+5.492+6.631)=25.586/4=6.3965\n     Hour 4: (6.162+6.162+6.497+5.626)/4 = (6.162+6.162+6.497+5.626)=24.447/4=6.11175\n     Hour 5: (6.966+5.626+4.622+3.014)/4 = (6.966+5.626+4.622+3.014)=20.228/4=5.057\n     Hour 6: (7.234+5.157+6.430+4.086)/4 = (7.234+5.157+6.430+4.086)=22.907/4=5.72675\n     Hour 7: (7.033+7.770+6.765+4.823)/4 = (7.033+7.770+6.765+4.823)=26.391/4=6.59775\n     Hour 8: (6.095+5.693+7.636+4.354)/4 = (6.095+5.693+7.636+4.354)=23.778/4=5.9445\n     Hour 9: (6.631+5.224+7.435+3.081)/4 = (6.631+5.224+7.435+3.081)=22.371/4=5.59275\n     Hour 10: (5.827+5.827+6.832+5.157)/4 = (5.827+5.827+6.832+5.157)=23.643/4=5.91075\n     Hour 11: (5.894+6.430+5.559+4.823)/4 = (5.894+6.430+5.559+4.823)=22.706/4=5.6765\n     Hour 12: (6.028+5.693+4.421+4.421)/4 = (6.028+5.693+4.421+4.421)=20.563/4=5.14075\n     Hour 13: (5.894+4.689+4.555+4.421)/4 = (5.894+4.689+4.555+4.421)=19.559/4=4.88975\n     Hour 14: (5.760+4.153+4.019+4.153)/4 = (5.760+4.153+4.019+4.153)=18.085/4=4.52125\n     Hour 15: (6.564+5.492+4.421+4.756)/4 = (6.564+5.492+4.421+4.756)=21.233/4=5.30825\n     Hour 16: (5.559+5.559+3.751+3.952)/4 = (5.559+5.559+3.751+3.952)=18.821/4=4.70525\n     Hour 17: (5.626+5.358+4.086+3.818)/4 = (5.626+5.358+4.086+3.818)=18.888/4=4.722\n     Hour 18: (5.358+4.689+2.411+3.751)/4 = (5.358+4.689+2.411+3.751)=16.209/4=4.05225\n     Hour 19: (4.488+4.756+2.545+3.684)/4 = (4.488+4.756+2.545+3.684)=15.473/4=3.86825\n     Hour 20: (4.421+4.488+3.215+4.488)/4 = (4.421+4.488+3.215+4.488)=16.612/4=4.153\n     Hour 21: (4.689+4.153+4.555+4.086)/4 = (4.689+4.153+4.555+4.086)=17.483/4=4.37075\n     Hour 22: (6.631+8.573+5.827+3.818)/4 = (6.631+8.573+5.827+3.818)=24.849/4=6.21225\n     Hour 23: (6.497+6.966+7.167+5.023)/4 = (6.497+6.966+7.167+5.023)=25.653/4=6.41325\n\n 19. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating these 24 average values for 4 days.\n\n 20. The next 96 hours start at 2016-08-22 00:00:00 and go to 2016-08-25 23:00:00.\n\n 21. We'll output the data in the same format: one row per hour, with the date and the forecasted HULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 22. Format:\n\n        date                HULL\n        2016-08-22 00:00:00 [value for hour0]\n        2016-08-22 01:00:00 [value for hour1]\n        ...\n        2016-08-22 23:00:00 [value for hour23]\n        2016-08-23 00:00:00 [value for hour0]   # same as the first day\n        ... until 2016-08-25 23:00:00\n\n 23. We'll round the forecasted values to 3 decimal places.\n\n 24. Let's note: the input data has 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 25. We must be cautious: the average we computed might have more than 3 decimal places, so we round to 3.\n\n 26. Now, we generate the next 96 records.\n\n 27. The dates: \n      Day 1: 2016-08-22\n      Day 2: 2016-08-23\n      Day 3: 2016-08-24\n      Day 4: 2016-08-25\n\n 28. For each day, we output 24 hours.\n\n 29. The hour0 for each day: 6.581 (rounded from 6.58075 -> 6.581)\n     Hour1: 6.866 (from 6.8655 -> 6.866) -> but note: 6.8655 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 6.866\n\n 30. We'll round each average value to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n     Hour0: 6.58075 -> 6.581\n     Hour1: 6.8655 -> 6.866\n     Hour2: 6.2625 -> 6.263\n     Hour3: 6.3965 -> 6.397\n     Hour4: 6.11175 -> 6.112\n     Hour5: 5.057 -> 5.057\n     Hour6: 5.72675 -> 5.727\n     Hour7: 6.59775 -> 6.598\n     Hour8: 5.9445 -> 5.945\n     Hour9: 5.59275 -> 5.593\n     Hour10: 5.91075 -> 5.911\n     Hour11: 5.6765 -> 5.677\n     Hour12: 5.14075 -> 5.141\n     Hour13: 4.88975 -> 4.890\n     Hour14: 4.52125 -> 4.521\n     Hour15: 5.30825 -> 5.308\n     Hour16: 4.70525 -> 4.705\n     Hour17: 4.722 -> 4.722\n     Hour18: 4.05225 -> 4.052\n     Hour19: 3.86825 -> 3.868\n     Hour20: 4.153 -> 4.153\n     Hour21: 4.37075 -> 4.371\n     Hour22: 6.21225 -> 6.212\n     Hour23: 6.41325 -> 6.413\n\n 32. Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n     Day1: 2016-08-22\n        00:00:00 -> 6.581\n        01:00:00 -> 6.866\n        02:00:00 -> 6.263\n        03:00:00 -> 6.397\n        04:00:00 -> 6.112\n        05:00:00 -> 5.057\n        06:00:00 -> 5.727\n        07:00:00 -> 6.598\n        08:00:00 -> 5.945\n        09:00:00 -> 5.593\n        10:00:00 -> 5.911\n        11:00:00 -> 5.677\n        12:00:00 -> 5.141\n        13:00:00 -> 4.890\n        14:00:00 -> 4.521\n        15:00:00 -> 5.308\n        16:00:00 -> 4.705\n        17:00:00 -> 4.722\n        18:00:00 -> 4.052\n        19:00:00 -> 3.868\n        20:00:00 -> 4.153\n        21:00:00 -> 4.371\n        22:00:00 -> 6.212\n        23:00:00 -> 6.413\n\n     Day2: 2016-08-23: same 24 values as above.\n\n     Day3: 2016-08-24: same.\n\n     Day4: 2016-08-25: same.\n\n 33. We output 96 rows.\n\n 34. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate                HULL\n2016-08-22 00:00:00 6.581\n2016-08-22 01:00:00 6.866\n... (all 96 rows)\n2016-08-25 23:00:00 6.413\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 35. We must be cautious: the last provided date was 2016-08-21 23:00:00, so the next date is 2016-08-22 00:00:00.\n\n 36. Let's generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-08-22 00:00:00\n      Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-08-25 23:00:00.\n\n 37. We'll write the 96 rows accordingly.\n\n 38. We are to output the complete data without any omission.\n\n 39. We'll generate the data in the answer block.\n\n 40. Note: The problem says to be aware of missing values, but we are forecasting and the input we have is complete. We are generating a complete set of 96 forecasts.\n\n 41. We are using a simple average method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, etc.), but with only 4 days of data, it's hard to fit such models.
