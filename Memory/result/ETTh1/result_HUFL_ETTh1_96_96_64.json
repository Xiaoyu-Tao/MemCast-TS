        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 records is complete.\n 2. We must generate 96 forecasted values for the next 96 hours.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours each day),\n we can use a time series model that captures seasonality. Given the hourly data, the seasonality period is 24.\n\n However, note that the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history for training a complex model.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can use a simple model such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: where the forecast for a given hour is the value from the same hour of the previous day.\n   - But note: we have 4 days of data, so we can average the same hour over the available days? Or use the last available same hour.\n\n But the data shows some trend? Let's check:\n\n   The data from 2017-03-14 to 2017-03-17:\n     - The values at 00:00: 11.922, 15.338, 11.320, 12.726 -> not stable, so averaging might be better.\n\n However, we are only allowed to use the provided 96 points.\n\n Another idea: use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to forecast 96 points, we can use a simple seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component.\n\n But note: the data has missing values in general? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided past 96 are complete. \n So for the past data we have no missing values. For the forecast, we must provide 96 values without any omission.\n\n Since we are not given any other variables (like oil temperature) and only HUFL, we focus on univariate forecasting.\n\n Considering the above, we can use:\n   - A model: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with additive or multiplicative seasonality.\n\n However, with only 4 days (one season of 24 hours, and 4 seasons) we have very limited data. But we can try.\n\n Steps for Holt-Winters:\n   - We have to choose between additive and multiplicative. Looking at the data, the variation in the seasonal component seems to have a consistent amplitude? \n     Let's see: \n        Day 1: min -12.190, max 12.726 -> range ~25\n        Day 2: min -7.837, max 15.606 -> range ~23.4\n        Day 3: min -10.784, max 11.855 -> range ~22.6\n        Day 4: min -2.143, max 12.726 -> range ~14.9\n\n     The range is not constant, but not dramatically changing. We can try additive.\n\n   - We'll use the last 96 points to fit the model and then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n But note: the model might not be stable with only 4 seasons. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n However, let's check for trend: \n   The overall level of the first day (2017-03-14) and the last day (2017-03-17) doesn't show a clear increasing or decreasing trend.\n\n   We can compute the average per day:\n      Day1: average of 24 hours: \n        (11.922+12.726+...+10.047)/24 -> we don't need exact, but roughly: \n        The values go from about -12 to 12 -> average might be around 0? \n\n   Actually, let me compute the mean for each day:\n\n   Day1 (2017-03-14): \n        mean = (11.922+12.726+11.454+10.181+11.387+10.114+9.377+10.516+4.957-2.612-6.162-7.569-12.190-10.047-8.841-6.564-3.014+3.550+7.234+7.837+7.904+8.506+9.511+10.047) / 24 \n        = (let me calculate roughly: positive part: 11.922+12.726+11.454+10.181+11.387+10.114+9.377+10.516+4.957+3.550+7.234+7.837+7.904+8.506+9.511+10.047) \n          = 146.122\n        negative part: -2.612-6.162-7.569-12.190-10.047-8.841-6.564-3.014 = -57.0\n        total = 146.122 - 57.0 = 89.122 -> mean = 89.122/24 = 3.713\n\n   Day2: \n        15.338+14.736+15.606+12.927+12.927+13.396+10.516+13.463+7.837+4.287-4.689-7.837-4.756-2.344-3.818+3.952+6.229+8.573+7.167+7.770+7.167+7.837+7.703+9.578\n        positive: 15.338+14.736+15.606+12.927+12.927+13.396+10.516+13.463+7.837+4.287+3.952+6.229+8.573+7.167+7.770+7.167+7.837+7.703+9.578 = 175.8\n        negative: -4.689-7.837-4.756-2.344-3.818 = -23.444\n        total = 175.8 - 23.444 = 152.356 -> mean = 152.356/24 = 6.348\n\n   Day3: \n        11.320+11.588+10.516+9.176+11.186+9.980+11.855+11.186+8.975+4.756-0.737+3.483-10.784-6.028-7.569-4.555+0.000+6.363+6.832+8.038+7.301+7.100+6.832+9.176\n        positive: 11.320+11.588+10.516+9.176+11.186+9.980+11.855+11.186+8.975+4.756+3.483+6.363+6.832+8.038+7.301+7.100+6.832+9.176 = 155.663\n        negative: -0.737-10.784-6.028-7.569-4.555 = -29.673\n        total = 155.663 - 29.673 = 125.99 -> mean = 125.99/24 = 5.25\n\n   Day4:\n        12.726+12.726+11.788+9.645+8.908+10.583+10.516+12.056+8.908+4.019+1.139+1.005-2.143-0.603+2.478+3.550+3.952+7.569+7.502+7.569+7.167+8.239+8.975+11.119\n        positive: 12.726+12.726+11.788+9.645+8.908+10.583+10.516+12.056+8.908+4.019+1.139+1.005+2.478+3.550+3.952+7.569+7.502+7.569+7.167+8.239+8.975+11.119 = 161.72\n        negative: -2.143-0.603 = -2.746\n        total = 161.72 - 2.746 = 158.974 -> mean = 158.974/24 = 6.624\n\n   The daily means: 3.713, 6.348, 5.25, 6.624 -> no clear trend? \n\n   So we can use a seasonal naive method: using the last day (2017-03-17) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n   But note: the problem says the data has missing values in general, but the provided past 96 are complete. So we are only using the provided 96.\n\n   However, the last day (2017-03-17) has a mean of 6.624, and the previous days are 3.713, 6.348, 5.25. \n   We don't see a clear pattern. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a typical day, and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n   Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 00: (11.922 + 15.338 + 11.320 + 12.726) / 4 = (11.922+15.338=27.26; 27.26+11.320=38.58; 38.58+12.726=51.306) -> 51.306/4 = 12.8265\n   Hour 01: (12.726+14.736+11.588+12.726) /4 = (12.726+14.736=27.462; 27.462+11.588=39.05; 39.05+12.726=51.776) -> 12.944\n   ... and so on.\n\n   Then we would have 24 average values. We then repeat these 24 values for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are only to forecast the next 96, and we are given complete past 96.\n\n   However, this method ignores any trend and recent changes. \n\n   Another idea: use the last day (2017-03-17) as the base and adjust by the overall level? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n   Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have very limited data, we choose the average by hour method.\n\n   Steps:\n     - Group the data by hour of the day (00,01,...,23) and compute the mean for each hour over the 4 days.\n     - Then for the next 96 hours (4 days: 2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21), we assign the mean for hour 00 to 00:00 of each day, hour 01 to 01:00, etc.\n\n   But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to know. And the 4 days are consecutive? They are from Tuesday to Friday? \n   Then the next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? But we don't have data for weekend. \n\n   However, the problem does not specify any weekly seasonality and we only have 4 days.
