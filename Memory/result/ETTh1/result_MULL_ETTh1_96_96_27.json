        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be prepared to handle missing values in the forecasting process.\n\n 2. Since the data is time series with hourly frequency, we can consider using time series forecasting methods. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days ahead, we might use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (ETS)\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components.\n\n 3. Observing the data: \n    - There is a clear daily seasonality (24 hours cycle). For example, the load drops during certain hours and peaks at others.\n    - The data also shows some level of non-stationarity (varying mean and variance).\n\n 4. Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model or Exponential Smoothing State Space Model with seasonality (ETS with seasonality).\n\n 5. However, note that we only have 4 days of data (96 points). This is a very short series for fitting a model with multiple parameters. We must be cautious.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.\n    - Extrapolate the trend (if any) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 7. But note: the data might have missing values in the future? The user says the data will have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. \n    We are only given the past 96 without missing values. We are to forecast the next 96 without missing values? The instruction says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\".\n\n 8. Approach:\n    - We will use a model that can handle the seasonality and the short history.\n    - We choose to use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the short data, we can use:\n    - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) which is designed for data with trend and seasonality.\n\n 10. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Check for missing values in the provided data and impute if necessary (but the provided 96 are complete).\n     - Set the frequency to 24 (since it's hourly and daily seasonality).\n     - Fit a Holt-Winters model (or ETS model with additive or multiplicative seasonality). We can try both and see which fits better, but we don't have a test set.\n\n 11. However, we are not coding but providing a forecast. We must use our expertise to generate the next 96 points.\n\n 12. But note: we cannot run code here. We must simulate the forecast.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the available days and adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 14. Let's break down the problem:\n\n     We have 4 days of data. We can compute the daily pattern by averaging each hour across the 4 days.\n\n     However, there might be a trend? Let's check the overall daily average:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-10-17): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2 (2016-10-18): average = ...\n        Day 3 (2016-10-19): ...\n        Day 4 (2016-10-20): ...\n\n     Then we can compute the trend of the daily averages and project it for the next 4 days.\n\n     Then for each hour in the next 4 days, we take the average of that hour from the past 4 days and adjust by the projected daily average.\n\n 15. Steps for manual forecast:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the average for each day (over 24 hours) for the 4 days.\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-17: \n            values: [4.158, 3.660, 3.198, 3.625, 3.198, 3.838, 3.198, 3.020, 2.594, 1.599, 1.599, 1.990, 0.746, 0.746, 1.706, 1.386, 1.173, 0.995, 0.817, 0.959, 1.031, 0.533, 0.853, 1.386]\n            average1 = (sum of these)/24\n\n        Similarly for Day2, Day3, Day4.\n\n     Step 2: Compute the daily averages:\n\n        Let me calculate:\n\n        Day1: \n            sum = 4.158+3.660+3.198+3.625+3.198+3.838+3.198+3.020+2.594+1.599+1.599+1.990+0.746+0.746+1.706+1.386+1.173+0.995+0.817+0.959+1.031+0.533+0.853+1.386\n            = 52.337\n            average1 = 52.337 / 24 = 2.1807\n\n        Day2: \n            [2.274,2.665,2.416,2.274,2.843,2.487,1.741,1.954,1.492,1.528,1.421,1.564,0.711,0.675,1.599,1.457,0.782,0.355,0.888,0.853,0.853,0.178,2.665,3.447]\n            sum = 2.274+2.665+2.416+2.274+2.843+2.487+1.741+1.954+1.492+1.528+1.421+1.564+0.711+0.675+1.599+1.457+0.782+0.355+0.888+0.853+0.853+0.178+2.665+3.447\n            = 41.223\n            average2 = 41.223 / 24 = 1.7176\n\n        Day3:\n            [4.015,3.802,4.300,3.909,2.985,3.411,3.873,3.625,3.092,1.137,1.564,2.239,0.959,1.102,2.132,2.559,1.954,1.421,1.066,0.853,0.853,0.924,1.741,2.132]\n            sum = 4.015+3.802+4.300+3.909+2.985+3.411+3.873+3.625+3.092+1.137+1.564+2.239+0.959+1.102+2.132+2.559+1.954+1.421+1.066+0.853+0.853+0.924+1.741+2.132\n            = 55.144\n            average3 = 55.144 / 24 = 2.2977\n\n        Day4:\n            [1.919,2.274,3.092,2.168,1.777,1.102,1.812,1.990,2.239,1.777,1.244,1.954,0.853,0.711,1.777,1.457,1.812,0.995,0.853,0.569,0.426,1.102,2.559,3.163]\n            sum = 1.919+2.274+3.092+2.168+1.777+1.102+1.812+1.990+2.239+1.777+1.244+1.954+0.853+0.711+1.777+1.457+1.812+0.995+0.853+0.569+0.426+1.102+2.559+3.163\n            = 40.000\n            average4 = 40.000 / 24 = 1.6667\n\n        The daily averages: [2.1807, 1.7176, 2.2977, 1.6667]\n\n        We see a fluctuation but no clear trend? It's only 4 points. We might consider the average of these daily averages as the base for the next days? Or use a moving average.\n\n     Step 3: We can compute the hourly profile by averaging the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): [4.158, 2.274, 4.015, 1.919] -> average = (4.158+2.274+4.015+1.919)/4 = 12.366/4 = 3.0915\n        For hour 1 (01:00): [3.660, 2.665, 3.802, 2.274] -> (3.660+2.665+3.802+2.274)/4 = 12.401/4 = 3.10025\n        ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n     Step 4: But we want to forecast 4 days. We can use the same hourly profile for each of the next 4 days? \n\n        However, note that the daily average of the next 4 days is unknown. We can take the average of the past 4 daily averages as the base for the next days? \n\n        Let overall_daily_avg = (2.1807 + 1.7176 + 2.2977 + 1.6667) / 4 = 7.8627 / 4 = 1.9657\n\n        Then for each day in the next 4 days, we set the daily average to 1.9657? But that ignores any trend.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last daily average (1.6667) and assume it continues? Or use a simple average.\n\n     Step 5: We can adjust the hourly profile so that the daily average of the forecasted day equals the overall_daily_avg (1.9657). \n\n        But note: the hourly profile we computed (by averaging the 4 days) has its own daily average? Actually, if we take the average of the 24 hourly averages, we get:\n\n            (3.0915 + 3.10025 + ... ) / 24 = ?\n\n        Actually, the average of the hourly averages is the same as the average of all the data? \n\n        Total of all 96 data points = 52.337 + 41.223 + 55.144 + 40.000 = 188.704\n        Overall average = 188.704 / 96 = 1.9657\n\n        So the average of the 24 hourly averages (if we compute them) will be 1.9657.\n\n        Therefore, if we use the hourly profile as is, then each forecasted day will have an average of 1.9657.\n\n     Step 6: So the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is simply the hourly profile (computed from the 4 days) repeated 4 days.\n\n     Step 7: But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to establish a trend. So we assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n     Step 8: Compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (4.158 + 2.274 + 4.015 + 1.919) / 4 = 3.0915\n        hour1: (3.660 + 2.665 + 3.802 + 2.274) / 4 = 3.10025\n        hour2: (3.198 + 2.416 + 4.300 + 3.092) / 4 = 3.2515\n        hour3: (3.625 + 2.274 + 3.909 + 2.168) / 4 = 2.994\n        hour4: (3.198 + 2.843 + 2.985 + 1.777) / 4 = 2.70075\n        hour5: (3.838 + 2.487 + 3.411 + 1.102) / 4 = 2.7095\n        hour6: (3.198 + 1.741 + 3.873 + 1.812) / 4 = 2.656\n        hour7: (3.020 + 1.954 + 3.625 + 1.990) / 4 = 2.64725\n        hour8: (2.594 + 1.492 + 3.092 + 2.239) / 4 = 2.35425\n        hour9: (1.599 + 1.528 + 1.137 + 1.777) / 4 = 1.51025\n        hour10: (1.599 + 1.421 + 1.564 + 1.244) / 4 = 1.457\n        hour11: (1.990 + 1.564 + 2.239 + 1.954) / 4 = 1.93675\n        hour12: (0.746 + 0.711 + 0.959 + 0.853) / 4 = 0.81725\n        hour13: (0.746 + 0.675 + 1.102 + 0.711) / 4 = 0.8085\n        hour14: (1.706 + 1.599 + 2.132 + 1.777) / 4 = 1.8035\n        hour15: (1.386 + 1.457 + 2.559 + 1.457) / 4 = 1.71475\n        hour16: (1.173 + 0.782 + 1.954 + 1.812) / 4 = 1.43025\n        hour17: (0.995 + 0.355 + 1.421 + 0.995) / 4 = 0.9415\n        hour18: (0.817 + 0.888 + 1.066 + 0.853) / 4 = 0.906\n        hour19: (0.959 + 0.853 + 0.853 + 0.569) / 4 = 0.8085\n        hour20: (1.031 + 0.853 + 0.853 + 0.426) / 4 = 0.79075\n        hour21: (0.533 + 0.178 + 0.924 + 1.102) / 4 = 0.68425\n        hour22: (0.853 + 2.665 + 1.741 + 2.559) / 4 = 1.9545\n        hour23: (1.386 + 3.447 + 2.132 + 3.163) / 4 = 2.532\n\n     Step 9: Now, we will repeat this pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours). The next day starts at 2016-10-21 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n\n     Step 10: Format the answer: \n        We must output 96 lines, starting from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00, with the MULL values as the computed hourly averages in order.\n\n     However, note: the user might expect a more sophisticated forecast? But with only 4 days, it's hard to do more.\n\n 16. But wait: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data (only 4 days, not even a week). So we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 17. Given the constraints, we go with the above.\n\n 18. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-21\n          00:00:00 -> 3.0915\n          01:00:00 -> 3.10025\n          02:00:00 -> 3.2515\n          03:00:00 -> 2.994\n          04:00:00 -> 2.70075\n          05:00:00 -> 2.7095\n          06:00:00 -> 2.656\n          07:00:00 -> 2.64725\n          08:00:00 -> 2.35425\n          09:00:00 -> 1.51025\n          10:00:00 -> 1.457\n          11:00:00 -> 1.93675\n          12:00:00 -> 0.81725\n          13:00:00 -> 0.8085\n          14:00:00 -> 1.8035\n          15:00:00 -> 1.71475\n          16:00:00 -> 1.43025\n          17:00:00 -> 0.9415\n          18:00:00 -> 0.906\n          19:00:00 -> 0.8085\n          20:00:00 -> 0.79075\n          21:00:00 -> 0.68425\n          22:00:00 -> 1.9545\n          23:00:00 -> 2.532\n\n        Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 19. But note: the dates must be continuous. The last given date is 2016-10-20 23:00:00, so the next is:\n\n        2016-10-21 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-21 23:00:00\n        2016-10-22 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-22 23:00:00\n        2016-10-23 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-23 23:00:00\n        2016-10-24 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-24 23:00:00\n\n 20. We output 96 lines.\n\n 21. We must round the numbers? The original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 22. Let's compute the hourly averages rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 3.092\n        hour1: 3.100\n        hour2: 3.252\n        hour3: 2.994\n        hour4: 2.701\n        hour5: 2.710\n        hour6: 2.656\n        hour7: 2.647\n        hour8: 2.354\n        hour9: 1.510\n        hour10: 1.457\n        hour11: 1.937\n        hour12: 0.817\n        hour13: 0.809\n        hour14: 1.804\n        hour15: 1.715\n        hour16: 1.430\n        hour17: 0.942\n        hour18: 0.906\n        hour19: 0.809\n        hour20: 0.791\n        hour21: 0.684\n        hour22: 1.955\n        hour23: 2.532\n\n 23. Now, we write the next 96 points by repeating this list 4 times.\n\n 24. However, note: the pattern might change slightly day to day? But we have no information to adjust. So we repeat.\n\n 25. But wait: the last day (2016-10-20) had a lower daily average? We are using the average of 4 days, so it's smoothed.\n\n 26. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 27. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-21 00:00:00 3.092\n2016-10-21 01:00:00 3.100\n2016-10-21 02:00:00 3.252\n2016-10-21 03:00:00 2.994\n2016-10-21 04:00:00 2.701\n2016-10-21 05:00:00 2.710\n2016-10-21 06:00:00 2.656\n2016-10-21 07:00:00 2.647\n2016-10-21 08:00:00 2.354\n2016-10-21 09:00:00 1.510\n2016-10-21 10:00:00 1.457\n2016-10-21 11:00:00 1.937\n2016-10-21 12:00:00 0.817\n2016-10-21 13:00:00 0.809\n2016-10-21 14:00:00 1.804\n2016-10-21 15:00:00 1.715\n2016-10-21 16:00:00 1.430\n2016-10-21 17:00:00 0.942\n2016-10-21 18:00:00 0.906\n2016-10-21 19:00:00 0.809\n2016-10-21 20:00:00 0.791\n2016-10-21 21:00:00 0.684\n2016-10-21 22:00:00 1.955\n2016-10-21 23:00:00 2.532\n2016-10-22 00:00:00 3.092\n2016-10-22 01:00:00 3.100\n... and so on until 2016-10-24 23:00:00\n\n```\n\n 28. We must write all 96 lines.\n\n 29. However, note: the user might have expected a different method? But with the given data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 30. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 31. Let's generate the entire 96 points:\n\n        We have 24 values for one day, and 4 days -> 96.\n\n        We'll write the 24 values for the first day (2016-10-21), then the same 24 for 2016-10-22, then 2016-10-23, then 2016-10-24.\n\n 32.
