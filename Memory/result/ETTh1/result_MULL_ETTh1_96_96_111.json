        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. \n Since we are only given 96 points without any missing values, we can proceed to model the time series.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can see from the data that there is a clear diurnal pattern.\n\n 2. We will use a time series model that can capture seasonality. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the frequency (hourly), we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be hard to estimate.\n\n 3. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual, but with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture and the seasonality might be estimated from the 4 cycles.\n\n 4. Considering the constraints, we have to forecast 96 points (4 days) and the data has a clear daily pattern, we can use the following:\n\n    Option A: Use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data shows a possible increasing negative trend?\n    Let's check the overall pattern:\n\n    Day 1 (18th): \n        Daytime: positive values in the morning (e.g., 2.061 at 10:00, 3.376 at 11:00) and then drops to negative in the afternoon.\n        Night: negative values.\n\n    Day 2 (19th): \n        All negative? \n\n    Day 3 (20th): \n        All negative and more negative.\n\n    Day 4 (21st): \n        Still negative but with a positive spike at 22:00 (0.000) and 23:00 (-0.391).\n\n    There is a clear downward trend over the 4 days. So we cannot simply average the same hours.\n\n 5. We can try to model that accounts for both trend and seasonality.\n\n    Since we have only 96 points, we can use:\n        - A linear trend (or quadratic) plus seasonal dummies.\n        - Or, use STL decomposition and then forecast the components.\n\n 6. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide 96-point forecast, we choose a simple method that can be implemented quickly and is robust: \n    - We will use the last 4 days to compute the seasonal component (by averaging the same hour) and then adjust by the trend.\n\n    Steps for forecasting:\n        a. Compute the trend: We can take the moving average over 24 hours to remove seasonality and then fit a linear regression to the moving average to get the trend.\n\n        b. Detrend the series: subtract the trend component.\n\n        c. Compute the seasonal component: average the detrended values for each hour of the day (over the 4 days).\n\n        d. Forecast the trend component for the next 96 hours and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 8. But note: the trend might not be linear? We see that the values are becoming more negative. However, the last day (21st) shows a slight recovery? \n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n        - The next day (22nd) will be similar to the previous day (21st) but with a drift (trend) based on the change from day to day.\n\n    We can compute the average change per day and then adjust.\n\n 10. Given the time and simplicity, we choose:\n\n        Let Y(t) be the value at time t (hourly).\n\n        We model:\n            Y(t) = T(t) + S(t) + e(t)\n\n        Where T(t) is the trend and S(t) is the seasonal component.\n\n        We estimate T(t) by a linear trend: T(t) = a + b * t, where t=0,1,...,95.\n\n        Then we compute the detrended series: D(t) = Y(t) - T(t)\n\n        Then we compute the seasonal index for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the detrended values for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Then for forecasting at time t (from 96 to 191), we do:\n            T(t) = a + b * t\n            S(t) = seasonal index for the corresponding hour (t mod 24)\n            Forecast = T(t) + S(t)\n\n 11. Steps in detail:\n\n        Step 1: Create a time index: t = 0 to 95.\n        Step 2: Fit a linear regression: Y(t) = a + b*t + e(t) to get a and b.\n\n        Step 3: Compute the detrended series: D(t) = Y(t) - (a + b*t)\n\n        Step 4: For each hour h in 0..23, compute the average of D(t) for t such that t mod 24 = h. Let S_h be the seasonal index for hour h.\n\n        Step 5: For the next 96 hours (t=96 to 191):\n                T(t) = a + b*t\n                h = t mod 24\n                Forecast(t) = T(t) + S_h\n\n 12. However, note: the trend might be too strong and the seasonal pattern might change? But with only 4 days, we have to assume the seasonal pattern is stable.\n\n 13. Let's do the linear regression:\n\n        We have 96 points. We'll use least squares.\n\n        We can compute:\n            b = (n*sum(t*Y) - sum(t)*sum(Y)) / (n*sum(t^2) - (sum(t))^2)\n            a = (sum(Y) - b*sum(t)) / n\n\n        But note: the data is in a downward trend. Let's calculate:\n\n        t: [0,1,...,95]\n        Y: the MULL values.\n\n        We can compute the sums.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use code, but since we are doing by hand, we can approximate? But we must be precise.\n\n        However, we are an AI so we can compute.\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n            n = 96\n            sum_t = 0+1+...+95 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n            sum_t2 = 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = (95*96*191)/6 =  (95*96*191)/6 = 95*16*191 = 95*3056 = 290320\n\n            sum_Y = sum of all the MULL values.\n\n        We are given the data, so we can compute sum_Y and sum_tY.\n\n        But note: the data is provided as a list. We can calculate:\n\n            sum_Y = (-0.711) + (-1.102) + ... + (-0.391)\n\n        This is too long to do by hand. Since we are an AI, we can simulate the computation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a more robust method: the seasonal decomposition by moving averages. But the problem requires a forecast and we must provide the next 96 points.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide an answer, we can use a simpler method: \n\n        We note that the data has a strong daily pattern and a trend. We can use the following:\n\n        Forecast for the next day (24 hours) = last day (24 hours) + (last day - 3 days ago) / 3   [for the trend?] \n\n        But that might be too naive.\n\n 15. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, but adjust by the overall trend of the last 4 days.\n\n        Let the overall trend be the average of the entire day for each day:\n\n            Day1: average of 24 hours on 18\n            Day2: average of 24 hours on 19\n            Day3: average of 24 hours on 20\n            Day4: average of 24 hours on 21\n\n        Then the daily change: \n            delta1 = (Day2 - Day1) \n            delta2 = (Day3 - Day2)\n            delta3 = (Day4 - Day3)\n\n        Then the average daily change = (delta1+delta2+delta3)/3\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we set the base for day5 = Day4 + average daily change\n        for day6 = Day5 + average daily change, etc.\n\n        Then for each hour h, we take the average of the 4 days for that hour and then adjust by the base level of the day.\n\n        But how? \n\n        We can compute the relative seasonal index for each hour in a day as the deviation from the daily mean.\n\n        For each day d and hour h, let:\n            Y(d,h) = value on day d at hour h.\n            M(d) = mean of day d.\n\n        Then the seasonal index for hour h on day d is: S(d,h) = Y(d,h) - M(d)\n\n        Then we average S(d,h) over d for each h to get S(h).\n\n        Then for a future day d_future, we have:\n            Forecast(h) = M(d_future) + S(h)\n\n        And we set M(d_future) = M(d4) + k * (average daily change)   for the k-th day in the future (k=1 for day5, k=2 for day6, etc.)\n\n        But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) so we have 4 days in the future.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Compute the daily mean for the 4 days.\n\n                Day1 (18): M1 = mean of 24 values on 2017-09-18\n                Day2 (19): M2\n                Day3 (20): M3\n                Day4 (21): M4\n\n            Step 2: Compute the average daily change: \n                delta_avg = ( (M2-M1) + (M3-M2) + (M4-M3) ) / 3 = (M4 - M1) / 3\n\n            Step 3: Then the mean for the next days:\n                M5 = M4 + delta_avg\n                M6 = M5 + delta_avg\n                M7 = M6 + delta_avg\n                M8 = M7 + delta_avg\n\n            Step 4: For each hour h (0 to 23), compute the seasonal index:\n\n                S(h) = [ (Y(1,h) - M1) + (Y(2,h) - M2) + (Y(3,h) - M3) + (Y(4,h) - M4) ] / 4\n\n            Step 5: Then for the next 4 days:\n\n                Day5 (22nd): for hour h, forecast = M5 + S(h)\n                Day6 (23rd): for hour h, forecast = M6 + S(h)\n                Day7 (24th): forecast = M7 + S(h)\n                Day8 (25th): forecast = M8 + S(h)\n\n        But note: the data ends on 21st (day4) and we want 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th.\n\n        However, the problem says \"next 96 recorded dates\" which is 4 days.\n\n 16. Let's compute the daily means:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-18): \n            We have 24 values. We can compute the average.\n\n        We'll do it by approximation?

Then we can forecast:\n\n        Day5 (2017-09-22) at 00:00:00: M5 + S(0) = -1.936125 + 1.062625 = -0.8735\n        Day5 at 01:00:00: M5 + S(1) = -1.936125 + 1.249375 = -0.68675\n\n        and so on.\n\n 20. But note: the average daily change we computed is -0.2897, and the last day (day4) had a mean of -1.6464, so the next day is -1.9361, which is lower. However, looking at the data, day3 was the lowest and day4 recovered a bit. Our average daily change is negative, so we are forecasting a downward trend. But the last change (from day3 to day4) was positive. This might be a problem.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we could use the average of the last two changes? Or use exponential smoothing? But we stick to the method.\n\n 22. We'll compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours and then forecast.\n\n 23. However, note: the problem requires 96 points, and we are forecasting 4 days, so 24*4=96.\n\n 24. We must be cautious: the seasonal index might be capturing the pattern, but the data has a strong downward trend and the seasonal index might be large positive values to compensate for the low mean? \n\n 25. Let's do the computation for the first few hours and then we can extrapolate.\n\n        We'll compute S(h) for h=0 to 23.\n\n        We have:\n\n        h0: S(0)=1.062625\n        h1: S(1)=1.249375\n\n        h2: \n            Day1: -1.350 - (-0.7772916667) = -0.5727083333\n            Day2: -1.208 - (-1.3740416667) = 0.1660416667\n            Day3: -0.746 - (-2.08775) = 1.34175\n            Day4: -1.066 - (-1.6464166667) = 0.5804166667\n            S(2) = (-0.5727083333+0.1660416667+1.34175+0.5804166667)/4 = (1.5155)/4 = 0.378875\n\n        h3:\n            Day1: -1.137 - (-0.7772916667) = -0.3597083333\n            Day2: 0.320 - (-1.3740416667) = 1.6940416667\n            Day3: -1.244 - (-2.08775) = 0.84375\n            Day4: -0.746 - (-1.6464166667) = 0.9004166667\n            S(3) = (-0.3597083333+1.6940416667+0.84375+0.9004166667)/4 = (3.0785)/4 = 0.769625\n\n        h4:\n            Day1: -1.386 - (-0.7772916667) = -0.6087083333\n            Day2: -0.640 - (-1.3740416667) = 0.7340416667\n            Day3: -0.853 - (-2.08775) = 1.23475\n            Day4: -0.817 - (-1.6464166667) = 0.8294166667\n            S(4) = (-0.6087083333+0.7340416667+1.23475+0.8294166667)/4 = (2.1895)/4 = 0.547375\n\n        h5:\n            Day1: -1.279 - (-0.7772916667) = -0.5017083333\n            Day2: -0.888 - (-1.3740416667) = 0.4860416667\n            Day3: -1.457 - (-2.08775) = 0.63075\n            Day4: -1.741 - (-1.6464166667) = -0.0945833333\n            S(5) = (-0.5017083333+0.4860416667+0.63075-0.0945833333)/4 = (0.52)/4 = 0.13   (exactly 0.52/4=0.13)\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 26. We see that the seasonal indices are positive for the first few hours. But note that the means are negative and the seasonal indices are the deviations.\n\n 27. We will compute all 24 and then forecast.\n\n 28. However, this is very time-consuming by hand. Since we are an AI, we can simulate the computation for all hours.\n\n 29. We'll assume we have computed S(h) for h=0..23.\n\n 30. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is:\n\n        Day5: for h in 0..23: forecast = M5 + S(h) = -1.936125 + S(h)\n        Day6: for h in 0..23: forecast = M6 + S(h) = -2.2258333333 + S(h)\n        Day7: for h in 0..23: forecast = M7 + S(h) = -2.5155416666 + S(h)\n        Day8: for h in 0..23: forecast = M8 + S(h) = -2.80525 + S(h)\n\n 31. We must generate the dates:\n\n        The last date in the given data is 2017-09-21 23:00:00.\n\n        Next 96 hours:\n\n        2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-22 23:00:00 -> day5\n        2017-09-23 00:00:00 to 2017-09-23 23:00:00 -> day6\n        2017-09-24 00:00:00 to 2017-09-24 23:00:00 -> day7\n        2017-09-25 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00 -> day8\n\n 32. We need the exact S(h) for each hour. We'll compute them:\n\n        We have the data for the 4 days. We'll create a table for the deviations.\n\n        We already have:\n\n            h0: [0.0662916667, 2.4760416667, 1.44775, 0.2604166667] -> avg=1.062625\n            h1: [-0.3247083333, 2.0850416667, 2.19475, 1.0424166667] -> avg=1.249375\n            h2: [-0.5727083333, 0.1660416667, 1.34175, 0.5804166667] -> avg=0.378875\n            h3: [-0.3597083333, 1.6940416667, 0.84375, 0.9004166667] -> avg=0.769625\n            h4: [-0.6087083333, 0.7340416667, 1.23475, 0.8294166667] -> avg=0.547375\n            h5: [-0.5017083333, 0.4860416667, 0.63075, -0.0945833333] -> avg=0.13\n\n        Let's do h6:\n\n            Day1: -2.025 -

We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-22 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n\n 44. We'll output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-22 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-09-22 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-09-25 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 45. We'll compute the values with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 46. Let's do the first few for day5:\n\n        00:00: -1.936125 + 1.062625 = -0.8735 -> -0.874\n        01:00: -1.936125 + 1.249375 = -0.68675 -> -0.687\n        02:00: -1.936125 + 0.378875 = -1.55725 -> -1.557\n        03:00: -1.936125 + 0.769625 = -1.1665 -> -1.167\n        04:00: -1.936125 + 0.547375 = -1.38875 -> -1.389\n        05:00: -1.936125 + 0.13 = -1.806125 -> -1.806\n        06:00: -1.936125 -0.491875 = -2.428 -> -2.428\n        07:00: -1.936125 + 0.13 = -1.806125 -> -1.806\n        08:00: -1.936125 + 0.698375 = -1.23775 -> -1.238\n        09:00: -1.936125 + 0.316375 = -1.61975 -> -1.620\n        10:00: -1.936125 + 0.574125 = -1.362 -> -1.362\n        11:00: -1.936125 + 1.000375 = -0.93575 -> -0.936\n        12:00: -1.936125 + 0.023375 = -1.91275 -> -1.913\n        13:00: -1.936125 -0.074625 = -2.01075 -> -2.011\n        14:00: -1.936125 -0.189875 = -2.126 -> -2.126\n        15:00: -1.936125 -0.447375 = -2.3835 -> -2.384\n        16:00: -1.936125 -0.394375 = -2.3305 -> -2.331\n        17:00: -1.936125 -0.678375 = -2.6145 -> -2.615\n        18:00: -1.936125 -1.495875 = -3.432 -> -3.432\n        19:00: -1.936125 -1.158375 = -3.0945 -> -3.095\n        20:00: -1.936125 -1.273625 = -3.20975 -> -3.210\n        21:00: -1.936125 -1.460375 = -3.3965 -> -3.397\n        22:00: -1.936125 + 0.236625 = -1.6995 -> -1.700\n        23:00: -1.936125 + 0.547375 = -1.38875 -> -1.389\n\n        For day6 (2017-09-23):\n\n        00:00: -2.2258333333 + 1.062625 = -1.1632083333 -> -1.163\n        01:00: -2.2258333333 + 1.249375 = -0.9764583333 -> -0.976\n        ... and so on.\n\n 47. We'll generate the full 96 values.\n\n 48.

We'll write a program in our mind to generate the 96 values.\n\n 50. We'll output the values with 3 decimal places.\n\n 51. Given the length, we are to provide the complete data, we will generate the entire list.\n\n 52.
