        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 3. Since the data shows a clear daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours) and some weekly pattern (if we had more data we might see weekly seasonality, but we only have 4 days), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note that we only have 4 days of data (96 hours) and we are to forecast the next 4 days. This is a very short history.\n\n Approach:\n Given the complexity and the need for a forecast without a long history, we can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) if we assume multiple seasonality? But we only have 4 days so weekly seasonality is not available.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: decompose the series into trend and seasonality and then project.\n\n But note: the data has a strong daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a seasonal naive method or a model that uses 24-hour seasonality.\n\n However, the data also has a trend? Let's look at the provided data:\n\n   - From 2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21: \n        The values at the same hour of the day are not exactly the same, but there is a pattern.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture the daily pattern and the trend over the 4 days.\n\n Proposed method:\n   We can use a moving average to remove noise and then compute the daily profile (average over the same hour for the 4 days) and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n 1. Check for missing values in the provided data? The problem says there might be, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we can proceed.\n\n 2. We will decompose the time series into:\n      - Trend component (using moving average with window=24, but we have only 4 cycles, so we can use a linear trend over the 4 days)\n      - Seasonal component: the daily pattern (24 hours)\n\n 3. We can use the following decomposition model: additive or multiplicative?\n    Let's check the variation: the amplitude of the seasonal pattern does not seem to change dramatically with the level, so additive might be acceptable.\n\n 4. Steps for decomposition (additive):\n      Y(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonal(t) + Residual(t)\n\n    We can estimate:\n      - Trend: using a centered moving average of 24 (to remove the seasonality). But with 4 days, we can also fit a linear regression for the trend.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n      Step 1: Compute the moving average of 24 hours to get the trend (but at the ends we lose some points). Since we have only 96 points, we can use a linear trend.\n\n      Step 2: Detrend the series by subtracting the trend (if additive) or dividing (if multiplicative). Then compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the detrended values at the same hour.\n\n      Step 3: The forecast: \n          Forecast(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonal(t mod 24)\n\n    But we need to project the trend for the next 96 hours.\n\n 5. However, note that the trend over 4 days might not be linear? We can fit a linear trend to the entire 96 points and then project.\n\n    Let:\n        time = [0,1,...,95]\n        Fit: Y(t) = a + b*t\n\n    Then the trend at time t is: a + b*t.\n\n    Then we compute the detrended series: Y_detrended(t) = Y(t) - (a + b*t)\n\n    Then for each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have 4 observations (from 4 days). We average the detrended values for each hour to get the seasonal component for that hour.\n\n    Then for future time t (from 96 to 191), we do:\n        Trend(t) = a + b*t\n        Seasonal(t) = seasonal_component[t mod 24]\n        Forecast(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonal(t)\n\n 6. But note: the residuals might be non-zero? We are ignoring the residuals. This is a simple method.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the last 24 hours of the seasonal component? But we are averaging over 4 days to get the seasonal pattern.\n\n 8. However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But the provided 96 points are complete. So we can use them.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Create a time index: t = 0,1,...,95.\n   Step 2: Fit a linear regression: HUFL = a + b*t + error.\n\n   Step 3: Compute the detrended series: \n        detrended = HUFL - (a + b*t)\n\n   Step 4: Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for each hour.\n\n        For example, for hour 0: we have 4 values (at t=0, t=24, t=48, t=72). Similarly for hour 1: t=1,25,49,73, etc.\n\n   Step 5: The seasonal component for hour i (i in 0..23) is the average of the detrended values at the same hour.\n\n   Step 6: For forecasting at time t (from 96 to 191):\n\n        t_index = t (which goes from 96 to 191, total 96 points)\n        trend_part = a + b * t_index\n        hour_of_day = t_index mod 24   (but note: our time index is continuous, so for t_index=96 -> 96 mod 24 = 0, which is hour 0 of the next day)\n\n        seasonal_part = seasonal_component[hour_of_day]\n\n        forecast = trend_part + seasonal_part\n\n 9. But note: the linear trend might not be the best because the data might have a changing trend? We have only 4 days, so it's acceptable.\n\n 10. Let's check the trend: \n        The data from 2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21: \n          Day1: 2017-03-18: starts at 11.788 and ends at 10.784\n          Day2: starts at 14.937 and ends at 8.172\n          Day3: starts at 11.052 and ends at 7.971\n          Day4: starts at 11.588 and ends at 9.980\n\n        The overall trend: we can see a slight downward trend? But let the linear regression decide.\n\n 11. We'll code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we can use them.\n\n 12. We must output the next 96 points in the same format: from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation in code (if we were to code) but we are to write the forecasted data.\n\n But note: we are an AI and we can do calculations. However, we are to output the data in the required format.\n\n Since we cannot run code here, we will simulate the steps:\n\n   Step 1: Fit the linear trend to the 96 points.\n\n        Let t = [0,1,...,95]\n        HUFL = [11.788, 12.927, ... , 9.980]\n\n        We can compute:\n          slope (b) and intercept (a)\n\n        How? \n          We can use the formulas:\n\n          n = 96\n          sum_t = (n-1)*n/2 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n          sum_t2 = (n-1)*n*(2*n-1)/6 = 95*96*191/6 = 95*16*191 = 95*3056 = 290320\n\n          sum_y = sum of all HUFL values\n          sum_ty = sum of t * HUFL(t) for t=0 to 95\n\n        But we don't have the exact sum_y and sum_ty? \n\n        Alternatively, we can approximate by the overall trend? \n\n        However, we are not to do the calculation by hand for 96 points. We must find a way.\n\n 13. Since we are to provide the forecast, we can use a simpler method: \n\n        We can use the last value and the trend from the linear regression? But we need the entire trend.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n\n        We can use the average of the last 24 hours and then apply the seasonal pattern? \n\n        But the problem requires 96 points.\n\n 15. Another idea: use a seasonal naive model: \n        Forecast for the next 24 hours is the same as the last 24 hours? \n        Then the next 24 hours after that is the same as the 24 hours before the last 24? \n\n        But that would be:\n\n          Day5 (2017-03-22) = Day4 (2017-03-21) \n          Day6 (2017-03-23) = Day3 (2017-03-20) \n          Day7 (2017-03-24) = Day2 (2017-03-19) \n          Day8 (2017-03-25) = Day1 (2017-03-18)\n\n        But that would be:\n\n          2017-03-22 00:00:00 = 2017-03-21 00:00:00 -> 11.588\n          2017-03-22 01:00:00 = 2017-03-21 01:00:00 -> 11.588\n          ... until 2017-03-22 23:00:00 = 2017-03-21 23:00:00 -> 9.980\n\n          Then 2017-03-23 00:00:00 = 2017-03-20 00:00:00 -> 11.052\n          ... and so on.\n\n        But this method ignores any trend and might not be accurate.\n\n 16. Given the time and the requirement, we choose a method that uses the average daily pattern and projects the last known level.\n\n        We can compute the average daily pattern (without detrending) and then adjust by the last day's average?\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Group by hour of the day and compute the average for each hour over the 4 days.\n\n          Step 2: We then use this average daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n          But this ignores any trend? \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the overall average of the 4 days and then the daily pattern as deviations from the mean.\n\n        Then we can use the last day's average as the base and add the deviations? \n\n        However, we are to do 4 days, so we can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        But note: the data shows a downward trend? We might want to project a slight downward trend.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a numerical forecast without the ability to compute exactly, we choose a simple method:\n\n        We will use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form the daily pattern, and then use that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n        Why? Because the trend over 4 days is not be strong enough to project, and we don't have enough data for a reliable linear trend.\n\n        How to compute:\n\n          For hour 0: (11.788 + 14.937 + 11.052 + 11.588) / 4 = (11.788+14.937=26.725; 26.725+11.052=37.777; 37.777+11.588=49.365) -> 49.365/4 = 12.34125\n          Similarly for hour 1: (12.927+14.669+11.\n\n        But we have to do for all 24 hours.\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n          Day1 (2017-03-22): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n          Day2 (2017-03-23): same as Day1\n          Day3 (2017-03-24): same\n          Day4 (2017-03-25): same\n\n        This is a simple seasonal model.\n\n 18. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are given 96 complete points, so we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n 19. We must compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n        Let's denote the data in a 4x24 matrix:\n\n          Day1: 2017-03-18: [11.788, 12.927, 12.123, 10.985, 11.454, 11.788, 15.070, 13.664, 11.253, 4.957, 6.564, 5.760, 2.009, 3.684, 6.564, 5.157, 5.693, 7.703, 7.301, 7.703, 7.167, 8.306, 8.172, 10.784]\n          Day2: 2017-03-19: [14.937, 14.669, 13.932, 11.655, 10.449, 9.578, 9.109, 11.119, 10.516, 7.636, 7.301, 8.306, 6.095, 5.425, 5.827, 6.631, 6.363, 8.640, 7.837, 7.502, 6.832, 5.961, 6.095, 8.172]\n          Day3: 2017-03-20: [11.052, 11.119, 9.377, 10.985, 10.985, 8.372, 8.306, 12.190, 8.439, 8.573, 8.306, 4.086, -0.067, 4.957, 3.014, 5.090, 6.631, 8.640, 8.038, 8.239, 7.234, 8.573, 9.042, 7.971]\n          Day4: 2017-03-21: [11.588, 11.588, 9.310, 7.770, 8.506, 9.578, 10.717, 11.521, 6.899, 4.756, 2.009, 0.737, -5.894, -11.253, -6.698, -6.229, -1.340, 5.693, 6.765, 8.172, 7.435, 7.234, 9.578, 9.980]\n\n        Now, for each hour (column index from 0 to 23), we compute the average.\n\n        Example for hour0 (index0): \n            (11.788 + 14.937 + 11.052 + 11.588) / 4 = (11.788+14.937=26.725; 26.725+11.052=37.777; 37.777+11.588=49.365) -> 49.365/4 = 12.34125\n\n        hour1: (12.927+14.669+11.119+11.588)/4 = (12.927+14.669=27.596; 27.596+11.119=38.715; 38.715+11.588=50.303) -> 50.303/4 = 12.57575\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then the forecast for 2017-03-22 00:00:00 is 12.34125, 2017-03-22 01:00:00 is 12.57575, ... until 2017-03-22 23:00:00.\n\n     Then we repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n 22. But note: the data on day4 (2017-03-21) has some negative values? So the average might be negative.\n\n 23. We must format the output to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 24. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 25. We compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: (11.788, 14.937, 11.052, 11.588) -> (11.788+14.937+11.052+11.588)/4 = 49.365/4 = 12.341\n        hour1: (12.927+14.669+11.119+11.588) = 50.303/4 = 12.576\n        hour2: (12.123+13.932+9.377+9.310) = 44.742/4 = 11.186\n        hour3: (10.985+11.655+10.985+7.770) = 41.395/4 = 10.349\n        hour4: (11.454+10.449+10.985+8.506) = 41.394/4 = 10.349\n        hour5: (11.788+9.578+8.372+9.578) = 39.316/4 = 9.829\n        hour6: (15.070+9.109+8.306+10.717) = 43.202/4 = 10.801\n        hour7: (13.664+11.119+12.190+11.521) = 48.494/4 = 12.124\n        hour8: (11.253+10.516+8.439+6.899) = 37.107/4 = 9.277\n        hour9: (4.957+7.636+8.573+4.756) = 25.922/4 = 6.481\n        hour10: (6.564+7.301+8.306+2.009) = 24.180/4 = 6.045\n        hour11: (5.760+8.306+4.086+0.737) = 18.889/4 = 4.722\n        hour12: (2.009+6.095-0.067-5.894) = (2.009+6.095=8.104; 8.104-0.067=8.037; 8.037-5.894=2.143) -> 2.143/4 = 0.536\n        hour13: (3.684+5.425+4.957-11.253) = (3.684+5.425=9.109; 9.109+4.957=14.066; 14.066-11.253=2.813) -> 2.813/4 = 0.703\n        hour14: (6.564+5.827+3.014-6.698) = (6.564+5.827=12.391; 12.391+3.014=15.405; 15.405-6.698=8.707) -> 8.707/4 = 2.177\n        hour15: (5.157+6.631+5.090-6.229) = (5.157+6.631=11.788; 11.788+5.090=16.878; 16.878-6.229=10.649) -> 10.649/4 = 2.662\n        hour16: (5.693+6.363+6.631-1.340) = (5.693+6.363=12.056; 12.056+6.631=18.687; 18.687-1.340=17.347) -> 17.347/4 = 4.337\n        hour17: (7.703+8.640+8.640+5.693) = (7.703+8.640=16.343; 16.343+8.640=24.983; 24.983+5.693=30.676) -> 30.676/4 = 7.669\n        hour18: (7.301+7.837+8.038+6.765) = (7.301+7.837=15.138; 15.138+8.038=23.176; 23.176+6.765=29.941) -> 29.941/4 = 7.485\n        hour19: (7.703+7.502+8.239+8.172) = (7.703+7.502=15.205; 15.205+8.239=23.444; 23.444+8.172=31.616) -> 31.616/4 = 7.904\n        hour20: (7.167+6.832+7.234+7.435) = (7.167+6.832=13.999; 13.999+7.234=21.233; 21.233+7.435=28.668) -> 28.668/4 = 7.167\n        hour21: (8.306+5.961+8.573+7.234) = (8.306+5.961=14.267; 14.267+8.573=22.840; 22.840+7.234=30.074) -> 30.074/4 = 7.519\n        hour22: (8.172+6.095+9.042+9.578) = (8.172+6.095=14.267; 14.267+9.042=23.309; 23.309+9.578=32.887) -> 32.887/4 = 8.222\n        hour23: (10.784+8.172+7.971+9.980) = (10.784+8.172=18.956; 18.956+7.971=26.927; 26.927+9.980=36.907) -> 36.907/4 = 9.227\n\n 26.
