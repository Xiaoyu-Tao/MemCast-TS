        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. \n    However, the provided sample for the past 96 points is complete. We must be cautious for the forecast.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon for this short history),\n    we need a method that can capture seasonality and trends.\n\n 4. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be daily seasonality (24 hours). The pattern repeats every day? Let's check:\n        The data spans 4 days (from 2017-07-08 to 2017-07-11). \n\n 5. We can use a model that accounts for seasonality. Since the data is at hourly frequency and we suspect daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 6. Given the small data size, we might use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day (or last available same hour). But we have only 4 days, so we can use the last day (day 4) to forecast the next day?\n      However, the pattern might not be stable.\n\n    - We can also try Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with a seasonality of 24.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA). However, with only 96 points and a seasonal period of 24, the number of parameters might be too high relative to the data.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we must produce 96 forecasts. We'll use a method that is robust and can handle the seasonality.\n\n 9. We note that the data has negative values and fluctuations.\n\n 10. We decide to use a simple method: \n      - We will decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and then forecast each component.\n      - But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last two days to forecast the next two days? But the problem requires 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 12. We can use a seasonal naive method for the next 24 hours by taking the same hour from the previous day (i.e., from 2017-07-11) and then for the next 24 hours, we can use the day before that (2017-07-10) and so on? \n      But that would be:\n        Day 1 (2017-07-12) = Day (2017-07-11)\n        Day 2 (2017-07-13) = Day (2017-07-10)\n        Day 3 (2017-07-14) = Day (2017-07-09)\n        Day 4 (2017-07-15) = Day (2017-07-08)\n\n      However, this might not be accurate and the problem does not specify the date of the next 96, but we know the last date is 2017-07-11 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours will be from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n 13. But note: the data does not show a clear pattern of repeating every day. For example, the first day (2017-07-08) and the last day (2017-07-11) are quite different.\n\n 14. We can also consider using an average of the four days for each hour? But that would be a constant pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide an answer, we choose a simple method: \n      We will use the last available day (2017-07-11) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 identical days. \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the recent pattern.\n\n 17. We decide to use a seasonal naive method using the last day (2017-07-11) for the first 24 hours, then the day before (2017-07-10) for the next 24, and so on until we have 96 hours.\n\n    Specifically:\n        For the first 24 hours (2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-12 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-07-11 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n        For the next 24 hours (2017-07-13 00:00:00 to 2017-07-13 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-07-10 00:00:00 to 2017-07-10 23:00:00.\n        For the next 24 hours (2017-07-14 00:00:00 to 2017-07-14 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-07-09 00:00:00 to 2017-07-09 23:00:00.\n        For the next 24 hours (2017-07-15 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00): use the values from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-08 23:00:00.\n\n    Why? Because we have exactly 4 days of history. We are using the most recent day for the first forecast day, then the day before for the second, etc.\n\n 18. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values. So we can use the above.\n\n 19. But let's check: the last day (2017-07-11) has 24 points? Yes, from 00:00 to 23:00. Similarly for the others.\n\n 20. We generate the next 96 points by concatenating:\n        Day1: 2017-07-11 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> becomes 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-07-10 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> becomes 2017-07-13 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-07-09 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> becomes 2017-07-14 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> becomes 2017-07-15 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 21. We must generate the dates accordingly. The last date in the given data is 2017-07-11 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-07-12 00:00:00.\n\n 22. We write the forecast:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00 -> value from 2017-07-11 00:00:00: -0.804\n        Then 2017-07-12 01:00:00 -> value from 2017-07-11 01:00:00: -0.871\n        ... until 2017-07-12 23:00:00: -1.072\n\n        Then 2017-07-13 00:00:00 -> value from 2017-07-10 00:00:00: -0.670\n        ... until 2017-07-13 23:00:00: -0.536\n\n        Then 2017-07-14 00:00:00 -> value from 2017-07-09 00:00:00: 0.938\n        ... until 2017-07-14 23:00:00: -1.273\n\n        Then 2017-07-15 00:00:00 -> value from 2017-07-08 00:00:00: 0.000\n        ... until 2017-07-15 23:00:00: -0.603\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not told how to handle missing values in the forecast period? \n      We are using historical data that is complete, so we are safe.\n\n 24. However, this method is very simplistic. But given the data and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is as long as the history) without a clear trend, it is acceptable.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we could use the average of the four days for each hour? \n        For hour 00:00: average of [0.000 (2017-07-08), 0.938 (2017-07-09), -0.670 (2017-07-10), -0.804 (2017-07-11)] = (0.000+0.938-0.670-0.804)/4 = (-0.536)/4 = -0.134\n        Then for each hour we compute the average and then repeat that same daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n      But this would give the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 26. We choose the first method (recent days in reverse order) because it is simpler and uses the most recent day for the immediate forecast, which might be more relevant.\n\n 27. We generate the dates:\n\n        We start from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 and go to 2017-07-15 23:00:00 (96 hours).\n\n 28. We write the forecasted values:\n\n        Day1 (2017-07-12): \n            HULL: [-0.804, -0.871, -1.273, -1.808, -1.072, -1.808, -1.608, -0.737, 0.000, 0.603, 1.541, 2.411, 1.875, 1.942, 1.808, 0.938, -0.067, -1.273, -1.942, -2.009, -1.474, -1.608, -1.340, -1.072]\n\n        Day2 (2017-07-13):\n            HULL: [-0.670, -0.201, -0.067, -0.871, -1.340, -2.076, -2.612, -2.143, -1.072, -0.938, -0.670, -1.139, -1.206, 0.268, -0.603, -0.335, -1.674, -1.608, -2.612, -2.210, -2.210, -2.009, -2.009, -0.536]\n\n        Day3 (2017-07-14):\n            HULL: [0.938, 0.268, 0.000, -0.938, -0.536, 0.000, -0.871, -0.737, -0.670, -1.005, -0.871, -0.871, -1.541, -1.741, -1.741, -1.808, -2.143, -2.143, -2.478, -3.215, -2.679, -3.684, -1.340, -1.273]\n\n        Day4 (2017-07-15):\n            HULL: [0.000, 1.206, 1.072, 0.804, 0.402, -0.402, -0.335, 0.335, -0.469, 0.000, -0.536, -0.804, 0.670, -1.072, -1.072, -0.938, -1.340, -1.608, -2.009, -1.407, -1.273, -1.808, -0.603, -0.603]\n\n 29. We must format the answer exactly as:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00  -0.804\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00  -0.871\n        ... (all 96 lines)\n        2017-07-15 23:00:00  -0.603\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n 30. We write the data accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any in the history, and we are generating a complete forecast. \n\n But if we are to be more sophisticated, we could use an imputation for any missing values in the history? But the history is complete.\n\n Let's proceed with the above.\n\n But wait: the last day in the history (2017-07-11) has the value for 00:00:00 as -0.804, and we are using that for 2017-07-12 00:00:00.\n\n We generate the next 96 points by taking:\n\n   First 24: from 2017-07-11 (the last day in the history) in order of hours 00 to 23.\n   Next 24: from 2017-07-10 (the day before the last) in order of hours 00 to 23.\n   Next 24: from 2017-07-09 (two days before the last) in order of hours 00 to 23.\n   Last 24: from 2017-07-08 (three days before the last) in order of hours 00 to 23.\n\n This is our forecast.\n\n Let's code the values:\n\n   Day1 (2017-07-12): \n        HULL = [ -0.804, -0.871, -1.273, -1.808, -1.072, -1.808, -1.608, -0.737, 0.000, 0.603, 1.541, 2.411, 1.875, 1.942, 1.808, 0.938, -0.067, -1.273, -1.942, -2.009, -1.474, -1.608, -1.340, -1.072 ]\n\n   Day2 (2017-07-13):\n        HULL = [ -0.670, -0.201, -0.067, -0.871, -1.340, -2.076, -2.612, -2.143, -1.072, -0.938, -0.670, -1.139, -1.206, 0.268, -0.603, -0.335, -1.674, -1.608, -2.612, -2.210, -2.210, -2.009, -2.009, -0.536 ]\n\n   Day3 (2017-07-14):\n        HULL = [ 0.938, 0.268, 0.000, -0.938, -0.536, 0.000, -0.871, -0.737, -0.670, -1.005, -0.871, -0.871, -1.541, -1.741, -1.741, -1.808, -2.143, -2.143, -2.478, -3.215, -2.679, -3.684, -1.340, -1.273 ]\n\n   Day4 (2017-07-15):\n        HULL = [ 0.000, 1.206, 1.072, 0.804, 0.402, -0.402, -0.335, 0.335, -0.469, 0.000, -0.536, -0.804, 0.670, -1.072, -1.072, -0.938, -1.340, -1.608, -2.009, -1.407, -1.273, -1.808, -0.603, -0.603 ]\n\n 31. We write the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-13 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-14 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-15 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00\n\n 32. We output the data in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data is sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes. In this case, the given data is hourly (96 points for 4 days). So we output hourly.\n\n Let's write the answer.\n",
