        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-30 00:00:00 to 2016-09-02 23:00:00). We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing value issue? But in the provided data, we don't see any explicit missing values (like NaN). However, we observe that on 2016-08-31, the value is constant (12.366) for 24 hours. This might be an anomaly or missing data imputed with a constant? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious.\n\n 2. Since the problem does not specify the exact method to use, we choose a robust method for time series forecasting. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because of the potential daily seasonality (24 hours in a day).\n    - Alternatively, we can use a model that handles multiple seasonality, but since we only have 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days, we might not have enough data for complex seasonality.\n\n 3. However, note that the data we have is only 4 days. This is a very short history. Therefore, we must rely on a model that can work with limited data.\n\n 4. We observe that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern: higher values at night (e.g., around 00:00) and lower during the day? But looking at the data, it's not very clear because of the anomaly on 2016-08-31.\n\n 5. The challenge: the entire day of 2016-08-31 is constant. This might be an error. We have to decide how to handle it.\n\n    Option 1: Treat it as an anomaly and replace it with the average of the same hour from the other days? But we only have 3 other days (30th, 1st, 2nd) and one of them is the same month? But 30th and 1st are consecutive.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\", so we are allowed to impute. But note: we are only given the past 96 points and we are to forecast the next 96. We are not asked to fix the past. So we can use the data as is? But the constant value might throw off the model.\n\n    Option 2: We can use a model that is robust to such anomalies? Or we can preprocess the data by replacing the constant day with a more reasonable pattern? But the problem does not specify that we should fix the past. So we must be cautious.\n\n    Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", we can try to handle the missing values in the training data by imputation. However, note that the problem does not specify which points are missing. In the provided data, we see a constant for 24 hours, which is suspicious. We decide to impute the constant day (2016-08-31) with the average of the same hour from the other three days (2016-08-30, 2016-09-01, 2016-09-02) for each hour.\n\n    Steps for imputation:\n        For each hour (0 to 23) on 2016-08-31, we replace the constant 12.366 with the average of the same hour on 2016-08-30, 2016-09-01, and 2016-09-02.\n\n    But note: 2016-08-30 is the first day, 2016-09-01 and 2016-09-02 are the next two. We have 3 days of data for each hour.\n\n    Example for hour 00:00:\n        Aug-30: 10.127, Sep-01: 10.874, Sep-02: 9.452 -> average = (10.127+10.874+9.452)/3 = 10.151\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 6. After imputation, we have a cleaned training set of 96 points.\n\n 7. We then build a model. Given the daily seasonality (period=24) and the short history, we can use a seasonal ARIMA model. We will use auto_arima to find the best parameters, but note that we have limited data.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the available days? But that would be a naive forecast and might not capture trends.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have 4 days of history, we can try:\n\n    Model: SARIMA with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24). But with only 4 days, we cannot fit a very complex model.\n\n    We can try:\n        d = 0 or 1? (differencing)\n        D = 1 (for seasonality) because we have daily seasonality.\n\n    But auto_arima might be the best to automatically select parameters.\n\n 9. However, note: we are in a simulated environment and we cannot run code. We have to simulate the process.\n\n    We are to provide the forecasted values for the next 96 hours (from 2016-09-03 00:00:00 to 2016-09-06 23:00:00).\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will:\n\n     Step 1: Impute the constant day (2016-08-31) by the average of the same hour from the other three days.\n\n     Step 2: Fit a SARIMA model. Since we cannot run code, we have to assume a model. We note that the data has:\n\n          - A daily pattern: the values are higher during the night and lower during the day? But looking at the data:\n\n            Aug-30: \n              00:00: 10.127, then drops to 9.452, then 9.666, then 8.671, then rises to 9.950, 10.376, 11.655 (07:00), then drops to 10.092, 7.285, ... until 12:00: 5.401, then a bit up and down until 23:00: 10.909.\n\n            So it seems that the load is higher at the beginning and end of the day and lower in the middle? \n\n          - There might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly.\n\n     Step 3: We choose a simple model: SARIMA(1,0,1) with a 24-hour seasonality and seasonal order (0,1,1). This is a common starting point.\n\n     But note: we have only 4 days, so we cannot use a high order.\n\n 11. Since we cannot actually run the model, we have to generate the forecast by hand? That is not feasible.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the average of the same hour from the available days (without the imputed day) for the next days? But that would be:\n\n        For hour 00:00: average of 2016-08-30, 2016-09-01, 2016-09-02 -> 10.151 (as above) and then use that for 2016-09-03 00:00, 2016-09-04 00:00, etc.\n\n        But that would be constant for each hour across the days? We don't capture any trend.\n\n     However, we don't have a long history to capture trend. So we can do:\n\n        Let F(t) for t in [00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00] be the average of that hour from the three days (30th, 1st, 2nd).\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be:\n\n            Day 1 (2016-09-03): F(00:00), F(01:00), ... F(23:00)\n            Day 2 (2016-09-04): same as Day 1\n            Day 3 (2016-09-05): same as Day 1\n            Day 4 (2016-09-06): same as Day 1\n\n     But note: the problem says \"Middle UseFul Load\", and we don't know if there is a weekly pattern (like weekends) but we don't have enough data to know.\n\n 12. Considering the above, and the fact that we have very limited data, the naive method might be acceptable.\n\n     However, we note that the data for 2016-08-31 was imputed by the same method? So we are effectively using the same pattern.\n\n 13. Steps for the naive forecast:\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour from the three days (2016-08-30, 2016-09-01, 2016-09-02). We skip 2016-08-31 because we imputed it from these same days? Actually, we imputed 2016-08-31 from these days, so we don't want to use it again.\n\n        So we use the original three days.\n\n        Example for hour 00:00: (10.127 + 10.874 + 9.452) / 3 = 10.151\n        hour 01:00: (10.341 + 9.701 + 8.209) / 3 = 9.417\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n        Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says \"forecast\", and the naive method is a valid baseline.\n\n 15. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 16. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (10.127, 10.874, 9.452) -> 10.151\n        hour1: (10.341, 9.701, 8.209) -> 9.417\n        hour2: (9.452, 9.772, 8.564) -> 9.2627\n        hour3: (9.666, 10.305, 7.853) -> 9.2747\n        hour4: (8.671, 8.599, 8.564) -> 8.6113\n        hour5: (9.950, 9.239, 9.132) -> 9.4403\n        hour6: (10.376, 9.737, 9.239) -> 9.784\n        hour7: (11.655, 10.661, 8.351) -> 10.2223\n        hour8: (10.092, 7.214, 8.457) -> 8.5877\n        hour9: (7.285, 6.823, 7.604) -> 7.2373\n        hour10: (6.787, 7.000, 7.533) -> 7.1067\n        hour11: (7.000, 7.320, 7.391) -> 7.237\n        hour12: (5.401, 6.005, 5.543) -> 5.6497\n        hour13: (6.325, 5.792, 6.041) -> 6.0527\n        hour14: (5.792, 5.828, 6.041) -> 5.887\n        hour15: (6.112, 6.929, 6.610) -> 6.5503\n        hour16: (5.437, 6.610, 6.538) -> 6.195\n        hour17: (5.899, 6.467, 6.432) -> 6.266\n        hour18: (5.366, 5.686, 5.757) -> 5.603\n        hour19: (5.188, 5.828, 6.219) -> 5.745\n        hour20: (5.899, 6.574, 6.681) -> 6.3847\n        hour21: (7.533, 5.934, 6.041) -> 6.5027\n        hour22: (9.310, 6.183, 7.995) -> 7.8293\n        hour23: (10.909, 7.960, 9.132) -> 9.3337\n\n 17. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (starting from 2016-09-03 00:00:00) is:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-09-03): \n            00:00: 10.151\n            01:00: 9.417\n            ... until 23:00: 9.3337\n\n        Day 2 (2016-09-04): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (2016-09-05): same\n        Day 4 (2016-09-06): same\n\n 18. But note: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n        The last date in the given data is 2016-09-02 23:00:00.\n        The next 96 hours:\n\n            2016-09-03 00:00:00\n            2016-09-03 01:00:00\n            ...\n            2016-09-03 23:00:00\n            2016-09-04 00:00:00\n            ...\n            2016-09-06 23:00:00\n\n 19. We output the data in the same format.\n\n 20. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 21. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 22. But wait: we are an expert and we are expected to use a more sophisticated method? However, with only 4 days of data, and one of them being an anomaly that we imputed, the naive method might be the best we can do.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we could use exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) but again, we don't have enough data to fit the parameters.\n\n 24. We stick to the naive method.\n\n 25. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 26. Let's create the forecast:\n\n        We have the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n        hour0: 10.151 -> 10.151\n        hour1: 9.417 -> 9.417\n        hour2: (9.452+9.772+8.564)/3 = 27.788/3=9.2627 -> 9.263\n        hour3: (9.666+10.305+7.853)=27.824/3=9.2747 -> 9.275\n        hour4: (8.671+8.599+8.564)=25.834/3=8.6113 -> 8.611\n        hour5: (9.950+9.239+9.132)=28.321/3=9.4403 -> 9.440\n        hour6: (10.376+9.737+9.239)=29.352/3=9.784 -> 9.784\n        hour7: (11.655+10.661+8.351)=30.667/3=10.2223 -> 10.222\n        hour8: (10.092+7.214+8.457)=25.763/3=8.5877 -> 8.588\n        hour9: (7.285+6.823+7.604)=21.712/3=7.2373 -> 7.237\n        hour10: (6.787+7.000+7.533)=21.32/3=7.1067 -> 7.107\n        hour11: (7.000+7.320+7.391)=21.711/3=7.237 -> 7.237\n        hour12: (5.401+6.005+5.543)=16.949/3=5.6497 -> 5.650\n        hour13: (6.325+5.792+6.041)=18.158/3=6.0527 -> 6.053\n        hour14: (5.792+5.828+6.041)=17.661/3=5.887 -> 5.887\n        hour15: (6.112+6.929+6.610)=19.651/3=6.5503 -> 6.550\n        hour16: (5.437+6.610+6.538)=18.585/3=6.195 -> 6.195\n        hour17: (5.899+6.467+6.432)=18.798/3=6.266 -> 6.266\n        hour18: (5.366+5.686+5.757)=16.809/3=5.603 -> 5.603\n        hour19: (5.188+5.828+6.219)=17.235/3=5.745 -> 5.745\n        hour20: (5.899+6.574+6.681)=19.154/3=6.3847 -> 6.385\n        hour21: (7.533+5.934+6.041)=19.508/3=6.5027 -> 6.503\n        hour22: (9.310+6.183+7.995)=23.488/3=7.8293 -> 7.829\n        hour23: (10.909+7.960+9.132)=28.001/3=9.3337 -> 9.334\n\n 27. Now we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        date: starting from 2016-09-03 00:00:00 to 2016-09-06 23:00:00\n\n        We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 3rd, Day 2: 4th, Day 3: 5th, Day 4: 6th.\n\n        For each day, we output the 24 hours with the corresponding average.\n\n 28.

But note: the original data had 3 decimal places, so we rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 37. We are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records ... between July 2016 and July 2018\", but we are only given 4 days? And we are forecasting 4 days? That seems a very short period. But the problem states: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", so we are only using 96 hours (4 days) to forecast the next 96 hours.\n\n 38. We output the above.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Please note that these data will have missing values\", and we handled the constant day by imputation. We did not use the constant day in the training for the forecast? Actually, we replaced the constant day with the average of the other days, so we have 4 days of data? But then we used the three original days to compute the average for the forecast? \n\n    We have two options for the training data:\n\n        Option A: Use the original three days (without the imputed day) to compute the pattern.\n\n        Option B: Use all four days (including the imputed day) to compute the pattern? But the imputed day is already the average of the three, so it would be the same pattern? \n\n    Actually, if we use the four days, then each hour would be the average of the three original and the imputed (which is the average of the three) -> so the average of four would be the same as the average of three? \n\n        Let the three original values be a, b, c, and the imputed is (a+b+c)/3.\n\n        Then the average of four: (a+b+c + (a+b+c)/3) / 4 = ( (4/3)*(a+b+c) ) / 4 = (a+b+c)/3.\n\n        So it's the same.\n\n    Therefore, we can use the entire 4 days? But we already imputed the constant day, so we have 4 days of data. Then we can compute the average for each hour over the 4 days? But that would be the same as the average of the three? \n\n    So we are consistent.\n\n 39. We output the above.\n\n 40. However, note: the problem says \"Middle UseFul Load\", and we are forecasting for the next 4 days. We are using a naive method. We hope that the pattern is stable.\n\n 41. We provide the answer.\n",
