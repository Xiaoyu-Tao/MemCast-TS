        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has a clear daily pattern (24 hours). We can observe that during the day the values are more negative (or less positive) and at night they become positive (around 17:00 to 22:00 we see positive spike?).\n    However, looking at the data, note that on 2017-10-04, the positive values start at 17:00 and go until 23:00. Similarly, on 2017-10-05, positive values are from 17:00 to 23:00? But note the values on 2017-10-05 at 17:00 is 0.609 and then decrease? \n    Actually, the pattern is not entirely consistent. We see that the positive values occur in the evening and night, and negative during the day.\n\n 2. Given the small dataset (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a simple method that captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 3. Since the data is small and we are to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - A seasonal naive method: each hour in the next day is the same as the same hour in the last available day (2017-10-07) OR\n    - Average the same hour over the available 4 days? But note: the data starts at 2017-10-04 and ends at 2017-10-07 (4 days). We have 4 days of data.\n\n 4. However, we note that the pattern might be evolving. Also, the last day (2017-10-07) has a higher positive spike in the evening? \n\n 5. Considering the requirement and the simplicity, we can use the following:\n    - We will use the average of the same hour for the 4 days we have to forecast the next 4 days? But note: the next 4 days are consecutive and we don't have any trend? \n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-10-07) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But the problem says the data might have missing values? However, the provided data does not have missing values in the 96 points.\n\n 7. Since the problem states that the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we assume that the forecasting method should be robust to missing values? But for forecasting the next 96, we don't have missing values in the future? \n\n 8. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use:\n    - Method 1: Seasonal Naive: use the last day (2017-10-07) and repeat it 4 times? \n    - Method 2: Use the average of each hour over the 4 days.\n\n 9. Let's compare the two methods:\n\n    Method 1 (repeat last day):\n        Day 1 (2017-10-08): same as 2017-10-07\n        Day 2 (2017-10-09): same as 2017-10-07\n        Day 3 (2017-10-10): same as 2017-10-07\n        Day 4 (2017-10-11): same as 2017-10-07\n\n    Method 2 (average per hour):\n        For each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00), we take the average of that hour from the 4 days (2017-10-04, 05, 06, 07) and use that for each day in the forecast.\n\n 10. We note that the data has a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). The next 4 days are Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed? \n     However, we don't have data for Sunday, Monday, etc. to compare. So we cannot account for weekly seasonality.\n\n 11. Given the limited data, we choose Method 2: average per hour. This will smooth out any day-to-day variations and provide a stable forecast.\n\n 12. Steps for Method 2:\n     - Group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each of the 24 hours.\n     - Then, for each day in the forecast period (4 days), we assign the 24 hourly averages.\n\n 13. However, note that the data we have is for 4 consecutive days. The next 4 days might have a similar pattern? \n\n 14. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 00:00: [ -1.127 (10-04), 0.366 (10-05), 0.487 (10-06), 0.701 (10-07) ] -> average = (-1.127 + 0.366 + 0.487 + 0.701) / 4 = (0.427) \n        But let me calculate: \n            -1.127 + 0.366 = -0.761\n            -0.761 + 0.487 = -0.274\n            -0.274 + 0.701 = 0.427 -> 0.427/4? Actually, we have 4 numbers: so 0.427/4 = 0.10675? \n        Actually: \n            sum = -1.127 + 0.366 + 0.487 + 0.701 = 0.427\n            average = 0.427 / 4 = 0.10675\n\n     Similarly, we do for all hours.\n\n 15. But note: the data for 2017-10-04 is Wednesday, and the next days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and then Sunday? \n     We are forecasting for 2017-10-08 (Sunday) to 2017-10-11 (Wednesday). \n\n     However, we don't have a Sunday in the training? So the average for Sunday might be different? But we don't have data to support.\n\n 16. Given the constraints, we proceed with the average of the 4 days.\n\n 17. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 18. We must generate 96 data points (4 days * 24 hours).\n\n 19. The dates for the forecast should start at 2017-10-08 00:00:00 and then every hour until 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We must format the answer exactly as the input: two columns, the first is the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", the second is the LULL value (with 3 decimal places? as in the input).\n\n 21. We note that the input data has 3 decimal places, so we will round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 22. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the values for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n     Day 1: 2017-10-04 (index 0 to 23)\n     Day 2: 2017-10-05 (index 24 to 47)\n     Day 3: 2017-10-06 (index 48 to 71)\n     Day 4: 2017-10-07 (index 72 to 95)\n\n     We can group by the hour of the day.\n\n 23. We'll compute:\n\n     hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72 -> values: -1.127, 0.366, 0.487, 0.701 -> average = ( -1.127 + 0.366 + 0.487 + 0.701 ) / 4 = 0.427/4 = 0.10675 -> 0.107\n     hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73 -> -1.127, 0.396, 0.426, 0.640 -> (-1.127+0.396+0.426+0.640)=0.335 -> 0.335/4=0.08375 -> 0.084\n     hour2: indices 2,26,50,74 -> -1.127,0.426,0.366,0.609 -> (-1.127+0.426+0.366+0.609)=0.274 -> 0.274/4=0.0685 -> 0.069\n     hour3: indices 3,27,51,75 -> -1.188,0.396,0.457,0.640 -> (-1.188+0.396+0.457+0.640)=0.305 -> 0.305/4=0.07625 -> 0.076\n     hour4: indices 4,28,52,76 -> -1.157,0.426,0.487,0.731 -> (-1.157+0.426+0.487+0.731)=0.487 -> 0.487/4=0.12175 -> 0.122\n     hour5: indices 5,29,53,77 -> -1.036,0.457,0.518,0.640 -> (-1.036+0.457+0.518+0.640)=0.579 -> 0.579/4=0.14475 -> 0.145\n     hour6: indices 6,30,54,78 -> -1.066,0.426,0.548,0.640 -> (-1.066+0.426+0.548+0.640)=0.548 -> 0.548/4=0.137 -> 0.137\n     hour7: indices 7,31,55,79 -> -1.036,0.518,0.731,0.792 -> (-1.036+0.518+0.731+0.792)=1.005 -> 1.005/4=0.25125 -> 0.251\n     hour8: indices 8,32,56,80 -> -0.761,0.609,1.097,1.249 -> (-0.761+0.609+1.097+1.249)=2.194 -> 2.194/4=0.5485 -> 0.549\n     hour9: indices 9,33,57,81 -> -0.792,0.640,0.883,1.097 -> (-0.792+0.640+0.883+1.097)=1.828 -> 1.828/4=0.457 -> 0.457\n     hour10: indices 10,34,58,82 -> -0.883,0.701,0.975,1.005 -> (-0.883+0.701+0.975+1.005)=1.798 -> 1.798/4=0.4495 -> 0.450\n     hour11: indices 11,35,59,83 -> -0.914,0.670,0.853,0.944 -> (-0.914+0.670+0.853+0.944)=1.553 -> 1.553/4=0.38825 -> 0.388\n     hour12: indices 12,36,60,84 -> -0.853,0.822,0.853,0.822 -> (-0.853+0.822+0.853+0.822)=1.644 -> 1.644/4=0.411 -> 0.411\n     hour13: indices 13,37,61,85 -> -0.731,0.761,0.944,0.975 -> (-0.731+0.761+0.944+0.975)=1.949 -> 1.949/4=0.48725 -> 0.487\n     hour14: indices 14,38,62,86 -> -0.853,0.640,1.005,0.944 -> (-0.853+0.640+1.005+0.944)=1.736 -> 1.736/4=0.434 -> 0.434\n     hour15: indices 15,39,63,87 -> -1.036,0.640,0.914,0.944 -> (-1.036+0.640+0.914+0.944)=1.462 -> 1.462/4=0.3655 -> 0.366\n     hour16: indices 16,40,64,88 -> -1.066,0.670,0.914,1.005 -> (-1.066+0.670+0.914+1.005)=1.523 -> 1.523/4=0.38075 -> 0.381\n     hour17: indices 17,41,65,89 -> 0.518,0.609,0.701,0.853 -> (0.518+0.609+0.701+0.853)=2.681 -> 2.681/4=0.67025 -> 0.670\n     hour18: indices 18,42,66,90 -> 0.457,0.548,0.670,0.761 -> (0.457+0.548+0.670+0.761)=2.436 -> 2.436/4=0.609 -> 0.609\n     hour19: indices 19,43,67,91 -> 0.457,0.457,0.640,0.731 -> (0.457+0.457+0.640+0.731)=2.285 -> 2.285/4=0.57125 -> 0.571\n     hour20: indices 20,44,68,92 -> 0.457,0.518,0.640,0.761 -> (0.457+0.518+0.640+0.761)=2.376 -> 2.376/4=0.594 -> 0.594\n     hour21: indices 21,45,69,93 -> 0.396,0.579,0.731,0.944 -> (0.396+0.579+0.731+0.944)=2.650 -> 2.650/4=0.6625 -> 0.663\n     hour22: indices 22,46,70,94 -> 0.366,0.548,0.670,0.822 -> (0.366+0.548+0.670+0.822)=2.406 -> 2.406/4=0.6015 -> 0.602\n     hour23: indices 23,47,71,95 -> 0.335,0.518,0.731,0.822 -> (0.335+0.518+0.731+0.822)=2.406 -> 2.406/4=0.6015 -> 0.602\n\n 24. Now, we have 24 hourly averages. We will use these 24 values for each day in the forecast period.\n\n 25. The next 4 days are:\n      Day 1: 2017-10-08 (Sunday) -> hours: 00:00 to 23:00\n      Day 2: 2017-10-09 (Monday)\n      Day 3: 2017-10-10 (Tuesday)\n      Day 4: 2017-10-11 (Wednesday)\n\n 26. We generate the data:\n\n     2017-10-08 00:00:00 -> 0.107\n     2017-10-08 01:00:00 -> 0.084\n     ... until 2017-10-08 23:00:00 -> 0.602\n\n     Then repeat the same 24 values for the next day, and so on.\n\n 27. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 28. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-08 00:00:00 0.107\n2017-10-08 01:00:00 0.084\n...\n2017-10-11 23:00:00 0.602\n```\n\n 29. We note that the input had negative values, but our averages are positive? That's because the first day (2017-10-04) had negative values during the day and positive only in the evening, but the next days had more positive values. The average over 4 days for the early hours (like 00:00) is positive because the last three days were positive and only the first day was negative.\n\n 30. This method is simple and we are using the available data.\n\n 31. We output the data in the required format.\n\n Let's write the forecast for the first 24 hours (2017-10-08) and then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n Note: We rounded the averages to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n The 24 hourly averages (from hour0 to hour23) are:\n\n [0.107, 0.084, 0.069, 0.076, 0.122, 0.145, 0.137, 0.251, 0.549, 0.457, 0.450, 0.388, 0.411, 0.487, 0.434, 0.366, 0.381, 0.670, 0.609, 0.571, 0.594, 0.663, 0.602, 0.602]\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n  2017-10-08 00:00:00 -> 0.107\n  2017-10-08 01:00:00 -> 0.084\n  2017-10-08 02:00:00 -> 0.069\n  2017-10-08 03:00:00 -> 0.076\n  2017-10-08 04:00:00 -> 0.122\n  2017-10-08 05:00:00 -> 0.145\n  2017-10-08 06:00:00 -> 0.137\n  2017-10-08 07:00:00 -> 0.251\n  2017-10-08 08:00:00 -> 0.549\n  2017-10-08 09:00:00 -> 0.457\n  2017-10-08 10:00:00 -> 0.450\n  2017-10-08 11:00:00 -> 0.388\n  2017-10-08 12:00:00 -> 0.411\n  2017-10-08 13:00:00 -> 0.487\n  2017-10-08 14:00:00 -> 0.434\n  2017-10-08 15:00:00 -> 0.366\n  2017-10-08 16:00:00 -> 0.381\n  2017-10-08 17:00:00 -> 0.670\n  2017-10-08 18:00:00 -> 0.609\n  2017-10-08 19:00:00 -> 0.571\n  2017-10-08 20:00:00 -> 0.594\n  2017-10-08 21:00:00 -> 0.663\n  2017-10-08 22:00:00 -> 0.602\n  2017-10-08 23:00:00 -> 0.602\n\n  Then repeat the same 24 values for 2017-10-09, 2017-10-10, and 2017-10-11.\n\n 32. We write the entire 96 rows.\n\n 33. We must be cautious: the date format must be exactly as the input.\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-10-08 00:00:00\n     Then add one hour until 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n 35. We output the date string and then the value (with a space in between? the input had a space and then the value). The input had the LULL value with a space and then the number.\n\n 36. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 37. Note: The problem says the data might have missing values, but we are forecasting without missing values. We are providing a complete forecast.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n  We have a list of 24 values: \n      hourly_avg = [0.107, 0.084, 0.069, 0.076, 0.122, 0.145, 0.137, 0.251, 0.549, 0.457, 0.450, 0.388, 0.411, 0.487, 0.434, 0.366, 0.381, 0.670, 0.609, 0.571, 0.594, 0.663, 0.602, 0.602]\n\n  For day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n      for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n          date = start_date + day_offset days + hour hours\n\n  Start date: 2017-10-08 00:00:00\n\n  We can use:\n\n      base_date = datetime(2017, 10, 8)\n      Then for day in range(4):\n          for hour in range(24):\n              date_str = (base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n  But note: we are adding hours? Actually, we can do:\n\n      for i in range(96):\n          current_date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n          then format to string.\n\n  And the value = hourly_avg[i % 24]\n\n 38. We output the data.\n\n 39. We write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 40. Let's do it.\n",
