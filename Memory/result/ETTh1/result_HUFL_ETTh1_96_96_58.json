        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (with 24-hour periodicity). The pattern includes:\n    - Higher values during the night (from 00:00 to around 08:00) and then a drop during the day (from 09:00 to 17:00) and then a rise again in the evening.\n    - However, the pattern on 2017-02-20 is different (it has positive values during the day, which might be an anomaly or a different pattern for a weekday?).\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast the next 96 (4 days), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the constraints and the fact that we are to provide a complete data without missing values, we must not omit any content, we need to generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model. One straightforward approach is to use the last available cycle (i.e., the last 24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the pattern might change. Alternatively, we can take the average of the four days we have for each hour of the day and then use that as the pattern for the next four days.\n\n 5. However, we note that the data has a trend? Let's check the last day (2017-02-21) and compare with the previous days.\n\n    - On 2017-02-18: \n        Night: around 11-13, then day: drops to negative, then evening: rises to 6-9, then night: 12.994\n    - On 2017-02-19: \n        Night: 10-11, then day: drops to negative, then evening: 6-8, then night: 11.119\n    - On 2017-02-20: \n        This day is different: the day values are positive (from 6 to 9) and the night is around 10-12.\n    - On 2017-02-21: \n        Night: 10-11, then day: positive (from 4.756 to 5.090 then a drop to -2.612 and then back to 3, then 2.6, then 6, then 9,8,8,7,8,10.65)\n\n 6. Given the variability, it might be better to use the average of the same hour over the four days we have.\n\n    We can group by the hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean for each hour.\n\n 7. But note: the data on 2017-02-20 is different: it has positive values during the day. This might be because it was a weekday? \n    However, we don't have information about weekdays vs weekends. Since we are to forecast the next 4 days, which are from Wednesday to Saturday (if 2017-02-18 is Saturday, then 2017-02-22 is Wednesday, 2017-02-23 Thursday, 2017-02-24 Friday, 2017-02-25 Saturday).\n\n    Let's the pattern on the weekend (2017-02-18 and 2017-02-19) vs weekday (2017-02-20 and 2017-02-21)?\n\n    Actually, 2017-02-18: Saturday, 2017-02-19: Sunday, 2017-02-20: Monday (a holiday? because the pattern is different) or maybe not. \n\n    Since we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only 4 days), we will stick to daily seasonality.\n\n 8. Approach: \n    - We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data on 2017-02-20 is an outlier? But we have to include it because we don't have much data.\n\n 9. Steps for averaging:\n\n    We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We can create a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours). Then, for each hour (column) we compute the mean.\n\n    But note: the last day (2017-02-21) has 24 hours? Yes, from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n 10. Let's create the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (11.521 + 10.382 + 12.860 + 10.784) / 4\n        hour1: (12.927 + 11.119 + 11.922 + 10.449) / 4\n        ... and so on.\n\n 11. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days) we will repeat this average pattern 4 times.\n\n 12. However, we must consider that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We can also consider using the last day's pattern if we suspect a change? But the problem says to forecast the next 96.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete data, we will use the hourly average method.\n\n 14. But note: the data has missing values? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing? So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 15. Let's calculate the hourly means:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then take the average.\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): [11.521, 10.382, 12.860, 10.784] -> mean = (11.521+10.382+12.860+10.784)/4 = 11.38675\n        Hour 1 (01:00): [12.927, 11.119, 11.922, 10.449] -> (12.927+11.119+11.922+10.449)/4 = 11.60425\n        ... and so on.\n\n 16. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-02-22): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day 2 (2017-02-23): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day 3 (2017-02-24): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day 4 (2017-02-25): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n\n 17. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 18. The last date in the given data is 2017-02-21 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-02-22 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n 19. We'll compute the hourly averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 20. Let's do the calculation for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list of the 4 values for each hour and then compute the mean.\n\n 21. However, note: the data on 2017-02-20 is different. But without more context, we have to use the average.\n\n 22. We'll write a small code in our mind (or use Python if we were coding, but since we are not, we do manually for each hour? but 24 hours, we can do it).\n\n    Alternatively, we can note that the average might be a reasonable estimate.\n\n 23. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour00: [11.521, 10.382, 12.860, 10.784] -> 11.38675\n        hour01: [12.927, 11.119, 11.922, 10.449] -> 11.60425\n        hour02: [13.262, 11.454, 12.927, 10.449] -> 12.023\n        hour03: [12.257, 9.712, 10.047, 9.578] -> 10.3985\n        hour04: [11.855, 10.918, 11.721, 10.851] -> 11.33625\n        hour05: [13.865, 10.784, 10.181, 10.449] -> 11.31975\n        hour06: [13.195, 11.320, 11.052, 10.449] -> 11.504\n        hour07: [13.798, 13.061, 12.994, 13.664] -> 13.37925\n        hour08: [9.310, 10.382, 8.908, 11.655] -> 10.06375\n        hour09: [4.756, 5.090, 6.095, 8.640] -> 6.14525\n        hour10: [0.000, 0.000, 7.703, 4.756] -> 3.11475   [Note: the second day 10:00 is 0.000?

Now, we have 24 average values for the hours. We will repeat these 24 values 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n 25. The dates: \n        Start: 2017-02-22 00:00:00\n        Then: 2017-02-22 01:00:00 ... until 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n 26.

We must output the data in the same way as the input, with the same precision (3 decimal places? the input had 3 decimal places).\n\n 28. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Let's list the 24 averages rounded to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour00: 11.387\n        hour01: 11.604\n        hour02: 12.023\n        hour03: 10.399\n        hour04: 11.336\n        hour05: 11.320\n        hour06: 11.504\n        hour07: 13.379\n        hour08: 10.064\n        hour09: 6.145\n        hour10: 3.115\n        hour11: 1.959\n        hour12: -2.411\n        hour13: -0.435\n        hour14: 0.787\n        hour15: 1.223\n        hour16: 4.437\n        hour17: 7.719\n        hour18: 8.289\n        hour19: 8.707\n        hour20: 8.188\n        hour21: 7.586\n        hour22: 8.958\n        hour23: 11.203\n\n 30. Now, we write the above 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 31. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-22 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-02-23 00:00:00 to 2017-02-23 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-02-24 00:00:00 to 2017-02-24 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-02-25 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00\n\n 32. We write the data in the required answer format.\n\n 33. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ```\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00 11.387\n        2017-02-22 01:00:00 11.604\n        ... \n        ```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 34. We'll write the 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 35. Let's note: the input data had the date format as \"2017-02-18 00:00:00\" and then the value without any comma? But in the example, it was separated by space. However, the example had:\n\n        \"2017-02-18 00:00:00 11.521\"\n\n    But the problem says: \"date   HUFL\" and then the data. So we output: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <value>\"\n\n 36. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 37. We must be cautious: the next day after 2017-02-21 is 2017-02-22.\n\n 38. We write the forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-22\n        Hour00: 11.387\n        Hour01: 11.604\n        ... until hour23: 11.203\n\n        Then Day2: 2017-02-23: same 24 values again.\n\n        And so on.\n\n 39. We output 96 lines.\n\n 40.
