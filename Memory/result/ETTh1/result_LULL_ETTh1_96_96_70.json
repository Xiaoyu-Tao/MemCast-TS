        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-07 00:00:00 to 2017-04-10 23:00:00) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 96 consecutive hours).\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we have to generate the timestamps and the forecasted LULL values.\n\n Approach for forecasting:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a model that can capture the daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and any trend.\n Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n However, note that the data is for a transformer and the load might have weekly patterns too, but we only have 4 days (less than a week) so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n We can use a model like:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last available day (or the same hour from the previous day) as the forecast.\n   - But note: the pattern from day to day might not be exactly the same. We see some variation.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components.\n\n Given the constraints and the fact that we are to provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n   Option 1: Use a seasonal naive model by taking the average of the same hour over the available 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (since 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours).\n\n   Option 2: Use an automated model like Prophet or SARIMA. But since we are in a constrained environment and must output exactly 96 points, we can use a simple method.\n\n However, note the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided data, there are no missing values, so we can proceed.\n\n Considering simplicity and the requirement to provide the complete data, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Check for any missing values in the provided data? -> None in the given 96 points.\n\n   Step 2: We can compute the average pattern for a day (24 hours) by averaging the 4 days we have.\n\n   But note: the data starts on 2017-04-07 (Friday) and ends on 2017-04-10 (Monday). So we have:\n        Day 1: Friday (2017-04-07)\n        Day 2: Saturday (2017-04-08)\n        Day 3: Sunday (2017-04-09)\n        Day 4: Monday (2017-04-10)\n\n   The next 4 days would be:\n        Day 5: Tuesday (2017-04-11)\n        Day 6: Wednesday (2017-04-12)\n        Day 7: Thursday (2017-04-13)\n        Day 8: Friday (2017-04-14)\n\n   Since we don't have a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday (except the first day was Friday) in the training, we cannot do a direct same-day average.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the overall average for each hour of the day.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n   Then, we will use that average pattern and repeat it for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n   However, note that the pattern might change by day of the week. But we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n   So we have to rely on the available 4 days.\n\n   We can also consider a weighted average where we give more weight to the most recent days? But without more data, we'll do a simple average.\n\n   Steps for the average method:\n\n        For hour h (0<=h<=23):\n            avg_h = (LULL_h of day1 + LULL_h of day2 + LULL_h of day3 + LULL_h of day4) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (2017-04-11 to 2017-04-14), for each hour h in [0,23] for each day, we set the forecast to avg_h.\n\n   But note: the data on Monday (2017-04-10) might be different from Friday, Saturday, Sunday. And we are forecasting Tuesday to Friday.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (Monday) as the pattern for Tuesday? But that might not be accurate.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we choose the average method.\n\n   However, let's look at the data: \n        The values on Monday (2017-04-10) are generally lower than the previous days? \n\n        Example at 00:00: \n            Friday: 1.036\n            Saturday: 0.731\n            Sunday: 0.792\n            Monday: 1.462   -> this is an outlier? \n\n        Actually, Monday 00:00 is 1.462, which is higher. So the average for 00:00 would be (1.036+0.731+0.792+1.462)/4 = 4.021/4 = 1.00525.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the data on Monday 00:00 is 1.462, which is the first hour of Monday. It might be that the pattern is shifting.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for each hour.\n\n   Given the time and the requirement, we'll do the simple average.\n\n   We'll generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Create an array `avg_hour` of length 24.\n\n        For hour in 0..23:\n            values = [ value at that hour from each of the 4 days ]\n            avg_hour[hour] = round(sum(values) / 4, 3)\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00), we assign:\n            day1 (2017-04-11): avg_hour[0] to avg_hour[23]\n            day2 (2017-04-12): avg_hour[0] to avg_hour[23]\n            day3 (2017-04-13): avg_hour[0] to avg_hour[23]\n            day4 (2017-04-14): avg_hour[0] to avg_hour[23]\n\n   But note: the last provided timestamp is 2017-04-10 23:00:00 (which is Monday 23:00). The next timestamp is 2017-04-11 00:00:00 (Tuesday).\n\n   We'll generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the average might smooth out the pattern and not capture the recent drop on Monday? \n\n   But without a more sophisticated model, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? But the data doesn't have extreme outliers (except the Monday 00:00 is high, but it's only one point).\n\n   We'll stick to the average.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: [1.036, 0.731, 0.792, 1.462] -> (1.036+0.731+0.792+1.462)/4 = 4.021/4 = 1.00525 -> 1.005\n        Hour 1: [1.492, 0.883, 0.701, 1.401] -> (1.492+0.883+0.701+1.401)/4 = 4.477/4 = 1.11925 -> 1.119\n        Hour 2: [1.340, 0.944, 0.822, 1.371] -> (1.340+0.944+0.822+1.371)/4 = 4.477/4 = 1.11925 -> 1.119\n        Hour 3: [1.340, 0.883, 0.822, 1.310] -> (1.340+0.883+0.822+1.310)/4 = 4.355/4 = 1.08875 -> 1.089\n        Hour 4: [1.340, 0.944, 0.822, 1.310] -> (1.340+0.944+0.822+1.310)/4 = 4.416/4 = 1.104 -> 1.104\n        Hour 5: [1.432, 1.066, 0.914, 1.492] -> (1.432+1.066+0.914+1.492)/4 = 4.904/4 = 1.226 -> 1.226\n        Hour 6: [1.492, 1.036, 0.853, 1.432] -> (1.492+1.036+0.853+1.432)/4 = 4.813/4 = 1.20325 -> 1.203\n        Hour 7: [1.675, 1.218, 1.127, 1.432] -> (1.675+1.218+1.127+1.432)/4 = 5.452/4 = 1.363 -> 1.363\n        Hour 8: [1.279, 1.249, 1.340, 1.127] -> (1.279+1.249+1.340+1.127)/4 = 4.995/4 = 1.24875 -> 1.249\n        Hour 9: [1.249, 1.279, 1.371, 1.279] -> (1.249+1.279+1.371+1.279)/4 = 5.178/4 = 1.2945 -> 1.295\n        Hour 10: [1.310, 1.249, 1.523, 1.127] -> (1.310+1.249+1.523+1.127)/4 = 5.209/4 = 1.30225 -> 1.302\n        Hour 11: [1.127, 1.066, 1.492, 1.036] -> (1.127+1.066+1.492+1.036)/4 = 4.721/4 = 1.18025 -> 1.180\n        Hour 12: [1.005, 1.218, 1.432, 1.218] -> (1.005+1.218+1.432+1.218)/4 = 4.873/4 = 1.21825 -> 1.218\n        Hour 13: [1.097, 1.310, 1.340, 1.127] -> (1.097+1.310+1.340+1.127)/4 = 4.874/4 = 1.2185 -> 1.219\n        Hour 14: [1.249, 1.218, 1.462, 1.066] -> (1.249+1.218+1.462+1.066)/4 = 4.995/4 = 1.24875 -> 1.249\n        Hour 15: [1.249, 1.218, 1.462, 1.066] -> same as hour14?
