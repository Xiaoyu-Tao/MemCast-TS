        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any missing values? \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But the provided sample does not have missing values? \n    Since the problem says \"will have\", it might be that in the future 96 points we are to forecast, we must account for the possibility? \n    But the instruction is to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must generate 96 points without any missing values.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points. Given the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours), we can use a time series method that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast the next 96 points (next 4 days), we can use a model with daily seasonality (seasonality period = 24).\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model. However, note that the data has negative values and fluctuations.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we are not provided with any other information, we can use a method like:\n    - Seasonal Naive: where the forecast for a given hour is the value of the same hour in the last available day (or average of same hour over past few days?).\n    - But note: the data shows a pattern that is not exactly repeating. Also, there might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n\n 7. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? \n    So we can proceed to model without handling missing values in the training data. But for forecasting, we must produce 96 consecutive points.\n\n 8. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. The format should be the same as the input: a datetime index and the MUFL value.\n\n 9. We are to output in the exact format:\n\n        <answer>\n        [datetime] [value]\n        ...\n        </answer>\n\n 10. Since we are an expert, we choose a robust method. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need for seasonality, we can use:\n\n     - Method: We will use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component by repeating the last season and adjusting with a simple trend.\n\n     However, note that 4 days is very short. Another idea: use the average of each hour over the 4 days as the seasonal component and then assume the level is the last day's level? \n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n     But let's check: the data from 2017-04-11 to 2017-04-14 (4 days). Then we want to forecast 2017-04-15 to 2017-04-18 (also 4 days).\n\n     However, the pattern might be changing. We can also consider a weighted average where the last day has more weight.\n\n 12. We can do:\n\n     Let H_i be the hour of the day (0 to 23). For each H_i, we compute:\n\n        forecast(H_i) = (w1 * day1[H_i] + w2 * day2[H_i] + w3 * day3[H_i] + w4 * day4[H_i]) / (w1+w2+w3+w4)\n\n     We can set weights to be increasing: e.g., [1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6] for the four days (from oldest to most recent). \n\n 13. But note: the data shows a possible downward trend? Let's see:\n\n        Day1 (2017-04-11): min -14.25, max 12.40\n        Day2: min -19.58, max 10.30\n        Day3: min -19.54, max 10.41\n        Day4: min -21.28, max 9.42\n\n     The minimums are getting lower? But then again, we have only 4 days. \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days without weighting? \n\n 15. We'll try the simple average and then adjust by the overall trend of the last day? \n\n 16. However, the problem does not require a complex model. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n 17. Let's do:\n\n     Step 1: Decompose the time series into level, trend, seasonality? But with 4 days, it's hard.\n\n 18. We choose: for each hour in the day, we take the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n     Then we forecast the next 4 days by repeating this average pattern 4 times? \n\n     But that would be too static. We can adjust by the last day's overall level? \n\n 19. We can compute the average of each day:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Similarly for Day2, Day3, Day4.\n\n     Then we see the trend? \n\n        Day1: mean = (10.163+10.874+...+5.615)/24 -> we can compute quickly? Actually, we don't need the exact mean, but the relative change.\n\n     Alternatively, we can compute the daily mean and then adjust the seasonal pattern by the change in the daily mean.\n\n 20. Steps:\n\n     a) Compute the daily mean for each of the 4 days.\n     b) Compute the seasonal indices (for each hour) as the average of (hour_value / daily_mean) for that hour over the 4 days.\n     c) Then, forecast the next daily mean by a simple method (like linear extrapolation of the daily means? or just use the last day's mean? or moving average?).\n     d) Then, for each day in the forecast, the hour H_i = forecast_daily_mean * seasonal_index[H_i]\n\n 21. But we have only 4 days, so the daily mean might be volatile.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the last day's mean as the base and then apply the seasonal indices? \n\n 23. Let me compute the daily means for the given days:\n\n        Day1 (2017-04-11): \n            sum = 10.163+10.874+10.163+10.341+8.528+9.346+12.402+9.026+8.457+3.802+3.020-5.650-4.620-14.250-3.411+0.142+0.355+0.249+4.087+4.833+4.691+4.158+5.117+5.615\n            = 10.163+10.874+10.163+10.341+8.528+9.346+12.402+9.026+8.457+3.802+3.020-5.650-4.620-14.250-3.411+0.142+0.355+0.249+4.087+4.833+4.691+4.158+5.117+5.615\n            Let me calculate step by step:\n\n            Positive: 10.163+10.874=21.037; +10.163=31.2; +10.341=41.541; +8.528=50.069; +9.346=59.415; +12.402=71.817; +9.026=80.843; +8.457=89.3; +3.802=93.102; +3.020=96.122; \n            Then negatives: -5.650 -> 96.122-5.650=90.472; -4.620=85.852; -14.250=71.602; -3.411=68.191; \n            Then positive: +0.142=68.333; +0.355=68.688; +0.249=68.937; +4.087=73.024; +4.833=77.857; +4.691=82.548; +4.158=86.706; +5.117=91.823; +5.615=97.438.\n\n            So mean1 = 97.438 / 24 = 4.0599\n\n        Day2 (2017-04-12): \n            We have: 8.280,8.848,8.315,7.995,6.965,7.569,10.305,8.884,4.762,1.492,-8.564,-19.580,-17.306,-16.062,-15.138,-12.544,-7.604,-0.533,3.482,4.442,4.655,4.975,5.792,5.366\n            Sum = 8.280+8.848+8.315+7.995+6.965+7.569+10.305+8.884+4.762+1.492-8.564-19.580-17.306-16.062-15.138-12.544-7.604-0.533+3.482+4.442+4.655+4.975+5.792+5.366\n\n            Positive: 8.280+8.848=17.128; +8.315=25.443; +7.995=33.438; +6.965=40.403; +7.569=47.972; +10.305=58.277; +8.884=67.161; +4.762=71.923; +1.492=73.415; \n            Then negatives: -8.564 -> 73.415-8.564=64.851; -19.580=45.271; -17.306=27.965; -16.062=11.903; -15.138=-3.235; -12.544=-15.779; -7.604=-23.383; -0.533=-23.916;\n            Then positive: +3.482=-20.434; +4.442=-15.992; +4.655=-11.337; +4.975=-6.362; +5.792=-0.57; +5.366=4.796.\n\n            So mean2 = 4.796 / 24 = 0.1998\n\n        Day3 (2017-04-13): \n            Values: 10.412,8.138,9.310,9.843,9.097,9.239,10.376,6.503,-0.497,-10.234,-13.574,-16.915,-19.544,-13.468,-15.706,-11.442,-7.747,-0.391,3.198,4.087,4.584,3.838,3.553,6.467\n            Sum = 10.412+8.138+9.310+9.843+9.097+9.239+10.376+6.503-0.497-10.234-13.574-16.915-19.544-13.468-15.706-11.442-7.747-0.391+3.198+4.087+4.584+3.838+3.553+6.467\n\n            Positive: 10.412+8.138=18.55; +9.310=27.86; +9.843=37.703; +9.097=46.8; +9.239=56.039; +10.376=66.415; +6.503=72.918; \n            Then negatives: -0.497=72.421; -10.234=62.187; -13.574=48.613; -16.915=31.698; -19.544=12.154; -13.468=-1.314; -15.706=-17.02; -11.442=-28.462; -7.747=-36.209; -0.391=-36.6;\n            Then positive: +3.198=-33.402; +4.087=-29.315; +4.584=-24.731; +3.838=-20.893; +3.553=-17.34; +6.467=-10.873.\n\n            So mean3 = -10.873 / 24 = -0.4530\n\n        Day4 (2017-04-14): \n            Values: 9.026,8.173,7.569,7.747,7.676,9.417,9.061,3.553,-0.497,-10.803,-14.711,-17.270,-21.285,-17.163,-17.270,-10.661,-4.015,-0.036,2.665,4.904,5.295,6.503,7.427,7.320\n            Sum = 9.026+8.173+7.569+7.747+7.676+9.417+9.061+3.553-0.497-10.803-14.711-17.270-21.285-17.163-17.270-10.661-4.015-0.036+2.665+4.904+5.295+6.503+7.427+7.320\n\n            Positive: 9.026+8.173=17.199; +7.569=24.768; +7.747=32.515; +7.676=40.191; +9.417=49.608; +9.061=58.669; +3.553=62.222; \n            Then negatives: -0.497=61.725; -10.803=50.922; -14.711=36.211; -17.270=18.941; -21.285=-2.344; -17.163=-19.507; -17.270=-36.777; -10.661=-47.438; -4.015=-51.453; -0.036=-51.489;\n            Then positive: +2.665=-48.824; +4.904=-43.92; +5.295=-38.625; +6.503=-32.122; +7.427=-24.695; +7.320=-17.375.\n\n            So mean4 = -17.375 / 24 = -0.72396\n\n     The daily means: [4.0599, 0.1998, -0.4530, -0.72396] -> showing a downward trend? But we have only 4 points, so we can use a linear trend? \n\n     Let's fit a line: \n        x = [0,1,2,3] for the 4 days, y = [4.0599, 0.1998, -0.4530, -0.72396]\n\n        We can use linear regression: \n            slope = (n*sum(xy) - sum(x)*sum(y)) / (n*sum(x^2) - (sum(x))^2)\n            intercept = (sum(y) - slope*sum(x)) / n\n\n        n=4\n        sum(x) = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n        sum(y) = 4.0599+0.1998-0.4530-0.72396 = 3.08274\n        sum(xy) = 0*4.0599 + 1*0.1998 + 2*(-0.4530) + 3*(-0.72396) = 0 + 0.1998 - 0.906 - 2.17188 = -2.87808\n        sum(x^2) = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n        slope = (4*(-2.87808) - 6*3.08274) / (4*14 - 6^2) = (-11.51232 - 18.49644) / (56-36) = (-30.00876) / 20 = -1.500438\n        intercept = (3.08274 - (-1.500438)*6) / 4 = (3.08274 + 9.002628) / 4 = 12.085368 / 4 = 3.021342\n\n        Then the next 4 days (x=4,5,6,7) would have:\n            day5: y5 = -1.500438*4 + 3.021342 = -6.001752 + 3.021342 = -2.98041\n            day6: y6 = -1.500438*5 + 3.021342 = -7.50219 + 3.021342 = -4.480848\n            day7: y7 = -1.500438*6 + 3.021342 = -9.002628 + 3.021342 = -5.981286\n            day8: y8 = -1.500438*7 + 3.021342 = -10.503066 + 3.021342 = -7.481724\n\n     But note: the trend is decreasing and the values are becoming more negative. However, we must check if this is reasonable? \n     Also, the seasonal pattern: we can compute the seasonal indices.\n\n 24. Compute the seasonal indices (hourly) by:\n\n        For each hour i (0-23):\n            s_i = ( (day1[i]/mean1) + (day2[i]/mean2) + (day3[i]/mean3) + (day4[i]/mean4) ) / 4\n\n     But note: if the mean is negative, then the ratio might be negative and the average might be distorted? \n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use an additive model? \n\n     In additive model:\n        y_t = level + trend + seasonality + noise\n\n     We can compute the seasonal component for each hour by:\n\n        (day1[i] - mean1) + (day2[i] - mean2) + (day3[i] - mean3) + (day4[i] - mean4) \n        then divide by 4.\n\n     Then for the forecast day j (from day5 to day8, which are the next 4 days), the hour i would be:\n\n        y_{j,i} = (intercept + slope * (j+3)) + seasonal_component[i]\n\n     But note: our x for the linear trend: \n        day1: x=0 -> mean1\n        day2: x=1 -> mean2\n        day3: x=2 -> mean3\n        day4: x=3 -> mean4\n        day5: x=4 -> y5 = intercept + slope*4\n\n     However, we have the intercept and slope from the linear regression? Actually, we have:\n        intercept = 3.021342, slope = -1.500438\n\n     But note: the linear regression was on the daily means. \n\n 26. Steps for additive model:\n\n        For each hour i (0 to 23):\n            seasonal_index[i] = ( (day1[i] - mean1) + (day2[i] - mean2) + (day3[i] - mean3) + (day4[i] - mean4) ) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (indexed by j=4,5,6,7 for the daily mean level = intercept + slope * j)\n\n        Then the forecast for hour i in day j (where j=4,5,6,7) is:\n            forecast = (intercept + slope * j) + seasonal_index[i]\n\n 27. However, note: the daily mean we are using for the entire day is the level? \n\n 28. Let's compute the seasonal indices for each hour:\n\n        We have:\n          mean1 = 4.0599\n          mean2 = 0.1998\n          mean3 = -0.4530\n          mean4 = -0.72396\n\n        For hour0 (00:00):\n          day1: 10.163, day2: 8.280, day3: 412, day4: 9.026 -> wait, day3 hour0 is 10.412? \n          So:\n            s0 = ( (10.163 - 4.0599) + (8.280 - 0.1998) + (10.412 - (-0.4530)) + (9.026 - (-0.72396)) ) / 4\n                = (6.1031 + 8.0802 + 10.865 + 9.74996) / 4\n                = 34.79826 / 4 = 8.699565\n\n        Similarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\n 29. Then for the next (day5, which is 2017-04-15, j=4) the level = intercept + slope*4 = 3.021342 -1.500438*4 = 3.021342 - 6.001752 = -2.98041\n\n        Then hour0 of day5: -2.98041 + 8.699565 = 5.719155\n\n        Then hour1: \n            day1 hour1: 10.874, day2:8.848, day3:8.138, day4:8.173\n            s1 = ( (10.874-4.0599) + (8.848-0.1998) + (8.138+0.4530) + (8.173+0.72396) ) / 4\n                = (6.8141 + 8.6482 + 8.591 + 8.89696) / 4 = 32.95026 / 4 = 8.237565\n\n        Then hour1 of day5: -2.98041 + 8.237565 = 5.257155\n\n     And so on.\n\n 30. But note: the seasonal indices are computed from the deviations. We are assuming the seasonal pattern is stable.\n\n 31. However, we must be cautious: the means are becoming negative and the additive model might not be the best? \n     But the data has negative values and the daily means are negative for the last two days, so multiplicative model might not be suitable because of negative values.\n\n 32. We'll proceed with the additive model.\n\n 33. We must compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours.\n\n 34. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. So we can compute.\n\n 35. We'll code the computation:\n\n     Let:\n        day1 = [10.163,10.874,10.163,10.341,8.528,9.346,12.402,9.026,8.457,3.802,3.020,-5.650,-4.620,-14.250,-3.411,0.142,0.355,0.249,4.087,4.833,4.691,4.158,5.117,5.615]\n        day2 = [8.280,8.848,8.315,7.995,6.965,7.569,10.305,8.884,4.762,1.492,-8.564,-19.580,-17.306,-16.062,-15.138,-12.544,-7.604,-0.533,3.482,4.442,4.655,4.975,5.792,5.366]\n        day3 = [10.412,8.138,9.310,9.843,9.097,9.239,10.376,6.503,-0.497,-10.234,-13.574,-16.915,-19.544,-13.468,-15.706,-11.442,-7.747,-0.391,3.198,4.087,4.584,3.838,3.553,6.467]\n        day4 = [9.026,8.173,7.569,7.747,7.676,9.417,9.061,3.553,-0.497,-10.803,-14.711,-17.270,-21.285,-17.163,-17.270,-10.661,-4.015,-0.036,2.665,4.904,5.295,6.503,7.427,7.320]\n\n        means = [4.0599, 0.1998, -0.4530, -0.72396]\n\n        seasonal_index = [0]*24\n        for i in range(24):\n            s = ( (day1[i]-means[0]) + (day2[i]-means[1]) + (day3[i]-means[2]) + (day4[i]-means[3]) ) / 4.0\n            seasonal_index[i] = s\n\n     Then for the next 4 days (day5 to day8, which are 4 days starting at 2017-04-15 00:00:00), we do:\n\n        for j in range(4,8)]:   # j=4,5,6,7\n            level = intercept + slope * j\n            for i in range(24):\n                value = level + seasonal_index[i]\n                # record the datetime: \n                # first forecast point: 2017-04-15 00:00:00 (which is next after 2017-04-14 23:00:00)\n\n     How to generate the datetime? \n        The last date in the input is 2017-04-14 23:00:00. \n        The next date is 2017-04-15 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n\n 36. We'll generate 96 points.\n\n 37. But note: the linear trend we computed is for the daily mean. We are using the same seasonal index for each day? \n     Yes, because we don't have weekly seasonality? We only have 4 days.\n\n 38. Let's compute the seasonal_index:\n\n        We'll do it manually for the first few and then we can write a program? But since we are to provide the data, we can compute all.\n\n     However, we are to output the data. We can do the computation in code? But we are in text.

The input had 3 decimal places. \n     But the problem says \"complete data\", so we'll output with 6 decimal places? But the example input had 3. \n     However, the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" -> so we'll output as float with 6 decimals? \n\n     But note: the input had 3.020000, so we can output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 46. We'll generate the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-04-15 00:00:00 5.719155\n        2017-04-15 01:00:00 5.257155\n        ... \n\n 47. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide complete data. \n     So we are generating 96 points without missing.\n\n 48. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 49. However, note: the linear trend we computed is very steep and the level becomes very negative. \n     This might lead to negative values for the forecasted points? But that's what the model says.\n\n 50. We'll proceed.\n\n 51. We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 52. We'll do:\n\n        dates = []\n        values = pd.date_range(start='2017-04-15 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n        for j in range(4):   # j from 0 to 3, representing the 4 forecast days (which are j=4,5,6,7 in our linear model index)\n            level = intercept + slope * (4+j)   # because the first forecast day is j=4, then 5,6,7\n            for i in range(24):\n                value = level + seasonal_index[i]\n                # append the value\n\n        But note: our j in the linear model: \n            day5: j=4 -> index in the loop: j=0 -> we use 4+0=4\n            day6: j=1 -> 4+1=5\n            day7: j=2 -> 4+2=6\n            day8: j=3 -> 4+3=7\n\n 53. We'll compute:\n\n        day5: level4 = -2.98041\n        day6: level5 = -4.480848\n        day7: level6 = -5.981286\n        day8: level7 = -7.481724\n\n 54. Then for each hour i in [0,23] for day5, then day6, etc.\n\n 55. We'll generate the data.\n\n 56. But note: the seasonal_index we computed is a list of 24 values.\n\n 57. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n 58. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide complete data. \n     So we are generating 96 points without missing.\n\n 59. We'll output.\n\n 60. But note: the model might not be the best, but given the constraints and the data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 61. Let's output the first 2 days (48 points) and last 2 days? But we must output all 96.\n\n 62. We'll do the entire 96 points.\n\n 63. We'll write a text block.\n\n 64. We note: the values might be negative and fractional.\n\n 65. We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 66. We'll generate:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-04-15 00:00:00 5.719155\n        2017-04-15 01:00:00 5.257155\n        ... until 2017-04-18 23:00:00\n\n 67. We'll do the computation for all 96.\n\n 68.

We'll generate all.\n\n 71. We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 72. But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must not omit any.\n\n 73.
