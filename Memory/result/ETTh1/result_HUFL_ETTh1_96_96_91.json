        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-06-30 00:00:00 to 2017-07-03 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 points, but we are to be cautious.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values?\n    We are to forecast the next 96, and we must provide complete data for the next 96.\n\n 2. Since we are to forecast, we must choose a model. Given the hourly data and the possibility of multiple seasonality (daily, weekly),\n    we can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with multiple seasons), or even a simple approach if the data is not too complex.\n\n 3. However, note that the data has some negative values (e.g., on 2017-07-02 15:00:00: -5.693) and fluctuations.\n\n 4. We are to provide the next 96 points. We must generate the timestamps and the forecasted values.\n\n 5. Due to the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models that require extensive computation or libraries that are not available.\n    We'll use a simple but effective method: Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n 6. But note: the data might have more than one seasonality? However, with only 96 points (4 days) we cannot capture weekly seasonality (which would require at least a week of data, i.e., 168 points).\n    So we'll stick to daily seasonality (24 periods).\n\n 7. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n    - We have additive or multiplicative? The seasonality in the data does not seem to change in amplitude dramatically, but we see negative values so multiplicative might not be suitable (since it requires positive data). \n    - We choose additive.\n\n 8. However, the data has a negative value? That is acceptable for additive seasonality.\n\n 9. We'll use the last 96 points to fit the model and forecast the next 96.\n\n 10. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't see any. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 11. We'll use the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-07-03 23:00:00) and then hourly until 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n 12. Implementation in Python code (if we were to run it) would be:\n\n     from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing\n     import pandas as pd\n\n     # Read the data (provided as string, we would parse)\n     data = ... # the given 96 points\n\n     # Fit model\n     model = ExponentialSmoothing(data['HUFL'], seasonal='add', seasonal_periods=24)\n     fit = model.fit()\n     forecast = fit.forecast(96)\n\n 13. However, we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code. Therefore, we must simulate the output.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: \n      - We can use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 15. Since we cannot run the model, we have to provide a placeholder. But note: the problem says we are an expert and must provide the data.\n\n 16. We must generate the next 96 timestamps and then the forecasted values.\n\n 17. How about we use a naive method: the last observed day (2017-07-03) as the forecast for the next day? But we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) and we have 4 days of history.\n\n 18. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? \n\n     Steps for averaging:\n        - We have 4 days: 2017-06-30, 2017-07-01, 2017-07-02, 2017-07-03.\n        - For hour 00:00:00: average of [10.449, 9.109, 7.435, 11.052] -> (10.449+9.109+7.435+11.052)/4 = 9.26125\n        - Similarly for each hour (0 to 23) and then repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 19. But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the first day and the last day: \n        Day1: 2017-06-30: [10.449, 8.707] (min: 2.880, max: 11.052)\n        Day2: 2017-07-01: [9.109, 5.961] (min: 3.081, max: 11.052)\n        Day3: 2017-07-02: [7.435, 7.100] (min: -5.693, max: 9.310)\n        Day4: 2017-07-03: [11.052, 7.770] (min: -2.679, max: 11.052)\n\n     There is no clear trend, but we see some negative values on day3 and day4. \n\n 20. The average might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 21. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then the next 96 hours (4 days) will be that average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 22. How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (10.449 + 9.109 + 7.435 + 11.052) / 4 = 9.51125\n        hour1: (9.377 + 9.779 + 7.368 + 10.717) / 4 = 9.31025\n        ... and so on.\n\n 23. But note: the data for the same hour across days might be missing? In our case, we have all 4 days for each hour? Yes, 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 24. We'll compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) and then use that as the forecast for each day in the next 4 days.\n\n 25. However, the problem says we must be aware of missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can do this.\n\n 26. Let's do the calculation for each hour:\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n 27. Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n\n        Day0: 2017-06-30 00:00:00 -> 10.449\n        Day1: 2017-07-01 00:00:00 -> 9.109\n        Day2: 2017-07-02 00:00:00 -> 7.435\n        Day3: 2017-07-03 00:00:00 -> 11.052\n        Average = (10.449 + 9.109 + 7.435 + 11.052) / 4 = 9.51125\n\n 28. Similarly, for hour1 (01:00:00):\n\n        Day0: 9.377\n        Day1: 9.779\n        Day2: 7.368\n        Day3: 10.717\n        Average = (9.377+9.779+7.368+10.717)/4 = 9.31025\n\n 29. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 30. Then the next 4 days (2017-07-04 to 2017-07-07) will have:\n\n        Day1 (2017-07-04): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day2 (2017-07-05): same as above ]\n        Day3 (2017-07-06): same\n        Day4 (2017-07-07): same\n\n 31. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-04 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-04 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We'll compute the 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 33. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to capture weekly. And the next 4 days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? \n     The historical data: \n        2017-06-30: Friday\n        2017-07-01: Saturday\n        2017-07-02: Sunday\n        2017-07-03: Monday\n\n     The next 4 days: \n        2017-07-04: Tuesday\n        2017-07-05: Wednesday\n        2017-07-06: Thursday\n        2017-07-07: Friday\n\n     We don't capturing weekly seasonality because we only have one week? and the days of the week are not the same.\n\n 34. Given the limited data, we stick to daily pattern.\n\n 35. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour00: (10.449, 9.109, 7.435, 11.052) -> 9.51125\n        hour01: (9.377, 9.779, 7.368, 10.717) -> 9.31025\n        hour02: (9.042, 9.846, 6.765, 9.846) -> 8.87475\n        hour03: (8.306, 8.975, 7.167, 9.846) -> 8.574\n        hour04: (7.904, 8.975, 6.832, 7.100) -> 7.70275\n        hour05: (9.042, 11.052, 8.439, 9.444) -> 9.49425\n        hour06: (11.052, 10.784, 8.908, 9.980) -> 10.181\n        hour07: (9.176, 10.114, 8.841, 8.105) -> 9.059\n        hour08: (6.631, 7.971, 9.310, 6.162) -> 7.5185\n        hour09: (6.229, 8.774, 8.573, 2.143) -> 6.42975\n        hour10: (6.296, 9.109, 8.038, 3.215) -> 6.6645\n        hour11: (5.693, 9.243, 5.827, -2.679) -> 4.521\n        hour12: (8.172, 7.301, 6.698, 0.670) -> 5.71025\n        hour13: (8.372, 3.885, 2.612, 0.201) -> 3.7675\n        hour14: (2.880, 3.081, 3.751, 4.354) -> 3.5165\n        hour15: (3.349, 3.349, -5.693, -1.273) -> -0.067\n        hour16: (4.019, 6.363, -3.349, 4.287) -> 2.83\n        hour17: (4.622, 8.908, 4.153, 6.430) -> 6.02825\n        hour18: (6.229, 5.425, 6.631, 4.890) -> 5.79375\n        hour19: (6.698, 6.162, 6.899, 7.368) -> 6.78175\n        hour20: (7.033, 6.966, 7.234, 8.105) -> 7.3345\n        hour21: (6.631, 6.028, 7.167, 7.703) -> 6.88225\n        hour22: (7.167, 6.229, 6.832, 7.435) -> 6.91575\n        hour23: (8.707, 5.961, 7.100, 7.770) -> 7.3845\n\n 36. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-04: [9.51125, 9.31025, 8.87475, ... , 7.3845] (24 values)\n        Day2: 2017-07-05: same 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-07-06: same\n        Day4: 2017-07-07: same\n\n 37. But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data. We'll format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-04 00:00:00 9.511\n2017-07-04 01:00:00 9.310\n2017-07-04 02:00:00 8.875\n2017-07-04 03:00:00 8.574\n2017-07-04 04:00:00 7.703\n2017-07-04 05:00:00 9.494\n2017-07-04 06:00:00 10.181\n2017-07-04 07:00:00 9.059\n2017-07-04 08:00:00 7.519\n2017-07-04 09:00:00 6.430\n2017-07-04 10:00:00 6.664\n2017-07-04 11:00:00 4.521\n2017-07-04 12:00:00 5.710\n2017-07-04 13:00:00 3.768\n2017-07-04 14:00:00 3.516\n2017-07-04 15:00:00 -0.067\n2017-07-04 16:00:00 2.830\n2017-07-04 17:00:00 6.028\n2017-07-04 18:00:00 5.794\n2017-07-04 19:00:00 6.782\n2017-07-04 20:00:00 7.335\n2017-07-04 21:00:00 6.882\n2017-07-04 22:00:00 6.916\n2017-07-04 23:00:00 7.385\n2017-07-05 00:00:00 9.511\n2017-07-05 01:00:00 9.310\n... and so on until 2017-07-07 23:00:00\n\n 38. We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 39. However, note that the input has negative values and we have one negative in hour15. So we keep that.\n\n 40. We'll generate the next 96 lines.\n\n 41. We must be cautious: the last historical timestamp is 2017-07-03 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-07-04 00:00:00.\n\n 42. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 43. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we write all 96.\n\n 44. We'll format the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 45. Let's write the first day (2017-07-04) with the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals) and then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 46. The averages we computed above, we round:\n\n        hour00: 9.51125 -> 9.511\n        hour01: 9.31025 -> 9.310\n        hour02: 8.87475 -> 8.875\n        hour03: 8.574 -> 8.574\n        hour04: 7.70275 -> 7.703\n        hour05: 9.49425 -> 9.494\n        hour06: 10.181 -> 10.181\n        hour07: 9.059 -> 9.059\n        hour08: 7.5185 -> 7.519\n        because 7.5185 rounded to 3 decimals: 7.519? \n            The rule: 8 is above 5, so 7.5185 -> 7.519? \n            But note: 7.5185 * 1000 = 7518.5 -> round to integer: 7519 -> then 7.519\n        However, let's check: \n            The input has 3 decimals. We'll do the same.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimals: \n            round(9.51125, 3) -> 9.511\n            round(9.31025, 3) -> 9.310\n            round(8.87475, 3) -> 8.875\n            because 8.87475: the fourth decimal is 7, so round up the third: 8.875\n\n        Similarly, \n        hour09: 6.42975 -> 6.430\n        hour10: 6.6645 -> 6.665? \n            But 6.6645: the fourth decimal is 5 -> round up: 6.665? \n            However, note: the input has 3 decimals and we see they are truncated? or rounded? \n            We'll use standard rounding: round to even? but typically in such contexts we round to the nearest, and if exactly 0.0005, round to the next.\n\n        But to be consistent, we'll use: \n            value = round(avg, 3)\n\n        Let's do:\n\n        hour00: round(9.51125, 3) = 9.511\n        hour01: round(9.31025, 3) = 9.310\n        hour02: round(8.87475, 3) = 8.875\n        because 8.87475: the third decimal is 4, the next is 7 -> so 8.875\n        hour03: 8.574 -> 8.574\n        hour04: 7.70275 -> 7.703\n        hour05: 9.49425 -> 9.494\n        hour06: 10.181 -> 10.181\n        hour07: 9.059 -> 9.059\n        hour08: 7.5185 -> 7.519\n        because 7.5185: the third decimal is 8, and the next is 5 -> so we look at the fourth: 5 -> then we round up the third decimal: 8 becomes 9? \n        Actually: 7.5185: \n            digits: 7.5185\n            third decimal is 8, and then 5 -> so we round the 8 up? \n            But the rule: we round the digit in the thousandths place: \n                7.5185: \n                    thousandths: 8, and the next digit is 5 -> so we round up the 8 to 9 -> 7.519\n\n        hour09: 6.42975 -> \n            thousandths: 9, and next digit 7 -> so we round up the 9 -> becomes 10 -> so 6.430\n        hour10: 6.6645 -> \n            thousandths: 4, next digit 5 -> round up to 5 -> 6.665\n        But wait: 6.6645: \n            The number is 6.6645, rounding to 3 decimals: \n                We look at the fourth decimal: 5 -> so we round up the third decimal: 4 becomes 5 -> 6.665\n\n        However, let me check with an example: \n            The input has 6.229, 5.693, etc. They are given to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll do the same: round to 3 decimals.\n\n        So:\n\n        hour00: 9.511\n        hour01: 9.310\n        hour02: 8.875\n        hour03: 8.574\n        hour04: 7.703\n        hour05: 9.494\n        hour06: 10.181\n        hour07: 9.059\n        hour08: 7.519\n        hour09: 6.430   [because 6.42975 -> 6.430? \n            Actually: 6.42975: \n                The third decimal is 9, the next is 7 -> so we round up the 9: 9+1=10 -> so 6.430 (because 6.429 + 0.001 = 6.430) \n        hour10: 6.665   [6.6645 -> 6.665]\n        hour11: 4.521   [4.521 -> 4.521]\n        hour12: 5.71025 -> 5.710\n        hour13: 3.7675 -> 3.768\n        hour14: 3.5165 -> 3.517\n        hour15: -0.067 -> -0.067\n        hour16: 2.83 -> 2.830? but wait: 2.83 is 2.830? \n            Actually: 2.83 is the same as 2.830. But we have 2.83 from the average? \n            We computed: 2.83 -> that is 2.83000 -> so 2.830? \n            But we must write 3 decimals: so 2.830.\n\n        However, our average was 2.83 exactly? \n            (4.019+6.363-3.349+4.287) = (4.019+6.363=10.382; 10.382-3.349=7.033; 7.033+4.287=11.32) -> 11.32/4=2.83 -> so 2.830\n\n        hour17: 6.02825 -> 6.028\n        hour18: 5.79375 -> 5.794\n        hour19: 6.78175 -> 6.782\n        hour20: 7.3345 -> 7.335\n        hour21: 6.88225 -> 6.882\n        hour22: 6.91575 -> 6.916\n        hour23: 7.3845 -> 7.385\n\n 47. So the 24 values for one day:\n\n        hour00: 9.511\n        hour01: 9.310\n        hour02: 8.875\n        hour03: 8.574\n        hour04: 7.703\n        hour05: 9.494\n        hour06: 10.181\n        hour07: 9.059\n        hour08: 7.519\n        hour09: 6.430\n        hour10: 6.665\n        hour11: 4.521\n        hour12: 5.710\n        hour13: 3.768   [because 3.7675 -> 3.768]\n        hour14: 3.517   [3.5165 -> 3.517]\n        hour15: -0.067\n        hour16: 2.830\n        hour17: 6.028\n        hour18: 5.794\n        hour19: 6.782\n        hour20: 7.335\n        hour21: 6.882\n        hour22: 6.916\n        hour23: 7.385\n\n 48. Now we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n 49. We generate the timestamps:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-04\n        Day2: 2017-07-05\n        Day3: 2017-07-06\n        Day4: 2017-07-07\n\n 50. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 51. We must be cautious: the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 52. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-04 00:00:00 9.511\n2017-07-04 01:00:00 9.310\n2017-07-04 02:00:00 8.875\n... \n2017-07-07 23:00:00 7.385\n\n 53. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 54. Let's do the first two days and the last two lines to check.\n\n 55. We'll code the pattern in the answer.\n\n 56. Since we cannot run code, we do it manually.\n\n 57. We'll list the 24 values for one day (as above) and then repeat 4 times.\n\n 58. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n 59. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
