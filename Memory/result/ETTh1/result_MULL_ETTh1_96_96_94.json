        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missingness in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are consecutive and without gaps. But for forecasting, we must be prepared to handle any missingness in the future? Actually, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided past 96 are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we need to generate the timestamps and the forecasted MULL values.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series model that can handle hourly data and capture daily seasonality (since there appears to be a daily pattern).\n    - Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend.\n\n    However, note that the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history.\n\n 5. Considering the constraints, we are not told the exact model to use, but we can choose a simple model that works with short time series and seasonality.\n\n    Options:\n      - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality: but the seasonal period is 24 (for hourly data with daily seasonality). However, with only 4 seasons (days) of data, it might be challenging.\n      - SARIMA: similarly, we would need to set seasonal period to 24, but with only 4 days, the model might not be very stable.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n        - The last 24 hours pattern repeated? But the data does not look exactly repeating.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the short history, we might use a simple average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But note: the data starts on 2017-07-12 (Wednesday) and goes to 2017-07-15 (Saturday). \n    The next 96 hours would be from 2017-07-16 (Sunday) to 2017-07-19 (Wednesday). So we are going from a Wednesday-Saturday pattern to Sunday-Wednesday. There might be weekly seasonality, but we don't have enough data for that.\n\n 7. Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture the daily pattern by averaging each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each day? But that would ignore the trend and the day-of-week effect.\n\n    However, note that the data does not have a clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-07-12): values from -1.67 to 3.41\n        Day 2 (2017-07-13): from -1.49 to 0.82\n        Day 3 (2017-07-14): from -1.56 to 2.59\n        Day 4 (2017-07-15): from -1.95 to 2.34\n\n    The pattern is not consistent. \n\n 8. Given the challenge, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the level and then apply the daily seasonality.\n\n    We can decompose the series into a level and a seasonal component. Since we have 4 days, we can compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the same hour across the 4 days and then subtract the overall mean to get the seasonal component. Then, we can forecast the level by taking the average of the last few points (or the entire series) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n    Steps for a simple decomposition model:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the overall average (mean) of the entire 96 points: `total_mean`.\n        Step 2: For each hour of the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour across the 4 days: `hourly_avg[i]`.\n        Step 3: The seasonal index for hour i: `seasonal_index[i] = hourly_avg[i] - total_mean`.\n        Step 4: The level of the series: we can use the total_mean as the base level? Or we can use the average of the last day? \n\n        However, note that the level might be changing. We can compute the daily average for each day and then use the last day's average as the base level? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the entire series and then adjust by the seasonal indices to get the level for each day? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            For each day, let the daily level = average of the day's 24 hours.\n            Then, we can take the average of the 4 daily levels? or use the last day's level?\n\n        Since we are forecasting the next 4 days, we can use the last day's level (2017-07-15) as the base level for the forecast? \n\n        Then, the forecast for hour i of the next j-th day (j=0 to 3) would be: \n            base_level + seasonal_index[i]\n\n        But we don't have a trend, so we assume the level remains constant.\n\n        How to set the base_level? \n            Option 1: the average of the entire series -> then we are ignoring recent changes.\n            Option 2: the average of the last day (2017-07-15) -> then we are using the most recent level.\n\n        Let's try Option 2.\n\n        Step 5: For each hour i (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, the forecast is:\n            forecast = (average of the last day) + seasonal_index[i]\n\n        But note: the seasonal_index[i] is computed as (average of hour i over 4 days) - total_mean.\n\n        Then: \n            forecast = (last_day_avg) + [ hourly_avg[i] - total_mean ]\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the seasonal indices without subtracting the total_mean? Actually, the classical decomposition uses:\n\n            We have: observation = level + seasonal + noise\n\n            So we estimate the seasonal indices as the average deviation for that hour from the overall mean.\n\n        Then, if we assume the level for the next day is the last day's average, then the forecast for hour i is:\n\n            forecast = (last_day_avg) + (hourly_avg[i] - total_mean)\n\n        But note: the last_day_avg already includes the seasonal pattern? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            We first remove the seasonal effect from the last day? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different approach: \n\n            We compute the seasonal indices (as the average for each hour over the 4 days) and then normalize them so that they average to zero? \n\n        Let me recast:\n\n            Let S_i = average of hour i over the 4 days.\n            Then the seasonal indices s_i = S_i - total_mean, and the sum of s_i over 24 hours should be zero? \n\n            But note: the average of the 24 S_i is the total_mean, so the average of s_i is 0.\n\n        Then, the level for a day is the average of the day's 24 observations without the seasonal effect. \n\n        For the last day, the level L = last_day_avg - (average of the seasonal indices for the last day) \n            but note: the average of the seasonal indices for a day is the average of s_i for i=0..23, which is 0.\n\n        So the level for the last day is just last_day_avg? \n\n        Then, the model for the last day is: \n            For hour i: L + s_i = last_day_avg + s_i\n\n        But wait, that would be: last_day_avg + (S_i - total_mean)\n\n        And the last day's actual average is the average of (L + s_i) for i in 0,23] = L + (average of s_i) = L.\n\n        So we have L = last_day_avg.\n\n        Then the forecast for a future day (with the same level L) at hour i is: L + s_i = last_day_avg + (S_i - total_mean)\n\n        But note: we are using the same level for the next 4 days? \n\n        However, we don't have a trend, so we assume the level remains at last_day_avg.\n\n 9. Let's compute:\n\n        total_mean = mean of all 96 points.\n\n        Then, for each hour (0 to 23), we compute:\n            S_i = (value at hour i of day1 + day2 + day3 + day4) / 4\n\n        Then, s_i = S_i - total_mean.\n\n        Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days, starting at 2017-07-16 00:00:00), we set:\n\n            For day 1 (2017-07-16): \n                hour0: last_day_avg + s_0\n                hour1: last_day_avg + s_1\n                ... \n\n            Similarly for the next 3 days.\n\n 10. But note: the last day (2017-07-15) had a level that we are using. However, if there is a weekly pattern, then Sunday (2017-07-16) might be different from Saturday (2017-07-15). But we don't have data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 11. Given the data limitation, we proceed with daily seasonality only.\n\n 12. Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to output the data.\n\n     We'll compute:\n\n        total_mean = (sum of all 96 values) / 96\n\n        last_day_avg = average of the last 24 values (from 2017-07-15 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00)\n\n        Then, for each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute S_i by:\n\n            hour0: average of the 4 values at 00:00:00 (2017-07-12, 2017-07-13, 2017-07-14, 2017-07-15)\n            ... similarly for other hours.\n\n        Then, s_i = S_i - total_mean\n\n        Then, for each of the next 4 days (2017-07-16, 2017-07-17, 2017-07-18, 2017-07-19), for each hour i:\n\n            forecast = last_day_avg + s_i\n\n 13. However, note: the last day (2017-07-15) is a Saturday, and the next day (2017-07-16) is a Sunday. We are using the same level and same seasonal indices? \n\n     This method does not account for weekly seasonality, but we don't have enough data to capture weekly patterns (only 4 days, which are Wednesday to Saturday). \n\n 14. We must generate the timestamps for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-16 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-07-15 23:00:00)\n        Then: 2017-07-16 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n\n 15. Let's do the calculations:\n\n     First, compute total_mean:\n\n        We have 96 data points. We can sum them and divide by 96.\n\n        Sum = \n            (-0.178) + (-1.315) + ... + (0.391)   [the last value]\n\n        We can do it step by step? But we are an AI, so we can compute.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write a small program, but we are to output the answer.\n\n        However, we are to provide the forecast without showing the intermediate calculations.\n\n        We'll compute the necessary values:\n\n        total_mean = (sum of the 96 values) / 96\n\n        Let me calculate the sum:\n\n            We can group by day? But it's 96 numbers.

We are forecasting without missing values? We are to provide the complete data.\n\n     However, we are forecasting the next 96 points without missing values.\n\n 16. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: \"date\" and \"MULL\", with the timestamp and the value.\n\n 17. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. But the computation has more. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        For example: 0.0136663333 -> 0.014 (if rounded to 3 decimals) -> but let's do proper rounding.\n\n        Actually, the input had 3 decimal places, so we'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll round each forecast to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Example: \n            0.0136663333 -> 0.014\n            0.0314163333 -> 0.031\n            ... \n\n        We'll use standard rounding.\n\n 18. Let's round the forecasts for each hour:\n\n        Hour0: 0.0136663333 -> 0.014\n        Hour1: 0.0314163333 -> 0.031\n        Hour2: 0.0316663333 -> 0.032\n        Hour3: -0.3415836667 -> -0.342\n        Hour4: -0.4038336667 -> -0.404\n        Hour5: -0.8483336667 -> -0.848\n        Hour6: -1.1143336667 -> -1.114\n        Hour7: -0.6168336667 -> -0.617\n        Hour8: -0.5903336667 -> -0.590\n        Hour9: -0.8565836667 -> -0.857\n        Hour10: 0.5999163333 -> 0.600\n        Hour11: 0.3424163333 -> 0.342\n        Hour12: 0.6354163333 -> 0.635\n        Hour13: 1.1506663333 -> 1.151\n        Hour14: 1.1864163333 -> 1.186\n        Hour15: 0.6444163333 -> 0.644\n        Hour16: -0.0840836667 -> -0.084\n        Hour17: -0.8748336667 -> -0.875\n        Hour18: -1.4698336667 -> -1.470\n        Hour19: -1.6030836667 -> -1.603\n        Hour20: -1.1768336667 -> -1.177\n        Hour21: -0.9365836667 -> -0.937\n        Hour22: -0.4038336667 -> -0.404\n        Hour23: 0.0671663333 -> 0.067\n\n 19. Now, we write the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-16 00:00:00\n        Then: 2017-07-16 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 21. Note: The method we used is very basic and does not account for any trend or weekly seasonality. But given the data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 22. We output the data in the answer block.\n\n 23. We note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output all 96 lines.\n\n 24. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-16 00:00:00 0.014\n2017-07-16 01:00:00 0.031\n2017-07-16 02:00:00 0.032\n... up to 2017-07-19 23:00:00 0.067 (for the last hour of each day)\n\n        </answer>\n\n 25. But note: the last day (2017-07-19) will have the same pattern as the first forecast day.\n\n 26. We generate the timestamps:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-16 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        Day2: 2017-07-17 00:00:00 to 2017-07-17 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-07-18 00:00:00 to 2017-07-18 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-07-19 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00\n\n 27. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 28. We must be cautious: the rounding might cause slight inaccuracies, but it's standard.\n\n 29. Let's write the data.\n",
