        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given segment, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n 3. We must generate 96 forecasted values starting from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast without any additional information about the missing values in the provided data (and the given 96 points are complete), we can proceed with a time series model.\n\n Given the nature of the data (hourly, with potential daily seasonality) and the relatively short history (4 days), we can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any)\n   - Seasonality (daily: 24 hours)\n\n However, note that the last day (2016-12-31) has constant temperature (10.904) for all 24 hours, which is unusual. This might be an anomaly or due to missing values that have been filled with a constant? But the problem says the data has missing values and we must be aware. Since we are only given 96 points and they are complete, we will use them as is.\n\n We can use a simple seasonal model. Given the short history, we might consider:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day.\n   - But note: the last day (2016-12-31) is constant, so if we use the last day as the seasonal pattern, we would get a constant forecast. However, that might not be realistic.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days for each hour? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Let's break down the data:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-12-28): values from 6.261 to 9.356 then down to 7.879\n   Day 2 (2016-12-29): 7.175 to 9.426 then down to 7.035\n   Day 3 (2016-12-30): 6.613 to 13.155 then down to 11.256\n   Day 4 (2016-12-31): constant 10.904\n\n The constant on 2016-12-31 is suspicious. It might be an artifact of missing data? But we are told to be aware of missing values, and the provided data is complete. So we must use it.\n\n However, for forecasting, we cannot rely solely on the last day because it is constant. We might consider using the average of the last 3 days for each hour? But note that the pattern on 2016-12-30 is very different (much higher temperatures).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that uses multiple seasonal patterns. But with only 4 days, it's challenging.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   - Use the average of the same hour for the previous 3 non-constant days? But the last day is constant and might be an outlier.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2016-12-31) as the base, but adjust it by the trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n   - Another idea: use the median of the same hour for the previous 3 days? But the constant day will dominate.\n\n   - Since the problem says the data has missing values, and we are to be aware, but the provided 96 points are complete, we can assume that the constant day is an anomaly and use the previous days (excluding the constant day) for the seasonal pattern.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify how to handle the provided data's missing values. We are only given 96 points and they are complete.\n\n   Considering the above, I will use:\n\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the first three days (2016-12-28, 2016-12-29, 2016-12-30) and ignore the constant day (2016-12-31) because it is an obvious anomaly.\n\n   Why ignore 2016-12-31?\n        The temperature is constant at 10.904 for 24 hours, which is not typical for a transformer that shows variation in the previous days.\n\n   So, we will compute the hourly average for the first three days and use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days? But note: we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days). So we can repeat the same daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n   Steps for forecasting:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the day:\n            forecast_h = (value of hour h on 2016-12-28 + value of hour h on 2016-12-29 + value of hour h on 2016-12-30) / 3\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2016-12-30 has a peak that is much higher than the previous two. This might be due to a higher load or an event. By averaging, we are smoothing that.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use the median to avoid the effect of extreme days? But we only have three days.\n\n   Let's try with the average and see if the values look reasonable.\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n\n        2016-12-28: 6.261\n        2016-12-29: 7.175\n        2016-12-30: 6.613\n        average = (6.261 + 7.175 + 6.613) / 3 = 20.049 / 3 = 6.683\n\n   Similarly, for hour 14 (14:00:00):\n\n        2016-12-28: 9.919\n        2016-12-29: 9.215\n        2016-12-30: 13.155\n        average = (9.919 + 9.215 + 13.155) / 3 = 32.289 / 3 = 10.763\n\n   This seems reasonable.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not given any in the 96 points, so we assume the provided segment is complete.\n\n   However, the problem also says \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". Since we are only given 96 points and they are complete, we don't need to impute in the history. But for forecasting, we are generating the next 96 without missing.\n\n   Therefore, we will generate 96 points by repeating the daily pattern (computed as the average of the first three days) for 4 days.\n\n   The forecast will start at 2017-01-01 00:00:00 and go to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n   We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (6.261 + 7.175 + 6.613) / 3 = 6.683\n        hour1: (6.472 + 7.316 + 6.613) / 3 = 6.800333 -> 6.800\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll compute all 24 hourly averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n   However, note: the provided data has 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). We are using the first 3 days to compute the pattern and ignoring the 4th day because it is constant and likely an anomaly.\n\n   But what if the constant day is not an anomaly? The problem doesn't specify. However, it is highly unlikely for a transformer to have constant temperature for 24 hours. Therefore, we proceed.\n\n   We'll compute the hourly averages for the 24 hours from the first three days.\n\n   Let's do the computation:\n\n        Hour 0: (6.261 + 7.175 + 6.613) / 3 = 6.683\n        Hour 1: (6.472 + 7.316 + 6.613) / 3 = (6.472+7.316+6.613)=20.401/3=6.800333 -> 6.800\n        Hour 2: (5.979 + 8.231 + 6.402) / 3 = (5.979+8.231+6.402)=20.612/3=6.870667 -> 6.871\n        Hour 3: (6.472 + 8.301 + 5.768) / 3 = (6.472+8.301+5.768)=20.541/3=6.847\n        Hour 4: (6.613 + 8.934 + 5.417) / 3 = (6.613+8.934+5.417)=20.964/3=6.988\n        Hour 5: (5.346 + 7.879 + 5.065) / 3 = (5.346+7.879+5.065)=18.29/3=6.096667 -> 6.097\n        Hour 6: (6.402 + 7.457 + 5.698) / 3 = (6.402+7.457+5.698)=19.557/3=6.519\n        Hour 7: (5.276 + 7.597 + 4.924) / 3 = (5.276+7.597+4.924)=17.797/3=5.932333 -> 5.932\n        Hour 8: (6.753 + 8.231 + 4.432) / 3 = (6.753+8.231+4.432)=19.416/3=6.472\n        Hour 9: (6.542 + 8.442 + 5.487) / 3 = (6.542+8.442+5.487)=20.471/3=6.823667 -> 6.824\n        Hour10: (5.979 + 7.809 + 6.964) / 3 = (5.979+7.809+6.964)=20.752/3=6.917333 -> 6.917\n        Hour11: (7.105 + 8.160 + 7.949) / 3 = (7.105+8.160+7.949)=23.214/3=7.738\n        Hour12: (7.527 + 7.597 + 8.864) / 3 = (7.527+7.597+8.864)=23.988/3=7.996\n        Hour13: (8.864 + 7.597 + 11.818) / 3 = (8.864+7.597+11.818)=28.279/3=9.426333 -> 9.426\n        Hour14: (9.919 + 9.215 + 13.155) / 3 = (9.919+9.215+13.155)=32.289/3=10.763\n        Hour15: (7.668 + 8.371 + 12.381) / 3 = (7.668+8.371+12.381)=28.42/3=9.473333 -> 9.473\n        Hour16: (7.738 + 8.090 + 12.100) / 3 = (7.738+8.090+12.100)=27.928/3=9.309333 -> 9.309\n        Hour17: (9.004 + 9.004 + 11.889) / 3 = (Wait, note: 2016-12-29 17:00 is 9.004, 2016-12-30 17:00 is 11.889, and 2016-12-28 17:00 is 9.004) -> (9.004+9.004+11.889)=29.897/3=9.965667 -> 9.966\n        Hour18: (9.215 + 9.426 + 10.974) / 3 = (9.215+9.426+10.974)=29.615/3=9.871667 -> 9.872\n        Hour19: (9.286 + 9.075 + 10.693) / 3 = (9.286+9.075+10.693)=29.054/3=9.684667 -> 9.685\n        Hour20: (9.356 + 8.723 + 10.200) / 3 = (9.356+8.723+10.200)=28.279/3=9.426333 -> 9.426\n        Hour21: (9.075 + 8.231 + 10.904) / 3 = (9.075+8.231+10.904)=28.21/3=9.403333 -> 9.403\n        Hour22: (9.075 + 8.020 + 10.904) / 3 = (9.075+8.020+10.904)=27.999/3=9.333\n        Hour23: (7.879 + 7.035 + 11.256) / 3 = (7.879+7.035+11.256)=26.17/3=8.723333 -> 8.723\n\n   Now, we have 24 values for the daily pattern.\n\n   We will repeat this pattern 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n   The forecast dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-01 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-01 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n   We generate the dates by starting from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 and adding 1 hour for 96 steps.\n\n   Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-01-01 00:00:00 -> 6.683\n        2017-01-01 01:00:00 -> 6.800\n        2017-01-01 02:00:00 -> 6.871\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-01 00:00:00  6.683\n2017-01-01 01:00:00  6.800\n2017-01-01 02:00:00  6.871\n...
