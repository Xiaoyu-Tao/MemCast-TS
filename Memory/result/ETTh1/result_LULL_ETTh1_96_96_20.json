        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-19 00:00:00 to 2016-09-22 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load is higher during the day and lower at night.\n 2. We note that the data might have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. However, for forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input. Since the given data is complete, we proceed.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can capture seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality of 24, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. We need to determine the parameters (p, d, q) and seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, s) where s=24.\n\n However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days). This is a very short time series for fitting a SARIMA model with daily seasonality (which requires at least 2 seasons to estimate the seasonal component). Therefore, we might consider a simpler model.\n\n Alternative approach:\n - Since the data is short, we can use a moving window of the same hours from previous days. For example, to forecast the 00:00:00 of 2016-09-23, we can take the average of the 00:00:00 values of the past 4 days (if available) or use the last available same hour.\n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that repeats every day, but the level might change. We can also consider a naive seasonal model: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day. However, we have 4 days of data, so we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23) for the next 4 days (so 4*24=96 hours):\n      Let h be the hour (0 to 23) and let d be the day index (0: 2016-09-19, 1: 2016-09-20, 2: 2016-09-21, 3: 2016-09-22)).\n      We want to forecast for day 4 (2016-09-23) to day 7 (2016-09-26). \n\n   We can do:\n      For the first forecast day (2016-09-23, day4): \n          hour 0: average of 2016-09-19 00:00, 2016-09-20 00:00, 2016-09-21 00:00, 2016-09-22 00:00\n          hour 1: average of 2016-09-19 01:00, ... and so on.\n\n      But note: the data for 2016-09-20 00:00 is 1.462, 2016-09-21 00:00 is 0.731, 2016-09-22 00:00 is 1.432, and 2016-09-19 00:00 is 0.792. The average for hour0 would be (0.792+1.462+0.731+1.432)/4 = 1.10425.\n\n   However, for the next day (2016-09-24, day5) we don't have the same hour of the previous day (because we are forecasting). So we can do:\n      Option 1: Use the same average for each day? But that would make the forecast for all 4 days the same for the same hour. That might be too simplistic and ignore the trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a drift or a simple moving average of the last few days for that hour? But we only have 4 days.\n\n   Another idea: use the last available same hour and adjust by the average change between consecutive days? But we have very limited data.\n\n   Given the constraints, we can do:\n      For the first day of forecast (2016-09-23), we use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n      For the second day (2016-09-24), we can use the same average? Or we can use the average of the same hour from the past 3 days? But that would be arbitrary.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a seasonal naive method: use the same hour from the last day (2016-09-22) for the entire forecast period? But that would be constant for the 4 days? That doesn't account for any trend.\n\n   However, looking at the data, there is no clear trend over the 4 days. The values at the same hour vary. \n\n   Considering the short history, we can use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days for each of the next 4 days. This will give a forecast that repeats the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided data there are no missing values. So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n   Steps:\n      Step 1: Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n      Step 2: For the next 4 days (2016-09-23 to 2016-09-26), we assign for each hour the mean value computed for that hour.\n\n   However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Also, the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n   Let's check the daily average:\n        2016-09-19: average = (0.792+0.701+...+0.853)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            We can see the values: min ~0.64, max ~1.218 -> average around 0.9?\n        2016-09-20: starts at 1.462 and then goes down? average might be around 1.0?\n        2016-09-21: starts at 0.731 -> average around 0.9?\n        2016-09-22: starts at 1.432 -> average around 1.0?\n\n   The daily averages are not changing in a clear trend. Therefore, using the average per hour for the next 4 days is acceptable.\n\n   How to compute:\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and take the mean of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n   Example for hour0:\n        Day1: 0.792\n        Day2: 1.462\n        Day3: 0.731\n        Day4: 1.432\n        Mean = (0.792+1.462+0.731+1.432)/4 = 4.417/4 = 1.10425\n\n   Similarly for hour1:\n        Day1: 0.701\n        Day2: 1.401\n        Day3: 0.670\n        Day4: 1.492\n        Mean = (0.701+1.401+0.670+1.492)/4 = 4.264/4 = 1.066\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the same 24-hour pattern (the computed means) for each day.\n\n   So the forecast for:\n        2016-09-23 00:00:00 -> 1.10425\n        2016-09-23 01:00:00 -> 1.066\n        ... until 2016-09-23 23:00:00 -> [mean for hour23]\n\n        Then 2016-09-24 00:00:00 -> same as 2016-09-23 00:00:00? Actually, we use the same pattern: so again 1.10425 for 00:00:00 of 2016-09-24.\n\n   This means the forecast for the same hour of the day is constant across the 4 forecast days.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided data there are none, and we are only using the provided data. So we compute the means from the provided 4 days.\n\n   But what if there was a missing value? We are told to be aware of missing values, but in the given 96 points there are none. So we proceed.\n\n   Let's compute the mean for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [0.792, 1.462, 0.731, 1.432] -> mean = (0.792+1.462+0.731+1.432)/4 = 4.417/4 = 1.10425\n        hour1: [0.701, 1.401, 0.670, 1.492] -> (0.701+1.401+0.670+1.492)=4.264 -> 1.066\n        hour2: [0.731, 1.432, 0.579, 1.432] -> (0.731+1.432+0.579+1.432)=4.174 -> 1.0435\n        hour3: [0.701, 1.371, 0.579, 1.462] -> (0.701+1.371+0.579+1.462)=4.113 -> 1.02825\n        hour4: [0.640, 1.371, 0.609, 1.279] -> (0.640+1.371+0.609+1.279)=3.899 -> 0.97475\n        hour5: [0.761, 1.340, 0.670, 1.218] -> (0.761+1.340+0.670+1.218)=3.989 -> 0.99725\n        hour6: [0.822, 1.492, 0.822, 1.553] -> (0.822+1.492+0.822+1.553)=4.689 -> 1.17225\n        hour7: [1.066, 1.614, 0.975, 1.553] -> (1.066+1.614+0.975+1.553)=5.208 -> 1.302\n        hour8: [1.218, 1.249, 1.249, 1.066] -> (1.218+1.249+1.249+1.066)=4.782 -> 1.1955\n        hour9: [1.188, 1.371, 1.036, 1.066] -> (1.188+1.371+1.036+1.066)=4.661 -> 1.16525\n        hour10: [1.005, 1.249, 1.036, 1.036] -> (1.005+1.249+1.036+1.036)=4.326 -> 1.0815\n        hour11: [0.914, 1.127, 1.097, 1.005] -> (0.914+1.127+1.097+1.005)=4.143 -> 1.03575\n        hour12: [0.761, 0.944, 0.944, 0.822] -> (0.761+0.944+0.944+0.822)=3.471 -> 0.86775\n        hour13: [0.883, 0.853, 1.127, 0.853] -> (0.883+0.853+1.127+0.853)=3.716 -> 0.929\n        hour14: [0.975, 0.883, 1.005, 1.218] -> (0.975+0.883+1.005+1.218)=4.081 -> 1.02025\n        hour15: [0.883, 1.036, 1.097, 1.066] -> (0.883+1.036+1.097+1.066)=4.082 -> 1.0205\n        hour16: [0.944, 0.975, 0.944, 0.975] -> (0.944+0.975+0.944+0.975)=3.838 -> 0.9595\n        hour17: [0.761, 0.822, 0.853, 0.975] -> (0.761+0.822+0.853+0.975)=3.411 -> 0.85275\n        hour18: [0.792, 0.883, 0.883, 0.822] -> (0.792+0.883+0.883+0.822)=3.38 -> 0.845\n        hour19: [0.792, 0.975, 0.944, 0.731] -> (0.792+0.975+0.944+0.731)=3.442 -> 0.8605\n        hour20: [0.883, 0.792, 0.914, 0.761] -> (0.883+0.792+0.914+0.761)=3.35 -> 0.8375\n        hour21: [0.853, 0.761, 0.822, 0.731] -> (0.853+0.761+0.822+0.731)=3.167 -> 0.79175\n        hour22: [0.670, 0.822, 0.731, 0.670] -> (0.670+0.822+0.731+0.670)=2.893 -> 0.72325\n        hour23: [0.853, 0.822, 0.761, 0.640] -> (0.853+0.822+0.761+0.640)=3.076 -> 0.769\n\n   Then, the next 4 days (2016-09-23 to 2016-09-26) will have the same 24 values repeated for each day.\n\n   Format: We must output 96 rows, starting from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-23 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        Day 2: 2016-09-24 00:00:00 to 2016-09-24 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2016-09-25 00:00:00 to 2016-09-25 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2016-09-26 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00\n\n   And for each day, the values for the 24 hours are the same: the 24 means we computed.\n\n   We'll write the values with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   The input had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Let's round the computed means to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 1.10425 -> 1.104\n        hour1: 1.066 -> 1.066\n        hour2: 1.0435 -> 1.044\n        But note: 1.0435 rounded to 3 decimals is 1.044? \n        Actually, 1.0435 is exactly halfway?

However, we can round to 3 decimals by:\n            round(1.0435, 3) -> 1.044\n\n        We'll round each to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same precision as the input. The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me recalc and round:\n\n        hour0: 1.10425 -> 1.104\n        hour1: 1.066 -> 1.066\n        hour2: 1.0435 -> 1.044\n        hour3: 1.02825 -> 1.028\n        hour4: 0.97475 -> 0.975\n        hour5: 0.99725 -> 0.997\n        hour6: 1.17225 -> 1.172\n        hour7: 1.302 -> 1.302\n        hour8: 1.1955 -> 1.196? \n            Actually, 1.1955: rounding to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 1.196\n        hour9: 1.16525 -> 1.165\n        hour10: 1.0815 -> 1.082 (because 1.0815 -> 1.082? \n            Actually, 1.0815: the 4th digit is 5, so we round up the 3rd: 1.082)\n        hour11: 1.03575 -> 1.036\n        hour12: 0.86775 -> 0.868\n        hour13: 0.929 -> 0.929\n        hour14: 1.02025 -> 1.020\n        hour15: 1.0205 -> 1.021 (because 1.0205 -> 1.021? \n            Actually, 1.0205: the 4th digit is 5 -> round up the 3rd: 1.021)\n        hour16: 0.9595 -> 0.960\n        hour17: 0.85275 -> 0.853\n        hour18: 0.845 -> 0.845\n        hour19: 0.8605 -> 0.861\n        hour20: 0.8375 -> 0.838\n        hour21: 0.79175 -> 0.792\n        hour22: 0.72325 -> 0.723\n        hour23: 0.769 -> 0.769   (but 0.769 is already 3 decimals)\n\n   However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places and sometimes 2 or 3 digits after the decimal. We'll output 3 decimals.\n\n   But let me double-check the rounding:\n\n        hour8: 1.1955 -> 1.196 (correct: because 1.1955 rounded to 3 decimals: 1.196)\n        hour10: 1.0815 -> 1.082 (correct)\n        hour15: 1.0205 -> 1.021 (correct)\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 values (for hour0 to hour23) with these rounded values.\n\n   Then, we repeat this list 4 times (for the 4 days).\n\n   Now, we write the output in the required format.\n\n   Note: The date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We start at 2016-09-23 00:00:00 and go to 2016-09-26 23:00:00.\n\n   We must output 96 rows.\n\n   Let's code this in our mind:\n\n        base_date = \"2016-09-23\"\n        We'll generate 4 days.\n\n        For day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = base_date + day_offset days? \n                Specifically: \n                    day0: 2016-09-23\n                    day1: 2016-09-24\n                    day2: 2016-09-25\n                    day3: 2016-09-26\n\n        We can use:\n            from datetime import datetime, timedelta (but we were not asked to code, just to output)\n\n        We'll write the dates as:\n\n            day0: 2016-09-23 00:00:00, 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00\n            day1: 2016-09-24 00:00:00, ... \n            day2: 2016-09-25 ...\n            day3: 2016-09-26 ...\n\n   The values for each day are the same 24 numbers.\n\n   We'll list:\n\n        hour0: 1.104\n        hour1: 1.066\n        hour2: 1.044\n        hour3: 1.028\n        hour4: 0.975\n        hour5: 0.997\n        hour6: 1.172\n        hour7: 1.302\n        hour8: 1.196\n        hour9: 1.165\n        hour10: 1.082\n        hour11: 1.036\n        hour12: 0.868\n        hour13: 0.929\n        hour14: 1.020\n        hour15: 1.021\n        hour16: 0.960\n        hour17: 0.853\n        hour18: 0.845\n        hour19: 0.861\n        hour20: 0.838\n        hour21: 0.792\n        hour22: 0.723\n        hour23: 0.769\n\n   Then for each day, we output these 24 values in order.\n\n   So the first 24 rows (2016-09-23) are the above 24 values in order.\n\n   The next 24 rows (2016-09-24) are the same 24 values.\n\n   And so on.\n\n   We write the output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-09-23 00:00:00 1.104\n2016-09-23 01:00:00 1.066\n2016-09-23 02:00:00 1.044\n2016-09-23 03:00:00 1.028\n2016-09-23 04:00:00 0.975\n2016-09-23 05:00:00 0.997\n2016-09-23 06:00:00 1.172\n2016-09-23 07:00:00 1.302\n2016-09-23 08:00:00 1.196\n2016-09-23 09:00:00 1.165\n2016-09-23 10:00:00 1.082\n2016-09-23 11:00:00 1.036\n2016-09-23 12:00:00 0.868\n2016-09-23 13:00:00 0.929\n2016-09-23 14:00:00 1.020\n2016-09-23 15:00:00 1.021\n2016-09-23 16:00:00 0.960\n2016-09-23 17:00:00 0.853\n2016-09-23 18:00:00 0.845\n2016-09-23 19:00:00 0.861\n2016-09-23 20:00:00 0.838\n2016-09-23 21:00:00 0.792\n2016-09-23 22:00:00 0.723\n2016-09-23 23:00:00 0.769\n2016-09-24 00:00:00 1.104\n2016-09-24 01:00:00 1.066\n... and so on until 2016-09-26 23:00:00\n\n   We'll generate 4 days of the same pattern.\n\n   Let's write the complete 96 rows.\n\n   Note: We must not omit any.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n",
