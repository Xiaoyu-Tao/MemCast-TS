        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values.\n    However, for the purpose of forecasting, we must handle the given data and then produce 96 future points.\n\n 2. Since the data is time series with hourly frequency, we can use time series forecasting methods. Given the relatively short history (4 days) and the need for 4 days ahead, \n    we might consider methods like:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Exponential Smoothing\n    - Prophet by Facebook (if we had more data, but 4 days is very short for seasonal decomposition)\n    - Simple methods like using the average of the same hour in the past days, or a moving average.\n\n 3. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with higher values at night and lower during the day? \n      But looking at the data, the pattern is not very strong and there are negative values.\n\n 4. Given the short history, we might use a complex model but with caution. However, note that the data is only 4 days and we are to forecast 4 days.\n\n 5. We can try to use a simple approach: \n    - Since we have 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    - But note: the data does not be perfectly periodic. Also, the last day (2016-07-16) seems to have a different pattern.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model. We can automatically select the parameters (p, d, q) using auto_arima from the pmdarima library? \n    But note: we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code. We have to reason.\n\n 7. However, the problem says we are an expert, so we must provide the forecast. Since we cannot run code, we have to use a simple method.\n\n 8. Considering the constraints, we must provide 96 numbers. We can do:\n\n    Option 1: Use the last available day (2016-07-16) and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n        But the pattern might change? Also, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the given data there are none.\n\n    Option 2: Use the average of the four days for each hour.\n\n 9. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We can group by hour (0 to 23) and take the mean.\n\n    Example:\n        Hour 00: (4.015 + 2.878 + 2.097 + 0.782) / 4 = (4.015+2.878+2.097+0.782)=9.772/4=2.443\n        Hour 01: (3.411+2.985+1.954+1.670)/4 = (3.411+2.985+1.954+1.670)=10.02/4=2.505\n\n    But note: the data for the last day (2016-07-16) has a value at 00:00:00 of 0.782, which is lower than the previous days.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? But without more information, we use the simple average.\n\n 11. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n        Day 1 (07-13): average = (sum of 24 values) \n        We don't have to compute exactly, but visually: the first day has higher values at night and then drops, then the next days seem to have a decreasing trend?\n\n 12. Since we are only given 4 days, and we are to forecast 4 days, and without a clear trend, we might use the average.\n\n 13. Steps for the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the average of the same hour for the past 4 days.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says there might be missing values. In the provided data, we don't have missing values, so we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n 15. We must generate 96 data points: from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n 16. We will compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     Let's denote:\n        Hour 0: average of [2016-07-13 00:00:00, 2016-07-14 00:00:00, 2016-07-15 00:00:00, 2016-07-16 00:00:00]\n        Hour 1: average of [2016-07-13 01:00:00, ... , 2016-07-16 01:00:00]\n        ... and so on.\n\n 17. Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n        Day 1 (2016-07-17): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ..., avg_hour23]\n        Day 2 (2016-07-18): same as above\n        Day 3 (2016-07-19): same as above\n        Day 4 (2016-07-20): same as above\n\n 18. However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Also, the data does not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n 19. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n     Hour 0: [4.015, 2.878, 2.097, 0.782] -> (4.015+2.878+2.097+0.782)/4 = 9.772/4 = 2.443\n     Hour 1: [3.411, 2.985, 1.954, 1.670] -> (3.411+2.985+1.954+1.670) = 10.02 -> 2.505\n     Hour 2: [3.589, 2.132, 1.812, 1.990] -> (3.589+2.132+1.812+1.990)=9.523 -> 2.38075\n     Hour 3: [2.949, 2.985, 1.421, 1.599] -> (2.949+2.985+1.421+1.599)=8.954 -> 2.2385\n     Hour 4: [3.909, 1.706, 0.782, 1.066] -> (3.909+1.706+0.782+1.066)=7.463 -> 1.86575\n     Hour 5: [4.087, 1.990, 0.959, 0.959] -> (4.087+1.990+0.959+0.959)=7.995 -> 1.99875\n     Hour 6: [2.701, 2.274, 0.604, 0.782] -> (2.701+2.274+0.604+0.782)=6.361 -> 1.59025\n     Hour 7: [1.457, 1.137, 0.782, 0.355] -> (1.457+1.137+0.782+0.355)=3.731 -> 0.93275\n     Hour 8: [1.315, 1.599, 0.888, 0.711] -> (1.315+1.599+0.888+0.711)=4.513 -> 1.12825\n     Hour 9: [1.457, 1.279, 1.954, 0.320] -> (1.457+1.279+1.954+0.320)=5.01 -> 1.2525\n     Hour 10: [1.173, 1.173, 1.564, 0.959] -> (1.173+1.173+1.564+0.959)=4.869 -> 1.21725\n        Correction: The second value for hour10 is 1.173? Actually, the data for 2016-07-14 10:00:00 is 1.173? \n        Let me check: \n            2016-07-13 10:00:00: 1.173\n            2016-07-14 10:00:00: 1.173? Actually, the data says 1.173? \n            But in the provided data: \n                2016-07-14 10:00:00: 1.173 -> yes, same as the first day.\n\n        So: [1.173, 1.173, 1.564, 0.959] -> 1.173+1.173+1.564+0.959 = 4.869 -> 1.21725\n\n     Hour 11: [0.853, 0.782, 1.102, 0.995] -> (0.853+0.782+1.102+0.995)=3.732 -> 0.933\n     Hour 12: [0.426, 0.391, 0.391, 0.284] -> (0.426+0.391+0.391+0.284)=1.492 -> 0.373\n     Hour 13: [0.426, 0.853, 0.817, 0.355] -> (0.426+0.853+0.817+0.355)=2.451 -> 0.61275\n     Hour 14: [0.817, 0.782, 0.817, 1.208] -> (0.817+0.782+0.817+1.208)=3.624 -> 0.906\n     Hour 15: [0.995, 2.559, 1.066, 1.066] -> (0.995+2.559+1.066+1.066)=5.686 -> 1.4215\n     Hour 16: [0.924, 0.675, 0.782, 1.350] -> (0.924+0.675+0.782+1.350)=3.731 -> 0.93275\n     Hour 17: [0.782, -0.107, 0.497, 0.959] -> (0.782 -0.107 +0.497+0.959)=2.131 -> 0.53275\n     Hour 18: [0.604, -0.284, 0.000, 0.355] -> (0.604 -0.284 +0.000+0.355)=0.675 -> 0.16875\n     Hour 19: [0.604, 0.036, -0.036, -0.036] -> (0.604+0.036-0.036-0.036)=0.568 -> 0.142\n     Hour 20: [0.853, 0.036, 0.000, 0.000] -> (0.853+0.036+0.000+0.000)=0.889 -> 0.22225\n     Hour 21: [2.168, -0.426, 1.208, -0.355] -> (2.168 -0.426 +1.208 -0.355)=2.595 -> 0.64875\n     Hour 22: [1.599, -0.320, 0.959, 0.959] -> (1.599 -0.320 +0.959+0.959)=3.197 -> 0.79925\n     Hour 23: [2.843, 1.137, 1.528, 0.782] -> (2.843+1.137+1.528+0.782)=6.29 -> 1.5725\n\n 20. Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n     2016-07-17 00:00:00: 2.443\n     2016-07-17 01:00:00: 2.505\n     ... and so on for 24 hours of July 17, then repeat the same 24 numbers for July 18, 19, 20.\n\n 21. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points we don't have any, so we used all.\n\n 22. We must output the data in the same format, with the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted MULL.\n\n 23. We generate the timestamps:\n\n     The last given timestamp is 2016-07-16 23:00:00.\n     The next 96 hours:\n\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-07-17 23:00:00\n        2016-07-18 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-07-20 23:00:00\n\n 24. We'll create a list of 96 entries, with the MULL values being the 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n 25. However, we must note: the average for each hour is computed to 4 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimals as in the input.\n\n 26. Let's round the computed average to 3 decimal places.\n\n     Hour0: 2.443 -> 2.443\n     Hour1: 2.505 -> 2.505\n     Hour2: 2.38075 -> 2.381\n     Hour3: 2.2385 -> 2.239\n     Hour4: 1.86575 -> 1.866\n     Hour5: 1.99875 -> 1.999\n     Hour6: 1.59025 -> 1.590\n     Hour7: 0.93275 -> 0.933\n     Hour8: 1.12825 -> 1.128\n     Hour9: 1.2525 -> 1.253\n     Hour10: 1.21725 -> 1.217\n     Hour11: 0.933 -> 0.933\n     Hour12: 0.373 -> 0.373\n     Hour13: 0.61275 -> 0.613\n     Hour14: 0.906 -> 0.906\n     Hour15: 1.4215 -> 1.422\n     Hour16: 0.93275 -> 0.933\n     Hour17: 0.53275 -> 0.533\n     Hour18: 0.16875 -> 0.169\n     Hour19: 0.142 -> 0.142\n     Hour20: 0.22225 -> 0.222\n     Hour21: 0.64875 -> 0.649\n     Hour22: 0.79925 -> 0.799\n     Hour23: 1.5725 -> 1.573\n\n 27. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n     Day1: 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 23:00:00: [2.443, 2.505, 2.381, 2.239, 1.866, 1.999, 1.590, 0.933, 1.128, 1.253, 1.217, 0.933, 0.373, 0.613, 0.906, 1.422, 0.933, 0.533, 0.169, 0.142, 0.222, 0.649, 0.799, 1.573]\n     Then repeat the same list for the next three days.\n\n 28. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to capture weekly. Also, the problem does not specify the day of the week.\n\n 29. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 30. We must be cautious: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 31. We write the answer in the following format:\n\n<answer>\n\n```\n2016-07-17 00:00:00  2.443\n2016-07-17 01:00:00  2.505\n2016-07-17 02:00:00  2.381\n2016-07-17 03:00:00  2.239\n2016-07-17 04:00:00  1.866\n2016-07-17 05:00:00  1.999\n2016-07-17 06:00:00  1.590\n2016-07-17 07:00:00  0.933\n2016-07-17 08:00:00  1.128\n2016-07-17 09:00:00  1.253\n2016-07-17 10:00:00  1.217\n2016-07-17 11:00:00  0.933\n2016-07-17 12:00:00  0.373\n2016-07-17 13:00:00  0.613\n2016-07-17 14:00:00  0.906\n2016-07-17 15:00:00  1.422\n2016-07-17 16:00:00  0.933\n2016-07-17 17:00:00  0.533\n2016-07-17 18:00:00  0.169\n2016-07-17 19:00:00  0.142\n2016-07-17 20:00:00  0.222\n2016-07-17 21:00:00  0.649\n2016-07-17 22:00:00  0.799\n2016-07-17 23:00:00  1.573\n2016-07-18 00:00:00  2.443\n2016-07-18 01:00:00  2.505\n...

We'll write the first day, then the second day, then the fourth day.\n\n 34. Since it's repetitive, we can generate by repeating the list of 24 values 4 times.\n\n 35. We output the data.\n\n 36. Note: The timestamps must be consecutive and in the correct order.\n\n 37. We do it step by step.\n\n 38. We write the 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 39.
