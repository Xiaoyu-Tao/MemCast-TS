        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided data, we don't see any explicit missing values (like NaN). \n    However, we must be cautious. The provided data has 96 points (4 days * 24 hours = 96). We are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 2. Since the data is time series with an hourly frequency, we can consider using time series forecasting methods. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 steps ahead, \n    we need a method that can handle multiple seasonality and possibly trend. However, the data does not very long so complex models might not be feasible.\n\n 3. We observe that the data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours). Let's note the pattern:\n\n    - The values fluctuate throughout the day, with peaks and troughs.\n\n 4. Given the short history, we can use a simple model like:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the previous day) as the forecast for the next day. But note: the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n    However, we have 4 days of data. We can also try to take the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But note: the data starts at 2016-08-02 and ends at 2016-08-05.\n\n    The next 96 hours would be 2016-08-06, 2016-08-07, 2016-08-08, 2016-08-09.\n\n 5. But note: the data provided has 96 points (4 days). We can break it into 4 daily profiles.\n\n    Let's extract the daily profiles:\n\n    Day1: 2016-08-02: [3.215, 3.684, 3.885, 4.957, 5.023, 5.157, 4.354, 4.555, 4.220, 2.411, 3.215, 2.411, 2.411, 2.210, 1.474, 2.545, 1.875, 2.210, 1.541, 0.804, 1.541, 0.737, 2.009, 3.014]\n    Day2: 2016-08-03: [3.550, 3.148, 1.206, 0.938, 1.340, 0.268, 0.670, 1.808, 0.536, 1.206, -0.402, 1.005, 1.005, 0.938, 0.938, 0.938, 2.344, 3.751, 4.287, 3.349, 3.952, 3.148, 4.086, 4.957]\n    Day3: 2016-08-04: [4.622, 4.689, 3.751, 4.354, 3.952, 4.019, 4.287, 4.689, 4.823, 4.220, 4.622, 4.220, 3.483, 3.751, 3.282, 3.952, 3.952, 3.952, 3.885, 3.684, 3.684, 3.952, 4.086, 6.095]\n    Day4: 2016-08-05: [6.028, 5.492, 6.095, 5.626, 6.028, 5.626, 6.028, 6.966, 5.894, 5.157, 4.756, 5.224, 3.818, 4.488, 4.555, 3.818, 4.019, 4.086, 3.751, 3.416, 3.550, 3.617, 5.157, 5.559]\n\n 6. We note that the pattern is not exactly repeating. We might consider using the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But note: the last day (Day4) has higher values in the first part of the day and then decreases.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality. However, with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be well estimated.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can try to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours). \n\n    For hour 00:00: average of [3.215, 3.550, 4.622, 6.028] = (3.215+3.550+4.622+6.028)/4 = 4.35375\n    For hour 01:00: average of [3.684, 3.148, 4.689, 5.492] = (3.684+3.148+4.689+5.492)/4 = 4.25325\n    ... and so on.\n\n 9. But note: the user mentioned that the data has missing values? In the provided data we don't see any, but we are to forecast the next 96. We are generating the complete data for the next 96.\n\n 10. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2016-08-06 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-08-05 23:00:00)\n      Then 2016-08-06 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n 11. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours across the 4 days we have.\n\n 12. However, we note that the data might have a trend? Looking at the first hour (00:00): \n        Day1: 3.215, Day2: 3.550, Day3: 4.622, Day4: 6.028 -> increasing trend.\n     But we are only forecasting 4 days ahead, and we have only 4 days of history. Using a simple average might not capture the trend.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Day4) as the base and adjust by the average of the differences? But that might be too volatile.\n\n 14. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, we'll use the average method for each hour of the day.\n\n 15. Steps for each hour in the day (0 to 23):\n        value = (day1[hour] + day2[hour] + day3[hour] + day4[hour]) / 4\n\n 16. Then we repeat this same 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days (so 4 times).\n\n 17. But note: the pattern might be changing. We could also consider using a weighted average (with more weight to recent days). However, without a clear trend and with only 4 days, we stick to simple average.\n\n 18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0: (3.215 + 3.550 + 4.622 + 6.028) / 4 = 17.415 / 4 = 4.35375\n      hour1: (3.684 + 3.148 + 4.689 + 5.492) / 4 = 16.013 / 4 = 4.00325 -> but wait: 3.684+3.148=6.832, +4.689=11.521, +5.492=17.013 -> 17.013/4=4.25325\n      ... \n\n 19. We'll compute all 24 hours and then assign the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. However, we note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (less than a week) so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 21. Therefore, we use the daily average pattern.\n\n 22. Compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0: (3.215, 3.550, 4.622, 6.028) -> 4.35375\n      hour1: (3.684, 3.148, 4.689, 5.492) -> 4.25325\n      hour2: (3.885, 1.206, 3.751, 6.095) -> 3.73425\n      hour3: (4.957, 0.938, 4.354, 5.626) -> 3.96875\n      hour4: (5.023, 1.340, 3.952, 6.028) -> 4.08575\n      hour5: (5.157, 0.268, 4.019, 5.626) -> 3.7675\n      hour6: (4.354, 0.670, 4.287, 6.028) -> 3.83475\n      hour7: (4.555, 1.808, 4.689, 6.966) -> 4.2545\n      hour8: (4.220, 0.536, 4.823, 5.894) -> 3.86825\n      hour9: (2.411, 1.206, 4.220, 5.157) -> 3.2485\n      hour10: (3.215, -0.402, 4.622, 4.756) -> 3.04775\n      hour11: (2.411, 1.005, 4.220, 5.224) -> 3.215\n      hour12: (2.411, 1.005, 3.483, 3.818) -> 2.67925\n      hour13: (2.210, 0.938, 3.751, 4.488) -> 2.84675\n      hour14: (1.474, 0.938, 3.282, 4.555) -> 2.56225\n      hour15: (2.545, 0.938, 3.952, 3.818) -> 2.81325\n      hour16: (1.875, 2.344, 3.952, 4.019) -> 3.0475\n      hour17: (2.210, 3.751, 3.952, 4.086) -> 3.49975\n      hour18: (1.541, 4.287, 3.885, 3.751) -> 3.366\n      hour19: (0.804, 3.349, 3.684, 3.416) -> 2.81325\n      hour20: (1.541, 3.952, 3.684, 3.550) -> 3.18175\n      hour21: (0.737, 3.148, 3.952, 3.617) -> 2.8635\n      hour22: (2.009, 4.086, 4.086, 5.157) -> 3.8345\n      hour23: (3.014, 4.957, 6.095, 5.559) -> 4.90625\n\n 23. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day1 (2016-08-06): \n          00:00:00 -> 4.35375\n          01:00:00 -> 4.25325\n          02:00:00 -> 3.73425\n          ... until hour23: 4.90625\n\n      Day2 (2016-08-07): same 24 values as above\n      Day3 (2016-08-08): same\n      Day4 (2016-08-09): same\n\n 24. But note: the user might expect a more sophisticated method? However, with the limited data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 25. We must format the answer exactly as the input: two columns \"date\" and \"HULL\", with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", and the HULL rounded to 3 decimal places (as in the input).\n\n 26. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-08-06 00:00:00\n      Then add 1 hour until 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 28. However, note: the input data has 96 points and we are to forecast the next 96. The last provided point is 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll write the forecast in the same way.\n\n 30. Let's code the generation:\n\n      dates = []\n      start_date = datetime(2016, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0)\n      for i in range(96):\n          current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n          dates.append(current_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n      values = []\n      # We have 24 average values in a list: let's call it avg_hourly\n      # We need to repeat this list 4 times (for 4 days)\n      for i in range(4):\n          for j in range(24):\n              values.append(round(avg_hourly[j], 3))\n\n 31. Then we output in the required format.\n\n 32. But note: the input data has negative values? (like -0.402) so we are safe to output negative if the average is negative.\n\n 33. Let's compute the averages again to be sure and then round to 34. We'll write the 24 averages:\n\n      hour0: 4.35375 -> 4.354\n      hour1: 4.25325 -> 4.253\n      hour2: 3.73425 -> 3.734\n      hour3: 3.96875 -> 3.969\n      hour4: 4.08575 -> 4.086\n      hour5: 3.7675 -> 3.768\n      hour6: 3.83475 -> 3.835\n      hour7: 4.2545 -> 4.255\n      hour8: 3.86825 -> 3.868\n      hour9: 3.2485 -> 3.249\n      hour10: 3.04775 -> 3.048\n      hour11: 3.215 -> 3.215\n      hour12: 2.67925 -> 2.679\n      hour13: 2.84675 -> 2.847\n      hour14: 2.56225 -> 2.562\n      hour15: 2.81325 -> 2.813\n      hour16: 3.0475 -> 3.048\n      hour17: 3.49975 -> 3.500\n      hour18: 3.366 -> 3.366\n      hour19: 2.81325 -> 2.813\n      hour20: 3.18175 -> 3.182\n      hour21: 2.8635 -> 2.864\n      hour22: 3.8345 -> 3.835\n      hour23: 4.90625 -> 4.906\n\n 34. Now, we write the next 96 points.\n\n 35. However, note: the user said the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing values. We are to provide the complete data.\n\n 36. We output the data in the same format.\n\n 37. We write the answer in the required XML-like tag.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
