        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-08-26 00:00:00 to 2016-08-29 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-08-30 00:00:00 to 2016-09-02 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points is complete.\n 2. We must generate 96 forecasted values for the next 96 hours.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data shows daily seasonality (24 hours) and also a trend (we see daily fluctuations and a slight overall pattern),\n we can use a time series model that captures seasonality and trend.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. For forecasting, we assume the next 96 are consecutive.\n\n We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n Given the complexity and the need for an automated approach, we choose to use a model that is robust and can capture:\n   - Trend: The data does not show a strong long-term trend over the 4 days, but there are daily cycles.\n   - Seasonality: Clearly 24-hour cycles.\n\n We'll use a SARIMA model. We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,s) where s=24 for hourly data with daily seasonality.\n\n However, without the ability to run extensive model selection (as we are in a simulated environment) and given the small data size (only 96 points),\n we can use a simple model that has worked well for similar problems.\n\n After a brief analysis of the data:\n   - The series does not show a strong trend (the values are relatively stable around 25-30, with daily ups and downs). We can set d=0 or 1 and D=1 (for seasonal differencing).\n   - The ACF and PACF are not provided, so we rely on standard practice.\n\n A common starting point for hourly data with daily seasonality is SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1)[24]. But note that we have only 4 days of data, so we must be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler model. Since the data is limited, we are going to use a model that is not too complex.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   - Check for stationarity (if not stationary, difference).\n   - Identify orders.\n\n But since we are to provide the forecast without running actual code (as per the constraints of this problem), we rely on a pre-defined model that is known to work for such data.\n\n We note that the data has:\n   - A daily pattern: temperatures drop during the night and rise during the day.\n\n We can also consider using a naive seasonal model, but we want to be more accurate.\n\n Given the instructions, we must output the next 96 points.\n\n However, as an AI, I don't have the capability to run a full model in the background and output the exact numbers without actual computation.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You are an expert\", so we are expected to simulate the output.\n\n Since I cannot run a model, I will generate a forecast by:\n   - Extending the pattern of the last 4 days (96 hours) to the next 4 days, with a slight adjustment for the overall level.\n\n How?\n   We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days we have and then use that as the base pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the method:\n  1. Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n  2. Compute the average for each hour across the 4 days.\n  3. Use these 24 averages as the pattern for one day and repeat it for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level.\n\n Looking at the data:\n   Day 1 (2016-08-26): min ~22, max ~28.7\n   Day 2: min ~23, max ~28.5\n   Day 3: min ~20.3, max ~30.2\n   Day 4: min ~22.5, max ~29.8\n\n There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend. So we can assume the level is stable.\n\n However, the third day (2016-08-28) had a higher max. But without more data, we assume the pattern is consistent.\n\n We'll compute the hourly average over the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? Actually, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n   Hour 0: (28.702 + 22.863 + 23.848 + 24.481) / 4 = (28.702, 22.863, 23.848, 24.481) -> 24.9735\n   ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n However, we must note that the data might have some noise and the pattern might not be exactly the same every day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-08-29) as the base and adjust by the average of the previous days? \n\n But the problem requires 96 points and we must output.\n\n Since we are to provide the data, we are going to use the average method.\n\n However, let me calculate the first few:\n\n   Hour 0: (28.702 + 22.863001 + 23.848 + 24.481001) / 4 = \n        28.702 + 22.863 = 51.565\n        +23.848 = 75.413\n        +24.481 = 99.894\n        /4 = 24.9735\n\n   Hour 1: (28.139 + 23.636999 + 23.496 + 23.988001) /4 = \n        28.139 + 23.637 = 51.776\n        +23.496 = 75.272\n        +23.988 = 99.26\n        /4 = 24.815\n\n   Hour 2: (27.646 + 23.285 + 22.3 + 24.199) /4 = \n        27.646 + 23.285 = 50.931\n        +22.3 = 73.231\n        +24.199 = 97.43\n        /4 = 24.3575\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n Then the next 96 hours (4 days) would be:\n        Day1: 24.9735, 24.815, 24.3575, ... (for 24 hours)\n        Day2: same 24 numbers\n        Day3: same\n        Day4: same\n\n But note: the data shows that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. However, without a model, this is a simple seasonal naive approach.\n\n However, we must consider that the temperature might have a slight drift. But we don't have enough data to model that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days and then project that forward.\n\n But the problem is that the third day (2016-08-28) had a higher temperature. So the average might be slightly higher than the last day.\n\n However, we are going to use the average method.\n\n But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we don't have any in the provided data. So we are safe.\n\n Let me compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We have 4 days, so 4 observations per hour.\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour0 = [28.702, 22.863001, 23.848, 24.481001] -> mean = (28.702+22.863001+23.848+24.481001)/4 = 24.9735005\n        hour1 = [28.139, 23.636999, 23.496, 23.988001] -> (28.139+23.636999+23.496+23.988001)/4 = 24.815\n        hour2 = [27.646, 23.285, 22.3, 24.199] -> (27.646+23.285+22.3+24.199)/4 = 24.3575\n        hour3 = [27.857, 23.215, 22.159, 23.636999] -> (27.857+23.215+22.159+23.636999)/4 = 24.21674975\n        hour4 = [27.434999, 23.355, 22.299999, 23.073999] -> (27.434999+23.355+22.299999+23.073999)/4 = 24.04099925\n        hour5 = [26.662001, 23.073999, 20.962999, 22.580999] -> (26.662001+23.073999+20.962999+22.580999)/4 = 23.3199995\n        hour6 = [26.028, 23.143999, 20.33, 23.143999] -> (26.028+23.143999+20.33+23.143999)/4 = 23.16149925\n        hour7 = [25.325001, 23.566, 21.667, 23.917999] -> (25.325001+23.566+21.667+23.917999)/4 = 23.61899975\n        hour8 = [25.606001, 23.848, 22.580999, 25.395] -> (25.606001+23.848+22.580999+25.395)/4 = 24.3575\n        hour9 = [26.802, 25.254999, 25.325001, 26.662001] -> (26.802+25.254999+25.325001+26.662001)/4 = 26.01100025\n        hour10 = [26.802, 26.309999, 26.802, 26.169001] -> (26.802+26.309999+26.802+26.169001)/4 = 26.52099975\n        hour11 = [27.365, 26.662001, 26.802, 25.816999] -> (27.365+26.662001+26.802+25.816999)/4 = 26.66150025\n        hour12 = [26.521, 27.506001, 26.802, 27.787001] -> (26.521+27.506001+26.802+27.787001)/4 = 27.1540005\n        hour13 = [27.434999, 27.576, 27.576, 28.420000] -> (27.434999+27.576+27.576+28.420000)/4 = 27.75174975\n        hour14 = [27.787001, 28.490999, 29.052999, 28.490999] -> (27.787001+28.490999+29.052999+28.490999)/4 = 28.4554995\n        hour15 = [27.084, 28.209, 28.913, 29.334999] -> (27.084+28.209+28.913+29.334999)/4 = 28.385\n        hour16 = [27.365, 27.716999, 30.249001, 29.827] -> (27.365+27.716999+30.249001+29.827)/4 = 28.7895\n        hour17 = [25.816999, 27.716999, 30.249001, 29.264] -> (25.816999+27.716999+30.249001+29.264)/4 = 28.26174975\n        hour18 = [24.621, 26.521, 29.052999, 26.521] -> (24.621+26.521+29.052999+26.521)/4 = 26.67899975\n        hour19 = [23.848, 26.028, 27.646, 26.099001] -> (23.848+26.028+27.646+26.099001)/4 = 25.90525025\n        hour20 = [23.426001, 25.184, 26.662001, 25.254999] -> (23.426001+25.184+26.662001+25.254999)/4 = 25.13175025\n        hour21 = [23.003, 24.34, 25.816999, 25.816999] -> (23.003+24.34+25.816999+25.816999)/4 = 24.7442495\n        hour22 = [22.370001, 24.27, 25.254999, 24.691999] -> (22.370001+24.27+25.254999+24.691999)/4 = 24.14674975\n        hour23 = [22.089001, 23.988001, 24.621, 24.832001] -> (22.089001+23.988001+24.621+24.832001)/4 = 23.88250075\n\n Then the next 96 hours (from 2016-08-30 00:00:00 to 2016-09-02 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        2016-08-30 00:00:00: 24.9735005\n        2016-08-30 01:00:00: 24.815\n        2016-08-30 02:00:00: 24.3575\n        ... and so on for 24 hours, then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n However, note that the last day in the provided data is 2016-08-29, so:\n\n        Day 5: 2016-08-30\n        Day 6: 2016-08-31\n        Day 7: 2016-09-01\n        Day 8: 2016-09-02\n\n But wait, the provided data ends at 2016-08-29 23:00:00, so the next day starts at 2016-08-30 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate 96 points by repeating the 24 hourly averages 4 times.\n\n However, we must format the dates correctly and the numbers to 6 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input data has 6 decimal places, but we computed with more precision.
