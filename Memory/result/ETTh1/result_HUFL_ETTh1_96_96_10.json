        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to predict the next 96 steps.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing (all 96 are present).\n    However, we are to be cautious. Since the problem says the data will have missing values, but the provided past data does not have any, \n    we assume the past data is complete for modeling. For forecasting, we will produce 96 values without any missing.\n\n 3. We must use a time series forecasting method. Given the data is at hourly intervals and we have 4 days of data (96 points) to forecast 4 days ahead,\n    we can consider methods like:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Exponential Smoothing\n    - Prophet by Facebook\n    - LSTM or other deep learning methods (but might be overkill for 96 points)\n\n 4. However, note that we only have 96 points (4 days) of history. This is a very short history, so complex models might not be suitable.\n\n 5. We observe that the data has a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality). For example, looking at the data:\n    - Each day, the load drops during the night and rises during the day? But note: \n        On 2016-08-10: \n          - Low at 18:00 (10.784) and then rises at 20:00 (17.013) and then falls again at night.\n        On 2016-08-11: \n          - Low at 18:00 (6.631) and then rises at 20:00 (17.482)\n        On 2016-08-12: \n          - Low at 18:00 (11.721) and then rises at 20:00 (18.018)\n        On 2016-08-13:\n          - Low at 18:00 (12.793) and then rises at 20:00 (19.893)\n\n    So it seems there is a pattern: a drop in the evening (around 18:00-19:00) and then a peak at 20:00? But note the values at 20:00 are high and then they decrease.\n\n 6. Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture:\n    - A daily seasonality (period=24)\n    - Also, note that the level of the time series might be changing.\n\n 7. Given the short history, we can use a simple seasonal model. We'll use a seasonal naive approach as a baseline? But the problem says we are experts.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). However, with only 4 seasons (days) it might be challenging.\n\n 9. Another idea: use an average of the four days for each hour? But we see that the pattern is not exactly the same.\n\n 10. We can use an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA). The parameters for SARIMA: (p,d,q) for non-seasonal part and (P,D,Q,s) for seasonal part with s=24.\n\n 11. However, with only 96 points, we cannot fit a very complex model. We can try a simple model: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1,24) or similar.\n\n 12. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the first and last points: \n      Start: 17.884 (2016-08-10 00:00:00)\n      End: 18.084999 (2016-08-13 23:00:00)\n\n    The overall trend is not very clear. We can try without differencing? Or with one non-seasonal differencing?\n\n 13. We can also consider using the Prophet library, which is designed for time series with multiple seasonality and handles missing data, but we don't missing in the past.\n\n 14. However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We are to output 96 values.\n\n 15. Given the constraints (only 96 points of history and 96 points to forecast) and the fact that we are in an exam setting without the ability to run code, \n     we must use a method that can be reasoned.\n\n 16. Since we cannot run code, we can use a simple averaging method with seasonality:\n\n     We have 4 days. For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we can compute the average of that hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n\n     But note: the data might have a trend? We see that the values on the same hour of the day are not constant:\n\n        Hour 0: \n          2016-08-10: 17.884001\n          2016-08-11: 16.544001\n          2016-08-12: 18.152000\n          2016-08-13: 20.965000\n\n        This hour 0 is increasing. So we cannot just take the average.\n\n 17. We can do:\n\n     - First, remove the trend? But we don't have enough data to model a trend.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-08-13) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 19. Another idea: use a moving average of the last 24 hours and then project forward with the daily pattern? \n\n 20. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide an answer, we decide to use a simple method:\n\n     We will use the average of the four days for each hour to form the daily pattern, and then use that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n     Why? Because the trend is not very clear and we have only 4 days. The average pattern might capture the seasonality.\n\n     Steps:\n        - Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n        - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we use the computed mean for each hour.\n\n     But note: the last day (2016-08-13) has higher values? So the average might be pulled up by the last day.\n\n     However, without a better method, we proceed.\n\n 21. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        Hour 0: (17.884001 + 16.544001 + 18.152000 + 20.965000) / 4 = (73.545002) / 4 = 18.3862505\n        Hour 1: (16.544001 + 14.669000 + 16.611000 + 20.764000) / 4 = (68.588001) / 4 = 17.14700025\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. Then we assign:\n\n        Day 5 (2016-08-14) 00:00:00 -> 18.3862505\n                  01:00:00 -> 17.14700025\n                  ... until 23:00:00\n\n        Then Day 6 (2016-08-15) 00:00:00 -> 18.3862505\n        ... for 4 days.\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are to forecast without any missing? So we will output 96 values without missing.\n\n 24. However, this method does not account for any trend. We see that the last day was higher. We might adjust by the overall level? \n\n     We can compute the average of the entire last day and the average of the entire first day? The ratio? \n\n        First day (2016-08-10): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Last day (2016-08-13): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n\n        Then the trend factor per day? But we have 4 days, so we can compute the linear trend? \n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the last day as the base and then use the average daily pattern but scaled by the ratio of the last day's average to the overall average? \n\n     However, for simplicity and because we are limited by the exam setting, we will use the average of the four days for each hour.\n\n 26. We must generate the dates for the next 96 hours. The last date in the input is 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n        Next date: 2016-08-14 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values at that hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Note: the data we have:\n\n            Day1: 2016-08-10 (index 0-23)\n            Day2: 2016-08-11 (index 24-47)\n            Day3: 2016-08-12 (index 48-71)\n            Day4: 2016-08-13 (index 72-95)\n\n        We can group by the hour of the day.\n\n 28. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [17.884001, 16.544001, 18.152000, 20.965000] -> mean = (17.884001+16.544001+18.152000+20.965000)/4 = 73.545002/4 = 18.3862505\n        hour1: [16.544001, 14.669000, 16.611000, 20.764000] -> (16.544001+14.669000+16.611000+20.764000)=68.588001 -> 17.14700025\n        hour2: [16.410000, 14.870000, 16.611000, 18.219000] -> (16.41+14.87+16.611+18.219)=66.11 -> 16.5275\n        hour3: [14.803000, 14.937000, 15.405000, 18.620001] -> (14.803+14.937+15.405+18.620001)=63.765001 -> 15.94125025\n        hour4: [14.669000, 14.468000, 14.736000, 18.888000] -> (14.669+14.468+14.736+18.888)=62.761 -> 15.69025\n        hour5: [14.937000, 13.061000, 13.664000, 16.410000] -> (14.937+13.061+13.664+16.41)=58.072 -> 14.518\n        hour6: [16.945999, 14.602000, 12.994000, 15.472000] -> (16.945999+14.602+12.994+15.472)=60.013999 -> 15.00349975\n        hour7: [15.539000, 10.047000, 13.061000, 15.405000] -> (15.539+10.047+13.061+15.405)=54.052 -> 13.513\n        hour8: [14.200000, 11.253000, 12.927000, 14.200000] -> (14.2+11.253+12.927+14.2)=52.58 -> 13.145\n        hour9: [11.655000, 11.387000, 11.721000, 12.190000] -> (11.655+11.387+11.721+12.19)=46.953 -> 11.73825\n        hour10: [11.721000, 12.726000, 13.597000, 13.865000] -> (11.721+12.726+13.597+13.865)=51.909 -> 12.97725\n        hour11: [12.659000, 13.865000, 13.664000, 14.736000] -> (12.659+13.865+13.664+14.736)=54.924 -> 13.731\n        hour12: [11.721000, 13.731000, 13.530000, 14.736000] -> (11.721+13.731+13.53+14.736)=53.718 -> 13.4295\n        hour13: [13.396000, 14.736000, 14.602000, 15.137000] -> (13.396+14.736+14.602+15.137)=57.871 -> 14.46775\n        hour14: [13.061000, 14.535000, 14.200000, 15.271000] -> (13.061+14.535+14.2+15.271)=57.067 -> 14.26675\n        hour15: [12.257000, 13.262000, 13.999000, 14.937000] -> (12.257+13.262+13.999+14.937)=54.455 -> 13.61375\n        hour16: [11.922000, 12.458000, 12.659000, 13.195000] -> (11.922+12.458+12.659+13.195)=50.234 -> 12.5585\n        hour17: [11.588000, 11.454000, 12.860000, 13.061000] -> (11.588+11.454+12.86+13.061)=48.963 -> 12.24075\n        hour18: [10.784000, 6.631000, 11.721000, 12.793000] -> (10.784+6.631+11.721+12.793)=41.929 -> 10.48225\n        hour19: [11.855000, 10.248000, 12.391000, 13.865000] -> (11.855+10.248+12.391+13.865)=48.359 -> 12.08975\n        hour20: [17.013000, 17.482000, 18.018000, 19.893000] -> (17.013+17.482+18.018+19.893)=72.406 -> 18.1015\n        hour21: [15.807000, 17.146999, 17.816999, 18.955000] -> (15.807+17.146999+17.816999+18.955)=69.725998 -> 17.4314995\n        hour22: [15.338000, 17.951000, 21.434000, 19.357000] -> (15.338+17.951+21.434+19.357)=74.08 -> 18.52\n        hour23: [15.204000, 17.482000, 19.893000, 18.084999] -> (15.204+17.482+19.893+18.084999)=70.663999 -> 17.66599975\n\n 29. Now, we will use these 24 values (for 0 to 23) and repeat them for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 30. The forecast:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-08-14 00:00:00 -> 18.3862505\n               2016-08-14 01:00:00 -> 17.14700025\n               ... until 2016-08-14 23:00:00 -> 17.66599975\n\n        Day 2: 2016-08-15 00:00:00 -> 18.3862505\n               ... same pattern\n\n        Day 3: 2016-08-16: same pattern\n\n        Day 4: 2016-08-17: same pattern\n\n 2016-08-17 23:00:00 -> 17.66599975\n\n 31. We must format the output to have the same precision as the input? The input has up to 6 decimal places. We'll round to 6 decimal places.\n\n 32. However, note: the input has mixed precision (some with 3, some with 6). We'll output 6 decimal places.\n\n 33. We write the dates and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n 34. The dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-14 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n 35. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        We have 4 blocks of 24 hours, each block is the same 24 numbers we computed.\n\n 36. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 37. Note: We are to output the data exactly in the same way as the input, with the new dates.\n\n 38. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        <some date> <value>\n        ... 96 lines\n\n        </answer>\n\n 39. We must not omit any content.\n\n 40. Let's write the 96 lines.\n\n 41. We'll create a list of the 24 average values (rounded to 6 decimal places) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 42. The 24 average values (rounded to 6 decimal places):\n\n        hour0: 18.386251 -> 18.386251 (we'll keep as computed and round to 6 decimals)\n        Actually, we computed:\n\n            hour0: 18.3862505 -> 18.386251 (if rounded to 6 decimals, but note: 18.3862505 rounded to 6 decimals is 18.386251? \n            But let's do: \n                18.3862505 -> the 7th decimal is 5, so we round up: 18.386251\n\n        However, to be consistent, we'll use:\n\n            value = round(computed_value, 6)\n\n        But note: the input has values like 17.884001, which is 6 decimals. So we output 6 decimals.\n\n        We'll compute the average and then round to 6 decimals.\n\n 43. Let's recalc the 24 values and round each to 6 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 18.3862505 -> 18.386251\n        hour1: 17.14700025 -> 17.147000\n        hour2: 16.5275 -> 16.527500\n        hour3: 15.94125025 -> 15.941250\n        hour4: 15.69025 -> 15.690250\n        hour5: 14.518 -> 14.518000\n        hour6: 15.00349975 -> 15.003500\n        hour7: 13.513 -> 13.513000\n        hour8: 13.145 -> 13.145000\n        hour9: 11.73825 -> 11.738250\n        hour10: 12.97725 -> 12.977250\n        hour11: 13.731 -> 13.731000\n        hour12: 13.4295 -> 13.429500\n        hour13: 14.46775 -> 14.467750\n        hour14: 14.26675 -> 14.266750\n        hour15: 13.61375 -> 13.613750\n        hour16: 12.5585 -> 12.558500\n        hour17: 12.24075 -> 12.240750\n        hour18: 10.48225 -> 10.482250\n        hour19: 12.08975 -> 12.089750\n        hour20: 18.1015 -> 18.101500\n        hour21: 17.4314995 -> 17.431500\n        hour22: 18.52 -> 18.520000   (but note: 18.52 is 18.520000)\n        hour23: 17.66599975 -> 17.666000\n\n 44. However, note: \n        hour0: 18.3862505 -> the 6th decimal is the 5th digit after the decimal? \n            Actually, 18.3862505 has:\n                3: tenths, 8: hundredths, 6: thousandths, 2: ten thousandths, 5: hundred thousandths, 0: millionths, 5: ten millionths.\n            We want 6 decimal places -> so we look at the 7th decimal (which is 5) -> round up the 6th decimal (0 becomes 1) -> 18.386251\n\n        Similarly, hour1: 17.14700025 -> the 7th decimal is 2, so we don't round up -> 17.147000\n\n        hour2: 16.5275 -> we can write as 16.527500\n\n        hour3: 15.94125025 -> 7th decimal is 2 -> 15.941250\n\n        hour4: 15.69025 -> 15.690250\n\n        hour5: 14.518 -> 14.518000\n\n        hour6: 15.00349975 -> 7th decimal is 7, so we round up the 6th decimal (9 becomes 10 -> so 15.003500)\n\n        hour7: 13.513 -> 13.513000\n\n        hour8: 13.145 -> 13.145000\n\n        hour9: 11.73825 -> 11.738250\n\n        hour10: 12.97725 -> 12.977250\n\n        hour11: 13.731 -> 13.731000\n\n        hour12: 13.4295 -> 13.429500\n\n        hour13: 14.46775 -> 14.467750\n\n        hour14: 14.26675 -> 14.266750\n\n        hour15: 13.61375 -> 13.613750\n\n        hour16: 12.5585 -> 12.558500\n\n        hour17: 12.24075 -> 12.240750\n\n        hour18: 10.48225 -> 10.482250\n\n        hour19: 12.08975 -> 12.089750\n\n        hour20: 18.1015 -> 18.101500\n\n        hour21: 17.4314995 -> 7th decimal is 5 -> round up: 17.431500\n\n        hour22: 18.52 -> 18.520000\n\n        hour23: 17.66599975 -> 7th decimal is 7 -> round up: 17.666000\n\n 45. So the 24 values for the day:\n\n        [18.386251, 17.147000, 16.527500, 15.941250, 15.690250, 14.518000, 15.003500, 13.513000, 13.145000, 11.738250, 12.977250, 13.731000, 13.429500, 14.467750, 14.266750, 13.613750, 12.558500, 12.240750, 10.482250, 12.089750, 18.101500, 17.431500, 18.520000, 17.666000]\n\n 46. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-14 00:00:00 -> 18.386251\n               2016-08-14 01:00:00 -> 17.147000\n               ... until 2016-08-14 23:00:00 -> 17.666000\n\n        Then 2016-08-15 00:00:00 -> 18.386251\n        ... and so on.\n\n 47. We generate the dates:\n\n        We start from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 and add one hour until we have 96 records.\n\n 48. We write the data in the format:\n\n        YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS <value>\n\n 49. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-08-14 00:00:00 18.386251\n        2016-08-14 01:00:00 17.147000\n        2016-08-14 02:00:00 16.527500\n        2016-08-14 03:00:00 15.941250\n        2016-08-14 04:00:00 15.690250\n        2016-08-14 05:00:00 14.518000\n        2016-08-14 06:00:00 15.003500\n        2016-08-14 07:00:00 13.513000\n        2016-08-14 08:00:00 13.145000\n        2016-08-14 09:00:00 11.738250\n        2016-08-14 10:00:00 12.977250\n        2016-08-14 11:00:00 13.731000\n        2016-08-14 12:00:00 13.429500\n        2016-08-14 13:00:00 14.467750\n        2016-08-14 14:00:00 14.266750\n        2016-08-14 15:00:00 13.613750\n        2016-08-14 16:00:00 12.558500\n        2016-08-14 17:00:00 12.240750\n        2016-08-14 18:00:00 10.482250\n        2016-08-14 19:00:00 12.089750\n        2016-08-14 20:00:00 18.101500\n        2016-08-14 21:00:00 17.431500\n        2016-08-14 22:00:00 18.520000\n        2016-08-14 23:00:00 17.666000\n\n        Then repeat for the next 3 days:\n\n        2016-08-15 00:00:00 18.386251\n        ... and so on until 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n 50. We write 96 lines.\n\n 51. We note that the last date in the input is 2016-08-13 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours are from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n 52. We output the data.\n\n 53. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. \n     We have provided 96 values without missing.\n\n 54. We use the computed 24 values and repeat 4 times.\n\n 55. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 56. We code the answer as a string in the required format.\n\n 57. We must be cautious: the rounding might have introduced slight changes, but we followed the input precision.\n\n 58. We output.\n",
