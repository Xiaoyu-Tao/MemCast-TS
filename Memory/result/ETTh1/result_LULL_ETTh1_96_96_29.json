        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with 24-hour cycles.\n 2. The data also shows some negative values on 2016-10-28, which might be due to the specific context (maybe a drop in load?).\n 3. We must handle the possibility of missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast should be robustly generated.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with a time series with seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days ahead, we can consider:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, repeated for 4 days? But note the data on 2016-10-28 is negative and the previous days are positive. So we might need a more robust method.\n\n However, the data shows a clear pattern during the day: \n   - Low values during night, then increasing during the day, peaking in the morning and then decreasing? But let's observe:\n\n   On 2016-10-25: \n       00:00: 0.579, then 0.579, 0.609, ... 08:00: 0.853, 09:00:0.883, 10:00:1.036, then decreases in the afternoon and evening.\n\n   On 2016-10-26: \n       00:00: 1.157, then 1.097, ... 08:00:1.401, 09:00:1.310, 10:00:1.371, 11:00:1.614, then decreases.\n\n   On 2016-10-27: \n       00:00:1.097, ... 08:00:1.401, 09:00:1.584, 10:00:1.614, 11:00:1.462, then decreases.\n\n   On 2016-10-28: \n       00:00: -0.853, ... 08:00: -0.396, 09:00: -0.335, 10:00: -0.305, 11:00: -0.366, then becomes more negative in the evening.\n\n The pattern on 2016-10-28 is inverted and negative. This might be an anomaly or a different behavior. Since we are to forecast the next 96 hours (starting from 2016-10-29 00:00:00), we have to decide:\n\n Option 1: The negative values on 2016-10-28 might be an anomaly? Then we should rely more on the previous days? \n Option 2: Or it might be a new pattern? But without more context, it's hard.\n\n However, the problem states that the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. But we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n Considering the requirement for a complete forecast and the short history, we can use a simple method:\n\n   - Use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But the negative values on the last day might pull the average down.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use the median of the same hour for the past 4 days? That might be more robust to the last day's anomaly.\n\n   - But note: the last day (2016-10-28) is very different. It might be a data error? Or a real event? Since we don't have more data, we have to make an assumption.\n\n   - Another idea: use the last day (2016-10-28) as the pattern for the next days? But that would give negative forecasts. However, the previous days were positive. \n\n   - Given the ambiguity, we might consider a hybrid: for each hour, take the median of the past 4 days. The median is robust to outliers.\n\n   - However, the problem says \"missing values\" might occur in the data we are to forecast? But we are generating the forecast, so we must generate complete data.\n\n   - We are to forecast 96 points (4 days) from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00.\n\n Steps for median method:\n\n   For hour 00:00: \n       2016-10-25: 0.579\n       2016-10-26: 1.157\n       2016-10-27: 1.097\n       2016-10-28: -0.853\n       Median: sort -> [-0.853, 0.579, 1.097, 1.157] -> median = (0.579+1.097)/2 = 0.838\n\n   But note: the median for an even number of observations is the average of the two middle ones? Actually, we can use the median which is the middle value when ordered. For even n, it's the average of the two middle? But in time series, sometimes we just take one of the middle? However, the standard is to average.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median of the last 3 days? But the problem says we have 4 days.\n\n   However, the last day is negative and the previous three are positive. The median for 00:00 would be 0.838. But let's see the pattern: the values for 00:00 are increasing then a drop? \n\n   Another idea: use the average of the last 3 days (excluding the last day) for the forecast? But that might ignore the most recent day.\n\n   Given the sudden change on 2016-10-28, it might be a data quality issue? Or a real event? Without domain knowledge, we have to be cautious.\n\n   Since the problem says \"be aware of missing values\" but we don't have any in the provided data, and we are to forecast, we can assume that the pattern of the last day might continue? But that would be negative.\n\n   However, the problem context: oil temperature and load metrics. Load can be negative? It might be possible if there is reverse power flow? But typically, load is positive. So the negative values might be an error? \n\n   Looking at the data: \n        2016-10-28 00:00:00: -0.853\n        ... until 23:00: -0.975\n\n   This is a whole day of negative values. It might be a sensor issue? Or a system issue? \n\n   Considering the requirement to forecast, and without more context, we decide to use the median of the same hour for the past 4 days. This will at least be robust to one day of anomaly.\n\n   But note: the median for the 00:00 hour: \n        Day1: 0.579, Day2: 1.157, Day3: 1.097, Day4: -0.853 -> sorted: [-0.853, 0.579, 1.097, 1.157] -> median = (0.579+1.097)/2 = 0.838\n\n   Similarly, for 01:00: \n        Day1: 0.579, Day2: 1.097, Day3: 0.944, Day4: -0.914 -> sorted: [-0.914, 0.579, 0.944, 1.097] -> median = (0.579+0.944)/2 = 0.7615\n\n   And so on.\n\n   We will generate 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) by computing the median for each hour (00, 01, ... 23) across the 4 days.\n\n   However, note: the data we have is exactly 4 days? \n        2016-10-25 to 2016-10-28: 4 days, 96 hours.\n\n   So we can create a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours). Then for each hour of the day, we take the median of the 4 values.\n\n   But note: the data is hourly and we have 24 hours per day.\n\n   Steps:\n        - Reshape the 96 points into a 4x24 matrix.\n        - For each hour (column), compute the median of the 4 values.\n        - Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same 24-hour median pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   But is that reasonable? It assumes that the pattern is the same for every day? And the median will smooth out the anomaly on day 4.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use the median of the first 3 days and ignore the last day? But the last day might be the most recent and important.\n\n   We'll stick to using all 4 days with median.\n\n   However, note: the last day (2016-10-28) is negative and the median for some hours might be negative? For example, at 00:00 we got 0.838 (positive). But let's check 20:00:\n\n        Day1: 0.701\n        Day2: 1.066\n        Day3: 0.944\n        Day4: -1.005\n        Sorted: [-1.005, 0.701, 0.944, 1.066] -> median = (0.701+0.944)/2 = 0.8225\n\n   So positive.\n\n   But at 22:00:\n\n        Day1: 0.640\n        Day2: 1.036\n        Day3: 0.914\n        Day4: -1.036\n        Sorted: [-1.036, 0.640, 0.914, 1.036] -> median = (0.640+0.914)/2 = 0.777\n\n   So the median is positive for all hours? \n\n   Actually, let's check 19:00:\n\n        Day1: 0.640\n        Day2: 1.066\n        Day3: 1.036\n        Day4: -1.005\n        Sorted: [-1.005, 0.640, 1.036, 1.066] -> median = (0.640+1.036)/2 = 0.838\n\n   And 21:00:\n\n        Day1: 0.761\n        Day2: 1.066\n        Day3: 0.975\n        Day4: -1.005\n        Sorted: [-1.005, 0.761, 0.975, 1.066] -> median = (0.761+0.975)/2 = 0.868\n\n   So it seems the median is always positive? \n\n   Therefore, we can generate the 24 median values and then repeat them 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast, so we don't have missing values in the forecast? We are to provide complete data.\n\n   However, if we are to be cautious, we can also consider that the last day might be an error and we should not include it? But without evidence, we include it.\n\n   Let's compute the 24 medians:\n\n        hour00: (0.579, 1.157, 1.097, -0.853) -> sorted: [-0.853, 0.579, 1.097, 1.157] -> median = (0.579+1.097)/2 = 0.838\n        hour01: (0.579, 1.097, 0.944, -0.914) -> sorted: [-0.914, 0.579, 0.944, 1.097] -> median = (0.579+0.944)/2 = 0.7615\n        hour02: (0.609, 1.097, 0.944, -0.975) -> sorted: [-0.975, 0.609, 0.944, 1.097] -> median = (0.609+0.944)/2 = 0.7765\n        hour03: (0.579, 1.066, 0.975, -0.944) -> sorted: [-0.944, 0.579, 0.975, 1.066] -> median = (0.579+0.975)/2 = 0.777\n        hour04: (0.548, 1.097, 0.914, -0.944) -> sorted: [-0.944, 0.548, 0.914, 1.097] -> median = (0.548+0.914)/2 = 0.731\n        hour05: (0.609, 1.066, 0.914, -0.914) -> sorted: [-0.914, 0.609, 0.914, 1.066] -> median = (0.609+0.914)/2 = 0.7615\n        hour06: (0.579, 1.249, 1.249, -0.853) -> sorted: [-0.853, 0.579, 1.249, 1.249] -> median = (0.579+1.249)/2 = 0.914\n        hour07: (0.731, 1.432, 1.371, -0.487) -> sorted: [-0.487, 0.731, 1.371, 1.432] -> median = (0.731+1.371)/2 = 1.051\n        hour08: (0.853, 1.401, 1.401, -0.396) -> sorted: [-0.396, 0.853, 1.401, 1.401] -> median = (0.853+1.401)/2 = 1.127\n        hour09: (0.883, 1.310, 1.584, -0.335) -> sorted: [-0.335, 0.883, 1.310, 1.584] -> median = (0.883+1.310)/2 = 1.0965\n        hour10: (1.036, 1.371, 1.614, -0.305) -> sorted: [-0.305, 1.036, 1.371, 1.614] -> median = (1.036+1.371)/2 = 1.2035\n        hour11: (0.914, 1.614, 1.462, -0.366) -> sorted: [-0.366, 0.914, 1.462, 1.614] -> median = (0.914+1.462)/2 = 1.188\n        hour12: (0.853, 1.371, 1.523, -0.426) -> sorted: [-0.426, 0.853, 1.371, 1.523] -> median = (0.853+1.371)/2 = 1.112\n        hour13: (0.944, 1.371, 1.645, -0.457) -> sorted: [-0.457, 0.944, 1.371, 1.645] -> median = (0.944+1.371)/2 = 1.1575\n        hour14: (0.883, 1.462, 1.584, -0.457) -> sorted: [-0.457, 0.883, 1.462, 1.584] -> median = (0.883+1.462)/2 = 1.1725\n        hour15: (0.731, 1.432, 1.645, -0.305) -> sorted: [-0.305, 0.731, 1.432, 1.645] -> median = (0.731+1.432)/2 = 1.0815\n        hour16: (0.822, 1.371, 1.614, -0.244) -> sorted: [-0.244, 0.822, 1.371, 1.614] -> median = (0.822+1.371)/2 = 1.0965\n        hour17: (0.670, 1.371, 1.462, -0.609) -> sorted: [-0.609, 0.670, 1.371, 1.462] -> median = (0.670+1.371)/2 = 1.0205\n        hour18: (0.761, 1.097, 1.157, -0.761) -> sorted: [-0.761, 0.761, 1.097, 1.157] -> median = (0.761+1.097)/2 = 0.929\n        hour19: (0.640, 1.066, 1.036, -1.005) -> sorted: [-1.005, 0.640, 1.036, 1.066] -> median = (0.640+1.036)/2 = 0.838\n        hour20: (0.701, 1.066, 0.944, -1.005) -> sorted: [-1.005, 0.701, 0.944, 1.066] -> median = (0.701+0.944)/2 = 0.8225\n        hour21: (0.761, 1.066, 0.975, -1.005) -> sorted: [-1.005, 0.761, 0.975, 1.066] -> median = (0.761+0.975)/2 = 0.868\n        hour22: (0.640, 1.036, 0.914, -1.036) -> sorted: [-1.036, 0.640, 0.914, 1.036] -> median = (0.640+0.914)/2 = 0.777\n        hour23: (0.609, 1.066, 0.822, -0.975) -> sorted: [-0.975, 0.609, 0.822, 1.066] -> median = (0.609+0.822)/2 = 0.7155\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-10-29): [0.838, 0.7615, 0.7765, 0.7155]\n        Day2 (2016-10-30): same as Day1\n        Day3 (2016-10-31): same as Day1\n        Day4 (2016-11-01): same as Day1\n\n   But note: the dates must be generated.
