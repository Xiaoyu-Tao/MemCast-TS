        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-07-24 00:00:00 to 2017-07-27 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load drops during the day and rises at night.\n 2. There are missing values in the provided data? Actually, the provided data for the past 96 points does not have missing values? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n    Since the problem says the data we are given has missing values, but in the example we don't see any? We'll assume the provided 96 are complete for now.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a time series model that handles seasonality. Since the data is hourly and has daily seasonality (period=24),\n    we can use a seasonal model. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete answer, we might use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the value from the same time in the previous season (i.e., same hour of the previous day) as the forecast.\n    - However, we have 4 days of data. We can use the last day (2017-07-23) as the base for the next day? But note that the pattern might change.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days for the same hour? But note that the data shows a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days, so we don't have a full week.\n\n 5. Since the problem does not specify the model, we are to use our expertise. We can use a simple method to capture the daily seasonality.\n\n    Approach:\n    - We'll take the last day (2017-07-23) and use it as the base for the next day (2017-07-24). Then for the following days, we can use the same pattern or adjust slightly?\n    - However, note that the data from 2017-07-20 to 2017-07-23 shows a pattern that is not exactly repeating. We can try to capture the trend and seasonality.\n\n 6. We can also consider using an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonality. But without the ability to run code, we are to generate the forecast manually? \n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can do:\n\n    Option 1: Seasonal Naive for the next day, and then for the subsequent days, we can use the same pattern? But we have 4 days of history, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days?\n\n    Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n    We have 4 days: 2017-07-20, 2017-07-21, 2017-07-22, 2017-07-23.\n\n    For hour 00:00: (17.816999 + 19.759001 + 20.764000 + 20.094000) / 4\n    For hour 01:00: (17.482000 + 19.558001 + 19.893000 + 19.893000) / 4\n    ... and so on.\n\n    Then we can use this average pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours). But note: the next 4 days are 2017-07-24 to 2017-07-27, which are 4 days.\n\n 8. However, we note that the data on 2017-07-23 has an anomaly at 21:00:00 (it drops to 15.070000, which is much lower than the previous days). This might be an outlier? \n    But we are to forecast without any data cleaning? \n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of outliers? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n 10. Since the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but in the provided 96 points we don't have missing values, we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n 11. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile, and then repeat that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        - For each hour in the day (00:00 to 23:00), we have 4 values (from day1 to day4).\n        - Compute the average for that hour.\n        - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign:\n            Day 1 (2017-07-24): the average for hour 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00\n            Day 2 (2017-07-25): the same average pattern\n            Day 3 (2017-07-26): same\n            Day 4 (2017-07-27): same\n\n    But note: the average might smooth out the pattern and we lose the trend? However, we only have 4 days and the next 4 days are consecutive, so we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n 12. However, we note that the last day (2017-07-23) has a drop at 21:00. If we average, that hour will be:\n\n        Hour 21:00: (20.629999 + 20.094000 + 20.629999 + 15.070000) / 4 = (20.63 + 20.09 + 20.63 + 15.07) / 4 = 76.42 / 4 = 19.105\n\n    This is a reasonable smoothing.\n\n 13. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n    Hour 0: [17.816999, 19.759001, 20.764000, 20.094000] -> average = (17.817+19.759+20.764+20.094)/4 = 78.434/4 = 19.6085\n    Hour 1: [17.482000, 19.558001, 19.893000, 19.893000] -> (17.482+19.558+19.893+19.893)/4 = 76.826/4 = 19.2065\n    Hour 2: [19.826000, 20.027000, 19.424000, 18.888000] -> (19.826+20.027+19.424+18.888)/4 = 78.165/4 = 19.54125\n    Hour 3: [14.736000, 18.152000, 17.549000, 18.219000] -> (14.736+18.152+17.549+18.219)/4 = 68.656/4 = 17.164\n    Hour 4: [16.275999, 16.410000, 17.750000, 17.146999] -> (16.276+16.410+17.750+17.147)/4 = 67.583/4 = 16.89575\n    Hour 5: [16.745001, 15.338000, 17.281000, 17.615999] -> (16.745+15.338+17.281+17.616)/4 = 66.98/4 = 16.745\n    Hour 6: [15.070000, 15.539000, 15.673000, 16.677999] -> (15.070+15.539+15.673+16.678)/4 = 62.96/4 = 15.74\n    Hour 7: [11.052000, 11.588000, 13.597000, 12.257000] -> (11.052+11.588+13.597+12.257)/4 = 48.494/4 = 12.1235\n    Hour 8: [4.756000, 5.224000, 5.224000, 7.502000] -> (4.756+5.224+5.224+7.502)/4 = 22.706/4 = 5.6765\n    Hour 9: [0.000000, -1.206000, 0.469000, 1.808000] -> (0.0 -1.206 +0.469+1.808)/4 = 1.071/4 = 0.26775\n    Hour 10: [-4.488000, -3.550000, -1.741000, -0.670000] -> (-4.488-3.550-1.741-0.670)/4 = -10.449/4 = -2.61225\n    Hour 11: [-6.028000, -5.157000, -3.081000, -1.808000] -> (-6.028-5.157-3.081-1.808)/4 = -16.074/4 = -4.0185\n    Hour 12: [-7.301000, -5.827000, -3.952000, -1.407000] -> (-7.301-5.827-3.952-1.407)/4 = -18.487/4 = -4.62175\n    Hour 13: [-5.760000, -5.492000, -1.608000, -1.206000] -> (-5.76-5.492-1.608-1.206)/4 = -14.066/4 = -3.5165\n    Hour 14: [-4.555000, -3.349000, 0.000000, -0.268000] -> (-4.555-3.349+0-0.268)/4 = -8.172/4 = -2.043\n    Hour 15: [-1.139000, -0.536000, 2.143000, 1.942000] -> (-1.139-0.536+2.143+1.942)/4 = 2.41/4 = 0.6025\n    Hour 16: [-0.134000, 1.072000, 4.287000, 3.751000] -> (-0.134+1.072+4.287+3.751)/4 = 8.976/4 = 2.244\n    Hour 17: [4.689000, 6.765000, 7.301000, 8.707000] -> (4.689+6.765+7.301+8.707)/4 = 27.462/4 = 6.8655\n    Hour 18: [9.444000, 10.650000, 10.918000, 11.454000] -> (9.444+10.65+10.918+11.454)/4 = 42.466/4 = 10.6165\n    Hour 19: [12.458000, 13.061000, 14.401000, 14.468000] -> (12.458+13.061+14.401+14.468)/4 = 54.388/4 = 13.597\n    Hour 20: [18.486000, 19.625000, 19.826000, 21.166000] -> (18.486+19.625+19.826+21.166)/4 = 78.103/4 = 19.52575\n    Hour 21: [20.629999, 20.094000, 20.629999, 15.070000] -> (20.63+20.094+20.63+15.07)/4 = 76.424/4 = 19.106\n    Hour 22: [20.094000, 20.027000, 20.830999, 15.004000] -> (20.094+20.027+20.831+15.004)/4 = 75.956/4 = 18.989\n    Hour 23: [18.687000, 19.959999, 20.764000, 15.539000] -> (18.687+19.96+20.764+15.539)/4 = 74.95/4 = 18.7375\n\n 14. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-07-24 00:00:00 -> 19.6085\n           2017-07-24 01:00:00 -> 19.2065\n           ... until 23:00:00 -> 18.7375\n\n    Day 2: 2017-07-25 00:00:00 -> 19.6085\n           ... same as day1\n\n    Day 3: 2017-07-26: same\n    Day 4: 2017-07-27: same\n\n 15. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are generating a complete forecast. We are not missing any.\n\n 16. Format: We must output the next 96 records in the same format as the input, with the date and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n    Example:\n\n        2017-07-24 00:00:00 19.6085\n        2017-07-24 01:00:00 19.2065\n        ...\n\n 17. We'll round to 3 decimal places? The input had up to 3 decimal places. But note the input had 6 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places for the fractional part.\n\n    We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 18. However, note that the input had some negative values and some with more than 3 decimal places? But we see the input is given with 3 decimal places.\n\n    We'll format each value to have 3 decimal places.\n\n 19. Let's write the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-07-24 00:00:00\n    Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-07-27 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 21. The average values for each hour (0 to 23) are:\n\n        hour0: 19.6085 -> 19.608\n        hour1: 19.2065 -> 19.206\n        hour2: 19.54125 -> 19.541\n        hour3: 17.164 -> 17.164\n        hour4: 16.89575 -> 16.896\n        hour5: 16.745 -> 16.745\n        hour6: 15.74 -> 15.740\n        hour7: 12.1235 -> 12.123\n        hour8: 5.6765 -> 5.676\n        hour9: 0.26775 -> 0.268\n        hour10: -2.61225 -> -2.612\n        hour11: -4.0185 -> -4.018\n        hour12: -4.62175 -> -4.622\n        hour13: -3.5165 -> -3.516\n        hour14: -2.043 -> -2.043\n        hour15: 0.6025 -> 0.602\n        hour16: 2.244 -> 2.244\n        hour17: 6.8655 -> 6.866\n        hour18: 10.6165 -> 10.616\n        hour19: 13.597 -> 13.597\n        hour20: 19.52575 -> 19.526\n        hour21: 19.106 -> 19.106\n        hour22: 18.989 -> 18.989\n        hour23: 18.7375 -> 18.738\n\n 22. Now, for each day from 2017-07-24 to 2017-07-27, we assign the 24-hour pattern.\n\n 23. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-24 00:00:00 19.608\n2017-07-24 01:00:00 19.206\n2017-07-24 02:00:00 19.541\n2017-07-24 03:00:00 17.164\n2017-07-24 04:00:00 16.896\n2017-07-24 05:00:00 16.745\n2017-07-24 06:00:00 15.740\n2017-07-24 07:00:00 12.123\n2017-07-24 08:00:00 5.676\n2017-07-24 09:00:00 0.268\n2017-07-24 10:00:00 -2.612\n2017-07-24 11:00:00 -4.018\n2017-07-24 12:00:00 -4.622\n2017-07-24 13:00:00 -3.516\n2017-07-24 14:00:00 -2.043\n2017-07-24 15:00:00 0.602\n2017-07-24 16:00:00 2.244\n2017-07-24 17:00:00 6.866\n2017-07-24 18:00:00 10.616\n2017-07-24 19:00:00 13.597\n2017-07-24 20:00:00 19.526\n2017-07-24 21:00:00 19.106\n2017-07-24 22:00:00 18.989\n2017-07-24 23:00:00 18.738\n2017-07-25 00:00:00 19.608\n2017-07-25 01:00:00 19.206\n... and so on for 2017-07-25, 2017-07-26, 2017-07-27.\n\n 24.
