        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to produce 96 future points.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't see any missing. However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We must use a time series forecasting method that can handle the characteristics of the data.\n\n Approach:\n - We observe that the data has daily seasonality (24 hours). There are patterns that repeat every day.\n - We can use a seasonal model or a model that captures seasonality. Given the data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n      - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, and repeat for 4 days? But note: the pattern might not be exactly the same and we have 4 days to forecast.\n      - However, looking at the data, the pattern from day to day is not exactly repeating. We might need a model that can capture trends and seasonality.\n\n - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, or an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA).\n\n But note: the data is small (only 4 days of history) and we are forecasting 4 days. This is challenging.\n\n However, the problem says the dataset is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 96 points? Actually, the user says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\". So we have 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Given the small history, we can try to use a daily pattern. Let's break the data into 4 days:\n\n   Day1: 2017-01-05 -> 24 points\n   Day2: 2017-01-06 -> 24 points\n   Day3: 2017-01-07 -> 24 points\n   Day4: 2017-01-08 -> 24 points\n\n We can compute the average pattern over these 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the last day (2017-01-08) might be more representative for the immediate future.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the seasonal pattern.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing. So we can proceed.\n\n Since we are to provide 96 points and the data is small, we can use a simple method:\n\n   - Use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n   For example, for the hour 00:00:00 of 2017-01-09, we take the average of the 00:00:00 values of 2017-01-05, 2017-01-06, 2017-01-07, 2017-01-08.\n\n   Similarly for 01:00:00, and so on.\n\n   But note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the 00:00:00 values:\n\n        2017-01-05 00:00:00: 13.329\n        2017-01-06 00:00:00: 8.774\n        2017-01-07 00:00:00: 7.703\n        2017-01-08 00:00:00: 14.267\n\n   The average: (13.329 + 8.774 + 7.703 + 14.267) / 4 = 10.76825\n\n   Then for 2017-01-09 00:00:00, we use 10.768.\n\n   Similarly, we do for every hour in the day.\n\n   Then for the next day (2017-01-10) we can use the same pattern? But note: we don't have a trend component. Alternatively, we can use the same 4-day average for each hour for all 4 days of the forecast.\n\n   However, this would make the forecast for each day identical? That might not be realistic.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-08) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences between consecutive days? But that might be too complex.\n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can do:\n\n        Forecast for day 5 (2017-01-09) = average of day1, day2, day3, day4 (by hour)\n        Forecast for day 6 (2017-01-10) = average of day2, day3, day4, and the forecasted day5? But we don't have day5.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same pattern for all 4 forecast days? That is, each day in the forecast will be the same as the average day we computed.\n\n   But note: the problem does not specify the method. We are the expert.\n\n   However, let me look at the data: the values on 2017-01-08 are higher than the previous days? So maybe there is a weekly pattern? But we don't have weekly data (only 4 days).\n\n   Another idea: use the last day (2017-01-08) and then add a small random noise? But that is not be scientific.\n\n   Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n        We compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 available days.\n\n        Then we use that average pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   This is a simple seasonal average model.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let h in [0,23] (hour of the day)\n\n        For each h, compute:\n            avg_h = (value_h from day1 + value_h from day2 + value_h from day3 + value_h from day4) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (2017-01-09 to 2017-01-12), for each day, at hour h, we set the forecast to avg_h.\n\n   But note: the data has 24 hours per day, so we have 24 averages.\n\n   Then we will have 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n   However, we must check if the data has any trend? The provided 96 points do not have missing, so we can compute the averages.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 00: (13.329 + 8.774 + 7.703 + 14.267) / 4 = (13.329+8.774=22.103; 22.103+7.703=29.806; 29.806+14.267=44.073) -> 44.073/4 = 11.01825\n        Hour 01: (13.865 + 8.573 + 7.502 + 12.257) / 4 = (13.865+8.573=22.438; 22.438+7.502=29.94; 29.94+12.257=42.197) -> 42.197/4 = 10.54925\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then we assign:\n\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00 -> 11.018\n        2017-01-09 01:00:00 -> 10.549\n        ... until 2017-01-09 23:00:00\n\n        Then 2017-01-10 00:00:00 -> 11.018\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, note: the data on 2017-01-08 is higher than the previous days? So the average might be pulled up by the last day. But without more data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use a weighted average where the last day has more weight? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a forecast, we choose the simple average.\n\n   Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: (13.329, 8.774, 7.703, 14.267) -> 11.018\n        hour1: (13.865, 8.573, 7.502, 12.257) -> 10.549\n        hour2: (12.391, 7.167, 7.502, 12.056) -> 9.779\n        hour3: (12.458, 8.239, 8.372, 13.262) -> 10.583\n        hour4: (12.860, 8.774, 8.506, 12.860) -> 10.750\n        hour5: (13.128, 9.109, 8.573, 14.066) -> 11.219\n        hour6: (13.999, 9.042, 8.774, 13.798) -> 11.403\n        hour7: (14.334, 10.181, 10.717, 14.066) -> 12.325\n        hour8: (11.721, 10.583, 11.721, 13.396) -> 11.855\n        hour9: (9.243, 10.181, 9.980, 12.056) -> 10.365\n        hour10: (10.181, 9.846, 9.511, 10.047) -> 9.896\n        hour11: (11.119, 11.721, 10.985, 12.994) -> 11.705\n        hour12: (8.640, 9.645, 8.439, 8.908) -> 8.908\n        hour13: (8.239, 8.707, 9.109, 9.176) -> 8.808\n        hour14: (8.239, 8.640, 9.042, 8.239) -> 8.540\n        hour15: (8.908, 9.042, 9.377, 8.573) -> 8.975\n        hour16: (8.774, 8.774, 10.315, 9.645) -> 9.377\n        hour17: (10.583, 10.650, 11.119, 11.186) -> 10.885\n        hour18: (9.511, 9.779, 10.181, 10.382) -> 9.963\n        hour19: (9.042, 9.243, 10.248, 10.583) -> 9.779\n        hour20: (8.038, 8.372, 9.377, 9.712) -> 8.875\n        hour21: (7.301, 7.301, 8.439, 10.114) -> 8.289\n        hour22: (6.966, 7.837, 9.846, 10.248) -> 8.724\n        hour23: (8.038, 8.841, 14.401, 10.382) -> 10.416\n\n   We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Now, we create the next 96 points:\n\n        Day 5: 2017-01-09: from hour0 to hour23: [11.018, 10.549, 10.416] -> but wait, note: the hour23 we computed is 10.416, but we have to assign the hour order.\n\n        Actually, the hour0 is 00:00, hour1 is 01:00, ... hour23 is 23:00.\n\n        So:\n\n          2017-01-09 00:00:00 -> 11.018\n          2017-01-09 01:00:00 -> 10.549\n          2017-01-09 02:00:00 -> 9.779\n          2017-01-09 03:00:00 -> 10.583\n          2017-01-09 04:00:00 -> 10.750\n          2017-01-09 05:00:00 -> 11.219\n          2017-01-09 06:00:00 -> 11.403\n          2017-01-09 07:00:00 -> 12.325\n          2017-01-09 08:00:00 -> 11.855\n          2017-01-09 09:00:00 -> 10.365\n          2017-01-09 10:00:00 -> 9.896\n          2017-01-09 11:00:00 -> 11.705\n          2017-01-09 12:00:00 -> 8.908\n          2017-01-09 13:00:00 -> 8.808\n          2017-01-09 14:00:00 -> 8.540\n          2017-01-09 15:00:00 -> 8.975\n          2017-01-09 16:00:00 -> 9.377\n          2017-01-09 17:00:00 -> 10.885\n          2017-01-09 18:00:00 -> 9.963\n          2017-01-09 19:00:00 -> 9.779\n          2017-01-09 20:00:00 -> 8.875\n          2017-01-09 21:00:00 -> 8.289\n          2017-01-09 22:00:00 -> 8.724\n          2017-01-09 23:00:00 -> 10.416\n\n        Then for 2017-01-10, we repeat the same 24 numbers:\n\n          2017-01-10 00:00:00 -> 11.018\n          2017-01-10 01:00:00 -> 10.549\n          ... and so on.\n\n        Similarly for 2017-01-11 and 2017-01-12.\n\n   We write the dates accordingly.\n\n   The last date in the given data is 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n\n   The next date is 2017-01-09 00:00:00.\n\n   We generate 96 records: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n   Format: \n        date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n        HUFL: float with 3 decimal places.\n\n   We output in the required format.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided data we don't have missing. And for the forecast, we are generating all 96 points.\n\n   We output the forecast as:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00 11.018\n        2017-01-09 01:00:00 10.549\n        ... \n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the example input has the HUFL aligned? We can just output with space.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output as:\n\n        \"2017-01-09 00:00:00 11.018\"\n\n   However, the example input has a tab or space? The example uses multiple spaces. We can use a single space.\n\n   But the input has:\n\n        \"2017-01-05 00:00:00 13.329\"\n\n   So we output: [date] [space] [HUFL value]\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's code the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-09 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-09 01:00:00 ... until 2017-01-09 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-10 00:00:00 ... until 2017-01-10 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-11 00:00:00 ... until 2017-01-11 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-01-12 00:00:00 ... until 2017-01-12 23:00:00\n\n   We have 4 days.\n\n   We have the 24 averages stored in a list:\n\n        avg[0] = 11.018   -> hour0\n        avg[1] = 10.549   -> hour1\n        ... \n        avg[23] = 10.416  -> hour23\n\n   Then for day in [9,10,11,12]:\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date = f\"2017-01-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            value = avg[hour]\n\n   But note: January 9,10,11,12 are all two-digit.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: after 2017-01-09, then 2017-01-10, etc.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        day = 9,10,11,12\n\n   But note: the month might change? 12 is the last day we need, and January has 31 days, so no problem.\n\n   We output the value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me write the averages again with rounding to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 11.018\n        hour1: 10.549\n        hour2: 9.779\n        hour3: 10.583\n        hour4: 10.750\n        hour5: 11.219\n        hour6: 11.403\n        hour7: 12.325\n        hour8: 11.855\n        hour9: 10.365\n        hour10: 9.896\n        hour11: 11.705\n        hour12: 8.908\n        hour13: 8.808\n        hour14: 8.540\n        hour15: 8.975\n        hour16: 9.377\n        hour17: 10.885\n        hour18: 9.963\n        hour19: 9.779\n        hour20: 8.875\n        hour21: 8.289\n        hour22: 8.724\n        hour23: 10.416\n\n   We'll use these 24 numbers repeated for 4 days.\n\n   Now, we write the output.\n\n   Important: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
