        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load drops during the day (negative values) and rises at night (positive values).\n 2. There are missing values in the provided data? Actually, the user says the data will have missing values, but the provided 96 points seem complete? \n    However, we are to forecast the next 96 points and we must be aware of potential missingness in the future? But the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and has seasonality, we can use a seasonal time series model. Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, \n    we can consider using a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the small amount of data, we can use a simple seasonal naive method, or perhaps a seasonal decomposition followed by forecasting the components. \n    However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n    The data from 2017-02-18 to 2017-02-21 does not show a clear long-term trend over these 4 days, but we do see daily patterns.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. But with only 4 days (96 points) and 24 seasons, \n    we have only 4 seasons. This is very limited for fitting a seasonal model.\n\n 6. Another approach: use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. This is a simple seasonal naive approach.\n\n    For example, to forecast the 00:00:00 of 2017-02-22, we take the average of the 00:00:00 values from 2017-02-18, 2017-02-19, 2017-02-20, 2017-02-21.\n\n    But note: the data for 2017-02-21 00:00:00 is 8.671, 2017-02-20 00:00:00 is 8.209, 2017-02-19 00:00:00 is 8.564, 2017-02-18 00:00:00 is 7.462.\n    Average = (7.462 + 8.564 + 8.209 + 8.671) / 4 = 8.2265.\n\n    Then we do the same for each hour of the day.\n\n 7. However, we note that the pattern might not be exactly the same each day. But with only 4 days, we don't have much variation.\n\n 8. We can also consider a moving window of the last 4 days to forecast the next day, and then for the next 4 days we can use the same pattern? \n    But the problem is we are forecasting 4 days ahead, so we can use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days? \n\n 9. Since the problem does not specify the model and we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we choose the following:\n\n     We will compute the average for each hour of the day (i.e., 0,1,...,23) over the 4 available days, and then use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n     However, note that the next 4 days might have a different overall level? We don't have a trend, so we assume the level is stable.\n\n     Steps:\n        - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n        - Then for the next 96 hours (4 days: 2017-02-22, 2017-02-23, 2017-02-24, 2017-02-25) we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 10. But note: the last provided data point is 2017-02-21 23:00:00. The next 96 hours start from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n 11. How to handle missing values? The problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't see any. \n     However, for the forecast, we are to provide complete data. So we are generating 96 points without missing values.\n\n 12. Implementation:\n\n     We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n     We'll create a list of the 24 hours (0 to 23) and for each hour, we take the average of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n     Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern for each day.\n\n 13. Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-18 00:00:00 -> 7.462\n        Day2: 2017-02-19 00:00:00 -> 8.564\n        Day3: 2017-02-20 00:00:00 -> 8.209\n        Day4: 2017-02-21 00:00:00 -> 8.671\n\n        Average = (7.462 + 8.564 + 8.209 + 8.671) / 4 = 8.2265\n\n     Then for 2017-02-22 00:00:00, 2017-02-23 00:00:00, 2017-02-24 00:00:00, 2017-02-25 00:00:00 we use 8.2265.\n\n     Similarly for other hours.\n\n 14. However, we note that the pattern might be changing? But with only 4 days, we cannot capture a trend in the seasonality. \n     this method is simple and robust.\n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and then average the 4 values we have.\n\n 16. But note: the data provided is exactly 4 days? \n        From 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00 -> that is 4 days * 24 = 96 points. So we have 4 full days.\n\n 17. We'll compute the hourly averages and then replicate them for the next 4 days.\n\n 18. Code to compute the averages (pseudocode):\n\n        hour_avgs = [0]*24\n        for hour in range(24):\n            values = []\n            for day in range(4):\n                index = day*24 + hour\n                values.append(data[index])\n            hour_avgs[hour] = sum(values) / len(values)\n\n 19. Then for the next 96 hours, we assign:\n\n        day0: 2017-02-22 -> hour_avgs[0] to hour_avgs[23]\n        day1: 2017-02-23 -> hour_avgs[0] to hour_avgs[23]\n        day2: 2017-02-24 -> hour_avgs[0] to hour_avgs[23]\n        day3: 2017-02-25 -> hour_avgs[0] to hour_avgs[23]\n\n 20. We must generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 21. Let's do the calculation for the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-22 00:00:00 (next after 2017-02-21 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-02-22 00:00:00, 2017-02-22 01:00:00, ... until 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We'll generate the timestamps and the corresponding MUFL value (which is the average for that hour).\n\n 23. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without gaps.\n\n 24. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MUFL', with the date in the format as given.\n\n 25. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 26. Let's compute the hourly averages from the provided data:\n\n        We'll write a small code in our mind or use a calculator for each hour? \n        But we have 24 hours, so we can do it by grouping.\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: [7.462, 8.564, 8.209, 8.671] -> avg = (7.462+8.564+8.209+8.671)/4 = 32.906/4 = 8.2265\n        Hour 1: [8.671, 8.955, 6.929, 8.813] -> (8.671+8.955+6.929+8.813)/4 = 33.368/4 = 8.342\n        Hour 2: [9.026, 9.630, 8.919, 8.493] -> (9.026+9.630+8.919+8.493)/4 = 36.068/4 = 9.017\n        Hour 3: [7.853, 8.031, 5.330, 8.564] -> (7.853+8.031+5.330+8.564)/4 = 29.778/4 = 7.4445\n        Hour 4: [7.924, 9.737, 7.320, 8.777] -> (7.924+9.737+7.320+8.777)/4 = 33.758/4 = 8.4395\n        Hour 5: [8.599, 9.026, 5.401, 8.813] -> (8.599+9.026+5.401+8.813)/4 = 31.839/4 = 7.95975\n        Hour 6: [9.061, 8.635, 5.828, 7.995] -> (9.061+8.635+5.828+7.995)/4 = 31.519/4 = 7.87975\n        Hour 7: [9.594, 9.594, 7.000, 9.808] -> (9.594+9.594+7.000+9.808)/4 = 36.0/4 = 9.0\n            Actually: 9.594 (day1), 9.594 (day2) -> wait, day2 at 07:00 is 9.594? \n            Let me check: \n                2017-02-18 07:00:00 -> 9.594\n                2017-02-19 07:00:00 -> 9.594\n                2017-02-20 07:00:00 -> 7.000\n                2017-02-21 07:00:00 -> 9.808\n            So: 9.594+9.594+7.000+9.808 = 35.996 -> 8.999\n\n        We'll do the rest similarly.\n\n 27. But note: we are to output 96 points, so we must do all 24 hours.\n\n 28. Alternatively, we can write a small script in our mind? But since we are an AI, we can compute programmatically.\n\n 29. However, to save time, we can compute the averages and then replicate.\n\n 30. We'll compute the averages for each hour and then assign for the next 4 days.\n\n 31. We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 32. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (7.462 + 8.564 + 8.209 + 8.671) / 4 = 8.2265 -> 8.227\n        Hour 1: (8.671 + 8.955 + 6.929 + 8.813) / 4 = 8.342 -> 8.342\n        Hour 2: (9.026 + 9.630 + 8.919 + 8.493) / 4 = 9.017 -> 9.017\n        Hour 3: (7.853 + 8.031 + 5.330 + 8.564) / 4 = 7.4445 -> 7.445\n        Hour 4: (7.924 + 9.737 + 7.320 + 8.777) / 4 = 8.4395 -> 8.440\n        Hour 5: (8.599 + 9.026 + 5.401 + 8.813) / 4 = 7.95975 -> 7.960\n        Hour 6: (9.061 + 8.635 + 5.828 + 7.995) / 4 = 7.87975 -> 7.880\n        Hour 7: (9.594 + 9.594 + 7.000 + 9.808) / 4 = 8.999 -> 8.999\n        Hour 8: (6.112 + 7.995 + 6.325 + 8.280) / 4 = 7.178 -> 7.178\n        Hour 9: (1.848 + 1.421 + 3.980 + 5.543) / 4 = 3.198 -> 3.198\n        Hour 10: (-3.020 + -2.807 + 5.259 + 1.528) / 4 = 0.24 -> 0.240\n        Hour 11: (-6.183 + -7.320 + 5.899 + 1.883) / 4 = -1.18025 -> -1.180\n        Hour 12: (-9.808 + -10.092 + 4.158 + -5.188) / 4 = -5.2325 -> -5.233\n        Hour 13: (-9.026 + -9.488 + 4.904 + 0.000) / 4 = -3.4025 -> -3.403\n        Hour 14: (-7.747 + -4.264 + 4.371 + 0.426) / 4 = -1.8035 -> -1.804\n        Hour 15: (-5.437 + -4.300 + 3.660 + 0.711) / 4 = -1.3415 -> -1.342\n        Hour 16: (-1.137 + -0.782 + 4.477 + 3.873) / 4 = 1.60775 -> 1.608\n        Hour 17: (3.411 + 3.873 + 5.508 + 5.757) / 4 = 4.63725 -> 4.637\n        Hour 18: (5.010 + 4.655 + 5.757 + 5.828) / 4 = 5.3125 -> 5.313\n        Hour 19: (5.686 + 5.330 + 6.148 + 5.863) / 4 = 5.75675 -> 5.757\n        Hour 20: (5.366 + 4.477 + 5.721 + 5.437) / 4 = 5.25025 -> 5.250\n        Hour 21: (5.259 + 3.873 + 6.396 + 4.939) / 4 = 5.11675 -> 5.117\n        Hour 22: (7.960 + 6.538 + 6.894 + 6.823) / 4 = 7.05375 -> 7.054\n        Hour 23: (10.554 + 8.102 + 7.711 + 8.706) / 4 = 8.76825 -> 8.768\n\n 33. Now, for the next 4 days (2017-02-22 to 2017-02-25), we will assign:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-02-22): \n            00:00:00 -> 8.227\n            01:00:00 -> 8.342\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 8.768\n\n        Day 2 (2017-02-23): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (2017-02-24): same\n        Day 4 (2017-02-25): same\n\n 34. We generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-22 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-22 01:00:00, ... 2017-02-22 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-23 00:00:00, ... 2017-02-23 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-24 00:00:00, ... 2017-02-24 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-25 00:00:00, ... 2017-02-25 23:00:00\n\n 35. We output as:\n\n        <answer>\n               date    MUFL\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00   8.227\n        2017-02-22 01:00:00   8.342\n        ... \n        2017-02-25 23:00:00   8.768\n        </answer>\n\n 36. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 37. Let's write the first few rows for 2017-02-22:\n\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00   8.227\n        2017-02-22 01:00:00   8.342\n        2017-02-22 02:00:00   9.017\n        2017-02-22 03:00:00   7.445\n        2017-02-22 04:00:00   8.440\n        2017-02-22 05:00:00   7.960\n        2017-02-22 06:00:00   7.880\n        2017-02-22 07:00:00   8.999\n        2017-02-22 08:00:00   7.178\n        2017-02-22 09:00:00   3.198\n        2017-02-22 10:00:00   0.240\n        2017-02-22 11:00:00  -1.180\n        2017-02-22 12:00:00  -5.233\n        2017-02-22 13:00:00  -3.403\n        2017-02-22 14:00:00  -1.804\n        2017-02-22 15:00:00  -1.342\n        2017-02-22 16:00:00   1.608\n        2017-02-22 17:00:00   4.637\n        2017-02-22 18:00:00   5.313\n        2017-02-22 19:00:00   5.757\n        2017-02-22 20:00:00   5.250\n        2017-02-22 21:00:00   5.117\n        2017-02-22 22:00:00   7.054\n        2017-02-22 23:00:00   8.768\n\n        Then repeat the same values for the next day (2017-02-23) and so on.\n\n 38. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the history, and for the forecast we are generating without missing.\n\n 39. We output the entire 96 points.\n\n 40. We must follow the format exactly.\n\n 41. We write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n 42. We generate the data as described.\n\n 43. Note: The dates must be in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 44. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta? (But we are not coding, we are writing the output)\n\n        We know the last date in the input is 2017-02-21 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-02-22 00:00:00.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            Day 1: 2017-02-22\n            Day 2: 2017-02-23\n            Day 3: 2017-02-24\n            Day 4: 2017-02-25\n\n        And for each day, we have 24 hours: 00:00:00, 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00.\n\n 45. We'll write the data in a fixed-width or with the same alignment? The example input had the dates aligned.\n\n 46. We output the data in the same way: two columns, with the date string and the MUFL value (rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n 47. We'll write the entire 96 rows.\n\n 48. Since it's a lot, we do it programmatically in our mind? We have the 24 averages, and we repeat them 4 times.\n\n 49. We list the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: 8.227\n        hour1: 8.342\n        hour2: 9.017\n        hour3: 7.445\n        hour4: 8.440\n        hour5: 7.960\n        hour6: 7.880\n        hour7: 8.999\n        hour8: 7.178\n        hour9: 3.198\n        hour10: 0.240\n        hour11: -1.180\n        hour12: -5.233\n        hour13: -3.403\n        hour14: -1.804\n        hour15: -1.342\n        hour16: 1.608\n        hour17: 4.637\n        hour18: 5.313\n        hour19: 5.757\n        hour20: 5.250\n        hour21: 5.117\n        hour22: 7.054\n        hour23: 8.768\n\n 50. Now, for each day in [22,23,24,25] of February 2017, we assign these 24 values.\n\n 51. We write:\n\n        for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            day = 22 + day_offset\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-02-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = hour_avgs[hour]\n\n 52. But note: the day must be two digits: 22, 23, 24, 25 -> all two digits.\n\n 53. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00   8.227\n        2017-02-22 01:00:00   8.342\n        2017-02-22 02:00:00   9.017\n        2017-02-22 03:00:00   7.445\n        2017-02-22 04:00:00   8.440\n        2017-02-22 05:00:00   7.960\n        2017-02-22 06:00:00   7.880\n        2017-02-22 07:00:00   8.999\n        2017-02-22 08:00:00   7.178\n        2017-02-22 09:00:00   3.198\n        2017-02-22 10:00:00   0.240\n        2017-02-22 11:00:00  -1.180\n        2017-02-22 12:00:00  -5.233\n        2017-02-22 13:00:00  -3.403\n        2017-02-22 14:00:00  -1.804\n        2017-02-22 15:00:00  -1.342\n        2017-02-22 16:00:00   1.608\n        2017-02-22 17:00:00   4.637\n        2017-02-22 18:00:00   5.313\n        2017-02-22 19:00:00   5.757\n        2017-02-22 20:00:00   5.250\n        2017-02-22 21:00:00   5.117\n        2017-02-22 22:00:00   7.054\n        2017-02-22 23:00:00   8.768\n\n        Then for 2017-02-23: same values again.\n\n        ...\n\n        And for 2017-02-25: same values.\n\n 54. We write the entire 96 rows.\n\n 55. Since the output is long, we must be careful.\n\n 56. We output in the required format.\n\n 57. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 58. We output the 96 rows without omission.\n\n 59. We write the answer in the following way:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00   8.227\n        2017-02-22 01:00:00   8.342\n        ... (all 96 rows)\n        </answer>\n\n 60. We'll generate the full list below.\n\n 61. However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", so we are giving 96 points.\n\n 62. We are done.\n",
