        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive hours without missing values? \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points seem complete? We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 2. We must handle the time series appropriately. Since the data is hourly and shows daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 3. Given the constraints of the problem and that we are to provide a complete forecast for 96 points, we choose a method that can handle seasonality and is robust.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal decomposition method or SARIMA model. However, without the ability to run code here, we must rely on a heuristic or a simple method.\n\n 5. But note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 6. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, we must generate 96 timestamps and corresponding MULL values.\n\n 7. We can use a simple approach: \n    - The data ends at 2017-02-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours will be from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n\n 8. However, without a model, we must simulate a forecast. But note: we are an expert, so we can use a standard method.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we cannot run code, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n    - Use the last observed cycle (last 24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would be too naive and ignore trends.\n\n10. Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous 4 days for each hour? \n\n    For example, for the hour 00:00:00, we take the values at 00:00:00 of 2017-02-10, 2017-02-11, 2017-02-12, 2017-02-13 and average them? \n    Then use that as the forecast for 2017-02-14 00:00:00, 2017-02-15 00:00:00, etc.\n\n    But note: the data shows a pattern that might change? However, without more context, this is a simple and common approach.\n\n11. Let's calculate the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days we have:\n\n    We have:\n        Day1: 2017-02-10 (Friday)\n        Day2: 2017-02-11 (Saturday)\n        Day3: 2017-02-12 (Sunday)\n        Day4: 2017-02-13 (Monday)\n\n    The next 4 days would be:\n        2017-02-14 (Tuesday)\n        2017-02-15 (Wednesday)\n        2017-02-16 (Thursday)\n        2017-02-17 (Friday)\n\n    We might expect similar patterns? But note: weekdays vs weekends? The provided 4 days include a weekend and a Monday.\n\n    However, we only have 4 days. We can compute the average for each hour across these 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the problem does not specify the day of the week effect? We don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only 4 days). So we assume daily seasonality only.\n\n12. Steps for the average method:\n\n    For each hour in the day (0 to 23):\n        Let values = [value at that hour from day1, day2, day3, day4]\n        average = mean(values)\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, for each day, we assign the average for that hour.\n\n13. However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day? We might need to adjust for a possible trend? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n14. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-13) as the base and adjust by the average daily pattern? But the problem says to forecast 96 points.\n\n15. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide an answer, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n16. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 00:00: [2017-02-10: -2.168, 2017-02-11: -2.025, 2017-02-12: -2.452, 2017-02-13: -1.173] -> average = (-2.168 -2.025 -2.452 -1.173)/4 = -7.818/4 = -1.9545\n    Hour 01:00: [-2.203, -1.883, -2.807, -1.244] -> (-2.203-1.883-2.807-1.244)/4 = -8.137/4 = -2.03425\n    ... and so on.\n\n17. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n18. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n    Day1: 2017-02-14: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n    Day2: 2017-02-15: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n    Day3: 2017-02-16: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n    Day4: 2017-02-17: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n\n19. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? However, we are forecasting and we are to provide complete data. So we output 96 numbers.\n\n20. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n    Start: 2017-02-14 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n\n21. We'll compute the averages for each hour and then repeat that pattern 4 times.\n\n22. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n    We'll index the data by hour of day:\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00): [2017-02-10: -2.168, 2017-02-11: -2.025, 2017-02-12: -2.452, 2017-02-13: -1.173] -> avg = (-2.168 -2.025 -2.452 -1.173)/4 = -7.818/4 = -1.9545\n    Hour 1 (01:00): [-2.203, -1.883, -2.807, -1.244] -> (-2.203-1.883-2.807-1.244) = -8.137 -> -2.03425\n    Hour 2 (02:00): [-2.345, -1.848, -2.559, -0.817] -> (-2.345-1.848-2.559-0.817)= -7.569 -> -1.89225\n    Hour 3 (03:00): [-2.416, -2.061, -2.203, -1.350] -> (-2.416-2.061-2.203-1.350)= -8.03 -> -2.0075\n    Hour 4 (04:00): [-2.310, -1.954, -2.523, -1.919] -> (-2.310-1.954-2.523-1.919)= -8.706 -> -2.1765\n    Hour 5 (05:00): [-2.416, -2.559, -2.310, -1.848] -> (-2.416-2.559-2.310-1.848)= -9.133 -> -2.28325\n    Hour 6 (06:00): [-2.452, -1.919, -2.203, -1.350] -> (-2.452-1.919-2.203-1.350)= -7.924 -> -1.981\n    Hour 7 (07:00): [-2.594, -2.097, -2.310, -1.954] -> (-2.594-2.097-2.310-1.954)= -8.955 -> -2.23875\n    Hour 8 (08:00): [-1.954, -1.990, -2.097, -1.102] -> (-1.954-1.990-2.097-1.102)= -7.143 -> -1.78575\n    Hour 9 (09:00): [-1.244, -1.421, -1.528, -0.497] -> (-1.244-1.421-1.528-0.497)= -4.69 -> -1.1725\n    Hour 10 (10:00): [-0.533, -0.640, -0.959, -0.604] -> (-0.533-0.640-0.959-0.604)= -2.736 -> -0.684\n    Hour 11 (11:00): [0.178, -0.107, -0.462, -0.071] -> (0.178-0.107-0.462-0.071)= -0.462 -> -0.1155\n    Hour 12 (12:00): [0.213, -0.249, -0.462, -0.782] -> (0.213-0.249-0.462-0.782)= -1.28 -> -0.32\n    Hour 13 (13:00): [0.213, 0.000, -0.284, 0.249] -> (0.213+0.000-0.284+0.249)= 0.178 -> 0.0445\n    Hour 14 (14:00): [-0.071, -0.462, -0.355, -0.107] -> (-0.071-0.462-0.355-0.107)= -0.995 -> -0.24875\n    Hour 15 (15:00): [-0.675, -1.492, -0.711, -1.386] -> (-0.675-1.492-0.711-1.386)= -4.264 -> -1.066\n    Hour 16 (16:00): [-1.777, -1.919, -1.492, -1.208] -> (-1.777-1.919-1.492-1.208)= -6.396 -> -1.599\n    Hour 17 (17:00): [-2.416, -2.487, -2.274, -2.381] -> (-2.416-2.487-2.274-2.381)= -9.558 -> -2.3895\n    Hour 18 (18:00): [-2.914, -2.665, -3.163, -3.020] -> (-2.914-2.665-3.163-3.020)= -11.762 -> -2.9405\n    Hour 19 (19:00): [-2.097, -2.203, -2.097, -2.345] -> (-2.097-2.203-2.097-2.345)= -8.742 -> -2.1855\n    Hour 20 (20:00): [-1.954, -2.132, -2.097, -2.345] -> (-1.954-2.132-2.097-2.345)= -8.528 -> -2.132\n    Hour 21 (21:00): [-2.061, -2.168, -1.954, -3.411] -> (-2.061-2.168-1.954-3.411)= -9.594 -> -2.3985\n    Hour 22 (22:00): [-2.274, -2.274, -0.746, -2.168] -> (-2.274-2.274-0.746-2.168)= -7.462 -> -1.8655\n    Hour 23 (23:00): [-1.599, -2.559, -1.599, -1.848] -> (-1.599-2.559-1.599-1.848)= -7.605 -> -1.90125\n\n23.

We output the data in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple average method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning) but given the constraints, we use this.\n\nLet's write the data:\n",
