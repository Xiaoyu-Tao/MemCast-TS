        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be cautious. Since the provided data is complete, we assume the next 96 might have missing values? But the instruction says to forecast the next 96, so we must provide complete data.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 points. We can use a time series model. Given the data, we can try to identify patterns:\n    - There seems to be daily seasonality (24 hours).\n    - The data does not show a clear trend, but we can model it with a seasonal model.\n\n 4. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) to capture the seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data is only 96 points (4 days). This is a very short series for a seasonal model with 24 periods. \n    We might use a simpler model or use the last available day as a template and adjust.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal approach: use the last day (2016-11-25) as the forecast for the next day (2016-11-26), \n    then the day before (2016-11-24) for 2016-11-27, and so on? But that would be a repetition of the last 4 days? \n    However, the pattern might change.\n\n 7. Given the short history, we can try to compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days?\n    But note: the next 4 days are consecutive and we don't know if there is a weekly pattern (we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly).\n\n 8. Another idea: use the last day (2016-11-25) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n    However, without more data, it's challenging.\n\n 9. We are required to provide the complete data for the next 96 points. We must not omit any.\n\n 10. We decide to use a simple method: \n     - Compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we use the average for each hour.\n\n 11. This method will give a repeating daily pattern. It is simple and handles the seasonality.\n\n 12. Steps for averaging:\n      - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n 13. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough to model trend. So we ignore trend.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-25) and then adjust by the overall average of the day? \n     However, the problem says to forecast 96 points (4 days). We can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 15. We choose the average method because it smooths out some noise.\n\n 16. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0: (5.425 + 4.823 + 3.952 + 2.947) / 4 = (5.425, 4.823, 3.952, 2.947) -> 4.28675\n      hour1: (4.823, 5.023, 3.952, 3.952) -> 4.4375\n      ... and so on.\n\n 17. Then, for the next 4 days (2016-11-26 to 2016-11-29), we assign the hour0 average to 2016-11-26 00:00:00, hour1 to 2016-11-26 01:00:00, ... until hour23 for 2016-11-26 23:00:00, and then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 18. However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all in the same week? they are from Tuesday to Friday). \n     The next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? We don't have data for weekend. So we cannot model weekly seasonality.\n\n 19. Therefore, we stick to the average daily pattern.\n\n 20. But note: the last day (2016-11-25) is a Friday? and the next days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? \n     We don't know if the pattern changes on weekends. However, without data for weekends, we have to assume the same pattern.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the entire 96 points to fit a model with daily seasonality and then forecast. \n     We can use a SARIMA(?,?,?)(?,?,?)_24 model. But with only 4 days, the model might not be stable.\n\n 22. Given the constraints, we choose the averaging method.\n\n 23. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We have 4 days, 24 hours per day -> 4 values per hour.\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n 24. The data:\n\n      Day1: 2016-11-22 (Tuesday): 24 values\n      Day2: 2016-11-23 (Wednesday): 24 values\n      Day3: 2016-11-24 (Thursday): 24 values\n      Day4: 2016-11-25 (Friday): 24 values\n\n 25. We'll group by the hour of the day.\n\n 26. How to compute:\n\n      hour0: [5.425, 4.823, 3.952, 2.947] -> mean = (5.425+4.823+3.952+2.947)/4 = 4.28675\n      hour1: [4.823, 5.023, 3.952, 3.952] -> (4.823+5.023+3.952+3.952)/4 = 4.4375\n      hour2: [4.689, 5.827, 4.287, 3.684] -> (4.689+5.827+4.287+3.684)/4 = 4.62175\n      hour3: [5.090, 5.358, 4.622, 3.952] -> (5.090+5.358+4.622+3.952)/4 = 4.7555\n      hour4: [5.358, 5.291, 3.550, 3.416] -> (5.358+5.291+3.550+3.416)/4 = 4.40375\n      hour5: [4.220, 5.157, 4.019, 3.818] -> (4.220+5.157+4.019+3.818)/4 = 4.3035\n      hour6: [4.622, 4.957, 3.349, 3.282] -> (4.622+4.957+3.349+3.282)/4 = 4.0525\n      hour7: [5.760, 5.157, 4.555, 3.550] -> (5.760+5.157+4.555+3.550)/4 = 4.7555\n      hour8: [5.425, 4.287, 4.622, 4.354] -> (5.425+4.287+4.622+4.354)/4 = 4.672\n      hour9: [4.086, 2.411, 3.952, 3.751] -> (4.086+2.411+3.952+3.751)/4 = 3.55\n      hour10: [3.818, 2.880, 3.550, 3.349] -> (3.818+2.880+3.550+3.349)/4 = 3.39925\n      hour11: [3.550, 3.550, 3.684, 4.086] -> (3.550+3.550+3.684+4.086)/4 = 3.7175\n      hour12: [3.148, 2.813, 2.545, 2.009] -> (3.148+2.813+2.545+2.009)/4 = 2.62875\n      hour13: [3.818, 2.612, 3.885, 3.014] -> (3.818+2.612+3.885+3.014)/4 = 3.33225\n      hour14: [3.885, 4.086, 4.153, 4.555] -> (3.885+4.086+4.153+4.555)/4 = 4.16975\n      hour15: [3.550, 4.019, 3.885, 4.153] -> (3.550+4.019+3.885+4.153)/4 = 3.90175\n      hour16: [3.215, 3.483, 3.215, 3.148] -> (3.215+3.483+3.215+3.148)/4 = 3.26525\n      hour17: [3.014, 3.014, 2.880, 3.416] -> (3.014+3.014+2.880+3.416)/4 = 3.081\n      hour18: [2.344, 2.545, 2.478, 2.746] -> (2.344+2.545+2.478+2.746)/4 = 2.52825\n      hour19: [2.076, 1.808, 2.679, 2.545] -> (2.076+1.808+2.679+2.545)/4 = 2.277\n      hour20: [2.009, 1.674, 2.679, 2.545] -> (2.009+1.674+2.679+2.545)/4 = 2.22675\n      hour21: [0.536, 1.206, 1.608, 2.545] -> (0.536+1.206+1.608+2.545)/4 = 1.47375\n      hour22: [3.483, 2.344, 2.545, 3.282] -> (3.483+2.344+2.545+3.282)/4 = 2.9135\n      hour23: [4.488, 4.086, 3.550, 3.952] -> (4.488+4.086+3.550+3.952)/4 = 4.019\n\n 27. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day5: 2016-11-26 (Saturday): hour0 to hour23: [4.28675, 4.4375, 4.62175, ... , 4.019]\n      Day6: 2016-11-27 (Sunday): same as above\n      Day7: 2016-11-28 (Monday): same\n      Day8: 2016-11-29 (Tuesday): same\n\n 28. But note: the dates must be generated. The last given date is 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n      Next date: 2016-11-26 00:00:00, then 2016-11-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-29 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'\n\n 30. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 31. However, note: the user said the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide complete data. \n     So we output the 96 points without missing.\n\n 32. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 33. Let's code the output:\n\n      dates = pd.date_range(start='2016-11-26 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n      values = [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... , hour23_avg, then repeat 3 more times]\n\n 34. We have the averages for each hour (0 to 23) as computed above.\n\n 35. We'll create a list of the 24 averages and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 36. The averages in order (hour0 to hour23):\n\n      [4.28675, 4.4375, 4.62175, 4.7555, 4.40375, 4.3035, 4.0525, 4.7555, 4.672, 3.55, 3.39925, 3.7175, 2.62875, 3.33225, 4.16975, 3.90175, 3.26525, 3.081, 2.52825, 2.277, 2.22675, 1.47375, 2.9135, 4.019]\n\n 37. Now, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 38. Then, we pair with the date range.\n\n 39. Format the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 40. However, note: the input had up to 3 decimal places, but we computed averages that might have more. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n 41. Let's round the averages:\n\n      hour0: 4.287\n      hour1: 4.438\n      hour2: 4.622\n      hour3: 4.756\n      hour4: 4.404\n      hour5: 4.304\n      hour6: 4.053\n      hour7: 4.756\n      hour8: 4.672\n      hour9: 3.550\n      hour10: 3.399\n      hour11: 3.718\n      hour12: 2.629\n      hour13: 3.332\n      hour14: 4.170\n      hour15: 3.902\n      hour16: 3.265\n      hour17: 3.081\n      hour18: 2.528\n      hour19: 2.277\n      hour20: 2.227\n      hour21: 1.474\n      hour22: 2.914\n      hour23: 4.019\n\n 42. Now, we write the output.\n\n 43. We must output in the exact format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-26 00:00:00 4.287\n2016-11-26 01:00:00 4.438\n... \n2016-11-29 23:00:00 4.019\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 44. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-11-26 00:00:00\n      End:   2016-11-29 23:00:00  (which is 96 hours later)\n\n 45. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 46. Let's code the output.\n\n 47. Note: We are rounding the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. We output the data without the index (just the two columns as in the input example).\n\n 49. We write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 50. We note that the original data had the date as index? But in the example, the date is in the first column and the value in the second.\n\n 51. We output:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2016-11-26 00:00:00 4.287\n        2016-11-26 01:00:00 4.438\n        ... \n\n 52. We do not output the header? The example input had a header. But the instruction says to give the complete data in the same format? \n      The example input had:\n\n               date  HULL\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 5.425\n\n      But in the output, we are to provide only the data? The instruction says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n      We'll output without the header to match the example of the input data (which showed the data without the header in the example).\n\n      Actually, the example input was given without the header in the data block? It showed:\n\n          2016-11-22 00:00:00 5.425\n          2016-11-22 01:00:00 4.823\n\n      But the header was above. Since the instruction says \"complete data\", and the example input included the header? \n      But the example output in the instruction does not show the header? \n\n      The instruction says:\n\n          <answer>\n          \n          ```\n          ...\n          ```\n\n          </answer>\n\n      And the example input they provided started with the data points without the header? Actually, they printed the dataframe without the index and with the date as a column? \n\n      We note that the example input had:\n\n          \"date  HULL\"\n          \"2016-11-22 00:00:00 5.425\"\n\n      But in the output, we are to provide the same two columns? \n\n      However, the instruction says \"remember to give me the complete data\". We'll output without the header because the example input data block did not have the header in the data lines? \n\n      Actually, the example input had:\n\n          2016-11-22 00:00:00 5.425\n\n      So we output without the header.\n\n 53. Therefore, we output 96 lines, each line: \"<date> <value>\", with the value rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 54. We generate the dates in the same string format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 55. Let's do it.\n\n 56. We have the list of 24 values (the averages) and we repeat it 4 times.\n\n 57. The dates: \n        start = datetime(2016, 11,26,0,0,0)  # but note: the last date was 2016-11-25 23:00:00, so next is 2016-11-26 00:00:00\n\n 58. We'll generate the dates with frequency 'H'.\n\n 59. We write the code in our mind to output.\n\n 60. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-26 00:00:00 4.287\n2016-11-26 01:00:00 4.438\n2016-11-26 02:00:00 4.622\n2016-11-26 03:00:00 4.756\n2016-11-26 04:00:00 4.404\n2016-11-26 05:00:00 4.304\n2016-11-26 06:00:00 4.053\n2016-11-26 07:00:00 4.756\n2016-11-26 08:00:00 4.672\n2016-11-26 09:00:00 3.550\n2016-11-26 10:00:00 3.399\n2016-11-26 11:00:00 3.718\n2016-11-26 12:00:00 2.629\n2016-11-26 13:00:00 3.332\n2016-11-26 14:00:00 4.170\n2016-11-26 15:00:00 3.902\n2016-11-26 16:00:00 3.265\n2016-11-26 17:00:00 3.081\n2016-11-26 18:00:00 2.528\n2016-11-26 19:00:00 2.277\n2016-11-26 20:00:00 2.227\n2016-11-26 21:00:00 1.474\n2016-11-26 22:00:00 2.914\n2016-11-26 23:00:00 4.019\n2016-11-27 00:00:00 4.287\n2016-11-27 01:00:00 4.438\n...
