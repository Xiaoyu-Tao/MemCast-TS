        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00) of the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) metric.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive records without any missing time stamps?\n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 records do not have any? \n    We are to be aware that the data might have missing values, but in the given 96 points, we have a complete set.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 3. Since we are dealing with time series, we can use a model that can handle hourly data and capture daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 4. We note that the data has a pattern: \n    - There are peaks during the day and lower values at night.\n    - Also, we see that the values on 2017-02-13 00:00 and 01:00 are unusually high (1.980 and 2.041) compared to the rest? \n      But then it drops. This might be an anomaly or a data error? However, we are to forecast based on the given data.\n\n 5. We can use a model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n\n 6. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we must be cautious.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the series to trend, seasonal, and residual.\n    - But note: we have only 4 days, so the seasonal component (daily) can be estimated by averaging the same hour across the 4 days? \n      However, 4 days is very short.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the previous days to form a daily profile, and then adjust by the overall level.\n\n 9. However, we notice that the data does not have a clear trend over the 4 days, but there is a daily pattern.\n\n 10. We can try to compute the hourly average for the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n     But that would ignore any trend and also the anomaly on the 13th at midnight.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a moving window or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we will use a simple approach: \n     - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the available 4 days, but we note that the 13th has an anomaly at hour 0 and 1.\n     - We might want to use median to avoid the anomaly? Or we can use the anomaly as part of the pattern? \n       However, the problem says the data has missing values, but we don't have missing in the given, but we are to be aware of missing values? \n       But in the given 96 points, we have no missing.\n\n 13. Since the anomaly is only at two points, and we are not sure if it is a pattern (like every Sunday night? But 10th, 11th, 12th are Friday, Saturday, Sunday? and 13th is Monday) \n     - 2017-02-10: Friday, 2017-02-11: Saturday, 2017-02-12: Sunday, 2017-02-13: Monday.\n     - The high values at 00:00 and 01:00 on Monday might be a pattern? But we don't have enough Mondays to check.\n\n 14. Given the ambiguity, we will use the median for each hour of the day to avoid the effect of the anomaly.\n\n 15. Steps for the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 (which is a Tuesday) to 2017-02-17 23:00:00 (Friday).\n\n 16. We compute the median for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days of data we have? But note: the 4 days are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. \n     The next 4 days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So we cannot directly use the same pattern? \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the entire 96 points to fit a model. We can use a seasonal decomposition and then project the seasonal component.\n\n 18. We will use the following:\n     - We have a seasonal period of 24 (hourly data, daily seasonality).\n     - We can use the `statsmodels` library to decompose the series? But we are not coding, we are reasoning.\n\n 19. Since we are to provide the forecast, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the available days, but we only have 4 days.\n\n 20. We note that the data for the same hour might vary by day of week? But we don't have enough data to model day of week.\n\n 21. Therefore, we will ignore the day of week and just use the median for each hour across the 4 days.\n\n 22. How to handle the anomaly? The median will be robust to the two high values? \n     For hour 0: \n        Friday: 0.670, Saturday: 0.609, Sunday: 0.548, Monday: 1.980 -> sorted: 0.548, 0.609, 0.670, 1.980 -> median = (0.609+0.670)/2 = 0.6395\n     For hour 1:\n        Friday: 0.670, Saturday: 0.609, Sunday: 0.518, Monday: 2.041 -> sorted: 0.518, 0.609, 0.670, 2.041 -> median = (0.609+0.670)/2 = 0.6395\n\n 23. But note: the next 4 days are Tuesday to Friday. We don't have a Tuesday in the training. So we are using the same pattern for every day.\n\n 24. We will generate the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour median pattern 4 times.\n\n 25. Steps:\n     a. Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the median for each hour.\n     b. Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat the 24 medians 4 times.\n\n 26. However, we must note that the data might have a trend? But 4 days is too short to see a trend. We can assume the level is constant.\n\n 27. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     hour0: [0.670, 0.609, 0.548, 1.980] -> median = 0.6395\n     hour1: [0.670, 0.609, 0.518, 2.041] -> median = 0.6395\n     hour2: [0.548, 0.670, 0.457, 0.548] -> sorted: 0.457, 0.548, 0.548, 0.670 -> median = (0.548+0.548)/2 = 0.548\n     hour3: [0.640, 0.670, 0.426, 0.487] -> sorted: 0.426, 0.487, 0.640, 0.670 -> median = (0.487+0.640)/2 = 0.5635\n     hour4: [0.640, 0.609, 0.396, 0.579] -> sorted: 0.396, 0.579, 0.609, 0.640 -> median = (0.579+0.609)/2 = 0.594\n     hour5: [0.640, 0.457, 0.366, 0.609] -> sorted: 0.366, 0.457, 0.609, 0.640 -> median = (0.457+0.609)/2 = 0.533\n     hour6: [0.579, 0.457, 0.396, 0.609] -> sorted: 0.396, 0.457, 0.579, 0.609 -> median = (0.457+0.579)/2 = 0.518\n     hour7: [0.640, 0.426, 0.609, 0.670] -> sorted: 0.426, 0.609, 0.640, 0.670 -> median = (0.609+0.640)/2 = 0.6245\n     hour8: [0.761, 0.548, 0.883, 0.853] -> sorted: 0.548, 0.761, 0.853, 0.883 -> median = (0.761+0.853)/2 = 0.807\n     hour9: [0.701, 0.761, 0.975, 0.944] -> sorted: 0.701, 0.761, 0.944, 0.975 -> median = (0.761+0.944)/2 = 0.8525\n     hour10: [0.822, 0.822, 1.066, 1.005] -> sorted: 0.822, 0.822, 1.005, 1.066 -> median = (0.822+1.005)/2 = 0.9135\n     hour11: [0.701, 0.701, 0.883, 1.036] -> sorted: 0.701, 0.701, 0.883, 1.036 -> median = (0.701+0.883)/2 = 0.792\n     hour12: [0.609, 0.701, 0.761, 0.822] -> sorted: 0.609, 0.701, 0.761, 0.822 -> median = (0.701+0.761)/2 = 0.731\n     hour13: [0.701, 0.792, 0.944, 0.883] -> sorted: 0.701, 0.792, 0.883, 0.944 -> median = (0.792+0.883)/2 = 0.8375\n     hour14: [0.640, 0.731, 0.883, 0.944] -> sorted: 0.640, 0.731, 0.883, 0.944 -> median = (0.731+0.883)/2 = 0.807\n     hour15: [0.701, 0.853, 1.005, 0.975] -> sorted: 0.701, 0.853, 0.975, 1.005 -> median = (0.853+0.975)/2 = 0.914\n     hour16: [0.640, 0.761, 0.914, 0.792] -> sorted: 0.640, 0.761, 0.792, 0.914 -> median = (0.761+0.792)/2 = 0.7765\n     hour17: [0.609, 0.640, 0.670, 0.883] -> sorted: 0.609, 0.640, 0.670, 0.883 -> median = (0.640+0.670)/2 = 0.655\n     hour18: [0.609, 0.579, 0.822, 0.822] -> sorted: 0.579, 0.609, 0.822, 0.822 -> median = (0.609+0.822)/2 = 0.7155\n     hour19: [0.609, 0.761, 0.701, 0.701] -> sorted: 0.609, 0.701, 0.701, 0.761 -> median = (0.701+0.701)/2 = 0.701\n     hour20: [0.701, 0.701, 0.670, 0.670] -> sorted: 0.670, 0.670, 0.701, 0.701 -> median = (0.670+0.701)/2 = 0.6855\n     hour21: [0.579, 0.579, 0.701, 0.609] -> sorted: 0.579, 0.579, 0.609, 0.701 -> median = (0.579+0.609)/2 = 0.594\n     hour22: [0.640, 0.518, 0.518, 0.579] -> sorted: 0.518, 0.518, 0.579, 0.640 -> median = (0.518+0.579)/2 = 0.5485\n     hour23: [0.609, 0.518, 0.670, 0.609] -> sorted: 0.518, 0.609, 0.609, 0.670 -> median = (0.609+0.609)/2 = 0.609\n\n 28. Now, we create the 24-hour pattern:\n\n     hour0: 0.6395\n     hour1: 0.6395\n     hour2: 0.548\n     hour3: 0.5635\n     hour4: 0.594\n     hour5: 0.533\n     hour6: 0.518\n     hour7: 0.6245\n     hour8: 0.807\n     hour9: 0.8525\n     hour10: 0.9135\n     hour11: 0.792\n     hour12: 0.731\n     hour13: 0.8375\n     hour14: 0.807\n     hour15: 0.914\n     hour16: 0.7765\n     hour17: 0.655\n     hour18: 0.7155\n     hour19: 0.701\n     hour20: 0.6855\n     hour21: 0.594\n     hour22: 0.5485\n     hour23: 0.609\n\n 29. Then we repeat this pattern 4 days: \n     Day1: 2017-02-14 (Tuesday) from 00:00 to 23:00\n     Day2: 2017-02-15 (Wednesday)\n     Day3: 2017-02-16 (Thursday)\n     Day4: 2017-02-17 (Friday)\n\n 30. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-02-14 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-02-14 01:00:00, ... until 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n\n 31. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'\n\n 32. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. Let's round the medians to 3 decimal places:\n\n     hour0: 0.640\n     hour1: 0.640\n     hour2: 0.548\n     hour3: 0.564\n     hour4: 0.594\n     hour5: 0.533\n     hour6: 0.518\n     hour7: 0.624\n     hour8: 0.807\n     hour9: 0.853\n     hour10: 0.914\n     hour11: 0.792\n     hour12: 0.731\n     hour13: 0.838\n     hour14: 0.807\n     hour15: 0.914\n     hour16: 0.776\n     hour17: 0.655\n     hour18: 0.716\n     hour19: 0.701\n     hour20: 0.686\n     hour21: 0.594\n     hour22: 0.549\n     hour23: 0.609\n\n 34. Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n    2017-02-14 00:00:00 0.640\n    2017-02-14 01:00:00 0.640\n    2017-02-14 02:00:00 0.548\n    ... until\n    2017-02-14 23:00:00 0.609\n\n    then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 35. We note: the last given date is 2017-02-13 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-02-14 00:00:00.\n\n 36. We generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 37. We output in the required format.\n\n 38. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast. \n     are not given any missing values in the input, and we are generating a complete set.\n\n 39. We write the answer in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\ndate,LULL\n2017-02-14 00:00:00,0.640\n2017-02-14 01:00:00,0.640\n2017-02-14 02:00:00,0.548\n...\n2017-02-17 23:00:00,0.609\n```\n\n    But note: the original data had the index as the date? We are to output two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'\n\n 40. We generate 96 lines.\n\n Let's do it step by step for the first day:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-02-14\n        00:00:00 -> 0.640\n        01:00:00 -> 0.640\n        02:00:00 -> 0.548\n        03:00:00 -> 0.564\n        04:00:00 -> 0.594\n        05:00:00 -> 0.533\n        06:00:00 -> 0.518\n        07:00:00 -> 0.624\n        08:00:00 -> 0.807\n        09:00:00 -> 0.853\n        10:00:00 -> 0.914\n        11:00:00 -> 0.792\n        12:00:00 -> 0.731\n        13:00:00 -> 0.838\n        14:00:00 -> 0.807\n        15:00:00 -> 0.914\n        16:00:00 -> 0.776\n        17:00:00 -> 0.655\n        18:00:00 -> 0.716\n        19:00:00 -> 0.701\n        20:00:00 -> 0.686\n        21:00:00 -> 0.594\n        22:00:00 -> 0.549\n        23:00:00 -> 0.609\n\n    Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 41.
