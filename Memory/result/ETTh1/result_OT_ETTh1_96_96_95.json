        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can consider:\n    - SARIMA: to capture both daily seasonality (24 hours) and potential weekly patterns (though we have only 4 days, so weekly might not be captured).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n    - Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 steps, we must be cautious.\n\n 3. However, note that the data is only 4 days. We have 96 points (4*24). This is a very short history for modeling seasonality. But we can see a daily pattern.\n\n 4. Let's plan:\n    - We observe that the temperature has a daily cycle: it rises during the day and falls at night.\n    - We can try to model with a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we will use a simple approach: \n    - We can use the last available day (2017-07-19) as a base and adjust with the average daily pattern? But that might not capture trends.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a model like SARIMA. We'll try to fit a SARIMA model with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24).\n\n 7. But note: we are required to provide the next 96 points. We must handle any missing values in the input? The input provided does not missing, so we can proceed.\n\n 8. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points there are no missing. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 9. We'll use the following steps in code (but we are not coding, we are reasoning as an expert and then generating the forecast):\n\n    - We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). We can see the pattern by looking at the same hour of the day.\n\n    - We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the last day's level? But we also see a trend? Let's check:\n\n        Day 1 (07-16): min ~22.16, max ~26.66\n        Day 2 (07-17): min ~22.72, max ~27.93\n        Day 3 (07-18): min ~21.31, max ~24.90\n        Day 4 (07-19): min ~20.68, max ~24.97\n\n    There is a drop on day 3 and 4? But we are to forecast the next 4 days. Without more history, it's challenging.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without running actual code (as we are an expert in a conversation), we decide to use a simple method:\n\n     - We'll take the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n     - But we note that the last day (07-19) was cooler than the first two. We might adjust the level by the last day's average? \n\n     - Alternatively, we can use the last day (07-19) as the base and then add the average daily deviation from the mean of the day? \n\n 11. However, a more robust way is to use the average of the last two days? or the entire 4 days? \n\n 12. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for hour 0: \n        07-16: 22.299999\n        07-17: 22.722000\n        07-18: 24.621000\n        07-19: 21.315001\n\n     The average for hour0: (22.30 + 22.72 + 24.62 + 21.32) / 4 = (90.96) / 4 = 22.74\n\n     But we see a drop on the last day. We might want to use a weighted average? \n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent days.\n\n 14. Given the ambiguity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we decide to use the average of the last two days for each hour? \n\n     Why two? Because the last two days might be more representative of the current trend.\n\n 15. Steps for each hour (0 to 23) for the next 4 days (so 96 hours):\n\n     For hour i in [0,23]:\n        value_i = (value from day3 at hour i + value from day4 at hour i) / 2\n\n     Then we use these 24 values and repeat them for the next 4 days? \n\n     But that would be 4 identical days? \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire 4 days for each hour? \n\n     Then the next 4 days would be the same pattern? \n\n 17. We note that the problem does not specify the time of year? But we are in July, so we don't expect a strong trend over 4 days? \n\n 18. However, we see a drop in the last day. We might assume that the next day (day5) will be similar to the last day? \n\n 19. We can also to add a small adjustment for the overall trend? \n\n     The overall average of the first day: ~23.5, second day: ~24.8, third day: ~22.8, fourth day: ~21.8 -> downward trend? \n\n     But 4 days is too short to establish a trend. \n\n 20. Given the above, we decide to use the average of the last two days for each hour to form the pattern for the next day, and then for the next 4 days we use that pattern but adjust by a linear trend? \n\n     However, without more data, we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n 21. We'll do:\n\n     For each hour i (0 to 23):\n        base_i = (value from 2017-07-18 at hour i + value from 2017-07-19 at hour i) / 2\n\n     Then the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n        Day1 (2017-07-20): base_0, base_1, ... base_23\n        Day2 (2017-07-21): base_0, base_1, ... base_23\n        Day3 (2017-07-22): base_0, base_1, ... base_23\n        Day4 (2017-07-23): base_0, base_1, ... base_23\n\n 22. But we note that the last two days are cooler. So we are forecasting a cooler pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 23. However, we must also consider that the last two days might be a weekend? We don't have the day of the week. \n\n 24. Since we don't have more context, we'll proceed with the above.\n\n 25. Let's compute the base_i for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (24.621000 + 21.315001) / 2 = 22.968\n     Hour 1: (23.777000 + 21.525999) / 2 = 22.6515\n     Hour 2: (24.340000 + 21.315001) / 2 = 22.8275   -> wait, we have to align by hour of the day.\n\n     Actually, we have:\n\n        2017-07-18 00:00:00 -> 24.621000\n        2017-07-19 00:00:00 -> 21.315001\n\n        2017-07-18 01:00:00 -> 23.777000\n        2017-07-19 01:00:00 -> 21.525999\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 26. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (24.621000 + 21.315001) / 2 = 22.9680005\n        hour1: (23.777000 + 21.525999) / 2 = 22.6514995\n        hour2: (24.340000 + 21.315001) / 2 = 22.8275005   -> but wait, the hour2 of 2017-07-19 is 21.315001? \n            Actually, 2017-07-19 02:00:00 is 21.315001? \n\n        Let me check the data:\n\n            2017-07-18 00:00:00 24.621000\n            2017-07-18 01:00:00 23.777000\n            2017-07-18 02:00:00 24.340000\n            ...\n\n            2017-07-19 00:00:00 21.315001\n            2017-07-19 01:00:00 21.525999\n            2017-07-19 02:00:00 21.315001   -> actually, the 02:00:00 on 2017-07-19 is 21.315001? \n\n        So:\n\n            hour0: 24.621000 (18th) and 21.315001 (19th) -> 22.968\n            hour1: 23.777000 (18th) and 21.525999 (19th) -> 22.6515\n            hour2: 24.340000 (18th) and 21.315001 (19th) -> 22.8275\n            hour3: 23.566000 (18th) and 21.034000 (19th) -> 22.3\n            hour4: 24.551001 (18th) and 21.245001 (19th) -> 22.898\n            hour5: 23.988001 (18th) and 21.034000 (19th) -> 22.511\n            hour6: 23.707001 (18th) and 20.681999 (19th) -> 22.1945\n            hour7: 24.270000 (18th) and 21.174000 (19th) -> 22.722\n            hour8: 24.129000 (18th) and 22.370001 (19th) -> 23.2495\n            hour9: 22.511000 (18th) and 21.455999 (19th) -> 21.9835\n            hour10: 22.441000 (18th) and 20.752001 (19th) -> 21.5965\n            hour11: 22.580999 (18th) and 19.908001 (19th) -> 21.2445\n            hour12: 23.426001 (18th) and 20.612000 (19th) -> 22.019\n            hour13: 23.355000 (18th) and 20.330000 (19th) -> 21.8425\n            hour14: 23.003000 (18th) and 22.299999 (19th) -> 22.6515\n            hour15: 23.636999 (18th) and 23.426001 (19th) -> 23.5315\n            hour16: 24.129000 (18th) and 23.988001 (19th) -> 24.0585\n            hour17: 24.903000 (18th) and 24.973000 (19th) -> 24.938\n            hour18: 24.059000 (18th) and 23.636999 (19th) -> 23.848\n            hour19: 23.988001 (18th) and 22.299999 (19th) -> 23.144\n            hour20: 21.948000 (18th) and 21.667000 (19th) -> 21.8075\n            hour21: 21.737000 (18th) and 21.667000 (19th) -> 21.702\n            hour22: 21.878000 (18th) and 21.525999 (19th) -> 21.702\n            hour23: 21.808001 (18th) and 21.525999 (19th) -> 21.667\n\n 27. Then the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-20 00:00:00: 22.968\n               2017-07-20 01:00:00: 22.6515\n               ... until 23:00:00: 21.667\n\n        Day2: 2017-07-21: same 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-07-22: same\n        Day4: 2017-07-23: same\n\n 28. But we must format the dates correctly. The next day after 2017-07-19 is 2017-07-20.\n\n 29. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-20 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-20 01:00:00 ... up to 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 31. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places? We see up to 6 decimal digits. We'll round to 3 decimal places? \n\n     The data provided has up to 6 decimal places, but we can output with 3 decimal places? \n\n     But the example: 22.299999 -> we can output 22.300? \n\n     However, the problem says \"complete data\", so we should output the same precision? \n\n     We'll output with 6 decimal places to match.\n\n 32. But our computed averages are in more decimals. We'll keep 6 decimal places.\n\n 33. We'll write:\n\n        date, OT\n        2017-07-20 00:00:00, 22.968000\n        2017-07-20 01:00:00, 22.651500\n        ...\n\n 34. However, note: the average of two numbers with 6 decimal places might have more. We'll round to 6 decimal places? \n\n     But the original data has 6 decimal places? Actually, the original data has 3 to 6? \n\n        e.g., 22.299999 -> 6, 22.722000 -> 6, 23.003000 -> 6, etc.\n\n     So we output 6 decimal places.\n\n 35. We'll generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 36. But note: this method is very simplistic. In practice, we would use a more sophisticated model. However, given the constraints (only 4 days of data) and the requirement to provide a forecast, we use this.\n\n 37. We generate the data:\n\n     We have 24 base values (from hour0 to hour23) as above.\n\n     Then we repeat these 24 values 4 times.\n\n 38. The dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-07-20 00:00:00\n     Then add 1 hour until 96 hours.\n\n 39. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-20 00:00:00 22.968000\n2017-07-20 01:00:00 22.651500\n2017-07-23 23:00:00 21.667000\n```\n\n 40. We must be careful: the last hour of the 96 will be 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n\n 41. Let's code the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 7, 20, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 42. But we are not coding, we are writing the data.\n\n 43. We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n 44. The base pattern (24 values) for the 0 to 23 hour:\n\n        hour0: 22.968000\n        hour1: 22.651500\n        hour2: 22.827500\n        hour3: 22.300000   # (23.566000+21.034000)/2 = 22.300000\n        hour4: 22.898001   # (24.551001+21.245001)/2 = 22.898001\n        hour5: 22.511000   # (23.988001+21.034000)/2 = 22.5110005 -> rounded to 6 decimals: 22.511001? But let's compute exactly:\n\n        We'll compute each and round to 6 decimals? Actually, we'll keep the full precision and then format to 6 decimals.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            hour0: (24.621000 + 21.315001) / 2 = 45.936001 / 2 = 22.9680005 -> rounded to 6 decimals: 22.968000? \n            But 22.9680005 rounded to 6 decimals is 22.968001? \n\n        However, the original data has 3 to 6 decimals. We'll output 6 decimals by formatting to 6 decimal places.\n\n        We'll compute:\n\n            hour0: 22.9680005 -> we output 22.968001? \n            But let me check: 24.621000 + 21.315001 = 45.936001 -> divided by 2 is 22.9680005 -> if we round to 6 decimals, it's 22.968001.\n\n        However, the original data does not round, it has exact values. We'll keep the exact average and then format to 6 decimals.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output without rounding?
