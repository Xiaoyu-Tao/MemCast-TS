        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00) of the \"LUFL\" (Low UseFul Load) for a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some irregularities (like the spike on 2016-11-11 00:00:00 to 3.929).\n 2. Given the small amount of data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days ahead, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n 3. We must handle potential missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, the model we choose should be robust to missing values in the future if we were to extend it, but for this task we are only forecasting.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA might be challenging because we don't have many seasonal cycles.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple approach by:\n   - Decomposing the series into trend, seasonality, and residual, but again with 4 days we can only get one full cycle for daily seasonality? Actually, we have 4 cycles of 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data has 96 points (4*24). We can try to extract a daily pattern and then adjust for the last known values.\n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided data, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, and the data is hourly with daily seasonality, we can use:\n   - A seasonal naive method: using the last day (24 to 48 hours ago) as the forecast? But the pattern might change.\n\n But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly repeating. For example, the first day (2016-11-10) has a peak at 17:00 (3.411) and the next day at 17:00 is 2.772, then 3.259, then 2.650.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour? But note the data has a spike on the second day (2016-11-11) at 00:00:00 (3.929) which is unusual.\n\n Considering the requirement for a complete forecast and the short history, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour across days.\n\n Steps for a simple model:\n   - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and take the average of the four days for that hour? But that would be too smooth and ignore any trend.\n\n However, we see that the load on the last day (2016-11-13) is generally lower than the first day? Let's check:\n\n  2016-11-10 00:00:00 -> 1.401\n  2016-11-11 00:00:00 -> 3.929\n  2016-11-12 00:00:00 -> 1.249\n  2016-11-13 00:00:00 -> 4.051\n\n The values at 00:00 are varying. So we might need to account for a trend? But 4 days is too short for a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-13) as the base and then adjust by the average hourly pattern relative to that day? \n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are an expert, we can use a more robust method: Prophet by Facebook or an LSTM. But the problem requires a complete answer and we are in a text-based environment.\n\n Since we cannot run code, we have to rely on a simple method.\n\n Proposed method:\n   Step 1: Compute the hourly average pattern (over the 4 days) for each hour (0 to 23). But note: the data has a non-constant mean? We can de-trend by a daily average?\n\n   Step 2: We can compute the daily average for each day and then the relative seasonal index for each hour.\n\n   However, we don't have a clear trend over the 4 days. Let's compute the daily average:\n\n        Day1 (2016-11-10): average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        Day2: average\n        Day3: average\n        Day4: average\n\n   Then for each hour, we compute the average of (value / daily_avg) for that hour across the 4 days. This gives us a seasonal index for each hour.\n\n   Step 3: For forecasting, we need the daily average for the next 4 days. We can forecast the daily average by taking the average of the last 4 days? Or use a simple moving average? Since we don't have a trend, we can use the last day's daily average? But that might be volatile.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the overall average of the 4 days as the daily average for the next 4 days? \n\n   Step 4: Then the forecast for hour i in day j (j=5,6,7,8) is: \n        forecast = (seasonal_index for hour i) * (forecasted_daily_avg for day j)\n\n   But we are forecasting 4 days, so we need 4 daily averages. We can set each day's daily average as the overall average of the 4 days? \n\n   However, note that the daily average might be changing. We can use the average of the last two days? Or we can use the last day's daily average for all the next 4 days? \n\n   Let me compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2016-11-10): \n            sum = 1.401+1.279+1.127+1.066+1.157+1.432+1.980+2.589+2.589+2.315+2.376+2.833+2.102+2.315+2.102+1.767+2.528+3.411+3.046+2.589+2.315+1.888+1.553+1.492\n            = 1.401+1.279=2.68; +1.127=3.807; +1.066=4.873; +1.157=6.03; +1.432=7.462; +1.980=9.442; +2.589=12.031; +2.589=14.62; +2.315=16.935; +2.376=19.311; +2.833=22.144; +2.102=24.246; +2.315=26.561; +2.102=28.663; +1.767=30.43; +2.528=32.958; +3.411=36.369; +3.046=39.415; +2.589=42.004; +2.315=44.319; +1.888=46.207; +1.553=47.76; +1.492=49.252\n            average = 49.252 / 24 = 2.0521666666666667\n\n        Day2 (2016-11-11): \n            sum = 3.929+3.746+3.716+3.746+3.746+4.051+4.386+5.026+2.467+2.071+2.224+2.772+1.949+1.949+1.736+1.797+1.828+2.772+2.559+2.345+2.163+1.828+1.706+1.432\n            = 3.929+3.746=7.675; +3.716=11.391; +3.746=15.137; +3.746=18.883; +4.051=22.934; +4.386=27.32; +5.026=32.346; +2.467=34.813; +2.071=36.884; +2.224=39.108; +2.772=41.88; +1.949=43.829; +1.949=45.778; +1.736=47.514; +1.797=49.311; +1.828=51.139; +2.772=53.911; +2.559=56.47; +2.345=58.815; +2.163=60.978; +1.828=62.806; +1.706=64.512; +1.432=65.944\n            average = 65.944 / 24 = 2.7476666666666666\n\n        Day3 (2016-11-12):\n            sum = 1.249+1.249+1.097+1.127+1.157+4.325+4.386+5.148+2.894+2.498+2.894+3.411+2.437+2.132+2.376+2.163+2.955+3.259+2.680+2.924+2.284+1.949+1.523+1.614\n            = 1.249+1.249=2.498; +1.097=3.595; +1.127=4.722; +1.157=5.879; +4.325=10.204; +4.386=14.59; +5.148=19.738; +2.894=22.632; +2.498=25.13; +2.894=28.024; +3.411=31.435; +2.437=33.872; +2.132=36.004; +2.376=38.38; +2.163=40.543; +2.955=43.498; +3.259=46.757; +2.680=49.437; +2.924=52.361; +2.284=54.645; +1.949=56.594; +1.523=58.117; +1.614=59.731\n            average = 59.731 / 24 = 2.4887916666666667\n\n        Day4 (2016-11-13):\n            sum = 4.051+3.777+3.655+3.929+3.929+3.929+4.386+4.995+2.345+2.041+2.680+3.015+2.132+2.041+1.949+2.071+2.498+2.650+3.076+2.437+2.071+1.675+1.340+1.401\n            = 4.051+3.777=7.828; +3.655=11.483; +3.929=15.412; +3.929=19.341; +3.929=23.27; +4.386=27.656; +4.995=32.651; +2.345=34.996; +2.041=37.037; +2.680=39.717; +3.015=42.732; +2.132=44.864; +2.041=46.905; +1.949=48.854; +2.071=50.925; +2.498=53.423; +2.650=56.073; +3.076=59.149; +2.437=61.586; +2.071=63.657; +1.675=65.332; +1.340=66.672; +1.401=68.073\n            average = 68.073 / 24 = 2.836375\n\n   The daily averages: [2.052, 2.748, 2.489, 2.836] -> no clear trend.\n\n   We can use the average of these 4 days: (2.052+2.748+2.489+2.836)/4 = (2.052+2.748=4.8; +2.489=7.289; +2.836=10.125) -> 10.125/4 = 2.53125\n\n   Then for each hour (0 to 23) we compute the seasonal index as the average of (value on day1 / 2.052, value on day2 / 2.748, value on day3 / 2.489, value on day4 / 2.836) for that hour.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (from day5 to day8) we use:\n        forecast for hour i in any of the next 4 days = seasonal_index[i] * 2.53125\n\n   But note: the next 4 days are 2016-11-14 to 2016-11-17, which are Monday to Thursday? We don't have day-of-week information. The given data is from Thursday (2016-11-10) to Sunday (2016-11-13). The next days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n   However, we don't have enough data to account for weekly seasonality. So we ignore.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days? So we cannot account for weekly patterns.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   Let's compute the seasonal indices:\n\n        Hour0: \n            Day1: 1.401 / 2.0521666666666667 = 0.6825\n            Day2: 3.929 / 2.7476666666666666 = 1.4300\n            Day3: 1.249 / 2.4887916666666667 = 0.5018\n            Day4: 4.051 / 2.836375 = 1.4283\n            Average = (0.6825+1.4300+0.5018+1.4283)/4 = (0.6825+1.4300=2.1125; +0.5018=2.6143; +1.4283=4.0426) -> 4.0426/4 = 1.01065\n\n        Similarly for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days is: seasonal_index * 2.53125.\n\n   However, note: the average of the daily averages is 2.53125, and the average of the seasonal indices for a full day should be 1.0? Let's check the average of the indices for hour0: 1.01065, which is above 1. So we must normalize the seasonal indices so that the average over 24 hours is 1? \n\n   Actually, the daily average is the average of the 24 values. The seasonal indices are the factors for each hour. The average of the 24 indices should be 1.0. But we computed each index independently. So we can leave as is? Because when we multiply by the daily average, the average of the day will be 2.53125 * (average of the indices for that day). But we want the daily average to be 2.53125? Then we must have the average of the 24 indices for the day equal to 1.0.\n\n   Therefore, we should normalize the indices: divide each index by the average of the 24 indices? But we haven't computed the 24 indices yet.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the indices and then adjust so that the average of the 24 indices is 1.0.\n\n   Steps for indices:\n        Let S_i = ( (v_i1 / A1) + (v_i2 / A2) + (v_i3 / A3) + (v_i4 / A4) ) / 4   for hour i.\n\n        Then we compute the average of S_i for i=0 to 23: \n            total = sum_{i=0}^{23} S_i\n            then normalized index: s_i = S_i * (24 / total)\n\n        Then the forecast for hour i is: s_i * (overall_daily_avg) = s_i * 2.53125\n\n   But note: we are using the same daily average for each day? So the forecast for each day will have the same pattern and the same daily average? \n\n   However, the problem does not to account for a trend, so this is acceptable.\n\n   Let me compute the indices for all 24 hours and then normalize.\n\n   But note: we are in a text environment and 24 hours is a lot. We can do it programmatically in a real environment, but here we have to do by hand? \n\n   Alternatively, we can skip the normalization and hope that the average of the raw indices is 1.0? Let's check:\n\n        The daily average for day1: A1 = (sum of v_i1) / 24 = 2.052\n        and the average of (v_i1 / A1) for i=0..23 is (sum of v_i1) / (24 * A1) = (24 * A1) / (24 * A1) = 1.0.\n\n        Similarly for each day, the average of the normalized values by that day's average is 1.0.\n\n        Therefore, the average of the raw indices (S_i) over 24 hours is the average of 1.0 (from each day) divided by 4? Actually, the average of the 24 S_i is:\n\n            (1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0) / 4 = 1.0.\n\n        Why? Because for each day j, the average of (v_ij / A_j) over i is 1.0. Then the average of the 24 S_i is the average_{i} [ (v_i1/A1 + v_i2/A2 + v_i3/A3 + v_i4/A4)/4 ] \n            = (1/4) * [ (average_i v_i1/A1) + (average_i v_i2/A2) + ... ]\n            = (1/4) * [1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0] = 1.0.\n\n        So we don't need to normalize.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the raw indices.\n\n   Now, we compute the index for each hour:\n\n        Hour0: (1.401/2.052 + 3.929/2.748 + 1.249/2.489 + 4.051/2.836) / 4\n            = (0.6825 + 1.4300 + 0.5018 + 1.4283) / 4 = 4.0426 / 4 = 1.01065\n\n        Hour1: (1.279/2.052 + 3.746/2.748 + 1.249/2.489 + 3.777/2.836) / 4\n            = (0.6232 + 1.3630 + 0.5018 + 1.3318) / 4 = (0.6232+1.3630=1.9862; +0.5018=2.488; +1.3318=3.8198) -> 3.8198/4 = 0.95495\n\n        Hour2: (1.127/2.052 + 3.716/2.748 + 1.097/2.489 + 3.655/2.836) / 4\n            = (0.5491 + 1.3522 + 0.4408 + 1.2889) / 4 = (0.5491+1.3522=1.9013; +0.4408=2.3421; +1.2889=3.631) -> 3.631/4 = 0.90775\n\n        Hour3: (1.066/2.052 + 3.746/2.748 + 1.127/2.489 + 3.929/2.836) / 4\n            = (0.5193 + 1.3630 + 0.4529 + 1.3855) / 4 = (0.5193+1.3630=1.8823; +0.4529=2.3352; +1.3855=3.7207) -> 3.7207/4 = 0.930175\n\n        Hour4: (1.157/2.052 + 3.746/2.748 + 1.157/2.489 + 3.929/2.836) / 4\n            = (0.5637 + 1.3630 + 0.4649 + 1.3855) / 4 = (0.5637+1.3630=1.9267; +0.4649=2.3916; +1.3855=3.7771) -> 3.94425/4 = 0.944275\n\n        Actually, I see that this is very time-consuming. We have 24 hours and 4 days, so 96 data points. We need a better way.\n\n   Since we are an expert and we are to provide the forecast, we can use a program. But the problem is we are in a text environment.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different model: the naive seasonal model that uses the last available cycle. Since we are to forecast the next day, we can use the same as the last day (2016-11-13) for the next day? But then we need 4 days.\n\n   We can use the last day (2016-11-13) repeated 4 times? \n\n   But the pattern on 2016-11-13 might be different from the previous days? And we have 4 days of history.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the last two days? \n\n   However, the problem requires 96 points. We must provide 96 points.\n\n   Given the time constraint, I propose to use the last day (2016-11-13) as the forecast for the next day (2016-11-14), then use the average of the last two days for the next three days? \n\n   But that might not be accurate.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n   Without more information, we can use a simple average of the 4 days for each hour? \n\n   For hour0: (1.401 + 3.929 + 1.249 + 4.051) / 4 = (1.401+3.929=5.33; +1.249=6.579; +4.051=10.63) -> 10.63/4 = 2.6575\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, for hour0, we use 2.6575? But then the daily pattern might be lost.\n\n   This is not using the daily average adjustment.\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, I will choose to use the seasonal index method as described above, and I will compute the indices for all 24 hours.\n\n   We'll do it systematically:\n\n        Let A = [2.0521666666666667, 2.7476666666666666, 2.4887916666666667, 2.836375]\n\n        Let V be the 4x24 matrix of values.\n\n        We compute for each hour i (0 to 23):\n            S_i = ( V[0][i]/A[0] + V[1][i]/A[1] + V[2][i]/A[2] + V[3][i]/A[3] ) / 4\n\n        Then forecast for that hour = S_i * 2.53125\n\n   We'll do it for the first few and then extrapolate the pattern? But we have to do all.\n\n   I'll do it in a table:\n\n        Hour0: \n            V0: 1.401 -> 1.401/2.0521667 = 0.6825\n            V1: 3.929 -> 3.929/2.7476667 = 1.4300\n            V2: 1.249 -> 1.249/2.4887917 = 0.5018\n            V3: 4.051 -> 4.051/2.836375 = 1.4283\n            S0 = (0.6825+1.4300+0.5018+1.4283)/4 = 4.0426/4 = 1.01065\n            Forecast0 = 1.01065 * 2.53125 = 2.558 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n        Hour1:\n            V0: 1.279 -> 1.279/2.0521667 = 0.6232\n            V1: 3.746 -> 3.746/2.7476667 = 1.3630\n            V2: 1.249 -> 1.249/2.4887917 = 0.5018\n            V3: 3.777 -> 3.777/2.836375 = 1.3318\n            S1 = (0.6232+1.3630+0.5018+1.3318)/4 = 3.8198/4 = 0.95495\n            Forecast1 = 0.95495 * 2.53125 = 2.417 (rounded)\n\n        Hour2:\n            V0: 1.127 -> 1.127/2.0521667 = 0.5491\n            V1: 3.716 -> 3.716/2.7476667 = 1.3522\n            V2: 1.097 -> 1.097/2.4887917 = 0.4408\n            V3: 3.655 -> 3.655/2.836375 = 1.2889\n            S2 = (0.5491+1.3522+0.4408+1.2889)/4 = 3.631/4 = 0.90775\n            Forecast2 = 0.90775 * 2.53125 = 2.298\n\n        Hour3:\n            V0: 1.066 -> 1.066/2.0521667 = 0.5193\n            V1: 3.746 -> 3.746/2.7476667 = 1.3630\n            V2: 1.127 -> 1.127/2.4887917 = 0.4529\n            V3: 3.929 -> 3.929/2.836375 = 1.3855\n            S3 = (0.5193+1.3630+0.4529+1.3855)/4 = 3.7207/4 = 0.930175\n            Forecast3 = 0.930175 * 2.53125 = 2.355\n\n        Hour4:\n            V0: 1.157 -> 1.157/2.0521667 = 0.5637\n            V1: 3.746 -> 3.746/2.7476667 = 1.3630\n            V2: 1.157 -> 1.157/2.4887917 = 0.4649\n            V3: 3.929 -> 3.929/2.836375 = 1.3855\n            S4 = (0.5637+1.3630+0.4649+1.3855)/4 = 3.7771/4 = 0.944275\n            Forecast4 = 0.944275 * 2.53125 = 2.390\n\n        Hour5:\n            V0: 1.432 -> 1.432/2.0521667 = 0.6977\n            V1: 4.051 -> 4.051/2.7476667 = 1.4740\n            V2: 4.325 -> 4.325/2.4887917 = 1.7377\n            V3: 3.929 -> 3.929/2.836375 = 1.3855\n            S5 = (0.6977+1.4740+1.7377+1.3855)/4 = 5.2949/4 = 1.323725\n            Forecast5 = 1.323725 * 2.53125 = 3.351\n\n        Hour6:\n            V0: 1.980 -> 1.980/2.0521667 = 0.9646\n            V1: 4.386 -> 4.386/2.7476667 = 1.5960\n            V2: 4.386 -> 4.386/2.4887917 = 1.7622\n            V3: 4.386 -> 4.386/2.836375 = 1.5466\n            Actually, V3 for hour6 is 4.386?

We round to 3 decimals.\n\n   But let me check: the input has up to 3 decimals, so we output 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n   This is a simple and reasonable forecast given the data.\n\n   We are aware that there might be missing values in the future, but for this forecast we are not given any, so we assume the pattern holds.\n\n   Let's write the full 96 points.\n",
