        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00 (4 days * 24 hours = 96 records).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to capture potential daily seasonality (24-hour cycle), we can use a model that handles seasonality.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data is relatively short (only 96 points), we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, without extensive history, complex models might be hard to tune.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple method such as:\n    - Using the last known value (naive forecast) but that won't capture seasonality.\n    - Using a moving average.\n\n 5. Given the data shows some fluctuations and potential daily pattern (though only 4 days), we can try to compute the average for each hour of the day and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    How?\n    - We have 4 days of data. We can group by hour (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the average of the 4 values for each hour.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the averaged hourly pattern for 4 days.\n\n 6. Let's check if the data has a daily pattern:\n\n    For example, look at hour 00:00:\n        2016-07-05 00:00:00 -> 11.989\n        2016-07-06 00:00:00 -> 10.382\n        2016-07-07 00:00:00 -> 12.592\n        2016-07-08 00:00:00 -> 11.855\n\n    Average for 00:00: (11.989 + 10.382 + 12.592 + 11.855) / 4 = 11.7045\n\n    Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n 7. This method is simple and can capture the daily seasonality. Since we are only given 4 days, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 8. Steps for the forecast:\n    a) Group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the date, only by the hour).\n    b) For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n    c) For the next 96 hours (4 days), we will use the computed mean for each hour in order.\n\n 9. However, note that the last provided date is 2016-07-08 23:00:00. The next 96 hours start at 2016-07-09 00:00:00 and end at 2016-07-12 23:00:00.\n\n 10. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 11. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n      Hour 0: (11.989 + 10.382 + 12.592 + 11.855) / 4 = 11.7045\n      Hour 1: (12.525 + 10.717 + 14.200 + 10.382) / 4 = 12.456\n      ... and so on.\n\n 12. But note: the data for 2016-07-08 23:00:00 is 18.152, which is an outlier? However, we are taking the average so it will be included.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the median to be robust to outliers? But the problem does not specify. Since we are only given 4 points per hour, the average is acceptable.\n\n 14. We must be cautious: if there are missing values in the original data, we would have to handle them. But in the provided 96 points, there are none.\n\n 15. Implementation:\n\n     We'll create a list of the 96 given values. Then, we'll group by the hour index (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n     Then, for the next 96 hours, we will cycle through the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 16. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and accumulate the values.\n\n      For hour 0 (00:00): indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n      For hour 1 (01:00): indices 1, 25, 49, 73\n      ... \n\n 17. Then the forecast for:\n        Day 5 (2016-07-09) 00:00:00: use the average of hour0\n        Day 5 (2016-07-09) 01:00:00: use the average of hour1\n        ... until 23:00:00: use the average of hour23\n\n        Then Day 6 (2016-07-10) 00:00:00: again average of hour0\n        ... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 18. We must generate the dates as well.\n\n 19. The last date in the input is 2016-07-08 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-07-09 00:00:00.\n\n 20. We'll generate the next 96 dates by starting from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 and adding 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 21. Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-07-09 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-07-09 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-07-12 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 22. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n      We have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n      We'll create a list of 24 lists, each for an hour.\n\n      Then, for each hour i in 0..23, we take the values[i + 0*24], values[i + 1*24], values[i + 2*24], values[i + 3*24]\n\n 23. The given data:\n\n      Day0: indices 0 to 23\n      Day1: indices 24 to 47\n      Day2: indices 48 to 71\n      Day3: indices 72 to 95\n\n 24. So for hour i (0<=i<=23), the four values are at:\n        i, i+24, i+48, i+72\n\n 25. We'll compute the mean for each i.\n\n 26. Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be 4 cycles of these 24 means.\n\n 27. Code for the computation (pseudocode):\n\n      values = [11.989, 18.152]  # the entire list of 96 values\n\n      hourly_means = []\n      for hour in range(24):\n          total = [values[hour], values[hour+24], values[hour+48], values[hour+72]]\n          mean = sum(total) / 4\n          hourly_means.append(mean)\n\n      Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n          forecast = hourly_means * 4   # because 4 days\n\n 28. But note: the last value in the given data is at index 95 (which is the 96th element). The next 96 hours are independent.\n\n 29. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n      We'll do the calculation for each hour.\n\n 30. However, note that the data might have noise and the average might smooth it. This is a simple and effective method for capturing daily seasonality with limited data.\n\n 31. We'll now compute the hourly means:\n\n      Hour 0: (11.989 + 10.382 + 12.592 + 11.855) / 4 = (11.989+10.382=22.371; 22.371+12.592=34.963; 34.963+11.855=46.818) -> 46.818/4 = 11.7045\n      Hour 1: (12.525 + 10.717 + 14.200 + 10.382) / 4 = (12.525+10.717=23.242; 23.242+14.200=37.442; 37.442+10.382=47.824) -> 47.824/4 = 11.956\n      ... \n\n 32. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 33. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we proceed.\n\n 34. We can write a small program to compute the means, but since we are an AI, we'll do it step by step.\n\n 35. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model? But the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide a forecast.\n\n 36. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, the hourly average is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 37. Let's compute the 24 hourly means:\n\n      We'll list the indices for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [0, 24, 48, 72] -> [11.989, 10.382, 12.592, 11.855] -> mean = (11.989+10.382+12.592+11.855)/4 = 11.7045\n        hour1: [1,25,49,73] -> [12.525, 10.717, 14.200, 10.382] -> (12.525+10.717+14.200+10.382)/4 = 12.824/4? Let me calculate: \n                12.525+10.717 = 23.242; 23.242+14.200=37.442; 37.442+10.382=47.824 -> 47.824/4 = 11.956\n        hour2: [2,26,50,74] -> [12.324, 10.851, 12.592, 11.186] -> (12.324+10.851+12.592+11.186)/4 = (12.324+10.851=23.175; 23.175+12.592=35.767; 35.767+11.186=46.953) -> 46.953/4 = 11.73825\n        hour3: [3,27,51,75] -> [10.717, 9.779, 14.267, 10.248] -> (10.717+9.779=20.496; 20.496+14.267=34.763; 34.763+10.248=45.011) -> 45.011/4 = 11.25275\n        hour4: [4,28,52,76] -> [11.320, 9.377, 12.592, 10.918] -> (11.320+9.377=20.697; 20.697+12.592=33.289; 33.289+10.918=44.207) -> 44.207/4 = 11.05175\n        hour5: [5,29,53,77] -> [10.851, 11.387, 13.731, 12.659] -> (10.851+11.387=22.238; 22.238+13.731=35.969; 35.969+12.659=48.628) -> 48.628/4 = 12.157\n        hour6: [6,30,54,78] -> [13.329, 11.855, 15.137, 13.597] -> (13.329+11.855=25.184; 25.184+15.137=40.321; 40.321+13.597=53.918) -> 53.918/4 = 13.4795\n        hour7: [7,31,55,79] -> [11.454, 12.525, 14.267, 10.382] -> (11.454+12.525=23.979; 23.979+14.267=38.246; 38.246+10.382=48.628) -> 48.628/4 = 12.157\n        hour8: [8,32,56,80] -> [11.052, 12.726, 12.525, 9.980] -> (11.052+12.726=23.778; 23.778+12.525=36.303; 36.303+9.980=46.283) -> 46.283/4 = 11.57075\n        hour9: [9,33,57,81] -> [10.985, 11.119, 12.324, 9.645] -> (10.985+11.119=22.104; 22.104+12.324=34.428; 34.428+9.645=44.073) -> 44.073/4 = 11.01825\n        hour10: [10,34,58,82] -> [12.793, 11.788, 13.262, 11.721] -> (12.793+11.788=24.581; 24.581+13.262=37.843; 37.843+11.721=49.564) -> 49.564/4 = 12.391\n        hour11: [11,35,59,83] -> [13.396, 13.128, 12.324, 11.788] -> (13.396+13.128=26.524; 26.524+12.324=38.848; 38.848+11.788=50.636) -> 50.636/4 = 12.659\n        hour12: [12,36,60,84] -> [11.253, 10.583, 9.645, 10.449] -> (11.253+10.583=21.836; 21.836+9.645=31.481; 31.481+10.449=41.93) -> 41.93/4 = 10.4825\n        hour13: [13,37,61,85] -> [9.913, 10.315, 10.516, 10.181] -> (9.913+10.315=20.228; 20.228+10.516=30.744; 30.744+10.181=40.925) -> 40.925/4 = 10.23125\n        hour14: [14,38,62,86] -> [10.181, 9.444, 9.377, 12.927] -> (10.181+9.444=19.625; 19.625+9.377=29.002; 29.002+12.927=41.929) -> 41.929/4 = 10.48225\n        hour15: [15,39,63,87] -> [10.851, 10.449, 9.109, 10.181] -> (10.851+10.449=21.3; 21.3+9.109=30.409; 30.409+10.181=40.59) -> 40.59/4 = 10.1475\n        hour16: [16,40,64,88] -> [10.047, 9.846, 9.243, 9.444] -> (10.047+9.846=19.893; 19.893+9.243=29.136; 29.136+9.444=38.58) -> 38.58/4 = 9.645\n        hour17: [17,41,65,89] -> [11.922, 10.985, 10.449, 10.315] -> (11.922+10.985=22.907; 22.907+10.449=33.356; 33.356+10.315=43.671) -> 43.671/4 = 10.91775\n        hour18: [18,42,66,90] -> [11.454, 10.717, 11.052, 10.717] -> (11.454+10.717=22.171; 22.171+11.052=33.223; 33.223+10.717=43.94) -> 43.94/4 = 10.985\n        hour19: [19,43,67,91] -> [10.851, 9.176, 10.114, 10.181] -> (10.851+9.176=20.027; 20.027+10.114=30.141; 30.141+10.181=40.322) -> 40.322/4 = 10.0805\n        hour20: [20,44,68,92] -> [11.186, 9.645, 11.119, 11.855] -> (11.186+9.645=20.831; 20.831+11.119=31.95; 31.95+11.855=43.805) -> 43.805/4 = 10.95125\n        hour21: [21,45,69,93] -> [10.650, 8.506, 10.449, 12.726] -> (10.650+8.506=19.156; 19.156+10.449=29.605; 29.605+12.726=42.331) -> 42.331/4 = 10.58275\n        hour22: [22,46,70,94] -> [9.980, 10.516, 10.516, 14.066] -> (9.980+10.516=20.496; 20.496+10.516=31.012; 31.012+14.066=45.078) -> 45.078/4 = 11.2695\n        hour23: [23,47,71,95] -> [11.855, 13.396, 11.855, 18.152] -> (11.855+13.396=25.251; 25.251+11.855=37.106; 37.106+18.152=55.258) -> 55.258/4 = 13.8145\n\n 38.

We must output the data in the same format: two columns: date and HUFL.\n\n 42. We'll write the forecast values with 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 43. However, note: the computed means have more than 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 44. Let's round the hourly means to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 11.705\n        hour1: 11.956\n        hour2: 11.738\n        hour3: 11.253\n        hour4: 11.052\n        hour5: 12.157\n        hour6: 13.480\n        hour7: 12.157\n        hour8: 11.571\n        hour9: 11.018\n        hour10: 12.391\n        hour11: 12.659\n        hour12: 10.483\n        hour13: 10.231\n        hour14: 10.482\n        hour15: 10.148\n        hour16: 9.645\n        hour17: 10.918\n        hour18: 10.985\n        hour19: 10.081\n        hour20: 10.951\n        hour21: 10.583\n        hour22: 11.270\n        hour23: 13.815\n\n 45. Now, we'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n 46. We must be cautious: the rounding might cause slight inaccuracies, but it's acceptable.\n\n 47.

We must ensure the dates are correct.\n\n 50. We'll write the entire output.\n\n 51. Note: The rounding: we did round to 3 decimals. For example, 11.7045 -> 11.705 (because 4 is followed by 5, so round up).\n\n 52. However, let me double-check the rounding for one: 11.7045 -> to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal from 4 to 5 -> 11.705.\n\n 53. Similarly, 11.73825 -> 11.738 (because the 4th decimal is 2, so we don't round up).\n\n 54. But wait: 11.73825: \n        thousandths place: 8, next digit is 2 which is <5, so we leave it -> 11.738.\n\n 55. Correction: we should round to 3 decimal places by standard rounding rule.\n\n 56. Let me recast the rounding:\n\n        hour0: 11.7045 -> 11.705\n        hour1: 11.956 -> 11.956 (exactly, so 11.956)\n        hour2: 11.73825 -> 11.738\n        hour3: 11.25275 -> 11.253 (because 2 in the 4th decimal and then 75, so 11.25275: the 3rd decimal is 2, the next is 7 which is >=5 -> round up 2 to 3 -> 11.253)\n        hour4: 11.05175 -> 11.052\n        hour5: 12.157 -> 12.157\n        hour6: 13.4795 -> 13.480\n        hour7: 12.157 -> 12.157\n        hour8: 11.57075 -> 11.571\n        hour9: 11.01825 -> 11.018\n        because: 11.01825: the 3rd decimal is 8, the next is 2 -> so 11.018? \n        But wait: 11.01825: \n            thousandths: 8, and the next digit is 2 -> so we leave 8 -> 11.018\n        However, note: 11.01825 is 11.018 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n        Actually, 11.01825: \n            The digits: 1 (tens), 1 (units), 0 (tenths), 1 (hundredths), 8 (thousandths), 2 (ten thousandths), 5 (hundred thousandths).\n            We are rounding to thousandths: look at the ten thousandths (2) which is <5 -> so we leave the thousandths as 8 -> 11.018.\n\n        But wait, the input had 3 decimals, so we output 3 decimals. However, 11.018 is 3 decimals? It is.\n\n        hour10: 12.391 -> 12.391\n        hour11: 12.659 -> 12.659\n        hour12: 10.4825 -> 10.483 (because 10.4825: the 3rd decimal is 2, the next is 5 -> round up to 3 -> 10.483)\n        hour13: 10.23125 -> 10.231 (because 2 in the 4th decimal is 2 -> leave)\n        hour14: 10.48225 -> 10.482\n        hour15: 10.1475 -> 10.148 (because 7 in the 3rd decimal, then 5 -> round up 7 to 8 -> 10.148)\n        hour16: 9.645 -> 9.645\n        hour17: 10.91775 -> 10.918\n        hour18: 10.985 -> 10.985\n        hour19: 10.0805 -> 10.081\n        hour20: 10.95125 -> 10.951\n        because: 10.95125: the 3rd decimal is 1, the next is 2 -> leave -> 10.951)\n        hour21: 10.58275 -> 10.583\n        hour22: 11.2695 -> 11.270\n        hour23: 13.8145 -> 13.815\n\n 57. So corrected:\n\n        hour0: 11.705\n        hour1: 11.956\n        hour2: 11.738\n        hour3: 11.253\n        hour4: 11.052\n        hour5: 12.157\n        hour6: 13.480\n        hour7: 12.157\n        hour8: 11.571\n        hour9: 11.018\n        hour10: 12.391\n        hour11: 12.659\n        hour12: 10.483\n        hour13: 10.231\n        hour14: 10.482\n        hour15: 10.148\n        hour16: 9.645\n        hour17: 10.918\n        hour18: 10.985\n        hour19: 10.081\n        hour20: 10.951\n        hour21: 10.583\n        hour22: 11.270\n        hour23: 13.815\n\n 58.
