        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the HULL (High UseLess Load) from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values.\n    However, the provided data for the past 96 is complete. For forecasting, we must handle the possibility of missing values in the input, but here we have complete data.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are dealing with hourly data and we expect daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) which can handle seasonality.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can also capture seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows a lot of fluctuations and negative values. We must ensure the model can handle such data.\n\n 5. We'll use the following approach:\n    a. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    b. If non-stationary, we may need to difference the series (both regular and seasonal differences).\n    c. Fit a SARIMA model.\n\n 6. But note: we are not allowed to output code or the process, only the forecasted data.\n\n 7. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, we must generate the timestamps and the forecasted HULL values.\n\n 8. We'll use the last date in the data: 2017-02-21 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n 9. We must be cautious: the data might have multiple seasonality? But with only 4 days of data, we can only capture daily seasonality (24 periods).\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without showing the code, we will use a standard approach.\n\n 11. We'll use an automated method to select the best SARIMA parameters (using auto_arima from pmdarima) or use a simple model if we cannot run code.\n\n However, note: as an AI, I can simulate the process.\n\n But the problem: I cannot run code in the traditional sense. Therefore, I will describe the steps and then provide a forecast based on patterns.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n Let me look at the data:\n\n  The data for each day (from 00:00 to 23:00) for 4 days:\n\n  Day 1 (2017-02-18): \n    00:00: 1.273, 01:00: 1.741, ... 23:00: 1.608\n\n  Day 2 (2017-02-19): \n    00:00: 0.938, ... 23:00: 0.804\n\n  Day 3 (2017-02-20): \n    00:00: 1.541, ... 23:00: 0.603\n\n  Day 4 (2017-02-21): \n    00:00: 0.871, ... 23:00: 0.067\n\n  We can see that the pattern is not very consistent. \n\n  Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n    Forecast for the next day (2017-02-22) is the same as the previous day (2017-02-21) but adjusted by the average change from the previous days?\n\n  However, a more robust way is to use a model. Since I cannot run code, I will use a simulated forecast using a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n  Steps for the forecast:\n\n    For hour h (where h from 0 to 23) in the next 4 days (which are 4 days: 2017-02-22 to 2017-02-25), we do:\n\n        forecast_hour_h = average of the same hour h from the past 4 days.\n\n    But note: we have exactly 4 days of history.\n\n    Example for hour 00:00:\n        Day1: 1.273\n        Day2: 0.938\n        Day3: 1.541\n        Day4: 0.871\n        Average = (1.273 + 0.938 + 1.541 + 0.871) / 4 = 1.15575\n\n    Then for 2017-02-22 00:00:00 -> 1.156 (rounded to 3 decimals as in the data)\n\n    Similarly, for hour 01:00:\n        Day1: 1.741\n        Day2: 1.072\n        Day3: 0.871\n        Day4: 0.670\n        Average = (1.741+1.072+0.871+0.670)/4 = 4.354/4 = 1.0885 -> 1.089\n\n    But note: the data has negative values and fluctuations. This method might smooth out the pattern.\n\n 12. However, this method does not account for any trend. We see that the last day (2017-02-21) has a decreasing trend? \n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing for each hour? But without code, we have to do it manually for 24 hours and then repeat for 4 days? \n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 15. We decide to use the average method for simplicity and because we have limited history.\n\n 16. However, we have 4 days and we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same pattern of the last day (2017-02-21) for the next day? But that would be naive.\n\n 17. Considering the requirement and the fact that we must provide 96 points, we will compute the forecast for each hour of the day by averaging the 4 available days for that hour.\n\n 18. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will repeat the same averaged daily pattern.\n\n 19. Steps:\n\n      a. For each hour in 0 to 23:\n            avg_h = (value_h from day1 + value_h from day2 + value_h from day3 + value_h from day4) / 4\n\n      b. Then the forecast for day5 (2017-02-22) will be [avg_0, avg_1, ... avg_23]\n         day6 (2017-02-23) will be the same pattern: [avg_0, avg_1, ... avg_23]\n         day7 (2017-02-24) and day8 (2017-02-25) the same.\n\n 20. But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data (only 4 days). Also, the next 4 days are consecutive and include a weekend? \n     The given data starts on a Saturday (2017-02-18) and ends on Tuesday (2017-02-21). The next 4 days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n     However, we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality. So we ignore.\n\n 21. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.273 + 0.938 + 1.541 + 0.871) / 4 = (4.623) / 4 = 1.15575 -> 1.156\n        hour1: (1.741 + 1.072 + 0.871 + 0.670) / 4 = (4.354) / 4 = 1.0885 -> 1.089\n        hour2: (1.741 + 1.139 + 1.875 + 0.000) / 4 = (4.755) / 4 = 1.18875 -> 1.189\n        hour3: (1.206 + 0.536 + -0.402 + 0.536) / 4 = (1.876) / 4 = 0.469\n        hour4: (1.139 + 1.206 + -0.067 + 0.938) / 4 = (3.216) / 4 = 0.804\n        hour5: (1.808 + 0.469 + 0.000 + 0.804) / 4 = (3.081) / 4 = 0.77025 -> 0.770\n        hour6: (1.139 + 0.670 + 0.000 + 0.067) / 4 = (1.876) / 4 = 0.469\n        hour7: (0.737 + 0.268 + 0.000 + 0.670) / 4 = (1.675) / 4 = 0.41875 -> 0.419\n        hour8: (0.670 + 1.072 + -0.469 + 1.407) / 4 = (2.680) / 4 = 0.670\n        hour9: (0.670 + -0.469 + -1.407 + 0.938) / 4 = (-0.268) / 4 = -0.067\n        hour10: (0.469 + 0.000 + 0.000 + 0.067) / 4 = (0.536) / 4 = 0.134\n        hour11: (1.674 + 1.340 + 0.067 + 0.000) / 4 = (3.081) / 4 = 0.77025 -> 0.770\n        hour12: (0.402 + 0.335 + -0.670 + 0.402) / 4 = (0.469) / 4 = 0.11725 -> 0.117\n        hour13: (1.139 + 2.143 + 0.134 + 0.335) / 4 = (3.751) / 4 = 0.93775 -> 0.938\n        hour14: (0.737 + 0.134 + 0.335 + 0.134) / 4 = (1.340) / 4 = 0.335\n        hour15: (0.938 + 0.201 + 0.134 + -0.067) / 4 = (1.206) / 4 = 0.3015 -> 0.302\n        hour16: (-0.134 + -0.603 + 0.000 + -1.072) / 4 = (-1.809) / 4 = -0.45225 -> -0.452\n        hour17: (-0.402 + -0.670 + -0.268 + -1.072) / 4 = (-2.412) / 4 = -0.603\n        hour18: (-0.603 + -1.139 + -0.670 + -1.942) / 4 = (-4.354) / 4 = -1.0885 -> -1.089\n        hour19: (-0.871 + -1.072 + -0.871 + -1.340) / 4 = (-4.154) / 4 = -1.0385 -> -1.039\n        hour20: (-0.871 + -1.608 + -0.737 + -1.674) / 4 = (-4.890) / 4 = -1.2225 -> -1.223\n        hour21: (-2.344 + -0.804 + -1.541 + -2.947) / 4 = (-7.636) / 4 = -1.909\n        hour22: (0.000 + 0.469 + -0.670 + -0.737) / 4 = (-0.938) / 4 = -0.2345 -> -0.235\n        hour23: (1.608 + 0.804 + 0.603 + 0.067) / 4 = (3.082) / 4 = 0.7705 -> 0.771\n\n 22. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-22 23:00:00: [1.156, 1.089, 0.469, ... , 0.771] (the 24 values above)\n        Day 2: 2017-02-23: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2017-02-24: same\n        Day 4: 2017-02-25: same\n\n 23. But note: the data might have a trend? We are not accounting for that. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n 24. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 25. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. Let's write the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-22 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-22 01:00:00, ... until 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We generate the next 96 timestamps and assign the corresponding average value for that hour.\n\n 28. The list of averages by hour (0 to 23) is:\n\n        hour0: 1.156\n        hour1: 1.089\n        hour2: 1.189\n        hour3: 0.469\n        hour4: 0.804\n        hour5: 0.770\n        hour6: 0.469\n        hour7: 0.419\n        hour8: 0.670\n        hour9: -0.067\n        hour10: 0.134\n        hour11: 0.770\n        hour12: 0.117\n        hour13: 0.938\n        hour14: 0.335\n        hour15: 0.302\n        hour16: -0.452\n        hour17: -0.603\n        hour18: -1.089\n        hour19: -1.039\n        hour20: -1.223\n        hour21: -1.909\n        hour22: -0.235\n        hour23: 0.771\n\n 29. Then for each day in the next 4 days, we assign these 24 values.\n\n 30. We write the data in the format:\n\n        date, HULL\n        2017-02-22 00:00:00, 1.156\n        2017-02-22 01:00:00, 1.089\n        ... \n        2017-02-22 23:00:00, 0.771\n        2017-02-23 00:00:00, 1.156\n        ... until 2017-02-25 23:00:00\n\n 31. We output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 32. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are forecasting without missing values.\n\n 33. We output the data in the required XML-like format.\n\n 34. Let's generate the string.\n\n 35. We note: the original data has negative values and we have negative values in the forecast.\n\n 36.
