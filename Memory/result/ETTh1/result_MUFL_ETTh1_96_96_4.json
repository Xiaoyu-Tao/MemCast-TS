        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete.\n    However, we are to forecast the next 96 and must be aware that the provided data might have had missing values? But in this case, we have 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is 4 days), we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 forecasted values, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Seasonality: There appears to be daily patterns (24-hour cycle).\n    - Trend: We can check for any trend in the 4 days provided.\n\n 4. We are limited by the fact that we only have 96 points (4 days) for training. This is a very short history.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, or Exponential Smoothing, or even a small ARIMA model with seasonality.\n\n    However, note: the data shows a clear daily pattern (24 hours). Let's check the pattern by day:\n\n        Day 1 (07-17): min around 5.0, max around 11.655\n        Day 2 (07-18): min around 5.0, max around 11.371\n        Day 3 (07-19): min around 4.904, max around 11.371\n        Day 4 (07-20): min around 5.579, max around 11.194\n\n    The pattern is not exactly the same every day, but there are similarities.\n\n 6. Given the short history, we can use a seasonal naive method: using the last available day (day 4: 2016-07-20) as the forecast for the next day?\n    But note: the last day (07-20) has a pattern that is somewhat different from the previous days.\n\n    Alternatively, we can take the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But that would smooth out the pattern.\n\n 7. Another idea: use an average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day? That is, for hour 00:00, we have 4 values: \n        [2016-07-17 00:00:00  8.599,\n         2016-07-18 00:00:00 10.163,\n         2016-07-19 00:00:00 11.371,\n         2016-07-20 00:00:00  8.209]\n    Then the forecast for 2016-07-21 00:00:00 would be the average of these: (8.599+10.163+11.371+8.209)/4 = 9.5855.\n\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n 8. However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        We can compute:\n\n        Day1: average = (8.599+8.173+...+11.655)/24 -> let's not compute by hand, but we can note that the values are around 5 to 12.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a moving average to capture the level and then adjust by the seasonal pattern.\n\n 9. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h of day d (where d is the next day) = average of the same hour h of the previous 4 days.\n\n    But note: we have exactly 4 days of data.\n\n 10. However, we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) ahead. So we can do:\n\n        For the first 24 hours (2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-21 23:00:00): \n            hour 00:00: average of 00:00 of 2016-07-17, 2016-07-18, 2016-07-19, 2016-07-20\n            hour 01:00: average of 01:00 of the same 4 days\n            ... and so on.\n\n        Then for the next day (2016-07-22) we can use the same pattern? But we don't have more days. So we can use the same pattern again? \n        That is, for 2016-07-22 00:00:00, we use the same average as for 2016-07-21 00:00:00? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"forecast the next 96 recorded dates\", which is 96 hours (4 days). So we can use the same daily pattern for each of the 4 days.\n\n        However, that would be too simplistic and would ignore any trend. But we don't have a long history to capture a weekly trend or a monthly trend.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-07-20) as the base and then adjust by the average of the daily patterns? \n\n 12. Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n        We compute the average for each hour of the day (over the 4 days) and then use that as the pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        So the forecast for:\n          2016-07-21 00:00:00 = average of the 4 days at 00:00\n          2016-07-21 01:00:00 = average of the 4 days at 01:00\n          ... \n          and then for 2016-07-22 00:00:00, we use the same average at 00:00 as above.\n\n        This method is called the \"seasonal naive\" with a period of 24 and using the average of the last 4 seasons.\n\n 13. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We have 4 days, 24 hours per day -> 4 values per hour.\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n            Day1 (2016-07-21): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n            Day2 (2016-07-22): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n            Day3 (2016-07-23): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n            Day4 (2016-07-24): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n 14. How to compute the average for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n\n        Day1: 8.599\n        Day2: 10.163\n        Day3: 11.371\n        Day4: 8.209\n        Average = (8.599 + 10.163 + 11.371 + 8.209) / 4 = 9.342   (rounded to 3 decimals as in the input)\n\n        Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n\n        Day1: 8.173\n        Day2: 11.371\n        Day3: 11.300\n        Day4: 8.848\n        Average = (8.173 + 11.371 + 11.300 + 8.848) / 4 = 9.923\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 15. We must be cautious: the data had missing values? But the provided 96 points are complete. So we can proceed.\n\n 16. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern 4 times.\n\n 17. Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to write the output.\n\n    We'll create a list of the 4 days for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [8.599, 10.163, 11.371, 8.209] -> 9.5855 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 9.586? \n        But note: the input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Actually, let's compute:\n\n        8.599 + 10.163 = 18.762\n        18.762 + 11.371 = 30.133\n        30.133 + 8.209 = 38.342\n        38.342 / 4 = 9.5855 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 9.586? But note: the input sometimes has 3 decimals, but we see 8.599 has 3, 10.163 has 3, etc.\n\n        However, the example output in the data has 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Similarly for hour1: \n          8.173 + 11.371 = 19.544\n          19.544 + 11.300 = 30.844\n          30.844 + 8.848 = 39.692\n          39.692 / 4 = 9.923\n\n        hour2: \n          7.747 (day1), 10.092 (day2), 10.838 (day3), 7.960 (day4) \n          = (7.747+10.092+10.838+7.960)/4 = 36.637/4 = 9.15925 -> 9.159\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 18. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 19. Then we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start at 2016-07-21 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-07-20 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-07-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        The last date in the input is 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n        Then:\n          2016-07-21 00:00:00\n          2016-07-21 01:00:00\n          ...\n          2016-07-21 23:00:00 -> day1 of forecast\n          2016-07-22 00:00:00 -> same hour0, so same average for hour0\n          ... until 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n\n 21. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 22. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0:  (8.599 + 10.163 + 11.371 + 8.209) / 4 = 38.342 / 4 = 9.5855 -> 9.586\n1:  (8.173 + 11.371 + 11.300 + 8.848) / 4 = 39.692 / 4 = 9.923\n2:  (7.747 + 10.092 + 10.838 + 7.960) / 4 = 36.637 / 4 = 9.15925 -> 9.159\n3:  (6.787 + 9.594 + 9.594 + 7.214) / 4 = 33.189 / 4 = 8.29725 -> 8.297\n4:  (7.604 + 7.924 + 10.554 + 7.000) / 4 = 33.082 / 4 = 8.2705 -> 8.271\n5:  (7.569 + 8.244 + 10.234 + 7.178) / 4 = 33.225 / 4 = 8.30625 -> 8.306\n6:  (8.884 + 8.635 + 8.777 + 8.031) / 4 = 34.327 / 4 = 8.58175 -> 8.582\n7:  (5.686 + 8.635 + 6.148 + 6.219) / 4 = 26.688 / 4 = 6.672\n8:  (5.650 + 7.711 + 5.579 + 5.792) / 4 = 24.732 / 4 = 6.183\n9:  (5.366 + 6.112 + 6.894 + 6.254) / 4 = 24.626 / 4 = 6.1565 -> 6.157\n10: (6.432 + 6.432 + 6.752 + 7.071) / 4 = 26.687 / 4 = 6.67175 -> 6.672\n11: (6.610 + 6.432 + 6.183 + 6.894) / 4 = 26.119 / 4 = 6.52975 -> 6.530\n12: (5.188 + 5.046 + 4.904 + 5.650) / 4 = 20.788 / 4 = 5.197\n13: (5.010 + 5.686 + 5.224 + 5.970) / 4 = 21.89 / 4 = 5.4725 -> 5.473\n14: (6.148 + 6.432 + 5.792 + 6.716) / 4 = 25.088 / 4 = 6.272\n15: (5.899 + 5.437 + 6.894 + 6.396) / 4 = 24.626 / 4 = 6.1565 -> 6.157\n16: (5.472 + 5.579 + 5.508 + 5.792) / 4 = 22.351 / 4 = 5.58775 -> 5.588\n17: (5.792 + 5.472 + 5.472 + 5.899) / 4 = 22.635 / 4 = 5.65875 -> 5.659\n18: (5.543 + 5.543 + 4.975 + 5.721) / 4 = 21.782 / 4 = 5.4455 -> 5.446\n19: (5.366 + 5.330 + 5.082 + 5.579) / 4 = 21.357 / 4 = 5.33925 -> 5.339\n20: (6.396 + 6.823 + 6.361 + 7.498) / 4 = 27.078 / 4 = 6.7695 -> 6.770\n21: (6.503 + 8.066 + 6.183 + 7.924) / 4 = 28.676 / 4 = 7.169\n22: (9.808 + 9.950 + 5.934 + 11.194) / 4 = 36.886 / 4 = 9.2215 -> 9.222\n23: (11.655 + 10.056 + 8.066 + 10.909) / 4 = 40.686 / 4 = 10.1715 -> 10.172\n\n 23. Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-07-21): \n            00:00:00 -> 9.586\n            01:00:00 -> 9.923\n            02:00:00 -> 9.159\n            03:00:00 -> 8.297\n            04:00:00 -> 8.271\n            05:00:00 -> 8.306\n            06:00:00 -> 8.582\n            07:00:00 -> 6.672\n            08:00:00 -> 6.183\n            09:00:00 -> 6.157\n            10:00:00 -> 6.672\n            11:00:00 -> 6.530\n            12:00:00 -> 5.197\n            13:00:00 -> 5.473\n            14:00:00 -> 6.272\n            15:00:00 -> 6.157\n            16:00:00 -> 5.588\n            17:00:00 -> 5.659\n            18:00:00 -> 5.446\n            19:00:00 -> 5.339\n            20:00:00 -> 6.770\n            21:00:00 -> 7.169\n            22:00:00 -> 9.222\n            23:00:00 -> 10.172\n\n        Day2 (2016-07-22): same values as above for each hour.\n\n        Day3 (2016-07-23): same.\n\n        Day4 (2016-07-24): same.\n\n 24.
