        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records for the HUFL (High Useful Load) from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided sample, there are no missing entries for the given 96 hours. So, we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations). We might consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 4. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, we must generate 96 forecasts.\n\n 5. We can use a time series model. Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. However, we have only 96 points (4 days) to forecast 96 points (4 days). This is a very short history for a seasonal model with daily seasonality (24 periods). But note: the data provided is only 4 days, so we have exactly 4 seasonal cycles? Actually, we have 4 days of hourly data, so 96 points. We are to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 6. We can use a simple seasonal naive model, but that would just repeat the last day? However, the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components. But with only 4 days, it's challenging to fit a seasonal model.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? That is, for hour 00:00, we take the average of the 00:00 of the 4 days we have, and so on for each hour.\n\n However, note the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (2017-10-07) and the previous days: \n  2017-10-07: values are generally higher? But then again, we have only 4 days.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we must choose a method that can be implemented quickly.\n\n 10. We can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, which is a lot. We might break it down by using a model that can capture seasonality.\n\n 11. We'll use a simple method: \n     - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n     - Extrapolate the trend (if any) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n However, with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-10-07) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 13. Since the problem is complex and we are limited by the data, we can use a naive seasonal forecast: \n     - For each hour in the next day, we take the value from the same hour in the previous day (i.e., 24 hours before). But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n\n 14. Let's try: \n     We have 4 days: day0: 2017-10-04, day1: 2017-10-05, day2: 2017-10-06, day3: 2017-10-07.\n\n     For hour 00:00: \n        day0: 9.645, day1: 3.818, day2: 8.439, day3: 7.569 -> average = (9.645+3.818+8.439+7.569)/4 = 7.36775\n\n     Then for the next 00:00 (2017-10-08 00:00:00) we can use 7.36775? \n\n     But note: the last day (2017-10-07) had 7.569 at 00:00, which is above the average? \n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most recent day has more weight? \n\n 16. We can use an exponential smoothing for the seasonal indices.\n\n 17. However, to keep it simple and given the constraints, we will use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days.\n\n 18. Steps for the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00:\n\n     For each hour (0 to 23) in the day, we compute:\n     forecast = (value from 2017-10-04 at that hour + value from 2017-10-05 at that hour + value from 2017-10-06 at that hour + value from 2017-10-07 at that hour) / 4\n\n 19. Then we repeat the same set of 24 hours for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough to capture a long-term trend, but we ignore the trend for now.\n\n 21. Let's generate the forecast:\n\n     We'll create a list for the next 96 hours.\n\n     The first forecasted day: 2017-10-08 (day 4 in the future) \n        hour0: average of [2017-10-04 00:00, 2017-10-05 00:00, 2017-10-06 00:00, 2017-10-07 00:00] = (9.645+3.818+8.439+7.569)/4 = 7.36775\n        hour1: average of [2017-10-04 01:00, ...] = (8.573+3.885+7.435+7.167)/4 = (8.573+3.885+7.435+7.167)/4 = 6.765\n\n     and so on.\n\n 22. Then for 2017-10-09, we use the same set of averages? Because we are repeating the same daily pattern.\n\n 23. So the next 4 days will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 24. However, we must note that the data might have is not exactly stationary. But without more history, this is a simple approach.\n\n 25. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n 26. But note: the provided data has 96 points, which are exactly 4 days (24*4=96). So we can reshape the HUFL data into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the rows (axis=0).\n\n 27. Steps in code (if we were coding) but we are to write the output.\n\n 28. We'll compute the 24 averages:\n\n     hour0: (9.645 + 3.818 + 8.439 + 7.569) / 4 = 7.36775\n     hour1: (8.573 + 3.885 + 7.435 + 7.167) / 4 = (8.573+3.885=12.458; 12.458+7.435=19.893; 19.893+7.167=27.06; 27.06/4=6.765)\n     hour2: (8.573 + 4.019 + 6.095 + 7.033) / 4 = (8.573+4.019=12.592; 12.592+6.095=18.687; 18.687+7.033=25.72; 25.72/4=6.43)\n     hour3: (8.707 + 4.086 + 6.966 + 6.899) / 4 = (8.707+4.086=12.793; 12.793+6.966=19.759; 19.759+6.899=26.658; 26.658/4=6.6645)\n     hour4: (8.239 + 4.153 + 7.435 + 7.837) / 4 = (8.239+4.153=12.392; 12.392+7.435=19.827; 19.827+7.837=27.664; 27.664/4=6.916)\n     hour5: (9.109+4.488+7.033+6.229)/4 = (9.109+4.488=13.597; 13.597+7.033=20.63; 20.63+6.229=26.859; 26.859/4=6.71475)\n     hour6: (9.109+5.760+9.109+8.908)/4 = (9.109+5.760=14.869; 14.869+9.109=23.978; 23.978+8.908=32.886; 32.886/4=8.2215)\n     hour7: (9.712+7.569+9.779+7.502)/4 = (9.712+7.569=17.281; 17.281+9.779=27.06; 27.06+7.502=34.562; 34.562/4=8.6405)\n     hour8: (4.689+6.899+6.497-0.268)/4 = (4.689+6.899=11.588; 11.588+6.497=18.085; 18.085-0.268=17.817; 17.817/4=4.45425)\n     hour9: (2.545+6.631+4.488-8.640)/4 = (2.545+6.631=9.176; 9.176+4.488=13.664; 13.664-8.640=5.024; 5.024/4=1.256)\n     hour10: (-4.488+5.760-5.157-11.721)/4 = (-4.488+5.760=1.272; 1.272-5.157=-3.885; -3.885-11.721=-15.606; -15.606/4=-3.9015)\n     hour11: (-0.402+7.033+3.416-13.128)/4 = (-0.402+7.033=6.631; 6.631+3.416=10.047; 10.047-13.128=-3.081; -3.081/4=-0.77025)\n     hour12: (-6.765+4.354-5.894-16.678)/4 = (-6.765+4.354=-2.411; -2.411-5.894=-8.305; -8.305-16.678=-24.983; -24.983/4=-6.24575)\n     hour13: (-0.603+5.023-4.354-14.669)/4 = (-0.603+5.023=4.42; 4.42-4.354=0.066; 0.066-14.669=-14.603; -14.603/4=-3.65075)\n     hour14: (-0.469+1.808+1.206-12.458)/4 = (-0.469+1.808=1.339; 1.339+1.206=2.545; 2.545-12.458=-9.913; -9.913/4=-2.47825)\n     hour15: (0.938+4.086-1.139-7.770)/4 = (0.938+4.086=5.024; 5.024-1.139=3.885; 3.885-7.770=-3.885; -3.885/4=-0.97125)\n     hour16: (3.215+4.421+2.277-2.612)/4 = (3.215+4.421=7.636; 7.636+2.277=9.913; 9.913-2.612=7.301; 7.301/4=1.82525)\n     hour17: (6.698+6.966+7.234+5.157)/4 = (6.698+6.966=13.664; 13.664+7.234=20.898; 20.898+5.157=26.055; 26.055/4=6.51375)\n     hour18: (6.497+6.564+6.899+6.899)/4 = (6.497+6.564=13.061; 13.061+6.899=19.96; 19.96+6.899=26.859; 26.859/4=6.71475)\n     hour19: (6.698+6.631+7.904+7.770)/4 = (6.698+6.631=13.329; 13.329+7.904=21.233; 21.233+7.770=29.003; 29.003/4=7.25075)\n     hour20: (6.229+6.095+7.033+7.033)/4 = (6.229+6.095=12.324; 12.324+7.033=19.357; 19.357+7.033=26.39; 26.39/4=6.5975)\n     hour21: (5.358+6.497+6.296+8.372)/4 = (5.358+6.497=11.855; 11.855+6.296=18.151; 18.151+8.372=26.523; 26.523/4=6.63075)\n     hour22: (5.291+7.770+7.837+8.908)/4 = (5.291+7.770=13.061; 13.061+7.837=20.898; 20.898+8.908=29.806; 29.806/4=7.4515)\n     hour23: (4.957+8.506+7.502+11.655)/4 = (4.957+8.506=13.463; 13.463+7.502=20.965; 20.965+11.655=32.62; 32.62/4=8.155)\n\n 29.

Write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-08 00:00:00   7.368\n2017-10-08 01:00:00   6.765\n... \n2017-10-11 23:00:00   8.155\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 40. We generate 96 lines.\n\n 41. Note: The dates must be in increasing order.\n\n 42. We'll write the dates for the next 96 hours.\n\n 43. Code for generating the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-10-08 00:00:00\n     Then add one hour until 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n 44. We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 45.

But we are to write the data without code.\n\n 47. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 48. We have the 24 values (the daily pattern) and we repeat them 4 times.\n\n 49. Let's write the first 24 (day1: 2017-10-08) with the pattern above, then the next 24 (day2: 2017-10-09) same pattern, etc.\n\n 50.

We must be cautious: the last day of the forecast is 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n 52. We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 53. Since the pattern repeats, we can just write the first day and then copy it 4 times? But we have to write 96 lines.\n\n 54.

We have the pattern list of 24 values.\n\n 56. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 57. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 58. We'll do it manually for 96 lines? That's tedious, but we can write a program to generate the text? But we are to output.\n\n 59. Since we are an AI, we can generate the string.\n\n 60. But the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 61. We'll generate the 96 lines in the required format.\n\n 62. We'll write the 96 lines in the answer.\n\n 63. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without considering missing values because we are using an average method.\n\n 64. We are ready.\n\n 65. Let's write the answer.\n",
