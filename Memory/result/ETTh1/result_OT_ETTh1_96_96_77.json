        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-05-05 00:00:00 to 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-05-09 00:00:00 to 2017-05-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. \n    However, the provided sample for the past 96 points is complete. So for forecasting, we assume the past data is complete for modeling.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the seasonality (daily patterns are visible), we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any)\n    - Seasonality (daily: 24 hours, and possibly weekly? but we only have 4 days so weekly is not apparent)\n    - Autocorrelation\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, and the data is at hourly frequency, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n    - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that we only have 4 days (96 points) of history. This is a very short series for fitting a model with daily seasonality (24 periods) and we are forecasting 4 days (96 points) ahead.\n\n 5. Given the limited data, we might use a simpler model. Let's observe the data:\n    - The temperature shows a daily cycle: lower at night, higher during the day.\n    - The pattern is not exactly the same every day, but there are similarities.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    We can use a naive seasonal model: forecast each hour of the day by the average of that hour in the past 4 days? \n    But 4 days is very few for averaging. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? \n    But that would be a naive seasonal forecast of order 24.\n\n    However, note that the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. \n    So we can use the entire 96 points.\n\n 7. We can try to fit a SARIMA model. But with only 4 days, the model might be overfit. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we will use a simple method: \n    We compute the average of each hour of the day over the available 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (which are 4*24=96 hours).\n\n    Steps for the method:\n      - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n      - For each hour, compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n    Why this method?\n      - It captures the daily seasonality.\n      - It is simple and robust with little data.\n\n 9. But note: the data shows a possible trend? Let's check the overall level:\n        Day1: 2017-05-05: min ~13.9, max ~20.3\n        Day2: 2017-05-06: min ~14.8, max ~20.1\n        Day3: 2017-05-07: min ~13.8, max ~19.4\n        Day4: 2017-05-08: min ~12.5, max ~17.2\n\n    There is a downward trend? But we don't have enough data to confirm. Also, the problem doesn't specify the time of year, but it's May.\n\n    Since we are only forecasting 4 days, and we don't have a strong trend in 4 days (it's noisy), we can ignore trend and just use the seasonal average.\n\n 10. Implementation:\n\n      We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00:00) we have 4 values: \n          2017-05-05 00:00:00 -> 16.813000\n          2017-05-06 00:00:00 -> 16.108999\n          2017-05-07 00:00:00 -> 16.320999\n          2017-05-08 00:00:00 -> 17.024000\n\n      The average for hour 0: (16.813 + 16.109 + 16.321 + 17.024) / 4 = ?\n\n      We do this for each hour (0 to 23).\n\n      Then, for the next 4 days (2017-05-09 to 2017-05-12), we assign:\n          Day1 (2017-05-09): hour0, hour1, ... hour23 -> the averages for hour0, hour1, ... hour23.\n          Day2 (2017-05-10): same averages\n          Day3 (2017-05-11): same averages\n          Day4 (2017-05-12): same averages\n\n 11. However, note that the last day (2017-05-08) has a lower overall temperature. If we average, we are smoothing out the recent drop? \n     But without more data, we cannot know if the drop is a trend or just a one-day event.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-08) as the base and then adjust by the average daily pattern? \n     But the problem does not specify any method, and we are to be practical.\n\n 13. We'll go with the average by hour for the 4 days. This is a common approach for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n\n 14. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n 15. Steps for the next 96 hours:\n\n      Start time: 2017-05-09 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-05-08 23:00:00)\n\n      We generate 96 hours: \n          2017-05-09 00:00:00 -> average of hour0\n          2017-05-09 01:00:00 -> average of hour1\n          ...\n          2017-05-09 23:00:00 -> average of hour23\n          2017-05-10 00:00:00 -> average of hour0\n          ... and so on until 2017-05-12 23:00:00.\n\n 16. Let's compute the averages:\n\n      We'll extract the data by hour.\n\n 17. But note: the provided data is exactly 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). We can reshape into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n 18. Example for hour0 (index 0, 24, 48, 72): \n        values: [16.813000, 16.108999, 16.320999, 17.024000] -> average = (16.813+16.109+16.321+17.024)/4 = 66.266998/4 = 16.5667495\n\n 19. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 20. We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the original data.\n\n 21. However, note: the original data has up to 3 decimal places.\n\n 22. Let's compute:\n\n      hour0: (16.813 + 16.109 + 16.321 + 17.024) / 4 = 66.267 / 4 = 16.56675 -> 16.567\n      hour1: (16.461 + 16.109 + 16.954 + 16.109) / 4 -> \n          16.461 + 16.109 = 32.57\n          +16.954 = 49.524\n          +16.109 = 65.633 -> 65.633/4 = 16.40825 -> 16.408\n\n     But wait, the hour1 data:\n          2017-05-05 01:00:00: 16.461\n          2017-05-06 01:00:00: 16.109 (but the data for 2017-05-06 01:00:00 is 16.108999 -> 16.109)\n          2017-05-07 01:00:00: 16.954\n          2017-05-08 01:00:00: 16.108999 -> 16.109\n\n     Actually, the data for 2017-05-06 01:00:00 is 16.108999 and 2017-05-08 01:00:00 is 16.108999? \n        But in the data, 2017-05-08 01:00:00 is 16.108999? Actually, the data for 2017-05-08 01:00:00 is 16.108999? \n        Let me check: \n          2017-05-08 00:00:00: 17.024000\n          2017-05-08 01:00:00: 16.108999 -> yes.\n\n     So hour1: 16.461, 16.109, 16.954, 16.109 -> \n        = (16.461 + 16.109 + 16.954 + 16.109) = 65.633 -> 65.633/4 = 16.40825 -> 16.408\n\n 23. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 24. However, note: the data for 2017-05-08 has a drop. This method will smooth that drop.\n\n 25. We'll compute the averages for each hour and then replicate for 4 days.\n\n 26. Code for computation (we do it manually for 24 hours):\n\n      We'll list the 96 data points in order and then group by hour:\n\n        hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n        hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73\n        ... \n        hour23: indices 23, 47, 71, 95\n\n 27. We'll compute the average for each hour.\n\n 28. Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-09 00:00:00 to 2017-05-12 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-05-09): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day2 (2017-05-10): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day3 (2017-05-11): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day4 (2017-05-12): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n 29. We must generate the dates as well.\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages = []\n\n     We have the data in a list? We can write:\n\n        data = [16.813000, 16.461000, ... , 15.406000]   # 96 values\n\n        for hour in range(24):\n            indices = [hour + 24*i for i in range(4)]\n            total = 0\n            for idx in indices:\n                total += data[idx]\n            avg = total / 4\n            # round to 3 decimals\n            avg = round(avg, 3)\n            averages.append(avg)\n\n 31. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n        forecast = []\n        # 4 days\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                forecast.append(averages[hour])\n\n 32. Now, generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = '2017-05-08 23:00:00' -> next is '2017-05-09 00:00:00'\n        We can use pandas to generate, but we are not in code. We'll do manually:\n\n        The last date in the given data: 2017-05-08 23:00:00\n        Next date: 2017-05-09 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2017-05-12 23:00:00.\n\n        We can write:\n\n          dates = []\n          start = datetime(2017, 9, 5) -> wait, the last date is 2017-05-08, so next day is 2017-05-09.\n\n          Actually, the last given is 2017-05-08 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-05-09 00:00:00.\n\n          We need 96 hours: 4 days.\n\n          We can generate:\n\n            base_date = datetime(2017, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0)\n            then add 0 hours, 1 hour, ... up to 95 hours.\n\n 33.

Let me write the first day:\n\n        2017-05-09 00:00:00 16.567\n        2017-05-09 01:00:00 16.408\n        2017-05-09 02:00:00 15.652\n        2017-05-09 03:00:00 15.476\n        2017-05-09 04:00:00 15.213\n        2017-05-09 05:00:00 14.157\n        2017-05-09 06:00:00 15.547\n        2017-05-09 07:00:00 15.811\n        2017-05-09 08:00:00 16.075\n        2017-05-09 09:00:00 16.057\n        2017-05-09 10:00:00 16.514\n        2017-05-09 11:00:00 16.831\n        2017-05-09 12:00:00 17.868\n        2017-05-09 13:00:00 18.185\n        2017-05-09 14:00:00 18.677\n        2017-05-09 15:00:00 18.818\n        2017-05-09 16:00:00 18.607\n        2017-05-09 17:00:00 18.941\n        2017-05-09 18:00:00 16.796\n        2017-05-09 19:00:00 16.162\n        2017-05-09 20:00:00 16.057\n        2017-05-09 21:00:00 16.549\n        2017-05-09 22:00:00 16.408\n        2017-05-09 23:00:00 16.497\n\n     Then the next day (2017-05-10) is the same 24 numbers.\n\n 45. We'll write 4 days.\n\n 46. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting without missing values. \n     We are providing a complete forecast.\n\n 47. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 48. Let's code the output (manually we can write the first day and then repeat for the next 3 times? but we have the list of 24 averages, so we can write 4 times the same 24 values with the date incremented.\n\n 49. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        base_date = '2017-05-09'\n        Then for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n                date_str = f\"2017-05-{9+day_offset} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n        But note: May has 31 days, so 9,10,11,12 are all valid.\n\n 50. However, we must be careful: \n        Day0: 9 -> 2017-05-09\n        Day1: 10 -> 2017-05-10\n        Day2: 11 -> 2017-05-11\n        Day3: 12 -> 2017-05-12\n\n 51. We'll write:\n\n        for day in range(9, 13):   # 9,10,11,12\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = f\"2017-05-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = averages[hour]   # the average for that hour\n\n 52. But note: the day must be two digits: 09, 10, 11, 12.\n\n        So we format day as: str(day).zfill(2) or use f\"{day:02}\"\n\n 53. We'll do:\n\n        dates = []\n        for day in [9,10,11,12]:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-05-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                dates.append(date_str)\n\n 54. Then the values: 4 times the averages list.\n\n        values = averages * 4\n\n 55. Then we output: for i in range(96): \n          print(f\"{dates[i]} {values[i]:.3f}\")\n\n 56. But we must write in the answer block.\n\n 57. We have the averages list as:\n\n        averages = [\n            16.567, 16.408, 15.652, 15.476, 15.213, 14.157, 15.547, 15.811,\n            16.075, 16.057, 16.514, 16.831, 17.868, 18.185, 18.677, 18.818,\n            18.607, 18.941, 16.796, 16.162, 16.057, 16.549, 16.408, 16.497\n        ]\n\n 58. Now, we write the output.\n\n 59. Note: the original data had 6 decimal places? but we rounded to 3. The original data had 3 decimal places (like 16.813000 -> 16.813). \n     So we output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 60. We'll write the data in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS value\"\n\n 61. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-05-09 00:00:00 16.567\n        2017-05-09 01:00:00 16.408\n        2017-05-09 02:00:00 15.652\n        ...\n\n 62. We'll generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 63. We note: the day 9,10,11,12 are all in May 2017.\n\n 64. We output.\n",
