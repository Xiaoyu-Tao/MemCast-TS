        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 4. The data might have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete? We are told to be aware of missing values, but the given data does not have any missing in the provided 96 points.\n\n However, for forecasting, we must handle the time series appropriately.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data shows daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete set of 96 forecasted values, we can use a simple yet effective method such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (last day) as the forecast for the next days? But note: the last day (2017-07-23) is a Sunday? and we are forecasting the next 4 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?).\n\n However, looking at the dates:\n   - 2017-07-20: Thursday\n   - 2017-07-21: Friday\n   - 2017-07-22: Saturday\n   - 2017-07-23: Sunday\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours starting from 2017-07-24 00:00:00 (Monday) to 2017-07-27 23:00:00 (Thursday).\n\n But note: the pattern might differ by day of the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour of the same day of the week? But we only have one week of data? Actually, we have 4 days: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n We don't have multiple weeks, so we cannot average by day of week.\n\n Another idea: use the last week's same day? But we don't have a Monday in the history.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality and the trend. However, with only 4 days, it's challenging.\n\n We can try:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24)\n   - Or a simple moving average of the last 24 hours, but that would not capture the weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data.\n\n But note: the data is only 4 days. We can use a seasonal naive for the next day by taking the same day of the previous week? But we don't have a Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? That is, for hour 00:00, average the values of 2017-07-20 00:00, 2017-07-21 00:00, 2017-07-22 00:00, 2017-07-23 00:00 and use that for 2017-07-24 00:00, and similarly for other hours.\n\n However, note that the days of the week are different. We have:\n   - Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n The next 4 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n We don't have Monday in the history, so we cannot use the same day of the week.\n\n Another idea: use the entire 4 days to compute an hourly profile and then repeat that for the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend.\n\n Since the data is not long enough to capture weekly seasonality, we might assume that the daily pattern is similar and use the average daily pattern.\n\n Steps for average daily pattern:\n   - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n   - Then for the next 4 days, we use that same hourly pattern.\n\n But note: the data has a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n   - The first day (2017-07-20): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n   - The second day: similar?\n\n We can compute the overall level for each day and then adjust the forecast by the trend? But 4 days is too short for a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Sunday) as the base and then adjust by the average change from Sunday to Monday? But we don't have Monday.\n\n Given the lack of data, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. For the forecast, we are to provide 96 points without missing.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (0.711 + 1.279 + 2.132 + 1.315) / 4 = (0.711+1.279=1.99; 1.99+2.132=4.122; 4.122+1.315=5.437) /4 = 1.35925\n   hour1: (0.569+1.599+1.457+1.350)/4 = (0.569+1.599=2.168; 2.168+1.457=3.625; 3.625+1.350=4.975)/4 = 1.24375\n\n But wait, the data for the same hour across days might be different because of the day of the week. However, without multiple weeks, we cannot account for weekly seasonality.\n\n We decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form a daily profile, and then repeat that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   - Create a list of 24 values, each being the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n   - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n However, note: the last day in the history is Sunday, and the next day is Monday. It might be that Monday has a different pattern? But we don't have data to support that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last complete day (Sunday) as the pattern for Monday? But that might be more representative for a Monday? Not necessarily.\n\n Since we don't have information about the weekly seasonality, we are forced to use the average of the available days.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour00: (0.711, 1.279, 2.132, 1.315) -> mean = (0.711+1.279+2.132+1.315)/4 = 5.437/4 = 1.35925\n   hour01: (0.569, 1.599, 1.457, 1.350) -> 4.975/4 = 1.24375\n   hour02: (2.523, 2.097, 1.777, 1.599) -> (2.523+2.097=4.62; 4.62+1.777=6.397; 6.397+1.599=7.996) -> 7.996/4 = 1.999\n   hour03: (0.497, 1.741, 1.031, 1.457) -> (0.497+1.741=2.238; 2.238+1.031=3.269; 3.269+1.457=4.726) -> 4.726/4 = 1.1815\n   hour04: (0.853, 1.315, 1.421, 1.137) -> (0.853+1.315=2.168; 2.168+1.421=3.589; 3.589+1.137=4.726) -> 4.726/4 = 1.1815\n   hour05: (0.711, 0.640, 1.102, 1.492) -> (0.711+0.640=1.351; 1.351+1.102=2.453; 2.453+1.492=3.945) -> 3.945/4 = 0.98625\n   hour06: (0.604, 0.320, 0.569, 1.031) -> (0.604+0.320=0.924; 0.924+0.569=1.493; 1.493+1.031=2.524) -> 2.524/4 = 0.631\n   hour07: (1.812, 1.137, 1.706, 1.421) -> (1.812+1.137=2.949; 2.949+1.706=4.655; 4.655+1.421=6.076) -> 6.076/4 = 1.519\n   hour08: (1.208, 2.061, 1.279, 1.635) -> (1.208+2.061=3.269; 3.269+1.279=4.548; 4.548+1.635=6.183) -> 6.183/4 = 1.54575\n   hour09: (1.421, 1.173, 1.599, 1.350) -> (1.421+1.173=2.594; 2.594+1.599=4.193; 4.193+1.350=5.543) -> 5.543/4 = 1.38575\n   hour10: (2.239, 1.670, 2.097, 2.168) -> (2.239+1.670=3.909; 3.909+2.097=6.006; 6.006+2.168=8.174) -> 8.174/4 = 2.0435\n   hour11: (2.452, 2.878, 2.843, 3.802) -> (2.452+2.878=5.33; 5.33+2.843=8.173; 8.173+3.802=11.975) -> 11.975/4 = 2.99375\n   hour12: (2.843, 3.447, 2.843, 2.949) -> (2.843+3.447=6.29; 6.29+2.843=9.133; 9.133+2.949=12.082) -> 12.082/4 = 3.0205\n   hour13: (3.909, 3.092, 2.452, 3.305) -> (3.909+3.092=7.001; 7.001+2.452=9.453; 9.453+3.305=12.758) -> 12.758/4 = 3.1895\n   hour14: (3.127, 2.523, 2.594, 2.381) -> (3.127+2.523=5.65; 5.65+2.594=8.244; 8.244+2.381=10.625) -> 10.625/4 = 2.65625\n   hour15: (1.883, 1.812, 1.457, 1.492) -> (1.883+1.812=3.695; 3.695+1.457=5.152; 5.152+1.492=6.644) -> 6.644/4 = 1.661\n   hour16: (0.462, 0.959, 1.457, 1.137) -> (0.462+0.959=1.421; 1.421+1.457=2.878; 2.878+1.137=4.015) -> 4.015/4 = 1.00375\n   hour17: (0.000, 0.355, 0.569, 0.320) -> (0.000+0.355=0.355; 0.355+0.569=0.924; 0.924+0.320=1.244) -> 1.244/4 = 0.311\n   hour18: (-0.888, -0.355, -0.107, -0.213) -> (-0.888-0.355=-1.243; -1.243-0.107=-1.35; -1.35-0.213=-1.563) -> -1.563/4 = -0.39075\n   hour19: (-0.746, -0.569, -0.497, -0.355) -> (-0.746-0.569=-1.315; -1.315-0.497=-1.812; -1.812-0.355=-2.167) -> -2.167/4 = -0.54175\n   hour20: (-0.178, -0.178, 0.320, 0.249) -> (-0.178-0.178=-0.356; -0.356+0.320=-0.036; -0.036+0.249=0.213) -> 0.213/4 = 0.05325\n   hour21: (0.142, -1.244, -0.675, 0.711) -> (0.142-1.244=-1.102; -1.102-0.675=-1.777; -1.777+0.711=-1.066) -> -1.066/4 = -0.2665\n   hour22: (0.249, 0.533, 0.249, 0.426) -> (0.249+0.533=0.782; 0.782+0.249=1.031; 1.031+0.426=1.457) -> 1.457/4 = 0.36425\n   hour23: (0.391, 0.462, 0.746, 1.457) -> (0.391+0.462=0.853; 0.853+0.746=1.599; 1.599+1.457=3.056) -> 3.056/4 = 0.764\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n   Day1 (Monday): [1.35925, 1.24375, 1.999, 1.1815, 1.1815, 0.98625, 0.631, 1.519, 1.54575, 1.38575, 2.0435, 2.99375, 3.0205, 3.1895, 2.65625, 1.661, 1.00375, 0.311, -0.39075, -0.54175, 0.05325, -0.2665, 0.36425, 0.764]\n   Day2 (Tuesday): same 24 numbers\n   Day3 (Wednesday): same\n   Day4 (Thursday): same\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data.

But we are not running code, so we write the list.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a loop in text.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-24 00:00:00  1.359\n2017-07-24 01:00:00  1.244\n2017-07-24 02:00:00  1.999\n2017-07-24 03:00:00  1.182\n2017-07-24 04:00:00  1.182\n2017-07-24 05:00:00  0.986\n2017-07-24 06:00:00  0.631\n2017-07-24 07:00:00  1.519\n2017-07-24 08:00:00  1.546\n2017-07-24 09:00:00  1.386\n2017-07-24 10:00:00  2.044\n2017-07-24 11:00:00  2.994\n2017-07-24 12:00:00  3.021\n2017-07-24 13:00:00  3.190\n2017-07-24 14:00:00  2.656\n2017-07-24 15:00:00  1.661\n2017-07-24 16:00:00  1.004\n2017-07-24 17:00:00  0.311\n2017-07-24 18:00:00  -0.391\n2017-07-24 19:00:00  -0.542\n2017-07-24 20:00:00  0.053\n2017-07-24 21:00:00  -0.267\n2017-07-24 22:00:00  0.364\n2017-07-24 23:00:00  0.764\n2017-07-25 00:00:00  1.359\n2017-07-25 01:00:00  1.244\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n We'll write 96 lines.\n\n But note: the last line should be 2017-07-27 23:00:00.\n\n We have 4 days: 24*4=96.\n\n We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n However, to save space in the response, we write the first day and then note that we repeat the same pattern for the next three days?
