        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we will assume the given 96 points are complete (as they appear to be) and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 3. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively small data size (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency with potential daily seasonality, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal decomposition: but we have only 4 days, so we can assume a daily seasonality of 24 points.\n    - Models: We can use a simple seasonal model like Seasonal Naive, or more advanced models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, or even a simple linear model with seasonal dummies.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (with values dropping during the day and rising at night) but also a trend? Let's observe:\n    - The values on 2016-11-10: from around -1.0 to -0.3 and back to -1.0.\n    - 2016-11-11: similar pattern but with a drop to -1.37 at 21:00.\n    - 2016-11-12: again similar, and 2016-11-13: similar but ending at -1.218.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we might use a complex model but with caution. We are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history.\n\n 6. We are going to use a model that can capture seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we can use a seasonal naive model for the forecast of the next day by taking the same day of the previous week? But we don't have a week. Alternatively, we can take the average of the same hour of the past 4 days? But that would be a mean forecast per hour.\n\n 7. However, note that the data does not have a clear weekly pattern (we only have 4 days, all weekdays? 10th to 13th: Thursday to Sunday). But we don't have a full week to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, a reasonable approach is to use the average of each hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be a constant daily pattern. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-13) as the pattern for the next days? But that might not account for the trend.\n\n 9. Let's look for a trend: The last value is -1.066 (on 2016-11-13 23:00:00) and the first value is -1.066 (on 2016-11-10 00:00:00). The overall level seems stable? But the last day (2016-11-13) has a lower minimum? Actually, the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n 10. We can try a simple method: \n     - Compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days, and use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 11. Steps for the method:\n     - Group the data by hour (i.e., for hour 0: the 4 values at 00:00:00, hour 1: 4 values at 01:00:00, ... hour 23: 4 values at 23:00:00).\n     - Compute the mean for each hour (if we have 4 values, we take the average). This will give us 24 values (one for each hour).\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00), we assign the corresponding hourly average.\n\n 12. Why this method? \n     - It captures the daily seasonality and averages out the day-to-day variations. Since we don't have a clear trend and the data is short, this is a robust method.\n\n 13. However, note that the data might have a slight trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to model a trend. Also, the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are using the available data.\n\n 14. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 data points.\n\n     Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n       2016-11-10: -1.066\n       2016-11-11: -0.579\n       2016-11-12: -1.127\n       2016-11-13: -0.305\n       Average = (-1.066 -0.579 -1.127 -0.305) / 4 = (-3.077) / 4 = -0.76925\n\n     Similarly for the rest.\n\n 15. We will create a list of 24 average values (for hours 0 to 23). Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours) we will repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 16. The next 96 dates start from 2016-11-14 00:00:00 and go hourly until 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n\n 17. Format: We must output the complete data in the same format as the input, but for the next 96 dates.\n\n 18. Implementation:\n\n     Step 1: Parse the given data and group by hour of day.\n     Step 2: Compute the mean for each hour (ignoring any NaN? but we don't have any in the given data).\n     Step 3: Generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2016-11-14 00:00:00, then 2016-11-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n     Step 4: For each timestamp, assign the average value corresponding to its hour.\n\n 19. However, note: the last given date is 2016-11-13 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-11-14 00:00:00.\n\n 20. Let's code this in our mind:\n\n     hours = [0,1,2,...,23]\n     avg_hour = {}\n     for hour in hours:\n         values = [all values at that hour from the 4 days]\n         avg_hour[hour] = mean(values)\n\n     Then for the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours):\n\n        day1: 2016-11-14, hour0 -> avg_hour[0]\n        day1: 2016-11-14, hour1 -> avg_hour[1]\n        ...\n        day1: 2016-11-14, hour23 -> avg_hour[23]\n        day2: 2016-11-15, hour0 -> avg_hour[0]\n        ... until day4: 2016-11-17, hour23 -> avg_hour[23]\n\n 21. We must output the data frame with two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'.\n\n 22. Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we proceed.\n\n 23. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll list the data by hour:\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00:00): [-1.066, -0.579, -1.127, -0.305] -> mean = (-1.066 -0.579 -1.127 -0.305)/4 = -3.077/4 = -0.76925\n     Hour 1 (01:00:00): [-1.066, -0.579, -1.097, -0.457] -> (-1.066-0.579-1.097-0.457) = -3.199/4 = -0.79975\n     Hour 2 (02:00:00): [-1.127, -0.640, -1.157, -0.457] -> (-1.127-0.640-1.157-0.457) = -3.381/4 = -0.84525\n     Hour 3 (03:00:00): [-1.188, -0.548, -1.157, -0.305] -> (-1.188-0.548-1.157-0.305) = -3.198/4 = -0.7995\n     Hour 4 (04:00:00): [-1.157, -0.579, -1.127, -0.366] -> (-1.157-0.579-1.127-0.366) = -3.229/4 = -0.80725\n     Hour 5 (05:00:00): [-1.127, -0.487, -0.670, -0.487] -> (-1.127-0.487-0.670-0.487) = -2.771/4 = -0.69275\n     Hour 6 (06:00:00): [-1.066, -0.548, -0.548, -0.457] -> (-1.066-0.548-0.548-0.457) = -2.619/4 = -0.65475\n     Hour 7 (07:00:00): [-0.944, -0.457, -0.244, -0.305] -> (-0.944-0.457-0.244-0.305) = -1.95/4 = -0.4875\n     Hour 8 (08:00:00): [-0.640, -0.609, -0.579, -0.548] -> (-0.640-0.609-0.579-0.548) = -2.376/4 = -0.594\n     Hour 9 (09:00:00): [-0.670, -0.670, -0.579, -0.701] -> (-0.670-0.670-0.579-0.701) = -2.62/4 = -0.655\n     Hour 10 (10:00:00): [-0.640, -0.548, -0.244, -0.335] -> (-0.640-0.548-0.244-0.335) = -1.767/4 = -0.44175\n     Hour 11 (11:00:00): [-0.731, -0.609, -0.457, -0.579] -> (-0.731-0.609-0.457-0.579) = -2.376/4 = -0.594\n     Hour 12 (12:00:00): [-0.883, -0.761, -0.609, -0.761] -> (-0.883-0.761-0.609-0.761) = -3.014/4 = -0.7535\n     Hour 13 (13:00:00): [-0.518, -0.640, -0.487, -0.518] -> (-0.518-0.640-0.487-0.518) = -2.163/4 = -0.54075\n     Hour 14 (14:00:00): [-0.579, -0.731, -0.366, -0.579] -> (-0.579-0.731-0.366-0.579) = -2.255/4 = -0.56375\n     Hour 15 (15:00:00): [-0.579, -0.701, -0.335, -0.701] -> (-0.579-0.701-0.335-0.701) = -2.316/4 = -0.579\n     Hour 16 (16:00:00): [-0.305, -0.731, -0.305, -0.609] -> (-0.305-0.731-0.305-0.609) = -1.95/4 = -0.4875\n     Hour 17 (17:00:00): [-0.183, -0.914, -0.396, -0.822] -> (-0.183-0.914-0.396-0.822) = -2.315/4 = -0.57875\n     Hour 18 (18:00:00): [-0.731, -0.944, -0.731, -0.701] -> (-0.731-0.944-0.731-0.701) = -3.107/4 = -0.77675\n     Hour 19 (19:00:00): [-0.975, -1.036, -0.731, -1.005] -> (-0.975-1.036-0.731-1.005) = -3.747/4 = -0.93675\n     Hour 20 (20:00:00): [-0.975, -1.066, -0.883, -1.066] -> (-0.975-1.066-0.883-1.066) = -3.99/4 = -0.9975\n     Hour 21 (21:00:00): [-1.036, -1.371, -0.883, -1.157] -> (-1.036-1.371-0.883-1.157) = -4.447/4 = -1.11175\n     Hour 22 (22:00:00): [-1.066, -1.005, -0.975, -1.218] -> (-1.066-1.005-0.975-1.218) = -4.264/4 = -1.066\n     Hour 23 (23:00:00): [-1.005, -1.097, -0.853, -1.066] -> (-1.005-1.097-0.853-1.066) = -4.021/4 = -1.00525\n\n 24. Now, we generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n     Start: 2016-11-14 00:00:00\n     End: 2016-11-17 23:00:00\n\n 25. We'll create a list:\n\n     date = []\n     value = []\n\n     for day in range(4):   # 4 days: 14,15,16,17\n         for hour in range(24):\n             date_str = f\"2016-11-{14+day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n             value = avg_hour[hour]\n\n 26. But note: the day after 2016-11-14 is 2016-11-15, then 16, then 17.\n\n 27. We must be in the same format: the date string must be exactly as the input.\n\n 28. Let's write the output in the required format.\n\n 29. We'll round the values to 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places.\n\n 30. However, note: the input has negative values and we computed averages that are floats. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 31. But the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format is two columns: date and LULL.\n\n 32. We output in the same structure as the input, but for the next 96 points.\n\n 33. Let's code the output:\n\n     We have the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n        hour0: -0.769\n        hour1: -0.800\n        hour2: -0.845\n        hour3: -0.800\n        hour4: -0.807\n        hour5: -0.693\n        hour6: -0.655\n        hour7: -0.488\n        hour8: -0.594\n        hour9: -0.655\n        hour10: -0.442\n        hour11: -0.594\n        hour12: -0.754\n        hour13: -0.541\n        hour14: -0.564\n        hour15: -0.579\n        hour16: -0.488\n        hour17: -0.579\n        hour18: -0.777\n        hour19: -0.937\n        hour20: -0.998\n        hour21: -1.112\n        hour22: -1.066\n        hour23: -1.005\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 34. But note: the rounding: we computed the averages and then rounded to 3 decimals. However, the original data had 3 decimals.\n\n 35. We'll generate the data:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-11-14\n        00:00:00 -> -0.769\n        01:00:00 -> -0.800\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> -1.005\n\n     Day 2: 2016-11-15: same pattern\n\n     Day 3: 2016-11-16: same pattern\n\n     Day 4: 2016-11-17: same pattern\n\n 36. Write the output in the required answer block.\n\n 37. Note: The dates must be in increasing order and exactly 96 rows.\n\n 38. We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-14 00:00:00 -0.769\n2016-11-14 01:00:00 -0.800\n... (all 96 rows)\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 39. Let's generate the dates:\n\n     We have:\n        Day 1: 2016-11-14 (Monday? but we don't care for the pattern, we are using the same pattern for all days)\n\n     We'll generate:\n\n        dates = []\n        for day_offset in range(4):   # 0 to 3 -> 14,15,16,17\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = f\"2016-11-{14+day_offset} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\"\n\n     But note: 2016-11-14 is the first day.\n\n 40. However, the day after 2016-11-14 is 2016-11-15, then 16, then 17.\n\n 41. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 42. We have the list of 24 values (the averages) in order of hour 0 to 23.\n\n 43. Code for the output:\n\n        values = [-0.769, -0.800, -0.845, -0.800, -0.807, -0.693, -0.655, -0.488, -0.594, -0.655, -0.442, -0.594, -0.754, -0.541, -0.564, -0.579, -0.488, -0.579, -0.777, -0.937, -0.998, -1.112, -1.066, -1.005]\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour_idx, val in enumerate(values):\n                date_str = f\"2016-11-{14+day} {hour_idx:02d}:00:00\"\n                # Format the value to 3 decimal places\n                print(f\"{date_str} {val:.3f}\")\n\n 44. But note: the day 14,15,16,17: we sure that 2016-11-14 is the next day? Yes, because the last given day is 2016-11-13.\n\n 45. However, we must be cautious: 2016-11-13 is the last day, so the next day is 2016-11-14.\n\n 46. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00 -0.769\n        2016-11-14 01:00:00 -0.800\n        2016-11-14 02:00:00 -0.845\n        ...\n\n 47. We'll output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 48. But note: the rounding we did for the averages: we rounded to 3 decimals. However, the original averages were computed with more precision. We rounded to 3 decimals to match the input.\n\n 49. We'll use the rounded values as above.\n\n 50. Let's write the answer.\n",
