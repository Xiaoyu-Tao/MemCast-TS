        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-30 00:00:00 to 2017-04-02 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing (all hours are present). However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We must provide the complete forecast for the next 96 dates.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a model that handles the characteristics of the data.\n The data shows:\n   - A daily pattern (observe the values at the same hour each day: for example, high during the day and low at night? but note: the pattern is not entirely clear and there is volatility).\n   - Also, there might be a weekly pattern? but we only have 4 days so we cannot see weekly.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days (96 hours). We are to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Given the limited data, we can use a simple model or a more sophisticated one. But note: we are to provide the forecast.\n\n We can use:\n   - ARIMA: but we have to determine parameters (p,d,q) and also consider seasonality (24 hours cycle).\n   - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality): such as Holt-Winters.\n   - Or a simple approach: use the average of the same hour in the past days? but we only have 4 days.\n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n But note: the data provided is only 4 days. We cannot capture weekly seasonality (which is 168 hours) with 4 days.\n\n Since the data is very limited, we can use a model that uses daily seasonality.\n\n Let's try to use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? or use a model that automatically handles seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with a seasonal period of 24.\n\n Steps for SARIMA:\n   - We need to check for stationarity and seasonality.\n   - We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters? but we are not running code, we are to reason.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n   - The last 4 days show a pattern that repeats? but looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same.\n\n However, the problem does not require a specific method. We are to provide the forecast.\n\n Considering the time and the fact that we are to provide the data, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the available 4 days.\n\n But note: the data starts at 2017-03-26 and ends at 2017-03-29 (4 days). We are to forecast 2017-03-30 to 2017-04-02 (next 4 days).\n\n How about:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) of day d (where d=0: 2017-03-26, d=1: 2017-03-27, d=2: 2017-03-28, d=3: 2017-03-29), \n   we compute the average for that hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But wait, the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (2017-03-29) the values seem to be lower in the evening? \n However, without more data, we cannot be sure.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-29) as the forecast for the next day? but that would be naive.\n\n Given the instructions, we must provide the forecast. We choose a method that is reasonable.\n\n We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n Steps:\n   - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n Example:\n     Hour 00:00: (-0.853 + 0.178 + 0.249 -0.675) / 4 = (-1.101) / 4 = -0.27525\n     Hour 01:00: (0.853 -0.178 +0.142 -1.457) /4 = (0.853-0.178=0.675; 0.675+0.142=0.817; 0.817-1.457=-0.64) -> -0.64/4 = -0.16\n\n But note: the data for the same hour might have a trend? we ignore for simplicity.\n\n However, we must also consider that the data might have a downward trend? but 4 days is too short.\n\n We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat these 24 average values 4 times.\n\n But note: the last day (2017-03-29) has a different pattern? especially in the evening (more negative). \n However, without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n We'll create a list of 24 values (each being the average of that hour).\n\n Then the forecast for:\n   2017-03-30 00:00:00 -> average of 00:00\n   2017-03-30 01:00:00 -> average of 01:00\n   ... until\n   2017-04-02 23:00:00 -> average of 23:00 (repeated for the 4th time)\n\n However, note: the data provided ends at 2017-03-29 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours are:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-03-30 00:00 to 23:00\n   Day 2: 2017-03-31 00:00 to 23:00\n   Day 3: 2017-04-01 00:00 to 23:00\n   Day 4: 2017-04-02 00:00 to 23:00\n\n We'll compute the averages:\n\n   Hour 00: [ -0.853, 0.178, 0.249, -0.675 ] -> (-0.101) -> -0.101\n   Hour 01: [ 0.853, -0.178, 0.142, -1.457 ] -> (0.853-0.178=0.675; 0.675+0.142=0.817; 0.817-1.457=-0.64) -> -0.64/4 = -0.16\n   ... \n\n But we must do it for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the data has 4 days and 24 hours per day -> 96 points.\n\n We can write a small program in our mind? but we can do it step by step.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more robust method: since the data is volatile, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n But for simplicity and given the instructions, we use the average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n  00: (-0.853 + 0.178 + 0.249 - 0.675) / 4 = (-0.853 -0.675 = -1.528; 0.178+0.249=0.427; -1.528+0.427 = -1.101) -> -1.101/4 = -0.27525\n  01: (0.853 -0.178 +0.142 -1.457) = (0.853+0.142=0.995; -0.178-1.457=-1.635; 0.995-1.635 = -0.64) -> -0.64/4 = -0.16\n  02: (-0.036 -0.391 +0.426 -0.213) = (-0.036-0.391=-0.427; 0.426-0.213=0.213; -0.427+0.213=-0.214) -> -0.214/4 = -0.0535\n  03: (0.426 +0.355 -0.249 -1.635) = (0.426+0.355=0.781; -0.249-1.635=-1.884; 0.781-1.884=-1.103) -> -1.103/4 = -0.27575\n  04: (-0.497 +0.213 +0.533 +0.178) = (-0.497+0.213=-0.284; 0.533+0.178=0.711; -0.284+0.711=0.427) -> 0.427/4 = 0.10675\n  05: (-0.497 -0.355 -0.426 -0.711) = (-0.497-0.355=-0.852; -0.426-0.711=-1.137; -0.852-1.137=-1.989) -> -1.989/4 = -0.49725\n  06: (-0.355 -0.426 -0.249 -0.249) = (-0.355-0.426=-0.781; -0.249-0.249=-0.498; -0.781-0.498=-1.279) -> -1.279/4 = -0.31975\n  07: (-0.640 -0.462 +0.675 -0.817) = (-0.640-0.462=-1.102; 0.675-0.817=-0.142; -1.102-0.142=-1.244) -> -1.244/4 = -0.311\n  08: (0.853 +0.355 +0.426 -0.462) = (0.853+0.355=1.208; 0.426-0.462=-0.036; 1.208-0.036=1.172) -> 1.172/4 = 0.293\n  09: (0.320 +1.421 +0.640 -0.284) = (0.320+1.421=1.741; 0.640-0.284=0.356; 1.741+0.356=2.097) -> 2.097/4 = 0.52425\n  10: (1.244 +1.492 +0.640 -0.462) = (1.244+1.492=2.736; 0.640-0.462=0.178; 2.736+0.178=2.914) -> 2.914/4 = 0.7285\n  11: (2.274 +2.061 +0.533 -0.746) = (2.274+2.061=4.335; 0.533-0.746=-0.213; 4.335-0.213=4.122) -> 4.122/4 = 1.0305\n  12: (1.421 +1.102 -1.670 +0.604) = (1.421+1.102=2.523; -1.670+0.604=-1.066; 2.523-1.066=1.457) -> 1.457/4 = 0.36425\n  13: (2.239 +2.310 -1.421 +1.564) = (2.239+2.310=4.549; -1.421+1.564=0.143; 4.549+0.143=4.692) -> 4.692/4 = 1.173\n  14: (1.564 +0.924 -0.746 +1.635) = (1.564+0.924=2.488; -0.746+1.635=0.889; 2.488+0.889=3.377) -> 3.377/4 = 0.84425\n  15: (0.569 +2.025 -1.599 +0.604) = (0.569+2.025=2.594; -1.599+0.604=-0.995; 2.594-0.995=1.599) -> 1.599/4 = 0.39975\n  16: (-0.036 +0.000 -1.741 -0.142) = (-0.036+0.000=-0.036; -1.741-0.142=-1.883; -0.036-1.883=-1.919) -> -1.919/4 = -0.47975\n  17: (-1.457 -1.279 -1.919 -1.812) = (-1.457-1.279=-2.736; -1.919-1.812=-3.731; -2.736-3.731=-6.467) -> -6.467/4 = -1.61675\n  18: (-2.416 -2.239 -2.239 -2.168) = (-2.416-2.239=-4.655; -2.239-2.168=-4.407; -4.655-4.407=-9.062) -> -9.062/4 = -2.2655\n  19: (-2.132 -2.239 -2.132 -2.345) = (-2.132-2.239=-4.371; -2.132-2.345=-4.477; -4.371-4.477=-8.848) -> -8.848/4 = -2.212\n  20: (-2.310 -2.132 -2.097 -2.345) = (-2.310-2.132=-4.442; -2.097-2.345=-4.442; -4.442-4.442=-8.884) -> -8.884/4 = -2.221\n  21: (-1.066 -2.239 -2.701 -2.630) = (-1.066-2.239=-3.305; -2.701-2.630=-5.331; -3.305-5.331=-8.636) -> -8.636/4 = -2.159\n  22: (-1.848 -1.706 -2.630 -0.782) = (-1.848-1.706=-3.554; -2.630-0.782=-3.412; -3.554-3.412=-6.966) -> -6.966/4 = -1.7415\n  23: (-0.462 +0.249 -1.457 +0.533) = (-0.462+0.249=-0.213; -1.457+0.533=-0.924; -0.213-0.924=-1.137) -> -1.137/4 = -0.28425\n\n So the 24 averages (from hour0 to hour23) are:\n\n  0: -0.27525\n  1: -0.16\n  2: -0.0535\n  3: -0.27575\n  4: 0.10675\n  5: -0.49725\n  6: -0.31975\n  7: -0.311\n  8: 0.293\n  9: 0.52425\n  10: 0.7285\n  11: 1.0305\n  12: 0.36425\n  13: 1.173\n  14: 0.84425\n  15: 0.39975\n  16: -0.47975\n  17: -1.61675\n  18: -2.2655\n  19: -2.212\n  20: -2.221\n  21: -2.159\n  22: -1.7415\n  23: -0.28425\n\n Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is:\n\n   Day1 (2017-03-30): [ -0.27525, -0.16, -0.0535, ... , -0.28425 ]\n   Day2 (2017-03-31): same 24 values\n   Day3 (2017-04-01): same\n   Day4 (2017-04-02): same\n\n But note: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n The last date in the input is 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n The next date is 2017-03-30 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-02 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the dates and then assign the corresponding average value for that hour.\n\n However, note: the data provided is in the format \"2017-03-26 00:00:00\", so we must output in the same format.\n\n We'll write the next 96 dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-03-30 00:00:00\n   End:   2017-04-02 23:00:00\n\n And the MULL values will be the 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n But note: we must round the numbers?

We must not omit any.\n\n We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n But note: the input data has the MULL values with 3 decimal places, so we output with 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n Important: The answer must be enclosed in <answer> and </answer> tags, and the data must be in the same format as the input (with the date and then the MULL value).\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   date (as string) and MULL (as float rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n Steps for generating dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-03-30 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 2017-04-02 23:00:00.\n\n We have 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n We'll create a list of 96 dates.\n\n And then assign the MULL values by:\n\n   For the first 24 hours: use the 24 averages we computed (for hour0 to hour23) for day1.\n   For the next 24: same 24 averages for day2.\n   etc.\n\n We'll write the data in the example format.\n\n Example of one line: \"2017-03-30 00:00:00 -0.275\"\n\n But note: the input had the MULL value in a column with the same name.\n\n We'll output:\n\n        date   MULL\n        2017-03-30 00:00:00 -0.275\n        2017-03-30 01:00:00 -0.160\n        ... \n\n We must be careful: the date string must be exactly as in the input.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n But note: the input had the date in the format \"2017-03-26 00:00:00\", so we use the same.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Day1: 2017-03-30\n   Day2: 2017-03-31\n   Day3: 2017-04-01\n   Day4: 2017-04-02\n\n And for each day, the hours from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n However, note: the method we used (average of the same hour over 4 days) is a simple and common method for short-term forecasting when data is limited.\n\n But if we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model.\n\n Since the problem states we are experts, and we are to provide the forecast, we use this method.\n\n Let's output the data.\n\n Note: We must not omit any content and must provide the complete 96 points.\n\n We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n But note: the format of the answer must be:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date string] [MULL value]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n We'll write the data in a code block.\n\n However, note: the example input had the MULL value with a space and then the number (with a minus sign if negative).\n\n We'll do the same.\n\n Let's generate the 96 lines.\n\n We have the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals) in a list:\n\n   avg = [\n        -0.275, -0.160, -0.054, -0.276, 0.107, -0.497, -0.320, -0.311, \n        0.293, 0.524, 0.729, 1.031, 0.364, 1.173, 0.844, 0.400, \n        -0.480, -1.617, -2.266, -2.212, -2.221, -2.159, -1.742, -0.284\n   ]\n\n Then for day in [30, 31, 1, 2] of the next month? but note:\n\n   March has 31 days, so:\n        2017-03-30, 2017-03-31, then 2017-04-01, 2017-04-02.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date = start_date + day_offset days + hour hours\n\n But we can do:\n\n   base_date = datetime(2017,3,30)\n   then add timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(0,96)\n\n We'll generate the date strings:\n\n   Day0: 2017-03-30\n   Day1: 2017-03-31\n   Day2: 2017-04-01\n   Day3: 2017-04-02\n\n We'll write:\n\n   for i in range(96):\n        date_str = (base_date + timedelta(hours=i)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        mull = avg[i % 24]\n\n But we must be careful: the base_date is 2017-03-30 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   i=0: 2017-03-30 00:00:00 -> avg[0] = -0.275\n   i=1: 2017-03-30 01:00:00 -> avg[1] = -0.160\n   ...\n   i=23: 2017-03-30 23:00:00 -> avg[23] = -0.284\n   i=24: 2017-03-31 00:00:00 -> avg[0] = -0.275\n   i=25: 2017-03-31 01:00:00 -> avg[1] = -0.160\n   ... until i=95: 2017-04-02 23:00:00 -> avg[23] = -0.284\n\n We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n But note: the date for April: 2017-04-01 and 2017-04-02.\n\n We are ready.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the forecast we are not missing any.\n\n We output 96 points.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required format.\n",
