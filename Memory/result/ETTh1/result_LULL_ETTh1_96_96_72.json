        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, the provided sample is complete.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data shows some daily seasonality (as it's hourly and we see patterns repeating every 24 hours),\n we can use a time series method that captures seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints of the problem and that we are to provide a complete answer without the ability to run code, we must use a simple method that can be described and applied consistently.\n\n We can use:\n   - A seasonal naive method: using the last available season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) as the forecast.\n   - However, note that the data might have a strong daily pattern but also a trend? Looking at the data, the values do not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n But note: the data provided is only 4 days. We don't have a long history. Therefore, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n However, the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So for forecasting, we assume the pattern of the last 4 days will repeat? Or we can take the average.\n\n Let's check the pattern:\n\n For example, at 00:00:\n   Day1: 1.371\n   Day2: 0.761\n   Day3: 0.822\n   Day4: 0.975\n\n We see variation. So we can take the average of the same hour for the past 4 days.\n\n But note: the next 4 days might be similar to the last 4 days? We don't know. But without more data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, with only 4 days, we can do:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days (from day5 to day8, i.e., 2017-04-19 to 2017-04-22), we compute:\n\n      forecast_hour_h = (h_day1 + h_day2 + h_day3 + h_day4) / 4\n\n But note: the data we have is for 4 days (from 2017-04-15 to 2017-04-18). So:\n\n   For 2017-04-19 00:00:00 (which is the first hour of the next day, hour0 of day5) we use:\n        (value of 2017-04-15 00:00:00 + 2017-04-16 00:00:00 + 2017-04-17 00:00:00 + 2017-04-18 00:00:00) / 4\n\n   = (1.371 + 0.761 + 0.822 + 0.975) / 4 = ?\n\n Let me calculate:\n      1.371 + 0.761 = 2.132\n      2.132 + 0.822 = 2.954\n      2.954 + 0.975 = 3.929\n      3.929 / 4 = 0.98225 -> approximately 0.982\n\n Similarly, for 2017-04-19 01:00:00, we use the average of the 01:00:00 of the past 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly. Therefore, we stick to the daily pattern.\n\n But wait: the problem says the data is \"Low UseLess Load\", and we are in April. The next 4 days are consecutive days. So using the average of the same hour for the last 4 days is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n   Day1 (2017-04-15): average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n   We can compute quickly: \n        The values range from 0.731 to 1.432. \n        sum_day1 = 1.371+1.310+1.249+1.340+1.066+0.822+0.975+1.097+1.432+1.249+1.340+1.188+1.157+1.218+1.340+1.340+1.249+1.157+1.157+0.914+0.731+0.883+0.853+0.853\n        Let me add step by step:\n\n        First 12: \n          1.371+1.310=2.681, +1.249=3.93, +1.340=5.27, +1.066=6.336, +0.822=7.158, +0.975=8.133, +1.097=9.23, +1.432=10.662, +1.249=11.911, +1.340=13.251, +1.188=14.439, +1.157=15.596\n        Next 12:\n          1.218 -> 16.814, 1.340->18.154, 1.340->19.494, 1.249->20.743, 1.157->21.9, 1.157->23.057, 0.914->23.971, 0.731->24.702, 0.883->25.585, 0.853->26.438, 0.853->27.291\n\n        So average_day1 = 27.291 / 24 = 1.137125\n\n   Day2 (2017-04-16): \n        We have: 0.761,0.792,0.822,0.944,0.975,1.097,1.097,1.249,1.279,1.218,1.310,1.340,1.279,1.157,0.914,1.249,1.005,0.975,0.853,0.761,0.822,0.731,0.792,0.883\n        Sum: \n          0.761+0.792=1.553, +0.822=2.375, +0.944=3.319, +0.975=4.294, +1.097=5.391, +1.097=6.488, +1.249=7.737, +1.279=9.016, +1.218=10.234, +1.310=11.544, +1.340=12.884, +1.279=14.163, +1.157=15.32, +0.914=16.234, +1.249=17.483, +1.005=18.488, +0.975=19.463, +0.853=20.316, +0.761=21.077, +0.822=21.899, +0.731=22.63, +0.792=23.422, +0.883=24.305\n        average_day2 = 24.305 / 24 = 1.012708\n\n   Day3 (2017-04-17): \n        Values: 0.822,0.822,0.853,0.822,0.914,1.036,1.218,1.097,1.340,1.401,1.066,1.036,0.731,0.883,0.975,1.066,1.097,1.157,1.036,0.944,1.127,1.036,0.944,0.975\n        Sum:\n          0.822+0.822=1.644, +0.853=2.497, +0.822=3.319, +0.914=4.233, +1.036=5.269, +1.218=6.487, +1.097=7.584, +1.340=8.924, +1.401=10.325, +1.066=11.391, +1.036=12.427, +0.731=13.158, +0.883=14.041, +0.975=15.016, +1.066=16.082, +1.097=17.179, +1.157=18.336, +1.036=19.372, +0.944=20.316, +1.127=21.443, +1.036=22.479, +0.944=23.423, +0.975=24.398\n        average_day3 = 24.398 / 24 = 1.016583\n\n   Day4 (2017-04-18): \n        Values: 0.975,1.097,0.944,0.853,0.701,0.883,1.005,1.005,1.249,1.097,1.310,1.127,1.066,1.218,1.310,1.279,1.310,1.127,0.853,0.792,0.853,0.822,0.853,0.944\n        Sum:\n          0.975+1.097=2.072, +0.944=3.016, +0.853=3.869, +0.701=4.57, +0.883=5.453, +1.005=6.458, +1.005=7.463, +1.249=8.712, +1.097=9.809, +1.310=11.119, +1.127=12.246, +1.066=13.312, +1.218=14.53, +1.310=15.84, +1.279=17.119, +1.310=18.429, +1.127=19.556, +0.853=20.409, +0.792=21.201, +0.853=22.054, +0.822=22.876, +0.853=23.729, +0.944=24.673\n        average_day4 = 24.673 / 24 = 1.028042\n\n   The daily averages: 1.137, 1.013, 1.017, 1.028 -> no clear trend? It went down then slightly up.\n\n   Therefore, using the average of the same hour for the last 4 days is acceptable.\n\n 4. We generate the next 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) by:\n\n      For hour h in [0,23]:\n          value = (D1_h + D2_h + D3_h + D4_h) / 4\n\n      and then repeat the same set of 24 averaged values for each of the next 4 days? But wait, that would be the same pattern every day.\n\n  However, note: we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same 24-hour pattern for each of the 4 days? But that would be constant per hour across the days.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average for the first day (2017-04-19) and then for the next days, we can use the same pattern? But that would be the same as the first day.\n\n  But the problem: we don't have any information about a trend or a weekly pattern. So we assume that the daily cycle is stable and we use the same 24-hour pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n  However, note: the data we have for the 4 days are not exactly the same. So we are averaging to get a typical day.\n\n  Therefore, we will compute 24 values (for 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) by averaging the 4 days we have for that hour, and then we repeat that same typical day for the next 4 days.\n\n 5. But what if there is a slight trend? We could adjust by adding the average change per day? Let's compute the overall trend:\n\n      The daily averages: \n          Day1: 1.137125\n          Day2: 1.012708 -> change: -0.124417\n          Day3: 1.016583 -> change: +0.003875\n          Day4: 1.028042 -> change: +0.011459\n\n      The average daily change: (-0.124417 + 0.003875 + 0.011459) / 3 = (-0.109083) / 3 = -0.036361\n\n      This is not consistent. So we might not have a clear linear trend.\n\n 6. Therefore, we stick to the typical day.\n\n 7. Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n      Let H0 = [h0_1, h0_2, h0_3, h0_4] = the values at 00:00 for the 4 days -> [1.371, 0.761, 0.822, 0.975] -> average = 0.98225\n      H1 = [1.310, 0.792, 0.822, 1.097] -> average = (1.310+0.792+0.822+1.097)/4 = 4.021/4 = 1.00525\n      ... and so on.\n\n 8. We compute the 24 averages. Then we repeat this same 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 9. The dates: \n        Start: 2017-04-19 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-04-18 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-04-19 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n 10. We must output 96 lines.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 average values (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat that list 4 times? Actually, we are going to use the same pattern for 4 consecutive days.\n\n   But note: the pattern is for a day. So we create a list `avg_hourly` of length 24.\n\n   Then the forecast for day5 (2017-04-19) is `avg_hourly[0]` at 00:00, `avg_hourly[1]` at 01:00, ... `avg_hourly[23]` at 23:00.\n        day6: same `avg_hourly[0]` at 00:00, ... and so on.\n\n 11. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have weekly data. So we assume the pattern is the same for the next 4 days.\n\n 12. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n      We'll index the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and then for each hour, we take the 4 values we have.\n\n      Hour 0 (00:00): [1.371, 0.761, 0.822, 0.975] -> (1.371+0.761+0.822+0.975)/4 = 3.929/4 = 0.98225\n      Hour 1 (01:00): [1.310, 0.792, 0.822, 1.097] -> (1.310+0.792+0.822+1.097)=4.021 -> 4.021/4=1.00525\n      Hour 2 (02:00): [1.249,0.822,0.853,0.944] -> (1.249+0.822+0.853+0.944)=3.868 -> 3.868/4=0.967\n      Hour 3 (03:00): [1.340,0.944,0.822,0.853] -> (1.340+0.944+0.822+0.853)=3.959 -> 3.959/4=0.98975\n      Hour 4 (04:00): [1.066,0.975,0.914,0.701] -> (1.066+0.975+0.914+0.701)=3.656 -> 3.656/4=0.914\n      Hour 5 (05:00): [0.822,1.097,1.036,0.883] -> (0.822+1.097+1.036+0.883)=3.838 -> 3.838/4=0.9595\n      Hour 6 (06:00): [0.975,1.097,1.218,1.005] -> (0.975+1.097+1.218+1.005)=4.295 -> 4.295/4=1.07375\n      Hour 7 (07:00): [1.097,1.249,1.097,1.005] -> (1.097+1.249+1.097+1.005)=4.448 -> 4.448/4=1.112\n      Hour 8 (08:00): [1.432,1.279,1.340,1.249] -> (1.432+1.279+1.340+1.249)=5.3 -> 5.3/4=1.325\n      Hour 9 (09:00): [1.249,1.218,1.401,1.097] -> (1.249+1.218+1.401+1.097)=4.965 -> 4.965/4=1.24125\n      Hour 10: [1.340,1.310,1.066,1.310] -> (1.340+1.310+1.066+1.310)=5.026 -> 5.026/4=1.2565\n      Hour 11: [1.188,1.340,1.036,1.127] -> (1.188+1.340+1.036+1.127)=4.691 -> 4.691/4=1.17275\n      Hour 12: [1.157,1.279,0.731,1.066] -> (1.157+1.279+0.731+1.066)=4.233 -> 4.233/4=1.05825\n      Hour 13: [1.218,1.157,0.883,1.218] -> (1.218+1.157+0.883+1.218)=4.476 -> 4.476/4=1.119\n      Hour 14: [1.340,0.914,0.975,1.310] -> (1.340+0.914+0.975+1.310)=4.539 -> 4.539/4=1.13475\n      Hour 15: [1.340,1.249,1.066,1.279] -> (1.340+1.249+1.066+1.279)=4.934 -> 4.934/4=1.2335\n      Hour 16: [1.249,1.005,1.097,1.310] -> (1.249+1.005+1.097+1.310)=4.661 -> 4.661/4=1.16525\n      Hour 17: [1.157,0.975,1.157,1.127] -> (1.157+0.975+1.157+1.127)=4.416 -> 4.416/4=1.104\n      Hour 18: [1.157,0.853,1.036,0.853] -> (1.157+0.853+1.036+0.853)=3.899 -> 3.899/4=0.97475\n      Hour 19: [0.914,0.761,0.944,0.792] -> (0.914+0.761+0.944+0.792)=3.411 -> 3.411/4=0.85275\n      Hour 20: [0.731,0.822,1.127,0.853] -> (0.731+0.822+1.127+0.853)=3.533 -> 3.533/4=0.88325\n      Hour 21: [0.883,0.731,1.036,0.822] -> (0.883+0.731+1.036+0.822)=3.472 -> 3.472/4=0.868\n      Hour 22: [0.853,0.792,0.944,0.853] -> (0.853+0.792+0.944+0.853)=3.442 -> 3.442/4=0.8605\n      Hour 23: [0.853,0.883,0.975,0.944] -> (0.853+0.883+0.975+0.944)=3.655 -> 3.655/4=0.91375\n\n 13.

Now, we write the 4 days:\n\n      Day1: 2017-04-19: [0.982, 1.005, 0.967, 0.990, 0.914, 0.960, 1.074, 1.112, 1.325, 1.241, 1.257, 1.173, 1.058, 1.119, 1.135, 1.234, 1.165, 1.104, 0.975, 0.853, 0.883, 0.868, 0.861, 0.914]\n      Day2: 2017-04-20: same 24 numbers\n      Day3: 2017-04-21: same\n      Day4: 2017-04-22: same\n\n 21. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-04-19 00:00:00, then 2017-04-19 01:00:00, ... 2017-04-19 23:00:00\n      Then 2017-04-20 00:00:00 ... 2017-04-20 23:00:00\n      Then 2017-04-21 00:00:00 ... 2017-04-21 23:00:00\n      Then 2017-04-22 00:00:00 ... 2017-04-22 23:00:00\n\n 22. We output 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n   We have a list of 24 values: \n        hourly_avg = [0.982, 1.005, 0.967, 0.990, 0.914, 0.960, 1.074, 1.112, 1.325, 1.241, 1.257, 1.173, \n                      1.058, 1.119, 1.135, 1.234, 1.165, 1.104, 0.975, 0.853, 0.883, 0.868, 0.861, 0.914]\n\n   Then for day in [19,20,21,22]:\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = f\"2017-04-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n 23. But note: the day must be two digits: 19,20,21,22 -> so we can write as strings.\n\n 24. We write:\n\n        for day in ['19','20','21','22']:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                hour_str = f\"{hour:02d}\"\n                date_str = f\"2017-04-{day} {hour_str}:00:00\"\n                value = hourly_avg[hour]\n                print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")\n\n 25. However, we must output exactly as the input: the date string and then the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. But note: the input had the value as a float with 3 decimal places. We are rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n 27. We output in the markdown code block.\n\n 28. Let's write the answer accordingly.\n\n 29. Important: We must not omit any content. So we output 96 lines.\n\n 30. We note: the last provided date was 2017-04-18 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-04-19 00:00:00.\n\n 31. We are ready.\n",
