        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with periods of high and low values.\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data, but in the given sample, there are 96 consecutive records without missing values? \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But the provided data does not have any missing values? \n    Since the problem says to be aware of missing values, we should check the provided data for missingness. \n    Looking at the data: \n        - The dates are consecutive hourly from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00 (exactly 4 days * 24 = 96 points). \n        - There are no missing time stamps in the provided data? But the problem says the data will have missing values. \n    However, the provided data in the example does not show any missing values. \n\n    Since the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and the data provided is complete, we assume that the given 96 points are without missing values? \n    But the forecasting must account for the possibility of patterns that might be affected by missing values in the future? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n    This might mean that the provided historical data might have missing values? But in the example, we don't see any. \n\n    Let me re-read: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then the data. The data provided has 96 rows. \n\n    However, to be safe, we should check for missing timestamps in the provided data. \n\n    The data starts at 2017-06-22 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-06-25 23:00:00. \n    The frequency is hourly. We have 4*24 = 96 points. The data provided has 96 rows. So no missing in the provided history.\n\n 3. For forecasting, we can use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since the data is hourly and we see a daily pattern (period=24), \n    we can use a seasonal model. \n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) \n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) \n    - Or a simple seasonal naive model? \n\n 5. However, note that the data has multiple seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality (which would require 7*24=168 points per week). \n    So we stick to daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 6. We can use a SARIMA model. We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). \n\n 7. Steps for modeling:\n    a. Check stationarity: if not stationary, we may need to difference (d and D).\n    b. Identify AR and MA terms.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an automated approach to select the best SARIMA model by grid search, but with only 96 points, we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we can use a simpler model: \n    - We can use a seasonal naive model: the forecast for each hour in the next day is the value of the same hour in the last day? \n      But we have 4 days of history. We could take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n\n    However, the pattern might change. \n\n 10. Another idea: use the last day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be 24 hours, and we need 96 (4 days). \n     We could repeat the last day 4 times? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 11. We can use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). The statsmodels library has an implementation. \n\n 12. However, note that we are not actually running code, but we are to provide the forecast. \n\n 13. Since the problem is to be solved without code, we must use a heuristic.\n\n 14. Observing the data: \n     - The HULL values show a daily pattern: \n         * Low during the night (around 0 to 2) \n         * Higher during the day (peaking around 4-5 in the afternoon? but note: \n           On 2017-06-22: peak at 11:00 (5.224) and then a drop at 12:00 (2.478) and then again a peak at 13:00 (4.153) and then a drop? \n         * The pattern is not very consistent. \n\n     Let's look at the same hour across days:\n\n        Hour 0: \n          2017-06-22: 2.411\n          2017-06-23: 1.340\n          2017-06-24: 1.674\n          2017-06-25: 4.019\n\n        Hour 1:\n          2017-06-22: 2.344\n          2017-06-23: 1.072\n          2017-06-24: 1.608\n          2017-06-25: 3.416\n\n     There is a clear upward trend in the night hours from day 4? \n\n 15. Given the complexity and without a clear consistent pattern, and the fact that we are to forecast 4 days, we can use a moving average method with seasonality.\n\n 16. We can compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each day in the next 4 days? \n\n     But note: the last day (2017-06-25) has higher values at night? \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most recent day has more weight? \n\n 18. Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide the forecast, we choose a simple method: \n     We will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the same hour in the next 4 days. \n\n     For example, for hour 0: \n        (2.411 + 1.340 + 1.674 + 4.019) / 4 = 2.361\n     Then for the next 4 days, at hour 0 we will have 2.361.\n\n     But note: the last day (2017-06-25) has a much higher value at hour 0 (4.019). This might indicate an increasing trend? \n\n 19. We can also consider a linear trend? \n\n 20. Given the ambiguity, and the fact that we must provide 96 values, we decide to use the average by hour. \n\n 21. Steps:\n     - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n     - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 22. However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. \n\n 23. Let's calculate the mean for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (2.411 + 1.340 + 1.674 + 4.019) / 4 = 2.361\n        hour1: (2.344 + 1.072 + 1.608 + 3.416) / 4 = 2.110\n        hour2: (1.674 + 1.608 + 1.541 + 3.014) / 4 = 1.95925\n        hour3: (2.478 + 0.871 + 1.875 + 4.689) / 4 = 2.47825\n        hour4: (2.277 + 0.804 + 2.277 + 3.081) / 4 = 2.10975\n        hour5: (we have: 2.344, 1.474, 2.076, 2.746) -> (2.344+1.474+2.076+2.746)/4 = 2.160\n        hour6: (2.143, 1.474, 0.871, 3.081) -> (2.143+1.474+0.871+3.081)/4 = 1.89225\n        hour7: (2.009, 1.741, 1.474, 4.287) -> (2.009+1.741+1.474+4.287)/4 = 2.37775\n        hour8: (3.684, 2.143, 3.148, 2.947) -> (3.684+2.143+3.148+2.947)/4 = 2.9805\n        hour9: (4.555, 1.541, 3.014, 1.340) -> (4.555+1.541+3.014+1.340)/4 = 2.6125\n        hour10: (4.890, 1.072, 5.023, 1.808) -> (4.890+1.072+5.023+1.808)/4 = 3.19825\n        hour11: (5.224, 1.741, 4.019, 1.273) -> (5.224+1.741+4.019+1.273)/4 = 3.06425\n        hour12: (2.478, 0.067, 1.942, 1.206) -> (2.478+0.067+1.942+1.206)/4 = 1.42325\n        hour13: (4.153, 1.541, 2.411, 0.268) -> (4.153+1.541+2.411+0.268)/4 = 2.09325\n        hour14: (3.282, 1.741, 1.674, 1.072) -> (3.282+1.741+1.674+1.072)/4 = 1.94225\n        hour15: (2.478, 2.880, 3.416, 1.474) -> (2.478+2.880+3.416+1.474)/4 = 2.562\n        hour16: (1.474, 1.072, 1.541, 1.072) -> (1.474+1.072+1.541+1.072)/4 = 1.28975\n        hour17: (1.139, 0.670, 1.474, 1.072) -> (1.139+0.670+1.474+1.072)/4 = 1.08875\n        hour18: (0.536, -0.469, 1.273, 0.335) -> (0.536 -0.469 + 1.273 + 0.335)/4 = 0.41875\n        hour19: (0.335, -0.469, 1.005, 0.201) -> (0.335 -0.469 + 1.005 + 0.201)/4 = 0.268\n        hour20: (0.134, -0.402, 1.273, 0.335) -> (0.134 -0.402 + 1.273 + 0.335)/4 = 0.335\n        hour21: (-0.201, -0.469, 1.072, 0.536) -> (-0.201 -0.469 + 1.072 + 0.536)/4 = 0.2345\n        hour22: (0.268, 0.268, 1.407, 0.737) -> (0.268+0.268+1.407+0.737)/4 = 0.670\n        hour23: (1.273, 1.005, 1.942, 1.072) -> (1.273+1.005+1.942+1.072)/4 = 1.323\n\n 24. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 to 2017-06-29 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-06-26): \n            00:00:00 -> 2.361\n            01:00:00 -> 2.110\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 1.323\n\n        Day 2 (2017-06-27): same as above\n        Day 3 (2017-06-28): same as above\n        Day 4 (2017-06-29): same as above\n\n 25. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are forecasting without gaps? \n     We are to provide the next 96 recorded dates. We assume the next 96 are consecutive hours.\n\n 26. We generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-26 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-06-25 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-06-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-29 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We'll create a list of 96 values by repeating the 24 mean values 4 times.\n\n 28. However, note that the mean values we calculated are for hour0 to hour23. We will use:\n\n        hour0: 2.361\n        hour1: 2.110\n        hour2: 1.95925 -> rounded to 1.959\n        ... \n\n     But the original data has 3 decimal places. We'll keep 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Let's recalculate and round to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: (2.411+1.340+1.674+4.019)/4 = 9.444/4 = 2.361\n        hour1: (2.344+1.072+1.608+3.416)/4 = 8.44/4 = 2.110\n        hour2: (1.674+1.608+1.541+3.014)/4 = 7.837/4 = 1.95925 -> 1.959\n        hour3: (2.478+0.871+1.875+4.689)/4 = 9.913/4 = 2.47825 -> 2.478\n        hour4: (2.277+0.804+2.277+3.081)/4 = 8.439/4 = 2.10975 -> 2.110\n        hour5: (2.344+1.474+2.076+2.746)/4 = 8.64/4 = 2.160\n        hour6: (2.143+1.474+0.871+3.081)/4 = 7.569/4 = 1.89225 -> 1.892\n        hour7: (2.009+1.741+1.474+4.287)/4 = 9.511/4 = 2.37775 -> 2.378\n        hour8: (3.684+2.143+3.148+2.947)/4 = 11.922/4 = 2.9805 -> 2.981\n        hour9: (4.555+1.541+3.014+1.340)/4 = 10.45/4 = 2.6125 -> 2.613\n        hour10: (4.890+1.072+5.023+1.808)/4 = 12.793/4 = 3.19825 -> 3.198\n        hour11: (5.224+1.741+4.019+1.273)/4 = 12.257/4 = 3.06425 -> 3.064\n        hour12: (2.478+0.067+1.942+1.206)/4 = 5.693/4 = 1.42325 -> 1.423\n        hour13: (4.153+1.541+2.411+0.268)/4 = 8.373/4 = 2.09325 -> 2.093\n        hour14: (3.282+1.741+1.674+1.072)/4 = 7.769/4 = 1.94225 -> 1.942\n        hour15: (2.478+2.880+3.416+1.474)/4 = 10.248/4 = 2.562\n        hour16: (1.474+1.072+1.541+1.072)/4 = 5.159/4 = 1.28975 -> 1.290\n        hour17: (1.139+0.670+1.474+1.072)/4 = 4.355/4 = 1.08875 -> 1.089\n        hour18: (0.536-0.469+1.273+0.335)/4 = (0.536-0.469=0.067; 0.067+1.273=1.34; 1.34+0.335=1.675) -> 1.675/4 = 0.41875 -> 0.419\n        hour19: (0.335-0.469+1.005+0.201)/4 = (0.335-0.469=-0.134; -0.134+1.005=0.871; 0.871+0.201=1.072) -> 1.072/4 = 0.268\n        hour20: (0.134-0.402+1.273+0.335)/4 = (0.134-0.402=-0.268; -0.268+1.273=1.005; 1.005+0.335=1.34) -> 1.34/4 = 0.335\n        hour21: (-0.201-0.469+1.072+0.536)/4 = (-0.201-0.469=-0.67; -0.67+1.072=0.402; 0.402+0.536=0.938) -> 0.938/4 = 0.2345 -> 0.234\n        hour22: (0.268+0.268+1.407+0.737)/4 = 2.68/4 = 0.670\n        hour23: (1.273+1.005+1.942+1.072)/4 = 5.292/4 = 1.323\n\n 30.
