        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-29 00:00:00 to 2017-06-01 23:00:00). We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-06-02 00:00:00 to 2017-06-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? We note that in the provided data, there is a stretch of constant values (0.888) for an entire day (2017-05-31) and also a zero (0.000) on 2017-05-30 11:00:00. We must handle missing values appropriately. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any explicit missing (like NaN) but we see zeros and constant values that might be indicative of missing data? But the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning in the provided data there might be missing values. However, looking at the data, it seems complete (no gaps in the zero and constant values might be real). So we will treat the provided data as is.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series model. Given the hourly data and the pattern (which seems to have daily seasonality), we can use a model that accounts for seasonality.\n\n 3. Since the data is at hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days), we can assume a daily seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n 4. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, the data is short (only 4 days) so we must be cautious.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple method like:\n    - Using the average of the same hour in the past days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 6. But note: the data on 2017-05-31 is constant (0.888 for all hours). This might be an anomaly or a holiday? We should consider that the next days might not be holidays.\n\n 7. We can try to use the last day (2017-06-01) as a base and adjust with the average pattern? But that might not be robust.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the short history, we can use a simple seasonal naive model: using the same day of the previous cycle? But we have only one full cycle (4 days) and the last day (2017-06-01) is the most recent.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days for each hour. Since we have 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the data on 2017-05-31 is constant and might be an outlier. We might want to use the median or mean without that day?\n\n 10. However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 dates. We must generate 96 points.\n\n 11. Approach:\n     - We note that the data has a daily seasonality. We can decompose the series and then forecast the seasonal component.\n     - But with only 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour across the 4 days? But the constant day (2017-05-31) will pull the average down. Alternatively, we can use the median for each hour to avoid the effect of the constant day.\n\n 12. Let's check the data for each hour:\n\n     For example, hour 00:00:\n        2017-05-29: 1.919\n        2017-05-30: 1.848\n        2017-05-31: 0.888\n        2017-06-01: 1.457\n\n     The median for 00:00: sort [0.888, 1.457, 1.848, 1.919] -> median = (1.457+1.848)/2 = 1.6525? Actually, for even number of points, we take the average of the two middle ones. But 4 points: the two middle are 1.457 and 1.848 -> 1.6525.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the mean: (1.919+1.848+0.888+1.457)/4 = 1.528.\n\n     But note: the constant day (2017-05-31) is likely an anomaly. We might exclude it? But the problem doesn't specify. Since we are not told about holidays, we might include all.\n\n 13. However, the next 4 days (from 2017-06-02 to 2017-06-05) are weekdays? 2017-05-29 was a Monday (checking: 2017-05-29 is Monday). Then 2017-05-30 Tuesday, 2017-05-31 Wednesday, 2017-06-01 Thursday. The next 4 days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? So we have a weekend.\n\n 14. This complicates because the pattern might change on weekends. But we don't have weekend data in the history? The history only has Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. The next days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. We don't have Friday, Saturday, Sunday in the history.\n\n 15. Given the challenge, we might have to use the available data and assume the pattern for Friday is similar to Monday? and Saturday and Sunday might be different? But we don't have data.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the entire history to compute the average for each hour and use that for every day? But that would ignore the weekly pattern? We don't have enough data for weekly pattern.\n\n 17. Considering the constraints, we decide to use the median for each hour of the day over the available 4 days. The median is robust to the constant day.\n\n 18. Steps for forecasting:\n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the median of that hour across the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the 24-hour median pattern 4 times.\n\n 19. Why median? Because on 2017-05-31 we have a constant value which is an outlier for most hours, and the median will be less affected.\n\n 20. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00: [1.919, 1.848, 0.888, 1.457] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.457, 1.848, 1.919] -> median = (1.457+1.848)/2 = 1.6525\n     Hour 01: [2.878, 1.706, 0.888, 1.670] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.670, 1.706, 2.878] -> median = (1.670+1.706)/2 = 1.688\n     Hour 02: [1.990, 1.919, 0.888, 1.635] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.635, 1.919, 1.990] -> median = (1.635+1.919)/2 = 1.777\n     Hour 03: [2.949, 0.782, 0.888, 2.381] -> sorted: [0.782, 0.888, 2.381, 2.949] -> median = (0.888+2.381)/2 = 1.6345\n     Hour 04: [2.025, 1.812, 0.888, 2.132] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.812, 2.025, 2.132] -> median = (1.812+2.025)/2 = 1.9185\n     Hour 05: [1.919, 1.670, 0.888, 2.345] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.670, 1.919, 2.345] -> median = (1.670+1.919)/2 = 1.7945\n     Hour 06: [2.416, 1.599, 0.888, 1.386] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.386, 1.599, 2.416] -> median = (1.386+1.599)/2 = 1.4925\n     Hour 07: [2.203, 1.706, 0.888, 2.168] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.706, 2.168, 2.203] -> median = (1.706+2.168)/2 = 1.937\n     Hour 08: [2.594, 1.528, 0.888, 1.528] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.528, 1.528, 2.594] -> median = (1.528+1.528)/2 = 1.528\n     Hour 09: [2.665, 1.528, 0.888, 1.386] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.386, 1.528, 2.665] -> median = (1.386+1.528)/2 = 1.457\n     Hour 10: [2.097, 1.279, 0.888, 1.386] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.279, 1.386, 2.097] -> median = (1.279+1.386)/2 = 1.3325\n     Hour 11: [2.630, 0.000, 0.888, 1.706] -> sorted: [0.000, 0.888, 1.706, 2.630] -> median = (0.888+1.706)/2 = 1.297\n     Hour 12: [1.954, 1.102, 0.888, 1.919] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.102, 1.919, 1.954] -> median = (1.102+1.919)/2 = 1.5105\n     Hour 13: [2.772, 0.817, 0.888, 0.817] -> sorted: [0.817, 0.817, 0.888, 2.772] -> median = (0.817+0.888)/2 = 0.8525\n     Hour 14: [2.559, 1.670, 0.888, 1.421] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.421, 1.670, 2.559] -> median = (1.421+1.670)/2 = 1.5455\n     Hour 15: [1.706, 1.031, 0.888, 1.102] -> sorted: [0.888, 1.031, 1.102, 1.706] -> median = (1.031+1.102)/2 = 1.0665\n     Hour 16: [1.528, 0.959, 0.888, 1.457] -> sorted: [0.888, 0.959, 1.457, 1.528] -> median = (0.959+1.457)/2 = 1.208\n     Hour 17: [0.426, 1.173, 0.888, 1.635] -> sorted: [0.426, 0.888, 1.173, 1.635] -> median = (0.888+1.173)/2 = 1.0305\n     Hour 18: [1.208, 0.746, 0.888, 1.350] -> sorted: [0.746, 0.888, 1.208, 1.350] -> median = (0.888+1.208)/2 = 1.048\n     Hour 19: [1.066, 0.711, 0.888, 1.208] -> sorted: [0.711, 0.888, 1.066, 1.208] -> median = (0.888+1.066)/2 = 0.977\n     Hour 20: [0.817, 0.640, 0.888, 0.924] -> sorted: [0.640, 0.817, 0.888, 0.924] -> median = (0.817+0.888)/2 = 0.8525\n     Hour 21: [1.031, 0.107, 0.888, 1.102] -> sorted: [0.107, 0.888, 1.031, 1.102] -> median = (0.888+1.031)/2 = 0.9595\n     Hour 22: [0.533, 0.711, 0.888, 0.320] -> sorted: [0.320, 0.533, 0.711, 0.888] -> median = (0.533+0.711)/2 = 0.622\n     Hour 23: [1.244, 1.031, 0.888, 0.711] -> sorted: [0.711, 0.888, 1.031, 1.244] -> median = (0.888+1.031)/2 = 0.9595\n\n 21. Now, we have 24 median values. We will use these 24 values and repeat them 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n 22. The forecast will start at 2017-06-02 00:00:00 and end at 2017-06-05 23:00:00.\n\n 23. Format: We must output the complete data in the same format as the input, with the date and the MULL value.\n\n 24. We generate the dates: \n        Start: 2017-06-02 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 96 hours.\n\n 25. The values: \n        Hour 0: 1.6525 -> 2017-06-02 00:00:00\n        Hour 1: 1.688  -> 2017-06-02 01:00:00\n        ... \n        Hour 23: 0.9595 -> 2017-06-02 23:00:00\n        Then repeat for the next day: \n        Hour 0: 1.6525 -> 2017-06-03 00:00:00\n        ... until 2017-06-05 23:00:00.\n\n 26. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 27. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided data, we don't have missing in the sense of NaN, but we have zeros and constant. We are generating without missing.\n\n 28. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-06-02 00:00:00 1.653\n2017-06-02 01:00:00 1.688\n...\n2017-06-05 23:00:00 0.960\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 29. Let's write the 24 medians (rounded to 3 decimals) for one day:\n\n        hour00: 1.6525 -> 1.653\n        hour01: 1.688 -> 1.688\n        hour02: 1.777 -> 1.777\n        hour03: 1.6345 -> 1.635\n        hour04: 1.9185 -> 1.919\n        hour05: 1.7945 -> 1.794\n        hour06: 1.4925 -> 1.493\n        hour07: 1.937 -> 1.937\n        hour08: 1.528 -> 1.528\n        hour09: 1.457 -> 1.457\n        hour10: 1.3325 -> 1.333\n        hour11: 1.297 -> 1.297\n        hour12: 1.5105 -> 1.511\n        hour13: 0.8525 -> 0.853\n        hour14: 1.5455 -> 1.546\n        hour15: 1.0665 -> 1.067\n        hour16: 1.208 -> 1.208\n        hour17: 1.0305 -> 1.031\n        hour18: 1.048 -> 1.048\n        hour19: 0.977 -> 0.977\n        hour20: 0.8525 -> 0.853\n        hour21: 0.9595 -> 0.960\n        hour22: 0.622 -> 0.622\n        hour23: 0.9595 -> 0.960\n\n 30. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-06-02\n        Day2: 2017-06-03\n        Day3: 2017-06-04\n        Day4: 2017-06-05\n\n 31. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 32. Note: We are not using any sophisticated model because of the very short history and the presence of an anomaly. This median approach is simple and robust.\n\n 33. Let's generate the data.\n",
