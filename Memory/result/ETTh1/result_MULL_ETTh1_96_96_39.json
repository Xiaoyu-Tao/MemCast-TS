        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hours of data (from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00). However, note that after 2016-12-05 00:00:00, the data becomes zero and stays zero for the rest of the period. This might indicate a problem (like the transformer being offline) or missing data. But the user has warned that there are missing values.\n\n However, the task is to forecast the next 96 recorded dates (which are also hourly, so 96 hours). Since the data has a long stretch of zeros, we must be cautious.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a pattern for the first day (2016-12-04) and then becomes zero from 2016-12-05 07:00:00 onwards (with a few non-zero values at the beginning of 2016-12-05). But then from 2016-12-05 07:00:00 to the end of the given data (2016-12-07 23:00:00) it is zero.\n\n 2. The problem: We are to forecast the next 96 hours (so from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00).\n\n 3. Given the abrupt change to zero, we must consider:\n    - The zeros might be due to missing data (so we should impute) or due to a shutdown. But the user says there are missing values.\n\n 4. However, the instruction says: \"forecast the data for next 96 recorded dates\". We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 timestamps.\n\n 5. Since the last part of the given data is zeros, and we are to forecast, we have to decide on an approach.\n\n 6. Possible approaches:\n    a) If we consider the zeros as valid, then we might forecast zeros for the next 96 hours? But that seems unlikely because the transformer was active on the first day.\n\n    b) Alternatively, we might treat the zeros as missing and impute them. But the user says the data has missing values, so we should impute the missing values in the given data first? However, the task is to forecast the next 96, not to impute the past.\n\n    c) The user has provided 96 records (from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00). We are to forecast the next 96 (so 96 hours after the last point).\n\n 7. Clarification: The data provided has 96 points? Let's count:\n      Dec 4: 24 hours\n      Dec 5: 24 hours\n      Dec 6: 24 hours\n      Dec 7: 24 hours\n      Total: 96 hours. So we have 96 records.\n\n 8. The last 68 records (from 2016-12-05 07:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00) are zeros. The first 28 records (from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-05 06:00:00) have non-zero and zero values.\n\n 9. How to handle the zeros? The zeros might be due to a fault or maintenance. But without more context, we have to make an assumption.\n\n 10. Since the user says \"these data will have missing values\", we can assume that the zeros from 2016-12-05 07:00:00 onwards are missing? But note: the zeros on 2016-12-05 from 07:00:00 to 23:00:00 and then the entire next two days? That seems like a long period of missing data.\n\n 11. However, the task is to forecast the next 96 hours, not to impute the past. So we are only required to produce the next 96 hours.\n\n 12. We must use a model that can handle the given data. Given the abrupt drop to zero, it is challenging.\n\n 13. Considering the problem, we might:\n     - Use the data from the first day (which is complete) to model the daily pattern, and then forecast the next days by repeating that pattern? But note the zeros in the following days break the pattern.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we might treat the entire series as having missing values and use an imputation method to fill the zeros? But the user did not ask to impute the past, only to forecast the future.\n\n 15. Since the user says \"be aware of that\" (missing values) and we are to forecast the next 96, we have two options:\n     Option 1: Impute the missing values in the given data and then forecast.\n     Option 2: Forecast directly without imputing the past, but then the model might be affected by the zeros.\n\n 16. Given the time is limited and we must provide an answer, we choose a practical approach:\n\n     Step 1: We note that the zeros might be an anomaly. We will use only the first day (24 hours) as a typical day? But the next day (2016-12-05) has non-zero for the first 7 hours? Actually, from 00:00 to 06:00 on 2016-12-05 there are non-zero values, then zeros.\n\n     Step 2: We can assume that the zeros are missing and we should impute them with the pattern of the first day? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 17. Considering the above, and the fact that we are to forecast the next 96 hours (which are 4 days), we can do:\n\n     - Use the first day (2016-12-04) as a template for a daily pattern. But note: the first day is a Sunday? (2016-12-04 is a Sunday). We don't have information about the day of the week.\n\n 18. However, the data after the first day is mostly zeros. So we might assume that the transformer was down and then came back? But we don't know.\n\n 19. Given the ambiguity, a safe approach is to use a simple forecasting method that is robust to missing data.\n\n     We can use:\n        - Last observation carried forward? But the last non-zero value is at 2016-12-05 06:00:00 (which is 1.599). Then we have zeros. So if we carry forward, we would use 1.599? But that doesn't make sense for the entire next 96 hours.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the average of the first day? But the pattern is not flat.\n\n 20. Another idea: use the average of each hour of the day from the available non-zero data. We have:\n        - Only one complete day: 2016-12-04 (Sunday)\n        - And the partial day: 2016-12-05 (Monday) from 00:00 to 06:00.\n\n     We can compute the hourly average for the available data for each hour. But we have only one full day and a partial.\n\n 21. Since the zeros are likely missing, we can ignore them for the purpose of computing the hourly pattern? Then we have:\n        Hour 0: 3.767 (from Dec4) and 1.741 (from Dec5) -> average = (3.767+1.741)/2 = 2.754\n        Hour 1: 3.838 and 2.061 -> (3.838+2.061)/2 = 2.9495\n        ... and so on.\n\n     But note: the data for Dec5 only goes until hour 6.\n\n 22. For hours 7 to 23, we only have the Dec4 data? So we use that.\n\n 23. Then we can forecast the next 96 hours by repeating this hourly pattern for the next 4 days? But note: the pattern might change by day of week? We don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 24. Steps for the next 96 hours (starting from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00) would be:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-12-08 (Thursday? We don't know the day of week for the future, but we can compute: 2016-12-04 is Sunday, so 2016-12-08 is Thursday)\n        Day 2: Friday\n        Day 3: Saturday\n        Day 4: Sunday\n\n     But we only have one Sunday (2016-12-04) and a partial Monday (2016-12-05). We don't have data for Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n 25. Given the lack of data, we will use the same pattern for every day? We'll use the average hourly profile we built (using the available non-zero data).\n\n 26. How to build the average hourly profile:\n\n        For hour 0: average of the two values we have (Dec4 and Dec5 at 00:00) -> (3.767 + 1.741)/2 = 2.754\n        For hour 1: (3.838 + 2.061)/2 = 2.9495\n        For hour 2: (3.553 + 2.168)/2 = 2.8605\n        For hour 3: (2.630 + 2.168)/2 = 2.399\n        For hour 4: (3.553 + 2.203)/2 = 2.878\n        For hour 5: (3.411 + 1.244)/2 = 2.3275\n        For hour 6: (2.807 + 1.599)/2 = 2.203\n        For hour 7: we only have Dec4: 2.878 -> but note Dec5 at 07:00 is 0, but we are ignoring zeros? Actually, we are only using non-zero? But the Dec5 at 07:00 is -0.071? Wait, the data for Dec5 at 07:00 is -0.071. But then from 08:00 to 23:00 on Dec5 and the next days are zeros. We don't have non-zero for hour 7 on any other day? So we have to use the Dec4 value? But that might be unreliable.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can use the Dec4 data for hours 7 to 23? But that is only one day.\n\n 28. Considering the above, and the fact that the zeros might be missing, we can impute the missing hours in the given data? But the user did not ask for that.\n\n 29. Since the task is to forecast the future, and we have to provide an answer, we decide:\n\n     We will create an average hourly pattern using the non-zero data for each hour. For hours that have at least one non-zero, we use the average of the non-zero values. For hours that have no non-zero (which doesn't happen in our data because we have Dec4 for all hours) we use the Dec4 value.\n\n     Specifically:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23):\n          values = [ value at hour h on any day that is non-zero and within the non-zero period ]\n\n        In our data, for each hour h from 0 to 6, we have two days (Dec4 and Dec5). For hours 7 to 23, we have only Dec4 (because Dec5 and beyond are zeros, which we are treating as missing and hence we ignore them for averaging?).\n\n        But note: the zeros might be valid? The user says \"missing values\", so we assume zeros are missing? But the zeros are recorded as 0.0, and also there is a negative value (-0.071) at 2016-12-05 07:00:00. So we cannot assume that zeros are missing? They might be actual measurements.\n\n 30. This is ambiguous. Given the instructions, we must forecast. We note that the data after 2016-12-05 07:00:00 is consistently zero. This might indicate that the transformer was turned off. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours might be zero? But that seems counter to the first day.\n\n 31. However, the problem says \"Middle UseLess Load\", which might be a specific metric. It could be that the load dropped to zero because of a failure? But we are not told.\n\n 32. Given the ambiguity, we choose a conservative approach: we will forecast zeros for the next 96 hours? But that would be 4 days of zeros, which is what we have in the last part of the data.\n\n 33. But the user might expect a more sophisticated approach.\n\n 34. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model that can handle the abrupt change? But with only 96 points and 68 of them zero, the model will forecast near zero.\n\n 35. We decide to use a simple method: since the last 68 points are zero, we forecast zero for the next 96.\n\n 36. However, note that the first 28 points are non-zero. But the last observed non-zero was 4 days ago? Actually, the last non-zero was at 2016-12-05 06:00:00 (which is 1.599). Then we have 68 zeros until 2016-12-07 23:00:00. Then we are to forecast 96 more hours? That would be 164 hours of zeros? That seems like the transformer is dead.\n\n 37. But the problem says \"missing values\", so we should not interpret zeros as actual zeros? We should impute them? The user did not ask to impute the past, but if we are to forecast, we need to use the available non-missing data.\n\n 38. We are in a dilemma.\n\n 39. Let's re-read the user: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" -> meaning the provided data has missing values. So the zeros might be missing? Or the zeros are valid? The user does not specify.\n\n 40. We must make an assumption: we assume that the zeros are missing values and should be imputed. Then we impute the missing values in the given data and then forecast.\n\n     How to impute? We can use linear interpolation? But note: the drop to zero is abrupt and then stays zero. Linear interpolation would not be appropriate.\n\n 41. Alternatively, we can use the last non-zero value? But that would carry forward the last non-zero (1.599) for the entire period? That doesn't match the daily pattern.\n\n 42. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the previous day? But the previous day (Dec4) at hour 7 was 2.878, then at hour 8 was 2.914, etc. But we have a gap of two days? We don't have data for Dec6 and Dec7.\n\n 43. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast, we decide to impute the missing values (the zeros) by the corresponding hour of the last available full day (which is Dec4). But note: the zeros start on Dec5 at 07:00:00. So:\n\n        For Dec5 at 07:00:00: we use the value from Dec4 at 07:00:00 (which is 2.878)\n        For Dec5 at 08:00:00: 2.914 (from Dec4)\n        ... until Dec5 23:00:00: 1.492 (from Dec4)\n\n        For Dec6 and Dec7: we repeat the same pattern? But that would be using Dec4 pattern for every day.\n\n 44. Then we have a complete data set for 96 hours (with imputed values). Then we can forecast the next 96 hours by using the same pattern? That is, we use the Dec4 pattern for Dec8, Dec9, Dec10, Dec11.\n\n 45. This is a naive approach: use the daily pattern from the last available full day and repeat it.\n\n 46. Steps:\n\n        Impute the given data for the zeros (from 2016-12-05 07:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00) by:\n            For any missing hour (where the value is zero and we consider it missing), we replace it with the value at the same hour on 2016-12-04.\n\n        Then we have a complete time series for 96 hours.\n\n        Then for forecasting the next 96 hours (which are 4 days), we use the same pattern from 2016-12-04 for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 47. But note: the next 96 hours start at 2016-12-08 00:00:00. We will use:\n\n        Hour 00:00: value from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 (3.767)\n        Hour 01:00: 3.838\n        ... and so on.\n\n        And repeat for 4 days.\n\n 48. However, the first day of the forecast (2016-12-08) is a Thursday, and we are using a Sunday pattern? But we have no data for other days, so we use the only pattern we have.\n\n 49. This is a simple and practical solution.\n\n 50. Let's do it.\n\n     Step 1: Impute the given data (though the user did not ask for it, but we need a complete history to forecast? Actually, we are only required to output the forecast, not the imputed history. So we can skip outputting the imputed history and only use it for modeling? But the forecast method we described does not require modeling, it's just repeating the pattern.\n\n     Step 2: For the next 96 hours, we will output:\n\n        Day1 (2016-12-08): the 24 values from 2016-12-04\n        Day2 (2016-12-09): the same 24 values\n        Day3 (2016-12-10): the same\n        Day4 (2016-12-11): the same\n\n 51. But note: the first day of the provided data (2016-12-04) is a Sunday, and the forecast starts on a Thursday? We are ignoring the day of week.\n\n 52. Given the lack of data, this is the best we can do.\n\n 53. Alternatively, we could use the available non-zero data to build an average day (as described in point 21 and 26) and use that average day for every day in the forecast. But we only have one full day and a partial. The average for the first 7 hours would be an average of two days, and the rest one day. That might be better? Let's do that.\n\n     Build an average day:\n\n        hour0: (3.767 + 1.741)/2 = 2.754\n        hour1: (3.838 + 2.061)/2 = 2.9495\n        hour2: (3.553 + 2.168)/2 = 2.8605\n        hour3: (2.630 + 2.168)/2 = 2.399\n        hour4: (3.553 + 2.203)/2 = 2.878\n        hour5: (3.411 + 1.244)/2 = 2.3275\n        hour6: (2.807 + 1.599)/2 = 2.203\n        hour7: only one non-zero: 2.878 (from Dec4) -> 2.878\n        hour8: 2.914\n        hour9: 1.777\n        hour10: 1.954\n        hour11: 1.492\n        hour12: 0.817\n        hour13: 1.954\n        hour14: 1.990\n        hour15: 2.381\n        hour16: 1.599\n        hour17: 1.244\n        hour18: 1.208\n        hour19: 0.995\n        hour20: 0.782\n        hour21: -0.071\n        hour22: 0.853\n        hour23: 1.492\n\n     Then for the forecast, we use this average day for each of the 4 days.\n\n 54. This average day is more robust than using only Dec4.\n\n 55. We choose this average day approach.\n\n 56. So the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        For each day in the forecast period, we output the 24 values of the average day.\n\n 57. Format: we must output exactly 96 rows, with the date and the forecasted MULL.\n\n 58. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-08 00:00:00\n        Then hourly until 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n\n 59. The average day values (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input):\n\n        hour0: 2.754\n        hour1: 2.950   (rounded from 2.9495)\n        hour2: 2.861   (rounded from 2.8605)\n        hour3: 2.399\n        hour4: 2.878\n        hour5: 2.328   (rounded from 2.3275)\n        hour6: 2.203\n        hour7: 2.878\n        hour8: 2.914\n        hour9: 1.777\n        hour10: 1.954\n        hour11: 1.492\n        hour12: 0.817\n        hour13: 1.954\n        hour14: 1.990\n        hour15: 2.381\n        hour16: 1.599\n        hour17: 1.244\n        hour18: 1.208\n        hour19: 0.995\n        hour20: 0.782\n        hour21: -0.071\n        hour22: 0.853\n        hour23: 1.492\n\n 60. Now, we output for 4 days:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-12-08: [2.754, 2.950, ... , 1.492]\n        Day 2: 2016-12-09: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2016-12-10: same\n        Day 4: 2016-12-11: same\n\n 61. We must output in the exact format.\n\n 62. Let's write the first few rows:\n\n        2016-12-08 00:00:00  2.754\n        2016-12-08 01:00:00  2.950\n        2016-12-08 02:00:00  2.861\n        2016-12-08 03:00:00  2.399\n        ... \n\n 63. We'll generate the numbers with 3 decimal places.\n\n 64. Note: the average for hour1: 2.9495 -> rounded to 3 decimals is 2.950? Yes.\n\n 65. Code for the average day:\n\n        h0 = round((3.767 + 1.741) / 2, 3)   # 2.754\n        h1 = round((3.838 + 2.061) / 2, 3)   # 2.9495 -> 2.950\n        h2 = round((3.553 + 2.168) / 2, 3)   # 2.8605 -> 2.861\n        h3 = round((2.630 + 2.168) / 2, 3)   # 2.399\n        h4 = round((3.553 + 2.203) / 2, 3)   # 2.878\n        h5 = round((3.411 + 1.244) / 2, 3)   # 2.3275 -> 2.328\n        h6 = round((2.807 + 1.599) / 2, 3)   # 2.203\n        h7 = 2.878   # from Dec4\n        h8 = 2.914\n        h9 = 1.777\n        h10 = 1.954\n        h11 = 1.492\n        h12 = 0.817\n        h13 = 1.954\n        h14 = 1.990\n        h15 = 2.381\n        h16 = 1.599\n        h17 = 1.244\n        h18 = 1.208\n        h19 = 0.995\n        h20 = 0.782\n        h21 = -0.071\n        h22 = 0.853\n        h23 = 1.492\n\n 66. Now, we create a list for one day: [h0, h1, h23]\n\n 67. Then repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 68. And generate the dates starting from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n\n 69.
