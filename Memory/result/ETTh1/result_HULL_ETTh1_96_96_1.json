        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 points. But we are told to be aware of missing values. However, in the given data, there are no missing values in the provided 96 points. So we can proceed.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon for this amount of data), we need a robust method.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal decomposition method or a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). However, the data is only 4 days, which is very short for a seasonal model with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24). Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we have to make a choice. We'll use a simple approach: \n    - We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust for any trend.\n\n 6. However, note that the data does not show a clear trend but does show daily seasonality. We can try:\n\n    Option A: Use the last day (2016-07-08) as a base and adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But we only have 4 days.\n\n    Option B: Use the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 7. But note: the last value of the last day (2016-07-08 23:00:00) is 8.841, which is an outlier compared to the rest of the day. We must be cautious.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the same pattern as the previous day for the next day. But we have 4 days, and we can see the pattern changes.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete set of 96 numbers, we decide to:\n\n    Step 1: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal components. But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n    Step 2: Instead, we can use the average of each hour across the 4 days to form a daily profile. Then, we can project that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, we note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the average per day:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-07-05): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: average\n        Day 3: average\n        Day 4: average\n\n    Then we can compute the daily trend and adjust the profile.\n\n 10. Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1: 5.626, 6.296, ... , 5.760 -> average = (let me calculate roughly) \n        Instead, we can do it in our code, but since we are generating the forecast manually, we need to compute.\n\n    However, we are not going to write code. We are to provide the forecast.\n\n 11. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide 96 numbers, we must choose a method that is simple and consistent.\n\n 12. We decide to use the following:\n\n     - We take the last day (2016-07-08) as the base for the next day (2016-07-09) because it is the most recent.\n     - Then for the subsequent days, we can use the same pattern but adjust by the average change from one day to the next? \n\n     But we have only 4 days, so we can compute the day-to-day change in the daily average and then project that.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a moving average to smooth the data and then forecast. But again, 4 days is too short.\n\n 14. Considering the above, we will:\n\n     a) Calculate the average for each day:\n\n        Day1 (05): \n          Sum = 5.626+6.296+6.296+5.425+5.626+4.689+5.425+5.224+5.961+6.028+5.961+6.430+5.425+4.555+5.358+5.224+5.023+5.425+4.957+4.689+4.622+4.689+4.354+5.760\n          = 124.789\n          Average = 124.789 / 24 = 5.1995\n\n        Day2 (06):\n          Sum = 5.090+5.425+5.358+5.157+4.488+5.559+4.488+6.162+6.363+4.756+4.890+4.957+4.756+5.291+5.023+4.220+4.086+4.756+4.287+3.550+4.153+2.880+3.349+4.689\n          = 110.254\n          Average = 110.254 / 24 = 4.5939\n\n        Day3 (07):\n          Sum = 5.157+6.229+6.229+6.363+5.090+5.626+5.760+5.961+5.090+5.559+6.095+4.957+3.617+4.555+3.818+3.684+3.416+4.220+4.287+4.086+4.153+3.282+3.885+5.358\n          = 112.137\n          Average = 112.137 / 24 = 4.6724\n\n        Day4 (08):\n          Sum = 4.756+4.756+5.224+4.555+4.086+5.224+5.425+4.086+4.555+4.019+4.756+4.220+4.086+3.416+5.023+4.220+3.550+4.086+3.885+3.617+4.086+4.354+5.358+8.841\n          = 101.184\n          Average = 101.184 / 24 = 4.216\n\n     b) The averages are: 5.1995, 4.5939, 4.6724, 4.216 -> showing a downward trend? But then day3 was a little higher than day2.\n\n     c) We can compute a linear trend on these 4 points? But that might be overfitting.\n\n 15. Given the volatility and the outlier on day4 (last hour: 8.841), we might consider using a median of the daily averages? \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n\n     For each hour in the next 96 hours (which are 4 days), we take the average of that same hour from the past 4 days. But then we have to adjust for the overall downward trend? \n\n     However, the data is very short and we don't have a clear trend. Also, the last day has an outlier at the last hour.\n\n 17. We decide to:\n\n     - Remove the outlier? But we are not allowed to alter the given data. We are only to forecast.\n\n     - Instead, we can use the median for each hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile. The median is robust to outliers.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        For hour 00:00: values [5.626, 5.090, 5.157, 4.756] -> sort: [4.756, 5.090, 5.157, 5.626] -> median = (5.090+5.157)/2 = 5.1235\n        Similarly for each hour.\n\n     Then we use this median profile for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 18. But note: the last value (23:00) on day4 is 8.841, which is an outlier. In the median for 23:00, we have:\n        [5.760, 4.689, 5.358, 8.841] -> sorted: [4.689, 5.358, 5.760, 8.841] -> median = (5.358+5.760)/2 = 5.559\n\n     So the median is robust.\n\n 19. Therefore, we will create a) a daily profile of 24 hours using the median of each hour over the 4 days.\n\n 20. Then, we will use that same profile for the next 4 days (96 hours). \n\n 21. However, we note that the overall level of the time series might be changing. We could adjust the profile by the last day's average? But we are using medians and the last day had a low average (4.216) and the median profile might have an average around (5.1995+4.5939+4.6724+4.216)/4 = 4.67045. \n\n     But the median profile we built is fixed. We can scale it? \n\n     Alternatively, we can use the median profile without scaling. \n\n 22. Since we are not sure about the level, and the data is short, we will use the median profile as is for the next 4 days.\n\n 23. Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n     - For each hour in the day (00:00 to 23:00), we compute the median of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (2016-07-09 to 2016-07-12), we assign the median value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 24. We must generate 96 values.\n\n 25.

We output the data in the same format: two columns, separated by space, with the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the value with 3 decimal places? The given data had 3 decimal places. But our medians are computed to 4 decimals. We can round to 3 decimals? \n\n     However, the original data had 3 decimal places. But note that the median calculation might be more precise. We can output with 3 decimals for consistency.\n\n     But the problem says: \"give me the complete data\", and the original data had 3 decimals. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 36. Rounding:\n\n        5.1235 -> 5.124\n        5.827 -> 5.827 (but we can represent as 5.827, which is the same as 5.8270 -> so 3 decimals: 5.827)\n        However, 5.1235 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal (5) -> round up: 5.124\n\n     We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 37. Let's round each median:\n\n        H00: 5.1235 -> 5.124\n        H01: 5.827 -> 5.827\n        H02: 5.7935 -> 5.794\n        because 5.7935: the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 3 becomes 4 -> 5.794\n        Similarly:\n\n        H03: 5.291 -> 5.291\n        H04: 4.789 -> 4.789\n        H05: 5.3915 -> 5.392\n        H06: 5.425 -> 5.425\n        H07: 5.5925 -> 5.593\n        H08: 5.5255 -> 5.526\n        H09: 5.1575 -> 5.158\n        H10: 5.4255 -> 5.426\n        H11: 4.957 -> 4.957\n        H12: 4.421 -> 4.421\n        H13: 4.555 -> 4.555\n        H14: 5.023 -> 5.023\n        H15: 4.220 -> 4.220\n        H16: 3.818 -> 3.818\n        H17: 4.488 -> 4.488\n        (but note: 4.488 is already 3 decimals? Actually, it's 4.488000 -> so 4.488)\n        H18: 4.287 -> 4.287\n        H19: 3.8515 -> 3.852\n        H20: 4.153 -> 4.153\n        H21: 3.818 -> 3.818\n        H22: 4.1195 -> 4.120\n        H23: 5.559 -> 5.559\n\n 38. Now, we write the forecast for 4 days.\n\n 39. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-07-09\n        Day2: 2016-07-10\n        Day3: 2016-07-11\n        Day4: 2016-07-12\n\n 40. We output 96 lines.\n\n 41. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n Note: We are aware that this is a simple method and might not capture trends or changes, but given the data size, it is a robust approach.\n\n Let's write the data.\n",
