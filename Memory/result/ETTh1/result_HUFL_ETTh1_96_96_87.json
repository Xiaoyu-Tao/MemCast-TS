        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for the purpose of forecasting, we must handle the given data and then produce 96 future points.\n\n 2. We are to use time series forecasting. Given the hourly data and the pattern (which seems to have daily seasonality), we can consider a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any)\n    - Seasonality (with period 24 hours)\n\n 3. Since we are to provide a complete set of 96 points without any missing values, we must ensure our forecast is for 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model or a more sophisticated one. Given the constraints and the fact that we are an expert, we might choose a model such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (last day) as the forecast for the next days? But note: the data shows variation from day to day.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data has a potential anomaly (like the very low values at noon on 2017-06-14, 2017-06-15, 2017-06-16, and 2017-06-17). \n    We must be cautious. But without more context, we proceed.\n\n 6. We are to output the next 96 points in the same format: date (from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00) and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n 7. Since we are an expert, we can use a library in our mind (like statsmodels) to fit a model. But note: we cannot run code, so we have to simulate the process.\n\n 8. Given the complexity, we might use a simple approach: \n    - The data shows a daily pattern: low during the day (especially around noon) and higher at night and early morning? \n    - But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day. We see negative values during the day and positive at night.\n\n 9. We can compute the average daily pattern and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n    Steps for a simple model:\n    a. Extract the seasonal component (24 hours) by averaging each hour of the day over the 4 days we have.\n    b. But note: we have 4 days, so 4 observations per hour. However, we see that the pattern is not stable (especially the negative spikes at noon are of different magnitudes).\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-06-17) as the base and then adjust by the trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 10. Given the time and the requirement, we might use a naive seasonal forecast: \n     - Use the last complete season (the last 24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n     But note: the problem says to forecast 96 hours (4 days) and we have 4 days of history. \n\n     However, the last day (2017-06-17) is:\n        00:00: 10.315\n        01:00: 9.377\n        02:00: 10.248\n        03:00: 9.377\n        04:00: 7.100\n        05:00: 9.779\n        06:00: 9.377\n        07:00: 5.492\n        08:00: -0.938\n        09:00: -4.890\n        10:00: -8.372\n        11:00: -10.717\n        12:00: -13.530\n        13:00: -11.655\n        14:00: -9.913\n        15:00: -6.095\n        16:00: 3.885\n        17:00: 5.894\n        18:00: 6.631\n        19:00: 6.765\n        20:00: 7.770\n        21:00: 7.837\n        22:00: 8.105\n        23:00: 8.306\n\n     We can use this day and repeat it 4 times? But that would be too naive and ignore the trend and the fact that the previous days are different.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n     For example, for hour 00:00: \n        Day1: 10.181\n        Day2: 7.167\n        Day3: 8.573\n        Day4: 10.315\n        Average = (10.181+7.167+8.573+10.315)/4 = 9.059\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we use the same average pattern? But that would be constant over the 4 days.\n\n 12. We can also consider a moving window or exponential smoothing for the seasonal indices.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and without actual computation, we decide to use a simple method: \n     We take the last day (2017-06-17) and use it as the forecast for the next day (2017-06-18). \n     Then, for the following days, we adjust by a drift (trend) component? \n\n     However, we don't have a clear trend. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, but that would be constant.\n\n 14. Considering the problem and the fact that we must provide 96 points, we choose to use the average of the 4 days for each hour of the day.\n\n     Steps:\n        - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n        - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average for that hour.\n\n     This method will give a repeating pattern every day, but note: the data has a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to know. And we are only forecasting 4 days.\n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (10.181 + 7.167 + 8.573 + 10.315)/4 = (10.181+7.167=17.348; 17.348+8.573=25.921; 25.921+10.315=36.236) -> 36.236/4 = 9.059\n     Hour 1: (9.645 + 8.105 + 8.707 + 9.377)/4 = (9.645+8.105=17.75; 17.75+8.707=26.457; 26.457+9.377=35.834) -> 35.834/4 = 8.9585\n     ... and so on.\n\n 16. However, note that the data has a very low point at hour 12 (noon) each day, but the magnitude varies. \n     We average them to get a more stable estimate.\n\n 17. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     Hour 0: 9.059\n     Hour 1: 8.9585\n     Hour 2: (9.377+8.038+8.908+10.248)/4 = (9.377+8.038=17.415; 17.415+8.908=26.323; 26.323+10.248=36.571) -> 9.14275\n     Hour 3: (8.774+6.899+7.636+9.377)/4 = (8.774+6.899=15.673; 15.673+7.636=23.309; 23.309+9.377=32.686) -> 8.1715\n     Hour 4: (8.640+5.492+7.636+7.100)/4 = (8.640+5.492=14.132; 14.132+7.636=21.768; 21.768+7.100=28.868) -> 7.217\n     Hour 5: (9.980+7.703+9.712+9.779)/4 = (9.980+7.703=17.683; 17.683+9.712=27.395; 27.395+9.779=37.174) -> 9.2935\n     Hour 6: (8.372+9.377+8.038+9.377)/4 = (8.372+9.377=17.749; 17.749+8.038=25.787; 25.787+9.377=35.164) -> 8.791\n     Hour 7: (7.033+7.100+5.492+5.492)/4 = (7.033+7.100=14.133; 14.133+5.492=19.625; 19.625+5.492=25.117) -> 6.27925\n     Hour 8: (5.358-1.407-0.469-0.938)/4 = (5.358-1.407=3.951; 3.951-0.469=3.482; 3.482-0.938=2.544) -> 0.636\n     Hour 9: (2.746-4.622-0.938-4.890)/4 = (2.746-4.622=-1.876; -1.876-0.938=-2.814; -2.814-4.890=-7.704) -> -1.926\n     Hour 10: (1.608-3.282-5.626-8.372)/4 = (1.608-3.282=-1.674; -1.674-5.626=-7.3; -7.3-8.372=-15.672) -> -3.918\n     Hour 11: (-0.536-6.564-4.890-10.717)/4 = (-0.536-6.564=-7.1; -7.1-4.890=-11.99; -11.99-10.717=-22.707) -> -5.67675\n     Hour 12: (-13.530-10.114-10.449-13.530)/4 -> (-13.530-10.114=-23.644; -23.644-10.449=-34.093; -34.093-13.530=-47.623) -> -11.90575\n     Hour 13: (-0.402-5.090-16.611-11.655)/4 = (-0.402-5.090=-5.492; -5.492-16.611=-22.103; -22.103-11.655=-33.758) -> -8.4395\n     Hour 14: (-3.617-2.277-12.793-9.913)/4 = (-3.617-2.277=-5.894; -5.894-12.793=-18.687; -18.687-9.913=-28.6) -> -7.15\n     Hour 15: (0.469+3.349-8.172-6.095)/4 = (0.469+3.349=3.818; 3.818-8.172=-4.354; -4.354-6.095=-10.449) -> -2.61225\n     Hour 16: (1.608+3.148-2.947+3.885)/4 = (1.608+3.148=4.756; 4.756-2.947=1.809; 1.809+3.885=5.694) -> 1.4235\n     Hour 17: (4.488+5.090+0.603+5.894)/4 = (4.488+5.090=9.578; 9.578+0.603=10.181; 10.181+5.894=16.075) -> 4.01875\n     Hour 18: (5.760+5.291+5.626+6.631)/4 = (5.760+5.291=11.051; 11.051+5.626=16.677; 16.677+6.631=23.308) -> 5.827\n     Hour 19: (6.363+6.765+6.564+6.765)/4 = (6.363+6.765=13.128; 13.128+6.564=19.692; 19.692+6.765=26.457) -> 6.61425\n     Hour 20: (7.167+7.301+7.301+7.770)/4 = (7.167+7.301=14.468; 14.468+7.301=21.769; 21.769+7.770=29.539) -> 7.38475\n     Hour 21: (6.832+7.100+6.832+7.837)/4 = (6.832+7.100=13.932; 13.932+6.832=20.764; 20.764+7.837=28.601) -> 7.15025\n     Hour 22: (6.698+7.100+7.033+8.105)/4 = (6.698+7.100=13.798; 13.798+7.033=20.831; 20.831+8.105=28.936) -> 7.234\n     Hour 23: (6.296+7.368+7.301+8.306)/4 = (6.296+7.368=13.664; 13.664+7.301=20.965; 20.965+8.306=29.271) -> 7.31775\n\n 18. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this average daily pattern 4 times.\n\n     The next 4: 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-18 23:00:00: use the 24 averages we computed.\n     Then 2017-06-19 00:00:00 to 2017-06-19 23:00:00: same 24 averages.\n     Then 2017-06-20 and 2017-06-21 similarly.\n\n 19. We must generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-06-18 00:00:00 (the last given date is 2017-06-17 23:00:00, so next is 2017-06-18 00:00:00)\n\n     We'll generate 96 hours: \n        Day 1: 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-18 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-06-19 00:00:00 to 2017-06-19 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-06-20 00:00:00 to 2017-06-20 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-06-21 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00\n\n 20. We output the data in the same format: two columns (date and HUFL) with 96 rows.\n\n 21. However, note: the average method might smooth out the extreme values. But it is a common approach.\n\n 22. We write the HUFL values rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 23. Let's list the 24 average values we computed (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n     Hour0: 9.059 -> 9.059\n     Hour1: 8.9585 -> 8.959\n     Hour2: 9.14275 -> 9.143\n     Hour3: 8.1715 -> 8.172\n     Hour4: 7.217 -> 7.217\n     Hour5: 9.2935 -> 9.294\n     Hour6: 8.791 -> 8.791\n     Hour7: 6.27925 -> 6.279\n     Hour8: 0.636 -> 0.636\n     Hour9: -1.926 -> -1.926\n     Hour10: -3.918 -> -3.918\n     Hour11: -5.67675 -> -5.677\n     Hour12: -11.90575 -> -11.906\n     Hour13: -8.4395 -> -8.440\n     Hour14: -7.15 -> -7.150\n     Hour15: -2.61225 -> -2.612\n     Hour16: 1.4235 -> 1.424\n     Hour17: 4.01875 -> 4.019\n     Hour18: 5.827 -> 5.827\n     Hour19: 6.61425 -> 6.614\n     Hour20: 7.38475 -> 7.385\n     Hour21: 7.15025 -> 7.150\n     Hour22: 7.234 -> 7.234\n     Hour23: 7.31775 -> 7.318\n\n 24. Now, we repeat this pattern 4 days.\n\n 25. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n               date    HUFL\n        2017-06-18 00:00:00   9.059\n        2017-06-18 01:00:00   8.959\n        ... \n        2017-06-18 23:00:00   7.318\n        2017-06-19 00:00:00   9.059\n        ... \n        2017-06-21 23:00:00   7.318\n\n 26. We must write 96 lines.\n\n 27. Let's generate the dates:\n\n     We start at 2017-06-18 00:00:00 and then increment by 1 hour until 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n 28.
