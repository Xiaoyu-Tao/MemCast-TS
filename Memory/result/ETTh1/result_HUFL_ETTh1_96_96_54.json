        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also some intra-day patterns.\n 2. Since the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we are only given 96 complete points to base our forecast on.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality of 24, we can use a seasonal ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing, but note that we have only 4 days (96 points) which is very limited.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n Given the limited data, we can use:\n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components.\n   - Or use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n But note: the data has two seasonality? (daily and weekly?) but we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly. So we focus on daily (24 periods).\n\n Approach:\n We can use the following:\n   - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with a seasonality of 24.\n\n However, with only 4 days (96 points) and seasonality of 24, we have exactly 4 seasonal periods. This is the minimum for fitting.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days.\n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that repeats daily but with some variation. Also, there might be a trend? Let's see:\n\n   The first day: \n        00:00 -> 10.382, 01:00->8.774, ... 23:00->11.454\n   The second day:\n        00:00 -> 9.377, ... 23:00->11.253\n   The third day:\n        00:00 -> 9.310, ... 23:00->10.516\n   The fourth day:\n        00:00 -> 8.774, ... 23:00->10.114\n\n There seems to be a slight downward trend? But also the values during the day vary.\n\n Since we are only forecasting 4 days ahead (96 hours) and we have 4 days of history, we can use the following naive method:\n\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and use that for the next 4 days?\n\n But note: the pattern might change? Also, we see that the fifth day (2017-02-06) is a Monday? and the given data starts on Thursday (2017-02-02) and ends on Sunday (2017-02-05). So the next 4 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n We might need to account for the weekly pattern? But we don't have enough data for that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Sunday) as the base and adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   We use a simple average of the same hour for the next 4 days. That is:\n\n        forecast for 2017-02-06 00:00:00 = average of 00:00 from the 4 days: (10.382 + 9.377 + 9.310 + 8.774) / 4\n        and so on for each hour.\n\n However, note that the data on Sunday (2017-02-05) might be different from Monday? But we don't have Monday data in history.\n\n Another approach: use the last complete cycle (the last 24 hours) and then adjust by the overall trend? But we have only 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average model with seasonality.\n\n Given the time and the requirement, I will use the average by hour for the next 96 hours (4 days). This is a simple and robust method.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n\n   Let the historical data be in a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours). Then for each hour h (0 to 23), we compute:\n\n        avg_h = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) we set each hour h to avg_h.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? We see a slight downward trend. We can adjust by a trend component.\n\n   We can compute the average for each day and then compute the daily trend. Then adjust the hourly average by the projected trend.\n\n However, for simplicity and because we have very limited data, we will use the hourly average without trend.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can compute the average.\n\n However, let's check: the provided data has 96 points, 4 days * 24 hours = 96. So we can reshape.\n\n Let me extract the values:\n\n   Day1: 2017-02-02: [10.382, 8.774, ... , 11.454] -> 24 values\n   Day2: 2017-02-03: [9.377, 7.904, ... , 11.253] -> 24 values\n   Day3: 2017-02-04: [9.310, 7.837, ... , 10.516] -> 24 values\n   Day4: 2017-02-05: [8.774, 7.301, ... , 10.114] -> 24 values\n\n Now, for each hour (0 to 23) we compute the average.\n\n Example for hour0 (00:00): \n        (10.382 + 9.377 + 9.310 + 8.774) / 4 = (10.382+9.377=19.759; 19.759+9.310=29.069; 29.069+8.774=37.843) -> 37.843/4 = 9.46075\n\n Similarly for hour1 (01:00):\n        (8.774 + 7.904 + 7.837 + 7.301) / 4 = (8.774+7.904=16.678; 16.678+7.837=24.515; 24.515+7.301=31.816) -> 31.816/4 = 7.954\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day5 (2017-02-06): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day6 (2017-02-07): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day7 (2017-02-08): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day8 (2017-02-09): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n This gives 96 points.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we can compute the average.\n\n But what if in the future we have missing? The problem says \"be aware of that\", but in this case we are only given 96 complete points. So we assume the provided 96 are complete.\n\n Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n   hour0: (10.382, 9.377, 9.310, 8.774) -> 9.46075\n   hour1: (8.774, 7.904, 7.837, 7.301) -> 7.954\n   hour2: (7.703, 7.033, 6.966, 6.564) -> 7.0665\n   hour3: (7.167, 6.430, 6.497, 5.961) -> 6.51375\n   hour4: (6.899, 6.229, 6.229, 5.626) -> 6.24575\n   hour5: (7.167, 6.162, 6.430, 5.760) -> 6.37975\n   hour6: (7.569, 6.564, 6.966, 6.229) -> 6.832\n   hour7: (9.377, 8.239, 8.908, 8.172) -> 8.674\n   hour8: (12.056, 11.788, 11.454, 10.918) -> 11.554\n   hour9: (9.511, 9.645, 9.578, 8.908) -> 9.4105\n   hour10: (7.368, 8.975, 7.435, 7.703) -> 7.12025? Wait, let me recalc: \n        7.368 + 8.975 = 16.343; 16.343+7.435=23.778; 23.778+7.703=31.481 -> 31.481/4=7.87025\n\n   Actually, let me do it:\n\n        hour10: \n            day1: 7.368\n            day2: 8.975? But wait, in the data for day2 (2017-02-03) at 10:00:00 -> 8.975? \n            Actually, looking at the data:\n\n                2017-02-03 10:00:00 -> 8.975? \n                But the data: \n                    2017-02-03 09:00:00  9.645\n                    2017-02-03 10:00:00  8.975   -> yes.\n\n            day3: 2017-02-04 10:00:00 -> 7.435\n            day4: 2017-02-05 10:00:00 -> 7.703\n\n        So: 7.368 + 8.975 + 7.435 + 7.703 = 31.481 -> 7.87025\n\n   hour11: \n        day1: 6.966\n        day2: 10.248? -> wait, 2017-02-03 11:00:00 -> 10.248? \n        day3: 2017-02-04 11:00:00 -> 7.569? Actually, the data for day3 (2017-02-04) at 11:00:00 is 7.569? \n            But the data says: \n                2017-02-04 11:00:00  7.569 -> yes.\n        day4: 2017-02-05 11:00:00 -> 6.832\n\n        So: 6.966 + 10.248 + 7.569 + 6.832 = 31.615 -> 7.90375\n\n   But wait, the day2 at 11:00:00 is 10.248 which is an outlier? \n\n   However, we are taking the average so it will be included.\n\n   We'll compute all 24.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a forecast, we use the mean.\n\n   We'll compute the 24 averages and then generate the next 96 points.\n\n Let me compute:\n\n   hour0: (10.382, 9.377, 9.310, 8.774) = 37.843/4 = 9.46075\n   hour1: (8.774, 7.904, 7.837, 7.301) = 31.816/4 = 7.954\n   hour2: (7.703, 7.033, 6.966, 6.564) = 28.266/4 = 7.0665\n   hour3: (7.167, 6.430, 6.497, 5.961) = 26.055/4 = 6.51375\n   hour4: (6.899, 6.229, 6.229, 5.626) = 24.983/4 = 6.24575\n   hour5: (7.167, 6.162, 6.430, 5.760) = 25.519/4 = 6.37975\n   hour6: (7.569, 6.564, 6.966, 6.229) = 27.328/4 = 6.832\n   hour7: (9.377, 8.239, 8.908, 8.172) = 34.696/4 = 8.674\n   hour8: (12.056, 11.788, 11.454, 10.918) = 46.216/4 = 11.554\n   hour9: (9.511, 9.645, 9.578, 8.908) = 37.642/4 = 9.4105\n   hour10: (7.368, 8.975, 7.435, 7.703) = 31.481/4 = 7.87025\n   hour11: (6.966, 10.248, 7.569, 6.832) = 31.615/4 = 7.90375\n   hour12: (6.229, 10.382, 6.631, 6.564) = 29.806/4 = 7.4515\n   hour13: (4.890, 9.712, 7.837, 2.746) = 25.185/4 = 6.29625\n   hour14: (4.019, 9.779, 8.239, -0.603) = 21.434/4 = 5.3585\n   hour15: (4.421, 10.851, 8.306, 0.201) = 23.779/4 = 5.94475\n   hour16: (8.975, 12.592, 8.439, 4.756) = 34.762/4 = 8.6905\n   hour17: (10.382, 12.860, 9.444, 8.908) = 41.594/4 = 10.3985\n   hour18: (11.521, 13.128, 10.717, 10.315) = 45.681/4 = 11.42025\n   hour19: (14.066, 14.736, 12.793, 12.793) = 54.388/4 = 13.597\n   hour20: (15.472, 15.405, 13.932, 14.200) = 59.009/4 = 14.75225\n   hour21: (15.405, 14.535, 13.865, 13.664) = 57.469/4 = 14.36725\n   hour22: (13.530, 13.195, 12.592, 12.123) = 51.44/4 = 12.86\n   hour23: (11.454, 11.253, 10.516, 10.114) = 43.337/4 = 10.83425\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2017-02-05 23:00:00)\n\n   We have 4 days: 2017-02-06, 2017-02-07, 2017-02-08, 2017-02-09.\n\n   For each day, we assign the 24 averages in order.\n\n   So:\n\n        2017-02-06 00:00:00 -> 9.46075\n        2017-02-06 01:00:00 -> 7.954\n        ...\n        2017-02-06 23:00:00 -> 10.83425\n\n        then 2017-02-07 00:00:00 -> 9.46075\n        ... and so on.\n\n We output the data in the same format: two columns: date and HUFL.\n\n We must output 96 rows.\n\n Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-06 00:00:00  9.46075\n2017-02-06 01:00:00  7.954\n...\n2017-02-09 23:00:00  10.83425\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are generating the forecast and we are not given any in the next 96. So we output the 96 forecasted values.\n\n However, the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output all 96.\n\n We'll write the dates accordingly.\n\n Let me generate the dates:\n\n   The last date in the input is 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n   Then:\n        2017-02-06 00:00:00\n        2017-02-06 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-02-06 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        2017-02-07 00:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        2017-02-08 00:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        2017-02-09 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n\n   Total 96.\n\n We'll output the dates in the same string format.\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. So we round each forecast to 3 decimals.\n\n Let me recompute the averages and round:\n\n   hour0: 9.46075 -> 9.461\n   hour1: 7.954 -> 7.954\n   hour2: 7.0665 -> 7.066\n   hour3: 6.51375 -> 6.514\n   hour4: 6.24575 -> 6.246\n   hour5: 6.37975 -> 6.380\n   hour6: 6.832 -> 6.832\n   hour7: 8.674 -> 8.674\n   hour8: 11.554 -> 11.554\n   hour9: 9.4105 -> 9.410\n   hour10: 7.87025 -> 7.870\n   hour11: 7.90375 -> 7.904\n   hour12: 7.4515 -> 7.452\n   hour13: 6.29625 -> 6.296\n   hour14: 5.3585 -> 5.358\n   hour15: 5.94475 -> 5.945\n   hour16: 8.6905 -> 8.690\n   hour17: 10.3985 -> 10.399\n   hour18: 11.42025 -> 11.420\n   hour19: 13.597 -> 13.597\n   hour20: 14.75225 -> 14.752\n   hour21: 14.36725 -> 14.367\n   hour22: 12.86 -> 12.860\n   note: 12.86 is 12.860? but we have 12.86 in the input? Actually, the input had 13.530, 13.195, etc. We output 3 decimals.\n   So 12.86 -> 12.860? Actually, we can format to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll format each number to 3 decimal places.\n\n   hour23: 10.83425 -> 10.834\n\n Now, we write the data.\n\n We'll create a list of dates:\n\n   from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00, hourly.\n\n   We can use pandas date_range? But we are not in code, we are writing the output.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        2017-02-06 00:00:00  9.461\n        2017-02-06 01:00:00  7.954\n        ... \n\n   for 4 days.\n\n Let me write the first day (2017-02-06) with the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: 9.461\n        hour1: 7.954\n        hour2: 7.066\n        hour3: 6.514\n        hour4: 6.246\n        hour5: 6.380\n        hour6: 6.832\n        hour7: 8.674\n        hour8: 11.554\n        hour9: 9.410\n        hour10: 7.870\n        hour11: 7.904\n        hour12: 7.452\n        hour13: 6.296\n        hour14: 5.358\n        hour15: 5.945\n        hour16: 8.690\n        hour17: 10.399\n        hour18: 11.420\n        hour19: 13.597\n        hour20: 14.752\n        hour21: 14.367\n        hour22: 12.860\n        hour23: 10.834\n\n Then repeat the same for the next three days.\n\n So the next day (2017-02-07) will have the same 24 numbers in the same order.\n\n We output 96 rows.\n\n We must be careful: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-06 00:00:00  9.461\n2017-02-06 01:00:00  7.954\n2017-02-06 02:00:00  7.066\n2017-02-06 03:00:00  6.514\n2017-02-06 04:00:00  6.246\n2017-02-06 05:00:00  6.380\n2017-02-06 06:00:00  6.832\n2017-02-06 07:00:00  8.674\n2017-02-06 08:00:00  11.554\n2017-02-06 09:00:00  9.410\n2017-02-06 10:00:00  7.870\n2017-02-06 11:00:00  7.904\n2017-02-06 12:00:00  7.452\n2017-02-06 13:00:00  6.296\n2017-02-06 14:00:00  5.358\n2017-02-06 15:00:00  5.945\n2017-02-06 16:00:00  8.690\n2017-02-06 17:00:00  10.399\n2017-02-06 18:00:00  11.420\n2017-02-06 19:00:00  13.597\n2017-02-06 20:00:00  14.752\n2017-02-06 21:00:00  14.367\n2017-02-06 22:00:00  12.860\n2017-02-06 23:00:00  10.834\n2017-02-07 00:00:00  9.461\n2017-02-07 01:00:00  7.954\n... and so on until 2017-02-09 23:00:00\n\n```\n\n We'll generate the next 3 days by repeating the same 24 numbers 4 times.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", so we start at 2017-02-06 00:00:00 and go for 96 hours.\n\n We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n However, note: the input had the HUFL as a float with 3 decimal places. We'll output the same.\n\n Let me write the output.\n\n We have 4 blocks of 24 lines.\n\n We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll do it.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are generating the forecast and we are not given any missing in the next 96? So we output the 96 without missing.\n\n We are done.\n\n But note: the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning that in the provided data there might be missing, but we are only given 96 complete points. So we are safe.\n\n Let me write the output in the required format.\n",
