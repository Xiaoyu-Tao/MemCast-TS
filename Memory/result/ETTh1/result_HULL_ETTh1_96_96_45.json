        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) metric.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the data has missing value warning. But in the provided data, there are no missing values in the given 96 points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points (next 4 days).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a suitable model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the fact that we are forecasting 96 steps ahead (long horizon), we need a model that can capture seasonality and trends.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - The data shows a daily pattern (24-hour seasonality). For example, on 2016-12-28, the values during the day (e.g., 00:00 to 23:00) have a pattern: high at the beginning, then a dip, then some fluctuations, and then a drop at night? But note that on 2016-12-31, the data is constant (1.206) for the entire day. This might be an anomaly or a holiday.\n\n However, we have only 4 days of data. The last day (2016-12-31) is constant, which is unusual.\n\n Considering the challenge, we can use:\n   - SARIMA: which can handle seasonality. But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be hard to estimate.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a simple method: take the average of the first three days (excluding the constant day) for each hour and use that as the forecast for the next days? But the constant day might be New Year's Eve and the next days might be similar? However, we don't have context.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we must generate a forecast.\n\n Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we can proceed.\n\n However, as an expert, I note that the last day (2016-12-31) is constant. This might be an anomaly. But without more context, we have to use the available data.\n\n Let's break down the data by hour of the day for the first three days and then the fourth day is constant.\n\n We can try to model the average pattern for each hour from the first three days and then use that for the next four days? But we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). However, the fourth day in the given data is constant, which might be a holiday. So the next days (starting 2017-01-01) might be holidays too? But we don't know.\n\n Since the problem does not specify, we have to use the data as is.\n\n Approach 1: Use the average of the first three days for each hour to form a daily profile, and then repeat that for the next four days.\n\n Steps:\n   - Group the first 72 points (3 days * 24 hours) by the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n   - Compute the mean for each hour (across the three days).\n   - Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat this daily profile 4 times.\n\n But note: the last day (2016-12-31) is constant. Should we include it? The problem says the data has missing values, but in this case, we have a constant. It might be an error? Or a holiday. Since we are forecasting the next 96 hours (which are the first four days of 2017), and if 2017-01-01 is a holiday, then the pattern might be similar to 2016-12-31? But we don't have enough data to confirm.\n\n However, the problem does not specify holidays. So we have two options:\n\n Option 1: Use the first three days (non-constant) to build the profile and ignore the constant day as an anomaly.\n\n Option 2: Use the last day (constant) as the pattern for holidays and assume the next four days are holidays? But that would lead to constant forecasts. However, the next 96 hours start on 2017-01-01 (New Year's Day) and then 2017-01-02, 03, 04. The first day (Jan 1) is a holiday, but the next days might not be? We don't have information.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"High UseLess Load\", which might be a transformed variable, we see negative values and positive, so it might be normalized.\n\n Considering the requirement to provide a forecast and the lack of context, I will use the average of the first three days for each hour to form a daily profile and then repeat it for the next four days.\n\n Why? Because the constant day might be an anomaly (or a holiday) and we don't know if the next days are holidays. Without more data, we assume the next four days are holidays. But the first three days show a pattern that is more typical? \n\n Let's compute the hourly averages for the first three days (2016-12-28, 29, 30):\n\n Hour 00: (2.344 + 1.674 + 3.014) / 3 = (2.344+1.674+3.014)=7.032/3=2.344\n Hour 01: (2.210 + 1.340 + 3.215) / 3 = (2.210+1.340+3.215)=6.765/3=2.255\n ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for 2016-12-30 00:00:00 is 3.014, which is higher. So we take the average.\n\n However, we must also note that the data might have a trend? But with only three days, it's hard to tell.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a time series model that accounts for seasonality and uses the entire 96 points? But the last day is constant, which might break the model.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we must provide 96 points, I choose to use the average of the first three days for each hour and then repeat that pattern for the next four days.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Extract the first 72 points (3 days) and group by hour (0 to 23).\n 2. For each hour, compute the mean.\n 3. Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will have 4 cycles of the 24-hour profile.\n\n But note: the last day (2016-12-31) is constant. We are not using it for the profile, but we are forecasting the next 96 hours (which are 4 days). So we are generating 4 days of the typical pattern.\n\n However, if we believe the next days are holidays, we might use the constant pattern? But the problem does not specify. So we stick to the typical pattern.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n Hour 00: [2.344, 1.674, 3.014] -> mean = (2.344+1.674+3.014)/3 = 6.032/3 = 2.344 (wait, 2.344+1.674=4.018, +3.014=7.032 -> 7.032/3=2.344)\n Actually: 7.032/3 = 2.344? 7.032/3 = 2.344 exactly? Let me calculate: 7.032 / 3 = 2.344.\n\n But let me do it step by step:\n\n Hour 00: \n   2016-12-28: 2.344\n   2016-12-29: 1.674\n   2016-12-30: 3.014\n   Sum = 2.344 + 1.674 = 4.018; 4.018 + 3.014 = 7.032; 7.032 / 3 = 2.344\n\n Hour 01:\n   2016-12-28: 2.210\n   2016-12-29: 1.340\n   2016-12-30: 3.215\n   Sum = 2.210+1.340=3.550; 3.550+3.215=6.765; 6.765/3=2.255\n\n Hour 02:\n   2016-12-28: 0.804\n   2016-12-29: 2.210\n   2016-12-30: 1.942\n   Sum = 0.804+2.210=3.014; 3.014+1.942=4.956; 4.956/3=1.652\n\n Hour 03:\n   2016-12-28: 1.005\n   2016-12-29: 2.076\n   2016-12-30: 1.942\n   Sum = 1.005+2.076=3.081; 3.081+1.942=5.023; 5.023/3=1.674333... -> 1.674\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the data has negative values and we are averaging, so it's fine.\n\n But wait, the last day (2016-12-31) is constant. We are ignoring it because we are using the first three days to form the pattern.\n\n We'll compute the 24 hourly averages and then repeat them 4 times for the next 96 hours.\n\n The next 96 hours start at 2017-01-01 00:00:00 and go to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Let hourly_avg = [ avg_00, avg_01, ... , avg_23 ]\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n       2017-01-01 00:00:00 -> avg_00\n       2017-01-01 01:00:00 -> avg_01\n       ...\n       2017-01-01 23:00:00 -> avg_23\n       2017-01-02 00:00:00 -> avg_00\n       ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data on 2016-12-31 was constant. We are not using that pattern because we are forecasting beyond that. However, if we believe that the next days (Jan 1,2,3,4) are holidays, then we might use the constant pattern? But we don't have enough information to assume that. Also, the problem does not specify.\n\n Since the problem says \"High UseLess Load\", and we are to forecast, we use the typical pattern (first three days) as the base.\n\n However, we must note that the first three days are not holidays? We don't know. But the last day of the year (Dec 31) is a holiday (New Year's Eve) and Jan 1 is a holiday. So maybe we should use the constant pattern for Jan 1 and then the typical pattern for the next three days? But again, we don't have enough data to be sure.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and to be safe, we will use the typical pattern (first three days) for all four days. If the client expects holidays, they should have provided more context.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n We'll list the 24 hours (0 to 23) and the three values for each:\n\n Hour 0: [2.344, 1.674, 3.014] -> 2.032/3? Wait, we did above: 2.344, 1.674, 3.014 -> 7.032/3 = 2.344\n But wait, 7.032/3 is 2.344? Let me recalculate: 2.344+1.674=4.018, 4.018+3.014=7.032 -> 7.032/3=2.344.\n\n Actually, 7.032 divided by 3 is 2.344 exactly? 3*2.344=7.032? 3*2.344=7.032 -> yes.\n\n So:\n\n H0: 2.344\n H1: (2.210+1.340+3.215)=6.765/3=2.255\n H2: (0.804+2.210+1.942)=4.956/3=1.652\n H3: (1.005+2.076+1.942)=5.023/3=1.674333... -> round to 3 decimals? The data has 3 decimals. So 1.674\n H4: (1.474+2.210+1.005)=4.689/3=1.563\n H5: (1.206+1.808+1.206)=4.220/3=1.406666... -> 1.407\n H6: (0.938+2.277+1.541)=4.756/3=1.585333... -> 1.585\n H7: (1.340+0.402+1.340)=3.082/3=1.027333... -> 1.027\n H8: (1.206+1.942+1.741)=4.889/3=1.629666... -> 1.630\n H9: (1.273+1.340+0.536)=3.149/3=1.049666... -> 1.050\n H10: (0.737+0.536+0.000)=1.273/3=0.424333... -> 0.424\n H11: (0.804+2.076+0.067)=2.947/3=0.982333... -> 0.982\n H12: (-1.005+1.808-0.871)= -0.068/3 = -0.022666... -> -0.023\n H13: (0.536+0.201+0.402)=1.139/3=0.379666... -> 0.380\n H14: (0.737+0.737-0.402)=1.072/3=0.357333... -> 0.357\n H15: (0.201+0.737-0.201)=0.737/3=0.245666... -> 0.246\n H16: (0.000+0.201-0.067)=0.134/3=0.044666... -> 0.045\n H17: (0.134+0.000+0.000)=0.134/3=0.044666... -> 0.045\n H18: (-0.469-0.268-0.201)= -0.938/3 = -0.312666... -> -0.313\n H19: (-0.201-0.335-0.402)= -0.938/3 = -0.312666... -> -0.313\n H20: (-0.402-0.402-0.469)= -1.273/3 = -0.424333... -> -0.424\n H21: (-0.938-1.139-0.938)= -3.015/3 = -1.005\n H22: (1.474+1.407+0.402)=3.283/3=1.094333... -> 1.094\n H23: (1.474+0.402+1.072)=2.948/3=0.982666... -> 0.983\n\n Now, we have 24 values for the daily profile.\n\n Then, for the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00) we repeat this profile 4 times.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-01 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-01-01 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n\n We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n Example for 2017-01-01:\n   00:00:00 -> H0: 2.344\n   01:00:00 -> H1: 2.255\n   ...\n   23:00:00 -> H23: 0.983\n\n Then 2017-01-02 00:00:00 -> H0: 2.344, and so on.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are generating a forecast without missing values? The forecast should be complete.\n\n We must outputting 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n   date from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00, with the corresponding value from the profile.\n\n But note: the last given date is 2016-12-31 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-01-01 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   2017-01-01 00:00:00  2.344\n   2017-01-01 01:00:00  2.255\n   2017-01-01 02:00:00  1.652\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n However, note: the input has negative values and we have computed negative averages for some hours.\n\n Let me double-check the averages for H12, H18, H19, H20, H21: they are negative.\n\n We'll output the data in the required format.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll write 96 lines.\n\n Let me write the first few:\n\n   date                HULL\n   2017-01-01 00:00:00 2.344\n   2017-01-01 01:00:00 2.255\n   2017-01-01 02:00:00 1.652\n   2017-01-01 03:00:00 1.674\n   2017-01-01 04:00:00 1.563\n   2017-01-01 05:00:00 1.407\n   2017-01-01 06:00:00 1.585\n   2017-01-01 07:00:00 1.027\n   2017-01-01 08:00:00 1.630\n   2017-01-01 09:00:00 1.050\n   2017-01-01 10:00:00 0.424\n   2017-01-01 11:00:00 0.982\n   2017-01-01 12:00:00 -0.023\n   2017-01-01 13:00:00 0.380\n   2017-01-01 14:00:00 0.357\n   2017-01-01 15:00:00 0.246\n   2017-01-01 16:00:00 0.045\n   2017-01-01 17:00:00 0.045\n   2017-01-01 18:00:00 -0.313\n   2017-01-01 19:00:00 -0.313\n   2017-01-01 20:00:00 -0.424\n   2017-01-01 21:00:00 -1.005\n   2017-01-01 22:00:00 1.094\n   2017-01-01 23:00:00 0.983\n\n Then the next day (2017-01-02) starts again with 2.344 at 00:00:00.\n\n We'll do this for 4 days.\n\n However, note: the last day of the forecast (2017-01-04) will end at 23:00:00 with 0.983.\n\n We'll generate the dates programmatically.\n\n But note: the date format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n We'll write the dates as:\n\n   2017-01-01 00:00:00\n   2017-01-01 01:00:00\n   ... \n   2017-01-01 23:00:00\n   2017-01-02 00:00:00\n   ... \n   2017-01-04 23:00:00\n\n We have 4*24=96 entries.\n\n Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n Important: The answer must be enclosed in <answer> and </answer> tags, and the data must be in the same format as the input (with the date and the value, separated by space, and the value with 3 decimal places).\n\n We'll write:\n\n   <answer>\n        date                HULL\n        2017-01-01 00:00:00 2.344\n        2017-01-01 01:00:00 2.255\n        ... \n   </answer>\n\n But note: the example input had the header \"date   HULL\", so we include the header.\n\n However, the problem says \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", so we must include the header? The example input had a header.\n\n We'll include the header.\n\n But note: the example input had the header and then the data. So we do the same.\n\n However, the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", so we output the header and the 96 rows.\n\n But wait, the input had the header? The problem says: \"Here is the High UseLess Load data of the transformer. I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then it showed a table with a header.\n\n So we output:\n\n   date   HULL\n   ... 96 lines ...\n\n But note: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we are to output the data for the next 96 dates, so we output 96 data points (with the header).\n\n However, the example input had the header and 96 data points. So we output the same structure.\n\n But note: the problem says \"And your final answer must follow the format\", and the example format was:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n We'll write the data as a code block? The example had triple backticks. But the problem says \"strictly\", so we must use the exact format.\n\n Actually, the example format was:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n So we write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate   HULL\n2017-01-01 00:00:00 2.344\n2017-01-01 01:00:00 2.255\n...\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the example input had the date and the value separated by two spaces? Actually, the example input had:\n\n                date   HULL\n   2016-12-28 00:00:00  2.344\n\n We see that the date is left-aligned and then the value is with a space? Actually, the header had \"date   HULL\" (with multiple spaces) and the data had a space after the date and then the value.\n\n We'll use a single space between the date and the value? But the input had:\n\n   \"2016-12-28 00:00:00  2.344\" -> two spaces? Actually, in the text it's shown with two spaces? But in the markdown, it might be rendered as one. We'll use one space to separate the date and the value? Or we can use a tab? The problem does not specify.\n\n Looking at the input: the first line has \"date   HULL\" (with three spaces) and the data lines have the date string (which is 19 characters) and then two spaces and then the value? \n\n Let me count:\n\n   The date string: \"2016-12-28 00:00:00\" is 19 characters.\n\n   Then in the data: \"2016-12-28 00:00:00  2.344\" -> after the 19 characters, there are two spaces and then the number.\n\n So we'll format each line as:\n\n   [date string] + \"  \" + [value]\n\n For example: \"2017-01-01 00:00:00  2.344\"\n\n We'll do that.\n\n Now, we generate the 96 lines.\n\n We have the 24-hour profile:\n\n   profile = [\n        2.344,  # H0\n        2.255,  ... ]\n\n Then for day in range(4): # 4 days\n   for hour in range(24):\n        date = start_date + day*24 + hour (in hours)\n\n Start date: 2017-01-01 00:00:00\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   day0: 2017-01-01\n   day1: 2017-01-02\n   day2: 2017-01-03\n   day3: 2017-01-04\n\n We'll write:\n\n   for i in range(96):\n        date = (2017-01-01 00:00:00) + i hours\n\n We can use:\n\n   base = datetime(2017, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n   then for i in range(96):\n        d = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n But we are writing in a text file, so we format the date as string: \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n\n However, we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n We'll write the 96 lines manually? No, we have the profile and we repeat it 4 times.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-01-01, hours 0-23: use profile[0] to profile[23]\n   Day 2: 2017-01-02, hours 0-23: same profile\n   Day 3: 2017-01-03, hours 0-23: same profile\n   Day 4: 2017-01-04, hours 0-23: same profile\n\n We have the profile as a list of 24 numbers.\n\n We'll write the list for the four days.\n\n Let me write the entire 96 lines with the computed profile.\n\n But note: we must be cautious of rounding. We computed the averages to 3 decimals by rounding the computed average to 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll output the numbers as we computed.\n\n However, we must note that the input data had 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll write the profile with 3 decimal places.\n\n The computed profile (with rounding to 3 decimal places) is:\n\n   H0: 2.344\n   H1: 2.255\n   H2: 1.652\n   H3: 1.674\n   H4: 1.563\n   H5: 1.407\n   H6: 1.585\n   H7: 1.027\n   H8: 1.630\n   H9: 1.050\n   H10: 0.424\n   H11: 0.982\n   H12: -0.023\n   H13: 0.380\n   H14: 0.357\n   H15: 0.246\n   H16: 0.045\n   H17: 0.045\n   H18: -0.313\n   H19: -0.313\n   H20: -0.424\n   H21: -1.005\n   H22: 1.094\n   H23: 0.983\n\n Now, we write the data:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-01-01\n   Day 2: 2017-01-02\n   Day 3: 2017-01-03\n   Day 4: 2017-01-04\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   2017-01-01 00:00:00  2.344\n   2017-01-01 01:00:00  2.255\n   2017-01-01 02:00:00  1.652\n   2017-01-01 03:00:00  1.674\n   2017-01-01 04:00:00  1.563\n   2017-01-01 05:00:00  1.407\n   2017-01-01 06:00:00  1.585\n   2017-01-01 07:00:00  1.027\n   2017-01-01 08:00:00  1.630\n   2017-01-01 09:00:00  1.050\n   2017-01-01 10:00:00  0.424\n   2017-01-01 11:00:00  0.982\n   2017-01-01 12:00:00  -0.023\n   2017-01-01 13:00:00  0.380\n   2017-01-01 14:00:00  0.357\n   2017-01-01 15:00:00  0.246\n   2017-01-01 16:00:00  0.045\n   2017-01-01 17:00:00  0.045\n   2017-01-01 18:00:00  -0.313\n   2017-01-01 19:00:00  -0.313\n   2017-01-01 20:00:00  -0.424\n   2017-01-01 21:00:00  -1.005\n   2017-01-01 22:00:00  1.094\n   2017-01-01 23:00:00  0.983\n\n   Day 2: same as day1, but date 2017-01-02\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll write 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and we are providing 96 lines.\n\n We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" but we are not missing any value in the provided 96 points, and we are generating a complete forecast. So we are good.\n\n Let's write the answer.\n",
