        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-30 00:00:00 to 2017-07-03 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but in this case, we have a complete set.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a suitable time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long-term forecast for this context), we can consider:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) if there is seasonality. However, 96 points (4 days) might show daily seasonality (24 hours). \n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) to capture both the non-seasonal and seasonal patterns.\n\n 4. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (24 hours). For example, on 2017-06-30, the values start at 1.990, then go down and then up again during the day, and similar patterns on the next days.\n\n 5. We will use a model that can capture seasonality. Since the seasonality period is 24 (for hourly data with daily seasonality), we can use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) with a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 6. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We need to check for stationarity and seasonality. However, due to the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast the next 4 days, we can try a standard seasonal ARIMA model.\n\n 7. We can use the following approach:\n    - We will use the SARIMAX model from the statsmodels library in Python (if we were to code). But since we are to generate the forecast without coding, we must rely on typical patterns.\n\n 8. However, note: We are an AI that can simulate the process. We must generate the next 96 points.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the data, we can simulate a forecast by:\n    - Extending the pattern of the last 4 days to the next 4 days, but with some adjustments for any trend.\n\n 10. But note: the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. It seems to be stationary in the overall level.\n\n 11. We can also consider using a naive seasonal forecast: using the average of the same hour from the previous days. However, we have 4 days of history.\n\n    For example, the forecast for 2017-07-04 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-07-03) would be the average of:\n        2017-06-30 00:00:00: 1.990\n        2017-07-01 00:00:00: 1.777\n        2017-07-02 00:00:00: 0.995\n        2017-07-03 00:00:00: 2.630\n\n    Average = (1.990 + 1.777 + 0.995 + 2.630) / 4 = 1.848\n\n    Similarly, for 00:00:00 of the next days, we would use the same average? But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we have 4 points at 00:00:00.\n\n 12. However, this naive method does not account for any trend or changing conditions. Also, the data on 2017-07-03 is higher than the previous days.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days, but then we don't have more than 4 days. So we can use the same 4 days for each hour.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not told that the provided data has missing values, but we are to be aware. Since the provided data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n 15. We are to generate 96 points. We can generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n 16. We decide to use a simple method: for each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 available days. Then we use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    However, this would give the same pattern for each of the next 4 days. But note: the data does not show a strong trend, and we have only 4 days.\n\n 17. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.990 + 1.777 + 0.995 + 2.630) / 4 = 1.848\n        hour1: (1.421 + 2.523 + 1.137 + 2.843) / 4 = (1.421+2.523+1.137+2.843)/4 = 7.924/4 = 1.981\n        ... and so on.\n\n 18. But note: the data on 2017-07-03 is generally higher than the previous days. So if we use the average, we are smoothing out the recent increase? \n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? But without a clear trend, the simple average might be acceptable.\n\n 20. However, we must also consider that the problem says \"missing values\" might be present. Since we are not told which ones are missing in the provided data, and we have 96 complete points, we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n 21. We will generate the next 96 points by repeating the 4-day average pattern for the next 4 days? But wait, that would be the same for each day. However, the pattern might be consistent.\n\n 22. But note: the problem does not specify any day-of-week effect. We have data from Friday (2017-06-30) to Monday (2017-07-03). The next 4 days would be Tuesday to Friday (2017-07-04 to 2017-07-07). We don't have data for Tuesday, so we are using the average of the available days.\n\n 23. Given the constraints, we will compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 24. Steps to compute:\n    - Group the data by hour (ignoring the day).\n    - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the MULL values at that hour.\n\n 25. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign:\n        Day 1 (2017-07-04): hour0 to hour23: the average for hour0 to hour23.\n        Day 2 (2017-07-05): same as above, the same averages for each hour.\n        Day 3 (2017-07-06): same\n        Day 4 (2017-07-07): same\n\n 26. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 27. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [1.990, 1.777, 0.995, 2.630] -> (1.990+1.777+0.995+2.630)/4 = 7.392/4 = 1.848\n        hour1: [1.421, 2.523, 1.137, 2.843] -> (1.421+2.523+1.137+2.843) = 7.924 -> 1.981\n        hour2: [1.279, 2.061, 0.497, 2.985] -> (1.279+2.061+0.497+2.985)=6.822 -> 1.7055\n        hour3: [0.995, 1.990, 1.492, 2.239] -> (0.995+1.990+1.492+2.239)=6.716 -> 1.679\n        hour4: [1.031, 1.350, 0.533, 1.031] -> (1.031+1.350+0.533+1.031)=3.945 -> 0.98625\n        hour5: [1.244, 2.416, 0.817, 1.528] -> (1.244+2.416+0.817+1.528)=6.005 -> 1.50125\n        hour6: [1.492, 0.853, -0.213, 1.208] -> (1.492+0.853-0.213+1.208)=3.34 -> 0.835\n        hour7: [1.350, 2.452, 0.569, 2.736] -> (1.350+2.452+0.569+2.736)=7.107 -> 1.77675\n        hour8: [2.239, 2.736, 1.102, 2.239] -> (2.239+2.736+1.102+2.239)=8.316 -> 2.079\n        hour9: [2.843, 2.097, 0.782, 2.203] -> (2.843+2.097+0.782+2.203)=7.925 -> 1.98125\n        hour10: [2.559, 1.741, 0.604, 2.203] -> (2.559+1.741+0.604+2.203)=7.107 -> 1.77675\n        hour11: [2.345, 1.954, 1.492, 4.051] -> (2.345+1.954+1.492+4.051)=9.842 -> 2.4605\n        hour12: [1.031, 1.173, 0.853, 2.061] -> (1.031+1.173+0.853+2.061)=5.118 -> 1.2795\n        hour13: [1.137, 1.670, 1.564, 2.310] -> (1.137+1.670+1.564+2.310)=6.681 -> 1.67025\n        hour14: [2.025, 2.061, 0.995, 1.919] -> (2.025+2.061+0.995+1.919)=7.000 -> 1.750\n        hour15: [1.279, 1.635, 1.777, 3.269] -> (1.279+1.635+1.777+3.269)=7.96 -> 1.99\n        hour16: [1.066, 0.924, 1.244, 1.777] -> (1.066+0.924+1.244+1.777)=5.011 -> 1.25275\n        hour17: [1.102, 0.604, 0.569, 1.421] -> (1.102+0.604+0.569+1.421)=3.696 -> 0.924\n        hour18: [0.000, 0.178, 0.604, 0.959] -> (0.000+0.178+0.604+0.959)=1.741 -> 0.43525\n        hour19: [-0.036, 0.249, 0.533, 0.746] -> (-0.036+0.249+0.533+0.746)=1.492 -> 0.373\n        hour20: [0.142, 0.036, 0.426, 0.569] -> (0.142+0.036+0.426+0.569)=1.173 -> 0.29325\n        hour21: [0.249, -0.426, 0.036, 0.249] -> (0.249-0.426+0.036+0.249)=0.108 -> 0.027\n        hour22: [0.391, 0.071, 0.249, 0.853] -> (0.391+0.071+0.249+0.853)=1.564 -> 0.391\n        hour23: [1.173, 0.355, 0.746, 1.173] -> (1.173+0.355+0.746+1.173)=3.447 -> 0.86175\n\n 28. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-04 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.848\n        Then 2017-07-04 01:00:00 -> hour1: 1.981\n        ... until 2017-07-04 23:00:00 -> hour23: 0.86175\n\n        Then 2017-07-05 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.848\n        ... and so on until 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We must format the dates correctly. The last date in the input is 2017-07-03 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-07-04 00:00:00.\n\n 30. We generate 96 rows.\n\n 31. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 32. However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 33. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 34. Let's create the data:\n\n        First row: 2017-07-04 00:00:00, 1.848 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 1.848\n        Second row: 2017-07-04 01:00:00, 1.981 -> 1.981\n        ...\n\n 35. We note that the computed averages are already to 3 decimal places? But we have more in the calculation. We will round to 3 decimals.\n\n 36. We'll write a list of the next 96 timestamps and the corresponding MULL value (the average for that hour, rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n 37. We must be cautious: the input data has negative values and zeros, so our forecast might have negative values and zeros as well.\n\n 38. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-04 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-07-07 23:00:00\n\n 39. We'll create a list:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-07-04 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 40. And the MULL values will be:\n\n        hour0: 1.848 -> for 2017-07-04 00:00:00, 2017-07-05 00:00:00, 2017-07-06 00:00:00, 2017-07-07 00:00:00\n        hour1: 1.981 -> for 2017-07-04 01:00:00, 2017-07-05 01:00:00, ... etc.\n\n 41. We'll write the data in the same format as the input: two columns: 'date' and 'MULL'\n\n 42. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MULL\n        2017-07-04 00:00:00, 1.848\n        2017-07-04 01:00:00, 1.981\n        ... \n        2017-07-07 23:00:00, 0.862   [because 0.86175 rounded to 3 decimals is 0.862]\n\n 43. But note: the input uses a space after the comma? Actually, the input is given with spaces. However, the example input has:\n\n            \"2017-06-30 00:00:00  1.990\"\n\n        It uses multiple spaces. But we can use a fixed format: we'll align the dates and the numbers to match the input.\n\n 44. However, the problem says: \"give me the complete data\" and the format in the example input. The example input uses:\n\n            \"2017-06-30 00:00:00  1.990\"\n\n        with a tab or multiple spaces? Actually, it's not clear. We can use a fixed space of 2 or more. We see that the example has:\n\n            \"2017-06-30 00:00:00  1.990\"\n\n        There are two spaces between the time and the number? Actually, the example has:\n\n            \"2017-06-30 00:00:00  1.990\"\n\n        It has two spaces. But in the data, the numbers are aligned. We can use:\n\n            [date string] + \"  \" + [MULL string]\n\n        But to be safe, we can use a format of:\n\n            f\"{date}  {MULL:.3f}\"\n\n        and we'll make sure the date string is exactly as in the input.\n\n 45. The input date format: \"2017-06-30 00:00:00\"\n\n 46. We generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 47. We note: the rounding: we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. Let's list the hourly averages we computed, rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 1.848\n        hour1: 1.981\n        hour2: 1.706   (because 1.7055 -> 1.706)\n        hour3: 1.679\n        hour4: 0.986   (0.98625 -> 0.986)\n        hour5: 1.501   (1.50125 -> 1.501)\n        hour6: 0.835\n        hour7: 1.777   (1.77675 -> 1.777)\n        hour8: 2.079\n        hour9: 1.981   (1.98125 -> 1.981)\n        hour10: 1.777   (1.77675 -> 1.777)\n        hour11: 2.461   (2.4605 -> 2.461)\n        hour12: 1.280   (1.2795 -> 1.280)\n        hour13: 1.670   (1.67025 -> 1.670)\n        hour14: 1.750\n        hour15: 1.990\n        hour16: 1.253   (1.25275 -> 1.253)\n        hour17: 0.924\n        hour18: 0.435   (0.43525 -> 0.435)\n        hour19: 0.373\n        hour20: 0.293   (0.29325 -> 0.293)\n        hour21: 0.027\n        hour22: 0.391\n        hour23: 0.862   (0.86175 -> 0.862)\n\n 49. Now, we write the data for the next 4 days using these 24 values, repeated for each day.\n\n 50. We generate:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-04: from hour0 to hour23: [1.848, 1.981, 1.706, ... , 0.862]\n        Day2: 2017-07-05: same sequence\n        Day3: 2017-07-06: same\n        Day4: 2017-07-07: same\n\n 51. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-07-04 00:00:00  1.848\n        2017-07-04 01:00:00  1.981\n        2017-07-04 02:00:00  1.706\n        2017-07-04 03:00:00  1.679\n        2017-07-04 04:00:00  0.986\n        2017-07-04 05:00:00  1.501\n        2017-07-04 06:00:00  0.835\n        2017-07-04 07:00:00  1.777\n        2017-07-04 08:00:00  2.079\n        2017-07-04 09:00:00  1.981\n        2017-07-04 10:00:00  1.777\n        2017-07-04 11:00:00  2.461\n        2017-07-04 12:00:00  1.280\n        2017-07-04 13:00:00  1.670\n        2017-07-04 14:00:00  1.750\n        2017-07-04 15:00:00  1.990\n        2017-07-04 16:00:00  1.253\n        2017-07-04 17:00:00  0.924\n        2017-07-04 18:00:00  0.435\n        2017-07-04 19:00:00  0.373\n        2017-07-04 20:00:00  0.293\n        2017-07-04 21:00:00  0.027\n        2017-07-04 22:00:00  0.391\n        2017-07-04 23:00:00  0.862\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next three days.\n\n 52.
