        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can observe that the load varies throughout the day.\n 2. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast the next 4 days, we can use a simple method that captures the daily seasonality.\n 3. Since the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't see any (it's consecutive), we assume the next 96 will be forecasted without gaps.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a seasonal naive method, which uses the last complete season (24 hours) to forecast the next season. However, we have 4 days of history, so we can also average the same hour across the 4 days to get a more robust forecast.\n\n Let's break down:\n   - We have 4 days (96 hours) of data, so 4 observations for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00).\n   - We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the first and last day:\n\n  2017-06-18: min -0.548, max 0.000\n  2017-06-19: min -0.670, max -0.244\n  2017-06-20: min -0.731, max -0.152\n  2017-06-21: min -0.975, max -0.152\n\n There seems to be a downward trend? However, we are only forecasting 4 days ahead and with such a short history, it's hard to model a trend. Alternatively, we can use the last day (or the average of the last two days) to forecast the next day? But the problem says the data might have missing values, but in this case we don't have any in the history.\n\n Considering the requirement for simplicity and the fact that we are only 4 days, we can do:\n\n   Option 1: Use the last day (2017-06-21) as the forecast for the next day, then the day after that, and so on? But that would be repeating the same day 4 times.\n\n   Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. This would smooth out the daily pattern and might be more robust.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   For hour 00:00: (-0.396, -0.609, -0.609, -0.944) -> average = (-0.396 -0.609 -0.609 -0.944)/4 = -0.6395\n   For hour 01:00: (-0.426, -0.609, -0.609, -0.944) -> average = (-0.426 -0.609 -0.609 -0.944)/4 = -0.647\n\n But wait, the last day (2017-06-21) has a more negative trend. If we average, we are including the downward trend? However, for a 4 days ahead, we don't know if the trend will continue or stabilize.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we choose:\n\n   Method: We will use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Why?\n   - It captures the daily pattern and smooths out the day-to-day variations.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the mean of that hour from the 4 days.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00), we assign the corresponding hourly average.\n\n However, note: the last provided data point is at 2017-06-21 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-22 23:00:00\n   Day 2: 2017-06-23 00:00:00 to 2017-06-23 23:00:00\n   Day 3: 2017-06-24 00:00:00 to 2017-06-24 23:00:00\n   Day 4: 2017-06-25 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00\n\n We will generate the dates accordingly.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n   Step 2: Create the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-06-22 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 3: For each timestamp, we take the hour and assign the precomputed average for that hour.\n\n But note: the data we have is for 4 days. We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n   Day1: 2017-06-18 00:00:00 -> -0.396\n   Day2: 2017-06-19 00:00:00 -> -0.609\n   Day3: 2017-06-20 00:00:00 -> -0.609\n   Day4: 2017-06-21 00:00:00 -> -0.944\n   Average = (-0.396 -0.609 -0.609 -0.944) / 4 = -0.6395\n\n Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n   Day1: -0.426\n   Day2: -0.609\n   Day3: -0.609\n   Day4: -0.944\n   Average = (-0.426 -0.609 -0.609 -0.944) / 4 = -0.647\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the data might have a downward trend. But without more data, we assume that the pattern will be the average of the last 4 days.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour00: (-0.396, -0.609, -0.609, -0.944) -> -0.6395\n   hour01: (-0.426, -0.609, -0.609, -0.944) -> -0.647\n   hour02: (-0.426, -0.579, -0.731, -0.975) -> (-0.426 -0.579 -0.731 -0.975)/4 = -0.67775\n   hour03: (-0.305, -0.579, -0.701, -0.822) -> (-0.305 -0.579 -0.701 -0.822)/4 = -0.60175\n   hour04: (-0.305, -0.609, -0.701, -0.701) -> (-0.305 -0.609 -0.701 -0.701)/4 = -0.579\n   hour05: (-0.335, -0.579, -0.609, -0.670) -> (-0.335 -0.579 -0.609 -0.670)/4 = -0.54825\n   hour06: (-0.183, -0.548, -0.426, -0.548) -> (-0.183 -0.548 -0.426 -0.548)/4 = -0.42625\n   hour07: (-0.061, -0.396, -0.396, -0.487) -> (-0.061 -0.396 -0.396 -0.487)/4 = -0.335\n   hour08: ( 0.000, -0.457, -0.213, -0.152) -> (0.000 -0.457 -0.213 -0.152)/4 = -0.2055\n   hour09: (-0.091, -0.548, -0.274, -0.213) -> (-0.091 -0.548 -0.274 -0.213)/4 = -0.2815\n   hour10: (-0.030, -0.396, -0.457, -0.213) -> (-0.030 -0.396 -0.457 -0.213)/4 = -0.274\n   hour11: (-0.061, -0.305, -0.548, -0.396) -> (-0.061 -0.305 -0.548 -0.396)/4 = -0.3275\n   hour12: (-0.274, -0.274, -0.579, -0.518) -> (-0.274 -0.274 -0.579 -0.518)/4 = -0.41125\n   hour13: (-0.213, -0.396, -0.335, -0.487) -> (-0.213 -0.396 -0.335 -0.487)/4 = -0.35775\n   hour14: (-0.305, -0.244, -0.426, -0.457) -> (-0.305 -0.244 -0.426 -0.457)/4 = -0.358\n   hour15: (-0.396, -0.274, -0.366, -0.487) -> (-0.396 -0.274 -0.366 -0.487)/4 = -0.38075\n   hour16: (-0.426, -0.274, -0.305, -0.640) -> (-0.426 -0.274 -0.305 -0.640)/4 = -0.41125\n   hour17: (-0.396, -0.305, -0.305, -0.487) -> (-0.396 -0.305 -0.305 -0.487)/4 = -0.37325\n   hour18: (-0.457, -0.305, -0.609, -0.609) -> (-0.457 -0.305 -0.609 -0.609)/4 = -0.495\n   hour19: (-0.457, -0.396, -0.579, -0.853) -> (-0.457 -0.396 -0.579 -0.853)/4 = -0.57125\n   hour20: (-0.548, -0.426, -0.487, -0.701) -> (-0.548 -0.426 -0.487 -0.701)/4 = -0.5405\n   hour21: (-0.548, -0.579, -0.579, -0.670) -> (-0.548 -0.579 -0.579 -0.670)/4 = -0.594\n   hour22: (-0.426, -0.670, -0.487, -0.701) -> (-0.426 -0.670 -0.487 -0.701)/4 = -0.571\n   hour23: (-0.457, -0.548, -0.670, -0.792) -> (-0.457 -0.548 -0.670 -0.792)/4 = -0.61675\n\n Now, we will create the next 96 hours:\n\n   Day1: 2017-06-22: from hour00 to hour23 -> use the 24 averages we computed above.\n   Day2: 2017-06-23: same 24 averages.\n   Day3: 2017-06-24: same 24 averages.\n   Day4: 2017-06-25: same 24 averages.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for the next 96 hours is the same 24 numbers repeated 4 times.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing values. We are to provide the complete data.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n   Start date: 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n   Then add one hour until 96 hours.\n\n We'll create a list of 96 entries:\n\n   [ (2017-06-22 00:00:00, -0.6395),\n     (2017-06-22 01:00:00, -0.647),\n     ... until 23:00:00 of 2017-06-22 with the 24 values,\n     then 2017-06-23 00:00:00: -0.6395, ... and so on.\n\n We must format the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input? The input has 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the input has negative values and we computed averages that are more precise. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the problem does not specify rounding. We'll keep the same precision as the input? The input has 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll round the average to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's recalc and round:\n\n   hour00: -0.6395 -> -0.640\n   hour01: -0.647 -> -0.647 (but we have to round to 3 decimals: -0.647 is already 3 decimals? Actually, -0.647 has 3 decimal places? \n        But note: -0.647 is -0.6470, so it's 3 decimal places. However, we computed -0.647 which is the same as -0.647.\n\n   But let's do:\n\n        hour00: -0.6395 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            -0.6395: the fourth decimal is 5 -> round up: -0.640\n\n        hour01: -0.647 -> already 3 decimals?
