        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hours of data from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00 (4 days * 24 hours = 96 records).\n However, note that from 2016-12-05 07:00:00 onwards, the data is 0.000. This might indicate missing data or a transformer shutdown.\n\n The task: Forecast the next 96 recorded dates (i.e., the next 96 hours) for the MUFL (Middle UseFul Load).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a period of 24 hours (daily seasonality) but the last 65 hours (from 2016-12-05 07:00) are zeros. \n    might be a data collection issue. We have to decide how to handle the zeros.\n\n 2. Since the zeros are consecutive and start at 2016-12-05 07:00 and continue until the end of the provided data, we cannot simply \n    use the entire series as is. We must consider if the zeros are missing values or actual measurements.\n\n 3. The problem states: \"these data will have missing values\". Therefore, the zeros from 2016-12-05 07:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00 are \n    likely missing data (or perhaps the transformer was offline). However, we are to forecast the next 96 hours.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    a. We can treat the zeros as missing and impute them. But note: the zeros start at a specific time and continue. This might be a \n       long stretch of missingness. Alternatively, we might consider that the transformer was down and then came back? But we don't know.\n\n    b. Since we are forecasting, we need to use the available non-zero data (which is the first 31 hours: from 2016-12-04 00:00 to 2016-12-05 06:00) \n       and then the rest is missing.\n\n    c. However, 31 hours is very little to capture daily seasonality. We have about 1.3 days of non-zero data.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days) ahead, we must use a method that can handle the missing data and \n    still provide a forecast.\n\n 6. We can use an approach that:\n    - First, we impute the missing values (the zeros) in the training data. But note: the zeros are from 2016-12-05 07:00 to the end of the training data (2016-12-07 23:00). \n      We have 65 consecutive zeros. We cannot simply impute without a model.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can model the time series only on the first 31 non-zero points? But that is very short.\n\n 7. Considering the above, we might assume that the zeros are not typical and that the transformer was offline. Therefore, for forecasting, \n    we are to predict the load when the transformer is back online? But the problem does not specify.\n\n 8. Since the problem says \"missing values\", we can try to fill the missing values (the zeros) by using the available data. However, note that \n    the zeros are the majority of the data (65 out of 96). This is a challenge.\n\n 9. We can use a simple method: \n    - Use the non-missing part (first 31 points) to compute the daily pattern. Since we have about 1.3 days, we can take the first 24 hours as a base pattern.\n\n    - Then, for the missing part (from 2016-12-05 07:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00) we can repeat the pattern of the first day (2016-12-04) but starting from 07:00 of the next day? \n      But note: the first day ends at 23:00 and then the next day starts at 00:00. However, we have data for 2016-12-05 00:00 to 06:00 (which is non-zero) and then zeros.\n\n    - Actually, the non-zero data we have:\n         2016-12-04 00:00 to 23:00: 24 hours\n         2016-12-05 00:00 to 06:00: 7 hours\n\n    - We can form a complete day for 2016-12-04 and then for 2016-12-05 we have the first 7 hours. Then we have zeros from 07:00 to 23:00 of 2016-12-05 and the next two days (2016-12-06 and 2016-12-07) are all zeros.\n\n 10. We are to forecast the next 96 hours, which would be from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n\n 11. How to handle the missing data in the training set? We can impute the missing values (the zeros) by:\n     - Using the same hour from the previous day (if available). But note that the previous day (2016-12-04) has data for all 24 hours, and then for 2016-12-05 we have the first 7 hours. \n       For 2016-12-05 07:00: we can use the value from 2016-12-04 07:00 (which is 12.402) and so on.\n\n     - But then for 2016-12-06 and 2016-12-07, we can use the same pattern from 2016-12-04? \n\n     However, note that the problem says \"missing values\", so we are allowed to impute.\n\n 12. Steps for imputation of the training set:\n     We create a complete dataset for the 96 hours (from 2016-12-04 00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00) by:\n        - Keeping the non-zero values (the first 31 points) as is.\n        - For the missing values (from 2016-12-05 07:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00), we use the value from the same hour of the base day (2016-12-04). \n          For example:\n            2016-12-05 07:00 -> use 2016-12-04 07:00 (12.402)\n            2016-12-05 08:00 -> use 2016-12-04 08:00 (7.214)\n            ... until 2016-12-05 23:00 -> use 2016-12-04 23:00 (5.615)\n\n        Then for 2016-12-06 00:00: use 2016-12-04 00:00 (10.625) and so on for the entire day of 2016-12-06 and 2016-12-07.\n\n     This will give us a complete dataset of 96 hours with a repeated daily pattern.\n\n 13. Then we can use this complete dataset to forecast the next 96 hours (which would be 4 days). Since the pattern is daily, we can simply use the same daily pattern for the next 4 days?\n\n     But note: the next 96 hours are from 2016-12-08 00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00. We can forecast by repeating the base day (2016-12-04) for these 4 days.\n\n 14. However, we must note that the base day is 2016-12-04 (a Sunday) and the next days are:\n        2016-12-08: Thursday\n        2016-12-09: Friday\n        2016-12-10: Saturday\n        2016-12-11: Sunday\n\n     But we only have one day of pattern (Sunday, 2016-12-04). We don't have data for other weekdays. Therefore, we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 15. Given the very limited data, the best we can do is to assume that the pattern repeats daily. So we will use the base day (2016-12-04) for every day in the forecast.\n\n 16. Therefore, the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the same as the base day (2016-12-04) repeated 4 times.\n\n 17. But note: the base day is 2016-12-04, which is a Sunday. The next 4 days start from Thursday (2016-12-08) to Sunday (2016-12-11). \n     However, without any other data, we cannot adjust for the day of the week. So we will use the same pattern.\n\n 18. Steps for the base day (2016-12-04) has 24 values. We will repeat these 24 values 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n 19. The forecast dates:\n        Start: 2016-12-08 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-12-08 01:00:00, ... until 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n\n 20. The values for the first 24 hours (2016-12-08) will be the same as 2016-12-04, the next 24 (2016-12-09) same, etc.\n\n 21. Therefore, the forecast:\n\n        date                 MUFL\n        2016-12-08 00:00:00 10.625\n        2016-12-08 01:00:00 11.975\n        2016-12-08 02:00:00 11.513\n        ... until\n        2016-12-08 23:00:00 5.615\n\n        then \n        2016-12-09 00:00:00 10.625\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. However, note that the last day in the training set (after imputation) for 2016-12-07 would have been the same as 2016-12-04. \n     But we are forecasting the next 4 days (2016-12-08 to 2016-12-11) so we just repeat the base day 4 times.\n\n 23. But wait: the training data we have for 2016-12-05 00:00 to 06:00 is non-zero and different from the base day (2016-12-04). \n     However, we are going to ignore that because we are using the base day for imputation and then for forecasting we are using the base day.\n\n     Why? Because we don't have a full day for 2016-12-05 (only 7 hours) and we don't have any other full day. So we rely on the only complete day we have: 2016-12-04.\n\n 24. This is a simple and reasonable approach given the data limitations.\n\n 25. Therefore, we will generate the next 96 hours by repeating the base day (2016-12-04) 4 times.\n\n 26. The base day values (2016-12-04) are:\n\n        00:00: 10.625\n        01:00: 11.975\n        02:00: 11.513\n        03:00: 10.270\n        04:00: 11.016\n        05:00: 11.655\n        06:00: 11.051\n        07:00: 12.402\n        08:00: 7.214\n        09:00: 5.650\n        10:00: 5.686\n        11:00: 6.183\n        12:00: 4.442\n        13:00: 5.899\n        14:00: 6.183\n        15:00: 6.361\n        16:00: 5.259\n        17:00: 5.721\n        18:00: 5.366\n        19:00: 5.082\n        20:00: 4.158\n        21:00: 3.696\n        22:00: 4.904\n        23:00: 5.615\n\n 27. We will repeat this pattern 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n 28. Format the answer as required.\n\n 29. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 30. The dates: \n        Start: 2016-12-08 00:00:00\n        Then we add 1 hour until we have 96 records.\n\n 31. We generate the dates programmatically? But since we are writing the answer, we can write a loop in our mind.\n\n 32. We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n        date                 MUFL\n        2016-12-08 00:00:00 10.625\n        2016-12-08 01:00:00 11.975\n        ... \n        (4 times the base day)\n\n 33. Let's do it step by step for 4 days.\n\n 34. We note: the base day has 24 hours. We'll write the first day (2016-12-08) with the base day values, then the second day (2016-12-09) with the same values, etc.\n\n 35. We must be cautious: the base day is 2016-12-04, which is a Sunday. The forecasted days are:\n        Day 1: 2016-12-08 (Thursday) -> use base Sunday pattern?\n        But we have no alternative.\n\n 36. Given the above, we proceed.\n\n 37. Code for generating the forecast (pseudocode):\n\n        base_values = [10.625, 11.975, 11.513, 10.270, 11.016, 11.655, 11.051, 12.402, 7.214, 5.650, 5.686, 6.183, 4.442, 5.899, 6.183, 6.361, 5.259, 5.721, 5.366, 5.082, 4.158, 3.696, 4.904, 5.615]\n\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 12, 8, 0, 0, 0)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                value = base_values[hour]\n                print(f\"{date} {value}\")\n\n 38. But note: the base_values are in the order of the day.\n\n 39. We write the dates in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 40. The first date: 2016-12-08 00:00:00 -> base_values[0] = 10.625\n        then 2016-12-08 01:00:00 -> base_values[1] = 11.975\n        ... until 2016-12-08 23:00:00 -> base_values[23] = 5.615\n\n        then 2016-12-09 00:00:00 -> base_values[0] = 10.625\n        and so on.\n\n 41. We output 96 lines.\n\n 42. However, note that the problem says the data is sampled hourly. So we are generating hourly data.\n\n 43. Let's write the answer accordingly.\n\n 44. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We keep the same.\n\n 45. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns, with the date string and the float value.\n\n 46. We must not use any rounding, we use the exact base values.\n\n 47. The answer:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-12-08 00:00:00 10.625\n        2016-12-08 01:00:00 11.975\n        2016-12-08 02:00:00 11.513\n        2016-12-08 03:00:00 10.270\n        2016-12-08 04:00:00 11.016\n        2016-12-08 05:00:00 11.655\n        2016-12-08 06:00:00 11.051\n        2016-12-08 07:00:00 12.402\n        2016-12-08 08:00:00 7.214\n        2016-12-08 09:00:00 5.650\n        2016-12-08 10:00:00 5.686\n        2016-12-08 11:00:00 6.183\n        2016-12-08 12:00:00 4.442\n        2016-12-08 13:00:00 5.899\n        2016-12-08 14:00:00 6.183\n        2016-12-08 15:00:00 6.361\n        2016-12-08 16:00:00 5.259\n        2016-12-08 17:00:00 5.721\n        2016-12-08 18:00:00 5.366\n        2016-12-08 19:00:00 5.082\n        2016-12-08 20:00:00 4.158\n        2016-12-08 21:00:00 3.696\n        2016-12-08 22:00:00 4.904\n        2016-12-08 23:00:00 5.615\n        2016-12-09 00:00:00 10.625\n        ... (repeat 3 more times)\n\n 48. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 49. We count: 24 * 4 = 96.\n\n 50. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 51. However, note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning the next 96 hours after the last point in the training set. \n     The last point in the training set is 2016-12-07 23:00:00. So the next 96 hours start at 2016-12-08 00:00:00 and end at 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n\n 52. We are confident in this approach given the data limitations.\n\n 53. Let's output the answer.\n",
