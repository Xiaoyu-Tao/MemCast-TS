        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values in the dataset. However, for forecasting, we must handle the given data appropriately.\n\n 2. Since the data is time series with hourly frequency, we can use time series forecasting methods. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we might consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not captured.\n    - We can use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple naive seasonal method.\n\n 3. However, note that the data shows:\n    - A daily pattern: for example, on 2017-09-26, the values are negative during the day and become less negative or positive at night? But the pattern is not very clear.\n\n 4. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to forecast 96 points, we can use a simple method: \n    - We can use the last 24 hours (one day) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that might be too naive and we see that the pattern changes.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an average of the past 4 days for each hour? But note: the data is only 4 days.\n\n 6. Let's break the data by hour of the day and compute the average for each hour across the 4 days? Then use that average pattern for the next 4 days? But we have to account for the trend? The data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days.\n\n 7. However, looking at the data, the last day (2017-09-29) has a different pattern? For example, at 22:00 it has 0.995, which is positive, while the previous days at 22:00 were negative.\n\n 8. Given the ambiguity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a daily pattern and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 9. Steps for the last 4 days (96 hours) we have 4 observations for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00). We can compute the mean for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 10. But note: the data starts at 2017-09-26 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-09-29 23:00:00. So we have exactly 4 full days.\n\n 11. We can group by hour and take the mean. However, we must be cautious: if there is a trend, we might want to adjust. But for simplicity, we use the mean.\n\n 12. Then, for the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00), we will use the computed mean for each hour.\n\n 13. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? So we can proceed.\n\n 14. But what if the next 96 hours have missing values? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but it refers to the provided data? Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" - meaning the provided data? But the provided data we have is complete. So we don't need to impute for the historical data.\n\n 15. For the forecast period, we are to provide the complete data. So we are generating 96 points without missing values.\n\n 16. Therefore, we will:\n     - Extract the 4 days of data.\n     - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (starting from 2017-09-30 00:00:00), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 17. Why this method? It's simple and captures the daily seasonality. Given the short history, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 18. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n     Hour 00: (-0.569 + 0.391 + -0.391 + -0.426) / 4 = (-0.569+0.391-0.391-0.426)/4 = (-0.995)/4 = -0.24875\n     Hour 01: (0.036 + -0.320 + 0.000 + -0.426) / 4 = (0.036-0.320+0-0.426)/4 = (-0.71)/4 = -0.1775\n     ... and so on.\n\n 19. But note: the last day (2017-09-29) has 24 hours? Yes, from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n 20. We'll compute the mean for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then, we generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the 24-hour mean pattern 4 times.\n\n 22. The dates will be:\n     2017-09-30 00:00:00, 2017-09-30 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-03 23:00:00.\n\n 23. We must output the data in the same format: two columns, 'date' and 'MULL'.\n\n 24. Since the problem requires the complete data and we must not omit any content, we will output 96 lines.\n\n 25. However, note: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 time points? Yes, 96 hours.\n\n 26. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n     Hour 0: [ -0.569,  0.391, -0.391, -0.426] -> mean = (-0.569+0.391-0.391-0.426)/4 = (-0.995)/4 = -0.24875\n     Hour 1: [0.036, -0.320, 0.000, -0.426] -> (0.036-0.320+0-0.426)/4 = (-0.71)/4 = -0.1775\n     Hour 2: [0.249, 0.320, -0.249, -0.426] -> (0.249+0.320-0.249-0.426)/4 = (-0.106)/4 = -0.0265\n     Hour 3: [-0.142, -0.284, -0.249, -0.426] -> (-0.142-0.284-0.249-0.426)/4 = (-1.101)/4 = -0.27525\n     Hour 4: [-0.959, -1.350, -0.533, -0.426] -> (-0.959-1.350-0.533-0.426)/4 = (-3.268)/4 = -0.817\n     Hour 5: [-1.244, -0.107, -0.391, -0.426] -> (-1.244-0.107-0.391-0.426)/4 = (-2.168)/4 = -0.542\n     Hour 6: [-2.274, -1.421, -0.569, -0.426] -> (-2.274-1.421-0.569-0.426)/4 = (-4.69)/4 = -1.1725\n     Hour 7: [-0.142, -1.173, -0.391, -0.391] -> (-0.142-1.173-0.391-0.391)/4 = (-2.097)/4 = -0.52425\n     Hour 8: [-0.782, -0.497, -0.320, -0.320] -> (-0.782-0.497-0.320-0.320)/4 = (-1.919)/4 = -0.47975\n     Hour 9: [-1.883, -0.746, -0.249, 0.426] -> (-1.883-0.746-0.249+0.426)/4 = (-2.452)/4 = -0.613\n     Hour 10: [-1.564, -0.391, 0.000, 0.284] -> (-1.564-0.391+0+0.284)/4 = (-1.671)/4 = -0.41775\n     Hour 11: [-1.279, -0.391, 0.036, 0.817] -> (-1.279-0.391+0.036+0.817)/4 = (-0.817)/4 = -0.20425\n     Hour 12: [0.320, -2.772, 3.234, 0.569] -> (0.320-2.772+3.234+0.569)/4 = (1.351)/4 = 0.33775\n     Hour 13: [-1.883, -2.025, 3.589, 0.142] -> (-1.883-2.025+3.589+0.142)/4 = (-0.177)/4 = -0.04425\n     Hour 14: [-1.564, -1.208, 3.234, 0.178] -> (-1.564-1.208+3.234+0.178)/4 = (0.64)/4 = 0.16\n     Hour 15: [0.142, -2.594, 1.173, -0.178] -> (0.142-2.594+1.173-0.178)/4 = (-1.457)/4 = -0.36425\n     Hour 16: [-1.066, -2.487, 0.746, -0.320] -> (-1.066-2.487+0.746-0.320)/4 = (-3.127)/4 = -0.78175\n     Hour 17: [-1.350, -2.843, -0.249, -0.391] -> (-1.350-2.843-0.249-0.391)/4 = (-4.833)/4 = -1.20825\n     Hour 18: [-3.056, -3.163, -1.066, -0.711] -> (-3.056-3.163-1.066-0.711)/4 = (-7.996)/4 = -1.999\n     Hour 19: [-2.559, -3.127, -0.426, -0.533] -> (-2.559-3.127-0.426-0.533)/4 = (-6.645)/4 = -1.66125\n     Hour 20: [-2.665, -3.340, -0.426, 0.000] -> (-2.665-3.340-0.426+0)/4 = (-6.431)/4 = -1.60775\n     Hour 21: [-2.416, -2.665, -0.426, 0.107] -> (-2.416-2.665-0.426+0.107)/4 = (-5.4)/4 = -1.35\n     Hour 22: [-1.954, -2.381, -0.426, 0.995] -> (-1.954-2.381-0.426+0.995)/4 = (-3.766)/4 = -0.9415\n     Hour 23: [-0.533, -0.213, -0.426, 1.812] -> (-0.533-0.213-0.426+1.812)/4 = (0.64)/4 = 0.16\n\n 27. Now, we create the next 4 days (from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00) by repeating the above 24 means in order for 4 times.\n\n 28. The dates: \n      Day 1: 2017-09-30 (starting at 00:00:00, then 2017-10-01, 2017-10-02, 2017-10-03.\n\n 29. We must generate the dates correctly. The last given date is 2017-09-29 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-09-30 00:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 31. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-30 00:00:00 -0.24875\n2017-09-30 01:00:00 -0.1775\n...\n2017-10-03 23:00:00 0.16\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 32. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimal places to match.\n\n 33. However, the problem does not specify the precision. But the input has 3 decimal places. So we round the means to 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n     Hour 0: -0.24875 -> -0.249\n     Hour 1: -0.1775 -> -0.178\n     Hour 2: -0.0265 -> -0.027\n     Hour 3: -0.27525 -> -0.275\n     Hour 4: -0.817 -> -0.817\n     Hour 5: -0.542 -> -0.542\n     Hour 6: -1.1725 -> -1.173\n     Hour 7: -0.52425 -> -0.524\n     Hour 8: -0.47975 -> -0.480\n     Hour 9: -0.613 -> -0.613\n     Hour 10: -0.41775 -> -0.418\n     Hour 11: -0.20425 -> -0.204\n     Hour 12: 0.33775 -> 0.338\n     Hour 13: -0.04425 -> -0.044\n     Hour 14: 0.16 -> 0.160\n     Hour 15: -0.36425 -> -0.364\n     Hour 16: -0.78175 -> -0.782\n     Hour 17: -1.20825 -> -1.208\n     Hour 18: -1.999 -> -1.999\n     Hour 19: -1.66125 -> -1.661\n     Hour 20: -1.60775 -> -1.608\n     Hour 21: -1.35 -> -1.350\n     But note: -1.35 is -1.350 -> so we write -1.350\n     Hour 22: -0.9415 -> -0.942\n     Hour 23: 0.16 -> 0.160\n\n 35. Now, we write the next 4 days with these 24 values repeated.\n\n 36. We must be cautious: the first day of forecast is 2017-09-30, then 2017-10-01, 2017-10-02, 2017-10-03.\n\n 37. Let's generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-09-30 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-09-30 01:00:00 ... until 2017-09-30 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n     Then 2017-10-01 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-01 23:00:00 -> next 24\n     Then 2017-10-02 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-02 23:00:00 -> next 24\n     Then 2017-10-03 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-03 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 38. We output the MULL values for:\n       2017-09-30 00:00:00: -0.249\n       2017-09-30 01:00:00: -0.178\n       ... \n       2017-09-30 23:00:00: 0.160\n       2017-10-01 00:00:00: -0.249\n       2017-10-01 01:00:00: -0.178\n       ... and so on.\n\n 39. We'll write the data in the format.\n\n 40. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 41. We are generating 96 lines.\n\n 42. Let's code the output.\n\n 43. We'll write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 44. However, note: the original data had the date format as \"2017-09-26 00:00:00\", so we use the same.\n\n 45. We'll generate the dates using a loop.\n\n 46. But since we are writing by hand, we can write the first day and then repeat the same pattern for the next days? Actually, we have the 24 values for the day, and we repeat 4 times.\n\n 47. We'll list the 24 values for the day:\n\n        hour0: -0.249\n        hour1: -0.178\n        hour2: -0.027\n        hour3: -0.275\n        hour4: -0.817\n        hour5: -0.542\n        hour6: -1.173\n        hour7: -0.524\n        hour8: -0.480\n        hour9: -0.613\n        hour10: -0.418\n        hour11: -0.204\n        hour12: 0.338\n        hour13: -0.044\n        hour14: 0.160\n        hour15: -0.364\n        hour16: -0.782\n        hour17: -1.208\n        hour18: -1.999\n        hour19: -1.661\n        hour20: -1.608\n        hour21: -1.350\n        hour22: -0.942\n        hour23: 0.160\n\n 48.
