        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) metric.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we have consecutive hourly data without gaps. So we can proceed by assuming the given data is complete for modeling.\n\n 3. We must choose a forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 steps (4 days) ahead, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Daily seasonality (since we see a pattern repeating every 24 hours)\n    - Possibly an autoregressive component.\n\n 4. Given the data length is short, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data might have non-constant variance or non-stationarity. We should check for stationarity and apply differencing if needed.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple method like a seasonal naive forecast (using the last available day as the forecast for the next 4 days) but that might not capture trends.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the short history, we can try to fit a model that uses:\n    - Trend (if any) and seasonality.\n\n 8. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, which can handle seasonality and trend.\n\n 9. Steps for ExponentialSmoothing:\n    - We have hourly data and a clear daily pattern (24 hours). So we set seasonal_periods=24.\n    - We can try additive or multiplicative seasonality. Since the variation seems proportional to the level (looking at the data: values during the day are higher and at night lower, and the magnitude of variation is similar each day), additive might be appropriate.\n\n 10. But note: the data has negative values? Yes, there are negative values (e.g., -0.804). Therefore, multiplicative seasonality is not appropriate because it requires positive data. So we use additive.\n\n 11. We'll fit an ExponentialSmoothing model with:\n     - additive trend (if any) and additive seasonality.\n\n 12. However, with only 4 days, the model might not capture a long-term trend. We can try without trend (damped or not) or with additive trend.\n\n 13. We'll try to fit with additive trend and additive seasonality.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: use the average of each hour across the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend and also the last day might be more relevant.\n\n 15. Given the short history, we can also consider a naive seasonal forecast: use the last day (2017-08-04) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 identical days. Alternatively, we can average the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 16. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     hour0: (3.014 + 1.608 + 3.014 + 2.076) / 4 = (3.014+1.608+3.014+2.076)/4 = 9.712/4 = 2.428\n     ... and so on.\n\n 17. Then the forecast for the next 4 days would be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 18. However, we note that the data does not stabilized in 4 days? The first day (2017-08-01) and the last day (2017-08-04) are different. But without a clear trend, averaging might be safe.\n\n 19. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not seeing any in the provided 96 points. So we can use the average.\n\n 20. However, let's look at the data: \n      The values on 2017-08-01: max 3.885, min -0.268\n      The values on 2017-08-04: max 4.153, min 0.268\n\n     There might be a slight upward trend? But 4 days is too short to tell.\n\n 21. Considering the requirement for 96 points and the simplicity, we can use the average by hour.\n\n 22. Steps for average by hour:\n      Group the 96 points by the hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n 23. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 24. This method is simple and handles the seasonality.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the median to be robust to outliers? But the data doesn't show extreme outliers.\n\n 26. Let's compute the hourly average:\n\n      hour0: [3.014, 1.608, 3.014, 2.076] -> mean = (3.014+1.608+3.014+2.076)/4 = 2.428\n      hour1: [2.277, 1.005, 1.808, 1.206] -> (2.277+1.005+1.808+1.206)/4 = 1.574\n      hour2: [1.875, 1.407, 1.674, 2.009] -> (1.875+1.407+1.674+2.009)/4 = 1.74125\n      hour3: [1.206, 0.067, 1.340, 1.942] -> (1.206+0.067+1.340+1.942)/4 = 1.13875\n      hour4: [1.407, 0.938, 1.808, 1.407] -> (1.407+0.938+1.808+1.407)/4 = 1.390\n      hour5: [1.674, 0.670, 1.942, 1.139] -> (1.674+0.670+1.942+1.139)/4 = 1.35625\n      hour6: [1.139, 1.072, 2.143, 1.741] -> (1.139+1.072+2.143+1.741)/4 = 1.52375\n      hour7: [1.340, 1.407, 1.674, 2.277] -> (1.340+1.407+1.674+2.277)/4 = 1.6745\n      hour8: [1.273, 0.536, 1.608, 1.541] -> (1.273+0.536+1.608+1.541)/4 = 1.2395\n      hour9: [1.541, 1.139, 1.942, 2.813] -> (1.541+1.139+1.942+2.813)/4 = 1.85875\n      hour10: [1.541, 0.804, 1.741, 3.617] -> (1.541+0.804+1.741+3.617)/4 = 1.92575\n      hour11: [1.808, 1.340, 2.076, 4.153] -> (1.808+1.340+2.076+4.153)/4 = 2.34425\n      hour12: [2.880, 0.670, 1.808, 3.282] -> (2.880+0.670+1.808+3.282)/4 = 2.16\n      hour13: [3.885, 0.335, 4.689, 1.407] -> (3.885+0.335+4.689+1.407)/4 = 2.579\n      hour14: [2.143, 0.737, 3.684, 2.679] -> (2.143+0.737+3.684+2.679)/4 = 2.31075\n      hour15: [1.608, 0.670, 2.411, 0.871] -> (1.608+0.670+2.411+0.871)/4 = 1.39\n      hour16: [1.340, 0.335, 0.335, 1.741] -> (1.340+0.335+0.335+1.741)/4 = 0.93775\n      hour17: [1.206, 0.469, 0.201, 1.072] -> (1.206+0.469+0.201+1.072)/4 = 0.737\n      hour18: [0.603, -0.067, -0.268, 0.402] -> (0.603-0.067 -0.268+0.402)/4 = 0.1675\n      hour19: [-0.268, -0.804, -0.402, 0.268] -> (-0.268-0.804-0.402+0.268)/4 = -0.3015\n      hour20: [0.536, -0.469, 0.134, 1.608] -> (0.536-0.469+0.134+1.608)/4 = 0.45225\n      hour21: [0.000, -1.608, -0.134, 1.340] -> (0.000-1.608-0.134+1.340)/4 = -0.1005\n      hour22: [1.072, 0.335, 0.134, 1.541] -> (1.072+0.335+0.134+1.541)/4 = 0.7705\n      hour23: [0.402, 1.741, 0.670, 1.875] -> (0.402+1.741+0.670+1.875)/4 = 1.172\n\n 27. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) will be:\n\n      Day1 (2017-08-05): [2.428, 1.574, 1.741, ... , 1.172] (24 values)\n      Day2 (2017-08-06): same 24 values\n      Day3 (2017-08-07): same\n      Day4 (2017-08-08): same\n\n 28. But note: the last given data point is at 2017-08-04 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours start at 2017-08-05 00:00:00 and end at 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 30. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to model a trend. The average by hour is a safe baseline.\n\n 31. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. But given the constraints (only 4 days of data) and the requirement to produce 96 points, the average by hour is a common approach.\n\n 32. We'll output the forecast as the average for each hour of the day, repeated for 4 days.\n\n 33. Format: \n        date and time (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) and the HULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 34. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-05 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 35. The hourly averages we computed:\n\n        hour0: 2.428\n        hour1: 1.574\n        hour2: 1.741\n        hour3: 1.139\n        hour4: 1.390\n        hour5: 1.356\n        hour6: 1.524\n        hour7: 1.675\n        hour8: 1.240\n        hour9: 1.859\n        hour10: 1.926\n        hour11: 2.344\n        hour12: 2.160\n        hour13: 2.579\n        hour14: 2.311\n        hour15: 1.390\n        hour16: 0.938\n        hour17: 0.737\n        hour18: 0.168\n        hour19: -0.302\n        hour20: 0.452\n        hour21: -0.101\n        hour22: 0.771\n        hour23: 1.172\n\n 36. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n        First day (2017-08-05): \n          00:00:00 -> 2.428\n          01:00:00 -> 1.574\n          02:00:00 -> 1.741\n          ... until 23:00:00 -> 1.172\n\n        Second day (2017-08-06): same pattern\n        Third day (2017-08-07): same\n        Fourth day (2017-08-08): same\n\n 38. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 39. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting without gaps. We are to provide 96 points without missing values.\n\n 40. We'll output the data in the required format.\n\n 41. Let's code the output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-05 00:00:00  2.428\n2017-08-05 01:00:00  1.574\n2017-08-05 02:00:00  1.741\n2017-08-05 03:00:00  1.139\n2017-08-05 04:00:00  1.390\n2017-08-05 05:00:00  1.356\n2017-08-05 06:00:00  1.524\n2017-08-05 07:00:00  1.675\n2017-08-05 08:00:00  1.240\n2017-08-05 09:00:00  1.859\n2017-08-05 10:00:00  1.926\n2017-08-05 11:00:00  2.344\n2017-08-05 12:00:00  2.160\n2017-08-05 13:00:00  2.579\n2017-08-05 14:00:00  2.311\n2017-08-05 15:00:00  1.390\n2017-08-05 16:00:00  0.938\n2017-08-05 17:00:00  0.737\n2017-08-05 18:00:00  0.168\n2017-08-05 19:00:00 -0.302\n2017-08-05 20:00:00  0.452\n2017-08-05 21:00:00 -0.101\n2017-08-05 22:00:00  0.771\n2017-08-05 23:00:00  1.172\n2017-08-06 00:00:00  2.428\n2017-08-06 01:00:00  1.574\n... and so on for two more days.\n\n 42. We'll generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 43. We note that the last day of the forecast is 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n\n 44. We write the data in the exact format.\n\n 45. However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places. We'll keep the same precision.\n\n 46. We'll output the numbers as they are (with 3 decimal places) as we did in the averages.\n\n 47. But note: we computed the averages and then rounded to 3 decimal places? Actually, we computed and then we should round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. Let me recompute and round each to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: 2.428 -> 2.428\n        hour1: 1.574 -> 1.574\n        hour2: 1.74125 -> 1.741\n        hour3: 1.13875 -> 1.139\n        hour4: 1.390 -> 1.390\n        hour5: 1.35625 -> 1.356\n        hour6: 1.52375 -> 1.524\n        hour7: 1.6745 -> 1.675\n        hour8: 1.2395 -> 1.240\n        hour9: 1.85875 -> 1.859\n        hour10: 1.92575 -> 1.926\n        hour11: 2.34425 -> 2.344\n        hour12: 2.16 -> 2.160\n        hour13: 2.579 -> 2.579\n        hour14: 2.31075 -> 2.311\n        hour15: 1.39 -> 1.390   (we had 1.39, but we computed as 1.39? Actually: (1.608+0.670+2.411+0.871)=5.56, 5.56/4=1.390 -> 1.390)\n        hour16: 0.93775 -> 0.938\n        hour17: 0.737 -> 0.737\n        hour18: 0.1675 -> 0.168\n        hour19: -0.3015 -> -0.302\n        hour20: 0.45225 -> 0.452\n        hour21: -0.1005 -> -0.101\n        hour22: 0.7705 -> 0.771\n        hour23: 1.172 -> 1.172\n\n 49.
