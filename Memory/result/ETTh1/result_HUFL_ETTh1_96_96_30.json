        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the data has missing value pattern: the entire day (2016-10-31) has constant value 11.320? \n But we are not asked to impute the past, only to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we must choose an appropriate model. Given the hourly data and the presence of potential seasonality (daily, weekly) and the short history (only 4 days), we can consider:\n\n Approach:\n 1. We note that the data has a daily pattern (24 hours). The data from 2016-10-29 to 2016-10-30 and 2016-11-01 show variation, but 2016-10-31 is constant. This constant might be an anomaly or missing data pattern? But we are to forecast future.\n\n 2. We can use a simple model that captures the daily seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we might use:\n    - A seasonal naive model: forecast each hour of the same hour in the previous day? But the constant day might break the pattern.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the available non-constant days? But note: the last day (2016-11-01) is non-constant and the first two days (2016-10-29 and 2016-10-30) are non-constant.\n\n 3. However, the problem says there are missing values. We are not asked to handle the past missing values for the training data? We are only forecasting the future.\n\n 4. We are to produce 96 future points. We can use a model that is robust to the constant day. Let's consider:\n\n    Option A: Use the last available day (2016-11-01) as the pattern for the next day? But that might not capture the weekly pattern? We don't have enough data for weekly.\n\n    Option B: Compute the average of each hour of the day for the non-constant days (i.e., 2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, 2016-11-01) and then use that as the daily pattern for the next 4 days? But note: 2016-10-31 is constant and we skip it? \n\n    However, the next 96 hours are 4 days. We can repeat the daily pattern 4 times? But we don't know if there is a trend? The data is too short to see a trend.\n\n 5. Steps for a simple average model:\n\n    - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) for the non-constant days (excluding 2016-10-31).\n    - For each hour, compute the mean of the values at that hour from the non-constant days.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 6. But note: the constant day (2016-10-31) might be an error? We are not using it for the pattern.\n\n 7. How many non-constant days? \n        Day 1: 2016-10-29 (Saturday) -> 24 hours\n        Day 2: 2016-10-30 (Sunday) -> 24 hours\n        Day 3: 2016-10-31 (Monday) -> constant -> skip\n        Day 4: 2016-11-01 (Tuesday) -> 24 hours\n\n    So we have 3 days of non-constant data.\n\n 8. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n    Hour 0: (13.195 + 7.569 + 10.985) / 3 = (13.195+7.569+10.985)=31.749 -> 10.583\n    Hour 1: (12.458 + 7.100 + 10.918) / 3 = (12.458+7.100+10.918)=30.476 -> 10.1587\n    ... and so on.\n\n 9. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00) would be:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-11-02): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n        Day 2 (2016-11-03): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n        Day 3 (2016-11-04): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n        Day 4 (2016-11-05): [mean_0, mean_1, ..., mean_23]\n\n 10. But note: the data we have ends at 2016-11-01 23:00:00. The next day starts at 2016-11-02 00:00:00.\n\n 11. However, we must be cautious: the model is very simple and does not account for any trend or weekly pattern. But with only 3 days of non-constant data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we could use the last day (2016-11-01) as the pattern? But the problem says the data has missing values, and we are to forecast the next 96. We are not told to use a complex model.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, we choose the average of the three non-constant days for each hour.\n\n 14. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (13.195, 7.569, 10.985) -> mean = (13.195+7.569+10.985)/3 = 31.749/3 = 10.583\n      Hour 1: (12.458, 7.100, 10.918) -> 30.476/3 = 10.1587\n      Hour 2: (13.128, 8.239, 11.253) -> 32.62/3 = 10.8733\n      Hour 3: (12.793, 7.904, 10.516) -> 31.213/3 = 10.4043\n      Hour 4: (12.927, 8.506, 10.114) -> 31.547/3 = 10.5157\n      Hour 5: (13.396, 8.372, 10.315) -> 32.083/3 = 10.6943\n      Hour 6: (12.860, 9.444, 10.985) -> 33.289/3 = 11.0963\n      Hour 7: (16.343, 11.588, 8.707) -> 36.638/3 = 12.2127\n      Hour 8: (10.583, 9.712, 8.105) -> 28.4/3 = 9.4667\n      Hour 9: (9.176, 7.837, 6.363) -> 23.376/3 = 7.792\n      Hour 10: (9.310, 7.636, 7.435) -> 24.381/3 = 8.127\n      Hour 11: (10.047, 8.774, 7.971) -> 26.792/3 = 8.9307\n      Hour 12: (7.971, 6.631, 5.894) -> 20.496/3 = 6.832\n      Hour 13: (7.971, 6.765, 5.827) -> 20.563/3 = 6.8543\n      Hour 14: (7.435, 7.569, 4.689) -> 19.693/3 = 6.5643\n      Hour 15: (7.301, 7.703, 5.358) -> 20.362/3 = 6.7873\n      Hour 16: (7.234, 6.497, 5.023) -> 18.754/3 = 6.2513\n      Hour 17: (8.640, 8.038, 6.698) -> 23.376/3 = 7.792\n      Hour 18: (7.636, 7.435, 7.502) -> 22.573/3 = 7.5243\n      Hour 19: (6.765, 7.167, 6.832) -> 20.764/3 = 6.9213\n      Hour 20: (6.564, 5.626, 5.894) -> 18.084/3 = 6.028\n      Hour 21: (5.626, 4.622, 5.626) -> 15.874/3 = 5.2913\n      Hour 22: (6.564, 5.425, 4.622) -> 16.611/3 = 5.537\n      Hour 23: (6.028, 6.832, 5.425) -> 18.285/3 = 6.095\n\n 15. Now, we will generate the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-02 23:00:00: [10.583, 10.1587, 10.8733, 10.4043, 10.5157, 10.6943, 11.0963, 12.2127, 9.4667, 7.792, 8.127, 8.9307, 6.832, 6.8543, 6.5643, 6.7873, 6.2513, 7.792, 7.5243, 6.9213, 6.028, 5.2913, 5.537, 6.095]\n      Day 2: 2016-11-03 00:00:00 to 2016-11-03 23:00:00: same 24 values\n      Day 3: 2016-11-04 00:00:00 to 2016-11-04 23:00:00: same\n      Day 4: 2016-11-05 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00: same\n\n 16. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are forecasting the future and we are to provide the complete data. We are not missing any in the forecast period? We are generating all 96 points.\n\n 17. Format: We must output the next 96 dates and the forecasted HUFL. The dates are consecutive hourly from the last point.\n\n 18. The last date in the input is 2016-11-01 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-11-02 00:00:00.\n\n 19. We'll create the date range:\n\n        start: 2016-11-02 00:00:00\n        end: 2016-11-05 23:00:00\n\n 20. We'll write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL', with the HUFL values rounded to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n 21. We computed the averages and then we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 22. Let's round the averages:\n\n        Hour0: 10.583 -> 10.583\n        Hour1: 10.1587 -> 10.159\n        Hour2: 10.8733 -> 10.873\n        Hour3: 10.4043 -> 10.404\n        Hour4: 10.5157 -> 10.516\n        Hour5: 10.6943 -> 10.694\n        Hour6: 11.0963 -> 11.096\n        Hour7: 12.2127 -> 12.213\n        Hour8: 9.4667 -> 9.467\n        Hour9: 7.792 -> 7.792\n        Hour10: 8.127 -> 8.127\n        Hour11: 8.9307 -> 8.931\n        Hour12: 6.832 -> 6.832\n        Hour13: 6.8543 -> 6.854\n        Hour14: 6.5643 -> 6.564\n        Hour15: 6.7873 -> 6.787\n        Hour16: 6.2513 -> 6.251\n        Hour17: 7.792 -> 7.792\n        Hour18: 7.5243 -> 7.524\n        Hour19: 6.9213 -> 6.921\n        Hour20: 6.028 -> 6.028\n        Hour21: 5.2913 -> 5.291\n        Hour22: 5.537 -> 5.537\n        Hour23: 6.095 -> 6.095\n\n 23. Then the first day (2016-11-02) will have:\n\n        2016-11-02 00:00:00 10.583\n        2016-11-02 01:00:00 10.159\n        2016-11-02 02:00:00 10.873\n        ... and so on.\n\n 24. We'll repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 4 days.\n\n 25. However, note: the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given a snippet. We are not using the entire history? We are only using the last 96 points?\n     But the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", so we are using these 96 points to forecast the next 96.\n\n 26. We are aware that the constant day (2016-10-31) might be an anomaly, but we are excluding it from the pattern. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 27. Write the output in the required format.\n\n 28. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-02 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-02 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-05 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n 30. The HUFL values for each day are the same 24 numbers.\n\n 31. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-02 00:00:00 10.583\n2016-11-02 01:00:00 10.159\n2016-11-02 02:00:00 10.873\n...\n2016-11-05 23:00:00 6.095\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 32. We must not omit any content.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n   We have a list of 24 values for one day: \n        [10.583, 10.159, 10.873, 10.404, 10.516, 10.694, 11.096, 12.213, 9.467, 7.792, 8.127, 8.931, 6.832, 6.854, 6.564, 6.787, 6.251, 7.792, 7.524, 6.921, 6.028, 5.291, 5.537, 6.095]\n\n   Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 33. Generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 11, 2, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            hufl = pattern[i % 24]\n\n 34. But we are writing the answer in a text.\n\n However, note: we are not running code in the response, we are writing the data.\n\n 35. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 36. Let's do it step by step for the first day and then repeat.\n\n 37. We'll write the entire block.\n\n 38. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? We are not missing any in the forecast? We are generating all.\n\n 39. We output the data as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-02 00:00:00 10.583\n2016-11-02 01:00:00 10.159\n2016-11-02 02:00:00 10.873\n2016-11-02 03:00:00 10.404\n2016-11-02 04:00:00 10.516\n2016-11-02 05:00:00 10.694\n2016-11-02 06:00:00 11.096\n2016-11-02 07:00:00 12.213\n2016-11-02 08:00:00 9.467\n2016-11-02 09:00:00 7.792\n2016-11-02 10:00:00 8.127\n2016-11-02 11:00:00 8.931\n2016-11-02 12:00:00 6.832\n2016-11-02 13:00:00 6.854\n2016-11-02 14:00:00 6.564\n2016-11-02 15:00:00 6.787\n2016-11-02 16:00:00 6.251\n2016-11-02 17:00:00 7.792\n2016-11-02 18:00:00 7.524\n2016-11-02 19:00:00 6.921\n2016-11-02 20:00:00 6.028\n2016-11-02 21:00:00 5.291\n2016-11-02 22:00:00 5.537\n2016-11-02 23:00:00 6.095\n2016-11-03 00:00:00 10.583\n2016-11-03 01:00:00 10.159\n... until 2016-11-05 23:00:00\n\n```\n\n 40. We must be careful: the dates must be consecutive and correct.\n\n 41. We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 42. Since it's repetitive, we can generate the list and then write.\n\n 43. But in the response, we write the exact text.\n\n 44. We'll write the entire block.\n\n 45. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
