        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-04-07 00:00:00 to 2017-04-10 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided segment, there are no missing entries (we have 96 consecutive hours). So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we might have seasonality (daily pattern), we can consider a model that captures daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 4. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the need for 4 days of forecast, we can use a model that can handle seasonality and short-term dependencies.\n\n 5. We can use a simple seasonal model like Seasonal Naive, or more advanced models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS). However, with only 96 points, complex models might overfit.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a model that uses multiple seasonal patterns if we suspect intra-day patterns. But note: the data is hourly and we have 4 days, so we can only capture daily seasonality.\n\n 7. Let's observe the data: \n    - The values are fluctuating and seem to have a daily pattern (with some negative values at night and positive during the day? but note: the pattern is not very clear and there are negative values).\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can use a simple model: \n    Option 1 Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by taking the same hour of the last day. But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n    However, we only have 4 days, so we can do:\n\n    For hour h (0 to 23) in the next day, we can set:\n        forecast for day 5, hour h = average of day1_h, day2_h, day3_h, day4_h.\n\n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So we can use the last 4 days to form a daily pattern and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 9. However, the data might have a stable pattern? Let's check the last 4 days:\n\n    Day1: 2017-04-07: \n        00:00: 0.134, 01:00: 1.608, ... 23:00: 1.005\n    Day2: 2017-04-08: \n        00:00: 1.407, 23:00: 0.335\n    Day3: 2017-04-09: \n        00:00: 1.541, 23:00: 0.402\n    Day4: 2017-04-10: \n        00:00: 2.344, 23:00: 0.134\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n    For hour 00:00: (0.134 + 1.407 + 1.541 + 2.344) / 4 = 5.426/4 = 1.3565\n    For hour 01:00: (1.608 + 1.273 + 0.804 + 1.674) /4 = 5.359/4 = 1.33975\n\n    and so on.\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-04-11 to 2017-04-14) would be the same daily pattern repeated.\n\n 10. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n    Day1: average = (sum of 24 values of day1)/24\n    Day2: similarly\n    Day3, Day4.\n\n    However, we don't have a clear trend in the overall level? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving average to smooth the daily pattern and then adjust for the last day's level? \n\n 11. Since the requirement is to provide the next 96 points and we are not given more data, we have to rely on the provided 4 days.\n\n 12. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours over the 4 days and then use that as the daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 13. Steps for computation:\n\n     Let H = [ [day1_h0, day1_h1, ... day1_h23],\n               [day2_h0, ...],\n               [day3_h0, ...],\n               [day4_h0, ...] ]\n\n     Then for each hour i in 0..23:\n         avg_i = (H[0][i] + H[1][i] + H[2][i] + H[3][i]) / 4\n\n     Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n         day5: [avg_0, avg_1, ... avg_23]\n         day6: [avg_0, ...]\n         day7: [avg_0, ...]\n         day8: [avg_0, ...]\n\n 14. However, note that the data might have a downward or upward trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We can also consider using a weighted average (more weight to recent days) but without a clear trend, we stick to simple average.\n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values at that hour from the 4 days.\n\n 16. But note: the last day (2017-04-10) has some negative values? and the pattern might be changing. However, without more data, we use the average.\n\n 17. Implementation:\n\n     We have 96 data points. We can group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and then take the average for each hour.\n\n     Steps:\n        - Extract the hour from the timestamp (the time part: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00)\n        - Group by the hour (ignoring the date) and compute the mean.\n\n 18. However, note: the data is exactly 4 days (96 hours). So we can reshape the HULL column into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n 19. Let's do:\n\n        import numpy as np\n\n        # data is a list of 96 values\n        data = [0.134, 1.608, 1.005, 2.009, 0.134] # ... up to 0.134 at the end\n\n        # reshape to 4 rows and 24 columns\n        data_matrix = np.array(data).reshape(4,24)\n\n        # then compute the mean along the rows (axis=0) for each column (each hour)\n        avg_pattern = data_matrix.mean(axis=0)\n\n        # then the next 96 hours: repeat the avg_pattern 4 times.\n\n 20. But note: the data we are given is from 2017-04-07 to 2017-04-10. The next day is 2017-04-11, then 2017-04-12, 2017-04-13, 2017-04-14.\n\n 21. We must generate the timestamps for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-04-11 00:00:00.\n\n 22. However, the last timestamp in the input is 2017-04-10 23:00:00. So the next one is 2017-04-11 00:00:00.\n\n 23. We'll generate:\n\n        start_date = '2017-04-11 00:00:00'\n        then 96 hours: 4 days.\n\n 24. We'll create a list of timestamps by adding 1 hour each time.\n\n 25. Then the HULL values will be the avg_pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 26. But note: the data might have a non-constant variance? and the average might smooth out some patterns. However, with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 27. Let's compute the average pattern:\n\n     We'll write a small code in our mind (or we can do it step by step) but since we are an AI, we can compute.\n\n     However, we are to output the data in the required format.\n\n 28. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00): (0.134 [day1] + 1.407 [day2] + 1.541 [day3] + 2.344 [day4]) / 4 = (0.134+1.407+1.541+2.344)=5.426 -> 5.426/4 = 1.3565\n     Hour 1 (01:00): (1.608+1.273+0.804+1.674) = 1.608+1.273=2.881; 2.881+0.804=3.685; 3.685+1.674=5.359 -> 5.359/4=1.33975\n     ... and so on.\n\n 29. But we have to do for 24 hours. We'll do it programmatically in our response? Actually, we are to output the data, so we can compute the averages and then list the next 96 points.\n\n 30. However, the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data\", meaning we have to output 96 lines of data.\n\n 31. We are to output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n\n        ```\n        2017-04-11 00:00:00  <value>\n        2017-04-11 01:00:00  <value>\n        ...\n        2017-04-14 23:00:00  <value>\n        ```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 32. We'll compute the average for each hour of the day and then assign that average to the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 33. Steps:\n\n      a. Extract the 96 values from the input (we have them as a list of 96 numbers).\n      b. Reshape into 4 days (rows) x 24 hours (columns).\n      c. Compute the mean for each hour (column mean).\n      d. Repeat this mean pattern 4 times (for the next 4 days).\n\n 34. We'll do the computation manually? Actually, we can write a small script in our mind, but we are to output the data. Since we are an AI, we can compute the averages.\n\n 35. However, to be accurate, we'll compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     We'll list the 4 values for each hour and then the average.\n\n     But note: the data is provided in the order of the timestamps.\n\n     Day1: indices 0-23\n     Day2: 24-47\n     Day3: 48-71\n     Day4: 72-95\n\n     So:\n\n        hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n        hour1: 1, 49, 73, ... \n\n 36. We'll compute:\n\n        hour0: [0.134, 1.407, 1.541, 2.344] -> avg = (0.134+1.407+1.541+2.344)/4 = 5.426/4 = 1.3565\n        hour1: [1.608, 1.273, 0.804, 1.674] -> (1.608+1.273+0.804+1.674)=5.359 -> 1.33975\n        hour2: [1.005, 0.134, 1.340, 1.273] -> (1.005+0.134+1.340+1.273)=3.752 -> 0.938\n        hour3: [2.009, 0.737, 2.143, 0.603] -> (2.009+0.737+2.143+0.603)=5.492 -> 1.373\n        hour4: [1.942, 1.005, 1.206, 2.411] -> (1.942+1.005+1.206+2.411)=6.564 -> 1.641\n        hour5: [1.273, 1.808, 0.469, 2.210] -> (1.273+1.808+0.469+2.210)=5.76 -> 1.44\n        hour6: [0.335, 0.804, 0.000, 1.808] -> (0.335+0.804+0+1.808)=2.947 -> 0.73675\n        hour7: [1.674, 1.340, 3.014, 2.478] -> (1.674+1.340+3.014+2.478)=8.506 -> 2.1265\n        hour8: [1.072, 0.938, 2.009, 0.268] -> (1.072+0.938+2.009+0.268)=4.287 -> 1.07175\n        hour9: [0.804, 0.670, 0.000, 0.201] -> (0.804+0.670+0+0.201)=1.675 -> 0.41875\n        hour10: [0.536, 0.201, 1.273, -0.067] -> (0.536+0.201+1.273-0.067)=1.943 -> 0.48575\n        hour11: [0.469, 0.871, 0.335, -0.067] -> (0.469+0.871+0.335-0.067)=1.608 -> 0.402\n        hour12: [0.067, 0.469, 0.268, -0.402] -> (0.067+0.469+0.268-0.402)=0.402 -> 0.1005\n        hour13: [0.134, 1.942, 0.134, -0.134] -> (0.134+1.942+0.134-0.134)=2.076 -> 0.519\n        hour14: [0.804, 2.813, 0.067, -0.469] -> (0.804+2.813+0.067-0.469)=3.215 -> 0.80375\n        hour15: [0.201, 1.206, 0.134, -0.603] -> (0.201+1.206+0.134-0.603)=0.938 -> 0.2345\n        hour16: [0.067, 0.536, -0.201, -1.206] -> (0.067+0.536-0.201-1.206)= -0.804 -> -0.201\n        hour17: [-0.268, -0.134, -0.335, -1.273] -> (-0.268-0.134-0.335-1.273)= -2.01 -> -0.5025\n        hour18: [-1.072, -1.005, -0.536, -1.273] -> (-1.072-1.005-0.536-1.273)= -3.886 -> -0.9715\n        hour19: [-1.005, -1.407, -0.603, -1.139] -> (-1.005-1.407-0.603-1.139)= -4.154 -> -1.0385\n        hour20: [-1.072, -0.938, -0.871, -1.273] -> (-1.072-0.938-0.871-1.273)= -4.154 -> -1.0385\n        hour21: [-1.005, -0.603, -1.273, -2.344] -> (-1.005-0.603-1.273-2.344)= -5.225 -> -1.30625\n        hour22: [0.067, -1.206, -0.670, -1.273] -> (0.067-1.206-0.670-1.273)= -3.082 -> -0.7705\n        hour23: [1.005, 0.335, 0.402, 0.134] -> (1.005+0.335+0.402+0.134)=1.876 -> 0.469\n\n 37. Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-04-11 to 2017-04-14) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-04-11): [1.3565, 1.33975, 0.938, 1.373, 0.469] ... up to 0.469 for hour23\n        Day2: same pattern\n        Day3: same pattern\n        Day4: same pattern\n\n 38. We must output the values with 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 39. However, note: the input has negative values and fractional values. We'll keep the averages as computed and round to 3 decimals.\n\n 40. Let's round the computed averages:\n\n        hour0: 1.3565 -> 1.357\n        hour1: 1.33975 -> 1.340\n        hour2: 0.938 -> 0.938\n        hour3: 1.373 -> 1.373\n        hour4: 1.641 -> 1.641\n        hour5: 1.44 -> 1.440\n        hour6: 0.73675 -> 0.737\n        hour7: 2.1265 -> 2.127\n        hour8: 1.07175 -> 1.072\n        hour9: 0.41875 -> 0.419\n        hour10: 0.48575 -> 0.486\n        hour11: 0.402 -> 0.402\n        hour12: 0.1005 -> 0.101\n        hour13: 0.519 -> 0.519\n        hour14: 0.80375 -> 0.804\n        hour15: 0.2345 -> 0.234\n        hour16: -0.201 -> -0.201\n        hour17: -0.5025 -> -0.503\n        hour18: -0.9715 -> -0.972\n        hour19: -1.0385 -> -1.038\n        hour20: -1.0385 -> -1.038\n        hour21: -1.30625 -> -1.306\n        hour22: -0.7705 -> -0.770\n        hour23: 0.469 -> 0.469   (exactly 0.469)\n\n 41. Now, we'll write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-11 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.357\n               2017-04-11 01:00:00 -> hour1: 1.340\n               ... until 2017-04-11 23:00:00 -> 0.469\n\n        Then 2017-04-12 00:00:00 -> 1.357\n        ... and so on until 2017-04-14 23:00:00 -> 0.469\n\n 42. We'll be:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2017-04-11 00:00:00 1.357\n        2017-04-11 01:00:00 1.340\n        2017-04-11 02:00:00 0.938\n        2017-04-11 03:00:00 1.373\n        2017-04-11 04:00:00 1.641\n        2017-04-11 05:00:00 1.440\n        2017-04-11 06:00:00 0.737\n        2017-04-11 07:00:00 2.127\n        2017-04-11 08:00:00 1.072\n        2017-04-11 09:00:00 0.419\n        2017-04-11 10:00:00 0.486\n        2017-04-11 11:00:00 0.402\n        2017-04-11 12:00:00 0.101\n        2017-04-11 13:00:00 0.519\n        2017-04-11 14:00:00 0.804\n        2017-04-11 15:00:00 0.234\n        2017-04-11 16:00:00 -0.201\n        2017-04-11 17:00:00 -0.503\n        2017-04-11 18:00:00 -0.972\n        2017-04-11 19:00:00 -1.038\n        2017-04-11 20:00:00 -1.038\n        2017-04-11 21:00:00 -1.306\n        2017-04-11 22:00:00 -0.770\n        2017-04-11 23:00:00 0.469\n\n        Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 43. We'll generate 4 days of this pattern.\n\n 44. We must be cautious: the last day of the input is 2017-04-10, so the next day is 2017-04-11, then 12, 13, 14.\n\n 45. We'll output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 46. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 47. Note: The problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we must output all 96 lines.\n\n 48. We'll write the code block as:\n\n        <answer>\n\n        ```\n        2017-04-11 00:00:00  1.357\n        2017-04-11 01:00:00  1.340\n        ... \n        2017-04-14 23:00:00  0.469\n        ```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 49. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta (but we don't need to code, we can generate by hand)\n\n        We know:\n          2017-04-11 00:00:00\n          2017-04-11 01:00:00\n          ...\n          2017-04-11 23:00:00 -> next day: 2017-04-12 00:00:00\n\n        We have 4 days: 11,12,13,14.\n\n 50. We'll list the 24-hour pattern for 4 times.\n\n 51. We'll write the values in order of the pattern we computed.\n\n 52. We'll use the rounded values.\n\n 53. Let's write the complete data:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-11\n        Day4: 2017-04-14\n\n 54.

We'll write 4 blocks of 24 lines.\n\n 56. We must be careful: the last day of the input is 2017-04-10, so the next day is 2017-04-11.\n\n 57. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-11\n        Day2: 2017-04-12\n        Day3: 2017-04-13\n        Day4: 2017-04-14\n\n 58. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 59. We'll output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 60. Since the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\", we'll output all.\n\n 61. We note that this is a simple average method and might not be the most accurate, but with the data and the requirement, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 62. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 63.
