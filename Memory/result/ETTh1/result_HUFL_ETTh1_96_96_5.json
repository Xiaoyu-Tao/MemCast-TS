        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not show any missing in the given window. However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and we need 96 points ahead, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal methods: The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a seasonal naive method, or more advanced models like SARIMA, or Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters).\n 4. However, without more context and due to the short history, we might use a simple model that captures seasonality.\n\n Since the data is very short, we can see a pattern repeating every 24 hours? Let's check:\n\n    Looking at the data:\n        Day 1 (07-21): starts at 15.204, then 16.945, 15.204, ... and ends at 15.070.\n        Day 2 (07-22): starts at 17.816, then 18.152, ... ends at 14.803.\n        Day 3 (07-23): starts at 14.535, ... ends at 16.209.\n        Day 4 (07-24): starts at 17.080, ... ends at 17.951.\n\n    The pattern is not exactly the same but there is a daily cycle.\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal naive forecast: using the last available season (i.e., the last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, and then repeat for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n    However, note that the last day (07-24) is the most recent and might be the most relevant. But we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days) so we can use the last 24 hours and repeat it 4 times? \n\n    But the data might have a strong daily pattern. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 6. Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n    Option 1: Use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n    Option 2: Use the average of the 4 days for each hour of the day.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n        Day1: min=8.239, max=18.152\n        Day2: min=8.846, max=18.152? (actually 18.152 at 01:00 and 16.476 at 22:00)\n        Day3: min=10.114, max=16.410\n        Day4: min=11.119, max=18.620\n\n    There is no clear trend in 4 days. We are only given 4 days so we cannot see a long-term trend.\n\n 7. We choose to use the average of the 4 days for each hour. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out noise.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        - For hour 00:00: average of [15.204 (day1), 17.816 (day2), 14.535 (day3), 17.080 (day4)] -> (15.204+17.816+14.535+17.080)/4\n        - Similarly for 01:00, 02:00, ... 23:00.\n\n    Then we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n 8. But note: the data we are given ends at 2016-07-24 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-25 23:00:00 -> first day\n        2016-07-26 00:00:00 to 2016-07-26 23:00:00 -> second day\n        2016-07-27 00:00:00 to 2016-07-27 23:00:00 -> third day\n        2016-07-28 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00 -> fourth day\n\n 9. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Let's extract the data by hour of day:\n\n        Hour 0: [15.204, 17.816, 14.535, 17.080] -> average = (15.204+17.816+14.535+17.080)/4 = 16.15875\n        Hour 1: [16.945, 18.152, 13.664, 18.219] -> (16.945+18.152+13.664+18.219)/4 = 16.745\n        ... and so on.\n\n 10. However, note that the provided data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 11. But wait: the data might have missing values? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points we don't see any. \n     we are to forecast the next 96. We are using an average method that is robust to some missingness? But we don't have missing in the history.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. However, the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide a forecast.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, we choose the average by hour method.\n\n 14. Steps:\n\n      a. Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n      b. For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values we have 4 days.\n      c. This gives us a 24-hour profile.\n      d. Repeat this profile 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n 15. We must generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-07-25 00:00:00.\n\n 16. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: (15.204 + 17.816999 + 14.535 + 17.080) / 4 \n        = (15.204 + 17.817 + 14.535 + 17.080) = 64.636 -> 16.159\n\n      We'll do for all 24 hours.\n\n 17. We'll create a list of 24 average values (for hours 0 to 23).\n\n 18. Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating this list 4 times.\n\n 19. The dates: \n        Start: 2016-07-25 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 20. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, HUFL\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00, [value1]\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00, [value2]\n        ...\n        2016-07-28 23:00:00, [value96]\n        </answer>\n\n 21. We must be cautious: the data provided has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 22. Let's compute the averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (15.204 + 17.817 + 14.535 + 17.080) / 4 = (64.636) / 4 = 16.159\n      Hour 1: (16.946 + 18.152 + 13.664 + 18.219) / 4 = (66.981) / 4 = 16.745\n      Hour 2: (15.204 + 16.276 + 12.860 + 18.620) / 4 = (62.96) / 4 = 15.740\n      Hour 3: (13.932 + 15.271 + 13.329 + 17.750) / 4 = (60.282) / 4 = 15.071\n      Hour 4: (13.731 + 12.525 + 12.659 + 15.070) / 4 = (53.985) / 4 = 13.496\n      Hour 5: (13.530 + 13.329 + 11.721 + 16.142) / 4 = (54.722) / 4 = 13.681\n      Hour 6: (14.200 + 12.860 + 11.320 + 15.137) / 4 = (53.517) / 4 = 13.379\n      Hour 7: (13.798 + 12.324 + 11.922 + 15.539) / 4 = (53.583) / 4 = 13.396\n      Hour 8: (13.932 + 10.516 + 10.114 + 11.119) / 4 = (45.681) / 4 = 11.420\n      Hour 9: (12.927 + 11.922 + 11.119 + 11.721) / 4 = (47.689) / 4 = 11.922\n      Hour10: (10.918 + 11.588 + 11.186 + 12.257) / 4 = (45.949) / 4 = 11.487\n      Hour11: (11.521 + 11.588 + 11.788 + 12.927) / 4 = (47.824) / 4 = 11.956\n      Hour12: (9.377 + 10.516 + 11.855 + 12.793) / 4 = (44.541) / 4 = 11.135\n      Hour13: (10.047 + 11.588 + 12.726 + 14.200) / 4 = (48.561) / 4 = 12.140\n      Hour14: (9.913 + 11.387 + 12.458 + 13.195) / 4 = (46.953) / 4 = 11.738\n      Hour15: (8.239 + 11.119 + 12.123 + 12.525) / 4 = (44.006) / 4 = 11.002\n      Hour16: (8.239 + 10.114 + 11.119 + 12.257) / 4 = (41.729) / 4 = 10.432\n      Hour17: (9.377 + 10.516 + 11.320 + 12.190) / 4 = (43.403) / 4 = 10.851\n      Hour18: (9.444 + 9.846 + 11.253 + 11.788) / 4 = (42.331) / 4 = 10.583\n      Hour19: (8.908 + 9.846 + 11.253 + 13.195) / 4 = (43.202) / 4 = 10.801\n      Hour20: (12.592 + 14.267 + 13.597 + 16.946) / 4 = (57.402) / 4 = 14.351\n      Hour21: (14.535 + 14.669 + 16.075 + 17.214) / 4 = (62.493) / 4 = 15.623\n      Hour22: (14.200 + 16.477 + 16.410 + 18.219) / 4 = (65.306) / 4 = 16.327\n      Hour23: (15.070 + 14.803 + 16.209 + 17.951) / 4 = (64.033) / 4 = 16.008\n\n 23. Now, we have 24 values (from hour0 to hour23). We will repeat these 4 times.\n\n 24. The forecast for 2016-07-25 00:00:00 is 16.159, 2016-07-25 01:00:00 is 16.745, ... until 2016-07-25 23:00:00 (16.008). Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 25. We write the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-07-25 00:00:00\n      Then 2016-07-25 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n\n 26. We output in the required format.\n\n 27. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output 96 lines.\n\n 28. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00,16.159\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00,16.745\n        2016-07-25 02:00:00,15.740\n        2016-07-25 03:00:00,15.071\n        ...\n\n 29. We'll generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 30. We note that the average method is simple and might not capture the dynamics, but with the given data and without a more sophisticated model, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 31. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00,16.159\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00,16.745\n        2016-07-25 02:00:00,15.740\n        2016-07-25 03:00:00,15.071\n        2016-07-25 04:00:00,13.496\n        2016-07-25 05:00:00,13.681\n        2016-07-25 06:00:00,13.379\n        2016-07-25 07:00:00,13.396\n        2016-07-25 08:00:00,11.420\n        2016-07-25 09:00:00,11.922\n        2016-07-25 10:00:00,11.487\n        2016-07-25 11:00:00,11.956\n        2016-07-25 12:00:00,11.135\n        2016-07-25 13:00:00,12.140\n        2016-07-25 14:00:00,11.738\n        2016-07-25 15:00:00,11.002\n        2016-07-25 16:00:00,10.432\n        2016-07-25 17:00:00,10.851\n        2016-07-25 18:00:00,10.583\n        2016-07-25 19:00:00,10.801\n        2016-07-25 20:00:00,14.351\n        2016-07-25 21:00:00,15.623\n        2016-07-25 22:00:00,16.327\n        2016-07-25 23:00:00,16.008\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 32. We note that the next day (2016-07-26) will have the same 24 values in the same order.\n\n 33. We generate the entire 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 34. We write the output in the required markdown code block.\n\n 35. Let's code the generation:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016, 7, 25)\n        hours = [0,1,2,...,23] for 4 days.\n\n        values = [16.159, 16.745, 15.740, 16.008]  # 24 values as above\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # format date as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n                value = values[hour]\n\n 36. But note: the base_date for day0 is 2016-07-25, then day1: 2016-07-26, day2: 2016-07-27, day3: 2016-07-28.\n\n 37. We output the string.\n\n 38. We must be cautious: the original data had 3 decimal places. We computed the averages and rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 39. We write the answer.\n",
