        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a seasonal time series model.\n 2. Given the data size is small (only 4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that handles seasonality, such as SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS). However, with only 96 points, a complex model might overfit.\n 3. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast might need to account for the possibility of missing data in the training? But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n However, note: the last provided point is at 2017-04-14 23:00:00. The next 96 points would be from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n\n 4. We choose a model: Given the seasonality and the small data size, we can use a seasonal naive method, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, we can use ETS or a simple seasonal decomposition.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a robust method.\n\n 5. We can use the following approach:\n    - Use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) with parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). However, with only 4 days, we might be limited.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a model that works well with multiple seasonality, but we only have one seasonality (daily).\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a simple model. Let's do:\n    - We observe that the data has a daily pattern: low during the night, then a peak in the morning and then again in the evening? Let's check:\n\n      The data for each day:\n        2017-04-11: \n          00:00: 1.492, then decreases to 1.371 at 02:00 and 03:00, then increases to 1.614, 1.828, then 2.833 at 06:00, then 2.619, 2.863, 3.015, 2.924, 3.259 at 11:00, then 2.437 at 12:00, then 2.041, 2.650, 2.315, 2.589, 3.290 at 17:00, then 2.711, 2.863, 2.741, 2.619, 2.315, 2.224.\n\n        So: two peaks: one in the morning (around 6-11) and one in the evening (around 17:00).\n\n      Similarly, the next days show similar patterns.\n\n 8. We can use a model that captures two peaks per day? But note that the seasonality is 24 hours.\n\n 9. We will use a SARIMA model. We need to choose parameters. We can use auto_arima to select the best parameters, but we are not running code. So we have to use a standard approach.\n\n 10. Since we are not actually running code, we have to simulate the process. But note: the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 points.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? That is, for each hour in the forecast, we take the average of that same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n     Example for 00:00: \n        Day1: 1.492, Day2: 2.102, Day3: 1.888, Day4: 1.706 -> average = (1.492+2.102+1.888+1.706)/4 = 1.797\n\n     Then for 01:00: \n        Day1: 1.462, Day2: 1.828, Day3: 1.736, Day4: 1.645 -> average = (1.462+1.828+1.736+1.645)/4 = 1.66775\n\n     But note: the last day (2017-04-14) has a value at 23:00: 2.406, but the previous days at 23:00: \n        2017-04-11: 2.224, 2017-04-12: 1.919, 2017-04-13: 2.163 -> so for 23:00: (2.224+1.919+2.163+2.406)/4 = 2.178\n\n 12. However, this method does not account for any trend. But we don't have a clear trend in 4 days.\n\n 13. We can also consider using the last day (2017-04-14) as the pattern and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might be complex.\n\n 14. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have to provide 96 points, we can use the average by hour method. This is a simple seasonal naive forecast with averaging.\n\n 15. Steps for the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours) we do:\n\n     For hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we set:\n        forecast_h = (h0 + h1 + h2 + h3) / 4\n        where h0 is the value at hour h on 2017-04-11, h1 on 2017-04-12, h2 on 2017-04-13, h3 on 2017-04-14.\n\n 16. But note: the data we have for 2017-04-14 ends at 23:00:00, so we have all 24 hours for each of the 4 days.\n\n 17. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (1.492 + 2.102 + 1.888 + 1.706) / 4 = (1.492+2.102=3.594; 3.594+1.888=5.482; 5.482+1.706=7.188) -> 7.188/4 = 1.797\n     Hour 1: (1.462+1.828+1.736+1.645) = 1.462+1.828=3.29; 3.29+1.736=5.026; 5.026+1.645=6.671 -> 6.671/4 = 1.66775\n     Hour 2: (1.371+1.888+1.919+1.797) = 1.371+1.888=3.259; 3.259+1.919=5.178; 5.178+1.797=6.975 -> 6.975/4=1.74375\n     Hour 3: (1.371+1.797+2.041+1.949) = 1.371+1.797=3.168; 3.168+2.041=5.209; 5.209+1.949=7.158 -> 7.158/4=1.7895\n     Hour 4: (1.614+1.858+1.797+1.919) = 1.614+1.858=3.472; 3.472+1.797=5.269; 5.269+1.919=7.188 -> 7.188/4=1.797\n     Hour 5: (1.828+2.284+2.498+2.163) = 1.828+2.284=4.112; 4.112+2.498=6.61; 6.61+2.163=8.773 -> 8.773/4=2.19325\n     Hour 6: (2.833+2.924+3.015+2.894) = 2.833+2.924=5.757; 5.757+3.015=8.772; 8.772+2.894=11.666 -> 11.666/4=2.9165\n     Hour 7: (2.619+3.137+3.472+2.741) = 2.619+3.137=5.756; 5.756+3.472=9.228; 9.228+2.741=11.969 -> 11.969/4=2.99225\n     Hour 8: (2.863+2.254+3.290+2.924) = 2.863+2.254=5.117; 5.117+3.290=8.407; 8.407+2.924=11.331 -> 11.331/4=2.83275\n     Hour 9: (3.015+2.193+3.076+2.680) = 3.015+2.193=5.208; 5.208+3.076=8.284; 8.284+2.680=10.964 -> 10.964/4=2.741\n     Hour 10: (2.924+2.315+3.350+2.772) = 2.924+2.315=5.239; 5.239+3.350=8.589; 8.589+2.772=11.361 -> 11.361/4=2.84025\n     Hour 11: (3.259+3.107+3.229+3.046) = 3.259+3.107=6.366; 6.366+3.229=9.595; 9.595+3.046=12.641 -> 12.641/4=3.16025\n     Hour 12: (2.437+2.376+2.437+2.193) = 2.437+2.376=4.813; 4.813+2.437=7.25; 7.25+2.193=9.443 -> 9.443/4=2.36075\n     Hour 13: (2.041+2.284+2.559+2.254) = 2.041+2.284=4.325; 4.325+2.559=6.884; 6.884+2.254=9.138 -> 9.138/4=2.2845\n     Hour 14: (2.650+2.071+2.284+2.345) = 2.650+2.071=4.721; 4.721+2.284=7.005; 7.005+2.345=9.35 -> 9.35/4=2.3375\n     Hour 15: (2.315+2.254+2.284+2.376) = 2.315+2.254=4.569; 4.569+2.284=6.853; 6.853+2.376=9.229 -> 9.229/4=2.30725\n     Hour 16: (2.589+2.163+2.528+2.680) = 2.589+2.163=4.752; 4.752+2.528=7.28; 7.28+2.680=9.96 -> 9.96/4=2.49\n     Hour 17: (3.290+2.955+2.924+2.894) = 3.290+2.955=6.245; 6.245+2.924=9.169; 9.169+2.894=12.063 -> 12.063/4=3.01575\n     Hour 18: (2.711+2.802+2.650+2.772) = 2.711+2.802=5.513; 5.513+2.650=8.163; 8.163+2.772=10.935 -> 10.935/4=2.73375\n     Hour 19: (2.863+2.894+2.863+2.559) = 2.863+2.894=5.757; 5.757+2.863=8.62; 8.62+2.559=11.179 -> 11.179/4=2.79475\n     Hour 20: (2.741+2.955+2.650+2.741) = 2.741+2.955=5.696; 5.696+2.650=8.346; 8.346+2.741=11.087 -> 11.087/4=2.77175\n     Hour 21: (2.619+2.559+2.254+2.528) = 2.619+2.559=5.178; 5.178+2.254=7.432; 7.432+2.528=9.96 -> 9.96/4=2.49\n     Hour 22: (2.315+2.041+2.163+2.041) = 2.315+2.041=4.356; 4.356+2.163=6.519; 6.519+2.041=8.56 -> 8.56/4=2.14\n     Hour 23: (2.224+1.919+2.163+2.406) = 2.224+1.919=4.143; 4.143+2.163=6.306; 6.306+2.406=8.712 -> 8.712/4=2.178\n\n 18. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-04-15 to 2017-04-18) will be:\n\n      Day1 (2017-04-15):\n        00:00:00 -> 1.797\n        01:00:00 -> 1.66775\n        02:00:00 -> 1.74375\n        03:00:00 -> 1.7895\n        04:00:00 -> 1.797\n        05:00:00 -> 2.19325\n        06:00:00 -> 2.9165\n        07:00:00 -> 2.99225\n        08:00:00 -> 2.83275\n        09:00:00 -> 2.741\n        10:00:00 -> 2.84025\n        11:00:00 -> 3.16025\n        12:00:00 -> 2.36075\n        13:00:00 -> 2.2845\n        14:00:00 -> 2.3375\n        15:00:00 -> 2.30725\n        16:00:00 -> 2.49\n        17:00:00 -> 3.01575\n        18:00:00 -> 2.73375\n        19:00:00 -> 2.79475\n        20:00:00 -> 2.77175\n        21:00:00 -> 2.49\n        22:00:00 -> 2.14\n        23:00:00 -> 2.178\n\n      Then the next three days (2017-04-16, 2017-04-17, 2017-04-18) will be the same as above? \n      But note: we are using the same average for each day. So the entire 96 hours will be the 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n 19. However, we must output 96 points. So we will repeat the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 20. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. We are not given any missing values in the training, so we assume the forecast is for 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 21. We output the data in the same format: date and LUFL.\n\n 22. We must generate the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 23. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n        Hour0: 1.797 -> 1.797\n        Hour1: 1.66775 -> 1.668\n        Hour2: 1.74375 -> 1.744\n        Hour3: 1.7895 -> 1.790\n        Hour4: 1.797 -> 1.797\n        Hour5: 2.19325 -> 2.193\n        Hour6: 2.9165 -> 2.917\n        But note: 2.9165 rounded to 3 decimals: 2.917? \n            Since the digit after thousandth is 5, we round up: 2.9165 -> 2.917\n        Similarly, \n        Hour7: 2.99225 -> 2.992\n        Hour8: 2.83275 -> 2.833\n        Hour9: 2.741 -> 2.741\n        Hour10: 2.84025 -> 2.840\n        Hour11: 3.16025 -> 3.160\n        Hour12: 2.36075 -> 2.361\n        Hour13: 2.2845 -> 2.285 (since 2.2845 -> 2.285? \n            Actually, 2.2845: the digit in the thousandth place is 4 and the next is 5 -> round up the 4 to 5? \n            But wait: 2.2845: \n                thousandth place is 4, and the next is 5 -> we round up: 2.285)\n        However, let me check: \n            The rule: if the next digit is 5, then we round to the nearest even? But in many systems, we round 5 up. \n            We'll use standard rounding: 0-4 down, 5-9 up.\n\n        So:\n          Hour13: 2.2845 -> 2.285\n        Hour14: 2.3375 -> 2.338\n        Hour15: 2.30725 -> 2.307\n        because 2.30725: the thousandth is 7, then 2 -> so we look at the next: 2 -> so 2.307? \n        Actually: \n          2.30725: \n            thousandth place: 7, and the next digit is 2 (which is <5) -> so we leave 7 as is -> 2.307\n        But wait, we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n          We look at the fourth decimal: 2 -> so we leave the third decimal as 7 -> 2.307.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n        Hour16: 2.49 -> 2.490 (but note: 2.49 is 2.49000, so we write 2.490)\n        Actually, the average was 2.49 exactly? But we computed 9.96/4=2.49 -> so 2.490.\n\n        We'll write all to 3 decimals.\n\n        Let's recast:\n\n        Hour0: 1.797\n        Hour1: 1.668\n        Hour2: 1.744\n        Hour3: 1.790\n        Hour4: 1.797\n        Hour5: 2.193\n        Hour6: 2.917\n        Hour7: 2.992\n        Hour8: 2.833\n        Hour9: 2.741\n        Hour10: 2.840\n        Hour11: 3.160\n        Hour12: 2.361\n        Hour13: 2.285\n        Hour14: 2.338\n        Hour15: 2.307\n        Hour16: 2.490\n        Hour17: 3.016   (because 3.01575 -> 3.016)\n        Hour18: 2.734   (2.73375 -> 2.734)\n        Hour19: 2.795   (2.79475 -> 2.795)\n        Hour20: 2.772   (2.77175 -> 2.772)\n        Hour21: 2.490\n        Hour22: 2.140   (because 2.14 is 2.140? but we computed 8.56/4=2.14 -> so 2.140? But the input had 2.041, etc. so we output 2.140)\n        However, we computed 2.14 exactly? Actually, 8.56/4=2.14 -> so we write 2.140.\n\n        Hour23: 2.178   (exactly 2.178? 8.712/4=2.178 -> 2.178)\n\n 24. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-04-15 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-04-14 23:00:00)\n      Then 2017-04-15 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We have 4 days, so we output the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 26.
