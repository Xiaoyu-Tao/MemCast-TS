        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). The pattern: \n    - Positive values during the night and early morning (00:00 to 07:00) but with a dip at 07:00? \n    - Then a drop to negative values during the day (from 08:00 to 17:00) with the most negative around midday.\n    - Then a rise in the evening (18:00 onwards) to positive again.\n\n 2. However, there are some anomalies (like on 2017-05-20 11:00:00 which is 0.320, while the surrounding are negative) and missing values? \n    The user says there are missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any explicit missing (like NaN). \n    But note: the data might have been preprocessed? We are told to be aware of missing values, but in the given data we have 96 consecutive points.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data has hourly frequency, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models. We'll use a simple seasonal method.\n\n 5. Approach: \n    We can use a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour by the value of the same hour in the previous day (or average of the same hour over the available days). \n    However, we have 4 days of data. We can compute the average pattern for the 4 days and then adjust for the last known value?\n\n 6. But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We only have 4 consecutive days (Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). We don't have a full week. \n    However, we are only forecasting the next 4 days (Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed?).\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-20) as a template for the next day? But that was a Saturday. \n    The next 4 days: \n        2017-05-21: Sunday\n        2017-05-22: Monday\n        2017-05-23: Tuesday\n        2017-05-24: Wednesday\n\n    We don't have a Sunday in the training, so we might use the average of the available days for each hour? \n\n 8. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days:\n\n    We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n    We can group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a trend? But 4 days is too short for a trend. Also, the problem says there might be missing values, but we don't see any.\n\n 9. But wait: the data on 2017-05-19 (Friday) has a different pattern during the day (for example, at 10:00:00 it was -0.320, while the previous days were around -10 to -12). \n    This might be an anomaly? Or maybe because it's Friday? \n\n    We are forecasting Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We have:\n\n        Training: \n            Wednesday (2017-05-17)\n            Thursday (2017-05-18)\n            Friday (2017-05-19) ->         Saturday (2017-05-20)\n\n    We don't have Sunday in the training. So we can use the average of the four days for Sunday? But the pattern on Saturday and Sunday might be similar? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last week same day? But we don't have a week of data.\n\n10. Given the data, the safest is to use the average of the 4 days for each hour. \n\n    Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        Let h be the hour (e.g., 0 for 00:00, 1 for 01:00, ... 23 for 23:00.\n        We take the average of the values at hour h for the 4 days.\n\n    Then we forecast the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating this average pattern 4 times? \n\n    But note: the average pattern might smooth out the daily pattern. However, we don't have a strong reason to believe that the next days will be exactly the same as the average of the last 4 days.\n\n11. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the template for Sunday? But then Monday might be similar to the previous Monday? We don't have Monday data.\n\n    Since we have only 4 days, and they are consecutive, and we are forecasting the next 4 days, we can use the average pattern.\n\n12. However, let's check the data: \n    The four days are not exactly the same. For example, the negative values during the day on Friday (2017-05-19) are less negative than the other days? \n\n    We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [2.239, 4.620, 3.305, 3.127] -> (2.239+4.620+3.305+3.127)/4 = 13.291/4 = 3.32275\n        hour1: [2.559, 3.305, 3.340, 2.949] -> (2.559+3.305+3.340+2.949)/4 = 12.153/4 = 3.03825\n        ... and so on.\n\n    Then we create 4 days of forecast by repeating this 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n13. But note: the data might have a drift? We can adjust by the last value? \n\n    The last value is 2.665 (at 2017-05-20 23:00:00. The average for hour23 is: \n        [3.767, 3.376, 3.340, 2.665] -> (3.767+3.376+3.340+2.665)/4 = 13.148/4 = 3.287\n\n    So the last value is below the average. We might adjust the entire pattern by the ratio of the last value to the average of the last hour? \n\n    However, that might be too simplistic.\n\n14. Another idea: use the average daily pattern but adjust by the level of the last day? \n\n    We can compute the average of the last day (2017-05-20) and the average of the entire 4 days? Then adjust the pattern by the ratio? \n\n    But note: the daily average of the last day might be different.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving average method.\n\n15. Given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a lot of data, we'll use the average pattern without adjustment.\n\n16. Steps:\n\n    a) Group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    b) Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n17. But note: the data has a clear pattern that repeats every 24 hours, so this should be acceptable.\n\n18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n    We'll compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Then the forecast for:\n        2017-05-21 00:00:00: mean of hour0\n        2017-05-21 01:00:00: mean of hour1\n        ...\n        2017-05-21 23:00:00: mean of hour23\n        2017-05-22 00:00:00: mean of hour0\n        ... and so on.\n\n19. We must generate 96 points.\n\n20. Now, we note that the provided data ends at 2017-05-20 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n        2017-05-21 00:00:00\n        2017-05-21 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-05-24 23:00:00\n\n21. We'll calculate the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00): [2.239, 4.620, 3.305, 3.127] -> (2.239+4.620+3.305+3.127)/4 = 13.291/4 = 3.32275\n    Hour 1 (01:00): [2.559, 3.305, 3.340, 2.949] -> (2.559+3.305+3.340+2.949)/4 = 12.153/4 = 3.03825\n    Hour 2 (02:00): [3.340, 3.127, 3.163, 3.411] -> (3.340+3.127+3.163+3.411)/4 = 13.041/4 = 3.26025\n    Hour 3 (03:00): [4.939, 3.802, 3.269, 4.158] -> (4.939+3.802+3.269+4.158)/4 = 16.168/4 = 4.042\n    Hour 4 (04:00): [4.691, 3.376, 4.513, 3.873] -> (4.691+3.376+4.513+3.873)/4 = 16.453/4 = 4.11325\n    Hour 5 (05:00): [6.005, 4.371, 4.726, 4.975] -> (6.005+4.371+4.726+4.975)/4 = 20.077/4 = 5.01925\n    Hour 6 (06:00): [6.005, 2.097, 4.939, 4.584] -> (6.005+2.097+4.939+4.584)/4 = 17.625/4 = 4.40625\n    Hour 7 (07:00): [1.457, 0.995, 3.767, -0.355] -> (1.457+0.995+3.767-0.355)/4 = 5.864/4 = 1.466\n    Hour 8 (08:00): [-5.330, -5.010, -3.127, -5.010] -> (-5.330-5.010-3.127-5.010)/4 = -18.477/4 = -4.61925\n    Hour 9 (09:00): [-11.478, -10.056, -4.015, -9.417] -> (-11.478-10.056-4.015-9.417)/4 = -34.966/4 = -8.7415\n    Hour 10 (10:00): [-12.224, -12.793, -0.320, -12.082] -> (-12.224-12.793-0.320-12.082)/4 = -37.419/4 = -9.35475\n    Hour 11 (11:00): [-14.854, -15.991, -0.746, 0.320] -> (-14.854-15.991-0.746+0.320)/4 = -31.271/4 = -7.81775\n    Hour 12 (12:00): [-17.306, -17.021, -3.660, -3.553] -> (-17.306-17.021-3.660-3.553)/4 = -41.54/4 = -10.385\n    Hour 13 (13:00): [-16.737, -15.671, -6.681, -12.544] -> (-16.737-15.671-6.681-12.544)/4 = -51.633/4 = -12.90825\n    Hour 14 (14:00): [-14.605, -8.457, -1.066, -13.219] -> (-14.605-8.457-1.066-13.219)/4 = -37.347/4 = -9.33675\n    Hour 15 (15:00): [-11.407, -11.229, -5.615, -9.523] -> (-11.407-11.229-5.615-9.523)/4 = -37.774/4 = -9.4435\n    Hour 16 (16:00): [-6.787, -7.711, -1.919, -0.995] -> (-6.787-7.711-1.919-0.995)/4 = -17.412/4 = -4.353\n    Hour 17 (17:00): [-0.782, -1.421, 2.807, 1.208] -> (-0.782-1.421+2.807+1.208)/4 = 1.812/4 = 0.453\n    Hour 18 (18:00): [3.163, 2.807, 1.919, 2.487] -> (3.163+2.807+1.919+2.487)/4 = 10.376/4 = 2.594\n    Hour 19 (19:00): [3.873, 4.264, 3.802, 3.660] -> (3.873+4.264+3.802+3.660)/4 = 15.599/4 = 3.89975\n    Hour 20 (20:00): [4.158, 4.406, 4.158, 4.051] -> (4.158+4.406+4.158+4.051)/4 = 16.773/4 = 4.19325\n    Hour 21 (21:00): [3.838, 3.838, 3.696, 3.660] -> (3.838+3.838+3.696+3.660)/4 = 15.032/4 = 3.758\n    Hour 22 (22:00): [4.442, 3.340, 3.696, 3.092] -> (4.442+3.340+3.696+3.092)/4 = 14.57/4 = 3.6425\n    Hour 23 (23:00): [3.767, 3.376, 3.340, 2.665] -> (3.767+3.376+3.340+2.665)/4 = 13.148/4 = 3.287\n\n22. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n    Day1: 2017-05-21 (Sunday): \n        00:00: 3.32275\n        01:00: 3.03825\n        02:00: 3.26025\n        03:00: 4.042\n        04:00: 4.11325\n        05:00: 5.01925\n        06:00: 4.40625\n        07:00: 1.466\n        08:00: -4.61925\n        09:00: -8.7415\n        10:00: -9.35475\n        11:00: -7.81775\n        12:00: -10.385\n        13:00: -12.90825\n        14:00: -9.33675\n        15:00: -9.4435\n        16:00: -4.353\n        17:00: 0.453\n        18:00: 2.594\n        19:00: 3.89975\n        20:00: 4.19325\n        21:00: 3.758\n        22:00: 3.6425\n        23:00: 3.287\n\n    Day2: 2017-05-22 (Monday): same pattern\n        00:00: 3.32275\n        01:00: 3.03825\n        ... and so on.\n\n    Similarly for Day3 (Tuesday) and Day4 (Wednesday).\n\n23. We'll generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-05-21 00:00:00 (which is the next after 2017-05-20 23:00:00)\n    Then 2017-05-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n24. Format: we must output in the same format as the input, with the date and the MUFL value.\n\n25. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. But note: the averages might have more, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n26. However, note: the user says the data has missing values, but we are not given any in the input. We are generating without missing values.\n\n27. We output 96 lines.\n\n28. Let's code the output:\n\n    We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours, starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00.\n\n    Then assign the average value for the corresponding hour (0 to 23) for 4 days.\n\n29. We must be cautious: the first forecast point is for 2017-05-21 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 3.323 (rounded)\n\n30. We'll write the numbers rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n31. Example for the first few:\n\n        date                 MUFL\n        2017-05-21 00:00:00 3.323\n        2017-05-21 01:00:00 3.038\n        ...\n\n32. But note: the input had negative numbers and we are averaging, so we must round appropriately.\n\n33. We'll do:\n\n        value = round(mean_value, 3)\n\n34. However, the input had 3 decimal places, but sometimes more digits? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places.\n\n35. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017,5,21,0,0,0)\n        then add 96 hours.\n\n    But we are in a text environment, so we can do:\n\n        base = datetime.strptime(\"2017-05-21 00:00:00\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        then for i in range(96):\n            date = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n36. But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n    We'll write 96 lines.\n\n37. We have the pattern for 24 hours (index 0 to 23) and we repeat 4 times.\n\n    Pattern array (with rounded values):\n\n        hour0: 3.323\n        hour1: 3.038\n        hour2: 3.260\n        hour3: 4.042\n        hour4: 4.113\n        hour5: 5.019\n        hour6: 4.406\n        hour7: 1.466\n        hour8: -4.619\n        hour9: -8.742   (because -8.7415 rounded to 3 decimals: -8.742)\n        hour10: -9.355\n        hour11: -7.818\n        hour12: -10.385\n        hour13: -12.908\n        hour14: -9.337\n        hour15: -9.444\n        hour16: -4.353\n        hour17: 0.453\n        hour18: 2.594\n        hour19: 3.900\n        hour20: 4.193\n        hour21: 3.758\n        hour22: 3.643\n        hour23: 3.287\n\n    Then for the 4 days, we repeat this 24 numbers 4 times.\n\n38. Now, we write the output in the required format.\n\n    We must output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-21 00:00:00   3.323\n2017-05-21 01:00:00   3.038\n2017-05-21 02:00:00   3.260\n... \n2017-05-24 23:00:00   3.287\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n39. Let's generate the dates:\n\n    Day1: 2017-05-21: hours 0 to 23 -> 24 lines\n    Day2: 2017-05-22: hours 0 to 23 -> 24 lines\n    Day3: 2017-05-23: hours 0 to 23 -> 24 lines\n    Day4: 2017-05-24: hours 0 to 23 -> 24 lines\n\n40. We'll write the 96 lines accordingly.\n\n41. We must be careful: the rounding.\n\n    For example, hour9: -8.7415 -> round to 3 decimals: \n        The fourth decimal is 5, so we round up: -8.742\n\n    Similarly, hour10: -9.35475 -> -9.355\n\n    hour11: -7.81775 -> -7.818\n\n    hour12: -10.385 -> remains -10.385\n\n    hour13: -12.90825 -> -12.908\n\n    hour14: -9.33675 -> -9.337\n\n    hour15: -9.4435 -> -9.444\n\n    hour19: 3.89975 -> 3.900\n\n    hour22: 3.6425 -> 3.643? Actually, 3.6425 rounded to 3 decimals: \n        The fourth decimal is 5, so we round to 3.643.\n\n    But note: 3.6425 is exactly halfway? Some rounding rules: round half to even? \n    However, the problem doesn't specify. We'll use standard rounding: round half up.\n\n    In Python: \n        round(3.6425, 3) -> 3.643? \n        But note: 3.6425 * 1000 = 3642.5 -> then round to integer: 3643? \n\n    We'll do:\n\n        -8.7415 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> then round up the third decimal: 1 becomes 2 -> -8.742\n\n    So we'll round each number to 3 decimals using round_half_up.\n\n    But since we are writing manually, we can do:\n\n        We have the computed averages above, and we'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n    We'll list the 24 values again after rounding:\n\n        hour0: 3.32275 -> 3.323\n        hour1: 3.03825 -> 3.038\n        hour2: 3.26025 -> 3.260\n        hour3: 4.042 -> 4.042\n        hour4: 4.11325 -> 4.113\n        hour5: 5.01925 -> 5.019\n        hour6: 4.40625 -> 4.406\n        hour7: 1.466 -> 1.466\n        hour8: -4.61925 -> -4.619\n        hour9: -8.7415 -> -8.742\n        hour10: -9.35475 -> -9.355\n        hour11: -7.81775 -> -7.818\n        hour12: -10.385 -> -10.385\n        hour13: -12.90825 -> -12.908\n        hour14: -9.33675 -> -9.337\n        hour15: -9.4435 -> -9.444\n        hour16: -4.353 -> -4.353\n        hour17: 0.453 -> 0.453\n        hour18: 2.594 -> 2.594\n        hour19: 3.89975 -> 3.900\n        hour20: 4.19325 -> 4.193\n        hour21: 3.758 -> 3.758\n        hour22: 3.6425 -> 3.643\n        hour23: 3.287 -> 3.287\n\n42. Now, we write the output.\n\n    Day1: 2017-05-21\n        00:00:00 -> 3.323\n        01:00:00 -> 3.038\n        02:00:00 -> 3.260\n        03:00:00 -> 4.042\n        04:00:00 -> 4.113\n        05:00:00 -> 5.019\n        06:00:00 -> 4.406\n        07:00:00 -> 1.466\n        08:00:00 -> -4.619\n        09:00:00 -> -8.742\n        10:00:00 -> -9.355\n        11:00:00 -> -7.818\n        12:00:00 -> -10.385\n        13:00:00 -> -12.908\n        14:00:00 -> -9.337\n        15:00:00 -> -9.444\n        16:00:00 -> -4.353\n        17:00:00 -> 0.453\n        18:00:00 -> 2.594\n        19:00:00 -> 3.900\n        20:00:00 -> 4.193\n        21:00:00 -> 3.758\n        22:00:00 -> 3.643\n        23:00:00 -> 3.287\n\n    Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n43. We'll write the dates accordingly.\n\n    The next day (2017-05-22) starts at 00:00:00 -> again 3.323, and so on.\n\n44. We output 96 lines.\n\n45. We must format the numbers to have 3 decimal places, and the date in the same format.\n\n46.

We must generate 96 lines.\n\n48. We'll do the same pattern for 4 days.\n\n49. We note that the last line is 2017-05-24 23:00:00 -> 3.287\n\n50. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n51. This is a simple method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, exponential smoothing with seasonality, or machine learning) but given the constraints, we use this.\n\n52. We are aware that the data might have missing values, but we are not given any in the input, and we are generating without missing values.\n\n53.
