        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-04-07 00:00:00 to 2017-04-10 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for the purpose of forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a clear daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that uses daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model or a model like SARIMA. However, note that we have only 96 points and we are to forecast 96 points. \n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal approach: using the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days of history.\n\n 6. Considering the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we can use a forecasting method that can handle seasonality.\n\n 7. We'll use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n    - Extrapolate the trend linearly (or using a moving average) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 8. However, with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the last two days and then apply the seasonal component from the entire period? \n\n 10. Given the constraints, we can use a seasonal naive forecast: \n     y_{t+24} = y_{t}   [if we assume that the next day will be the same as the last day?] \n     But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n\n 11. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n     However, note that there might be a trend. We can adjust by the overall level.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day 4) as the base and then adjust by the average change from day to day? \n\n 13. Given the time and simplicity, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the next 4 days. \n\n Steps for the method:\n   - Group the data by hour (so we have 24 groups: hour0, hour1, ... hour23)\n   - For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n   - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will use the computed mean for each hour.\n\n Why this method is simple and captures the seasonality.\n\n However, note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level of the series:\n\n   Day1: from -0.391 to -1.564 -> average?\n   We can compute the overall average of the 96 points: \n        sum = ... (we don't compute exactly, but we can see the values are fluctuating)\n\n  But with only 4 days, it's hard to see a clear trend. So we assume stationarity in the seasonal pattern.\n\n 14. How to handle if there are missing values? In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n 15. We'll compute the hourly means:\n\n      hour0: (2017-04-03 00:00:00: -0.391, 2017-04-04 00:00:00: -0.640, 2017-04-05 00:00:00: -1.777, 2017-04-06 00:00:00: -1.031) -> mean = (-0.391 -0.640 -1.777 -1.031)/4 = -0.95975\n      hour1: (0.071, -0.711, -1.528, -0.604) -> (0.071 -0.711 -1.528 -0.604)/4 = -0.693\n      ... and so on.\n\n 16. Then the forecast for:\n        2017-04-07 00:00:00: use the mean of hour0 -> -0.95975\n        2017-04-07 01:00:00: use the mean of hour1 -> -0.693\n        ... \n        and then repeat the same 24 means for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-04-06. The next 96 hours start at 2017-04-07 00:00:00 and end at 2017-04-10 23:00:00.\n\n 18. We must be:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        date, MULL\n        2017-04-07 00:00:00, [value]\n        2017-04-07 01:00:00, [value]\n        ...\n        2017-04-10 23:00:00, [value]\n\n```\n\n 19. We must compute the 24 hourly means from the 4 days of data:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n 20. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n     hour0: [ -0.391, -0.640, -1.777, -1.031] -> mean = (-0.391 -0.640 -1.777 -1.031)/4 = (-3.839)/4 = -0.95975\n     hour1: [0.071, -0.711, -1.528, -0.604] -> (0.071 -0.711 -1.528 -0.604) = -2.772 -> mean = -0.693\n     hour2: [0.853, -0.391, -1.137, 0.462] -> (0.853 -0.391 -1.137 +0.462) = (0.853+0.462) + (-0.391-1.137) = 1.315 - 1.528 = -0.213 -> mean = -0.213/4? Wait, no: we have 4 values: \n          Actually: 0.853 -0.391 = 0.462; then 0.462 -1.137 = -0.675; then -0.675+0.462 = -0.213 -> then mean = -0.213/4? -> no, we have 4 numbers: \n          total = 0.853 -0.391 -1.137 +0.462 = (0.853+0.462) + (-0.391-1.137) = 1.315 - 1.528 = -0.213 -> then mean = -0.213/4 = -0.05325\n\n     But wait, that doesn't seem right because the numbers are not all negative? Actually, we are adding 4 numbers and then divide by 4.\n\n     Let me recalc: \n        0.853 + (-0.391) + (-1.137) + 0.462 = 0.853 -0.391 = 0.462; 0.462 -1.137 = -0.675; -0.675+0.462 = -0.213 -> then mean = -0.213/4 = -0.05325? \n        Actually, no: we have 4 numbers, so we add them and divide by 4: \n        (0.853 -0.391 -1.137 +0.462) = -0.213 -> then mean = -0.213/4 = -0.05325? That is incorrect: the sum is -0.213, then mean = -0.213/4 = -0.05325? \n        But wait, the sum of the four numbers is -0.213? Then the average is -0.213/4 = -0.05325? \n\n        Actually, the sum of the four numbers is -0.213? Let me do it step by step:\n\n        0.853 + (-0.391) = 0.462\n        0.462 + (-1.137) = -0.675\n        -0.675 + 0.462 = -0.213   -> that's the total. Then average = total / 4 = -0.213/4 = -0.05325.\n\n     But that doesn't match the intuition? Because we have two positive and two negative? \n\n     Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        (0.853 + 0.462) = 1.315\n        (-0.391 -1.137) = -1.528\n        total = 1.315 - 1.528 = -0.213 -> same.\n\n     So the average is -0.05325.\n\n     However, let me check with a calculator:\n\n        0.853 -0.391 = 0.462\n        0.462 -1.137 = -0.675\n        -0.675 +0.462 = -0.213 -> then /4 = -0.05325.\n\n     So we do that for each hour.\n\n 21. We must do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 22. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the mean.\n\n 23. We note that the data is given in order, so:\n\n        hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n        hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73\n        ... \n        hour23: indices 23, 47, 71, 95\n\n 24. The last index is 95 (since 96 points: 0 to 95).\n\n 25. We'll compute:\n\n        hour0: [row0, row24, row48, row72] -> [ -0.391, -0.640, -1.777, -1.031] -> mean = (-0.391 -0.640 -1.777 -1.031)/4 = -3.839/4 = -0.95975\n        hour1: [row1, row25, row49, row73] -> [0.071, -0.711, -1.528, -0.604] -> (0.071 -0.711 -1.528 -0.604) = -2.772 -> mean = -0.693\n        hour2: [row2, row26, row50, row74] -> [0.853, -0.391, -1.137, 0.462] -> 0.853-0.391-1.137+0.462 = -0.213 -> mean = -0.05325\n        hour3: [row3, row27, row51, row75] -> [0.000, -0.391, -1.066, -1.137] -> 0.000 -0.391 -1.066 -1.137 = -2.594 -> mean = -0.6485\n        hour4: [row4, row28, row52, row76] -> [-0.036, -1.883, -1.031, -0.497] -> -0.036 -1.883 -1.031 -0.497 = -3.447 -> mean = -0.86175\n        hour5: [row5, row29, row53, row77] -> [-0.213, -1.599, -1.102, 0.000] -> -0.213-1.599-1.102+0.000 = -2.914 -> mean = -0.7285\n        hour6: [row6, row30, row54, row78] -> [-0.888, -1.492, -1.386, -0.782] -> -0.888-1.492-1.386-0.782 = -4.548 -> mean = -1.137\n        hour7: [row7, row31, row55, row79] -> [-0.746, -1.528, -0.959, -2.203] -> -0.746-1.528-0.959-2.203 = -5.436 -> mean = -1.359\n        hour8: [row8, row32, row56, row80] -> [1.102, -1.954, -0.320, -1.244] -> 1.102 -1.954 -0.320 -1.244 = (1.102) + (-1.954-0.320-1.244) = 1.102 - 3.518 = -2.416 -> mean = -0.604\n        hour9: [row9, row33, row57, row81] -> [1.528, -1.599, -0.853, -1.919] -> 1.528 -1.599 -0.853 -1.919 = (1.528) + (-1.599-0.853-1.919) = 1.528 - 4.371 = -2.843 -> mean = -0.71075\n        hour10: [row10, row34, row58, row82] -> [1.457, -0.995, -1.492, -0.995] -> 1.457 -0.995 -1.492 -0.995 = (1.457) + (-0.995-1.492-0.995) = 1.457 - 3.482 = -2.025 -> mean = -0.50625\n        hour11: [row11, row35, row59, row83] -> [0.142, 0.959, -1.599, -1.137] -> 0.142+0.959-1.599-1.137 = (0.142+0.959)=1.101; ( -1.599-1.137)= -2.736; then 1.101-2.736 = -1.635 -> mean = -0.40875\n        hour12: [row12, row36, row60, row84] -> [-0.284, -1.706, -2.594, -1.528] -> -0.284-1.706-2.594-1.528 = -6.112 -> mean = -1.528\n        hour13: [row13, row37, row61, row85] -> [1.954, -0.853, -1.706, -1.599] -> 1.954 -0.853 -1.706 -1.599 = (1.954) + (-0.853-1.706-1.599) = 1.954 - 4.158 = -2.204 -> mean = -0.551\n        hour14: [row14, row38, row62, row86] -> [1.848, -2.061, -1.279, -1.457] -> 1.848 -2.061 -1.279 -1.457 = (1.848) + (-2.061-1.279-1.457) = 1.848 - 4.797 = -2.949 -> mean = -0.73725\n        hour15: [row15, row39, row63, row87] -> [-0.213, -2.061, -2.097, -1.919] -> -0.213-2.061-2.097-1.919 = -6.29 -> mean = -1.5725\n        hour16: [row16, row40, row64, row88] -> [-1.279, -2.452, -2.381, -1.492] -> -1.279-2.452-2.381-1.492 = -7.604 -> mean = -1.901\n        hour17: [row17, row41, row65, row89] -> [-1.599, -2.132, -2.061, -1.706] -> -1.599-2.132-2.061-1.706 = -7.498 -> mean = -1.8745\n        hour18: [row18, row42, row66, row90] -> [-2.239, -3.020, -2.452, -2.025] -> -2.239-3.020-2.452-2.025 = -9.736 -> mean = -2.434\n        hour19: [row19, row43, row67, row91] -> [-2.132, -3.020, -2.452, -2.345] -> -2.132-3.020-2.452-2.345 = -9.949 -> mean = -2.48725\n        hour20: [row20, row44, row68, row92] -> [-2.203, -3.163, -2.416, -2.345] -> -2.203-3.163-2.416-2.345 = -10.127 -> mean = -2.53175\n        hour21: [row21, row45, row69, row93] -> [-3.305, -3.020, -2.807, -2.914] -> -3.305-3.020-2.807-2.914 = -12.046 -> mean = -3.0115\n        hour22: [row22, row46, row70, row94] -> [-2.097, -1.741, -2.807, -1.883] -> -2.097-1.741-2.807-1.883 = -8.528 -> mean = -2.132\n        hour23: [row23, row47, row71, row95] -> [-1.564, -1.635, -1.564, -0.604] -> -1.564-1.635-1.564-0.604 = -5.367 -> mean = -1.34175\n\n 26. Now, we have 24 means. We will use these means for each hour of the day for the next 4 days.\n\n 27. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-07 (starting at 00:00:00) -> hour0 to hour23: use the means we computed for hour0 to hour23.\n        Day2: 2017-04-08: same means for hour0 to hour23.\n        Day3: 2017-04-09: same.\n        Day4: 2017-04-10: same.\n\n 28. So we generate:\n\n        2017-04-07 00:00:00, -0.95975\n        2017-04-07 01:00:00, -0.693\n        2017-04-07 02:00:00, -0.05325\n        2017-04-07 03:00:00, -0.6485\n        ... until 23:00:00 of 2017-04-07: -1.34175\n\n        Then 2017-04-08 00:00:00: -0.95975\n        ... and so on.\n\n 29. We must be in the same format as the input: two columns: \"date\" and \"MULL\", but note the input had a space and then the value? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2017-04-03 00:00:00 -0.391\"\n\n     But in the output we are to provide, we can use comma separated? The example output format in the instruction was:\n\n        date, MULL\n\n     So we output: \n\n        \"2017-04-07 00:00:00, -0.95975\"\n\n 30. However, note the original data had 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places? \n\n     Since the input had up to 3 decimal places, we round the means to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Let's round:\n\n        hour0: -0.95975 -> -0.960\n        hour1: -0.693 -> -0.693 (but we have 3 decimals: -0.693)\n        hour2: -0.05325 -> -0.053\n        hour3: -0.6485 -> -0.649 (round half up: 0.6485 -> 0.649 in absolute? but negative: -0.6485 -> -0.649? \n                Actually, rounding -0.6485: \n                The rule: 0.6485 * 1000 = 648.5 -> rounds to 649 -> then -0.649)\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places using standard rounding.\n\n 32. We recompute the means for each hour and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. Alternatively, we can use the exact mean and then format to 3 decimal places? \n\n 34. We'll compute the mean and then round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 35. Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: -0.839/4? -> wait, we had -3.839/4 = -0.95975 -> round to 3 decimals: -0.960\n        hour1: -2.772/4 = -0.693 -> -0.693\n        hour2: -0.213/4 = -0.05325 -> -0.053\n        hour3: -2.594/4 = -0.6485 -> -0.649\n        hour4: -3.447/4 = -0.86175 -> -0.862\n        hour5: -2.914/4 = -0.7285 -> -0.729\n        hour6: -4.548/4 = -1.137 -> -1.137 (exactly 3 decimals)\n        hour7: -5.436/4 = -1.359 -> -1.359\n        hour8: -2.416/4 = -0.604 -> -0.604\n        hour9: -2.843/4 = -0.71075 -> -0.711\n        hour10: -2.025/4 = -0.50625 -> -0.506\n        hour11: -1.635/4 = -0.40875 -> -0.409\n        hour12: -6.112/4 = -1.528 -> -1.528\n        hour13: -2.204/4 = -0.551 -> -0.551\n        hour14: -2.949/4 = -0.73725 -> -0.737\n        hour15: -6.29/4 = -1.5725 -> -1.573\n        hour16: -7.604/4 = -1.901 -> -1.901\n        hour17: -7.498/4 = -1.8745 -> -1.875\n        hour18: -9.736/4 = -2.434 -> -2.434\n        hour19: -9.949/4 = -2.48725 -> -2.487\n        hour20: -10.127/4 = -2.53175 -> -2.532\n        hour21: -12.046/4 = -3.0115 -> -3.012\n        hour22: -8.528/4 = -2.132 -> -2.132\n        hour23: -5.367/4 = -1.34175 -> -1.342\n\n 36. Now, we have the 24 values for the day:\n\n        [ -0.960, -0.693, -0.053, -0.649, -0.862, -0.729, -1.137, -1.359, -0.604, -0.711, -0.506, -0.409, -1.528, -0.551, -0.737, -1.573, -1.901, -1.875, -2.434, -2.487, -2.532, -3.012, -2.132, -1.342 ]\n\n 37. Then we repeat this list 4 times for the 4 days.\n\n 38. The dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-07 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-07 01:00:00 ... until 2017-04-10 23:00:00.\n\n 39. We generate the dates:\n\n        day = 7, 8, 9, 10 (April 2017)\n\n        for day in [7,8,9,10]:\n            for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n                date = f\"2017-04-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n 40. But note: the day 7,8,9,10: we must format with two digits.\n\n 41. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 42. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 43. Example of the first few:\n\n        2017-04-07 00:00:00, -0.960\n        2017-04-07 01:00:00, -0.693\n        2017-04-07 02:00:00, -0.053\n        2017-04-07 03:00:00, -0.649\n        ...\n\n 44. We note: the original data had the MULL value with a space? But the instruction says to output in the format:\n\n        date, MULL\n\n     So we use a comma and then a space? \n\n 45. We'll output: \n\n        [date], [value]\n\n     with the value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. Let's code this in the answer.\n\n 47. We write the answer in the required XML-like tag.\n\n 48. Important: the instruction says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 49. We output 96 lines.\n\n 50. We note: the last date in the provided data is 2017-04-06 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-04-07 00:00:00.\n\n 51. We generate:\n\n        Day 7: 2017-04-07\n        Day 8: 2017-04-08\n        Day 9: 2017-04-09\n        Day 10: 2017-04-10\n\n 52. We write the answer.\n",
