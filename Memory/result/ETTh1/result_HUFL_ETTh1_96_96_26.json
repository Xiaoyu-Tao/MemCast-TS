        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2016-10-13 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (24*4)=96, which is 4 days), we can consider a time series model that captures:\n    - Seasonality: There appears to be daily patterns (24-hour cycle) and possibly weekly patterns (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might not be captured).\n    - Trend: We can check for any trend in the 4 days.\n\n 3. Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days ahead, we can use a model that handles multiple seasonality.\n    However, note that we have 4 days (96 points) and we are to forecast 4 days (96 points). This is a long horizon.\n\n 4. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 5. But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern (24 hours). Let's check the pattern:\n\n    - The values drop during the day (around 12:00 to 15:00) and then rise again in the evening and night.\n\n 6. Since we have only 4 days, we might not have enough data to capture weekly seasonality (which would require at least one full week). Therefore, we will model only the daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 7. We can use a SARIMA model with seasonal period 24.\n\n 8. Steps for modeling:\n    a. Check stationarity: We might need to difference the series to make it stationary (both regular and seasonal differencing).\n    b. Identify orders (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24).\n\n 9. However, due to the complexity and the fact that we are to generate 96 points, we can also consider using a simpler model if it fits well.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal model: \n      Forecast for the next day is the same as the same hour of the previous day? But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n      However, note that the pattern might change over the days? \n\n 11. But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly repeating. For example, the peak at night on 2016-10-13 is 10.918, then on 2016-10-14 it is 9.913, then 11.320 on 2016-10-15, and 6.966 on 2016-10-16. \n     So there is a variation.\n\n 12. Given the above, we will use a SARIMA model. We'll choose a model that is known to work well with hourly data: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1)[24].\n\n 13. However, without extensive model selection (due to the small data size and the requirement to forecast 96 points), we can try:\n\n     - We note that the series has a daily pattern and we have 4 days. We can use one seasonal difference (D=1) to remove the daily seasonality.\n\n     - We can try to use auto_arima from pmdarima to select the best parameters? But we are not allowed to run code, so we have to reason.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the past 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? But the trend is not clear.\n\n 15. Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete, we can use them as is.\n\n 16. We decide to use a SARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[24] model: which is equivalent to a seasonal random walk. \n     This model is: \n        y_t = y_{t-24} + e_t\n     So the forecast for the next 24 hours would be the last 24 hours we have (i.e., the 4th day: 2016-10-16 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00).\n     Then the next 24 hours (2016-10-17) would be the same as 2016-10-16, and then 2016-10-18 same as 2016-10-16? \n     But note: we are forecasting 96 hours (4 days). So we can set:\n        Day 5 (2016-10-17) = Day 4 (2016-10-16)\n        Day 6 (2016-10-18) = Day 3 (2016-10-15)  ??? \n     Actually, the model y_t = y_{t-24} would use the same day of the previous cycle? But we only have 4 days. \n\n     However, the model with (0,0,0)(0,1,0)[24] is a seasonal naive model: \n        Forecast for t+1 = value at t+1-24 (i.e., one day before at the same hour)\n\n     But for the first 24 hours of the future (2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-17 23:00:00), we would use the values from 2016-10-16 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n\n     Then for the next 24 hours (2016-10-18 00:00:00 to 2016-10-18 23:00:00), we would use the values from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-17 23:00:00? \n        But we don't have that, we have to use the forecast we just made? \n\n     This would lead to:\n        Day 5 (2016-10-17) = Day 4 (2016-10-16)\n        Day 6 (2016-10-18) = Day 5 (forecast) = Day 4 -> same as Day 4 again.\n\n     So the entire forecast would be 4 repetitions of the last day? \n\n     But that might not be the best, because the pattern of the last day (2016-10-16) is different from the previous days.\n\n 17. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n\n     For example, for 00:00:00:         (11.320, 13.396, 9.511, 13.731) -> average = (11.32+13.396+9.511+13.731)/4 = 11.9895\n     Then for 01:00:00: (10.181, 14.267, 9.176, 13.731) -> average = (10.181+14.267+9.176+13.731)/4 = 11.83875\n\n     But note: the last day (2016-10-16) has a lower value at 23:00:00 (6.966) compared to the previous days (10.918, 9.913, 11.320). \n     the average for 23:00:00 would be (10.918+9.913+11.320+6.966)/4 = 9.77925.\n\n     Then we can set the entire next 4 days (96 hours) to be the same: each hour of the day is the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n     But this would be a constant daily pattern repeated 4 days.\n\n 18. However, we note that the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        Day2: ... etc.\n\n     We can compute the daily average:\n\n        Day1 (2016-10-13): \n            sum = 11.320+10.181+10.248+8.908+10.114+9.444+10.181+9.712+9.377+6.899+7.770+7.703+4.957+6.162+7.301+6.095+6.765+7.435+6.564+6.497+5.559+6.631+8.573+10.918\n            = 193.265 / 24 = 8.0527\n\n        Day2 (2016-10-14): \n            = 13.396+14.267+14.401+14.267+13.597+13.731+15.941+14.937+10.717+7.770+8.774+8.239+5.626+6.229+7.100+6.631+6.095+7.904+6.966+6.631+5.760+5.090+4.823+9.913\n            = 218.308 / 24 = 9.096166\n\n        Day3 (2016-10-15): \n            = 9.511+9.176+8.172+7.636+9.176+9.310+10.248+11.655+9.042+6.765+8.707+8.239+5.894+6.229+5.291+6.430+5.827+7.033+6.832+6.564+6.028+7.837+8.172+11.320\n            = 194.184 / 24 = 8.091\n\n        Day4 (2016-10-16): \n            = 13.731+13.731+12.860+13.865+13.195+12.860+13.932+11.588+8.172+6.430+7.435+7.703+4.890+6.095+5.224+5.224+5.894+6.698+6.430+5.961+5.358+4.555+6.564+6.966\n            = 201.000 / 24 = 8.375\n\n     The daily averages: 8.05, 9.10, 8.09, 8.38 -> no clear trend? \n\n 19. Given the above, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile, and then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n     So the forecast for any hour h (where h from 0 to 23) in the future is the average of the h-th hour of the 4 days.\n\n     Then the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the same daily profile repeated 4 times.\n\n 20. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (11.320, 13.396, 9.511, 13.731) -> (11.320+13.396+9.511+13.731)/4 = 11.9895\n        hour1: (10.181, 14.267, 9.176, 13.731) -> (10.181+14.267+9.176+13.731)/4 = 11.83875\n        hour2: (10.248, 14.401, 8.172, 12.860) -> (10.248+14.401+8.172+12.860)/4 = 11.42025\n        hour3: (8.908, 14.267, 7.636, 13.865) -> (8.908+14.267+7.636+13.865)/4 = 11.169\n        hour4: (10.114, 13.597, 9.176, 13.195) -> (10.114+13.597+9.176+13.195)/4 = 11.5205\n        hour5: (9.444, 13.731, 9.310, 12.860) -> (9.444+13.731+9.310+12.860)/4 = 11.33625\n        hour6: (10.181, 15.941, 10.248, 13.932) -> (10.181+15.941+10.248+13.932)/4 = 12.5755\n        hour7: (9.712, 14.937, 11.655, 11.588) -> (9.712+14.937+11.655+11.588)/4 = 11.973\n        hour8: (9.377, 10.717, 9.042, 8.172) -> (9.377+10.717+9.042+8.172)/4 = 9.327\n        hour9: (6.899, 7.770, 6.765, 6.430) -> (6.899+7.770+6.765+6.430)/4 = 6.966\n        hour10: (7.770, 8.774, 8.707, 7.435) -> (7.770+8.774+8.707+7.435)/4 = 8.1715\n        hour11: (7.703, 8.239, 8.239, 7.703) -> (7.703+8.239+8.239+7.703)/4 = 7.971\n        hour12: (4.957, 5.626, 5.894, 4.890) -> (4.957+5.626+5.894+4.890)/4 = 5.34175\n        hour13: (6.162, 6.229, 6.229, 6.095) -> (6.162+6.229+6.229+6.095)/4 = 6.17875\n        hour14: (7.301, 7.100, 5.291, 5.224) -> (7.301+7.100+5.291+5.224)/4 = 6.229\n        hour15: (6.095, 6.631, 6.430, 5.224) -> (6.095+6.631+6.430+5.224)/4 = 6.095\n        hour16: (6.765, 6.095, 5.827, 5.894) -> (6.765+6.095+5.827+5.894)/4 = 6.14525\n        hour17: (7.435, 7.904, 7.033, 6.698) -> (7.435+7.904+7.033+6.698)/4 = 7.2675\n        hour18: (6.564, 6.966, 6.832, 6.430) -> (6.564+6.966+6.832+6.430)/4 = 6.698\n        hour19: (6.497, 6.631, 6.564, 5.961) -> (6.497+6.631+6.564+5.961)/4 = 6.41325\n        hour20: (5.559, 5.760, 6.028, 5.358) -> (5.559+5.760+6.028+5.358)/4 = 5.67625\n        hour21: (6.631, 5.090, 7.837, 4.555) -> (6.631+5.090+7.837+4.555)/4 = 6.02825\n        hour22: (8.573, 4.823, 8.172, 6.564) -> (8.573+4.823+8.172+6.564)/4 = 7.033\n        hour23: (10.918, 9.913, 11.320, 6.966) -> (10.918+9.913+11.320+6.966)/4 = 9.77925\n\n 21. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-10-17): \n            00:00:00 -> 11.9895\n            01:00:00 -> 11.83875\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 9.77925\n\n        Day2 (2016-10-18): same as above\n        Day3 (2016-10-19): same as above\n        Day4 (2016-10-20): same as above\n\n 22. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are not given any in the provided 96 points. We are using the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 23. We output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 24. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates.\n\n Implementation:\n\n     We'll create a list of the 24 average values (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 25. The dates: \n        The last date in the given data is 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n        The next 96 hours start at 2016-10-17 00:00:00 and go to 2016-10-20 23:00:00.\n\n 26. Format: \n        We must output in the same way as the input: two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL', with the date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 27. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-17 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-10-17 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-10-17 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Then 2016-10-18 00:00:00 to 2016-10-18 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2016-10-19 00:00:00 to 2016-10-19 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2016-10-20 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00 -> next 24\n\n 28. The HUFL values: we have a list of 24 values (the averages) and we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 29. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-17 00:00:00 11.9895\n2016-10-17 01:00:00 11.83875\n...\n2016-10-20 23:00:00 9.77925\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 30. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We should round to 3 decimal places? \n\n     The original data had 3 decimal places, so we will round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Let's recalculate the averages with rounding to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: (11.320+13.396+9.511+13.731)/4 = 48.958 / 4 = 12.2395 -> 12.240? \n        But wait, let me recalc:\n\n        11.320 + 13.396 = 24.716\n        24.716 + 9.511 = 34.227\n        34.227 + 13.731 = 47.958 -> 47.958/4 = 11.9895 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 11.990\n\n        Actually, 11.9895 rounded to 3 decimals: \n            look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> round up: 11.990\n\n        Similarly, hour1: 11.83875 -> 11.839\n\n        We'll do for each.\n\n 32. Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places by formatting the number to have 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. We'll recalc and round each to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 11.320+13.396+9.511+13.731 = 47.958 -> 47.958/4 = 11.9895 -> 11.990\n        But note: 11.9895 rounded to 3 decimals: \n            The third decimal is 9, the next is 5 -> so 9 becomes 10 -> so 11.990.\n\n        hour1: 10.181+14.267+9.176+13.731 = 47.355 -> 47.355/4 = 11.83875 -> 11.839\n        hour2: 10.248+14.401+8.172+12.860 = 45.681 -> 45.681/4 = 11.42025 -> 11.420\n        hour3: 8.908+14.267+7.636+13.865 = 44.676 -> 44.676/4 = 11.169 -> 11.169\n        hour4: 10.114+13.597+9.176+13.195 = 46.082 -> 46.082/4 = 11.5205 -> 11.521\n        hour5: 9.444+13.731+9.310+12.860 = 45.345 -> 45.345/4 = 11.33625 -> 11.336\n        hour6: 10.181+15.941+10.248+13.932 = 50.302 -> 50.302/4 = 12.5755 -> 12.576\n        hour7: 9.712+14.937+11.655+11.588 = 47.892 -> 47.892/4 = 11.973 -> 11.973\n        hour8: 9.377+10.717+9.042+8.172 = 37.308 -> 37.308/4 = 9.327 -> 9.327\n        hour9: 6.899+7.770+6.765+6.430 = 27.864 -> 27.864/4 = 6.966 -> 6.966\n        hour10: 7.770+8.774+8.707+7.435 = 32.686 -> 32.686/4 = 8.1715 -> 8.172\n        hour11: 7.703+8.239+8.239+7.703 = 31.884 -> 31.884/4 = 7.971 -> 7.971\n        hour12: 4.957+5.626+5.894+4.890 = 21.367 -> 21.367/4 = 5.34175 -> 5.342\n        hour13: 6.162+6.229+6.229+6.095 = 24.715 -> 24.715/4 = 6.17875 -> 6.179\n        hour14: 7.301+7.100+5.291+5.224 = 24.916 -> 24.916/4 = 6.229 -> 6.229\n        hour15: 6.095+6.631+6.430+5.224 = 24.380 -> 24.380/4 = 6.095 -> 6.095\n        hour16: 6.765+6.095+5.827+5.894 = 24.581 -> 24.581/4 = 6.14525 -> 6.145\n        hour17: 7.435+7.904+7.033+6.698 = 29.070 -> 29.070/4 = 7.2675 -> 7.268\n        hour18: 6.564+6.966+6.832+6.430 = 26.792 -> 26.792/4 = 6.698 -> 6.698\n        hour19: 6.497+6.631+6.564+5.961 = 25.653 -> 25.653/4 = 6.41325 -> 6.413\n        hour20: 5.559+5.760+6.028+5.358 = 22.705 -> 22.705/4 = 5.67625 -> 5.676\n        hour21: 6.631+5.090+7.837+4.555 = 24.113 -> 24.113/4 = 6.02825 -> 6.028\n        hour22: 8.573+4.823+8.172+6.564 = 28.132 -> 28.132/4 = 7.033 -> 7.033\n        hour23: 10.918+9.913+11.320+6.966 = 39.117 -> 39.117/4 = 9.77925 -> 9.779\n\n 34. So the 24-hour profile:\n\n        hour0: 11.990\n        hour1: 11.839\n        hour2: 11.420\n        hour3: 11.169\n        hour4: 11.521\n        hour5: 11.336\n        hour6: 12.576\n        hour7: 11.973\n        hour8: 9.327\n        hour9: 6.966\n        hour10: 8.172\n        hour11: 7.971\n        hour12: 5.342\n        hour13: 6.179\n        hour14: 6.229\n        hour15: 6.095\n        hour16: 6.145\n        hour17: 7.268\n        hour18: 6.698\n        hour19: 6.413\n        hour20: 5.676\n        hour21: 6.028\n        hour22: 7.033\n        hour23: 9.779\n\n 35. Now we generate the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-17 00:00:00 to 2016-10-17 23:00:00: the above 24 values in order.\n        Day2: 2016-10-18 00:00:00 to 2016-10-18 23:00:00: the same 24 values.\n        Day3: 2016-10-19 00:00:00 to 2016-10-19 23:00:00: the same 24 values.\n        Day4: 2016-10-20 00:00:00 to 2016-10-20 23:00:00: the same 24 values.\n\n 36. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 37. Note: We are not using a sophisticated model because of the limited data and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days). \n     This method is simple and captures the daily pattern.\n\n 38. If we had more data, we might use a more advanced model, but with 4 days, this is reasonable.\n\n Let's output the data.\n",
