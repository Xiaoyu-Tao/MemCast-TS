        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations), we can consider a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components.\n\n 5. However, note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components.\n\n 6. But with only 4 days, it is challenging to fit a complex model. We might use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour from the previous days to forecast the next days.\n\n Approach:\n Since we have exactly 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n The data from 2017-01-13 to 2017-01-16: \n   We see that the values are negative and the pattern is similar each day but with some variation.\n\n But looking at the last day (2017-01-16) we see that the values are generally more negative? \n\n However, without more data, it's hard to capture a trend. \n\n Considering the constraints, a reasonable approach is to use the average of the same hour for the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days will be:\n        forecast_h = average of the h-th hour from the 4 days we have.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In our case, the provided 96 points are complete, so we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n However, let's check if there is a trend? We can try to remove the daily seasonality and then model the trend? But with only 4 days, it's very short.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-16) as the forecast for the next day? But the problem asks for 4 days.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a forecast, we choose the following:\n\n   We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Why?\n   - It captures the daily seasonality.\n   - It smooths out some of the noise.\n\n But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data to capture weekly (only 4 days, not even a full week). So we ignore weekly.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n   Step 2: For the next 4 days (2017-01-17 to 2017-01-20), for each day, assign the 24 hourly values as the computed average for that hour.\n\n Example:\n   For hour 0: average of [2017-01-13 00:00:00, 2017-01-14 00:00:00, 2017-01-15 00:00:00, 2017-01-16 00:00:00] = (-0.355 + -0.391 + -0.178 + 0.142) / 4 = ?\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then take the mean.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24 average values for each day.\n\n   The dates will be from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n\n 8. However, note that the data might have a trend? We don't have enough to model it. So we assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 9. We must output the data in the same format, with the next 96 dates and the forecasted MULL values.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   Hour 0: (-0.355, -0.391, -0.178, 0.142) -> mean = (-0.355 -0.391 -0.178 +0.142)/4 = (-0.782) / 4 = -0.1955\n   Hour 1: (-0.782, -0.320, 0.178, -0.391) -> (-0.782 -0.320 +0.178 -0.391) = (-1.315) /4 = -0.32875\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days, we will have:\n\n   2017-01-17 00:00:00: -0.1955\n   2017-01-17 01:00:00: -0.32875\n   ... until 2017-01-17 23:00:00: [average for hour 23]\n\n   and then repeat the same 24 values for 2017-01-18, 2017-01-19, 2017-01-20.\n\n 10. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n However, if we were to handle missing values in the future, we would need to impute. But the problem does not specify how to handle missing values in the forecast period? \n We are only forecasting, so we don't have missing values in the future? We are generating the next 96 points.\n\n 11. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and then compute the mean.\n\n   We have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places.\n\n Implementation in code (if we were coding) but we are to write the answer.\n\n Since we are to output the data, we can compute the averages manually? But 24 hours * 4 days = 96 points, and then we have to output 96 points.\n\n Alternatively, we can write a small program in our mind.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the complete data.\n\n We'll compute the hourly averages:\n\n   Hour 0: [ -0.355, -0.391, -0.178, 0.142 ] -> sum = -0.355 -0.391 = -0.746; -0.746 -0.178 = -0.924; -0.924 +0.142 = -0.782 -> mean = -0.782/4 = -0.1955 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.196\n\n   Hour 1: [ -0.782, -0.320, 0.178, -0.391 ] -> \n        -0.782 -0.320 = -1.102\n        -1.102 +0.178 = -0.924\n        -0.924 -0.391 = -1.315 -> mean = -1.315/4 = -0.32875 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.329\n\n   Hour 2: [ -0.711, -0.355, 0.213, 0.497 ] -> \n        -0.711 -0.355 = -1.066\n        -1.066 +0.213 = -0.853\n        -0.853 +0.497 = -0.356 -> mean = -0.356/4 = -0.089\n\n   Hour 3: [ -0.853, -1.244, -1.102, -0.959 ] -> \n        -0.853 -1.244 = -2.097\n        -2.097 -1.102 = -3.199\n        -3.199 -0.959 = -4.158 -> mean = -4.158/4 = -1.0395 -> rounded to -1.040\n\n   But wait, let me recalculate hour 3: \n        values: -0.853, -1.244, -1.102, -0.959\n        sum = -0.853 -1.244 = -2.097; -2.097 -1.102 = -3.199; -3.199 -0.959 = -4.158 -> -4.158/4 = -1.0395 -> -1.040 (if rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n   However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places, so we should round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a table.\n\n   But note: we are to output 96 points. We can compute the 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n   We'll compute the 24 averages and then the forecast for 2017-01-17 to 2017-01-20 will be:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-01-17): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n   Day 2 (2017-01-18): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n   Day 3 (2017-01-19): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n   Day 4 (2017-01-20): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n 12. We must generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-17 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-01-17 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n\n 13. We'll compute the averages for each hour (0: -0.196\n1: -0.329\n2: -0.089\n3: -1.040\n4: (-1.350 + -1.421 + -0.213 + -0.178) = (-1.350-1.421=-2.771; -2.771-0.213=-2.984; -2.984-0.178=-3.162) -> -3.162/4 = -0.7905 -> -0.791\n5: (-1.137 + -1.457 + 0.178 + -0.604) = (-1.137-1.457=-2.594; -2.594+0.178=-2.416; -2.416-0.604=-3.02) -> -3.02/4 = -0.755\n6: (-1.031 + -1.421 + -0.178 + -1.066) = (-1.031-1.421=-2.452; -2.452-0.178=-2.63; -2.63-1.066=-3.696) -> -3.696/4 = -0.924\n7: (-1.599 + -0.711 + -0.569 + -0.675) = (-1.599-0.711=-2.31; -2.31-0.569=-2.879; -2.879-0.675=-3.554) -> -3.554/4 = -0.8885 -> -0.889\n8: (-1.492 + -0.426 + -0.142 + -0.391) = (-1.492-0.426=-1.918; -1.918-0.142=-2.06; -2.06-0.391=-2.451) -> -2.451/4 = -0.61275 -> -0.613\n9: (-1.350 + -0.995 + -0.746 + -0.142) = (-1.350-0.995=-2.345; -2.345-0.746=-3.091; -3.091-0.142=-3.233) -> -3.233/4 = -0.80825 -> -0.808\n10: (-1.457 + -2.203 + -0.426 + -1.315) = (-1.457-2.203=-3.66; -3.66-0.426=-4.086; -4.086-1.315=-5.401) -> -5.401/4 = -1.35025 -> -1.350\n11: (-1.173 + -0.995 + -0.426 + -1.421) = (-1.173-0.995=-2.168; -2.168-0.426=-2.594; -2.594-1.421=-4.015) -> -4.015/4 = -1.00375 -> -1.004\n12: (-1.848 + -1.031 + -0.746 + -1.492) = (-1.848-1.031=-2.879; -2.879-0.746=-3.625; -3.625-1.492=-5.117) -> -5.117/4 = -1.27925 -> -1.279\n13: (-1.102 + -0.711 + -0.533 + -0.533) = (-1.102-0.711=-1.813; -1.813-0.533=-2.346; -2.346-0.533=-2.879) -> -2.879/4 = -0.71975 -> -0.720\n14: (-1.279 + -0.497 + -0.711 + -1.386) = (-1.279-0.497=-1.776; -1.776-0.711=-2.487; -2.487-1.386=-3.873) -> -3.873/4 = -0.96825 -> -0.968\n15: (-1.848 + -1.102 + -1.208 + -1.954) = (-1.848-1.102=-2.95; -2.95-1.208=-4.158; -4.158-1.954=-6.112) -> -6.112/4 = -1.528\n16: (-2.168 + -1.066 + -1.635 + -2.345) = (-2.168-1.066=-3.234; -3.234-1.635=-4.869; -4.869-2.345=-7.214) -> -7.214/4 = -1.8035 -> -1.804\n17: (-2.452 + -1.599 + -1.777 + -2.381) = (-2.452-1.599=-4.051; -4.051-1.777=-5.828; -5.828-2.381=-8.209) -> -8.209/4 = -2.05225 -> -2.052\n18: (-2.381 + -1.777 + -2.025 + -2.701) = (-2.381-1.777=-4.158; -4.158-2.025=-6.183; -6.183-2.701=-8.884) -> -8.884/4 = -2.221\n19: (-1.741 + -1.457 + -1.670 + -2.132) = (-1.741-1.457=-3.198; -3.198-1.670=-4.868; -4.868-2.132=-7.0) -> -7.0/4 = -1.75\n20: (-1.670 + -1.777 + -1.919 + -2.168) = (-1.670-1.777=-3.447; -3.447-1.919=-5.366; -5.366-2.168=-7.534) -> -7.534/4 = -1.8835 -> -1.884\n21: (-2.416 + -2.203 + -2.452 + -1.741) = (-2.416-2.203=-4.619; -4.619-2.452=-7.071; -7.071-1.741=-8.812) -> -8.812/4 = -2.203\n22: (-0.853 + -1.599 + -1.102 + -0.391) = (-0.853-1.599=-2.452; -2.452-1.102=-3.554; -3.554-0.391=-3.945) -> -3.945/4 = -0.98625 -> -0.986\n23: (-0.036 + -0.142 + 0.036 + -0.213) = (-0.036-0.142=-0.178; -0.178+0.036=-0.142; -0.142-0.213=-0.355) -> -0.355/4 = -0.08875 -> -0.089\n\n Now, we have the 24 averages:\n\n  0: -0.196\n  1: -0.329\n  2: -0.089\n  3: -1.040\n  4: -0.791\n  5: -0.755\n  6: -0.924\n  7: -0.889\n  8: -0.613\n  9: -0.808\n  10: -1.350\n  11: -1.004\n  12: -1.279\n  13: -0.720\n  14: -0.968\n  15: -1.528\n  16: -1.804\n  17: -2.052\n  18: -2.221\n  19: -1.750\n  20: -1.884\n  21: -2.203\n  22: -0.986\n  23: -0.089\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-01-17 00:00:00: -0.196\n          2017-01-17 01:00:00: -0.329\n          ... until 2017-01-17 23:00:00: -0.089\n\n   Day 2: 2017-01-18 00:00:00: -0.196\n          2017-01-18 01:00:00: -0.329\n          ... \n\n   Day 3: same as day1 and day2\n\n   Day 4: same.\n\n 14.
