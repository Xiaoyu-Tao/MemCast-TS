        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing entries (each hour is present). So we assume the data is complete for the given period.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours. The last timestamp is 2017-06-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series forecasting model. Given the limited data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we need a model that can handle this.\n\n 4. We note that the data shows a daily pattern (diurnal variation) and possibly weekly? But we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern might not be captured.\n\n 5. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality. However, we have only 4 days (96 points) and we want to forecast 4 days (96 points). This is a challenge because we have very little data to capture seasonality.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality? But the data shows clear daily cycles.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a model with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n 8. We can use the `statsmodels` library in Python to fit a SARIMA model. However, since we are to provide the forecast without coding, we must simulate the process.\n\n 9. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any in the provided 96, so we assume the provided segment is complete.\n\n 10. We must generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n 11. However, without running actual code, we can describe the process and then provide the forecast. But the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 12. Since I cannot run code in this environment, I will generate a forecast using a naive method? But that would not be accurate.\n\n 13. Alternatively, I can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? Let's try:\n\n     For example, the hour 00:00:00 of 2017-06-14 would be the average of the 00:00:00 of the previous 4 days? But we only have 4 days (from 10th to 13th). So we can take the average of the same hour for the 4 days we have.\n\n     However, note that the data might have a trend? We don't have enough to see a trend.\n\n 14. Let's check the data for the same hour:\n\n     Hour 00:00:00:\n        2017-06-10: 13.507\n        2017-06-11: 16.391\n        2017-06-12: 15.336\n        2017-06-13: 14.562\n\n     Average = (13.507 + 16.391 + 15.336 + 14.562) / 4 = 14.796\n\n     Similarly, for hour 01:00:00:\n        2017-06-10: 14.351\n        2017-06-11: 17.024\n        2017-06-12: 15.054\n        2017-06-13: 14.632\n        Average = (14.351+17.024+15.054+14.632)/4 = 15.26525\n\n 15. But note: the data on 2017-06-10 (Saturday) and 2017-06-11 (Sunday) might be weekend? and 2017-06-12 and 2017-06-13 are weekdays? So the pattern might be different.\n\n 16. However, we only have 4 days and we don't know the exact pattern. We can try to use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days? or use the last day (2017-06-13) as the pattern? \n\n 17. Another idea: use a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights? For example, weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] for the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th respectively.\n\n 18. But without more data, it's hard. We are forced to use a simple method.\n\n 19. We'll use the average of the same hour for the 4 available days.\n\n 20. However, note that the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n 21. We generate the next 96 points (from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00) by:\n\n     For each hour in the day (0 to 23) for the next 4 days, we compute the average of that same hour from the 4 days we have.\n\n 22. But note: the next 4 days are 2017-06-14 (Wednesday), 2017-06-15 (Thursday), 2017-06-16 (Friday), 2017-06-17 (Saturday). The first day of our forecast (2017-06-14) is a Wednesday, but our historical data includes Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? \n\n     Let me check: \n        2017-06-10: Saturday\n        2017-06-11: Sunday\n        2017-06-12: Monday\n        2017-06-13: Tuesday\n\n     So the next days: \n        2017-06-14: Wednesday -> we don't have Wednesday in the history? \n        2017-06-15: Thursday\n        2017-06-16: Friday\n        2017-06-17: Saturday -> we have one Saturday (2017-06-10) in the history.\n\n 23. This method would ignore the day of the week? So we are just averaging the same hour of the last 4 days regardless of the day of the week.\n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the same day of the week? But we only have one Saturday, one Sunday, one Monday, one Tuesday. Then for Wednesday, we don't have any. So we cannot do that.\n\n 25. Therefore, we stick to the same hour average of the last 4 days.\n\n 26. Steps:\n\n     Let H0, H1, H2, H3 be the data for the same hour from the 4 days (2017-06-10, 2017-06-11, 2017-06-12, 2017-06-13).\n\n     Then the forecast for that hour for the next 4 days (2017-06-14 to 2017-06-17) will be the same: the average of H0, H1, H2, H3.\n\n     But wait, that would give the same value for the same hour in each of the next 4 days? \n\n     For example, for hour 00:00:00, we will have the same value for 2017-06-14, 2017-06-15, 2017-06-16, 2017-06-17? That is, the forecast for 00:00:00 for each of the next 4 days is 14.796.\n\n     That would be a flat forecast for each hour across the days? That might not be realistic because the temperature might vary by day.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can use the average pattern of the last 4 days and then adjust by a trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 28. Given the complexity and the lack of data, we might use a naive seasonal forecast: use the last day (2017-06-13) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have to forecast 4 days.\n\n     We can use the same pattern of 2017-06-13 for 2017-06-14, then 2017-06-15, etc. But that would be the same as the last day? \n\n 29. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, and then for the next 4 days, we use that average pattern repeated 4 times? \n\n     That is, the forecast for 2017-06-14 00:00:00 = average of 00:00:00 of the 4 days\n     ... until 2017-06-14 23:00:00 = average of 23:00:00 of the 4 days.\n\n     Then for 2017-06-15, we use the same set of averages? and so on.\n\n 30. This method would give the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 31. We'll do that.\n\n 32. Calculate the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     Hour 0: (13.507 + 16.391001 + 15.336 + 14.562) / 4 = (13.507+16.391+15.336+14.562)/4 = 59.796001/4 = 14.94900025\n     Hour 1: (14.351 + 17.024 + 15.054 + 14.632) /4 = (14.351+17.024+15.054+14.632)=61.061/4=15.26525\n     ... and so on.\n\n 33. Then the forecast for:\n        2017-06-14 00:00:00: 14.949\n        2017-06-14 01:00:00: 15.265\n        ... \n        and then for 2017-06-15 00:00:00: again 14.949\n        and so on.\n\n 34. But note: the data might have a slight downward trend? The hour0 values: 13.507, 16.391, 15.336, 14.562 -> it went down. So the average might be a bit high for the next days? But we are not accounting for trend.\n\n 35. Given the ability to capture trend with such a short history is limited, we proceed with the average.\n\n 36. We must calculate the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 37. Let me compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    We have 4 days, 24 hours per day -> 24 averages.\n\n    We'll index the hours from 0 to 23.\n\n    For hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        values: [13.507, 16.391001, 15.336, 14.562] -> sum = 13.507+16.391001+15.336+14.562 = 59.796001 -> avg = 14.94900025\n\n    For hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        values: [14.351, 17.024, 15.054, 14.632] -> sum = 14.351+17.024+15.054+14.632 = 61.061 -> avg = 15.26525\n\n    For hour 2 (02:00:00):\n        values: [17.657, 16.601999, 14.280, 14.421] -> sum = 17.657+16.602+14.280+14.421 = 62.96 -> avg = 15.74\n\n    For hour 3 (03:00:00):\n        values: [18.150, 16.461, 13.858, 14.351] -> sum = 18.150+16.461+13.858+14.351 = 62.82 -> avg = 15.705\n\n    For hour 4 (04:00:00):\n        values: [11.889, 15.898, 14.210, 14.351] -> sum = 11.889+15.898+14.210+14.351 = 56.348 -> avg = 14.087\n\n    For hour 5 (05:00:00):\n        values: [15.265, 15.125, 14.632, 14.140] -> sum = 15.265+15.125+14.632+14.140 = 59.162 -> avg = 14.7905\n\n    For hour 6 (06:00:00):\n        values: [11.889, 14.984, 14.703, 14.140] -> sum = 11.889+14.984+14.703+14.140 = 55.716 -> avg = 13.929\n\n    For hour 7 (07:00:00):\n        values: [12.381, 12.803, 14.421, 13.929] -> sum = 12.381+12.803+14.421+13.929 = 53.534 -> avg = 13.3835\n\n    For hour 8 (08:00:00):\n        values: [15.265, 14.421, 14.773, 13.999] -> sum = 15.265+14.421+14.773+13.999 = 58.458 -> avg = 14.6145\n\n    For hour 9 (09:00:00):\n        values: [17.165001, 15.054, 14.773, 14.140] -> sum = 17.165001+15.054+14.773+14.140 = 61.132001 -> avg = 15.28300025\n\n    For hour 10 (10:00:00):\n        values: [17.235001, 15.265, 14.703, 13.366] -> sum = 17.235001+15.265+14.703+13.366 = 60.569001 -> avg = 15.14225025\n\n    For hour 11 (11:00:00):\n        values: [17.305, 15.758, 15.336, 13.929] -> sum = 17.305+15.758+15.336+13.929 = 62.328 -> avg = 15.582\n\n    For hour 12 (12:00:00):\n        values: [14.703, 16.320999, 15.406, 13.647] -> sum = 14.703+16.320999+15.406+13.647 = 60.076999 -> avg = 15.01924975\n\n    For hour 13 (13:00:00):\n        values: [18.431, 16.813, 15.758, 14.280] -> sum = 18.431+16.813+15.758+14.280 = 65.282 -> avg = 16.3205\n\n    For hour 14 (14:00:00):\n        values: [19.275, 18.009001, 15.758, 14.491] -> sum = 19.275+18.009001+15.758+14.491 = 67.533001 -> avg = 16.88325025\n\n    For hour 15 (15:00:00):\n        values: [14.703, 17.726999, 15.687, 14.562] -> sum = 14.703+17.726999+15.687+14.562 = 62.678999 -> avg = 15.66974975\n\n    For hour 16 (16:00:00):\n        values: [13.436, 17.657, 15.758, 14.632] -> sum = 13.436+17.657+15.758+14.632 = 61.483 -> avg = 15.37075\n\n    For hour 17 (17:00:00):\n        values: [11.537, 18.712, 15.406, 14.562] -> sum = 11.537+18.712+15.406+14.562 = 60.217 -> avg = 15.05425\n\n    For hour 18 (18:00:00):\n        values: [13.788, 17.587, 15.547, 14.632] -> sum = 13.788+17.587+15.547+14.632 = 61.554 -> avg = 15.3885\n\n    For hour 19 (19:00:00):\n        values: [15.054, 17.657, 15.687, 14.773] -> sum = 15.054+17.657+15.687+14.773 = 63.171 -> avg = 15.79275\n\n    For hour 20 (20:00:00):\n        values: [15.195, 17.375999, 15.195, 14.703] -> sum = 15.195+17.375999+15.195+14.703 = 62.468999 -> avg = 15.61724975\n\n    For hour 21 (21:00:00):\n        values: [16.250, 16.954, 15.336, 15.125] -> sum = 16.250+16.954+15.336+15.125 = 63.665 -> avg = 15.91625\n\n    For hour 22 (22:00:00):\n        values: [17.024, 16.250, 15.265, 14.632] -> sum = 17.024+16.250+15.265+14.632 = 63.171 -> avg = 15.79275\n\n    For hour 23 (23:00:00):\n        values: [16.813, 16.250, 14.703, 15.125] -> sum = 16.813+16.250+14.703+15.125 = 62.891 -> avg = 15.72275\n\n 38. Now, we will create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating these 24 average values for each day.\n\n 39. The next 96 timestamps:\n\n     2017-06-14 00:00:00 -> hour0: 14.949\n     2017-06-14 01:00:00 -> hour1: 15.265\n     ... until 2017-06-14 23:00:00: 15.72275\n\n     Then 2017-06-15 00:00:00: 14.949\n     ... and so on.\n\n 40. We must format the dates correctly.\n\n 41. The last date in the given data is 2017-06-13 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-06-14 00:00:00.\n\n 42. We'll create 96 rows.\n\n 43. We'll output the data in the same format: two columns: \"date\" and \"OT\", with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 44. We'll round the OT values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 45. Let's write the data:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-06-14\n        hour0: 14.949\n        hour1: 15.265\n        ... \n\n     But note: the averages we computed are in more precision. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n     However, the input had 3 decimal places, but note that some values had 6 decimal places? Actually, they were given with 3 decimal places (like 13.507000 -> 13.507). So we can output with 3 decimals.\n\n 46. We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. Let me recompute the averages rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n     hour0: 14.949\n     hour1: 15.265\n     hour2: 15.740\n     hour3: 15.705\n     hour4: 14.087\n     hour5: 14.791   (because 14.7905 -> 14.791)\n     hour6: 13.929\n     hour7: 13.384   (13.3835 -> 13.384)\n     hour8: 14.615   (14.6145 -> 14.615)\n     hour9: 15.283\n     hour10: 15.142\n     hour11: 15.582\n     hour12: 15.019\n     hour13: 16.321\n     hour14: 16.883\n     hour15: 15.670\n     hour16: 15.371\n     hour17: 15.054\n     hour18: 15.389\n     hour19: 15.793\n     hour20: 15.617\n     hour21: 15.916\n     hour22: 15.793\n     hour23: 15.723\n\n 48. Now, we write the next 96 points.\n\n 49. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-06-14 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-06-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n 50. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 51. The first 24 (day1: 2017-06-14) will be the 24 averages in order.\n     The next 24 (day2: 2017-06-15) will be the same 24 averages.\n     Then day3: 2017-06-16: same\n     Then day4: 2017-06-17: same.\n\n 52. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-06-14 00:00:00 14.949\n2017-06-14 01:00:00 15.265\n... \n2017-06-17 23:00:00 15.723\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 53. We must be careful: the date format is exactly as given.\n\n 54. Let me write the first few and last few.\n\n 55. We'll generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 56. Note: We are not using any sophisticated model due to the constraints, but this method is simple and common for very short-term forecasting with limited data.\n\n 57. We output the data.\n",
