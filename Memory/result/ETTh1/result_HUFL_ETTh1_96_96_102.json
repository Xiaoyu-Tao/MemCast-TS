        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there are missing values in the provided data? \n    However, the provided data for the past 96 dates does not to have missing values? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. But in the provided 96 points, we see no missing? \n    Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n    It might be that the data we are going to forecast might have missing? But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must provide 96 values without missing.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 values, we choose a model that can extrapolate the patterns.\n\n 4. We observe that the data has:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Some negative values? (which is acceptable for temperature, but note that the load might be normalized)\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal model. Since we are limited by the data (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (last 24 hours) as forecast for the next 24 hours, but repeated for 4 days? \n      However, the data does not look exactly repeating. \n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonal components. But with only 96 points, \n    fitting a complex model might be challenging.\n\n 7. However, note that the problem says the dataset is subdivided and we are only given a part. We don't have the entire history.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we must provide 96 values. We can use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual, then forecast each component.\n\n 9. But since we are to write code and we are an assistant, we cannot run code. We have to reason and then output the 96 numbers.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n     - The last 24 hours (2017-08-16 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00) are:\n        [13.932, 13.664, 13.329, 12.525, 12.257, 14.133, 11.788, 11.052, 6.966, 5.425, 2.210, 5.894, 4.555, 2.076, -4.823, -7.770, -2.947, 7.100, 7.502, 7.904, 9.645, 10.985, 11.521, 13.798]\n\n     - We can use these 24 hours as the base pattern and repeat them for the next 4 days? But that would be a seasonal naive forecast.\n\n 11. However, we see that the data has a trend? Let's check the last few days:\n\n     2017-08-13: starts at 12.793 and ends at 11.253\n     2017-08-14: starts at 13.128 and ends at 9.913\n     2017-08-15: starts at 12.123 and ends at 14.200\n     2017-08-16: starts at 13.932 and ends at 13.798\n\n     The pattern is not exactly repeating. Also, the values on 2017-08-15 and 2017-08-16 are generally higher than the previous days.\n\n 12. We might adjust by taking the average of the last two days? But without a clear trend, we can use the last available day and adjust by the average change from the previous day?\n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set, we will use a simple method: \n     - We'll take the last 24 hours and then adjust by the average change between the last two days? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the level and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 15. We decide to use a seasonal naive method for the next 96 hours by repeating the last 24 hours 4 times. \n     But we note that the level of the series might be changing. We can adjust the level by the average of the last day and the day before? \n\n 16. Let's compute the average of the last day (2017-08-16) and the day before (2017-08-15):\n\n     Day 2017-08-15: 24 hours from 00:00 to 23:00 -> average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n     Day 2017-08-16: similarly.\n\n     We don't have the exact average, but we can compute:\n\n        Day 15: \n          12.123, 11.119, 11.588, 10.181, 11.253, 9.377, 10.382, 8.573, 5.827, 1.340, -3.617, -10.717, -8.439, -5.492, -13.195, -4.823, -3.416, 2.679, 6.296, 8.105, 11.253, 11.119, 11.922, 14.200\n\n        Sum = 12.123+11.119+11.588+10.181+11.253+9.377+10.382+8.573+5.827+1.340-3.617-10.717-8.439-5.492-13.195-4.823-3.416+2.679+6.296+8.105+11.253+11.119+11.922+14.200\n\n        Let me compute step by step:\n\n        Positive: 12.123+11.119+11.588+10.181+11.253+9.377+10.382+8.573+5.827+1.340+2.679+6.296+8.105+11.253+11.119+11.922+14.200 = \n        Group: \n          12.123+11.119 = 23.242\n          +11.588 = 34.83\n          +10.181 = 45.011\n          +11.253 = 56.264\n          +9.377 = 65.641\n          +10.382 = 76.023\n          +8.573 = 84.596\n          +5.827 = 90.423\n          +1.340 = 91.763\n          +2.679 = 94.442\n          +6.296 = 100.738\n          +8.105 = 108.843\n          +11.253 = 120.096\n          +11.119 = 131.215\n          +11.922 = 143.137\n          +14.200 = 157.337\n\n        Negative: -3.617-10.717-8.439-5.492-13.195-4.823-3.416 = \n          - (3.617+10.717+8.439+5.492+13.195+4.823+3.416) = - (3.617+10.717=14.334; +8.439=22.773; +5.492=28.265; +13.195=41.46; +4.823=46.283; +3.416=49.699) = -49.699\n\n        Total = 157.337 - 49.699 = 107.638\n        Average for day 15 = 107.638 / 24 = 4.4849\n\n        Day 16:\n          [13.932, 13.664, 13.329, 12.525, 12.257, 14.133, 11.788, 11.052, 6.966, 5.425, 2.210, 5.894, 4.555, 2.076, -4.823, -7.770, -2.947, 7.100, 7.502, 7.904, 9.645, 10.985, 11.521, 13.798]\n\n        Sum = 13.932+13.664+13.329+12.525+12.257+14.133+11.788+11.052+6.966+5.425+2.210+5.894+4.555+2.076-4.823-7.770-2.947+7.100+7.502+7.904+9.645+10.985+11.521+13.798\n\n        Positive: 13.932+13.664+13.329+12.525+12.257+14.133+11.788+11.052+6.966+5.425+2.210+5.894+4.555+2.076+7.100+7.502+7.904+9.645+10.985+11.521+13.798 = \n          Let's add step by step:\n          13.932+13.664 = 27.596\n          +13.329 = 40.925\n          +12.525 = 53.45\n          +12.257 = 65.707\n          +14.133 = 79.84\n          +11.788 = 91.628\n          +11.052 = 102.68\n          +6.966 = 109.646\n          +5.425 = 115.071\n          +2.210 = 117.281\n          +5.894 = 123.175\n          +4.555 = 127.73\n          +2.076 = 129.806\n          +7.100 = 136.906\n          +7.502 = 144.408\n          +7.904 = 152.312\n          +9.645 = 161.957\n          +10.985 = 172.942\n          +11.521 = 184.463\n          +13.798 = 198.261\n\n        Negative: -4.823-7.770-2.947 = -15.54\n\n        Total = 198.261 - 15.54 = 182.721\n        Average for day 16 = 182.721 / 24 = 7.613375\n\n        The average increased from 4.4849 to 7.613375 -> an increase of about 3.128.\n\n     If we assume the level increases by about 3.128 per day, then for the next 4 days we might add 3.128, 6.256, 9.384, 12.512? \n     But that linear increase might be too aggressive and we only have two days. \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the difference in the average of the last two days? \n\n     Let the last day (day16) pattern: P = [13.932, 13.664, ... , 13.798] (24 values)\n\n     We can use P for the first next day (2017-08-17) without adjustment? \n     Then for the next day (2017-08-18), we add the difference (7.613375 - 4.4849) = 3.128 to each value of P?\n     And for the next two days, we add 2*3.128 and 3*3.128? \n\n     But note: the average of day15 was 4.4849 and day16 was 7.613375, so the jump was 3.128. \n     If we assume the same jump for the next days, then:\n\n        Day17: P (the same as day16) -> average 7.613375\n        Day18: P + 3.128 -> average 10.741375\n        Day19: P + 6.256 -> average 13.869375\n        Day20: P + 9.384 -> average 16.997375\n\n 18.

Given the inconsistency, we might use the average of the last two days to forecast the next four days? \n\n     We can use the last day (day16) as the base and then assume the level remains the same? \n\n     So we repeat the pattern of day16 for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. We decide to use the seasonal naive method: \n        Forecast for 2017-08-17 00:00:00 = value of 2017-08-16 00:00:00 = 13.932\n        ... until 2017-08-17 23:00:00 = 13.798\n\n        Then 2017-08-18 00:00:00 = 13.932, and so on.\n\n 21. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not given any in the history, but we are to forecast without missing? \n     So we will output 96 numbers without any missing.\n\n 22. We output the last 24 hours repeated 4 times.\n\n 23. However, we see that the data has a downward trend in the last few hours of day16? But we are repeating the entire day.\n\n 24.

(repeat the same 24 values for the next days)\n        2017-08-20 23:00:00,13.798\n\n 30. But note: the last value of the input was 2017-08-16 23:00:00: 13.798, and we start the forecast at 2017-08-17 00:00:00.\n\n 31. We write the next 96 hours.\n\n 32. However, we must be cautious: the problem says \"High UseFul Load\", and we are repeating the same pattern. \n     This is a simple and common baseline for seasonal data.\n\n 33. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 34. Since we are to provide the complete data, we write 96 lines.\n\n 35. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-17 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-08-20 23:00:00\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 36. We repeat the 24 values of 2017-08-16 for these 4 days.\n\n 37. We write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,HUFL\n        2017-08-17 00:00:00,13.932\n        2017-08-17 01:00:00,13.664\n        ... \n        2017-08-20 23:00:00,13.798\n        </answer>\n\n 38. But note: the input had a space after the comma? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2017-08-13 00:00:00  12.793\"\n\n     But we are to output in the same format? The example input had a space? Actually, the example input was:\n\n        \"2017-08-13 00:00:00  12.793\"\n\n     But in the problem statement, it was printed with a tab? However, the problem says: \"give me the complete data\", and the example output we are to mimic is:\n\n        \"2017-08-13 00:00:00  12.793\"\n\n     But in the data above, it was printed with multiple spaces? Actually, it's aligned. We can use a comma or a space? \n\n     The problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", and the example input had:\n\n        date    HUFL\n\n     So we have two columns: date and HUFL, separated by space? But in the example data points, it's a space and then the number.\n\n     However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\", and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\n\n     And the example in the format was:\n\n        \"2017-08-13 00:00:00  12.793\"\n\n     So we output with a space.\n\n 39. We change the separator to a space to match the input.\n\n 40. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-08-17 00:00:00 13.932\n        2017-08-17 01:00:00 13.664\n        ... \n\n 41. We note that the numbers are given with three decimal places in the input? We keep the same precision.\n\n 42. The last day (2017-08-16) values are:\n\n        00:00:00  13.932\n        01:00:00  13.664\n        02:00:00  13.329\n        03:00:00  12.525\n        04:00:00  12.257\n        05:00:00  14.133\n        06:00:00  11.788\n        07:00:00  11.052\n        08:00:00  6.966\n        09:00:00  5.425\n        10:00:00  2.210\n        11:00:00  5.894\n        12:00:00  4.555\n        13:00:00  2.076\n        14:00:00  -4.823\n        15:00:00  -7.770\n        16:00:00  -2.947\n        17:00:00  7.100\n        18:00:00  7.502\n        19:00:00  7.904\n        20:00:00  9.645\n        21:00:00  10.985\n        22:00:00  11.521\n        23:00:00  13.798\n\n 43. We repeat these 24 values for the next 4 days.\n\n 44. We write the dates accordingly.\n\n 45. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-17 23:00:00 -> the 24 values above.\n        Day2: 2017-08-18 00:00:00 to 2017-08-18 23:00:00 -> same 24 values.\n        Day3: 2017-08-19 00:00:00 to 2017-08-19 23:00:00 -> same.\n        Day4: 2017-08-20 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00 -> same.\n\n 46. We output the data.\n\n 47. However, we note that the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we output all 96 lines.\n\n 48. We write the answer.\n",
