        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (as per the given data).\n 3. We must choose an appropriate time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (4 days) and the requirement for 96 steps ahead, we can consider:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) if seasonality is present. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture weekly seasonality.\n    - ARIMA or SARIMA: We can try to fit an ARIMA model. Since we have hourly data, we might expect daily seasonality (24 hours). But with only 4 days, we have only 4 seasonal periods, which is minimal for seasonal models.\n    - Given the constraints, we might use a non-seasonal ARIMA and rely on the autocorrelation within the series.\n\n 4. However, looking at the data, there seems to be a daily pattern (diurnal cycle). For example, the load tends to be higher during certain hours and lower during others.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we can try to model the daily seasonality by using a seasonal period of 24. But note: we only have 4 days, so we must be cautious.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual, then forecast each component? But with only 4 days, decomposition might be unstable.\n\n 7. Another idea: use a rolling window of the same hour from previous days to forecast. For example, for the same hour on the next day, we can take the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we are forecasting 4 days ahead, so we don't have the same hour for the next days? Actually, we are starting from 2016-10-13 00:00:00.\n\n 8. Since we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can use the following naive seasonal approach:\n    - For the first 24 hours (day 5: 2016-10-13), we can use the values from day 1 (2016-10-09) as a base, but adjusted by the average change from day to day? \n    - However, without a clear trend, we might just use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n 9. But note: the data shows a pattern that might be changing. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? That would be 4 identical days. However, we don't have any trend or level adjustment.\n\n10. Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality and a trend. Given the short data, we can try:\n\n    Model: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1,24) - but with only 4 days, the seasonal part might be overfitted.\n\n11. Considering the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, a simpler method might be more robust.\n\n12. We can use the following method:\n    - Calculate the hourly average for the 24 hours over the 4 days.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days, we use the same hourly averages.\n\n    However, this ignores any trend. We can also adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n    Let's check the overall level of each day:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-10-09): mean = (10.516+11.052+...+9.511)/24 -> we can compute quickly.\n\n    But note: the data might have a slight decreasing trend? Let's see:\n\n    We can compute the daily means:\n\n    Day 1: 2016-10-09: \n        values: [10.516, 11.052, 8.306, 10.784, 9.98, 11.855, 13.597, 11.922, 11.253, 7.971, 8.105, 8.105, 5.291, 6.832, 6.095, 6.229, 5.626, 6.564, 5.827, 6.095, 5.492, 4.89, 7.1, 9.511]\n        mean = 8.19 (approx)\n\n    Day 2: 2016-10-10: \n        [11.922, 12.793, 11.119, 12.458, 12.458, 12.123, 13.329, 13.195, 8.975, 6.832, 8.439, 8.239, 6.229, 6.229, 6.497, 6.631, 6.363, 7.368, 6.698, 6.296, 5.626, 6.363, 8.172, 10.449]\n        mean = 8.88 (approx)\n\n    Day 3: 2016-10-11:\n        [11.855, 12.391, 12.86, 12.592, 12.19, 11.32, 12.927, 12.86, 11.454, 7.1, 6.966, 7.435, 5.358, 7.167, 5.358, 6.363, 5.894, 7.368, 6.631, 6.229, 5.626, 5.09, 4.488, 7.636]\n        mean = 8.33 (approx)\n\n    Day 4: 2016-10-12:\n        [9.377, 9.578, 9.645, 9.779, 9.98, 9.779, 10.315, 11.052, 6.832, 6.095, 7.1, 7.636, 5.492, 6.229, 6.631, 6.43, 5.358, 6.095, 5.76, 6.028, 5.626, 4.957, 6.966, 8.841]\n        mean = 7.58 (approx)\n\n    The daily means: [8.19, 8.88, 8.33, 7.58] -> there is a drop on the last day.\n\n    We might adjust the forecast by the trend of the daily means? \n\n    However, we are forecasting 4 days ahead. We can fit a linear trend to the daily means and project? But 4 points are too few.\n\n13. Given the above, we decide to use:\n\n    - Step 1: Compute the hourly profile (average for each hour of the day) over the 4 days.\n    - Step 2: Compute the daily means for the 4 days and then compute the average daily mean for the next 4 days by taking the last daily mean (or a moving average). But the last day was 7.58, and the previous days were higher. We might assume the next 4 days will have a daily mean around the average of the last 2 days? or the last day? \n\n    Since we don't have a clear trend and the data is short, we can use the overall mean of the entire 96 points as the base level and then adjust the hourly profile to that level? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day's mean as the base for the next day? and then for the subsequent days, we can apply a small adjustment? \n\n    However, without more data, it's hard to predict the trend. We'll assume that the level of the average of the entire history.\n\n    Let:\n        overall_mean = mean of all 96 points.\n\n    Then, we compute the hourly profile (average for each hour) over the 4 days. Let the hourly profile for hour h be: H_h.\n\n    Then, the overall mean of the hourly profile (i.e., the mean of H_h for h in 0..23) should be the same as the overall mean of the data? \n\n    Actually, the overall mean is the same as the average of the daily means? \n\n    We can then adjust the hourly profile to the overall mean? \n\n    But note: the hourly profile already is computed from the data that has the overall mean.\n\n    So we can simply use the hourly profile for each hour of the next 4 days? \n\n    However, if we do that, the daily mean of the forecast will be the same as the overall mean of the past 4 days. But the last day was below that. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last value of the level and then adjust the profile? \n\n    Given the uncertainty, we choose to use the hourly profile without any level adjustment. \n\n    Why? Because the drop on the last day might be an anomaly? or the beginning of a downward trend? We don't have enough data to tell.\n\n    The problem says: \"must\" provide the complete data. So we have to make a choice.\n\n    We'll use the simple method: the average for each hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): average of [10.516, 11.922, 11.855, 9.377] = (10.516+11.922+11.855+9.377)/4 = 10.9175\n        For hour 1 (01:00): average of [11.052, 12.793, 12.391, 9.578] = (11.052+12.793+12.391+9.578)/4 = 11.4535\n        ... and so on for each hour.\n\n    Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day 5 (2016-10-13): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day 6 (2016-10-14): same as day5\n        Day 7 (2016-10-15): same as day5\n        Day 8 (2016-10-16): same as day5\n\n    But note: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n    The last date in the input is 2016-10-12 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        2016-10-13 00:00:00\n        2016-10-13 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-13 23:00:00\n        2016-10-14 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-16 23:00:00\n\n    So we have 4 days: 2016-10-13, 14, 15, 16.\n\n    We'll compute the 24 hourly averages from the 4 days of history.\n\n    However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have a week of data. So we ignore.\n\n14. Implementation:\n\n    We'll group the data by hour of the day (ignoring the day) and compute the mean.\n\n    The data:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-09: 24 hours\n        Day2: 2016-10-10: 24 hours\n        Day3: 2016-10-11: 24 hours\n        Day4: 2016-10-12: 24 hours\n\n    We have 4 values for each hour (0 to 23). We compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00): \n        values: [10.516, 11.922, 11.855, 9.377] -> mean = (10.516+11.922+11.855+9.377)/4 = 10.9175\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n    Then, the forecast for the next 4 days is the same 24 numbers repeated 4 times.\n\n15. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we don't need to impute for the history.\n\n16. We'll generate the forecast:\n\n    Dates: starting from 2016-10-13 00:00:00, then 2016-10-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n\n    Values: \n        Day1 (2016-10-13): [h0, h1, h2, ..., h23]  (the 24 averages)\n        Day2 (2016-10-14): [h0, h1, h2, ..., h23]\n        Day3 (2016-10-15): [h0, h1, h2, ..., h23]\n        Day4 (2016-10-16): [h0, h1, h2, ..., h23]\n\n17. We compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We'll write a small code in mind:\n\n    hour0: [10.516, 11.922, 11.855, 9.377] -> 10.9175\n    hour1: [11.052, 12.793, 12.391, 9.578] -> 11.4535\n    hour2: [8.306, 11.119, 12.860, 9.645] -> (8.306+11.119+12.860+9.645)/4 = 10.4825\n    hour3: [10.784, 12.458, 12.592, 9.779] -> (10.784+12.458+12.592+9.779)/4 = 11.40325\n    hour4: [9.980, 12.458, 12.190, 9.980] -> (9.980+12.458+12.190+9.980)/4 = 11.152\n    hour5: [11.855, 12.123, 11.320, 9.779] -> (11.855+12.123+11.320+9.779)/4 = 11.26925\n    hour6: [13.597, 13.329, 12.927, 10.315] -> (13.597+13.329+12.927+10.315)/4 = 12.542\n    hour7: [11.922, 13.195, 12.860, 11.052] -> (11.922+13.195+12.860+11.052)/4 = 12.25725\n    hour8: [11.253, 8.975, 11.454, 6.832] -> (11.253+8.975+11.454+6.832)/4 = 9.6285\n    hour9: [7.971, 6.832, 7.100, 6.095] -> (7.971+6.832+7.100+6.095)/4 = 7.000\n    hour10: [8.105, 8.439, 6.966, 7.100] -> (8.105+8.439+6.966+7.100)/4 = 7.6525\n    hour11: [8.105, 8.239, 7.435, 7.636] -> (8.105+8.239+7.435+7.636)/4 = 7.85375\n    hour12: [5.291, 6.229, 5.358, 5.492] -> (5.291+6.229+5.358+5.492)/4 = 5.5925\n    hour13: [6.832, 6.229, 7.167, 6.229] -> (6.832+6.229+7.167+6.229)/4 = 6.61425\n    hour14: [6.095, 6.497, 5.358, 6.631] -> (6.095+6.497+5.358+6.631)/4 = 6.14525\n    hour15: [6.229, 6.631, 6.363, 6.430] -> (6.229+6.631+6.363+6.430)/4 = 6.41325\n    hour16: [5.626, 6.363, 5.894, 5.358] -> (5.626+6.363+5.894+5.358)/4 = 5.81025\n    hour17: [6.564, 7.368, 7.368, 6.095] -> (6.564+7.368+7.368+6.095)/4 = 6.84875\n    hour18: [5.827, 6.698, 6.631, 5.760] -> (5.827+6.698+6.631+5.760)/4 = 6.229\n    hour19: [6.095, 6.296, 6.229, 6.028] -> (6.095+6.296+6.229+6.028)/4 = 6.162\n    hour20: [5.492, 5.626, 5.626, 5.626] -> (5.492+5.626+5.626+5.626)/4 = 5.5925\n    hour21: [4.890, 6.363, 5.090, 4.957] -> (4.890+6.363+5.090+4.957)/4 = 5.325\n    hour22: [7.100, 8.172, 4.488, 6.966] -> (7.100+8.172+4.488+6.966)/4 = 6.6815\n    hour23: [9.511, 10.449, 7.636, 8.841] -> (9.511+10.449+7.636+8.841)/4 = 9.10925\n\n    Now, the forecast for the next 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-13: \n            00:00: 10.9175\n            01:00: 11.4535\n            02:00: 10.4825\n            03:00: 11.40325\n            04:00: 11.152\n            05:00: 11.26925\n            06:00: 12.542\n            07:00: 12.25725\n            08:00: 9.6285\n            09:00: 7.000\n            10:00: 7.6525\n            11:00: 7.85375\n            12:00: 5.5925\n            13:00: 6.61425\n            14:00: 6.14525\n            15:00: 6.41325\n            16:00: 5.81025\n            17:00: 6.84875\n            18:00: 6.229\n            19:00: 6.162\n            20:00: 5.5925\n            21:00: 5.325\n            22:00: 6.6815\n            23:00: 9.10925\n\n        Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n18. Format the answer:\n\n    We must output 96 lines, each with the date and the forecast value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n    Example:\n\n        2016-10-13 00:00:00 10.917\n        2016-10-13 01:00:00 11.453\n        ...\n\n    We'll round the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Let's round:\n\n        hour0: 10.9175 -> 10.918 (but we'll use 3 decimal, so round to 3 decimals: 10.918? but the input had 3 decimals)\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Actually, the input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        We can use: round(x, 3)\n\n    But note: the rounding might be to the nearest thousandth.\n\n    Example: 10.9175 -> 10.918 (if we round half up)\n\n    We'll do that.\n\n    However, note that the problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\".\n\n    We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n19. Code for the 24 hours (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n    h0: 10.9175 -> 10.918\n    h1: 11.4535 -> 11.454\n    h2: 10.4825 -> 10.483\n    h3: 11.40325 -> 11.403\n    h4: 11.152 -> 11.152\n    h5: 11.26925 -> 11.269\n    h6: 12.542 -> 12.542\n    h7: 12.25725 -> 12.257\n    h8: 9.6285 -> 9.629\n    h9: 7.000 -> 7.000\n    h10: 7.6525 -> 7.653\n    h11: 7.85375 -> 7.854\n    h12: 5.5925 -> 5.593\n    h13: 6.61425 -> 6.614\n    h14: 6.14525 -> 6.145\n    h15: 6.41325 -> 6.413\n    h16: 5.81025 -> 5.810\n    h17: 6.84875 -> 6.849\n    h18: 6.229 -> 6.229\n    h19: 6.162 -> 6.162\n    h20: 5.5925 -> 5.593\n    h21: 5.325 -> 5.325\n    h22: 6.6815 -> 6.682\n    h23: 9.10925 -> 9.109\n\n    But note: the input had 5.291, 6.832, etc. So we'll output with 3 decimals.\n\n    However, let's check the rounding:\n\n        h0: 10.9175 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> round up: 10.918\n\n    We'll do that for all.\n\n    But note: the problem does not to omit any content, so we must output 96 lines.\n\n20. Generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2016-10-13 00:00:00\n    End: 2016-10-16 23:00:00\n\n    We can generate by:\n\n        base = datetime(2016,10,13,0,0,0)\n        then add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n    We'll write:\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = base + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)   # but actually, we can do: base + timedelta(hours= i) for i in 0..95\n\n    Actually, we can do:\n\n        start_date = \"2016-10-13 00:00:00\"\n        then for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + i * timedelta(hours=1)\n\n    But we are writing manually? We can generate the dates:\n\n        2016-10-13 00:00:00\n        2016-10-13 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-13 23:00:00\n        2016-10-14 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-16 23:00:00\n\n21. Now, the values:\n\n        We have a list of 24 values (the hourly averages for the 24 hours) and we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n    So:\n\n        values = [10.918, 11.454, 9.109]   # but we have 24 values\n\n    Then the full forecast: values * 4\n\n22. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n    Note: The problem says the answer must be in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date1] [value1]\n        [date2] [value2]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n    We'll output 96 lines.\n\n23. Let's write the 24 values (rounded) for the 24 hours:\n\n    h0: 10.9175 -> 10.918\n    h1: 11.4535 -> 11.454\n    h2: 10.4825 -> 10.483\n    h3: 11.40325 -> 11.403\n    h4: 11.152 -> 11.152\n    h5: 11.26925 -> 11.269\n    h6: 12.542 -> 12.542\n    (but 12.542 is already 3 decimals? yes, but we rounded above to 12.542 -> same)\n\n    Actually, we'll recalc the rounding for each:\n\n        h0: round(10.9175, 3) = 10.918\n        h1: round(11.4535, 3) = 11.454\n        h2: round(10.4825, 3) = 10.483\n        h3: round(11.40325, 3) = 11.403   (because 0.00025 is less than 0.0005? but 11.40325: the 4th decimal is 2, so we don't round up -> 11.403)\n        Actually, 11.40325: \n            thousandths place is 3, the next digit is 2 -> so we leave it as 11.403.\n\n        But let me do it properly: \n            We are rounding to 3 decimal places: look at the 4th decimal.\n            If 4th decimal is 5 or above, we round up the 3rd decimal by one.\n\n        h3: 11.40325 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> so 11.403\n        h4: 11.152 -> 11.152\n        h5: 11.26925 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> 11.269\n        h6: 12.542 -> 12.542\n        h7: 12.25725 -> 12.257\n        h8: 9.6285 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 9.629\n        h9: 7.000 -> 7.000\n        h10: 7.6525 -> 7.653 (because 5, so 7.6525 -> 7.653)\n        h11: 7.85375 -> 7.854 (because 7, so round up: 7.854)\n        h12: 5.5925 -> 5.593\n        h13: 6.61425 -> 6.614\n        h14: 6.14525 -> 6.145\n        h15: 6.41325 -> 6.413\n        h16: 5.81025 -> 5.810\n        h17: 6.84875 -> 6.849\n        h18: 6.229 -> 6.229\n        h19: 6.162 -> 6.162\n        h20: 5.5925 -> 5.593\n        h21: 5.325 -> 5.325\n        h22: 6.6815 -> 6.682\n        h23: 9.10925 -> 9.109\n\n    So the list of 24 values:\n\n        [10.918, 11.454, 10.483, 11.403, 11.152, 11.269, 12.542, 12.257, 9.629, 7.000, 7.653, 7.854, 5.593, 6.614, 6.145, 6.413, 5.810, 6.849, 6.229, 6.162, 5.593, 5.325, 6.682, 9.109]\n\n    Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n24. Now, generate the dates:\n\n    We have:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-13\n        Day2: 2016-10-14\n        Day3: 2016-10-15\n        Day4: 2016-10-16\n\n    For each day, 24 hours: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n    We'll write:\n\n        2016-10-13 00:00:00 10.918\n        2016-10-13 01:00:00 11.454\n        ... \n        2016-10-13 23:00:00 9.109\n        2016-10-14 00:00:00 10.918\n        ...\n        2016-10-16 23:00:00 9.109\n\n25.
