        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to predict 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points as a complete series.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 time steps, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps ahead. Given the complexity and the need for accuracy, we might consider:\n   - SARIMA: to capture seasonality and trends. However, with only 96 points, it might be challenging to fit a complex seasonal model. The data shows daily patterns (24 hours) so we can set seasonality to 24.\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n   - Alternatively, a machine learning model (like LSTM) but that requires more data and might be overkill.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. For forecasting, we assume the given data is complete.\n\n Given the constraints, we choose a model that can be fitted quickly and provide 96 steps forecast.\n\n Let's analyze the data:\n   - There is a clear daily pattern: during the day (especially around 9:00 to 10:00) the load drops to low values (even negative) and then rises in the evening.\n   - The data has a strong seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, but a simpler approach is to use the Seasonal ARIMA model.\n\n Steps for SARIMA:\n   - We will use auto_arima to find the best parameters, but note we have limited data (only 4 days). Alternatively, we can use a simple model: (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24)\n\n However, we are not allowed to run code, so we have to simulate the process.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: \n   - Since the data is short, we can use a naive seasonal method: the forecast for the next 96 hours is the last observed 96 hours? But that would be the same as the first 96 hours? Not exactly.\n\n But note: the data is from 4 consecutive days. We can try to capture the daily pattern and the trend over the 4 days.\n\n However, the problem requires 96 points and we must output the complete data.\n\n Given the complexity and without running actual code, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? But that would be 24-hour cycle repeated 4 times? \n\n But note: the data shows a slight trend? Let's look at the values at 00:00:\n   2017-01-21 00:00:00 -> 12.726\n   2017-01-22 00:00:00 -> 12.190\n   2017-01-23 00:00:00 -> 10.851\n   2017-01-24 00:00:00 -> 9.310\n\n There is a downward trend. Similarly, at 12:00:\n   2017-01-21 12:00:00 -> -3.483\n   2017-01-22 12:00:00 -> -2.545\n   2017-01-23 12:00:00 -> -4.957\n   2017-01-24 12:00:00 -> -3.885\n\n It's not consistent. \n\n Given the challenge, we must produce a forecast. We'll use a simple method: \n   - We will take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days and then adjust by a linear trend.\n\n But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) into the future. We can break the forecast into two parts:\n   - The daily pattern (seasonal component) and a trend.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual using moving averages (with window=24) for the trend, then average the seasonal indices for each hour, and then model the trend with a linear regression.\n\n However, without running code, we can approximate:\n\n   - The trend: we can fit a linear trend to the entire series. Let time t=0 at the first point and t=95 at the last.\n   - The equation: trend = a + b*t.\n\n   But note: the trend might not be linear and we have only 96 points.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (24 points) to see the trend? \n\n But the problem requires a forecast. We must output 96 numbers.\n\n Since we are constrained, we will use a naive method: \n   - We will use the last day (24 hours) and adjust by the average change from day to day? \n\n However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n We decide to use a simple average of the four days for each hour of the day to form the seasonal pattern, and then project the trend continues linearly? \n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Extract the seasonal indices: for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values. We have 4 days. We average them.\n\n  2. The trend: we take the average of each day (by averaging the 24 hours of that day) and then fit a linear trend to the 4 daily averages.\n\n     Day1: average of 2017-01-21\n     Day2: average of 2017-01-22\n     Day3: average of 2017-01-23\n     Day4: average of 2017-01-24\n\n     Then we have:\n        Day1: t0 -> average1\n        Day2: t1 -> average2\n        Day3: t2 -> average3\n        Day4: t3 -> average4\n\n     We fit a line: avg = a + b * day_index\n\n  3. For the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) we compute the daily average using the linear trend.\n\n  4. Then for each hour in a day, we set the forecast for that hour to be: \n        forecast = (seasonal_index for that hour) * (daily_avg for the day) / (overall_seasonal_avg)\n\n     But note: we are not computed an overall seasonal average? Alternatively, we can use additive model.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do additive decomposition:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the trend by a moving average of 24 hours (centered) to get the trend component T_t.\n     Step 2: Detrend the series: Y_t - T_t = S_t + R_t.\n     Step 3: Compute the seasonal indices by averaging the detrended values for each hour (0-23) over the 4 days.\n     Step 4: The seasonal indices should sum to zero? We can adjust by making the average of the indices for one cycle (24) to zero.\n\n     Then the model is: Y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t.\n\n     For forecasting:\n        - We need to forecast the trend T_t for the next 96 hours. We can fit a linear model to the trend component (which we have for 96 points) and project.\n        - Then add the seasonal index for the corresponding hour.\n\n     But note: the trend component we have is for the first 96 hours. We need to extend the trend.\n\n  However, without running code, we have to do it manually? That is not feasible.\n\n Given the constraints, we will use a simpler additive model:\n\n   Let S_h be the seasonal index for hour h (h=0 to 23) computed as the average of the (observed value at hour h minus the daily average) for each day.\n\n   Steps for the historical data:\n      For each day d (d=0 to 3):\n          avg_d = average of the 24 hours in day d.\n      For each hour h in day d:\n          S_h = (1/4) * sum_{d} (Y_{d,h} - avg_d)\n\n   Then the model for a given day d and hour h is: \n        Y_{d,h} = avg_d + S_h + noise\n\n   For forecasting, we need the daily average for the next 4 days. We have 4 daily averages: [avg0, avg1, avg2, avg3]. We fit a linear regression:\n\n        day_index: [0,1,2,3] -> [avg0, avg1, avg2, avg3]\n\n        Let the line be: avg(d) = a + b*d\n\n        Then for day4 (d=4): avg4 = a + b*4\n        day5: d=5 -> avg5 = a+b*5\n        day6: d=6 -> avg6 = a+b*6\n        day7: d=7 -> avg7 = a+b*7\n\n   Then the forecast for hour h in day4 (which is the first forecast day, i.e., 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 23:00:00) is:\n        F_{4,h} = avg4 + S_h\n\n   Similarly for the next days.\n\n  But note: the first day in the data is 2017-01-21 (day0), then 2017-01-22 (day1), 2017-01-24 (day3). The next day is 2017-01-25 (day4), then 2017-01-26 (day5), 2017-01-27 (day6), 2017-01-28 (day7).\n\n  We have to generate 96 hours: 4 days.\n\n  Steps in summary:\n\n   1. Compute the daily averages for the 4 days we have.\n   2. Compute the seasonal indices S_h for h in 0..23 by averaging the deviations (Y_{d,h} - avg_d) over the 4 days.\n   3. Fit a linear model to the daily averages: \n          x = [0,1,2,3] (days)\n          y = [avg0, avg1, avg2, avg3]\n\n        We can compute:\n          b = (n*sum(xy) - sum(x)*sum(y)) / (n*sum(x^2) - (sum(x))^2)\n          a = (sum(y) - b*sum(x)) / n\n\n        n=4, sum(x)=0+1+2+3=6, sum(y)=avg0+avg1+avg2+avg3, \n        sum(x^2)=0+1+4+9=14\n        sum(xy)= 0*avg0 + 1*avg1 + 2*avg2 + 3*avg3\n\n   4. Then for the next day d=4,5,6,7:\n        avg_d = a + b*d\n\n   5. Then for each hour h in [0,23] for day d in [4,5,6,7]:\n        forecast = avg_d + S_h\n\n  But note: we must generate the dates. The last date in the given data is 2017-01-24 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-01-25 00:00:00.\n\n  We'll generate 96 hours starting from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the data might have non-linear trends? But with 4 points, linear is the best we can do.\n\n  Let's compute the daily averages for the given data:\n\n    Day0 (2017-01-21): \n        avg0 = (12.726+12.793+11.052+11.119+11.855+11.989+11.387+13.597+15.606+4.153+0+0.134-3.483-3.617-1.875+0.603+4.689+10.248+11.922+14.401+15.338+16.745+15.472+14.401) / 24\n\n    We can calculate:\n\n        Let me compute step by step:\n\n        First 9: 12.726+12.793+11.052+11.119+11.855+11.989+11.387+13.597+15.606 = 111.124\n        Then: 4.153+0+0.134 = 4.287\n        Then: -3.483-3.617-1.875+0.603+4.689+10.248+11.922+14.401+15.338+16.745+15.472+14.401 = \n            negatives: -3.483-3.617-1.875 = -8.975\n            positives: 0.603+4.689+10.248+11.922+14.401+15.338+16.745+15.472+14.401 = 103.819\n            so 103.819 -
