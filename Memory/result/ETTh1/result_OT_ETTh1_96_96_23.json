        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00) for Oil Temperature (OT).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) into the future.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data, we can use:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Exponential Smoothing\n    - Prophet by Facebook\n    - LSTM (if we were to use deep learning, but that might be overkill and we don't have a lot of data)\n\n 4. Considering the data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we need a method that can handle multiple seasonality.\n    However, note that we only have 4 days of data, so it's hard to capture weekly or monthly seasonality. But we can see daily pattern.\n\n 5. Let's observe the data: \n    - The temperature seems to have a daily cycle (lower at night, higher during the day?).\n    - But note: the first day (2016-10-01) starts at around 18.78 and goes up to 20.89 at 23:00, then the next day starts at 20.47 and so on.\n\n 6. We can try to use a model that captures seasonality. Since we have hourly data and expect daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 7. Given the small data size, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with a seasonal period of 24.\n\n 8. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We need to check stationarity and difference if necessary.\n    - We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters, but we are limited by the data size.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing) with seasonality, which is designed for this.\n\n 10. Given the data length (96 points) and the forecast horizon (96 points), we must be cautious because forecasting 96 points from 96 points is a long horizon.\n\n 11. We'll use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt) because it can handle seasonality and is robust for short series.\n\n 12. However, note: the data might have a trend? Let's see:\n        The first day: min ~13.788 (at 09:00) and max ~21.034 (at 14:00)\n        The second day: min ~16.039 (at 17:00) and max ~21.525 (at 14:00)\n        The third day: min ~19.768 (at 07:00) and max ~26.028 (at 17:00) -> note the increasing trend?\n        The fourth day: min ~20.330 (at 06:00) and max ~24.691 (at 21:00)\n\n     There might be an upward trend? But also note the third day is higher and then the fourth day is a bit lower? Not a clear trend.\n\n 13. We'll use the Holt-Winters method with additive seasonality (since the seasonality amplitude seems constant) and damped trend.\n\n 14. Implementation in Python (if we were to code) would use statsmodels' ExponentialSmoothing.\n\n 15. However, since we are to provide the answer in this format, we will simulate the process and generate the forecast.\n\n 16. But note: we are in a text-based environment. We cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a precomputed forecast or a reasonable estimation.\n\n 17. Given the constraints, we can generate a forecast by:\n      a) Extracting the daily pattern (by averaging the same hour across the 4 days) and then adjusting by the overall level and trend.\n\n 18. Steps for manual forecast:\n      - Calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n      - But note: there is a trend? We see an overall increase? Let's compute the daily average:\n          Day1: average of 24 points -> (18.783+18.572+...+20.893)/24\n          We can compute:\n\n          Day1: \n            We have 24 points: \n            [18.783, 18.572, 18.079, 19.205, 18.642, 19.275, 19.134, 19.275, 17.024, 13.788, 14.351, 15.969, 19.275, 19.979, 21.034, 20.823, 20.752, 19.556, 20.541, 20.471, 20.682, 20.752, 20.752, 20.893]\n            Average = (sum of above)/24 = 19.15 (approx)\n\n          Day2: \n            [20.471, 20.26, 20.119, 20.612, 19.768, 20.33, 19.979, 18.853, 19.838, 19.275, 19.697, 20.049, 20.119, 21.245, 21.526, 20.471, 19.064, 16.039, 19.275, 19.768, 19.908, 19.979, 19.979, 20.26]\n            Average = 19.82 (approx)\n\n          Day3:\n            [20.541, 19.838, 20.612, 20.26, 20.612, 19.979, 20.049, 19.768, 20.401, 20.682, 21.456, 22.089, 22.581, 24.481, 24.27, 24.199, 24.973, 26.028, 24.551, 23.637, 23.848, 23.215, 22.581, 22.019]\n            Average = 22.18 (approx)\n\n          Day4:\n            [22.019, 21.597, 21.385, 20.682, 20.823, 20.963, 20.33, 20.541, 20.541, 22.3, 22.792, 22.652, 23.496, 23.426, 23.637, 23.496, 23.496, 23.848, 22.511, 22.933, 23.848, 24.692, 23.918, 23.637]\n            Average = 22.50 (approx)\n\n        The daily averages: [19.15, 19.82, 22.18, 22.50] -> showing an upward trend? But note the last two days are higher.\n\n      - We can fit a linear trend to the daily averages and then project the next 4 days (from day5 to day8) and then use the hourly pattern.\n\n 19. How to get the hourly pattern?\n      - We can de-trend the data by subtracting the daily average from each day's hourly data to get the seasonal component.\n      - Then average the de-trended values for each hour (across the 4 days) to get the base pattern.\n\n 20. But note: the trend might not be linear? And we only have 4 days. We can use a linear regression for the daily averages.\n\n 21. Let:\n        Day: 1 -> average = 19.15\n        Day: 2 -> 19.82\n        Day: 3 -> 22.18\n        Day: 4 -> 22.50\n\n      We can fit a line: y = a + b*x, where x is the day number (1,2,3,4)\n\n      We get: \n          b = (n*sum(xy) - sum(x)*sum(y)) / (n*sum(x^2) - (sum(x))^2)\n          a = (sum(y) - b*sum(x)) / n\n\n      n=4, sum(x)=1+2+3+4=10, sum(y)=19.15+19.82+22.18+22.50 = 83.65\n      sum(x^2)=1+4+9+16=30\n      sum(xy)=1*19.15 + 2*19.82 + 3*22.18 + 4*22.50 = 19.15+39.64+66.54+90 = 215.33\n\n      b = (4*215.33 - 10*83.65) / (4*30 - 100) = (861.32 - 836.5) / (120-100) = 24.82/20 = 1.241\n      a = (83.65 - 1.241*10)/4 = (83.65-12.41)/4 = 71.24/4 = 17.81\n\n      So the trend line: y = 17.81 + 1.241*x\n\n      For the next 4 days (x=5,6,7,8):\n        Day5: 17.81 + 1.241*5 = 17.81+6.205 = 24.015\n        Day6: 17.81+1.241*6 = 17.81+7.446 = 25.256\n        Day7: 17.81+1.241*7 = 17.81+8.687 = 26.497\n        Day8: 17.81+1.241*8 = 17.81+9.928 = 27.738\n\n 22. Now, we compute the seasonal component (hourly pattern) by:\n        For each day, subtract the daily average from each hourly value to get the deviation.\n        Then for each hour (0 to 23), average the deviations over the 4 days.\n\n 23. Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 18.783 - 19.15 = -0.367\n        Day2: 20.471 - 19.82 = 0.651\n        Day3: 20.541 - 22.18 = -1.639\n        Day4: 22.019 - 22.50 = -0.481\n        Average = (-0.367+0.651-1.639-0.481)/4 = (-1.836)/4 = -0.459\n\n 24. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 25. Then for the forecast of day5 (x=5) at hour0: \n        base = 24.015 (the daily average for day5) \n        plus the seasonal component for hour0 (-0.459) \n        => 24.015 - 0.459 = 23.556\n\n 26. Similarly, we compute for all 96 hours.\n\n 27. However, note: the trend might be too strong? The daily average for day5 is 24.015, which is higher than the last day (22.50). \n      And the pattern: the temperature might not keep increasing at 1.24 per day? But we only have 4 days and the last two days are higher.\n\n 28. Alternatively, we can use the last day's average as a base and then add the seasonal component? But that ignores the trend.\n\n 29. Given the data, we'll proceed with the linear trend for the daily averages and the seasonal component.\n\n 30. We must be cautious: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly.\n\n 31. We'll compute the seasonal indices for each hour:\n\n      Hour0: [ -0.367, 0.651, -1.639, -0.481] -> average = (-0.367+0.651-1.639-0.481)/4 = (-1.836)/4 = -0.459\n      Hour1: \n          Day1: 18.572 - 19.15 = -0.578\n          Day2: 20.26 - 19.82 = 0.44\n          Day3: 19.838 - 22.18 = -2.342\n          Day4: 21.597 - 22.50 = -0.903\n          Average = (-0.578+0.44-2.342-0.903)/4 = (-3.383)/4 = -0.84575\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 32. This is a lot of manual calculation. Since we are in an AI response, we can simulate the calculation and provide the forecast.\n\n 33. But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We have to generate 96 data points.\n\n 34. We'll generate the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00) using the method above.\n\n 35. However, due to the complexity and the length, we will write a small program in our mind and then output the data.\n\n 36. Alternatively, we can use a different approach: \n        We note that the data has a daily pattern and a trend. We can use a moving average to remove the trend and then get the seasonal indices.\n\n 37. Given the time constraints of this response, we will provide a forecast that is based on the last day (day4) and then adjust by the trend and the seasonal pattern.\n\n 38. But to be practical, we can use the seasonal pattern from the 4 days and then project the daily average with the linear trend.\n\n 39. We'll compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0-23) as the average deviation from the daily mean over the 4 days.\n\n 40. Then for each day in the forecast (day5 to day8, which are x=5,6,7,8), we set:\n        Forecast for hour) = (17.81 + 1.241 * day_number) + seasonal_index[hour]\n\n 41. We must generate the seasonal indices for all 24 hours.\n\n 42. Let's compute the daily averages more accurately:\n\n        Day1: \n          sum = 18.783+18.572+18.079+19.205+18.642+19.275+19.134+19.275+17.024+13.788+14.351+15.969+19.275+19.979+21.034+20.823+20.752+19.556+20.541+20.471+20.682+20.752+20.752+20.893\n          = 459.6\n          average = 459.6 / 24 = 19.15\n\n        Day2:\n          sum = 20.471+20.26+20.119+20.612+19.768+20.33+19.979+18.853+19.838+19.275+19.697+20.049+20.119+21.245+21.526+20.471+19.064+16.039+19.275+19.768+19.908+19.979+19.979+20.26\n          = 475.68\n          average = 475.68 / 24 = 19.82\n\n        Day3:\n          sum = 20.541+19.838+20.612+20.26+20.612+19.979+20.049+19.768+20.401+20.682+21.456+22.089+22.581+24.481+24.27+24.199+24.973+26.028+24.551+23.637+23.848+23.215+22.581+22.019\n          = 532.3\n          average = 532.3 / 24 = 22.1791667\n\n        Day4:\n          sum = 22.019+21.597+21.385+20.682+20.823+20.963+20.33+20.541+20.541+22.3+22.792+22.652+23.496+23.426+23.637+23.496+23.496+23.848+22.511+22.933+23.848+24.692+23.918+23.637\n          = 540.0\n          average = 540.0 / 24 = 22.5\n\n 43. Now compute the deviations for each hour and then the average deviation for each hour:\n\n      Hour0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 18.783 - 19.15 = -0.367\n        Day2: 20.471 - 19.82 = 0.651\n        Day3: 20.541 - 22.1791667 = -1.6381667\n        Day4: 22.019 - 22.5 = -0.481\n        Average = (-0.367 + 0.651 -1.6381667 -0.481) / 4 = (-1.8351667)/4 = -0.458791675\n\n      Hour1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: 18.572 - 19.15 = -0.578\n        Day2: 20.26 - 19.82 = 0.44\n        Day3: 19.838 - 22.1791667 = -2.3411667\n        Day4: 21.597 - 22.5 = -0.903\n        Average = (-0.578+0.44-2.3411667-0.903)/4 = (-3.3821667)/4 = -0.845541675\n\n      Hour2 (02:00:00):\n        Day1: 18.079 - 19.15 = -1.071\n        Day2: 20.119 - 19.82 = 0.299\n        Day3: 20.612 - 22.1791667 = -1.5671667\n        Day4: 21.385 - 22.5 = -1.115\n        Average = (-1.071+0.299-1.5671667-1.115)/4 = (-3.4541667)/4 = -0.863541675\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 44. This is very time-consuming. We'll do it programmatically in our mind and then output the forecast.\n\n 45. However, we are to provide the answer now. We'll generate the first few and then the rest similarly.\n\n 46. We'll compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours and then use the formula:\n\n        Forecast(day, hour) = (17.81 + 1.241 * day) + seasonal_index[hour]\n\n      where day: for day5 -> day=5, day6->6, day7->7, day8->8.\n\n 47. But note: the day index in the linear model: day1=1, day2=2, day3=3, day4=4, so day5=5, etc.\n\n 48. We must also note that the dates: \n        Start: 2016-10-05 00:00:00 (day5, hour0)\n        Then 2016-10-05 01:00:00 (day5, hour1)\n        ... until 2016-10-08 23:00:00 (day8, hour23)\n\n 49. We'll compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23) and then for each day from 5 to 8, we add the seasonal index.\n\n 50. We'll create an array `seasonal_index` of length 24.\n\n 51. Due to the complexity of manual calculation of 24 points, we will approximate by using the average of the deviations we have.\n\n 52. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the trend? But we have a method.\n\n 53. We decide to use the computed seasonal indices as above.\n\n 54. We'll compute a few more to see the pattern:\n\n      Hour3 (03:00:00):\n        Day1: 19.205 - 19.15 = 0.055\n        Day2: 20.612 - 19.82 = 0.792\n        Day3: 20.26 - 22.1791667 = -1.9191667\n        Day4: 20.682 - 22.5 = -1.818\n        Average = (0.055+0.792-1.9191667-1.818)/4 = (-2.8901667)/4 = -0.722541675\n\n      Hour4 (04:00:00):\n        Day1: 18.642 - 19.15 = -0.508\n        Day2: 19.768 - 19.82 = -0.052\n        Day3: 20.612 - 22.1791667 = -1.5671667\n        Day4: 20.823 - 22.5 = -1.677\n        Average = (-0.508-0.052-1.5671667-1.677)/4 = (-3.8041667)/4 = -0.951041675\n\n 55. We see that the seasonal indices are negative for these hours? But note: the daily average is the base, and the hourly values are deviations.\n\n 56. We'll complete the seasonal indices for all 24 hours by doing the same.\n\n 57. Given the time, we will not write all 24 here. We'll assume we have computed them and then generate the forecast.\n\n 58. We'll generate the forecast for the first 3 hours of day5:\n\n        Hour0: (17.81 + 1.241*5) + seasonal_index[0] = 24.015 + (-0.458791675) = 23.556208325\n        Hour1: 24.015 + (-0.845541675) = 23.169458325\n        Hour2: 24.015 + (-0.863541675) = 23.151458325\n        Hour3: 24.015 + (-0.722541675) = 23.292458325\n        ...\n\n 59. We must generate 96 points. We'll do this for day5 (24 hours), day6 (24 hours), day7 (24 hours), day8 (24 hours).\n\n 60. But note: the linear trend might be too aggressive? The temperature on day8 would be around 27.7, which is higher than the highest we have (26.028 on day3). \n      But it's possible? We don't have more data to validate.\n\n 61. We'll proceed.\n\n 62. We must format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-05 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-10-05 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-10-08 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n 63. We'll generate the values using the method above.\n\n 64. However, due to the complexity and the need for 96 points, we will provide a sample of the first few and last few.\n\n 65. But the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 66. Therefore, we have to generate all 96.\n\n 67.

Then for each hour in the day, we do: base + S[hour]\n\n 72. Example for day5, hour0: 24.015 + (-0.458791675) = 23.556208325 -> we can round to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 or 6? \n      The data had up to 3 decimal places, but sometimes 6. We'll keep 3 decimal places.\n\n 73. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 74.

Similarly, for day6 (base=25.256):\n\n        hour0: 25.256 + S[0] = 25.256 -0.458791675 = 24.797\n        ... and so on.\n\n 76. We'll generate all 96 points.\n\n 77. We must be cautious: the seasonal indices are the same for the same hour of the day.\n\n 78. We'll write the full 96 lines.\n\n 79. Given the length, we will generate the first 24 (day5) and then the next 24 (day6) and so on.\n\n 80. We'll format the date accordingly:\n\n        Day5: 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-05 23:00:00\n        Day6: 2016-10-06 00:00:00 to 2016-10-06 23:00:00\n        Day7: 2016-10-07 00:00:00 to 2016-10-07 23:00:00\n        Day8: 2016-10-08 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00\n\n 81. We'll generate the data.\n\n 82. Note: The original data had 6 decimal places sometimes, but we are rounding to 3. We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 83. We'll now output the answer in the required format.\n\n 84. Due to the length, we will write a code in our mind to generate the 96 lines.\n\n 85. We'll do:\n\n        base = [24.015, 25.256, 26.497, 27.738]   # for day5,6,7,8\n        S = [-0.458791675, -0.845541675, -0.863541675, -0.722541675, -0.951041675, -0.775541675, -1.039291675, -1.303041675, -1.461291675, -1.901041675, -1.338291675, -0.722541675, 0.455458325, 1.370458325, 1.704458325, 1.334958325, 1.158958325, 0.455458325, 0.807208325, 0.789958325, 1.159208325, 1.247208325, 0.895208325, 0.789958325]\n\n        for day_index in range(4):\n            base_val = base[day_index]\n            for hour in range(24):\n                value = base_val + S[hour]\n                # format value to 3 decimal places\n                value_rounded = round(value, 3)\n                # date: \n                #   day = 5 + day_index\n                #   hour: from 0 to 23\n                date_str = f\"2016-10-0{5+day_index} {str(hour).zfill(2)}:00:00\"\n                print(f\"{date_str} {value_rounded}\")\n\n 86.

We'll now write the complete 96 lines.\n\n 89. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the given 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 90. We output the forecast.\n\n 91. But note: the method is simple and may not be very accurate, but it's a reasonable approach given the data.\n\n 92. We'll generate the data as described.\n\n 93. Due to the length, we will not list all 96 here in the thinking process, but we will output them in the answer.\n\n 94. We'll now write the answer in the required format.\n",
