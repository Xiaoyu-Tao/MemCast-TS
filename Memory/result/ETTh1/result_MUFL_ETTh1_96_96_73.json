        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (4 days * 24 hours) of the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) for a transformer.\n The data spans from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours).\n 2. There might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates does not have any missing values in the given sample.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality, we can use a seasonal decomposition or a model like SARIMA.\n\n However, note: The problem states that the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. \n Since we are forecasting, we must produce 96-step ahead forecast.\n\n Approach:\n - We'll use an automated approach to select the best SARIMA model parameters (using auto_arima) or use a simple seasonal model.\n - But note: We are not allowed to run code in this environment, so we have to rely on a typical approach.\n\n Given the constraints, we can describe the steps we would take and then provide a forecast.\n\n Steps we would take in a real scenario:\n  a) Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n  b) If non-stationary, difference the series (possibly with seasonal differencing).\n  c) Use an automated tool to fit a SARIMA model (e.g., pmdarima's auto_arima) to select the best parameters.\n\n However, without the ability to run code, we have to make an educated guess.\n\n Observing the data:\n  - The data shows a pattern: during the day (especially in the morning and afternoon) the load becomes negative (which might be due to the definition of the metric) and at night it is positive.\n  - The pattern repeats every 24 hours.\n\n We can try a SARIMA model with:\n  - Seasonal period: 24 (hourly data, daily seasonality)\n  - We might use (0,1,1) for non-seasonal and (0,1,1,24) for seasonal part? But without fitting, it's hard.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive method: \n   Forecast each hour of the next day as the value of the same hour from the same day in the previous week? \n   But we only have 4 days of data (so one week is not available). \n\n Since we only have 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But 4 days is not a full week.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify the exact method. We are the expert and we must provide the forecast.\n\n Given the complexity and without the ability to run code, we will generate a forecast by:\n  1. Decomposing the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components (using additive decomposition with period=24).\n  2. Extrapolate the trend component linearly (or using a moving average) for the next 96 points.\n  3. Use the seasonal component from the last available cycle (last 24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days (since we have 4 days, we can average the seasonal component for each hour?).\n\n But note: we cannot do that without code.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal forecast: \n   We will use the last day (2017-04-22) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that might not capture the trend.\n\n However, looking at the data, the trend over the 4 days is not very strong. We see that the values are somewhat similar.\n\n Let's try to compute the average for each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n Steps for averaging:\n   We have 4 days, so for hour 00:00: we have [8.599, 9.452, 8.742, 6.503] -> average = (8.599+9.452+8.742+6.503)/4 = 8.324\n   Similarly for each hour.\n\n But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We don't have a week. We have 4 consecutive days. And we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n However, without more data, we can assume that the pattern is stable.\n\n But also note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Since we are forced to provide an answer, we will generate the forecast by taking the average of each hour over the 4 days and then repeating that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n However, let's check the last day (2017-04-22) was a Saturday? and the next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n But we don't have information about the day of the week. The data starts on 2017-04-19 which is a Wednesday.\n\n 2017-04-19: Wednesday\n 2017-04-20: Thursday\n 2017-04-21: Friday\n 2017-04-22: Saturday\n\n Then the next 4 days: \n  2017-04-23: Sunday\n  2017-04-24: Monday\n  2017-04-25: Tuesday\n  2017-04-26: Wednesday\n\n We might expect that Sunday and Monday have different patterns? But we don't have historical Sundays or Mondays.\n\n Given the lack of data, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n How to compute:\n   For each hour (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from the 4 days). We average them.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n   Day1: 8.599, Day2:9.452, Day3:8.742, Day4:6.503 -> average = (8.599+9.452+8.742+6.503)/4 = 8.324\n\n We do this for each hour and then repeat the same pattern for 4 days.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? We can try to remove a linear trend and then add it back? \n\n However, without code, we do a simple average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (8.599 + 9.452 + 8.742 + 6.503) / 4 = 33.296 / 4 = 8.324\n Hour 1: (9.168 + 8.955 + 9.346 + 7.320) / 4 = 34.789 / 4 = 8.69725\n Hour 2: (7.960 + 9.950 + 8.422 + 5.934) / 4 = 32.266 / 4 = 8.0665\n Hour 3: (7.285 + 10.056 + 9.239 + 5.934) / 4 = 32.514 / 4 = 8.1285\n Hour 4: (9.772 + 11.229 + 8.280 + 5.224) / 4 = 34.505 / 4 = 8.62625\n Hour 5: (8.884 + 12.437 + 8.742 + 5.401) / 4 = 35.464 / 4 = 8.866\n Hour 6: (10.127 + 8.990 + 10.874 + 6.432) / 4 = 36.423 / 4 = 9.10575\n Hour 7: (5.153 + 6.432 + 8.351 + 3.447) / 4 = 23.383 / 4 = 5.84575\n Hour 8: (-3.092 + -1.777 + 2.097 + -6.219) / 4 = (-8.991) / 4 = -2.24775\n Hour 9: (-7.071 + -8.066 + -1.173 + -11.940) / 4 = (-28.25) / 4 = -7.0625\n Hour 10: (-9.132 + -12.579 + -6.254 + -15.173) / 4 = (-43.138) / 4 = -10.7845\n Hour 11: (-12.508 + -14.569 + -4.193 + -16.417) / 4 = (-47.687) / 4 = -11.92175\n Hour 12: (-13.859 + -16.950001 + -10.661 + -17.233999) / 4 = (-58.704) / 4 = -14.676\n Hour 13: (-4.513 + -10.589 + -6.965 + -18.301001) / 4 = (-40.368001) / 4 = -10.09200025\n Hour 14: (-6.361 + 1.777 + -2.168 + -6.005) / 4 = (-12.757) / 4 = -3.18925\n Hour 15: (-1.919 + -0.640 + -1.315 + -11.869) / 4 = (-15.743) / 4 = -3.93575\n Hour 16: (2.239 + 2.559 + 1.564 + -7.640) / 4 = (-1.278) / 4 = -0.3195\n Hour 17: (3.838 + 4.300 + 3.305 + -0.959) / 4 = 10.484 / 4 = 2.621\n Hour 18: (4.158 + 4.087 + 3.518 + 2.381) / 4 = 14.144 / 4 = 3.536\n Hour 19: (4.371 + 4.406 + 3.944 + 3.767) / 4 = 16.488 / 4 = 4.122\n Hour 20: (4.264 + 4.584 + 4.122 + 4.158) / 4 = 17.128 / 4 = 4.282\n Hour 21: (4.335 + 5.650 + 3.909 + 6.041) / 4 = 19.935 / 4 = 4.98375\n Hour 22: (5.046 + 6.112 + 3.518 + 6.716) / 4 = 21.392 / 4 = 5.348\n Hour 23: (8.351 + 9.772 + 5.543 + 8.280) / 4 = 31.946 / 4 = 7.9865\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is the above 24 numbers repeated 4 times.\n\n However, note: the last day (2017-04-22) was a Saturday and the next day is Sunday, which might be different. \n But without more data, we use the same pattern.\n\n But also note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't need to impute for the historical data.\n\n We are to output the next 96 points.\n\n Format: \n   We must output the date from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00, and the MUFL value (the average for that hour as computed above).\n\n However, we must note that the average might not be the best because the last day (Saturday) might be different from the next days (Sunday, Monday, ...). \n But we have no alternative.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the last day (2017-04-22) as the pattern for the next day (2017-04-23, Sunday) and then use the average for the rest? \n But we don't have a Sunday pattern.\n\n Given the instructions, we will use the average pattern for all 4 days.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n 2017-04-23 00:00:00: 8.324\n 2017-04-23 01:00:00: 8.69725\n 2017-04-23 02:00:00: 8.0665\n 2017-04-23 03:00:00: 8.1285\n 2017-04-23 04:00:00: 8.62625\n 2017-04-23 05:00:00: 8.866\n 2017-04-23 06:00:00: 9.10575\n 2017-04-23 07:00:00: 5.84575\n 2017-04-23 08:00:00: -2.24775\n 2017-04-23 09:00:00: -7.0625\n 2017-04-23 10:00:00: -10.7845\n 2017-04-23 11:00:00: -11.92175\n 2017-04-23 12:00:00: -14.676\n 2017-04-23 13:00:00: -10.09200025\n 2017-04-23 14:00:00: -3.18925\n 2017-04-23 15:00:00: -3.93575\n 2017-04-23 16:00:00: -0.3195\n 2017-04-23 17:00:00: 2.621\n 2017-04-23 18:00:00: 3.536\n 2017-04-23 19:00:00: 4.122\n 2017-04-23 20:00:00: 4.282\n 2017-04-23 21:00:00: 4.98375\n 2017-04-23 22:00:00: 5.348\n 2017-04-23 23:00:00: 7.9865\n\n Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next three days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. \n the next 96 points. So we output 96 rows.\n\n However, we must note that the average we computed is over 4 days, and we are using it for 4 days. \n\n But the problem does not specify the method, and we are using a simple average method.\n\n We output the data in the required format.\n\n Important: We must output the exact numbers we computed (with the same precision) and the dates.\n\n Let's write the dates:\n\n Start: 2017-04-23 00:00:00\n Then add 1 hour until 2017-04-26 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours).\n\n We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-23 00:00:00   8.324000\n2017-04-23 01:00:00   8.697250\n2017-04-23 02:00:00   8.066500\n2017-04-23 03:00:00   8.128500\n2017-04-23 04:00:00   8.626250\n2017-04-23 05:00:00   8.866000\n2017-04-23 06:00:00   9.105750\n2017-04-23 07:00:00   5.845750\n2017-04-23 08:00:00  -2.247750\n2017-04-23 09:00:00  -7.062500\n2017-04-23 10:00:00 -10.784500\n2017-04-23 11:00:00 -11.921750\n2017-04-23 12:00:00 -14.676000\n2017-04-23 13:00:00 -10.092000\n2017-04-23 14:00:00  -3.189250\n2017-04-23 15:00:00  -3.935750\n2017-04-23 16:00:00  -0.319500\n2017-04-23 17:00:00   2.621000\n2017-04-23 18:00:00   3.536000\n2017-04-23 19:00:00   4.122000\n2017-04-23 20:00:00   4.282000\n2017-04-23 21:00:00   4.983750\n2017-04-23 22:00:00   5.348000\n2017-04-23 23:00:00   7.986500\n2017-04-24 00:00:00   8.324000\n2017-04-24 01:00:00   8.697250\n... (and so on for 4 days)\n\n We'll write the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n But note: we computed the average for hour 13 as -10.09200025, we round to 6 decimal places? \n The input data had 3 decimal places, but we computed with more. We'll output with 6 decimal places to be consistent with the input (which had 3, but sometimes 6?).\n\n Actually, the input had up to 6 decimal places. So we output with 6.\n\n However, we computed with more precision, but we can output with 6.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll output the numbers as we computed (with 6 decimal places, by rounding to 6 if necessary).\n\n However, we computed:\n\n   Hour 13: -10.09200025 -> we can write as -10.092000\n\n But let's be consistent: we'll output the full float representation we have, but to 6 decimal places.\n\n Alternatively, we can output the exact fraction? But the problem does not specify.\n\n We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n But note: the input had 3 decimal places for some and 6 for others? Actually, the input had 8.599000 (6) and 9.168000 (6) and 7.960000 (6) ... so we output 6.\n\n So we'll round each of our computed averages to 6 decimal places.\n\n However, we computed:\n\n  8.324 -> 8.324000\n  8.69725 -> 8.697250\n  8.0665 -> 8.066500\n  ... \n\n So we can write:\n\n  8.324000\n  8.697250\n  8.066500\n  8.128500\n  8.626250\n  8.866000\n  9.105750\n  5.845750\n  -2.247750\n  -7.062500\n  -10.784500\n  -11.921750\n  -14.676000\n  -10.092000   (we round -10.09200025 to -10.092000)\n  -3.189250\n  -3.935750\n  -0.319500\n  2.621000\n  3.536000\n  4.122000\n  4.282000\n  4.983750\n  5.348000\n  7.986500\n\n And then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n  2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-23 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n  2017-04-24 00:00:00 to 2017-04-24 23:00:00 -> next 24\n  2017-04-25 00:00:00 to 2017-04-25 23:00:00\n  2017-04-26 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00\n\n We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", so we must output 96 rows.\n\n Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll write all 96 rows.\n\n Since it's repetitive, we can write the first day and then the next three days by repeating the same 24 numbers).\n\n We'll write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-23 00:00:00   8.324000\n2017-04-23 01:00:00   8.697250\n2017-04-23 02:00:00   8.066500\n2017-04-23 03:00:00   8.128500\n2017-04-23 04:00:00   8.626250\n2017-04-23 05:00:00   8.866000\n2017-04-23 06:00:00   9.105750\n2017-04-23 07:00:00   5.845750\n2017-04-23 08:00:00  -2.247750\n2017-04-23 09:00:00  -7.062500\n2017-04-23 10:00:00 -10.784500\n2017-04-23 11:00:00 -11.921750\n2017-04-23 12:00:00 -14.676000\n2017-04-23 13:00:00 -10.092000\n2017-04-23 14:00:00  -3.189250\n2017-04-23 15:00:00  -3.935750\n2017-04-23 16:00:00  -0.319500\n2017-04-23 17:00:00   2.621000\n2017-04-23 18:00:00   3.536000\n2017-04-23 19:00:00   4.122000\n2017-04-23 20:00:00   4.282000\n2017-04-23 21:00:00   4.983750\n2017-04-23 22:00:00   5.348000\n2017-04-23 23:00:00   7.986500\n2017-04-24 00:00:00   8.324000\n2017-04-24 01:00:00   8.697250\n2017-04-24 02:00:00   8.066500\n2017-04-24 03:00:00   8.128500\n2017-04-24 04:00:00   8.626250\n2017-04-24 05:00:00   8.866000\n2017-04-24 06:00:00   9.105750\n2017-04-24 07:00:00   5.845750\n2017-04-24 08:00:00  -2.247750\n2017-04-24 09:00:00  -7.062500\n2017-04-24 10:00:00 -10.784500\n2017-04-24 11:00:00 -11.921750\n2017-04-24 12:00:00 -14.676000\n2017-04-24 13:00:00 -10.092000\n2017-04-24 14:00:00  -3.189250\n2017-04-24 15:00:00  -3.935750\n2017-04-24 16:00:00  -0.319500\n2017-04-24 17:00:00   2.621000\n2017-04-24 18:00:00   3.536000\n2017-04-24 19:00:00   4.122000\n2017-04-24 20:00:00   4.282000\n2017-04-24 21:00:00   4.983750\n2017-04-24 22:00:00   5.348000\n2017-04-24 23:00:00   7.986500\n2017-04-25 00:00:00   8.324000\n2017-04-25 01:00:00   8.697250\n2017-04-25 02:00:00   8.066500\n2017-04-25 03:00:00   8.128500\n2017-04-25 04:00:00   8.626250\n2017-04-25 05:00:00   8.866000\n2017-04-25 06:00:00   9.105750\n2017-04-25 07:00:00   5.845750\n2017-04-25 08:00:00  -2.247750\n2017-04-25 09:00:00  -7.062500\n2017-04-25 10:00:00 -10.784500\n2017-04-25 11:00:00 -11.921750\n2017-04-25 12:00:00 -14.676000\n2017-04-25 13:00:00 -10.092000\n2017-04-25 14:00:00  -3.189250\n2017-04-25 15:00:00  -3.935750\n2017-04-25 16:00:00  -0.319500\n2017-04-25 17:00:00   2.621000\n2017-04-25 18:00:00   3.536000\n2017-04-25 19:00:00   4.122000\n2017-04-25 20:00:00   4.282000\n2017-04-25 21:00:00   4.983750\n2017-04-25 22:00:00   5.348000\n2017-04-25 23:00:00   7.986500\n2017-04-26 00:00:00   8.324000\n2017-04-26 01:00:00   8.697250\n2017-04-26 02:00:00   8.066500\n2017-04-26 03:00:00   8.128500\n2017-04-26 04:00:00   8.626250\n2017-04-26 05:00:00   8.866000\n2017-04-26 06:00:00   9.105750\n2017-04-26 07:00:00   5.845750\n2017-04-26 08:00:00  -2.247750\n2017-04-26 09:00:00  -7.062500\n2017-04-26 10:00:00 -10.784500\n2017-04-26 11:00:00 -11.921750\n2017-04-26 12:00:00 -14.676000\n2017-04-26 13:00:00 -10.092000\n2017-04-26 14:00:00  -3.189250\n2017-04-26 15:00:00  -3.935750\n2017-04-26 16:00:00  -0.319500\n2017-04-26 17:00:00   2.621000\n2017-04-26 18:00:00   3.536000\n2017-04-26 19:00:00   4.122000\n2017-04-26 20:00:00   4.282000\n2017-04-26 21:00:00   4.983750\n2017-04-26 22:00:00   5.348000\n2017-04-26 23:00:00   7.986500\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: we rounded the hour 13 value to -10.092000 (from -10.09200025) and others as well.\n\n This is a simple method.
