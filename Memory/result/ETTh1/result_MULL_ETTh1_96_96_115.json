        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. But for forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the input? Actually, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete. So we assume that the provided 96 points are as given and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 96 points and we have only 96 points of history, we need a method that can work with limited data and can capture potential seasonality and trends.\n\n 4. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be daily seasonality (24 hours). For example, the pattern from 00:00 to 23:00 repeats with variations.\n    - The data also shows some non-stationarity (e.g., on 2017-10-07 the values are much higher during the day).\n\n 5. Given the small data size, we can use a model that handles seasonality. One common method is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. However, with only 96 points, we must be cautious about overfitting.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days, or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 8. We are to forecast 96 points. We can break the problem into forecasting one day at a time, but we need to account for the trend and the fact that the last day (2017-10-07) has a significant peak.\n\n 9. Since the problem does not specify the model and we are to provide the forecast, we choose a method that is robust and can capture seasonality. We'll use a SARIMA model. However, with only 4 days of data, the seasonality period is 24, and we have 4 periods. This is very limited for SARIMA.\n\n10. Another approach is to use a rolling forecast with a simple model. Given the constraints, we might use a seasonal naive method: using the last available day (2017-10-07) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would ignore the trend and the data on 2017-10-07 is quite different from the previous days.\n\n11. We can also try to use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality. But with only 4 seasons, it might be challenging.\n\n12. Alternatively, we can use a linear model with time features (hour of day, day of week) but we only have 4 days and the next 4 days are from Monday to Thursday? Let's check the dates:\n\n    The last date is 2017-10-07 (Saturday). The next 96 hours (4 days) would be:\n        2017-10-08 (Sunday) to 2017-10-11 (Wednesday)\n\n    We have data from:\n        2017-10-04 (Wednesday) to 2017-10-07 (Saturday)\n\n    So we have 4 different days of the week. We can try to capture the hour-of-day effect and the day-of-week effect.\n\n13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to provide the forecast, we decide to use a simple method: \n    We will compute the average of each hour across the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days? But that would be a constant pattern for each hour and ignore any trend.\n\n14. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-10-07) as the base and adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But the days are not consistent.\n\n15. We can also try to use a moving average method with seasonality component. However, the problem requires 96 points and we must output the complete data.\n\n16. Considering the above, we choose to use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonality and the trend separately? But with only 4 days, decomposing trend and seasonality is difficult.\n\n17. We decide to use a simple method: \n    - We calculate the hourly average for the 4 days we have 4 observations per hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00). \n    - But note: the data on 2017-10-07 is much higher. So we might want to account for a trend. \n\n    We can compute the average per hour and then adjust by a linear trend? \n\n    Steps for the method:\n    a) Compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n    b) But we see that the level of the time series is increasing. We can compute the daily average and then project the daily average for the next 4 days using a linear regression on the daily averages? Then adjust the hourly profile by the projected daily average.\n\n    How to compute daily average? We can average the 24 hours for each day.\n\n    Daily averages:\n        2017-10-04: (1.954+1.670+...+(-0.213))/24 = let's compute quickly: \n            We can approximate: the numbers are around 0 to 2, but also negative. We can calculate exactly.\n\n    But note: we are to forecast 96 points. We can do:\n\n        Step 1: Aggregate the data to daily and forecast the daily total (or average) for the next 4 days.\n        Step 2: Decompose the intraday pattern (seasonality) by averaging the hourly data after removing the daily level? \n        Step 3: Then for each day in the forecast, we take the forecasted daily level and multiply by the intraday pattern (or add if we are in additive mode).\n\n    However, the data has negative values so multiplicative might not be suitable. We use additive.\n\n    Let D_i be the daily average for day i (i=1,2,3,4 for the 4 days we have).\n    Let H_h be the average hourly deviation for hour h (across the 4 days) from the daily average.\n\n    Then the forecast for day 5, hour h is: forecast_daily_avg_5 + H_h.\n\n    How to forecast the daily average for the next 4 days? We can use a simple linear regression on the daily averages.\n\n    The daily averages for the 4 days:\n        Day 1 (2017-10-04): \n            sum = 1.954+1.670+1.670+1.954+0.995+1.137+0.711+1.208-0.391+0.569+1.457+1.208+0.853+0.284+0.249+0.391-0.569-0.817-0.924-1.102-1.102-0.604-0.355-0.213\n            = 8.001 (let me calculate step by step)\n\n    Instead, we can compute the mean for each day:\n\n        Day1 (2017-10-04): \n            We have 24 values. We can compute the mean.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the provided data to compute the daily mean.\n\n    But note: we are in a time crunch. We can write a quick code in our mind.\n\n    We'll compute:\n\n        Day1: 2017-10-04: \n            Sum = 1.954+1.670+1.670+1.954+0.995+1.137+0.711+1.208-0.391+0.569+1.457+1.208+0.853+0.284+0.249+0.391-0.569-0.817-0.924-1.102-1.102-0.604-0.355-0.213\n            = (positive part) = 1.954+1.670+1.670+1.954+0.995+1.137+0.711+1.208+0.569+1.457+1.208+0.853+0.284+0.249+0.391 = 16.9\n            (negative part) = -0.391 -0.569 -0.817 -0.924 -1.102 -1.102 -0.604 -0.355 -0.213 = -6.077\n            Total = 16.9 - 6.077 = 10.823\n            Mean = 10.823 / 24 = 0.45096\n\n        Day2: 2017-10-05: \n            Values: -0.675, -0.178, -0.320, -0.320, -0.711, -0.355, -0.355, -0.426, 0.320, 0.746, 0.355, 0.178, -0.391, 0.036, 0.320, 0.036, -0.107, 0.036, -0.675, -0.391, -0.569, -1.635, 0.178, 1.066\n            Positive: 0.320+0.746+0.355+0.178+0.036+0.320+0.036+0.036+0.178+1.066 = 3.271\n            Negative: -0.675-0.178-0.320-0.320-0.711-0.355-0.355-0.426-0.391-0.107-0.675-0.391-0.569-1.635 = -7.108\n            Total = 3.271 - 7.108 = -3.837\n            Mean = -3.837/24 = -0.159875\n\n        Day3: 2017-10-06: \n            Values: 1.031,0.924,0.569,0.533,0.782,0.533,0.604,0.888,1.777,0.391,2.878,0.888,0.888,1.031,0.355,1.279,0.924,0.426,-0.497,0.036,-0.071,-0.391,0.000,0.533\n            Positive: 1.031+0.924+0.569+0.533+0.782+0.533+0.604+0.888+1.777+0.391+2.878+0.888+0.888+1.031+0.355+1.279+0.924+0.426+0.036+0.000+0.533 = 17.311\n            Negative: -0.497-0.071-0.391 = -0.959\n            Total = 17.311 - 0.959 = 16.352\n            Mean = 16.352/24 = 0.68133\n\n        Day4: 2017-10-07: \n            Values: 0.924,0.569,0.888,0.888,1.137,0.320,0.924,1.670,1.741,2.381,3.696,4.406,4.406,4.833,4.229,2.310,1.350,0.675,-0.391,0.284,0.249,0.213,1.457,2.203\n            Positive: all are positive except one: -0.391\n            Sum = 0.924+0.569+0.888+0.888+1.137+0.320+0.924+1.670+1.741+2.381+3.696+4.406+4.406+4.833+4.229+2.310+1.350+0.675+0.284+0.249+0.213+1.457+2.203 -0.391\n            = (positive without the last negative) = 41.399\n            Then subtract 0.391: 41.008\n            Mean = 41.008/24 = 1.70867\n\n    So the daily averages: [0.45096, -0.159875, 0.68133, 1.70867]\n\n    Now, we can fit a linear trend to these 4 points and project the next 4 days.\n\n    Let time points: t=1,2,3,4 for the 4 days.\n\n    We want to fit: y = a + b*t\n\n    Using linear regression:\n\n        t = [1,2,3,4]\n        y = [0.45096, -0.159875, 0.68133, 1.70867]\n\n        mean_t = (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5\n        mean_y = (0.45096 -0.159875 +0.68133+1.70867)/4 = (2.681085)/4 = 0.67027125\n\n        b = \u03a3((t_i - mean_t)*(y_i - mean_y)) / \u03a3((t_i - mean_t)^2)\n\n        Let's compute:\n\n            t1: (1-2.5) = -1.5, (0.45096-0.67027125) = -0.21931125 -> product = (-1.5)*(-0.21931125)=0.328966875\n            t2: (2-2.5)=-0.5, (-0.159875-0.67027125)= -0.83014625 -> product = (-0.5)*(-0.83014625)=0.415073125\n            t3: (3-2.5)=0.5, (0.68133-0.67027125)=0.01105875 -> product=0.5*0.01105875=0.005529375\n            t4: (4-2.5)=1.5, (1.70867-0.67027125)=1.03839875 -> product=1.5*1.03839875=1.557598125\n\n        Sum of products = 0.328966875+0.415073125+0.005529375+1.557598125 = 2.3071675\n\n        Sum of squares of (t_i - mean_t) = (-1.5)^2 + (-0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (1.5)^2 = 2.25+0.25+0.25+2.25 = 5.0\n\n        b = 2.3071675 / 5.0 = 0.4614335\n\n        a = mean_y - b * mean_t = 0.67027125 - 0.4614335 * 2.5 = 0.67027125 - 1.15358375 = -0.4833125\n\n        So the model: y = -0.4833125 + 0.4614335 * t\n\n        Forecast for t=5: y5 = -0.4833125 + 0.4614335*5 = -0.4833125 + 2.3071675 = 1.823855\n        t=6: y6 = -0.4833125 + 0.4614335*6 = -0.4833125 + 2.768601 = 2.2852885\n        t=7: y7 = -0.4833125 + 0.4614335*7 = -0.4833125 + 3.2300345 = 2.746722\n        t=8: y8 = -0.4833125 + 0.4614335*8 = -0.4833125 + 3.691468 = 3.2081555\n\n    Now, we compute the hourly deviations:\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23), we compute the average deviation from the daily mean for that day.\n\n        For hour0 (00:00): \n            Day1: 1.954 - 0.45096 = 1.50304\n            Day2: -0.675 - (-0.159875) = -0.515125\n            Day3: 1.031 - 0.68133 = 0.34967\n            Day4: 0.924 - 1.70867 = -0.78467\n            Average = (1.50304 -0.515125 +0.34967 -0.78467)/4 = (1.50304+0.34967 = 1.85271; -0.515125-0.78467=-1.299795) -> (1.552915)/4? Actually: (1.50304 -0.515125 +0.34967 -0.78467) = (1.50304+0.34967) = 1.85271; (-0.515125-0.78467) = -1.299795; then 1.85271 - 1.299795 = 0.552915; then /4 = 0.13822875\n\n        But note: we have 4 days, so we can average.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But we have only 4 points.\n\n        We'll use the average.\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n    Then for the forecast for day5 (t=5) at hour0: \n        = forecast_daily_avg_5 + average_deviation_hour0 \n        = 1.823855 + 0.13822875 = 1.96208375\n\n    Similarly for the rest.\n\n    However, note: the daily average we forecasted is the mean of the day. We are then adding the hourly deviation (which is the average of the hour's deviation from the daily mean in the past). \n\n    But we must note: the hourly deviations are computed from the past 4 days. \n\n    This method is simple and we have to do it for 24 hours and 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: For each hour in 0..23, compute:\n            dev_hour = [value_day1_hour - daily_avg_day1, value_day2_hour - daily_avg_day2, value_day3_hour - daily_avg_day3, value_day4_hour - daily_avg_day4]\n            Then average_dev_hour = average(dev_hour)\n\n        Step 2: For each day in the next 4 days (t=5,6,7,8) and for each hour (0..23):\n            forecast = (a + b * t) + average_dev_hour\n\n    But note: the days are consecutive and the next 4 days are 2017-10-08 (Sunday) to 2017-10-11 (Wednesday). Our historical data includes Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. The next days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So we are forecasting for different days of the week. However, we don't have data for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday in the history. So we are using the same hourly pattern? This might not be accurate, but we have no other data.\n\n    Alternatively, we could group by day of week? But we only have one week and not the same days. We have only one Wednesday, one Thursday, one Friday, one Saturday. So we cannot average by day of week. We have to use the overall hourly average deviation.\n\n    We proceed with the above.\n\n    However, note: the last day (Saturday) had a very different pattern (with high peak during the day). The next Sunday might be similar to Saturday? But we don't have data. So we are forced to use the average.\n\n    We'll compute the average deviation for each hour from the 4 days.\n\n    Let's compute the hourly deviations:\n\n        We have the daily averages: \n            day1_avg = 0.45096\n            day2_avg = -0.159875\n            day3_avg = 0.68133\n            day4_avg = 1.70867\n\n        For hour0 (00:00):\n            day1: 1.954 - 0.45096 = 1.50304\n            day2: -0.675 - (-0.159875) = -0.515125\n            day3: 1.031 - 0.68133 = 0.34967\n            day4: 0.924 - 1.70867 = -0.78467\n            avg_dev0 = (1.50304 -0.515125 +0.34967 -0.78467)/4 = (1.50304+0.34967) = 1.85271; (-0.515125-0.78467) = -1.299795; total = 1.85271 - 1.299795 = 0.552915; then /4 = 0.13822875\n\n        Similarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\n    We'll compute the average deviation for each hour.\n\n    But note: we must be cautious because the data has negative values and the deviations can be negative.\n\n    We do the calculation for all 24 hours.\n\n    We'll create a list for the average deviation for hour0 to hour23.\n\n    Then we forecast:\n\n        Day5 (2017-10-08, Sunday): t=5 -> daily_avg5 = 1.823855\n        Then for hour0: 1.823855 + 0.13822875 = 1.96208375\n        hour1: 1.823855 + avg_dev1\n        ...\n\n        Day6 (2017-10-09, Monday): t=6 -> daily_avg6 = 2.2852885\n        Then for hour0: 2.2852885 + 0.13822875 = 2.42351725\n        ...\n\n    We do this for 4 days.\n\n    However, note: the next 96 hours are 4 days, so 24*4=96.\n\n    We must generate the dates as well. The last date in the given data is 2017-10-07 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-10-08 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n    We'll generate the dates and then the forecasted MULL.\n\n    But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not encountered in the provided 96, but for the forecast, we are generating a complete set.\n\n    We must output the complete 96 points.\n\n    Let's code this in our mind and output.\n\n    However, note: the calculation of the average deviation for 24 hours is tedious by hand. We have to do it for 24 hours.\n\n    We'll do it step by step.\n\n    We have the data for the 4 days in 24 columns? Actually, we have 24 rows per day.\n\n    We can reorganize the data by hour:\n\n        hour0: [1.954 (day1), -0.675 (day2), 1.031 (day3), 0.924 (day4)]\n        hour1: [1.670, -0.178, 0.924, 0.569]\n        ... \n\n    Then for each hour, we subtract the corresponding daily average and then average the deviations.\n\n    We'll compute the deviations for each hour:\n\n        dev_hour_i = [ value_i_day1 - day1_avg, value_i_day2 - day2_avg, value_i_day3 - day3_avg, value_i_day4 - day4_avg ]\n\n    Then avg_dev_i = sum(dev_hour_i) / 4\n\n    We do for i=0 to 23.\n\n    Then we have the avg_dev for each hour.\n\n    Then for each forecast day (5,6,7,8) and for each hour i, the forecast = (a + b * day_index)) + avg_dev_i\n\n    Where day_index for the forecast days: \n        day5: t=5\n        day6: t=6\n        day7: t=7\n        day8: t=8\n\n    We then output the data in the same format: date and MULL.\n\n    Steps to generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-10-08 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-10-08 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-08 23:00:00 -> day5\n        Then 2017-10-09 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-09 23:00:00 -> day6\n        Then 2017-10-10 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-10 23:00:00 -> day7\n        Then 2017-10-11 00:00:00 ... until 2017-10-11 23:00:00 -> day8\n\n    We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n    We must be cautious: the daily averages we computed are for the entire day. We are using the same hourly pattern for each day.\n\n    Let's compute the average deviations for each hour:\n\n        We have:\n            day1_avg = 0.45096\n            day2_avg = -0.159875\n
