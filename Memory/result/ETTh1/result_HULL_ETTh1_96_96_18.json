        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, the provided sample for the past 96 is complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data, we can consider a model that captures daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting and can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. We'll use an additive exponential smoothing model (Holt-Winters) with a seasonality of 24 periods (since data is hourly and daily seasonality is expected). Alternatively, we can use SARIMA.\n\n However, note: the data provided is only 4 days. We have to be cautious.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or naive methods, but they might not capture the seasonality.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the fact that we are required to provide a complete forecast, we choose to use a model that can handle seasonality. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels.\n\n 7. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n    - Check for missing values and impute if necessary (but in the given 96 points, there are none).\n    - Fit an ExponentialSmoothing model with trend and seasonal components (additive seasonality) and seasonal period of 24.\n    - Forecast the next 96 steps.\n\n 8. However, since we are not executing code, we must rely on a method that we can reason about.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we are to provide the forecast. We can simulate the process by:\n\n    a) Observing the pattern: \n        - The data shows a daily pattern: \n          * During the day (from 00:00 to about 12:00) the values are higher and then they drop in the afternoon and evening? \n          * But looking at the data, it's not very clear. However, we can see that the values at night (around 21:00) are lower.\n\n    b) We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n       But that would be too naive and ignore any trend.\n\n    c) Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the last 24 hours to forecast the next 24 hours? But we need 96 hours.\n\n 10. Given the requirement and the fact that we are to provide the data, we will use a simple method: \n     - We'll decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n     - Then we can project the trend forward (using a linear trend) and add the seasonal component.\n\n 11. However, without actual computation, we have to make an estimation.\n\n 12. Since the problem requires a complete answer, we will generate the forecast by:\n\n     Step 1: Calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n        hour0: [5.894, 4.488, 4.421, 6.363] -> average = (5.894+4.488+4.421+6.363)/4 = 5.2915\n        hour1: [5.425, 5.224, 4.354, 6.363] -> (5.425+5.224+4.354+6.363)/4 = 5.3415\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Step 2: But we note that there might be a slight trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n        Day1 (2016-09-11): average = (sum of 24 values) \n        Day2: average\n        Day3: average\n        Day4: average\n\n     We can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n          5.894,5.425,5.961,5.291,6.430,4.890,5.090,5.425,4.421,5.894,4.890,4.689,3.550,3.416,4.689,3.282,3.416,3.617,3.416,3.148,3.148,2.210,3.148,4.421\n          Sum = 104.822, average = 4.367583\n\n        Day2:\n          4.488,5.224,5.224,4.756,4.689,4.220,4.153,5.291,5.559,3.885,4.086,3.952,3.215,3.952,3.952,3.751,3.885,3.818,3.483,3.215,3.215,1.875,4.019,3.617\n          Sum = 94.165, average = 3.923542\n\n        Day3:\n          4.421,4.354,4.823,4.890,4.823,4.555,4.689,4.555,4.823,3.818,4.622,4.153,3.282,2.947,3.550,4.153,3.818,2.947,3.148,3.416,3.483,3.215,4.153,5.157\n          Sum = 95.186, average = 3.966083\n\n        Day4:\n          6.363,6.363,3.617,5.023,4.086,4.153,4.488,5.894,6.028,5.559,5.425,4.823,3.550,3.885,3.684,4.153,3.550,3.282,3.215,3.081,2.947,3.014,4.488,4.756\n          Sum = 100.387, average = 4.182792\n\n     The daily averages are: 4.367, 3.923, 3.966, 4.183 -> there is a slight dip on day2 and then a rise? But not a clear trend.\n\n     Step 3: We can use the average of the last two days (day3 and day4) to adjust the base level? Or we can use the overall average.\n\n     Step 4: We'll use the seasonal indices (the average for each hour) and then adjust by the overall average of the entire series? \n\n        Overall average of all 96 points: (104.822+94.165+95.186+100.387)/96 = 394.56/96 = 4.11\n\n        Then for each hour, we have a seasonal index = (average for that hour) / 4.11\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we set the base level as the last day's average (4.183) or the overall average? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last day (day4) as the base and then apply the seasonal index.\n\n     Step 5: We decide to use the average of the last day (day4: 4.183) as the base for the next day? But we have 4 days to forecast.\n\n     However, without a clear trend, we can assume the level is constant? So we use the overall average of the entire series (4.11) and then multiply by the seasonal index? \n\n     But note: we are doing additive or multiplicative? The data does not show increasing variance with level, so additive might be okay.\n\n     Actually, we did additive decomposition: value = base + seasonal.\n\n     We can compute the seasonal component for each hour as: (average of that hour) - overall_average.\n\n     Then for forecasting, we take the overall_average (or the level of the last period) and add the seasonal component.\n\n     We'll use the overall average as the base level for the forecast? But the level might be changing. We can use the average of the last day (4.183) as the base for the first forecast day, then for the next days we can use the same base? Or we can use a moving base? \n\n     Since we don't have a clear trend, we'll assume the level is constant at the overall average (4.11) for the next 4 days.\n\n     Then the forecast for hour i (i from 0 to 23) of any day in the forecast period would be: \n        forecast = overall_average + seasonal_index_i\n\n     But note: the seasonal index for hour i is: (average of that hour over 4 days) - overall_average.\n\n     Then: forecast = overall_average + (average_hour_i - overall_average) = average_hour_i\n\n     So that would be just the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n     Therefore, we can simply repeat the 4-day hourly averages for the next 4 days? \n\n     However, we have 4 days of history and we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the average of each hour over the 4 days as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 13. But note: the last day (day4) had an average of 4.183, which is above the overall average (4.11). So if we use the average of the hour, we are already incorporating the recent level? \n\n 14. Therefore, we will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (each day in the forecast will have the same 24 values, which are the averages by hour).\n\n 15. Steps:\n\n     hour0: (5.894 + 4.488 + 4.421 + 6.363) / 4 = 5.2915\n     hour1: (5.425 + 5.224 + 4.354 + 6.363) / 4 = 5.3415\n     hour2: (5.961 + 5.224 + 4.823 + 3.617) / 4 = 4.90625\n     hour3: (5.291 + 4.756 + 4.890 + 5.023) / 4 = 4.99\n     hour4: (6.430 + 4.689 + 4.823 + 4.086) / 4 = 5.007\n     hour5: (4.890 + 4.220 + 4.555 + 4.153) / 4 = 4.4545\n     hour6: (5.090 + 4.153 + 4.689 + 4.488) / 4 = 4.605\n     hour7: (5.425 + 5.291 + 4.555 + 5.894) / 4 = 5.29125\n     hour8: (4.421 + 5.559 + 4.823 + 6.028) / 4 = 5.20775\n     hour9: (5.894 + 3.885 + 3.818 + 5.559) / 4 = 4.789\n     hour10: (4.890 + 4.086 + 4.622 + 5.425) / 4 = 4.75575\n     hour11: (4.689 + 3.952 + 4.153 + 4.823) / 4 = 4.40425\n     hour12: (3.550 + 3.215 + 3.282 + 3.550) / 4 = 3.39925\n     hour13: (3.416 + 3.952 + 2.947 + 3.885) / 4 = 3.550\n     hour14: (4.689 + 3.952 + 3.550 + 3.684) / 4 = 3.96875\n     hour15: (3.282 + 3.751 + 4.153 + 4.153) / 4 = 3.83475\n     hour16: (3.416 + 3.885 + 3.818 + 3.550) / 4 = 3.66725\n     hour17: (3.617 + 3.818 + 2.947 + 3.282) / 4 = 3.416\n     hour18: (3.416 + 3.483 + 3.148 + 3.215) / 4 = 3.3155\n     hour19: (3.148 + 3.215 + 3.416 + 3.081) / 4 = 3.215\n     hour20: (3.148 + 3.215 + 3.483 + 2.947) / 4 = 3.19825\n     hour21: (2.210 + 1.875 + 3.215 + 3.014) / 4 = 2.5785\n     hour22: (3.148 + 4.019 + 4.153 + 4.488) / 4 = 3.952\n     hour23: (4.421 + 3.617 + 5.157 + 4.756) / 4 = 4.48775\n\n 16. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-09-15 to 2016-09-18) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-09-15): \n          00:00: 5.2915\n          01:00: 5.3415\n          02:00: 4.90625\n          03:00: 4.99\n          04:00: 5.007\n          05:00: 4.4545\n          06:00: 4.605\n          07:00: 5.29125\n          08:00: 5.20775\n          09:00: 4.789\n          10:00: 4.75575\n          11:00: 4.40425\n          12:00: 3.39925\n          13:00: 3.550\n          14:00: 3.96875\n          15:00: 3.83475\n          16:00: 3.66725\n          17:00: 3.416\n          18:00: 3.3155\n          19:00: 3.215\n          20:00: 3.19825\n          21:00: 2.5785\n          22:00: 3.952\n          23:00: 4.48775\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 17. But note: the dates must be continuous. The last date in the input is 2016-09-14 23:00:00, so the next day starts at 2016-09-15 00:00:00.\n\n 18. We'll generate 96 data points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n 19. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, with the date and the HULL value.\n\n 20. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 21. However, note: the input has some variation and our forecast is just the average. This is a simple method but might be acceptable given the small data.\n\n 22. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n 23. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 24. The values for 2016-09-15:\n\n        00:00:00 -> 5.292 (rounded to 3 decimals: 5.2915 -> 5.292)\n        01:00:00 -> 5.342\n        02:00:00 -> 4.906\n        03:00:00 -> 4.990\n        04:00:00 -> 5.007\n        05:00:00 -> 4.455\n        06:00:00 -> 4.605\n        07:00:00 -> 5.291\n        08:00:00 -> 5.208\n        09:00:00 -> 4.789\n        10:00:00 -> 4.756\n        11:00:00 -> 4.404\n        12:00:00 -> 3.399\n        13:00:00 -> 3.550\n        14:00:00 -> 3.969\n        15:00:00 -> 3.835\n        16:00:00 -> 3.667\n        17:00:00 -> 3.416\n        18:00:00 -> 3.316\n        19:00:00 -> 3.215\n        20:00:00 -> 3.198\n        21:00:00 -> 2.579\n        22:00:00 -> 3.952\n        23:00:00 -> 4.488\n\n    Then the same 24 values for 2016-09-16, 2016-09-17, 2016-09-18.\n\n 25. But note: the input data has a value like 5.894, 5.425, etc. so we are keeping 3 decimals.\n\n 26. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 27. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 28. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 29. We output the next 96 points.\n\n 30. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-09-18 23:00:00\n\n        We'll generate 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 31. We'll create the data:\n\n        date, HULL\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00,5.292\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00,5.342\n        ... \n        until 2016-09-18 23:00:00,4.488\n\n 32. We note that the same 24 values repeat for each day.\n\n 33. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 34. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 5.292\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00 5.342\n        ... \n        2016-09-18 23:00:00 4.488\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n 35. But note: the input had a space between the date and the value? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2016-09-11 00:00:00 5.894\"\n\n     So we'll output: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS value\" (space separated)\n\n 36. We generate the data accordingly.\n\n 37. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 38. We must be cautious: the rounding. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. Let's do the rounding for each:\n\n        hour0: 5.2915 -> 5.292\n        hour1: 5.3415 -> 5.342\n        hour2: 4.90625 -> 4.906\n        hour3: 4.99 -> 4.990 (but note: 4.99 is 4.990, but we can write 4.990 to show 3 decimals? or 4.99? The input has 3 decimals always? \n\n        Check input: \n          5.894 -> 3 decimals\n          5.425 -> 3 decimals\n          5.291 -> 3 decimals\n\n        So we should output 3 decimals. For hour3: 4.99 -> we can write 4.990? or 4.99? \n\n        Actually, 4.99 is the same as 4.990. But to be consistent, we'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n        We can format to 3 decimal places: \n          5.2915 -> format to 3 decimals: 5.292\n          4.99 -> 4.990\n\n        How? \n          5.2915: \n            5.2915 * 1000 = 5291.5 -> round to integer: 5292 -> then 5.292\n          4.99: \n            4.99 * 1000 = 4990 -> then 4.990\n\n        We can do: \n            value = round(average, 3)\n\n        But note: rounding 4.90625 to 3 decimals: \n            round(4.90625, 3) -> 4.906\n\n        So we'll use rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n 40. We recalc the averages and round to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 5.2915 -> 5.292\n        hour1: 5.3415 -> 5.342\n        hour2: 4.90625 -> 4.906\n        hour3: 4.99 -> 4.990\n        hour4: 5.007 -> 5.007\n        hour5: 4.4545 -> 4.455\n        hour6: 4.605 -> 4.605\n        hour7: 5.29125 -> 5.291\n        hour8: 5.20775 -> 5.208\n        hour9: 4.789 -> 4.789\n        hour10: 4.75575 -> 4.756\n        hour11: 4.40425 -> 4.404\n        hour12: 3.39925 -> 3.399\n        hour13: 3.550 -> 3.550\n        hour14: 3.96875 -> 3.969\n        hour15: 3.83475 -> 3.835\n        hour16: 3.66725 -> 3.667\n        hour17: 3.416 -> 3.416\n        hour18: 3.3155 -> 3.316\n        hour19: 3.215 -> 3.215\n        hour20: 3.19825 -> 3.198\n        hour21: 2.5785 -> 2.579\n        hour22: 3.952 -> 3.952\n        hour23: 4.48775 -> 4.488\n\n 41. Now we write the data.\n\n 42. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-15\n        Day2: 2016-09-16\n        Day3: 2016-09-17\n        Day4: 2016-09-18\n\n        For each day, 24 hours: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n 43. We output:\n\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 5.292\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00 5.342\n        2016-09-15 02:00:00 4.906\n        2016-09-15 03:00:00 4.990\n        2016-09-15 04:00:00 5.007\n        2016-09-15 05:00:00 4.455\n        2016-09-15 06:00:00 4.605\n        2016-09-15 07:00:00 5.291\n        2016-09-15 08:00:00 5.208\n        2016-09-15 09:00:00 4.789\n        2016-09-15 10:00:00 4.756\n        2016-09-15 11:00:00 4.404\n        2016-09-15 12:00:00 3.399\n        2016-09-15 13:00:00 3.550\n        2016-09-15 14:00:00 3.969\n        2016-09-15 15:00:00 3.835\n        2016-09-15 16:00:00 3.667\n        2016-09-15 17:00:00 3.416\n        2016-09-15 18:00:00 3.316\n        2016-09-15 19:00:00 3.215\n        2016-09-15 20:00:00 3.198\n        2016-09-15 21:00:00 2.579\n        2016-09-15 22:00:00 3.952\n        2016-09-15 23:00:00 4.488\n\n        Then the same for 2016-09-16, 2016-09-17, 2016-09-18.\n\n 44. We note: the last value for 2016-09-18 23:00:00 is 4.488.\n\n 45. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 46. We must be cautious: the date format is exactly as in the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 47. We output in the required format.\n\n 48. Since the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\", we output all 96.\n\n 49. We write the answer.\n",
