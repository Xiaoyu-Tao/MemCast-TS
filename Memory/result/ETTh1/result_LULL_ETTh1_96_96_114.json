        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load is generally higher (less negative) during the day and lower (more negative) at night, with peaks in the evening.\n 2. The data also shows some weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture a weekly seasonality. We'll stick to daily seasonality.\n 3. We must handle missing values, but in the provided data there are no missing values in the given 96 points. However, the problem states that the data may have missing values. Since we are only given 96 points without any missing, we can proceed without imputation for the historical data. But for forecasting, we need to produce 96 points without any missing.\n\n Approach:\n We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the hourly data and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Since we are in a constrained environment without the ability to run complex models, we are to provide a forecast using a library if possible? But note: we are to output the next 96 points.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can use the entire 96 points to forecast.\n\n We can use a simple method: \n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n   - But note: the last day (2017-10-03) is a Tuesday? and we are forecasting the next 4 days (from 2017-10-04 to 2017-10-07). We don't have a Wednesday in the history? Actually, we have:\n        Sep 30 (Saturday), Oct 1 (Sunday), Oct 2 (Monday), Oct 3 (Tuesday)\n\n   We are to forecast from Oct 4 (Wednesday) 00:00:00 to Oct 7 (Saturday) 23:00:00.\n\n   We can do:\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have 4 observations (from the 4 days). We can take the average of the same hour for the next day.\n\n   However, note that the pattern might change by day of the week. But we only have one week? Actually, we have 4 consecutive days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.\n\n   We are forecasting Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n   We can we do?\n        For Wednesday: we don't have a Wednesday in the past, so we can use the average of the same hour of the last 4 days? or we can use the average of the same hour of the last Tuesday? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available days. But note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) might be different from weekdays.\n\n   Since we have only 4 days, we can break it:\n        For the next 4 days: \n          Day 1: Wednesday -> we can use the average of the same hour from the last two weekdays (Monday and Tuesday) because they are weekdays? \n          But we don't have a Wednesday. Alternatively, we can use the average of all 4 days? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the day of the week effect. We have limited data.\n\n   Another idea: use the last day (Tuesday) as a template and adjust by the average change from the previous day? \n\n   But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 points. We have to make a decision.\n\n   Let's do a simple average by hour over the 4 days. This will smooth out the daily pattern and ignore the day-of-week. Since we have only 4 days and they are consecutive, and we are forecasting the next 4 days, we can use:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the forecasted day, the value = average of the same hour h from the 4 historical days.\n\n   But note: the last day (Tuesday) might be the most representative for the next Wednesday? But we don't know.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? \n\n   However, the problem context doesn't give more information. We'll go with the average per hour.\n\n   Steps:\n        Group the historical data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n        Then, for each of the next 96 hours (which are 4 days * 24 hours), we assign the mean of that hour.\n\n   But note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last 4 days: \n        The values seem to be getting more negative? \n        For example, at 00:00: \n            2017-09-30 00:00:00 -0.944\n            2017-10-01 00:00:00 -0.822\n            2017-10-02 00:00:00 -0.853\n            2017-10-03 00:00:00 -1.005\n\n        The average for 00:00: (-0.944 -0.822 -0.853 -1.005)/4 = -0.624/4 = -0.906\n\n        But the last day was -1.005, which is lower. \n\n   We can also consider a drift? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average method with seasonality. \n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only to provide a forecast, we'll use the average per hour.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"You are an expert\", so we should use a more robust method? But we are limited by the data and the fact that we cannot run complex models.\n\n   Another idea: use the last day (2017-10-03) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous day? \n\n   But we are not sure.\n\n   Let me try to see the pattern:\n\n        The data from 2017-10-03 (Tuesday) is the most recent. We can use that day as the pattern and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n   We have 4 days, so we can compute the average of the entire 4 days and then the average of the last day? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality? But we have to do it manually? \n\n   Given the constraints, we choose the average per hour.\n\n   Steps for average per hour:\n\n        Step 1: Extract the hour from the timestamp for each record.\n        Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean of LULL for that hour.\n\n        Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   But note: the first forecasted day is Wednesday, then Thursday, Friday, Saturday. We are using the same pattern for all days.\n\n   However, we have a Saturday in the history (2017-09-30) and we are forecasting a Saturday (2017-10-07). We could use the Saturday pattern for that day? But we only have one Saturday.\n\n   Since we don't have enough data to model day-of-week, we use the same average for every day.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        We'll create a list of the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-10-04 00:00:00, then 2017-10-04 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-07 23:00:00.\n\n        For each timestamp, we extract the hour (0 to 23) and then assign the precomputed mean for that hour.\n\n   But note: the data we are given ends at 2017-10-03 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2017-10-04 00:00:00.\n\n   How to compute the mean for each hour:\n\n        We have 4 days, so for hour 0: \n            dates: 2017-09-30 00:00:00, 2017-10-01 00:00:00, 2017-10-02 00:00:00, 2017-10-03 00:00:00\n            values: -0.944, -0.822, -0.853, -1.005 -> mean = (-0.944 -0.822 -0.853 -1.005)/4 = -3.624/4 = -0.906\n\n        Similarly for hour 1: \n            values: -1.066, -0.883, -0.914, -1.036 -> mean = (-1.066 -0.883 -0.914 -1.036)/4 = -3.899/4 = -0.97475\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then we output 4 days of these 24 mean values.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and the values are negative? That might be normalized. We don't have to worry.\n\n   But wait: the data might have a trend? The last day (Tuesday) is generally lower (more negative) than the previous days. So if we use the average, we are smoothing out the trend. \n\n   Alternative: use a naive forecast: use the last day (Tuesday) repeated for the next 4 days? \n\n        Then the forecast for 2017-10-04 00:00:00 would be the same as 2017-10-03 00:00:00 (-1.005), and so on.\n\n        But then we are ignoring the trend? \n\n   We can try to adjust by the trend? \n\n        We can compute the average change per day? \n\n        For example, from day1 to day2: \n            total change = (day2 average - day1 average) \n        But we have 4 days, we can compute the average daily change? \n\n        However, we are forecasting 4 days ahead, so we can add 4 times the average daily change? \n\n        But note: the average daily change might be:\n\n            Day1 (Sep30): average = (-0.944 -1.066 ... )/24\n            Day2 (Oct1): average = ... \n            Then compute the differences? \n\n        This might be too much.\n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we choose the average per hour method.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we don't have any in the provided data. So we are safe.\n\n   We'll compute the mean for each hour and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n   Let's compute the mean for each hour:\n\n        We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and then 4 values.\n\n        Hour 0: [ -0.944, -0.822, -0.853, -1.005] -> mean = -0.906\n        Hour 1: [ -1.066, -0.883, -0.914, -1.036] -> mean = -0.883 + (-0.914) = -1.797, then -1.066 and -1.036 -> total = -1.066 -0.883 -0.914 -1.036 = -3.899 -> mean = -0.97475\n        ... \n\n   We'll do for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2017-10-04 (Wednesday): [ mean_hour0, mean_hour1, ... mean_hour23 ]\n        Day2: 2017-10-05 (Thursday): same as above\n        Day3: 2017-10-06 (Friday): same\n        Day4: 2017-10-07 (Saturday): same\n\n   We output 96 rows.\n\n   Format: \n        date in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n        LULL: the forecasted value (with 3 decimal places? as in the input)\n\n   We note that the input has 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Let's compute the means:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and then compute.\n\n        We have the data in order. We can group by the hour part of the datetime.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            hours = {}\n            for each row in the given data:\n                dt = row['date']\n                hour = dt.split()[1]  # but we have the time part, e.g., '00:00:00'\n                hour = int(hour.split(':')[0])\n\n            Then append the value to hours[hour]\n\n            Then for each hour in 0..23: \n                mean = round( sum(hours[hour]) / len(hours[hour]), 3)\n\n        But note: we have exactly 4 values for each hour? because 4 days? \n\n        Yes, 4 days * 24 hours = 96, so each hour has 4 values.\n\n   Then we create the forecast:\n\n        start_date = '2017-10-04 00:00:00'\n        Then we generate 96 hours: 4 days.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n            base = datetime(2017, 10, 4, 0, 0, 0)\n            for i in range(96):\n                current = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n                hour = current.hour\n                value = mean_values[hour]   # mean_values is a list of 24 values for hour0 to hour23\n                print(f\"{current.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')} {value:.3f}\")\n\n   But note: we are in a text environment, so we have to compute without datetime? \n\n   Alternatively, we can generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-10-04\n            hours: 00,01,...,23\n        Day2: 2017-10-05\n        Day3: 2017-10-06\n        Day4: 2017-10-07\n\n   We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        dates = []\n        base_str = \"2017-10-04\"\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"{base_str} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                # but we need to increment the day? \n                # Actually, we are generating 4 days: 04,05,06,07\n                # We can do: \n                #   base_date = datetime(2017,10,4) + timedelta(days=day)\n                #   then format to string with hour.\n\n        But we are in a non-programming environment? We have to write the dates manually? \n\n        Alternatively, we can generate the dates by:\n\n            day0: 2017-10-04\n            day1: 2017-10-05\n            day2: 2017-10-06\n            day3: 2017-10-07\n\n        And for each day, we output 24 hours.\n\n        So:\n\n            for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n                day = (4 + day_offset)  # day of month\n                for hour in range(24):\n                    date_str = f\"2017-10-{4+day_offset:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n        But note: October has 31 days, so 4,5,6,7 are all in October.\n\n   However, we are to output 96 rows. We'll do:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            day = 4 + i // 24\n            hour = i % 24\n            date_str = f\"2017-10-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n        But note: when i=24, day becomes 4+1=5, which is correct.\n\n        However, when i=24: day=5, hour=0 -> 2017-10-05 00:00:00\n\n        i=95: day = 4 + 95//24 = 4 + 3 = 7, hour = 95 % 24 = 23 -> 2017-10-07 23:00:00\n\n        So that works.\n\n   We'll compute the mean for each hour:\n\n        We'll create an array `hour_means` of length 24.\n\n        How to compute:\n\n            hour_means[0] = ( -0.944 + (-0.822) + (-0.853) + (-1.005) ) / 4 = -3.624/4 = -0.906\n            hour_means[1] = ( -1.066 + (-0.883) + (-0.914) + (-1.036) ) /4 = (-1.066-0.883-0.914-1.036) = -3.899 -> -0.97475 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.975\n\n        We do a few:\n\n            hour_means[2] = ( -1.097 + (-0.883) + (-0.883) + (-1.036) ) /4 = (-1.097-0.883-0.883-1.036) = -3.899 -> -0.975\n            Actually: -1.097 -0.883 = -1.98, then -0.883 -> -2.863, then -1.036 -> -3.899 -> same as hour1? \n\n        Let me check the data:\n\n            Hour2: \n                2017-09-30 02:00:00 -1.097\n                2017-10-01 02:00:00 -0.883\n                2017-10-02 02:00:00 -0.883\n                2017-10-03 02:00:00 -1.036\n\n            So: -1.097 -0.883 -0.883 -1.036 = -3.899 -> -0.975\n\n        But wait, the data for 2017-10-01 02:00:00 is -0.883? and 2017-10-02 02:00:00 is -0.883? \n\n        So we'll compute each hour.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour_means = [0]*24\n        for h in range(24):\n            total = 0.0\n            count = 0\n            # We have 4 days, so we take the value at hour h of each day.\n            # The data is in order, so the first occurrence of hour h is at index h, then h+24, h+48, h+72)\n            for i in range(4):\n                index = h + i*24\n                total += data[index][1]   # the LULL value at that row\n            hour_means[h] = round(total / 4, 3)\n\n   But note: the data is given in order, so:\n\n        index0: 2017-09-30 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> h=0, i=0 -> index0\n        index1: 2017-09-30 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> h=1, i=0 -> index1\n        ... \n        index24: 2017-10-01 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> h=0, i=1 -> index24\n        index25: 2017-10-01 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> h=1, i=1 -> index25\n\n        So yes.\n\n   We have the data as a list of 96 rows. We can index by [h + i*24] for i in [0,1,2,3] and h in [0,23].\n\n   Then we generate the next 96 points.\n\n   Let's code it in Python-like pseudocode:\n\n        # Parse the input data into a list of values\n        # We are given the data as a string, but we have to extract the numbers.\n\n        Actually, we are given:\n\n            \"2017-09-30 00:00:00 -0.944\"\n            ...\n\n        We can split each line and take the last value.\n\n        But note: the problem says we are to output the next 96 points.

Since we are grouping by hour, we can use the mean of the same hour from the other days? \n\n        But then we are using the same method for the forecast, so we need to impute first.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            We have 3 values for hour4: \n                2017-09-30 04:00:00: -1.097\n                2017-10-01 04:00:00: -0.883\n                2017-10-02 04:00:00: -0.944\n\n            We are missing 2017-10-03 04:00:00.\n\n            We can impute by the mean of these three? \n\n            mean = (-1.097 -0.883 -0.944)/3 = -2.924/3 = -0.9747 -> -0.975\n\n        Then we add this imputed value for 2017-10-03 04:00:00.\n\n        Then we have 4 values for hour4.\n\n   So we will:\n\n        Step 1: Check for missing hours in the historical data and impute by the mean of the same hour from the other available days.\n\n        But note: we only have 4 days, and one is missing. We can do:\n\n            For each hour in 0..23:\n                values = []\n                for day in [0,1,2,3] (representing the 4 days):\n                    if the value for (day, hour) exists, then use it.\n                    else, skip for now.\n                if we have less than 4 values, then for the missing ones, we impute by the mean of the available ones? \n                But then we use the imputed value to compute the overall mean? \n\n            Alternatively, we can impute the missing value first and then compute the mean.\n\n        We know only hour4 of day3 (2017-10-03) is missing.\n\n        We'll impute it as described.\n\n        Then we compute the mean for each hour using the 4 values (with one imputed).\n\n   So for hour4:\n\n        values = [-1.097, -0.883, -0.944, -0.975]   # the last one is imputed.\n        mean = (-1.097-0.883-0.944-0.975)/4 = -3.899/4 = -0.975\n\n   But note: the imputed value is the mean of the other three, so the overall mean will be the same as the mean of the three? \n\n        Let me: \n            mean_of_three = (-1.097-0.883-0.944)/3 = -2.924/3 = -0.974666... -> rounded to -0.975\n            then the fourth value is -0.975, so the overall mean = (-2.924 -0.975)/4 = -3.899/4 = -0.97475 -> rounded to -0.975\n\n        So it is the same.\n\n   Therefore, for hour4, we can simply use the mean of the available three.\n\n   In fact, for any hour that has missing values, we can use the mean of the available ones. And then when we forecast, we use that mean.\n\n   But note: we are not asked to fill the historical data, only to forecast. But to compute the mean for forecasting, we need to fill the missing value in the historical data for the purpose of computing the mean.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        For hour in 0..23:\n            values = []\n            for day in range(4):\n                index = hour + day*24\n                if index is within the provided data and the row exists, then use the value.\n            But in our case, we know the only missing is at day3, hour4.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if hour==4:\n                available_values = [ value at (day0, hour4), (day1, hour4), (day2, hour4) ]\n                imputed_value = mean(available_values)\n                values = available_values + [imputed_value]\n            else:\n                values = [ value for each day ]\n\n        Then compute the mean for that hour.\n\n   But note: we don't know which hours are missing. The problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but only one is missing? \n\n   We have to check the entire 96 points for missing hours.\n\n   How? \n\n        The data should be in hourly intervals.
