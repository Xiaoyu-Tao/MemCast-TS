        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 2. Since the data is time series with hourly frequency, we can consider using models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even machine learning models.\n    Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points ahead, we need a model that can handle multiple seasonality or patterns.\n\n 3. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be daily patterns (24-hour cycle). For example, on each day we see a similar pattern: \n        * Lower values during the night and higher during the day? But looking at the data, the pattern is not very clear and there are fluctuations.\n\n 4. We'll use a model that can capture seasonality. Since we have hourly data and expect daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal ARIMA model.\n\n 5. However, note that we are only given 4 days of data (96 hours). This is a very short time series for fitting a seasonal model with 24 periods. \n    Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal model or a simpler model.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we might use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, but with only 4 days, the seasonality might not be well captured.\n\n 7. Another approach: use a simple moving average or naive methods? But we need 96 steps ahead, so we need a model that can project forward.\n\n 8. We can use an ARIMA model without seasonality, or with seasonality but with a very short history. We'll try to automatically select the parameters.\n\n 9. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values, so we can proceed.\n\n 10. We are to forecast 96 points. We'll use the following steps in code (but note: we are to output the forecast, not the code).\n\n 11. Since we cannot run code in this environment, we have to simulate the process. But we are expected to provide the forecast.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n      - We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that for the next 4 days (96 hours) as the forecast.\n\n 13. Steps for the simple method:\n      a. Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n      b. Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we use the mean of each hour for the corresponding hour of the dates: 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00.\n\n 14. But note: the data might have a strong daily pattern? Let's check the data for the same hour across days:\n\n Example for hour 0: \n      Day1: 3.020\n      Day2: 3.411\n      Day3: 3.660\n      Day4: 3.020\n      Average = (3.020+3.411+3.660+3.020)/4 = 3.27775\n\n Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n 15. However, we see that the data does not have a consistent pattern? For example, hour 1:\n      Day1: 2.061\n      Day2: 3.056\n      Day3: 3.056\n      Day4: 3.234\n      Average = (2.061+3.056+3.056+3.234)/4 = 2.85175\n\n 16. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. But note: the data might have a trend? We have only 4 days, so it's hard to tell. We can detrend? \n     However, we are not given enough data to see a trend. So we assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 18. Steps:\n      - Create an array of 24 values, each being the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign:\n          Day5 (2016-10-01): hour0 to hour23: the 24 averages in order.\n          Day6 (2016-10-02): same 24 averages.\n          Day7 (2016-10-03): same.\n          Day8 (2016-10-04): same.\n\n 19. However, note that the last day in the data is 2016-09-30, so the next day is 2016-10-01.\n\n 20. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 21. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      Hour0: (3.020 + 3.411 + 3.660 + 3.020) / 4 = 3.27775\n      Hour1: (2.061 + 3.056 + 3.056 + 3.234) / 4 = 2.85175\n      Hour2: (2.416 + 3.234 + 2.985 + 2.594) / 4 = 2.80725\n      Hour3: (2.025 + 2.310 + 3.980 + 2.878) / 4 = 2.79825\n      Hour4: (4.264 + 3.234 + 3.127 + 2.772) / 4 = 3.34925\n      Hour5: (2.274 + 3.411 + 1.137 + 2.203) / 4 = 2.25625\n      Hour6: (1.883 + 2.630 + 1.137 + 2.487) / 4 = 2.03425\n      Hour7: (3.092 + 3.056 + 1.421 + 1.954) / 4 = 2.38075\n      Hour8: (2.985 + 3.767 + 1.706 + 2.025) / 4 = 2.62075\n      Hour9: (1.350 + 3.234 + 1.066 + 2.701) / 4 = 2.08775\n      Hour10: (3.056 + 2.665 + 0.675 + 2.949) / 4 = 2.33625\n      Hour11: (2.274 + 3.198 + 0.924 + 2.274) / 4 = 2.1675\n      Hour12: (1.599 + 2.132 + 1.315 + 2.239) / 4 = 1.82125\n      Hour13: (2.310 + 1.990 + 1.635 + 3.163) / 4 = 2.2745\n      Hour14: (2.487 + 1.812 + 0.995 + 3.340) / 4 = 2.1585\n      Hour15: (2.949 + 2.345 + 1.279 + 2.878) / 4 = 2.36275\n      Hour16: (2.772 + 2.025 + 1.279 + 2.132) / 4 = 2.052\n      Hour17: (2.274 + 1.954 + 1.066 + 2.203) / 4 = 1.87425\n      Hour18: (1.990 + 1.031 + 2.025 + 1.599) / 4 = 1.66125\n      Hour19: (1.812 + 0.746 + 1.386 + 1.599) / 4 = 1.38575\n      Hour20: (2.097 + 0.640 + 1.244 + 1.279) / 4 = 1.315\n      Hour21: (1.883 + 0.924 + 1.279 + 1.102) / 4 = 1.297\n      Hour22: (3.198 + 1.635 + 2.168 + 1.812) / 4 = 2.20325\n      Hour23: (2.025 + 2.914 + 2.239 + 1.990) / 4 = 2.292\n\n 22. Now, we round to 3 decimal places as in the original data? The original data has 3 decimals.\n\n 23. So the hourly averages (rounded to 3 decimals) for the 24 hours:\n\n      Hour0: 3.278\n      Hour1: 2.852\n      Hour2: 2.807\n      Hour3: 2.798\n      Hour4: 3.349\n      Hour5: 2.256\n      Hour6: 2.034\n      Hour7: 2.381\n      Hour8: 2.621\n      Hour9: 2.088\n      Hour10: 2.336\n      Hour11: 2.168\n      Hour12: 1.821\n      Hour13: 2.275\n      Hour14: 2.159\n      Hour15: 2.363\n      Hour16: 2.052\n      Hour17: 1.874\n      Hour18: 1.661\n      Hour19: 1.386\n      Hour20: 1.315\n      Hour21: 1.297\n      Hour22: 2.203\n      Hour23: 2.292\n\n 24. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-01 00:00:00 (which is hour0 of day1) -> 3.278\n      Then 2016-10-01 01:00:00 -> 2.852\n      ... until 2016-10-01 23:00:00 -> 2.292\n\n      Then 2016-10-02 00:00:00 -> 3.278\n      ... and so on.\n\n 25. We generate 4 days (96 hours) of data.\n\n 26. But note: the original data might have a trend or other patterns that we are ignoring. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture more.\n\n 27. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 28. The dates: \n      The last date in the input is 2016-09-30 23:00:00.\n      The next date is 2016-10-01 00:00:00, then 2016-10-01 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-10-04 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We must format the dates exactly as in the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 30. We'll write the forecast in the same format.\n\n 31. The answer must be in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-01 00:00:00 3.278\n2016-10-01 01:00:00 2.852\n... \n2016-10-04 23:00:00 2.292\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 32. However, note that the original data had 3 decimal places. We rounded the averages to 3 decimals.\n\n 33. But wait: the original data had some variation. This method is very simple and might not capture the dynamics. \n     However, without a sophisticated model and given the short history, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 34. We'll proceed.\n\n 35. Let's list the dates and the corresponding hour of day:\n\n      For 2016-10-01: \n          00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 3.278\n          01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 2.852\n          02:00:00 -> hour2 -> 2.807\n          03:00:00 -> hour3 -> 2.798\n          04:00:00 -> hour4 -> 3.349\n          05:00:00 -> hour5 -> 2.256\n          06:00:00 -> hour6 -> 2.034\n          07:00:00 -> hour7 -> 2.381\n          08:00:00 -> hour8 -> 2.621\n          09:00:00 -> hour9 -> 2.088\n          10:00:00 -> hour10 -> 2.336\n          11:00:00 -> hour11 -> 2.168\n          12:00:00 -> hour12 -> 1.821\n          13:00:00 -> hour13 -> 2.275\n          14:00:00 -> hour14 -> 2.159\n          15:00:00 -> hour15 -> 2.363\n          16:00:00 -> hour16 -> 2.052\n          17:00:00 -> hour17 -> 1.874\n          18:00:00 -> hour18 -> 1.661\n          19:00:00 -> hour19 -> 1.386\n          20:00:00 -> hour20 -> 1.315\n          21:00:00 -> hour21 -> 1.297\n          22:00:00 -> hour22 -> 2.203\n          23:00:00 -> hour23 -> 2.292\n\n      Then repeat the same for 2016-10-02, 2016-10-03, 2016-10-04.\n\n 36. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 37. But note: the original data had a drop on the last day? We are not capturing that because we are averaging.\n\n 38. However, we are to provide a forecast. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 39. We output the data.\n\n 40. Note: The problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. \n     We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n 41. We'll generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 42. Let's write the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-01 00:00:00\n      End:   2016-10-04 23:00:00\n\n 43. We generate 96 lines.\n\n 44. We must be cautious: the original data had 96 points? Yes, 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 45. We are to output 96 forecasted points.\n\n 46.
