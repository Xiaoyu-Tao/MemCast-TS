        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 time points (i.e., from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 onwards for 96 hours).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency. The last timestamp is 2016-11-29 23:00:00.\n 2. We must forecast the next 96 hours, so the forecast period is from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00 (since 96 hours = 4 days).\n 3. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. \n    However, for forecasting, we will assume the given data is complete for modeling. If there were missing values, we would have to impute them, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is a multi-step forecast) and the data is hourly, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast without missing values, we can use:\n   - SARIMA: seasonal ARIMA, because we might have daily seasonality (24 hours). However, with only 4 days of data, it's hard to capture weekly patterns, but daily (24 period) might be present.\n\n Steps for modeling:\n  1. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n  2. If non-stationary, we may need to difference (including seasonal differencing).\n  3. Identify the orders (p,d,q) and seasonal orders (P,D,Q,s) for SARIMA.\n\n However, note: we only have 96 points (4 days). This is a very short time series for fitting a SARIMA model with daily seasonality (s=24) because we only have 4 seasons.\n\n Alternative: \n  - We can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) that can handle seasonality, but again with only 4 days, it might not be reliable.\n  - Another alternative is to use a machine learning model, but with only 96 points, it's challenging.\n\n Given the constraints, we might consider:\n  - Using a model that can capture daily patterns by aggregating the data by hour of the day? But we have only 4 days, so we can try to compute the average pattern for each hour and then adjust with a trend.\n\n However, the problem says the data has missing values in general, but the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n Since the data is very short, we can try to use a naive seasonal method:\n   - The naive seasonal forecast would be to use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it 4 times? But we see that the pattern is changing.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with a trend and seasonality.\n\n After reviewing the data, we see:\n   - There is a clear daily pattern: temperatures are lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Also, there seems to be an increasing trend from the first day to the second and third, but then it drops on the fourth.\n\n Due to the limited data, we can use a model that decomposes the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual.\n\n We can use:\n   - STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) for decomposition and then forecast the components.\n   - But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n Another idea: use a model that is designed for short series, such as Theta method or simple exponential smoothing with additive seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data has 4 days (96 points) and we want to forecast 4 days (96 points). This is a lot for such a short history.\n\n Given the challenge, we will use a simple approach:\n\n  1. We will average the same hour across the 4 days to get a daily profile.\n  2. Then, we will adjust the profile by the last day's overall level.\n\n But note: the last day (2016-11-29) has lower temperatures than the previous days? Let's see:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-11-26): min ~3.8, max ~12.7\n   Day 2 (2016-11-27): min ~12.6, max ~17.2\n   Day 3 (2016-11-28): min ~10.5, max ~16.3\n   Day 4 (2016-11-29): min ~9.2, max ~13.5\n\n There is a peak on day 2 and then a decline. Without more data, it's hard to say if there is a weekly pattern (we don't have a week of data) or if it's a trend.\n\n Since we are limited, we can do:\n\n   - Use the average of the last two days to form the daily profile? Or use the entire 4 days?\n\n Let me compute the hourly average for the 4 days:\n\n   hour00: [3.799, 12.592, 14.773, 10.482] -> average = (3.799+12.592+14.773+10.482)/4 = 10.4115\n   ... and so on.\n\n But then we note that the level of the last day (2016-11-29) is lower. So we can adjust the profile by the ratio of the last day's average to the overall average?\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and then adjust by the difference between consecutive days? \n\n However, the problem requires 96 points and we must provide the forecast.\n\n Considering the complexity and the fact that we don't have a lot of data, we will use a simple method:\n\n   We will use the average of the last two days (48 points) to form a daily profile (24 hours) and then repeat it 4 days? But we are to forecast 4 days.\n\n   But the last two days are 2016-11-28 and 2016-11-29. We can take the average for each hour of these two days to form a 24-hour profile.\n\n   Then, we will use that profile for the next 4 days? But note: the data shows a downward trend? So we might need to adjust the level.\n\n   We can compute the average of the last 24 hours (day 4) and the average of the previous 24 hours (day 3) and then compute a trend.\n\n   Let:\n        day3_avg = average of 2016-11-28 (from 00:00 to 23:00) -> 14.773, 14.773, ... until 11.185 -> let's calculate:\n            day3: 14.773,14.773,13.366,13.296,14.632,13.999,14.984,12.944,12.311,11.326,11.607,12.240,13.296,16.320,15.195,14.491,15.054,16.250,14.703,13.225,12.240,11.115,11.256,11.185\n            average_day3 = sum(above)/24 = 13.65 (approx)\n\n        day4_avg = average of 2016-11-29: \n            [10.482,10.271,9.919,10.341,9.567,10.060,9.215,9.075,9.286,9.356,9.497,9.708,10.482,10.833,11.185,11.256,11.256,13.014,12.803,12.311,12.100,12.944,13.507,13.296]\n            average_day4 = 10.94 (approx)\n\n        The change from day3 to day4: 10.94 - 13.65 = -2.71\n\n        We can assume a linear trend? Then for the next 4 days, we might continue the trend? But that would lead to negative temperatures? which is not likely.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days to form the profile and then adjust the level of each day by a moving average of the last few days? \n\n   However, we only have 4 days. We can use the average of the last 4 days as the base and then use the daily profile.\n\n   Given the time, we decide:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average daily profile for the entire 4 days (average for each hour of the day).\n\n        Step 2: We note that the overall level of the series has been changing. We can compute the daily average for each day and then forecast the daily average for the next 4 days using a simple method (like linear regression or even naive).\n\n        Step 3: Then, for each day in the forecast, we take the daily profile and multiply by (forecasted_daily_avg / overall_avg) or add the difference? \n\n        But note: the profile is additive? Let's see the variation: the temperature has a daily cycle. We can do additive adjustment.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            Let H_i be the hourly profile for hour i (i from 0 to 23) computed as the average of that hour over 4 days.\n\n            Let A = overall average of the entire 96 points.\n\n            Then for a given day, if we forecast the daily average for that day to be F, then the forecast for hour i in that day would be: \n                H_i + (F - A)\n\n        But we need to forecast F for the next 4 days.\n\n        How to forecast the daily averages for the next 4 days?\n\n            We have 4 daily averages: \n                day1_avg = (first 24 points average) -> 8.99\n                day2_avg = (next 24) -> 13.99\n                day3_avg = 13.65\n                day4_avg = 10.94\n\n            We can use a simple moving average? Or linear regression? \n\n            The series of daily averages: [8.99, 13.99, 13.65, 10.94] -> It went up and then down. We can use the average of the last two: (13.65+10.94)/2 = 12.295 for the next day? and then for the next days we can use the same? But that would be constant.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing: \n                F5 = alpha * last + (1-alpha) * ... but we have only 4 points.\n\n        Given the volatility, we don't have a clear trend, we might use the average of the entire 4 days: (8.99+13.99+13.65+10.94)/4 = 11.89.\n\n        Then we set each of the next 4 days to 11.89? \n\n        Then the forecast for each hour i in any of the next 4 days would be: \n            H_i + (11.89 - A)\n\n        But note: A is the overall average of the 96 points. Let's compute A: \n            We have the entire data, so we can compute the mean of the 96 OT values.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the daily average for the next 4 days to the average of the last 4 days (11.89) and then use the profile.\n\n        However, we see that the last day was 10.94, so 11.89 is higher. We might use the average of the last two days: (13.65+10.94)/2 = 12.295? \n\n        But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we can use:\n\n            Day5: 12.295\n            Day6: 12.295? or we can use a weighted average? \n\n        Since we don't have a clear trend, we will use the average of the last two days (12.295) for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        But then we are ignoring the drop? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day's average (10.94) and then assume it will be the same? \n\n        However, the problem does not give us more information. We must make a choice.\n\n        Let's choose to use the average of the last two days (12.295) for the next 4 days.\n\n        Step 4: Compute the overall average A of the entire 96 points.\n\n        Step 5: Compute the hourly profile H_i (for i in 0..23) as the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Step 6: For each day in the forecast (4 days) and for each hour i, the forecast = H_i + (12.295 - A)\n\n        But note: this additive adjustment might not be the best if the daily profile is multiplicative. However, we don't have enough data to check.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do multiplicative: \n            forecast = H_i * (12.295 / A)\n\n        But additive is more common for temperatures? \n\n        Let me check: the daily profile has a range of about 10 degrees. The level change is about 2-3 degrees. So additive might be okay.\n\n        We'll do additive.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the overall average A of the 96 points.\n\n   Step 2: Group by hour (i.e., the hour of the day: 0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for each hour -> H_i.\n\n   Step 3: Compute the daily average for the last two days: \n        day3_avg = 13.65 (we calculated approximately, but we should use exact)\n        day4_avg = 10.94\n        avg_last2 = (13.65+10.94)/2 = 12.295\n\n   Step 4: For the next 4 days (96 hours), for each hour i (0 to 23) in each day, the forecast = H_i + (12.295 - A)\n\n   But note: we are adding the same adjustment for every hour. This will shift the entire profile.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the overall average A is the entire 96 points. The daily profile H_i is the average of 4 days. The average of H_i over 24 hours should be the same as the overall average A?\n\n        Because: \n            A = (sum of all 96 points)/96\n            H_i = (sum of points at hour i over 4 days)/4\n            Then the average of H_i (over i=0..23) = (sum of all 96 points)/96 = A.\n\n        So if we do: H_i + (12.295 - A), then the average of the forecasted day would be:\n            (sum_i [H_i + (12.295 - A)]) / 24 = A + (12.295 - A) = 12.295.\n\n        So we are setting the daily average to 12.295.\n\n   Step 5: Generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-11-30 00:00:00.\n\n   Let's do the exact calculation.\n\n   First, we compute the exact overall average A and the 96 points:\n\n        We have the data, so we can sum them and divide by 96.\n\n   Then, we compute the hourly profile H_i for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the 4 values for that hour.\n\n   Then, for each of the next 4 days (2016-11-30, 2016-12-01, 2016-12-02, 2016-12-03) and for each hour in the day, we compute:\n        forecast = H_i + (12.295 - A)\n\n   But note: we used 12.295 as the average for the next days, but we computed that from the last two days? We need the exact daily averages for day3 and day4.\n\n   Let me compute the exact daily averages:\n\n        Day3 (2016-11-28): \n            data from index 48 to 71 (0-indexed: 48,49,...,71) -> 24 points.\n            sum_day3 = 14.773+14.773+13.366+13.296+14.632+13.999+14.984+12.944+12.311+11.326+11.607+12.240+13.296+16.320999+15.195+14.491+15.054+16.250+14.703+13.225+12.240+11.115+11.256+11.185\n            = 327.602999\n            avg_day3 = 327.602999 / 24 = 13.650124958333334\n\n        Day4 (2016-11-29):\n            data from index 72 to 95: \n            [10.482,10.271,9.919,10.341,9.567,10.060,9.215,9.075,9.286,9.356,9.497,9.708,10.482,10.833,11.185,11.256,11.256,13.014,12.803,12.311,12.100,12.944,13.507,13.296]\n            sum_day4 = 10.482+10.271+9.919+10.341+9.567+10.060+9.215+9.075+9.286+9.356+9.497+9.708+10.482+10.833+11.185+11.256+11.256+13.014+12.803+12.311+12.100+12.944+13.507+13.296\n            = 262.503\n            avg_day4 = 262.503 / 24 = 10.937625\n\n        Then avg_last2 = (13.650124958333334 + 10.937625) / 2 = 12.293874979166667\n\n   Now, compute the overall average A for the entire 96 points:\n\n        We have the entire data.

But with only 4 days, we cannot capture the evolution of the profile.\n\n   This is a simple method that might be acceptable given the data limitations.\n\n   Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-30 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-11-30 01:00:00, ... until 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 96 points.\n\n   We'll compute:\n\n        For day_offset in [0,1,2,3] (for the 4 days)\n          For hour_offset in [0,1,...,23] (for the 24 hours)\n             date = 2016-11-30 + day_offset days, and then set the time to hour_offset:00:00\n             value = H_hour_offset + 0.401833322916667\n\n   But note: the adjustment is the same for every hour and every day.\n\n   We must compute H_i for i=0..23.\n\n   Let me compute H_i:\n\n        We have the data in 4x24 matrix.\n\n        We can do:\n\n        hour0: (3.799 + 12.592 + 14.773 + 10.482) / 4 = 10.4115\n        hour1: (4.502 + 12.803 + 14.773 + 10.271) / 4 = 10.58725\n        hour2: (4.362 + 12.733 + 13.366 + 9.919) / 4 = 10.095\n        hour3: (4.995 + 12.029 + 13.296 + 10.341) / 4 = 10.16525\n        hour4: (4.291 + 12.100 + 14.632 + 9.567) / 4 = 10.1475\n        hour5: (2.603 + 11.044 + 13.999 + 10.060) / 4 = 9.4265\n        hour6: (6.331 + 12.733 + 14.984 + 9.215) / 4 = 10.81575\n        hour7: (7.457 + 11.748 + 12.944 + 9.075) / 4 = 10.306\n        hour8: (7.597 + 12.803 + 12.311 + 9.286) / 4 = 10.49925\n        hour9: (7.668 + 11.818 + 11.326 + 9.356) / 4 = 10.042\n        hour10: (7.246 + 10.974 + 11.607 + 9.497) / 4 = 9.831\n        hour11: (8.723 + 13.436 + 12.240 + 9.708) / 4 = 11.02675\n        hour12: (9.145 + 12.733 + 13.296 + 10.482) / 4 = 11.414\n        hour13: (10.904 + 16.743 + 16.320999 + 10.833) / 4 = 13.70024975\n        hour14: (12.733 + 16.882999 + 15.195 + 11.185) / 4 = 13.99899975\n        hour15: (11.115 + 16.250 + 14.491 + 11.256) / 4 = 13.278\n        hour16: (11.185 + 16.532 + 15.054 + 11.256) / 4 = 13.50675\n        hour17: (12.662 + 17.165001 + 16.250 + 13.014) / 4 = 14.77275025\n        hour18: (12.592 + 15.125 + 14.703 + 12.803) / 4 = 13.80575\n        hour19: (12.240 + 14.632 + 13.225 + 12.311) / 4 = 13.102\n        hour20: (12.170 + 13.788 + 12.240 + 12.100) / 4 = 12.5745\n        hour21: (11.185 + 13.436 + 11.115 + 12.944) / 4 = 12.170\n        hour22: (12.029 + 14.984 + 11.256 + 13.507) / 4 = 12.944\n        hour23: (13.014 + 15.054 + 11.185 + 13.296) / 4 = 13.13725\n\n   Then for each hour in the forecast, we add 0.401833322916667 to the above H_i.\n\n   Example: \n        hour0: 10.4115 + 0.401833322916667 = 10.813333322916667\n        hour1: 10.58725 + 0.401833322916667 = 10.989083322916667\n\n   We do this for 4 days? Actually, we do for 4 days, each day having 24 hours.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-30\n        Day2: 2016-12-01\n        Day3: 2016-12-02\n        Day4: 2016-12-03\n\n   We must be careful: November has 30 days, so 2016-11-30 is the next day after 2016-11-29.\n\n   Then 2016-12-01, 2016-12-02, 2016-12-03.\n\n   We write the forecast for 96 hours.\n\n   We output in the same format: two columns: date and OT.\n\n   We must output 96 points.\n\n   We'll format the numbers to 6 decimal places as in the input? The input had 3, but we can do 6 and then round to 3? \n\n   The input had 3 decimal places, but we can output with 6 and then the user can round? \n\n   We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the input had up to 6 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places, but some had 6? \n\n   Example: 16.882999 -> 6 decimal places? \n\n   We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n   Let's code the forecast:\n\n        We have H = [10.4115, 10.58725, 10.095, 10.16525, 10.1475, 9.4265, 10.81575, 10.306, 10.49925, 10.042, 9.831, 11.02675, 11.414, 13.70024975, 13.99899975, 13.278, 13.50675, 14.77275025, 13.80575, 13.102, 12.5745, 12.170, 12.944, 13.13725]\n\n        adjustment = 0.401833322916667\n\n        Then for each day in 0 to 3:\n            for hour in 0 to 23:\n                value = H[hour] + adjustment\n\n        And the date: \n            base_date = datetime(2016, 11, 30) + timedelta(days=day)\n            then set hour = hour\n\n   We'll generate the data.\n\n   But note: the input had the date as string in the format: \"2016-11-26 00:00:00\"\n\n   We'll output the same.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n   We are not handling any missing values in the forecast because we are generating the next 96 points without gaps.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,OT\n        2016-11-30 00:00:00,10.813333\n        2016-11-30 01:00:00,10.989083\n        ... \n        2016-12-03 23:00:00,13.539083\n\n   But note: we must be precise. We computed the adjustment and the H_i with more decimals, so we should output to 6 decimal places.\n\n   However, the input had mixed: some with 3, some with 6? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places for most, but some had 6? \n\n   Example: 16.882999 -> that's 6. So we output 6.\n\n   We'll round to 6 decimal places? \n\n   We can do: \n        formatted_value = round(H_i + adjustment, 6)\n\n   But note: we are using the exact computed value.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use formatting to 6 decimal places.\n\n   We'll do: \n        \"{:.6f}\".format(value)\n\n   But note: the input had trailing zeros? We can output with 6 decimal places.\n\n   We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n   Let's do it.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 30, 11) -> wait, 2016-11-30\n\n        Actually, the last date in the input is 2016-11-29 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-11-30 00:00:00.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            base = datetime(2016, 11, 30) -> no, November is 11, and day is 30.\n\n        Correction: \n            base = datetime(2016, 11, 30, 0, 0, 0)\n\n        Then for i in range(96):\n            date = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n        Then we can assign the value: \n            hour_of_day = date.hour\n            value = H[hour_of_day] + adjustment\n\n        But note: we have H for hour0 to hour23.\n\n        So for the first date: 2016-11-30 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> H[0] + adjustment\n\n        Then 2016-11-30 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> H[1] + adjustment\n\n        ... until 2016-11-30 23:00:00 -> hour23 -> H[23] + adjustment\n\n        Then 2016-12-01 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> H[0] + adjustment\n\n        and so on.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        H = [10.4115, 10.58725, 10.095, 10.16525, 10.1475, 9.4265, 10.81575, 10.306, 10.49925, 10.042, 9.831, 11.02675, 11.414, 13.70024975, 13.99899975, 13.278, 13.50675, 14.77275025, 13.80575, 13.102, 12.5745, 12.170, 12.944, 13.13725]\n\n        adjustment = 0.401833322916667\n\n        Then for i in range(96):\n            hour_index = i % 24\n            value = H[hour_index] + adjustment\n            # format the value to 6 decimal places\n\n   We'll generate the dates as:\n\n        base = datetime(2016, 11, 30, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n            hour_index = i % 24\n            value = H[hour_index] + adjustment\n            # then format current_date as string: \n            date_str = current_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n   Then output: date_str, value\n\n   We'll write 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the input had the date as index?

We used the exact numbers? \n\n   We computed the sums for day3 and day4 exactly, and the overall sum exactly? \n\n   But for H_i we used the data as given? \n\n   We'll use the exact H_i as computed above.\n\n   But note: the H_i for hour13: 13.70024975 -> we used that.\n\n   We'll compute the value for each hour_index and then round to 6 decimal places? \n\n   Actually, we'll format to 6 decimal places without rounding? \n\n   We can do: \n        value = H[hour_index] + adjustment\n        formatted_value = format(value, '.6f')\n\n   But note: Python might show more digits? We can use formatting.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use: \n        \"{:.6f}\".format(value)\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Let's code the answer.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.

Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2016-11-26 00:00:00  3.799000\"\n\n   It had two spaces? Actually, in the example it was:\n\n        \"2016-11-26 00:00:00  3.799000\"\n\n   But in the data you provided, it was a tab? or multiple spaces? \n\n   We'll use a comma? The problem did not specify the separator. But the example output format in the problem was:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   And the example input had:\n\n        \"2016-11-26 00:00:00  3.799000\"\n\n   with a space. But to be safe, we can use the same: two spaces? \n\n   Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2016-11-26 00:00:00  3.799000\" -> that's two spaces? \n\n   We'll use two spaces.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        \"2016-11-30 00:00:00  {:.6f}\".format(value)\n\n   But note: the input had 6 decimal places? 3.799000 -> 6 decimal places.\n\n   So we output 6 decimal places.\n\n   We'll generate the data.\n\n   We'll do the calculation for the 96 points.\n\n   We'll write the answer.\n\n   However, note: the adjustment is 0.401833322916667, and we are using the H_i as above.\n\n   We'll compute the values.\n\n   We'll do it step by step.\n\n   We'll create a list of the H_i (hourly profile) and then for each of the 96 hours, we compute the value.\n\n   We'll write the code in Python-like pseudocode and then output the table.\n\n   But note: we are to output the answer in the box.\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        base_date = datetime.datetime(2016, 11, 30, 0, 0, 0)\n        H = [10.4115, 10.58725, 10.095, 10.16525, 10.1475, 9.4265, 10.81575, 10.306, 10.49925, 10.042, 9.831, 11.02675, 11.414, 13.70024975, 13.99899975, 13.278, 13.50675, 14.77275025, 13.80575, 13.102, 12.5745, 12.170, 12.944, 13.13725]\n        adj = 0.401833322916667\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            hour_index = i % 24\n            value = H[hour_index] + adj\n            # Format the value to string with 6 decimal places\n            value_str = \"{:.6f}\".format(value)\n            # Format the date as string: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n            date_str = current_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            print(f\"{date_str}  {value_str}\")\n\n   We'll do this and output the 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the adjustment is the same for every point.\n\n   We'll compute the values and output.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the H_i we computed are from the 4 days, and we used the exact numbers? \n\n   We did the sums by hand?
