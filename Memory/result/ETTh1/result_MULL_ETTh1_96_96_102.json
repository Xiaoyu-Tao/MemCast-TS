        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, in the provided sample, there are no missing values. So we proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows potential daily seasonality (24 hours in a day), we can consider a seasonal model.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the need for a forecast, we can use a model that handles seasonality. One common approach is to use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has only 96 points (4 days) which is very limited for training a model with daily seasonality (24 periods). We must be cautious.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple method such as:\n    - Using the average of the same hour in the past days (if we assume daily seasonality) to forecast the next day.\n    - But we have only 4 days of data, so we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a 24-hour profile and then use that to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the profile 4 times.\n\n 6. However, let's check the data has a clear daily pattern? Looking at the data:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-08-13): \n        starts at 0.746, then goes down to negative, then at 12:00 -2.310, then becomes more negative until 21:00 (-2.701) and recovers to -0.711 at 23:00.\n\n    Day 2 (2017-08-14): \n        starts at 0.320, then 0.426, ... then becomes negative and again becomes very negative in the afternoon/evening.\n\n    Day 3 (2017-08-15): \n        starts at 0.178, then negative, then at 12:00 0.071, then 14:00 2.843, then becomes negative again.\n\n    Day 4 (2017-08-16): \n        starts at 1.279, then decreases, then at 12:00 -1.315, then 14:00 1.031, then becomes negative again in the evening.\n\n    The pattern is not very consistent. Therefore, a simple average might not be the best.\n\n 7. Given the limited data, we might use a model that can capture both trend and seasonality. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a weekly pattern.\n\n 8. We can try to use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the requirement is for 96 points and we must provide the forecast.\n\n 9. Considering the constraints, we will use the following approach:\n\n    We will use the time series and decompose it into trend, seasonal, and residual. But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be estimated as the average of each hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Steps for decomposition:\n\n    a. Extract the hour-of-day from the timestamp.\n    b. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days. This will be our seasonal component for the 24 hours.\n    c. The trend is hard to estimate with 4 days, so we can assume a constant trend (the overall mean) or a linear trend? But the data is short. Alternatively, we can use the seasonal component and assume the trend is the same as the last day? \n\n    However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can use the provided data as is.\n\n 10. We decide to use the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile. Then we will use that daily profile for the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall mean per day:\n\n        Day 1: mean = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        Day 2: similarly\n        Day 3: \n        Day 4:\n\n    We can adjust the daily profile by the daily mean? But we don't have a forecast for the daily mean of the next 4 days.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last day's daily mean as the base and then add the seasonal component? Or we can use the average of the daily means? \n\n    However, we are not sure of the trend. Since we have only 4 days, we can assume the daily mean is constant? \n\n    Let me compute the daily means:\n\n        Day 1: \n            values: [0.746, -0.249, 0.284, 0.178, -0.213, 0.355, -0.853, 0.426, 0.178, -0.640, -0.391, -0.142, -2.310, -0.569, -0.391, -1.599, -1.599, -1.954, -1.954, -2.097, -2.061, -2.701, -1.315, -0.711]\n            mean = -0.799\n\n        Day 2: \n            [0.320, 0.426, -0.036, 0.995, 0.640, 0.355, -0.213, -0.284, 0.036, -0.959, -0.817, -1.492, -1.670, -1.386, -1.457, -1.315, -2.025, -2.203, -2.665, -3.305, -2.914, -2.203, -1.599, -1.706]\n            mean = -1.025\n\n        Day 3:\n            [0.178, -0.320, -0.107, -0.426, -0.426, -1.528, -1.528, -0.426, 0.000, -1.350, -0.249, 1.635, 0.071, 0.213, 2.843, -1.173, -1.670, -1.386, -1.457, -1.741, -1.564, -2.097, -0.888, 0.888]\n            mean = -0.333\n\n        Day 4:\n            [1.279, 1.208, 0.711, 0.569, 0.284, 0.284, -0.426, 0.036, -2.203, -0.604, -0.640, -0.675, -1.315, -1.031, 1.031, 1.244, 0.497, -0.036, -1.244, -2.097, -1.528, 0.355, -0.426, 0.711]\n            mean = -0.026\n\n    The daily means are: -0.799, -1.025, -0.333, -0.026 -> showing an increasing trend? But only 4 points.\n\n 12. We can use a linear regression on the daily means to forecast the next 4 days' daily means? \n\n    Let X = [1,2,3,4] for the four days, and y = [-0.799, -1.025, -0.333, -0.026]\n\n    Then we fit a linear model: y = a + b*x\n\n    We get:\n        b = (sum((x_i - x_mean)*(y_i - y_mean)) / sum((x_i - x_mean)^2)\n        a = y_mean - b * x_mean\n\n    x_mean = 2.5, y_mean = (-0.799 -1.025 -0.333 -0.026)/4 = -0.54575\n\n    numerator = (1-2.5)*(-0.799+0.54575) + (2-2.5)*(-1.025+0.54575) + (3-2.5)*(-0.333+0.54575) + (4-2.5)*(-0.026+0.54575)\n        = (-1.5)*(-0.25325) + (-0.5)*(-0.47925) + (0.5)*(0.21275) + (1.5)*(0.51975)\n        = 0.379875 + 0.239625 + 0.106375 + 0.779625\n        = 1.5055\n\n    denominator = (1-2.5)^2 + (2-2.5)^2 + (3-2.5)^2 + (4-2.5)^2\n        = 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5.0\n\n    b = 1.5055 / 5.0 = 0.3011\n    a = -0.54575 - 0.3011 * 2.5 = -0.54575 - 0.75275 = -1.2985\n\n    Then for day 5 (x=5): y5 = -1.2985 + 0.3011*5 = -1.2985 + 1.5055 = 0.207\n    day 6 (x=6): y6 = -1.2985 + 0.3011*6 = -1.2985 + 1.8066 = 0.5081\n    day 7 (x=7): y7 = -1.2985 + 0.3011*7 = -1.2985 + 2.1077 = 0.8092\n    day 8 (x=8): y8 = -1.2985 + 0.3011*8 = -1.2985 + 2.4088 = 1.1103\n\n    But note: the daily means are increasing, but the last day was -0.026 and then we jump to 0.207? That might be a big jump.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the average of the daily means for the next 4 days? Or use the last value? \n\n    Since the daily means are increasing, we can use the linear trend. But we have to be cautious because the data is very limited.\n\n 14. Now, we have the seasonal component (hourly profile) from the 4 days. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n    hour0: (0.746 + 0.320 + 0.178 + 1.279) / 4 = 2.523/4 = 0.63075\n    hour1: (-0.249 + 0.426 -0.320 + 1.208) /4 = 1.065/4 = 0.26625\n    ... and so on.\n\n 15. Then for the next 4 days, we will have:\n\n    Day 5 (2017-08-17): \n        For hour0: we take the seasonal component for hour0 and adjust by the daily mean of day5? \n        But note: the seasonal component we computed is the average of the original data. However, if we subtract the daily mean from each day's data to get the seasonal component, then we can add the forecasted daily mean.\n\n    How to get the seasonal component without the daily level?\n\n        We can compute: for each day, subtract the daily mean to get the seasonal deviation.\n\n        Then average the deviations for each hour.\n\n        Then for forecasting: \n            forecast for hour j in day i = forecasted_daily_mean_i + average_seasonal_deviation_j\n\n 16. Steps:\n\n    a. For each day i, compute the daily mean (m_i).\n    b. For each hour j in day i, compute: deviation_{i,j} = value_{i,j} - m_i.\n    c. For each hour j (0 to 23), compute the average deviation: d_j = (deviation_{1,j} + deviation_{4,j})/4.\n\n    d. Then for the next day (day5, i=5), the forecast for hour j is: forecasted_m5 + d_j.\n\n    Similarly for day6: forecasted_m6 + d_j, etc.\n\n 17. We already have the daily means for the 4 days and the linear regression for the next 4 days.\n\n    Let's compute the deviations for the 4 days and then the average deviations for each hour.\n\n 18. Implementation:\n\n    We'll create a matrix of deviations: 4 days x 24 hours.\n\n    Day1: m1 = -0.799\n        hour0: 0.746 - (-0.799) = 1.545\n        hour1: -0.249 - (-0.799) = 0.550\n        ... \n\n    Then we average each column (each hour) over the 4 days.\n\n 19. Then we forecast:\n\n        Day5: 2017-08-17 00:00:00: forecast = 0.207 + d0\n        Day5: 2017-08-17 01:00:00: forecast = 0.207 + d1\n        ... until 23:00\n\n        Day6: 2017-08-18 00:00:00: forecast = 0.5081 + d0\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. But note: the linear regression might be too simplistic? The daily means are not perfectly linear. We could also use the average of the last two days? Or use exponential smoothing? \n\n    However, we have to provide a forecast. We'll proceed with the linear trend for daily means and the fixed seasonal deviations.\n\n 21. Let's compute the average deviations for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a table for the 4 days and 24 hours.\n\n    Hour indices: 0 to 23.\n\n    Day1: m1 = -0.799\n    Day2: m2 = -1.025\n    Day3: m3 = -0.333\n    Day4: m4 = -0.026\n\n    For hour0:\n        d0 = [ (0.746 - (-0.799)), (0.320 - (-1.025)), (0.178 - (-0.333)), (1.279 - (-0.026)) ] \n            = [1.545, 1.345, 0.511, 1.305] \n        average = (1.545+1.345+0.511+1.305)/4 = 4.706/4 = 1.1765\n\n    For hour1:\n        d1 = [ (-0.249 - (-0.799)), (0.426 - (-1.025)), (-0.320 - (-0.333)), (1.208 - (-0.026)) ]\n            = [0.550, 1.451, 0.013, 1.234]\n        average = (0.550+1.451+0.013+1.234)/4 = 3.248/4 = 0.812\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 22. Then we forecast the next 4 days:\n\n    Day5 (2017-08-17): \n        m5 = 0.207\n        hour0: 0.207 + 1.1765 = 1.3835\n        hour1: 0.207 + 0.812 = 1.019\n        ...\n\n    Day6 (2017-08-18):\n        m6 = 0.5081\n        hour0: 0.5081 + 1.1765 = 1.6846\n        hour1: 0.5081 + 0.812 = 1.3201\n        ...\n\n    Day7 (2017-08-19):\n        m7 = 0.8092\n        hour0: 0.8092 + 1.1765 = 1.9857\n        ...\n\n    Day8 (2017-08-20):\n        m8 = 1.1103\n        hour0: 1.1103 + 1.1765 = 2.2868\n        ...\n\n 23. But note: the last day in the provided data is 2017-08-16. The next day is 2017-08-17, then 18, 19, 20).\n\n 24. We must generate 96 data points (4 days * 24 hours).\n\n 25. We have to compute the average deviations for all 24 hours. We'll do that programmatically.\n\n    However, we are doing this by hand? We are an AI, we can compute.\n\n    Let me write a small code in mind:\n\n        m = []\n        m.append(-0.799)   # day1\n        m.append(-1.025)   # day2\n        m.append(-0.333)   # day3\n        m.append(-0.026)   # day4\n\n        # The data in order (96 points) as given, in a list: data[0:24] = day1, 24:48=day2, 48:72=day3, 72:96=day4.\n\n        data = [0.746, -0.249, 0.284, 0.178, -0.213, 0.355, -0.853, 0.426, 0.178, -0.640, -0.391, -0.142, -2.310, -0.569, -0.391, -1.599, -1.599, -1.954, -1.954, -2.097, -2.061, -2.701, -1.315, -0.711,\n                0.320, 0.426, -0.036, 0.995, 0.640, 0.355, -0.213, -0.284, 0.036, -0.959, -0.817, -1.492, -1.670, -1.386, -1.457, -1.315, -2.025, -2.203, -2.665, -3.305, -2.914, -2.203, -1.599, -1.706,\n                0.178, -0.320, -0.107, -0.426, -0.426, -1.528, -1.528, -0.426, 0.000, -1.350, -0.249, 1.635, 0.071, 0.213, 2.843, -1.173, -1.670, -1.386, -1.457, -1.741, -1.564, -2.097, -0.888, 0.888,\n                1.279, 1.208, 0.711, 0.569, 0.284, 0.284, -0.426, 0.036, -2.203, -0.604, -0.640, -0.675, -1.315, -1.031, 1.031, 1.244, 0.497, -0.036, -1.244, -2.097, -1.528, 0.355, -0.426, 0.711]\n\n        deviations = []\n        for i in range(4):\n            for j in range(24):\n                idx = i*24+j\n                dev = data[idx] - m[i]\n                deviations.append(dev)\n\n        Then, for each hour j in [0,23]:\n            d_j = (deviations[j] + deviations[24+j] + deviations[48+j] + deviations[72+j]) / 4\n\n        Then we have d_j for j.\n\n 26. Then we compute:\n\n        m5 = 0.207\n        m6 = 0.5081\n        m7 = 0.8092\n        m8 = 1.1103\n\n        forecast for:\n            day5, hour0: m5 + d0\n            day5, hour1: m5 + d1\n            ... \n            day5, hour23: m5 + d23\n\n            day6, hour0: m6 + d0\n            ... \n\n 27. We generate the dates: starting from 2017-08-17 00:00:00, then 2017-08-17 01:00:00, ... until 2017-08-20 23:00:00.\n\n 28.

We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 35. Let's do the computation for the entire 96 forecasted points.\n\n    We'll create a list:\n\n        dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-08-17 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n        values = []\n\n        # For the first 24 hours (day5): use m5=0.207 and d0 to d23\n        # Next 24 (day6): m6=0.5081 and d0 to d23\n        # Then day7: m7=0.8092 and d0 to d23\n        # Then day8: m8=1.1103 and d0 to d23\n\n        d = [1.1765, 0.812, 0.75875, 0.87475, 0.617, 0.41225, -0.20925, 0.48375, 0.0485, -0.3425, 0.0215, 0.37725, -0.76025, -0.1475, 1.05225, -0.165, -0.6535, -0.849, -1.28425, -1.76425, -1.471, -1.11575, -0.51125, 0.34125]\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            m = [0.207, 0.5081, 0.8092, 1.1103][day]\n            for j in range(24):\n                value = m + d[j]\n                values.append(round(value, 3))\n\n 36. Then we output the dates and the values.\n\n 37. However, note: the linear regression might be too aggressive? The daily means are increasing by about 0.3 per day. But the last day was -0.026 and then we jump to 0.207? \n\n    But we have to stick to the method.\n\n 38. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 39. Let's write the forecasted data:\n\n        Day5 (2017-08-17) first 5 hours:\n\n            00:00: 0.207 + 1.1765 = 1.3835 -> 1.384\n            01:00: 0.207 + 0.812 = 1.019 -> 1.019\n            02:00: 0.207 + 0.75875 = 0.96575 -> 0.966\n            03:00: 0.207 + 0.87475 = 1.08175 -> 1.082\n            04:00: 0.207 + 0.617 = 0.824 -> 0.824\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 40. We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 41.

Then we pair with the dates.\n\n 43. The dates: \n\n        start = '2017-08-17 00:00:00'\n        then 96 hours: \n            day0: 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-17 23:00:00\n            day1: 2017-08-18 00:00:00 to 2017-08-18 23:00:00\n            day2: 2017-08-19 00:00:00 to 2017-08-19 23:00:00\n            day3: 2017-08-20 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00\n\n 44. We output:\n\n        date, MULL\n        2017-08-17 00:00:00, 1.384\n        2017-08-17 01:00:00, 1.019\n        ...\n\n 45. We must be cautious: the rounding. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. Let's do the entire day5 to check:\n\n        hour0: 0.207+1.1765=1.3835 -> 1.384\n        hour1: 0.207+0.812=1.019 -> 1.019\n        hour2: 0.207+0.75875=0.96575 -> 0.966\n        hour3: 0.207+0.87475=1.08175 -> 1.082\n        hour4: 0.207+0.617=0.824 -> 0.824\n        hour5: 0.207+0.41225=0.61925 -> 0.619\n        hour6: 0.207-0.20925=-0.00225 -> -0.002\n        hour7: 0.207+0.48375=0.69075 -> 0.691\n        hour8: 0.207+0.0485=0.2555 -> 0.256\n        hour9: 0.207-0.3425=-0.1355 -> -0.136\n        hour10: 0.207+0.0215=0.2285 -> 0.229\n        hour11: 0.207+0.37725=0.58425 -> 0.584\n        hour12: 0.207-0.76025=-0.55325 -> -0.553\n        hour13: 0.207-0.1475=0.0595 -> 0.060\n        hour14: 0.207+1.05225=1.25925 -> 1.259\n        hour15: 0.207-0.165=0.042 -> 0.042\n        hour16: 0.207-0.6535=-0.4465 -> -0.447\n        hour17: 0.207-0.849=-0.642 -> -0.642\n        hour18: 0.207-1.28425=-1.07725 -> -1.077\n        hour19: 0.207-1.76425=-1.55725 -> -1.557\n        hour20: 0.207-1.471=-1.264 -> -1.264\n        hour21: 0.207-1.11575=-0.90875 -> -0.909\n        hour22: 0.207-0.51125=-0.30425 -> -0.304\n        hour23: 0.207+0.34125=0.54825 -> 0.548\n\n 47. Now we write the answer.\n\n 48. We note: the method is simple and might not be the most accurate, but with limited data it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 49. We output the entire 96 points.\n\n 50. We'll generate the dates in the required format.\n\n 51.
