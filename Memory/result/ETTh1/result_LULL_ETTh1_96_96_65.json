        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series structure with hourly frequency.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided data we don't see any (it's 96 consecutive hours). However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data shows some daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours),\n we can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal Naive method - using the last available season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, and repeat for 4 days.\n   However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly repeating. For example, the first day (2017-03-18) and the next days have different levels.\n\n Option 2: Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). But we have only 4 days (96 points) which is minimal for daily seasonality.\n\n Option 3: ARIMA with seasonal component (SARIMA). Again, with only 4 days, it might be challenging to fit.\n\n Given the constraints, we must provide a forecast for 96 points. We can try to capture the daily pattern by averaging the four days we have for each hour and then use that as the daily pattern, and adjust by the overall level.\n\n However, note that the data does not have a clear trend but has daily seasonality. We can do:\n\n  Step 1: Compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n  Step 2: Since we are forecasting the next 4 days, we can use the computed hourly averages for each of the next 96 hours.\n\n But wait, the data shows a possible drift? Let's check the overall level:\n\n  Day 1: 2017-03-18: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n  Day 2: 2017-03-19: average\n  Day 3: 2017-03-20: average\n  Day 4: 2017-03-21: average\n\n  We can compute the overall average of the entire 96 points and then use the relative hourly pattern.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-21) as the base and adjust by the hourly pattern? \n\n  However, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n  Let me compute the hourly averages:\n\n  We have 4 observations for each hour (from 4 days). We can take the mean for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n  Then, we use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days.\n\n  But note: the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall average per day:\n\n  2017-03-18: \n    0.579,0.640,0.579,0.731,0.731,0.761,1.005,1.036,1.340,1.127,1.157,1.249,0.731,1.279,1.249,1.462,1.097,0.944,0.731,0.761,0.731,0.822,0.670,0.914\n    average = (sum of these 24) / 24 = 0.95125\n\n  2017-03-19: \n    1.340,1.371,1.492,0.914,0.975,0.853,0.914,0.944,1.005,1.157,1.097,0.944,0.822,0.975,1.036,1.036,0.975,1.005,1.005,0.701,0.761,0.761,0.761,0.792\n    average = 0.97875\n\n  2017-03-20:\n    0.761,0.701,0.761,0.761,0.731,0.853,0.761,0.914,1.157,1.218,1.066,1.036,0.701,1.036,1.097,0.883,0.944,0.853,0.701,0.761,0.731,0.853,0.670,0.761\n    average = 0.8604166667\n\n  2017-03-21:\n    1.279,1.249,0.640,0.579,0.731,0.883,0.975,1.005,1.157,1.097,1.127,1.005,0.853,1.036,0.975,0.914,0.914,0.822,0.883,0.761,0.670,0.822,0.853,0.853\n    average = 0.9404166667\n\n  The averages are: 0.95125, 0.97875, 0.8604, 0.9404. There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend. \n\n  Therefore, we can use the overall hourly pattern.\n\n  How to compute the hourly pattern:\n\n    For hour 0: (0.579 + 1.340 + 0.761 + 1.279) / 4 = (0.579+1.340+0.761+1.279)=3.959/4=0.98975\n    For hour 1: (0.640+1.371+0.701+1.249)/4 = (0.640+1.371+0.701+1.249)=3.961/4=0.99025\n    ... and so on.\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n    Day1 (2017-03-22): hour0, hour1, ... hour23 -> the computed hourly averages for hour0 to hour23.\n    Day2 (2017-03-23): same hourly averages\n    Day3 (2017-03-24): same\n    Day4 (2017-03-25): same\n\n  But note: the problem does not to omit any content and must provide the complete data.\n\n  However, we must also consider that the data might have a slight trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to tell. The averages per day are fluctuating.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the overall average of the entire 96 points and then the relative index for each hour? \n\n  But the method above (average per hour over the 4 days) is a common seasonal naive approach when we have seasons.\n\n  Let's do:\n\n    total_avg = (0.95125+0.97875+0.8604+0.9404)/4 = 0.9327\n\n    Then the hourly indices (relative to the total average) would be: hourly_avg / total_avg? \n\n  Actually, we don't need to do that because we are going to use the hourly averages as the forecast.\n\n  However, note: the hourly averages are computed from the 4 days and we are going to use them for the next 4 days.\n\n  But the level of the series might be changing? We don't have a strong reason to adjust the level because the daily averages are around 0.93.\n\n  So we'll use the computed averages for each hour.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Step 2: Repeat the 24-hour pattern 4 times to get 96 points.\n\n  We'll generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-03-22 00:00:00.\n\n  The last date in the given data is 2017-03-21 23:00:00. So the next date: \n      2017-03-22 00:00:00, 01:00:00, ... until 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n  Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    hour0: [0.579, 1.340, 0.761, 1.279] -> (0.579+1.340+0.761+1.279)/4 = 3.959/4 = 0.98975\n    hour1: [0.640, 1.371, 0.701, 1.249] -> (0.640+1.371+0.701+1.249)=3.961/4=0.99025\n    hour2: [0.579, 1.492, 0.761, 0.640] -> (0.579+1.492+0.761+0.640)=3.472/4=0.868\n    hour3: [0.731, 0.914, 0.761, 0.579] -> (0.731+0.914+0.761+0.579)=2.985/4=0.74625\n    hour4: [0.731, 0.975, 0.731, 0.731] -> (0.731+0.975+0.731+0.731)=3.168/4=0.792\n    hour5: [0.761, 0.853, 0.853, 0.883] -> (0.761+0.853+0.853+0.883)=3.35/4=0.8375\n    hour6: [1.005, 0.914, 0.761, 0.975] -> (1.005+0.914+0.761+0.975)=3.655/4=0.91375\n    hour7: [1.036, 0.944, 0.914, 1.005] -> (1.036+0.944+0.914+1.005)=3.899/4=0.97475\n    hour8: [1.340, 1.005, 1.157, 1.157] -> (1.340+1.005+1.157+1.157)=4.659/4=1.16475\n    hour9: [1.127, 1.157, 1.218, 1.097] -> (1.127+1.157+1.218+1.097)=4.599/4=1.14975\n    hour10: [1.157, 1.097, 1.066, 1.127] -> (1.157+1.097+1.066+1.127)=4.447/4=1.11175\n    hour11: [1.249, 0.944, 1.036, 1.005] -> (1.249+0.944+1.036+1.005)=4.234/4=1.0585\n    hour12: [0.731, 0.822, 0.701, 0.853] -> (0.731+0.822+0.701+0.853)=3.107/4=0.77675\n    hour13: [1.279, 0.975, 1.036, 1.036] -> (1.279+0.975+1.036+1.036)=4.326/4=1.0815\n    hour14: [1.249, 1.036, 1.097, 0.975] -> (1.249+1.036+1.097+0.975)=4.357/4=1.08925\n    hour15: [1.462, 1.036, 0.883, 0.914] -> (1.462+1.036+0.883+0.914)=4.295/4=1.07375\n    hour16: [1.097, 0.975, 0.944, 0.914] -> (1.097+0.975+0.944+0.914)=3.93/4=0.9825\n    hour17: [0.944, 1.005, 0.853, 0.822] -> (0.944+1.005+0.853+0.822)=3.624/4=0.906\n    hour18: [0.731, 1.005, 0.701, 0.883] -> (0.731+1.005+0.701+0.883)=3.32/4=0.83\n    hour19: [0.761, 0.701, 0.761, 0.761] -> (0.761+0.701+0.761+0.761)=2.984/4=0.746\n    hour20: [0.731, 0.761, 0.731, 0.670] -> (0.731+0.761+0.731+0.670)=2.893/4=0.72325\n    hour21: [0.822, 0.761, 0.853, 0.822] -> (0.822+0.761+0.853+0.822)=3.258/4=0.8145\n    hour22: [0.670, 0.761, 0.670, 0.853] -> (0.670+0.761+0.670+0.853)=2.954/4=0.7385\n    hour23: [0.914, 0.792, 0.761, 0.853] -> (0.914+0.792+0.761+0.853)=3.32/4=0.83\n\n  Now, we create the forecast:\n\n    Day1: 2017-03-22: \n        00:00:00 -> 0.98975\n        01:00:00 -> 0.99025\n        02:00:00 -> 0.868\n        03:00:00 -> 0.74625\n        04:00:00 -> 0.792\n        05:00:00 -> 0.8375\n        06:00:00 -> 0.91375\n        07:00:00 -> 0.97475\n        08:00:00 -> 1.16475\n        09:00:00 -> 1.14975\n        10:00:00 -> 1.11175\n        11:00:00 -> 1.0585\n        12:00:00 -> 0.77675\n        13:00:00 -> 1.0815\n        14:00:00 -> 1.08925\n        15:00:00 -> 1.07375\n        16:00:00 -> 0.9825\n        17:00:00 -> 0.906\n        18:00:00 -> 0.83\n        19:00:00 -> 0.746\n        20:00:00 -> 0.72325\n        21:00:00 -> 0.8145\n        22:00:00 -> 0.7385\n        23:00:00 -> 0.83\n\n    Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not been given any missing values in the input, so we are forecasting without gaps.\n\n  However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing. So we assume the next 96 are to be forecasted without gaps.\n\n  We'll generate 96 points by repeating the above 24 values 4 times.\n\n  Format: We must output the date and the forecasted LULL value.\n\n  We'll generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-03-22 00:00:00\n    Then 2017-03-22 01:00:00, ... until 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll write the forecasted values with 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n  However, note: the computed averages might have more than 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n  Let's round the hourly averages to 3 decimals:\n\n    hour0: 0.990\n    hour1: 0.990\n    hour2: 0.868\n    hour3: 0.746\n    hour4: 0.792\n    hour5: 0.838\n    hour6: 0.914\n    hour7: 0.975\n    hour8: 1.165\n    hour9: 1.150\n    hour10: 1.112\n    hour11: 1.059\n    hour12: 0.777\n    hour13: 1.082\n    hour14: 1.089\n    hour15: 1.074\n    hour16: 0.983\n    hour17: 0.906\n    hour18: 0.830\n    hour19: 0.746\n    hour20: 0.723\n    hour21: 0.815\n    hour22: 0.739\n    hour23: 0.830\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is the above 24 numbers repeated 4 times.\n\n  We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n  Important: The answer must be enclosed in <answer> and </answer> tags, and the data must be in the same format as the input (with the date and LULL value).\n\n  Let's generate the data:\n\n    We'll create a list of dates from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00 (96 points) and assign the LULL values by cycling the 24-hour pattern.\n\n  Code for generating the dates:\n\n    start_date = datetime(2017, 3,22, 0,0,0)\n    then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n  But we are writing manually? We can do:\n\n    Day1: 2017-03-22 00:00:00 -> 0.990\n          2017-03-22 01:00:00 -> 0.990\n          ... until 2017-03-22 23:00:00 -> 0.830\n\n    Day2: 2017-03-23 00:00:00 -> 0.990\n          ... and so on.\n\n  We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        date  LULL\n        2017-03-22 00:00:00 0.990\n        2017-03-22 01:00:00 0.990\n        ...\n\n  We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 lines.\n\n  Let's do it.\n\n  Note: We are rounding the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n  However, note that the input had values like 0.579, 0.640, etc. So we are following the same precision.\n\n  We'll output the data as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-22 00:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-22 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-22 02:00:00 0.868\n2017-03-22 03:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-22 04:00:00 0.792\n2017-03-22 05:00:00 0.838\n2017-03-22 06:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-22 07:00:00 0.975\n2017-03-22 08:00:00 1.165\n2017-03-22 09:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-22 10:00:00 1.112\n2017-03-22 11:00:00 1.059\n2017-03-22 12:00:00 0.777\n2017-03-22 13:00:00 1.082\n2017-03-22 14:00:00 1.089\n2017-03-22 15:00:00 1.074\n2017-03-22 16:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-22 17:00:00 0.906\n2017-03-22 18:00:00 0.830\n2017-03-22 19:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-22 20:00:00 0.723\n2017-03-22 21:00:00 0.815\n2017-03-22 22:00:00 0.739\n2017-03-22 23:00:00 0.830\n2017-03-23 00:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-23 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-23 02:00:00 0.868\n2017-03-23 03:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-23 04:00:00 0.792\n2017-03-23 05:00:00 0.838\n2017-03-23 06:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-23 07:00:00 0.975\n2017-03-23 08:00:00 1.165\n2017-03-23 09:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-23 10:00:00 1.112\n2017-03-23 11:00:00 1.059\n2017-03-23 12:00:00 0.777\n2017-03-23 13:00:00 1.082\n2017-03-23 14:00:00 1.089\n2017-03-23 15:00:00 1.074\n2017-03-23 16:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-23 17:00:00 0.906\n2017-03-23 18:00:00 0.830\n2017-03-23 19:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-23 20:00:00 0.723\n2017-03-23 21:00:00 0.815\n2017-03-23 22:00:00 0.739\n2017-03-23 23:00:00 0.830\n2017-03-24 00:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-24 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-24 02:00:00 0.868\n2017-03-24 03:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-24 04:00:00 0.792\n2017-03-24 05:00:00 0.838\n2017-03-24 06:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-24 07:00:00 0.975\n2017-03-24 08:00:00 1.165\n2017-03-24 09:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-24 10:00:00 1.112\n2017-03-24 11:00:00 1.059\n2017-03-24 12:00:00 0.777\n2017-03-24 13:00:00 1.082\n2017-03-24 14:00:00 1.089\n2017-03-24 15:00:00 1.074\n2017-03-24 16:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-24 17:00:00 0.906\n2017-03-24 18:00:00 0.830\n2017-03-24 19:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-24 20:00:00 0.723\n2017-03-24 21:00:00 0.815\n2017-03-24 22:00:00 0.739\n2017-03-24 23:00:00 0.830\n2017-03-25 00:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-25 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-25 02:00:00 0.868\n2017-03-25 03:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-25 04:00:00 0.792\n2017-03-25 05:00:00 0.838\n2017-03-25 06:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-25 07:00:00 0.975\n2017-03-25 08:00:00 1.165\n2017-03-25 09:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-25 10:00:00 1.112\n2017-03-25 11:00:00 1.059\n2017-03-25 12:00:00 0.777\n2017-03-25 13:00:00 1.082\n2017-03-25 14:00:00 1.089\n2017-03-25 15:00:00 1.074\n2017-03-25 16:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-25 17:00:00 0.906\n2017-03-25 18:00:00 0.830\n2017-03-25 19:00:00 0.746\n2017-03-25 20:00:00 0.723\n2017-03-25 21:00:00 0.815\n2017-03-25 22:00:00 0.739\n2017-03-25 23:00:00 0.830\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n  This is the forecast.\n\n  Note: This is a simple method. In practice, we might use more sophisticated models, but given the data (only 4 days) and the requirement, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n  We are aware of the possibility of missing values, but since the input data had no missing values and we are forecasting, we assume no missing in the forecast period.\n\n  We output the complete 96 points.\n\n  Let me double-check the rounding:\n\n    hour0: 0.98975 -> 0.990 (rounded to 3 decimals: 0.990)\n    hour1: 0.99025 -> 0.990\n    hour2: 0.868 -> 0.868\n    hour3: 0.74625 -> 0.746\n    hour4: 0.792 -> 0.792\n    hour5: 0.8375 -> 0.838 (because 0.8375 rounds to 0.838? \n        Actually, 0.8375: rounding to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 0.838)\n    hour6: 0.91375 -> 0.914\n    hour7: 0.97475 -> 0.975\n    hour8: 1.16475 -> 1.165\n    hour9: 1.14975 -> 1.150\n    hour10: 1.11175 -> 1.112\n    hour11: 1.0585 -> 1.059 (because 1.0585: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 1.059)\n    hour12: 0.77675 -> 0.777\n    hour13: 1.0815 -> 1.082\n    hour14: 1.08925 -> 1.089\n    because: 1.08925 -> the 4th decimal is 2, so we don't round up: 1.089? \n        But wait: 1.08925: \n            The third decimal is 9, and the fourth is 2 -> so we leave the 9 as is -> 1.089\n        However, note: 1.08925 is between 1.089 and 1.090. The third decimal is 9, and the next is 2, so we don't round up -> 1.089.\n        But the input had 1.08925 -> we are rounding to 3 decimals: 1.089.\n    hour15: 1.07375 -> 1.074\n    hour16: 0.9825 -> 0.983? \n        0.9825: the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 0.983\n    hour17: 0.906 -> 0.906\n    hour18: 0.83 -> 0.830 (we write as 0.830 to keep 3 decimals)\n        Actually, 0.83 is 0.830, so we write 0.830.\n    hour19: 0.746 -> 0.746\n    hour20: 0.72325 -> 0.723\n    hour21: 0.8145 -> 0.815? \n        0.8145: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 0.815\n    hour22: 0.7385 -> 0.739\n    hour23: 0.83 -> 0.830\n\n  So we adjust:\n\n    hour14: 1.089 (not 1.08925 -> 1.089)\n    hour20: 0.723 (not 0.72325 -> 0.723)\n\n  But wait, let me check the rounding rules:\n\n    For 3 decimals, we look at the 4th decimal:\n\n      if 4th decimal < 5, then leave the 3rd as is.\n      if 4th decimal >=5, then round up the 3rd.\n\n    So:\n\n      hour5: 0.8375 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 0.838\n      hour6: 0.91375 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 0.914\n      hour7: 0.97475 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 0.975\n      hour8: 1.16475 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 1.165\n      hour9: 1.14975 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 1.150\n      hour10: 1.11175 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 1.112\n      hour11: 1.0585 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 1.059\n      hour12: 0.77675 -> 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 0.777\n      hour13: 1.0815 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 1.082\n      hour14: 1.08925 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> leave: 1.089\n      hour15: 1.07375 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 1.074\n      hour16: 0.9825 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 0.983\n      hour20: 0.72325 -> 4th decimal is 2 -> leave: 0.723\n      hour21: 0.8145 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 0.815\n      hour22: 0.7385 -> 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 0.739\n\n  So the corrected hourly averages:\n\n    hour0: 0.990\n    hour1: 0.990\n    hour2: 0.868\n    hour3: 0.746\n    hour4: 0.792\n    hour5: 0.838\n    hour6: 0.914\n    hour7: 0.975\n    hour8: 1.165\n    hour9: 1.150\n    hour10: 1.112\n    hour11: 1.059\n    hour12: 0.777\n    hour13: 1.082\n    hour14: 1.089\n    hour15: 1.074\n    hour16: 0.983\n    hour17: 0.906\n    hour18: 0.830\n    hour19: 0.746\n    hour20: 0.723\n    hour21: 0.815\n    hour22: 0.739\n    hour23: 0.830\n\n  We'll use these.\n\n  Now, we write the data accordingly.\n\n  We'll output the data in the format above.\n\n  Note: The date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n  We are done.\n",
