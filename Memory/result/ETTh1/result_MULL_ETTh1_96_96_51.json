        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, the provided sample does not show any missing values. So we assume that the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days (24*4=96).\n\n 3. We must be cautious: the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So for the next 96, we are to generate without missing? But the instruction says \"complete data\". We are to provide 96 forecasted points without any missing.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the small size (96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we might consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple naive approach.\n    - However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (24 hours). We can see that by looking at the values: for example, on each day the values go through similar cycles.\n\n 5. We observe the data:\n    - The values are negative, which is acceptable as they might be normalized.\n    - There seems to be a daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 6. We can use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 7. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days, we might face challenges. But we can try.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Since we have exactly 4 days of data, we can compute the average of each hour across the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a possible pattern. However, we see that the data has a trend? Let's check:\n\n    Looking at the data, the values are becoming more negative over the 4 days. For example, the minimum on the first day is about -2.061, then the next day -2.630, then -3.376, then -3.376 again? So there might be a downward trend.\n\n 9. We can try to model the trend and seasonality.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will use a simple decomposition with trend and seasonality, and then project the trend and use the seasonal component.\n\n 11. Steps for decomposition:\n     - We have 96 points, which is 4 cycles of 24.\n     - We can compute the time series as: \n          Y(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonality(t) + Residual(t)\n     - For the trend, we can use a moving average of 24 to remove the seasonality and then fit a linear regression on the trend component.\n     - Then, we can compute the seasonal indices for each hour of the day by averaging the detrended series for each hour.\n     - Then, we extend the trend for the next 96 points and add the seasonal indices (cycled every 24 hours).\n\n 12. However, note that the trend might not be linear? We see that the values are decreasing but then on the last day they are still decreasing? We can try linear or quadratic.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the Holt-Winters method (triple exponential smoothing) which is designed for seasonality and trend.\n\n 14. Given the small data, we can use Holt-Winters with additive seasonality (since the seasonality amplitude seems constant) and additive trend? But the trend might be multiplicative? Let's see: the trend is linear? \n\n 15. We'll use the `statsmodels` library in Python to fit an ExponentialSmoothing model. But note: we are to generate the forecast without any missing, so we must produce 96 numbers.\n\n 16. However, since we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code, we have to reason and generate a forecast manually.\n\n 17. But the problem requires a complete answer. We must provide 96 numbers.\n\n 18. Given the complexity and the fact that we cannot run code, we might use a simpler method: \n\n     - We note that the data has a daily cycle. We can take the last day (24 points) and use it as the forecast for the next day? But that ignores the trend.\n\n     - Alternatively, we can compute the average of the 4 days for each hour and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n 19. Let's break down:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the daily average for each day to see the trend in daily level:\n\n        Day1 (2017-01-21): average of 24 points: \n          We can calculate: \n            -0.533, -1.208, ... , -1.102 -> average = ?\n\n        But we don't need exact, we can see the daily averages are decreasing.\n\n     Step 2: We can fit a linear trend to the daily averages.\n\n        Day1: t=1, average = m1\n        Day2: t=2, average = m2\n        Day3: t=3, average = m3\n        Day4: t=4, average = m4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days: t=5,6,7,8.\n\n     Step 3: For each hour in the day, we have 4 observations. We can compute the deviation from the daily average for that day for each hour.\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) on day d: \n            deviation_h_d = value - m_d\n\n        Then the seasonal index for hour h is the average of the deviations for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n     Step 4: Then the forecast for day 5, hour h: \n            forecast = (trend at day5) + seasonal_index_h\n\n        Similarly for day6, day7, day8.\n\n 20. How to get the trend at day5? We fit a linear regression to (1, m1), (2, m2), (3, m3), (4, m4). Then at t=5, we have the trend value.\n\n 21. But note: the daily average might not be linear? We can try linear.\n\n 22. Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n     Day1 (2017-01-21): \n        We have 24 points. We can calculate the average by summing and dividing by 24.\n\n        Sum = \n          -0.533 + (-1.208) + (-1.421) + (-1.315) + (-0.533) + (-1.137) + (-1.919) + (-1.670) + (-0.462) + (-1.777) +

      Day2: -1.4805\n        Day3: -2.0743\n        Day4: -2.5999\n\n     We fit a linear regression: \n        t: [1,2,3,4]\n        y: [-1.0676, -1.4805, -2.0743, -2.5999]\n\n     We can use least squares:\n\n        slope (b) = [n*sum(t_i * y_i) - sum(t_i)*sum(y_i)] / [n*sum(t_i^2) - (sum(t_i))^2]\n        intercept (a) = [sum(y_i) - b * sum(t_i)] / n\n\n        n=4\n        sum(t_i) = 1+2+3+4

Now, compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n     For each hour h (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from day1 to day4). We compute the deviation from the daily average for that day.\n\n     Then, the seasonal index for hour h is the average of these 4 deviations.\n\n     Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n\n        Day1: value = -0.533, daily_avg1 = -1.0676 -> deviation = -0.533 - (-1.0676) = 0.5346\n        Day2: value = -1.670, daily_avg2 = -1.4805 -> deviation = -1.670 - (-1.4805) = -0.1895\n        Day3: value = -1.954, daily_avg3 = -2.0743 -> deviation = -1.954 - (-2.0743) = 0.1203\n        Day4: value = -2.843, daily_avg4 = -2.5999 -> deviation = -2.843 - (-2.5999) = -0.2431\n\n        Average deviation for hour0 = (0.5346 -0.1895 +0.1203 -0.2431)/4 = (0.5346+0.1203 = 0.6549; -0.1895-0.2431=-0.4326; 0.6549-0.4326=0.2223) -> 0.2223/4 = 0.055575\n\n     Similarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\n 24. Then, the forecast for:\n\n        Day5, hour0: trend(5) + seasonal_index0 = -3.10325 + 0.055575 = -3.047675\n        Day5, hour1: trend(5) + seasonal_index1 = -3.10325 + (seasonal_index1)\n\n     and so on.\n\n 25. We must compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours.\n\n 26. However, note: the problem requires 96 points. We are going to do:\n\n        Day5: 24 hours: t=5, with the 24 seasonal indices.\n        Day6: t=6, with the same 24 seasonal indices (cycled).\n        Day7: t=7, same.\n        Day8: t=8, same.\n\n 27. But note: the trend is changing per day, but the seasonal index per hour is fixed.\n\n 28. We must compute the 24 seasonal indices. We'll do it for each hour.\n\n 29. Given the time, we will compute the seasonal indices for each hour.
