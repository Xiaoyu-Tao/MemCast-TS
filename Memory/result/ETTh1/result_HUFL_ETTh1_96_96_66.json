        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. However, the provided sample does not show any missing value. So for the given 96 points, we can use as is.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data, we can consider a seasonal pattern of 24 hours.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that can capture seasonality.\n\n 4. We'll use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,s). Since we have hourly data and expect daily seasonality, s=24.\n\n 5. However, note that the data might have non-constant variance or mean. We might need to difference the data to make it stationary.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, but ETS for hourly data with daily seasonality (seasonal period 24) and 96 data points might be challenging.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 96 points (which is exactly 4 days), we can try to capture the daily pattern.\n\n 8. We can also consider using a naive seasonal method, but we are required to be accurate.\n\n 9. We'll use SARIMA. We need to find the best parameters. But due to the small data, we can try a standard set.\n\n 10. Let's check the data: \n      - The data shows a clear daily pattern (with higher values at night and lower during the day? Actually, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day, but there is a cycle).\n\n 11. We can try to decompose the series to see the trend and seasonality.\n\n 12. However, since we are in a text-based environment and without the ability to run code, we have to rely on a standard approach.\n\n 13. We can use a SARIMA model with parameters: (1,1,1) for non-seasonal and (1,1,1,24) for seasonal. This is a common starting point.\n\n 14. But note: the data might have a trend. We can difference once (d=1) and seasonally difference once (D=1) with period 24.\n\n 15. We'll fit a SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1,24) model on the 96 points and forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 16. However, without actually running the code (since this is a simulated environment), we have to generate the forecast.\n\n 17. But the problem says: \"must provide the complete data\", meaning we have to output the next 96 dates and the forecasted HUFL values.\n\n 18. Since I cannot run the model here, I will simulate the forecast by:\n\n      a) Taking the last 24 hours (one day) and repeating it 4 times (for the next 4 days). But that would be naive and might not capture the trend.\n\n      b) Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But we only have 4 days.\n\n      c) We can compute the average for each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that as the next 4 days.\n\n      However, note that the data might have a trend. But looking at the data, the values on 2017-03-25 are generally lower than the previous days? \n\n      Let's check the first hour (00:00) of each day:\n        2017-03-22 00:00:00: 9.645\n        2017-03-23 00:00:00: 15.271\n        2017-03-24 00:00:00: 13.597\n        2017-03-25 00:00:00: 9.377\n\n      There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend. So we can use the average per hour.\n\n 19. Steps for the average method:\n\n      - Group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the day).\n      - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of the 4 days we have.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for that hour.\n\n 20. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can compute the average.\n\n 21. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: (9.645 + 15.271 + 13.597 + 9.377) / 4 = (47.89) / 4 = 11.9725\n      Hour 1: (11.588 + 16.075 + 12.324 + 11.052) / 4 = (51.039) / 4 = 12.75975\n      ... and so on.\n\n 22. Then the forecast for 2017-03-26 00:00:00 would be the average for hour 0, 2017-03-26 01:00:00 the average for hour 1, etc.\n\n 23. However, this method ignores any trend and any autocorrelation. But it is a simple and robust method for short-term forecasting when the series has a strong seasonal pattern and no strong trend.\n\n 24. Given the data, we see that the values on the last day (2017-03-25) are generally lower? But we don't have a clear trend. So we use the average.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n 26. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 27. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not encountered in the given 96, so we proceed.\n\n 28. We must generate the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00).\n\n 29. We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n 30. Let me compute the averages:\n\n      We have 4 days, each with 24 hours.\n\n      We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n      For hour 0 (00:00): \n        day1: 9.645, day2: 15.271, day3: 13.597, day4: 9.377 -> average = (9.645+15.271+13.597+9.377)/4 = 47.89/4 = 11.9725\n\n      For hour 1 (01:00):\n        day1: 11.588, day2: 16.075, day3: 12.324, day4: 11.052 -> (11.588+16.075+12.324+11.052)=50.039 -> 50.039/4=12.50975\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 31. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 32. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day 5 (2017-03-26): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day 6 (2017-03-27): same as above\n        Day 7 (2017-03-28): same\n        Day 8 (2017-03-29): same\n\n 33. We must generate the dates as well.\n\n 34. The last date in the given data is 2017-03-25 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-03-26 00:00:00.\n\n 35. We'll generate the next 96 hours by adding 1 hour each time.\n\n 36. We'll write the forecast in the same format.\n\n 37. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 38. But wait, the problem says the data might have missing values? We are forecasting without missing values? We are to forecast the next 96 without missing? So we output 96 values.\n\n 39. We'll compute the averages for each hour:\n\n      Let me compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n        Hour 0: (9.645 + 15.271 + 13.597 + 9.377) / 4 = 47.89 / 4 = 11.9725\n        Hour 1: (11.588 + 16.075 + 12.324 + 11.052) / 4 = 51.039 / 4 = 12.75975\n        Hour 2: (11.655 + 14.468 + 12.860 + 10.114) / 4 = 49.097 / 4 = 12.27425\n        Hour 3: (8.707 + 14.937 + 12.726 + 9.846) / 4 = 46.216 / 4 = 11.554\n        Hour 4: (10.047 + 14.669 + 13.731 + 10.315) / 4 = 48.762 / 4 = 12.1905\n        Hour 5: (11.788 + 9.980 + 14.133 + 8.707) / 4 = 44.608 / 4 = 11.152\n        Hour 6: (10.985 + 11.253 + 12.257 + 10.851) / 4 = 45.346 / 4 = 11.3365\n        Hour 7: (12.860 + 13.195 + 13.061 + 9.578) / 4 = 48.694 / 4 = 12.1735\n        Hour 8: (9.846 + 9.846 + 11.253 + 5.157) / 4 = 36.102 / 4 = 9.0255\n        Hour 9: (7.502 + 3.416 + 6.698 + 2.880) / 4 = 20.496 / 4 = 5.124\n        Hour 10: (6.966 -0.201 + 8.105 -2.746) / 4 = (6.966-0.201+8.105-2.746) = 12.124 / 4 = 3.031\n        Hour 11: (7.368 + 2.947 + 8.105 -4.622) / 4 = (7.368+2.947+8.105-4.622)=13.798 / 4 = 3.4495\n        Hour 12: (5.894 -2.612 + 5.693 -1.942) / 4 = (5.894-2.612+5.693-1.942)=7.033 / 4 = 1.75825\n        Hour 13: (5.559 + 0.000 + 7.435 -9.846) / 4 = (5.559+0+7.435-9.846)=3.148 / 4 = 0.787\n        Hour 14: (6.497 + 1.407 + 6.095 -4.488) / 4 = (6.497+1.407+6.095-4.488)=9.511 / 4 = 2.37775\n        Hour 15: (6.899 + 2.947 + 5.760 -6.296) / 4 = (6.899+2.947+5.760-6.296)=9.31 / 4 = 2.3275\n        Hour 16: (7.703 + 3.550 + 6.430 + 4.220) / 4 = 21.903 / 4 = 5.47575\n        Hour 17: (9.109 + 8.372 + 7.971 + 5.358) / 4 = 30.81 / 4 = 7.7025\n        Hour 18: (8.172 + 7.837 + 7.636 + 7.569) / 4 = 31.214 / 4 = 7.8035\n        Hour 19: (8.105 + 8.506 + 8.372 + 8.172) / 4 = 33.155 / 4 = 8.28875\n        Hour 20: (7.435 + 7.971 + 7.100 + 8.306) / 4 = 30.812 / 4 = 7.703\n        Hour 21: (7.100 + 9.243 + 6.363 + 9.377) / 4 = 32.083 / 4 = 8.02075\n        Hour 22: (8.774 + 8.573 + 6.765 + 9.109) / 4 = 33.221 / 4 = 8.30525\n        Hour 23: (10.918 + 9.176 + 8.439 + 9.109) / 4 = 37.642 / 4 = 9.4105\n\n 40. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-26 00:00:00 -> hour0: 11.9725\n               2017-03-26 01:00:00 -> hour1: 12.75975\n               ... until 2017-03-26 23:00:00 -> hour23: 9.4105\n\n        Then 2017-03-27 00:00:00 -> hour0: 11.9725\n        ... and so on until 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n 41. We'll write the data in the same format: two columns: date and HUFL, with HUFL rounded to 6 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 42. However, note: the input has 6 decimal places, but the averages we computed with more precision. We'll round to 6 decimal places.\n\n 43. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-26 00:00:00\n        Then add one hour until 2017-03-29 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n\n 44.
