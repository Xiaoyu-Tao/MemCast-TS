        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-05-09 00:00:00 to 2017-05-12 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). The pattern: \n    - Temperatures are higher during the night and early morning (positive values) and drop during the day (negative values).\n 2. We also note that there might be a weekly pattern, but we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly seasonality. \n    However, the problem only asks for the next 96 hours (4 days) so we can rely on daily seasonality.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data has missing values (though the provided 96 points are complete), \n we must use a method that can handle time series with seasonality and provide long-range forecasts.\n\n Given the constraints, we are not given any other variables (like load) for forecasting, so we use univariate forecasting.\n\n We can use:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality\n   - Or a simple method: use the average of the same hour from the previous 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data shows a pattern that is not exactly the same every day, but similar.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can use a method that uses the average of the same hour \n over the available days (4 days) and then adjust for any trend if necessary.\n\n But note: the data has a trend? Let's see:\n\n  The values from 2017-05-09 to 2017-05-12: \n    - The daily pattern is similar: \n        * Night and early morning: positive (around 5 to 9)\n        * Daytime: negative (down to -18)\n\n  However, looking at the values, there is a slight change from day to day? \n\n  We are going to use the following method:\n\n  For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n\n  Then, we use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n  But note: the problem says there are missing values in the data? However, the provided 96 points are complete. \n  So we can use them.\n\n  However, this method would ignore any trend. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last 4 days, \n  and then project the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n  But since we are only given 4 days, we can also consider using the last day (2017-05-12) as the base and then adjust by the average \n  of the differences from the same hour in the previous days? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the method. We are the expert.\n\n  Let me choose a simple method: \n    We will use the average of each hour over the 4 days to forecast the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n  Steps for forecasting:\n    For hour h (0<=h<=23) in the day:\n        forecast_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-05-13 to 2017-05-16), we assign:\n        Day 5 (2017-05-13) at hour h: forecast_h\n        Day 6 (2017-05-14) at hour h: forecast_h\n        Day 7 (2017-05-15) at hour h: forecast_h\n        Day 8 (2017-05-16) at hour h: forecast_h\n\n  But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a trend beyond 4 days. \n  Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the last day has more weight? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify. We'll use the simple average.\n\n  Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0: (8.038 + 7.301 + 7.502 + 8.640) / 4 = (8.038+7.301+7.502+8.640)/4 = 31.481/4 = 7.87025\n    Hour 1: (7.502+7.770+6.631+9.176)/4 = (7.502+7.770+6.631+9.176)/4 = 31.079/4 = 7.76975\n    ... and so on.\n\n  We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n  However, note: the data has 4 days, but the last day is 2017-05-12. The next day is 2017-05-13.\n\n  We generate 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n  We must output the dates from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n  Format: \n        date, HUFL\n\n  We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  But note: the problem says there are missing values in the data? However, we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. \n  So we output 96 records without missing values.\n\n  Let's compute the averages:\n\n  We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the 4 values for that hour.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    day1: 2017-05-09 (index 0 to 23)\n    day2: 2017-05-10 (index 24 to 47)\n    day3: 2017-05-11 (index 48 to 71)\n    day4: 2017-05-12 (index 72 to 95)\n\n  We can group by hour of day.\n\n  We'll compute:\n\n    hour0: [8.038, 7.301, 7.502, 8.640] -> average = (8.038+7.301+7.502+8.640)/4 = 31.481/4 = 7.87025 -> 7.870\n    hour1: [7.502, 7.770, 6.631, 9.176] -> 31.079/4 = 7.76975 -> 7.770\n    hour2: [7.770, 7.636, 5.760, 7.301] -> (7.770+7.636+5.760+7.301)=28.467 -> 7.11675 -> 7.117\n    hour3: [7.569, 7.167, 6.028, 7.904] -> (7.569+7.167+6.028+7.904)=28.668 -> 7.167\n    hour4: [8.439, 6.899, 6.698, 9.846] -> (8.439+6.899+6.698+9.846)=31.882 -> 7.9705 -> 7.971\n    hour5: [9.511, 9.042, 7.435, 9.377] -> (9.511+9.042+7.435+9.377)=35.365 -> 8.84125 -> 8.841\n    hour6: [8.372, 9.243, 7.368, 9.109] -> (8.372+9.243+7.368+9.109)=34.092 -> 8.523\n    hour7: [7.033, 3.148, 4.488, 7.435] -> (7.033+3.148+4.488+7.435)=22.104 -> 5.526\n    hour8: [2.143, -4.220, -0.201, 4.019] -> (2.143-4.220-0.201+4.019)=1.741 -> 0.43525 -> 0.435\n    hour9: [-5.090, -9.578, -0.469, 3.081] -> (-5.090-9.578-0.469+3.081)= -12.056 -> -3.014\n    hour10: [-13.262, -12.860, -5.358, 2.478] -> (-13.262-12.860-5.358+2.478)= -29.002 -> -7.2505 -> -7.251\n    hour11: [-15.472, -14.870, -13.463, -16.611] -> (-15.472-14.870-13.463-16.611)= -60.416 -> -15.104\n    hour12: [-18.687, -17.951, -13.597, -17.147] -> (-18.687-17.951-13.597-17.147)= -67.382 -> -16.8455 -> -16.846\n    hour13: [-17.817, -17.147, -11.320, -18.754] -> (-17.817-17.147-11.320-18.754)= -65.038 -> -16.2595 -> -16.260\n    hour14: [-14.669, -14.334, -3.282, -12.525] -> (-14.669-14.334-3.282-12.525)= -44.81 -> -11.2025 -> -11.203\n    hour15: [-10.717, -11.253, 2.210, -13.530] -> (-10.717-11.253+2.210-13.530)= -33.29 -> -8.3225 -> -8.323\n    hour16: [-5.894, -5.626, 3.483, -4.957] -> (-5.894-5.626+3.483-4.957)= -12.994 -> -3.2485 -> -3.249\n    hour17: [1.875, 3.081, 6.765, -0.871] -> (1.875+3.081+6.765-0.871)=10.85 -> 2.7125 -> 2.713\n    hour18: [5.559, 4.823, 5.626, 4.622] -> (5.559+4.823+5.626+4.622)=20.63 -> 5.1575 -> 5.158\n    hour19: [6.430, 6.095, 5.961, 5.827] -> (6.430+6.095+5.961+5.827)=24.313 -> 6.07825 -> 6.078\n    hour20: [6.698, 6.430, 6.229, 7.100] -> (6.698+6.430+6.229+7.100)=26.457 -> 6.61425 -> 6.614\n    hour21: [5.760, 5.760, 5.224, 6.363] -> (5.760+5.760+5.224+6.363)=23.107 -> 5.77675 -> 5.777\n    hour22: [4.756, 4.756, 4.689, 5.492] -> (4.756+4.756+4.689+5.492)=19.693 -> 4.92325 -> 4.923\n    hour23: [5.224, 5.157, 4.421, 4.890] -> (5.224+5.157+4.421+4.890)=19.692 -> 4.923\n\n  Now, we will create the next 4 days:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-05-13: hour0 to hour23: [7.870, 7.770, 7.117, 4.923]\n    ... and so on.\n\n  But note: the last hour (hour23) we computed as 4.923.\n\n  However, we must generate 4 days of 24 hours each.\n\n  We'll generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-05-13 00:00:00\n    Then 2017-05-13 01:00:00 ... until 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n  We have 96 records.\n\n  We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n  Let's code it in the answer:\n\n    <answer>\n        2017-05-13 00:00:00,7.870\n        2017-05-13 01:00:00,7.770\n        2017-05-13 02:00:00,7.117\n        2017-05-13 03:00:00,7.167\n        2017-05-13 04:00:00,7.971\n        2017-05-13 05:00:00,8.841\n        2017-05-13 06:00:00,8.523\n        2017-05-13 07:00:00,5.526\n        2017-05-13 08:00:00,0.435\n        2017-05-13 09:00:00,-3.014\n        2017-05-13 10:00:00,-7.251\n        2017-05-13 11:00:00,-15.104\n        2017-05-13 12:00:00,-16.846\n        2017-05-13 13:00:00,-16.260\n        2017-05-13 14:00:00,-11.203\n        2017-05-13 15:00:00,-8.323\n        2017-05-13 16:00:00,-3.249\n        2017-05-13 17:00:00,2.713\n        2017-05-13 18:00:00,5.158\n        2017-05-13 19:00:00,6.078\n        2017-05-13 20:00:00,6.614\n        2017-05-13 21:00:00,5.777\n        2017-05-13 22:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-13 23:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-14 00:00:00,7.870\n        2017-05-14 01:00:00,7.770\n        ... and repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n  But wait, we computed 24 values (for 0 to 23) and we will use the same 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n  Yes, that's the method.\n\n  We'll output 4 days of the same 24-hour pattern.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data has missing values?

You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n  We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-05-13 00:00:00,7.870\n        2017-05-13 01:00:00,7.770\n        2017-05-13 02:00:00,7.117\n        2017-05-13 03:00:00,7.167\n        2017-05-13 04:00:00,7.971\n        2017-05-13 05:00:00,8.841\n        2017-05-13 06:00:00,8.523\n        2017-05-13 07:00:00,5.526\n        2017-05-13 08:00:00,0.435\n        2017-05-13 09:00:00,-3.014\n        2017-05-13 10:00:00,-7.251\n        2017-05-13 11:00:00,-15.104\n        2017-05-13 12:00:00,-16.846\n        2017-05-13 13:00:00,-16.260\n        2017-05-13 14:00:00,-11.203\n        2017-05-13 15:00:00,-8.323\n        2017-05-13 16:00:00,-3.249\n        2017-05-13 17:00:00,2.713\n        2017-05-13 18:00:00,5.158\n        2017-05-13 19:00:00,6.078\n        2017-05-13 20:00:00,6.614\n        2017-05-13 21:00:00,5.777\n        2017-05-13 22:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-13 23:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-14 00:00:00,7.870\n        2017-05-14 01:00:00,7.770\n        2017-05-14 02:00:00,7.117\n        2017-05-14 03:00:00,7.167\n        2017-05-14 04:00:00,7.971\n        2017-05-14 05:00:00,8.841\n        2017-05-14 06:00:00,8.523\n        2017-05-14 07:00:00,5.526\n        2017-05-14 08:00:00,0.435\n        2017-05-14 09:00:00,-3.014\n        2017-05-14 10:00:00,-7.251\n        2017-05-14 11:00:00,-15.104\n        2017-05-14 12:00:00,-16.846\n        2017-05-14 13:00:00,-16.260\n        2017-05-14 14:00:00,-11.203\n        2017-05-14 15:00:00,-8.323\n        2017-05-14 16:00:00,-3.249\n        2017-05-14 17:00:00,2.713\n        2017-05-14 18:00:00,5.158\n        2017-05-14 19:00:00,6.078\n        2017-05-14 20:00:00,6.614\n        2017-05-14 21:00:00,5.777\n        2017-05-14 22:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-14 23:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-15 00:00:00,7.870\n        2017-05-15 01:00:00,7.770\n        2017-05-15 02:00:00,7.117\n        2017-05-15 03:00:00,7.167\n        2017-05-15 04:00:00,7.971\n        2017-05-15 05:00:00,8.841\n        2017-05-15 06:00:00,8.523\n        2017-05-15 07:00:00,5.526\n        2017-05-15 08:00:00,0.435\n        2017-05-15 09:00:00,-3.014\n        2017-05-15 10:00:00,-7.251\n        2017-05-15 11:00:00,-15.104\n        2017-05-15 12:00:00,-16.846\n        2017-05-15 13:00:00,-16.260\n        2017-05-15 14:00:00,-11.203\n        2017-05-15 15:00:00,-8.323\n        2017-05-15 16:00:00,-3.249\n        2017-05-15 17:00:00,2.713\n        2017-05-15 18:00:00,5.158\n        2017-05-15 19:00:00,6.078\n        2017-05-15 20:00:00,6.614\n        2017-05-15 21:00:00,5.777\n        2017-05-15 22:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-15 23:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-16 00:00:00,7.870\n        2017-05-16 01:00:00,7.770\n        2017-05-16 02:00:00,7.117\n        2017-05-16 03:00:00,7.167\n        2017-05-16 04:00:00,7.971\n        2017-05-16 05:00:00,8.841\n        2017-05-16 06:00:00,8.523\n        2017-05-16 07:00:00,5.526\n        2017-05-16 08:00:00,0.435\n        2017-05-16 09:00:00,-3.014\n        2017-05-16 10:00:00,-7.251\n        2017-05-16 11:00:00,-15.104\n        2017-05-16 12:00:00,-16.846\n        2017-05-16 13:00:00,-16.260\n        2017-05-16 14:00:00,-11.203\n        2017-05-16 15:00:00,-8.323\n        2017-05-16 16:00:00,-3.249\n        2017-05-16 17:00:00,2.713\n        2017-05-16 18:00:00,5.158\n        2017-05-16 19:00:00,6.078\n        2017-05-16 20:00:00,6.614\n        2017-05-16 21:00:00,5.777\n        2017-05-16 22:00:00,4.923\n        2017-05-16 23:00:00,4.923\n\n  This is the complete forecast.\n\n  Note: We used a simple average method.
