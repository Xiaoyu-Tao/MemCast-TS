        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). The pattern shows:\n    - Higher values during the night (around 00:00 to 06:00) and then a drop during the day (especially in the morning) and then a rise again in the evening.\n\n 2. We also note that there might be some missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing (it's complete). \n    However, the problem says the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But the provided data for the past 96 is complete.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the hourly data and the daily pattern, \n    we can use a seasonal model. One common approach is to use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model.\n\n 4. We must choose the parameters for SARIMA (p,d,q) and seasonal (P,D,Q,s) where s=24 for daily seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data might have non-stationary components. We might need to difference the data to make it stationary.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method if the pattern is very consistent. But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day, \n    so we need a model that can adapt.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to forecast 96 steps (4 days) and the data has a strong daily pattern, \n    we can also consider using a rolling window of the same time of day from the previous days. But the problem says we must be aware of missing values, \n    but in the provided data we don't have any.\n\n 8. Since the problem does not require a specific method, we are to provide the forecasted values.\n\n 9. We will use a simple approach: \n    - We will take the average of the same hour for the last 4 days (since we have 4 days of data) and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the pattern might change. But without more data, this is a simple and reasonable method.\n\n 10. Steps for the simple average method:\n      For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, we have 4 observations (from day1, day2, day3, day4). \n      Then the forecast for the next 4 days at hour h will be the average of the 4 observations for that hour.\n\n 11. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-04-26. We are to forecast from 2017-04-27 to 2017-04-30 (4 days).\n\n 12. Let's break down the data by hour:\n\n      We have:\n        Day 1: 2017-04-23 (00:00 to 23:00) -> 24 hours\n        Day 2: 2017-04-24\n        Day 3: 2017-04-25\n        Day 4: 2017-04-26\n\n      For hour 00:00: \n        values: [10.65, 11.253, 10.583, 13.597] -> average = (10.65+11.253+10.583+13.597)/4 = 46.083/4 = 11.52075\n\n      Similarly for other hours.\n\n 13. Then for the next 4 days (2017-04-27, 2017-04-28, 2017-04-29, 2017-04-30) at each hour we use the same average for that hour.\n\n 14. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. \n     So we are safe to average.\n\n 15. But what if we had missing? We would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware\", but in this case we don't have missing in the provided.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a more robust method that can handle missing values, but since we are not given any missing in the history, \n     and we are only to provide the forecast, we can proceed.\n\n 17. However, note that the pattern might have a weekly seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly. \n     We are forced to use daily.\n\n 18. Let's check: the data from 4/23 to 4/26 are consecutive days (Sunday to Wednesday). The next 4 days would be Thursday to Sunday.\n\n     But we don't have data for Thursday in the history? So we are using the same daily pattern without weekly adjustment.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide the data, we will use the average by hour.\n\n 20. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then we assign:\n\n       2017-04-27 00:00:00 -> average of 00:00\n       2017-04-27 01:00:00 -> average of 01:00\n       ... \n       2017-04-27 23:00:00 -> average of 23:00\n\n       2017-04-28 00:00:00 -> average of 00:00 (same as above)\n       ... and so on.\n\n 22. So the forecast for the next 96 hours is just the 24 averages repeated for 4 days.\n\n 23. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n      hour00: [10.65, 11.253, 10.583, 13.597] -> 46.083 / 4 = 11.52075\n      hour01: [11.855, 12.793, 9.511, 12.458] -> (11.855+12.793+9.511+12.458) = 46.617 / 4 = 11.65425\n      hour02: [10.985, 10.918, 10.516, 12.257] -> (10.985+10.918+10.516+12.257) = 44.676 / 4 = 11.169\n      hour03: [11.052, 10.717, 8.306, 12.056] -> (11.052+10.717+8.306+12.056) = 42.131 / 4 = 10.53275\n      hour04: [11.454, 11.186, 8.372, 9.042] -> (11.454+11.186+8.372+9.042) = 40.054 / 4 = 10.0135\n      hour05: [11.119, 11.454, 9.578, 10.918] -> (11.119+11.454+9.578+10.918) = 43.069 / 4 = 10.76725\n      hour06: [11.721, 12.726, 10.717, 13.128] -> (11.721+12.726+10.717+13.128) = 48.292 / 4 = 12.073\n      hour07: [7.502, 4.756, 8.038, 10.248] -> (7.502+4.756+8.038+10.248) = 30.544 / 4 = 7.636\n      hour08: [0.402, -3.55, 0.402, 9.779] -> (0.402 -3.55 + 0.402 + 9.779) = 7.033 / 4 = 1.75825\n      hour09: [-8.038, -8.64, 1.674, 2.679] -> (-8.038 -8.64 + 1.674 + 2.679) = -12.325 / 4 = -3.08125\n      hour10: [-11.32, -10.717, 0.536, 4.823] -> (-11.32 -10.717 + 0.536 + 4.823) = -16.678 / 4 = -4.1695\n      hour11: [-13.128, -13.463, 4.555, -0.335] -> (-13.128 -13.463 + 4.555 -0.335) = -22.371 / 4 = -5.59275\n      hour12: [-16.544, -16.142, -1.474, -5.492] -> (-16.544 -16.142 -1.474 -5.492) = -39.652 / 4 = -9.913\n      hour13: [-15.941, -15.137, -1.474, -7.837] -> (-15.941 -15.137 -1.474 -7.837) = -40.389 / 4 = -10.09725\n      hour14: [-13.262, -12.525, 2.545, 1.34] -> (-13.262 -12.525 + 2.545 + 1.34) = -21.902 / 4 = -5.4755\n      hour15: [-10.047, -8.707, 2.746, 2.21] -> (-10.047 -8.707 + 2.746 + 2.21) = -13.798 / 4 = -3.4495\n      hour16: [-4.89, -1.875, 6.028, 3.282] -> (-4.89 -1.875 + 6.028 + 3.282) = 2.545 / 4 = 0.63625\n      hour17: [3.952, 2.411, 7.569, 9.846] -> (3.952+2.411+7.569+9.846) = 23.778 / 4 = 5.9445\n      hour18: [5.291, 5.76, 6.698, 7.569] -> (5.291+5.76+6.698+7.569) = 25.318 / 4 = 6.3295\n      hour19: [6.363, 6.698, 6.765, 7.502] -> (6.363+6.698+6.765+7.502) = 27.328 / 4 = 6.832\n      hour20: [6.899, 7.234, 6.229, 6.832] -> (6.899+7.234+6.229+6.832) = 27.194 / 4 = 6.7985\n      hour21: [6.028, 7.1, 7.1, 6.095] -> (6.028+7.1+7.1+6.095) = 26.323 / 4 = 6.58075\n      hour22: [5.626, 6.899, 7.502, 5.894] -> (5.626+6.899+7.502+5.894) = 25.921 / 4 = 6.48025\n      hour23: [8.908, 8.908, 9.779, 8.239] -> (8.908+8.908+9.779+8.239) = 35.834 / 4 = 8.9585\n\n 24. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-04-27 (Thursday) -> hours 00 to 23: [11.52075, 11.65425, ... , 8.9585]\n      Day 2: 2017-04-28 (Friday) -> same 24 values\n      Day 3: 2017-04-29 (Saturday) -> same 24 values\n      Day 4: 2017-04-30 (Sunday) -> same 24 values\n\n 25. We must format the numbers to 6 decimal places as in the input? The input had 3 to 6 decimal places. \n     We'll output with 6 decimal places to be consistent with the input.\n\n 26. However, note: the input had up to 3 decimal places but sometimes 6. We'll output 6.\n\n 27. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-04-27 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-04-27 01:00:00, ... until 2017-04-30 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 29. But note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only given HUFL. \n     We are only forecasting HUFL.\n\n 30. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-27 00:00:00  11.520750\n2017-04-27 01:00:00  11.654250\n2017-04-27 02:00:00  11.169000\n2017-04-27 03:00:00  10.532750\n2017-04-27 04:00:00  10.013500\n2017-04-27 05:00:00  10.767250\n2017-04-27 06:00:00  12.073000\n2017-04-27 07:00:00   7.636000\n2017-04-27 08:00:00   1.758250\n2017-04-27 09:00:00  -3.081250\n2017-04-27 10:00:00  -4.169500\n2017-04-27 11:00:00  -5.592750\n2017-04-27 12:00:00  -9.913000\n2017-04-27 13:00:00 -10.097250\n2017-04-27 14:00:00  -5.475500\n2017-04-27 15:00:00  -3.449500\n2017-04-27 16:00:00   0.636250\n2017-04-27 17:00:00   5.944500\n2017-04-27 18:00:00   6.329500\n2017-04-27 19:00:00   6.832000\n2017-04-27 20:00:00   6.798500\n2017-04-27 21:00:00   6.580750\n2017-04-27 22:00:00   6.480250\n2017-04-27 23:00:00   8.958500\n2017-04-28 00:00:00  11.520750\n2017-04-28 01:00:00  11.654250\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 31.
