        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the input, but in this case, we have 96 consecutive points.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We note that the data is hourly and shows a daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 3. We can use a time series method that can handle seasonality. Since we are to provide a complete forecast for 96 points, we must generate 96 values.\n\n 4. We can use a model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the data, we observe:\n    - The data seems to have a daily pattern: higher values during the day and lower at night? But looking at the data, the pattern is not very clear. \n      For example, on 2017-06-18, the values are higher in the morning (e.g., 4.087 at 09:00) and then decrease in the evening. \n      However, on 2017-06-19, the highest value is 3.660 at 13:00. \n\n 6. We are not given any other variables, so we will use univariate forecasting.\n\n 7. We will use an automated approach to select the best model parameters. However, due to the constraints of this environment, we cannot run extensive model selection.\n\n 8. We can use the `statsmodels` library in Python to fit a SARIMA model. But note: we are in a text-based environment and must output the forecast without running code.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Since the data has seasonality of 24, we can use a seasonal naive forecast (using the last available season) or an average of the last few days.\n\n 10. However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more robust method. But without the ability to run code, we must rely on a heuristic.\n\n 11. Given the constraints, I will use a method that:\n     - First, we can decompose the series to see trend, seasonality, and residuals. But we cannot do that here.\n     - Instead, we can use a moving average to smooth the series and then project the seasonality.\n\n 12. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days (since we have 4 days of data) for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps for the average method:\n        - We have 4 days (96 hours). We can create 24 hourly buckets.\n        - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we have 4 observations (from day1, day2, day3, day4).\n        - Then, the forecast for the same hour in the next day is the average of the same hour in the past 4 days.\n\n     Example for hour 00:00:\n        Day1 (2017-06-18 00:00:00): 2.630\n        Day2 (2017-06-19 00:00:00): 1.706\n        Day3 (2017-06-20 00:00:00): 2.061\n        Day4 (2017-06-21 00:00:00): 1.635\n        Average = (2.630 + 1.706 + 2.061 + 1.635) / 4 = 2.008\n\n     Then the forecast for:\n        2017-06-22 00:00:00: 2.008\n        2017-06-23 00:00:00: we use the same average? But wait, we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same 4-day average for each hour for the next 4 days.\n\n     However, note: the pattern might change? But without a trend component, we are just repeating the average.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days are weighted more. But for simplicity, we use the average.\n\n 14. But note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the data, the values on the last day (2017-06-21) seem a bit lower? \n     However, we only have 4 days. We can try to adjust for a trend by taking a moving average that gives more weight to recent days.\n\n 15. We can use an exponentially weighted moving average by hour? But again, we are limited.\n\n 16. Given the above, I choose to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 17. Steps:\n      - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 18. This method will produce a forecast that repeats the same daily pattern.\n\n 19. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      hour0: (2.630, 1.706, 2.061, 1.635) -> (2.630+1.706+2.061+1.635)/4 = 2.008\n      hour1: (2.203, 1.279, 2.097, 1.741) -> (2.203+1.279+2.097+1.741)/4 = 1.830\n      hour2: (2.168, 2.239, 2.274, 1.741) -> (2.168+2.239+2.274+1.741)/4 = 2.1055\n      hour3: (1.883, 1.670, 2.736, 2.416) -> (1.883+1.670+2.736+2.416)/4 = 2.17625\n      hour4: (1.777, 1.990, 2.381, 1.706) -> (1.777+1.990+2.381+1.706)/4 = 1.9635\n      hour5: (2.381, 1.883, 1.564, 1.670) -> (2.381+1.883+1.564+1.670)/4 = 1.8745\n      hour6: (1.173, 1.706, 1.564, 1.386) -> (1.173+1.706+1.564+1.386)/4 = 1.45725\n      hour7: (1.812, 2.274, 1.670, 2.203) -> (1.812+2.274+1.670+2.203)/4 = 1.98975\n      hour8: (2.132, 2.132, 2.274, 1.954) -> (2.132+2.132+2.274+1.954)/4 = 2.123\n      hour9: (4.087, 3.092, 2.132, 1.812) -> (4.087+3.092+2.132+1.812)/4 = 2.78075\n      hour10: (2.772, 2.914, 2.416, 1.670) -> (2.772+2.914+2.416+1.670)/4 = 2.443\n      hour11: (3.056, 3.198, 3.625, 2.061) -> (3.056+3.198+3.625+2.061)/4 = 2.985\n      hour12: (2.878, 2.345, 3.625, 1.635) -> (2.878+2.345+3.625+1.635)/4 = 2.62075\n      hour13: (1.528, 3.660, 2.416, 3.482) -> (1.528+3.660+2.416+3.482)/4 = 2.7715\n      hour14: (1.883, 2.594, 4.193, 3.767) -> (1.883+2.594+4.193+3.767)/4 = 3.10925\n      hour15: (2.310, 1.883, 1.741, 1.919) -> (2.310+1.883+1.741+1.919)/4 = 1.96325\n      hour16: (2.203, 1.812, 1.564, 1.564) -> (2.203+1.812+1.564+1.564)/4 = 1.78575\n      hour17: (1.741, 1.492, 1.315, 1.528) -> (1.741+1.492+1.315+1.528)/4 = 1.519\n      hour18: (1.244, 0.391, 0.995, 1.173) -> (1.244+0.391+0.995+1.173)/4 = 0.95075\n      hour19: (0.782, -0.071, 0.853, 0.782) -> (0.782 -0.071 +0.853+0.782)/4 = 0.782 + 0.853 + 0.782 = 2.417 -0.071 = 2.346 -> 2.346/4 = 0.5865\n      hour20: (0.569, -0.036, 0.817, 0.675) -> (0.569 -0.036 +0.817+0.675)/4 = (0.569+0.817+0.675)=2.061 -0.036=2.025 -> 2.025/4=0.50625\n      hour21: (0.711, 0.000, 0.924, 0.497) -> (0.711+0+0.924+0.497)/4 = 2.132/4=0.533\n      hour22: (0.675, 0.178, 1.066, 0.355) -> (0.675+0.178+1.066+0.355)/4 = 2.274/4=0.5685\n      hour23: (0.782, 1.173, 0.959, 2.452) -> (0.782+1.173+0.959+2.452)/4 = 5.366/4=1.3415\n\n 20. Now, we create the next 4 days (2017-06-22 to 2017-06-25) by repeating these hourly averages for each day.\n\n 21. The dates will be:\n      Start: 2017-06-22 00:00:00 (next after 2017-06-21 23:00:00)\n      Then 2017-06-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We assign:\n      2017-06-22 00:00:00: 2.008\n      2017-06-22 01:00:00: 1.830\n      ... and so on for 24 hours, then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n 23. However, note: the pattern might be changing? But with only 4 days, we don't have a long history. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 24. But wait: the last value of the given data (2017-06-21 23:00:00) is 2.452, which is an outlier? and our average for hour23 is 1.3415, which is lower. \n     This method smooths out the last day's spike.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we could use only the last day (2017-06-21) to forecast the next day? But that would ignore the previous days.\n\n 26. We stick to the 4-day average.\n\n 27. We generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 28. Format the answer as required.\n\n 29. Note: The problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 30. We output the forecast in the same format: two columns with the timestamp and the MULL value.\n\n 31. Let's write the forecast:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-06-22\n        00:00:00 -> 2.008\n        01:00:00 -> 1.830\n        02:00:00 -> 2.1055\n        03:00:00 -> 2.17625\n        04:00:00 -> 1.9635\n        05:00:00 -> 1.8745\n        06:00:00 -> 1.45725\n        07:00:00 -> 1.98975\n        08:00:00 -> 2.123\n        09:00:00 -> 2.78075\n        10:00:00 -> 2.443\n        11:00:00 -> 2.985\n        12:00:00 -> 2.62075\n        13:00:00 -> 2.7715\n        14:00:00 -> 3.10925\n        15:00:00 -> 1.96325\n        16:00:00 -> 1.78575\n        17:00:00 -> 1.519\n        18:00:00 -> 0.95075\n        19:00:00 -> 0.5865\n        20:00:00 -> 0.50625\n        21:00:00 -> 0.533\n        22:00:00 -> 0.5685\n        23:00:00 -> 1.3415\n\n      Then repeat the same for the next three days.\n\n 32. We must write 96 lines.\n\n 33. We note that the dates must be consecutive and in the correct order.\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n      End: 2017-06-25 23:00:00\n\n 35. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-06-22 00:00:00  2.008\n2017-06-22 01:00:00  1.830\n... \n2017-06-25 23:00:00  1.3415\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 36. We must be cautious: the original data had 3 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimals to match.\n\n 37.
