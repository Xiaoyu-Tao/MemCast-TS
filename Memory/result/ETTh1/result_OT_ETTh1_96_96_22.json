        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? We note that the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are to be cautious.\n 2. We are to model the time series. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not feasible.\n 3. We can use a model that handles seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n However, note: the data shows a clear daily pattern (temperature rises during the day and falls at night) but also a downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n Let's break down the data:\n   Day 1 (2016-09-27): min ~22.58, max ~27.58\n   Day 2 (2016-09-28): min ~9.99, max ~21.74 (note: a significant drop)\n   Day 3 (2016-09-29): min ~9.43, max ~14.70\n   Day 4 (2016-09-30): min ~10.34, max ~18.99\n\n There is a clear drop from day 1 to day 2, then a stabilization? But note the data on day 4 is rising again.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we might consider:\n   - Using a seasonal decomposition and then forecasting the components.\n   - Using a model that can capture both trend and seasonality.\n\n However, note the downward trend might be due to a change in weather or load. Without more context, we have to rely on the pattern.\n\n Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we can proceed.\n\n Approach:\n   We will use a SARIMA model. We note:\n     - The data is non-stationary (mean is changing over time, and there's a drop).\n     - We have seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n   Steps for SARIMA:\n     - We need to difference for seasonality? (D) and non-seasonal (d).\n     - We can try: (p,d,q) for non-seasonal and (P,D,Q,24) for seasonal.\n\n   Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we must be cautious with over-parameterization.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Holt-Winters with additive seasonality (since the seasonality does not seem to grow with the level).\n\n   Let's try to decompose the series to see the components.\n\n   However, note: we are to provide the forecast for the next 96 points. We must output the data in the same format.\n\n   Due to the constraints of the data and the fact that we are in an assistant role without the ability to run code, we will rely on a standard approach.\n\n   We can use an automated model selection (like auto_arima) in our mind? But we are to reason step by step.\n\n   Given the time, we can assume a model:\n\n   After examining the data, we see:\n     - The series has a downward trend in the first two days and then a slight upward on the last day? But overall, the last two days are lower than the first.\n     - The seasonality is daily (24 points per cycle).\n\n   We can try a SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1,24) model? But note: we have only 4 days (96 points) so we cannot have too many parameters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a more robust method: Prophet by Facebook, but again we are to do without code.\n\n   However, the problem says we are an expert, so we must provide a forecast.\n\n   Let me think of a practical approach:\n\n   We can average the daily pattern for the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n   Step 1: Extract the daily seasonality.\n     - We have 4 full days. We can compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n   But note: the level of the temperature is changing. So we might need to normalize.\n\n   Step 2: Model the trend. We can fit a linear trend (or quadratic) to the entire series? But the drop is abrupt.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the overall trend? But the last day (2016-09-30) shows an increase from the previous day.\n\n   We can compute the daily average temperature:\n\n     Day1: average = (23.285+23.496+...+18.572)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n        We see day1: from 23.285 to 18.572, but the values are mostly in the 20s and high 20s -> average around 24?\n     Day2: from 22.511 to 14.843 -> average around 18?\n     Day3: from 13.788 to 10.341 -> average around 12?\n     Day4: from 10.482 to 18.993 -> average around 15?\n\n   The daily averages: [approx: 24, 18, 12, 15] -> not a clear trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last two days to project the trend? \n\n   We can do:\n\n     Let the daily average be:\n        Day1: 24.0 (assumed)\n        Day2: 18.0\n        Day3: 12.0\n        Day4: 15.0\n\n     Then the trend from day3 to day4 increased by 3. We might project day5 to be 15 + 3 = 18, day6 to be 21, etc. But that might be too optimistic.\n\n   However, note that the data on day4 is rising and the previous drop might have been an anomaly.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we can use a moving average for the daily average and then apply the seasonal pattern.\n\n   We can use:\n\n     Daily average for the next 4 days: we can take the average of the last two days: (12+15)/2 = 13.5, then for the next 4 days we assume a slow increase? \n\n   But we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). We can assume the daily average for the next 4 days as:\n\n        Day5: 15.5\n        Day6: 16.0\n        Day7: 16.5\n        Day8: 17.0\n\n   This is a linear increase.\n\n   Then, for the seasonal pattern, we can take the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But the levels are different. So we can normalize by the daily average.\n\n   We can compute the seasonal index for each hour:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23): \n          index_h = (value_day1_h / avg_day1 + value_day2_h / avg_day2 + value_day3_h / avg_day3 + value_day4_h / avg_day4) / 4\n\n   Then for a future day with daily average = A, the hour h would be: A * index_h.\n\n   However, we don't have the exact daily averages. We can compute them:\n\n        Day1: \n          We have 24 points: \n          avg_day1 = (23.285+23.496+23.003+23.144+22.933+22.581+22.581+23.003+22.792+23.988+24.762+25.044+26.028+26.943+27.013+27.506+27.576+27.435+26.099+25.255+24.129+23.777+23.426+23.003) / 24\n          Let me calculate:\n\n          Sum_day1 = 23.285+23.496+23.003+23.144+22.933+22.581+22.581+23.003+22.792+23.988+24.762+25.044+26.028+26.943+27.013+27.506+27.576+27.435+26.099+25.255+24.129+23.777+23.426+23.003\n          = 23.285+23.496=46.781\n          +23.003=69.784\n          +23.144=92.928\n          +22.933=115.861\n          +22.581=138.442\n          +22.581=161.023\n          +23.003=184.026\n          +22.792=206.818\n          +23.988=230.806\n          +24.762=255.568\n          +25.044=280.612\n          +26.028=306.64\n          +26.943=333.583\n          +27.013=360.596\n          +27.506=388.102\n          +27.576=415.678\n          +27.435=443.113\n          +26.099=469.212\n          +25.255=494.467\n          +24.129=518.596\n          +23.777=542.373\n          +23.426=565.799\n          +23.003=588.802\n\n          avg_day1 = 588.802 / 24 = 24.5334166667\n\n        Day2: \n          Sum_day2 = 22.511+22.23+22.37+20.612+21.667+21.315+21.526+21.456+21.737+21.174+19.908+18.501+16.321+15.476+17.516+17.446+16.883+14.914+16.461+16.039+13.788+14.843+15.265+14.843\n          = 22.511+22.23=44.741\n          +22.37=67.111\n          +20.612=87.723\n          +21.667=109.39\n          +21.315=130.705\n          +21.526=152.231\n          +21.456=173.687\n          +21.737=195.424\n          +21.174=216.598\n          +19.908=236.506\n          +18.501=255.007\n          +16.321=271.328\n          +15.476=286.804\n          +17.516=304.32\n          +17.446=321.766\n          +16.883=338.649\n          +14.914=353.563\n          +16.461=370.024\n          +16.039=386.063\n          +13.788=399.851\n          +14.843=414.694\n          +15.265=429.959\n          +14.843=444.802\n\n          avg_day2 = 444.802 / 24 = 18.5334166667\n\n        Day3:\n          Sum_day3 = 13.788+10.341+10.13+11.467+11.959+9.989+9.426+9.426+9.567+9.708+10.13+10.13+12.1+14.703+12.24+14.28+12.733+13.436+11.044+10.341+10.622+10.482+10.411+10.341\n          = 13.788+10.341=24.129\n          +10.13=34.259\n          +11.467=45.726\n          +11.959=57.685\n          +9.989=67.674\n          +9.426=77.1\n          +9.426=86.526\n          +9.567=96.093\n          +9.708=105.801\n          +10.13=115.931\n          +10.13=126.061\n          +12.1=138.161\n          +14.703=152.864\n          +12.24=165.104\n          +14.28=179.384\n          +12.733=192.117\n          +13.436=205.553\n          +11.044=216.597\n          +10.341=226.938\n          +10.622=237.56\n          +10.482=248.042\n          +10.411=258.453\n          +10.341=268.794\n\n          avg_day3 = 268.794 / 24 = 11.19975\n\n        Day4:\n          Sum_day4 = 10.482+11.467+10.693+13.577+11.256+11.326+11.889+11.044+10.341+12.733+16.039+15.687+15.758+15.758+16.954+16.602+16.602+16.954+18.009+18.783+18.712+18.431+18.994+18.572\n          = 10.482+11.467=21.949\n          +10.693=32.642\n          +13.577=46.219\n          +11.256=57.475\n          +11.326=68.801\n          +11.889=80.69\n          +11.044=91.734\n          +10.341=102.075\n          +12.733=114.808\n          +16.039=130.847\n          +15.687=146.534\n          +15.758=162.292\n          +15.758=178.05\n          +16.954=195.004\n          +16.602=211.606\n          +16.602=228.208\n          +16.954=245.162\n          +18.009=263.171\n          +18.783=281.954\n          +18.712=300.666\n          +18.431=319.097\n          +18.994=338.091\n          +18.572=356.663\n\n          avg_day4 = 356.663 / 24 = 14.8609583333\n\n   Now, we have the daily averages: [24.5334, 18.5334, 11.1998, 14.8610]\n\n   We can model the daily average with a linear regression? \n\n        Day: 1,2,3,4 -> x=[1,2,3,4], y=[24.5334, 18.5334, 11.1998, 14.8610]\n\n        We can fit a line: y = a + b*x\n\n        But note: the drop then rise. We might use a quadratic? But we have 4 points. We can do:\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a moving average or assume the next days will be around the last two days? \n\n        The last two days: day3=11.20, day4=14.86 -> increase of 3.66. We can project:\n\n          day5: 14.86 + 3.66 = 18.52\n          day6: 18.52 + 3.66 = 22.18\n          day7: 22.18 + 3.66 = 25.84\n          day8: 25.84 + 3.66 = 29.50\n\n        But that seems too high? And the increase might not be linear.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days as the base and then a smaller increment? \n\n        Or we can use exponential smoothing: \n\n          Let F4 = 14.8610, F3=11.1998\n\n          We can set F5 = alpha * F4 + (1-alpha)*F3? But that is for level without trend.\n\n        We can use Holt's linear trend:\n\n          We have:\n            Level: L4 = 14.8610\n            Trend: T4 = (14.8610 - 11.1998) = 3.6612\n\n          Then:\n            F5 = L4 + T4 = 14.8610 + 3.6612 = 18.5222\n            F6 = L4 + 2*T4 = 14.8610 + 2*3.6612 = 22.1834\n            F7 = 14.8610 + 3*3.6612 = 25.8446\n            F8 = 14.8610 + 4*3.6612 = 29.5058\n\n        But note: the trend might not be linear and we only have 4 days. We might dampen the trend? \n\n        However, the first day was 24.53, so we are projecting to exceed that on day7 and day8. That might be reasonable if the temperature is recovering.\n\n   Step 3: Compute the seasonal index for each hour.\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23), we compute:\n\n          index_h = ( (value_day1_h / avg_day1) + (value_day2_h / avg_day2) + (value_day3_h / avg_day3) + (value_day4_h / avg_day4) ) / 4\n\n        Then for a future day i (i=5,6,7,8) with average = F_i, the hour h is: F_i * index_h.\n\n   Step 4: Generate the 96 hours.\n\n   However, note: the data we are given ends at 2016-09-30 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n        2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00 (4 days)\n\n   We'll assign:\n\n        Day5: 2016-10-01, average = F5 = 18.5222\n        Day6: 2016-10-02, average = F6 = 22.1834\n        Day7: 2016-10-03, average = F7 = 25.8446\n        Day8: 2016-10-04, average = F8 = 29.5058\n\n   Now, we compute the seasonal indices:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the normalized values.\n\n        Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n\n          Day1: 23.285000 / 24.5334 = 0.9491\n          Day2: 22.511000 / 18.5334 = 1.2146\n          Day3: 13.788000 / 11.1998 = 1.2311\n          Day4: 10.482000 / 14.8610 = 0.7053\n\n          index0 = (0.9491 + 1.2146 + 1.2311 + 0.7053) / 4 = (4.1001)/4 = 1.025025\n\n        Similarly, we do for all 24.\n\n   But note: the sum of the indices over 24 hours should be 24? Actually, the average of the indices over a day should be 1.\n\n   We can compute the average of the indices and then adjust? But we'll compute all and then if the average is not 1, we can normalize? \n\n   However, we have 4 days, and the indices are computed as the average of the normalized values. The average of the indices for the 24 hours should be 1.\n\n   Let me check for the first hour: 1.025, which is above 1.\n\n   We'll compute all 24 and then check the average. If it's not 1, we can adjust by dividing each by the average of the indices? \n\n   But to save time, we'll assume it's approximately 1 and proceed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the indices and use the average of the absolute values? But that would not account for the level.\n\n   We'll compute the indices for each hour and then use them.\n\n   Due to the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the data, we will compute the indices for each hour and then multiply by the daily average.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        For day5 (2016-10-01) and hour0: OT = 18.5222 * 1.025025 = 18.99\n\n   But note: the indices we computed are from the past 4 days.
