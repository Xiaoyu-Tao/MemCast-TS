        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The data ranges from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n Since the data has missing values note, but in the provided 96 points there are no missing values, we assume that the next 96 might have some, but the problem asks for the complete data. \n However, the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\" \n So we must provide 96 data points without any missing values.\n\n Approach:\n We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, we can use a model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours cycle)\n   - Possibly a trend, but the data is only 4 days so trend might be hard to capture.\n\n However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern. For example, each day has a similar pattern: \n   - Values are higher during the day and lower at night? But let's look:\n\n   On 2016-08-06: \n       00:00: 1.492 -> then decreases until 03:00 (1.340), then increases at 07:00 (1.553), then decreases until 13:00 (0.975), then increases until 17:00 (1.218) and then decreases again.\n\n   Actually, the pattern is not very clear. We see multiple peaks and troughs in a day.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement for 96 points, we can use a simple method that captures the daily seasonality.\n\n Since we are not allowed to omit any content and must provide the complete data, we will generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We note that the data is at hourly frequency and we have 4 days (96 points). We can use a seasonal model with period 24.\n\n 2. We can use a simple seasonal naive method: \n        y_{t+1} = y_{t-23}   (because 24 hours before, same hour of previous day)\n\n    But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n 3. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days. However, note that we only have 4 days.\n\n 4. We can also use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). But with only 4 days, the seasonal parameters might be hard to estimate.\n\n 5. Given the simplicity and the fact that we must provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 available days.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-10 to 2016-08-13), we assign the average value for each hour.\n\n    However, this would ignore any trend. But the data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days? \n\n    Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n        2016-08-06: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        2016-08-07: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        2016-08-08: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        2016-08-09: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n\n    We can compute:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-08-06): \n            sum = 1.492+1.432+1.371+1.340+1.492+1.401+1.340+1.553+1.036+1.066+1.066+1.036+1.036+0.975+1.036+1.157+1.157+1.218+1.127+1.127+1.066+1.097+1.005+1.066\n            = 28.193\n\n        Day 2 (2016-08-07):\n            = 0.944+0.853+0.853+0.822+1.157+0.822+0.670+0.853+0.914+1.188+1.127+1.097+1.157+1.066+1.218+1.218+1.157+1.249+1.066+1.036+1.310+1.188+1.157+1.036\n            = 26.153\n\n        Day 3 (2016-08-08):\n            = 1.005+1.036+1.005+0.944+0.914+0.853+1.036+1.249+1.127+1.157+1.310+1.218+1.218+1.066+1.218+1.157+1.218+1.310+1.310+1.127+1.553+1.310+1.249+1.218\n            = 28.184\n\n        Day 4 (2016-08-09):\n            = 1.736+1.675+1.614+1.614+1.614+1.523+1.736+1.828+1.371+1.340+1.401+1.340+1.218+1.279+1.371+1.279+1.279+1.340+1.249+1.127+1.218+1.097+1.066+1.097\n            = 32.252\n\n    The daily averages: \n        Day1: 28.193 / 24 = 1.1747\n        Day2: 26.153 / 24 = 1.0897\n        Day3: 28.184 / 24 = 1.1743\n        Day4: 32.252 / 24 = 1.3438\n\n    There is an increasing trend? But note that the fourth day is higher. However, we don't have enough data to project a trend.\n\n 6. Considering the above, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to capture the seasonality and ignore the trend.\n\n    For hour 0: (1.492 + 0.944 + 1.005 + 1.736) / 4 = (1.177 + ...) -> we compute for each hour.\n\n 7. However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. \n    We are to forecast the next 96, and we are to provide complete data. So we will use the average of the same hour for the 4 days.\n\n 8. Steps for forecasting:\n\n        For hour h in [0, 23]:\n            value_h = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (day5 to day8, which are 2016-08-10 to 2016-08-13), we assign for each hour h the value_h.\n\n    But note: the next 4 days are 96 hours, so we will have 4 copies of the 24-hour average pattern.\n\n 9. However, we must generate the dates as well. The last date in the input is 2016-08-09 23:00:00. \n    The next 96 hours start at 2016-08-10 00:00:00 and end at 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n 10. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.492, 0.944, 1.005, 1.736) -> (1.492+0.944+1.005+1.736)/4 = 5.177/4 = 1.29425\n        hour1: (1.432, 0.853, 1.036, 1.675) -> (1.432+0.853+1.036+1.675)/4.996/4=1.249\n        hour2: (1.371,0.853,1.005,1.614) -> (1.371+0.853+1.005+1.614)=4.843/4=1.21075\n        hour3: (1.340,0.822,0.944,1.614) -> (1.340+0.822+0.944+1.614)=4.72/4=1.18\n        hour4: (1.492,1.157,0.914,1.614) -> (1.492+1.157+0.914+1.614)=5.177/4=1.29425\n        hour5: (1.401,0.822,0.853,1.523) -> (1.401+0.822+0.853+1.523)=4.599/4=1.14975\n        hour6: (1.340,0.670,1.036,1.736) -> (1.340+0.670+1.036+1.736)=4.782/4=1.1955\n        hour7: (1.553,0.853,1.249,1.828) -> (1.553+0.853+1.249+1.828)=5.483/4=1.37075\n        hour8: (1.036,0.914,1.127,1.371) -> (1.036+0.914+1.127+1.371)=4.448/4=1.112\n        hour9: (1.066,1.188,1.157,1.340) -> (1.066+1.188+1.157+1.340)=4.751/4=1.18775\n        hour10: (1.066,1.127,1.310,1.401) -> (1.066+1.127+1.310+1.401)=4.904/4=1.226\n        hour11: (1.036,1.097,1.218,1.340) -> (1.036+1.097+1.218+1.340)=4.691/4=1.17275\n        hour12: (1.036,1.157,1.218,1.218) -> (1.036+1.157+1.218+1.218)=4.629/4=1.15725\n        hour13: (0.975,1.066,1.066,1.279) -> (0.975+1.066+1.066+1.279)=4.386/4=1.0965\n        hour14: (1.036,1.218,1.218,1.371) -> (1.036+1.218+1.218+1.371)=4.843/4=1.21075\n        hour15: (1.157,1.218,1.157,1.279) -> (1.157+1.218+1.157+1.279)=4.811/4=1.20275\n        hour16: (1.157,1.157,1.218,1.279) -> (1.157+1.157+1.218+1.279)=4.811/4=1.20275\n        hour17: (1.218,1.249,1.310,1.340) -> (1.218+1.249+1.310+1.340)=5.117/4=1.27925\n        hour18: (1.127,1.066,1.310,1.249) -> (1.127+1.066+1.310+1.249)=4.752/4=1.188\n        hour19: (1.127,1.036,1.127,1.127) -> (1.127+1.036+1.127+1.127)=4.417/4=1.10425\n        hour20: (1.066,1.310,1.553,1.218) -> (1.066+1.310+1.553+1.218)=5.147/4=1.28675\n        hour21: (1.097,1.188,1.310,1.097) -> (1.097+1.188+1.310+1.097)=4.692/4=1.173\n        hour22: (1.005,1.157,1.249,1.066) -> (1.005+1.157+1.249+1.066)=4.477/4=1.11925\n        hour23: (1.066,1.036,1.218,1.097) -> (1.066+1.036+1.218+1.097)=4.417/4=1.10425\n\n 11. Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n        Day 5: 2016-08-10 \n            hour0: 1.29425\n            hour1: 1.249\n            ... until hour23: 1.10425\n\n        Day 6: 2016-08-11: same 24 values\n        Day 7: 2016-08-12: same 24 values\n        Day 8: 2016-08-13: same 24 values\n\n 12. However, note that the average might smooth out the pattern and we are not capturing the increasing trend on the last day. \n     But with only 4 days, it's hard to project the trend. Alternatively, we could use the last day (day4) as the pattern for the next days? \n     But the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and we don't have context of what is typical.\n\n 13. Given the instructions, we'll go with the average per hour.\n\n 14. Format: We must output the next 96 points in the same format as the input, with the date and the LULL value.\n\n 15. We'll generate the numbers rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 16. Let's compute the averages and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: 1.294\n        hour1: 1.249\n        hour2: 1.211\n        hour3: 1.180\n        hour4: 1.294\n        hour5: 1.150\n        hour6: 1.196\n        hour7: 1.371\n        hour8: 1.112\n        hour9: 1.188\n        hour10: 1.226\n        hour11: 1.173\n        hour12: 1.157\n        hour13: 1.097\n        hour14: 1.211\n        hour15: 1.203\n        hour16: 1.203\n        hour17: 1.279\n        hour18: 1.188\n        hour19: 1.104\n        hour20: 1.287\n        hour21: 1.173\n        hour22: 1.119\n        hour23: 1.104\n\n 17. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        date: starting from 2016-08-10 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n 18. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day 5: 2016-08-10: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 6: 2016-08-11: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 7: 2016-08-12: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 8: 2016-08-13: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 19. We'll assign the values for each hour as above.\n\n 20. Example for 2016-08-10 00:00:00: 1.294\n           2016-08-10 01:00:00: 1.249\n           ... and so on.\n\n 21. We'll write all 96 lines.\n\n 22. Note: The input data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 23. However, note that the average we computed might not be exactly the same as the input pattern, but it's a reasonable forecast.\n\n 24. We output in the required format.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n    We'll create a list of the 24 average values (rounded) in the order of the hour (0 to 23).\n\n    Then, for each day in the next 4 days (from 2016-08-10 to 2016-08-13), we assign the 24 values.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    base_date = datetime(2016, 8, 10)\n    for day in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n            value = avg[hour]   # the precomputed average for that hour\n\n 25. Format the date as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 26. We write the data in the same format: two columns: date and LULL (with the value)\n\n 27. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 28. Let's do it.\n\n But note: the input data had the index as the date string? We output without index.\n\n 29. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-08-10 00:00:00 <value>\n        2016-08-10 01:00:00 <value>\n        ...\n        2016-08-13 23:00:00 <value>\n        </answer>\n\n 30. We'll write the values with 3 decimal places.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 31. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n Let's compute the averages again and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n    We'll recalc to be precise:\n\n    hour0: (1.492+0.944+1.005+1.736)/4 = 5.177/4 = 1.29425 -> 1.294\n    hour1: (1.432+0.853+1.036+1.675)/4.996/4 -> 4.996/4=1.249 -> 1.249\n    hour2: (1.371+0.853+1.005+1.614)=4.843/4=1.21075 -> 1.211\n    hour3: (1.340+0.822+0.944+1.614)=4.72/4=1.18 -> 1.180\n    hour4: (1.492+1.157+0.914+1.614)=5.177/4=1.29425 -> 1.294\n    hour5: (1.401+0.822+0.853+1.523)=4.599/4=1.14975 -> 1.150\n    hour6: (1.340+0.670+1.036+1.736)=4.782/4=1.1955 -> 1.196\n    hour7: (1.553+0.853+1.249+1.828)=5.483/4=1.37075 -> 1.371\n    hour8: (1.036+0.914+1.127+1.371)=4.448/4=1.112 -> 1.112\n    hour9: (1.066+1.188+1.157+1.340)=4.751/4=1.18775 -> 1.188\n    hour10: (1.066+1.127+1.310+1.401)=4.904/4=1.226 -> 1.226\n    hour11: (1.036+1.097+1.218+1.340)=4.691/4=1.17275 -> 1.173\n    hour12: (1.036+1.157+1.218+1.218)=4.629/4=1.15725 -> 1.157\n    hour13: (0.975+1.066+1.066+1.279)=4.386/4=1.0965 -> 1.097\n    hour14: (1.036+1.218+1.218+1.371)=4.843/4=1.21075 -> 1.211\n    hour15: (1.157+1.218+1.157+1.279)=4.811/4=1.20275 -> 1.203\n    hour16: (1.157+1.157+1.218+1.279)=4.811/4=1.20275 -> 1.203\n    hour17: (1.218+1.249+1.310+1.340)=5.117/4=1.27925 -> 1.279\n    hour18: (1.127+1.066+1.310+1.249)=4.752/4=1.188 -> 1.188\n    hour19: (1.127+1.036+1.127+1.127)=4.417/4=1.10425 -> 1.104\n    hour20: (1.066+1.310+1.553+1.218)=5.147/4=1.28675 -> 1.287\n    hour21: (1.097+1.188+1.310+1.097)=4.692/4=1.173 -> 1.173\n    hour22: (1.005+1.157+1.249+1.066)=4.477/4=1.11925 -> 1.119\n    hour23: (1.066+1.036+1.218+1.097)=4.417/4=1.10425 -> 1.104\n\n 32. Now, we write the data.\n\n 33. We note that the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-08-10 (Wednesday) to 2016-08-13 (Saturday) -> but we don't have weekday info in the data.\n\n 34.

We'll write 4 days? Actually 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n 36. We do the same for 2016-08-11, 2016-08-12, 2016-08-13.\n\n 37. We output in the required format.\n\n Let's write the code in our mind to generate the dates and values.\n\n 38. We are ready.\n",
