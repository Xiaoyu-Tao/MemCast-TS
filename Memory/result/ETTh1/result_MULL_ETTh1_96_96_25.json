        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-10-13 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing value warning, but the provided 96 points do not have any missing values in the given sample.\n    However, we must be cautious and handle any potential missing values in the data we are going to forecast? \n    the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" but the provided 96 points are complete. \n    Since we are forecasting, we are generating the next 96 points. We are not given any missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points. We can use a time series model. Given the hourly data and the seasonality, we might see daily patterns (24 hours) and weekly patterns (168 hours) but we only have 4 days of data, so weekly pattern is not visible.\n\n 3. We can use a model that can capture seasonality. Since we have only 96 points, we can use a simple model like:\n    - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with a seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n 4. However, note that the data does not show a clear trend but does show daily seasonality. Let's check the data: \n    - The values range between about 0.959 and 4.193.\n    - Each day has a pattern: higher values at the beginning and end of the day, and lower in the middle? \n      But looking at the provided 4 days, the pattern is not exactly the same.\n\n 5. Given the small data size, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal component (SARIMA). But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be hard to fit.\n\n 7. Considering the requirement to provide 96 points and the simplicity, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n 8. We'll use ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels with a seasonal period of 24 and trend and seasonal components.\n\n 9. However, note that the data might have non-constant variance or non-constant mean? We can try to fit a model.\n\n 10. But note: the last day (2016-10-12) has a value of 1.457 at 23:00, which is lower than the previous days at the same hour.\n\n 11. Since we are required to provide the complete data and the problem says there are missing values in the data (though the provided 96 are complete), \n     we assume that the provided data is clean for modeling.\n\n 12. We will use the Holt-Winters method (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n 13. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Fit an ExponentialSmoothing model on the 96 points with seasonal_periods=24, trend='add', seasonal='add'.\n     - Forecast next 96 steps.\n\n 14. However, we are not coding but we have to produce the forecast. We cannot run code? We have to simulate the output.\n\n 15. But note: the problem says \"You are an expert\", so we must use our expertise to generate a reasonable forecast.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the average of the same hour from the previous 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Example for 00:00: \n        Day1: 3.873, Day2: 3.944, Day3: 3.802, Day4: 2.381 -> average = (3.873+3.944+3.802+2.381)/4 = 3.5\n\n    But note: the last day (2016-10-12) at 00:00 is 2.381, which is an outlier? \n\n 17. We can also that the pattern is changing. Another idea: use the last day (2016-10-12) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 18. However, the problem does not specify the method. We must provide 96 numbers.\n\n 19. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the data without running actual code, we can generate a forecast by:\n\n     - Taking the average of each hour across the 4 days and then using that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n     But note: the data for 2016-10-12 is incomplete? Actually, we have 24 hours for each day? \n        Day1: 2016-10-09 (24 hours)\n        Day2: 2016-10-10 (24 hours)\n        Day3: 2016-10-11 (24 hours)\n        Day4: 2016-10-12 (24 hours)\n\n     So we have 4 full days.\n\n 20. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-10-13 to 2016-10-16) will be the same as the average day.\n\n 21. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00: (3.873 + 3.944 + 3.802 + 2.381) / 4 = 3.5\n        But wait, the last day (2016-10-12) at 00:00 is 2.381, which is low. So the average is (3.873+3.944+3.802+2.381)= 14.0 -> 14.0/4=3.5\n\n     Hour 01: (3.553 + 3.553 + 2.559 + 2.452) / 4 = (3.553+3.553=7.106; 7.106+2.559=9.665; 9.665+2.452=12.117) -> 12.117/4=3.02925\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 22. Then the forecast for 2016-10-13 00:00:00 would be 3.5, 2016-10-13 01:00:00 would be 3.02925, etc.\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not told which ones are missing. But the provided 96 are complete.\n\n 24. However, the average might smooth out the pattern. But we are forecasting 4 days, so we will repeat the same average day 4 times.\n\n 25. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 26. Alternatively, we could use the median? But the problem does not specify.\n\n 27. We choose the average because it is common.\n\n 28. Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n     - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), assign the hour 0 average to the 00:00 of each day, hour 1 average to 01:00, etc.\n\n 29. We must generate the dates: starting from 2016-10-13 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     Hour 00: [3.873, 3.944, 3.802, 2.381] -> 3.5\n     Hour 01: [3.553, 3.553, 2.559, 2.452] -> (3.553+3.553+2.559+2.452)/4 = 12.117/4 = 3.02925\n     Hour 02: [2.132, 2.665, 3.127, 2.701] -> (2.132+2.665+3.127+2.701)/4 = 10.625/4 = 2.65625\n     Hour 03: [3.376, 3.305, 2.203, 2.772] -> (3.376+3.305+2.203+2.772)/4 = 11.656/4 = 2.914\n     Hour 04: [3.411, 3.020, 2.310, 2.949] -> (3.411+3.020+2.310+2.949)/4 = 11.69/4 = 2.9225\n     Hour 05: [3.767, 2.878, 2.132, 3.127] -> (3.767+2.878+2.132+3.127)/4 = 11.904/4 = 2.976\n     Hour 06: [3.838, 3.127, 1.635, 1.741] -> (3.838+3.127+1.635+1.741)/4 = 10.341/4 = 2.58525\n     Hour 07: [3.518, 3.447, 1.599, 2.452] -> (3.518+3.447+1.599+2.452)/4 = 11.016/4 = 2.754\n     Hour 08: [4.193, 2.985, 3.127, 2.772] -> (4.193+2.985+3.127+2.772)/4 = 13.077/4 = 3.26925\n     Hour 09: [2.381, 3.092, 1.741, 2.310] -> (2.381+3.092+1.741+2.310)/4 = 9.524/4 = 2.381\n     Hour 10: [2.523, 2.736, 2.132, 2.381] -> (2.523+2.736+2.132+2.381)/4 = 9.772/4 = 2.443\n     Hour 11: [2.310, 2.736, 2.025, 2.559] -> (2.310+2.736+2.025+2.559)/4 = 9.63/4 = 2.4075\n     Hour 12: [1.635, 2.203, 1.208, 1.919] -> (1.635+2.203+1.208+1.919)/4 = 6.965/4 = 1.74125\n     Hour 13: [2.025, 2.025, 2.274, 2.452] -> (2.025+2.025+2.274+2.452)/4 = 8.776/4 = 2.194\n     Hour 14: [1.883, 2.168, 1.777, 2.701] -> (1.883+2.168+1.777+2.701)/4 = 8.529/4 = 2.13225\n     Hour 15: [1.741, 2.487, 1.848, 2.665] -> (1.741+2.487+1.848+2.665)/4 = 8.741/4 = 2.18525\n     Hour 16: [1.777, 2.239, 2.061, 1.635] -> (1.777+2.239+2.061+1.635)/4 = 7.712/4 = 1.928\n     Hour 17: [1.919, 1.919, 1.812, 1.954] -> (1.919+1.919+1.812+1.954)/4 = 7.604/4 = 1.901\n     Hour 18: [1.528, 1.635, 1.564, 1.244] -> (1.528+1.635+1.564+1.244)/4 = 5.971/4 = 1.49275\n     Hour 19: [1.386, 1.421, 1.457, 1.457] -> (1.386+1.421+1.457+1.457)/4 = 5.721/4 = 1.43025\n     Hour 20: [1.457, 1.315, 1.421, 1.812] -> (1.457+1.315+1.421+1.812)/4 = 6.005/4 = 1.50125\n     Hour 21: [0.959, 1.315, 1.315, 1.031] -> (0.959+1.315+1.315+1.031)/4 = 4.62/4 = 1.155\n     Hour 22: [2.381, 2.843, 1.421, 2.914] -> (2.381+2.843+1.421+2.914)/4 = 9.559/4 = 2.38975\n     Hour 23: [3.767, 3.376, 2.630, 1.457] -> (3.767+3.376+2.630+1.457)/4 = 11.23/4 = 2.8075\n\n 31. Now, for the next 4 days (2016-10-13 to 2016-10-16), we assign:\n\n     2016 (2016-10-13): [3.5, 3.02925, 2.65625, 2.914, 2.9225, 2.976, 2.58525, 2.754, 3.26925, 2.381, 2.443, 2.4075, 1.74125, 2.194, 2.13225, 2.18525, 1.928, 1.901, 1.49275, 1.43025, 1.50125, 1.155, 2.38975, 2.8075]\n     2016-10-14: same 24 numbers\n     2016-10-15: same\n     2016-10-16: same\n\n 32. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are generating a complete forecast without missing values.\n\n 33. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: date and MULL, with the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-10-13 00:00:00\n     Then 2016-10-13 01:00:00 ... up to 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n\n 35. We have 4 days? Actually 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n 36. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 37. However, we must note that the average method might not be the most accurate, but it is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 38. We output the numbers with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 39. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n     Hour 00: 3.5 -> 3.500\n     Hour 01: 3.02925 -> 3.029\n     ... \n\n 40. We must be cautious: the input had 3 decimal places, so we should output 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. We recalc with rounding to 3 decimal places:\n\n     Hour 00: 3.500\n     Hour 01: 3.029\n     Hour 02: 2.656\n     Hour 03: 2.914\n     Hour 04: 2.923   (because 2.9225 rounded to 3 decimals is 2.923)\n     Hour 05: 2.976\n     Hour 06: 2.585\n     Hour 07: 2.754\n     Hour 08: 3.269\n     Hour 09: 2.381\n     Hour 10: 2.443\n     Hour 11: 2.408   (2.4075 -> 2.408)\n     Hour 12: 1.741\n     Hour 13: 2.194\n     Hour 14: 2.132\n     Hour 15: 2.185\n     Hour 16: 1.928\n     Hour 17: 1.901\n     Hour 18: 1.493   (1.49275 -> 1.493)\n     Hour 19: 1.430\n     Hour 20: 1.501\n     Hour 21: 1.155\n     Hour 22: 2.390   (2.38975 -> 2.390)\n     Hour 23: 2.808   (2.8075 -> 2.808)\n\n 42. Now we generate the next 96 points:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-10-13\n        00:00:00 -> 3.500\n        01:00:00 -> 3.029\n        02:00:00 -> 2.656\n        03:00:00 -> 2.914\n        04:00:00 -> 2.923\n        05:00:00 -> 2.976\n        06:00:00 -> 2.585\n        07:00:00 -> 2.754\n        08:00:00 -> 3.269\n        09:00:00 -> 2.381\n        10:00:00 -> 2.443\n        11:00:00 -> 2.408\n        12:00:00 -> 1.741\n        13:00:00 -> 2.194\n        14:00:00 -> 2.132\n        15:00:00 -> 2.185\n        16:00:00 -> 1.928\n        17:00:00 -> 1.901\n        18:00:00 -> 1.493\n        19:00:00 -> 1.430\n        20:00:00 -> 1.501\n        21:00:00 -> 1.155\n        22:00:00 -> 2.390\n        23:00:00 -> 2.808\n\n     Then repeat the same for 2016-10-14, 2016-10-15, 2016-10-16.\n\n 43. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 44. Note: the input data had the date as index without the index numbers (like the first row was \"2016-10-09 00:00:00 3.873\", without the index 0,1,2...). \n     So we output without an index.\n\n 45. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-13 00:00:00 3.500\n2016-10-13 01:00:00 3.029\n2016-10-13 02:00:00 2.656\n... (until 2016-10-16 23:00:00)\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 46. We generate 96 lines.\n\n 47. Let's write the first day and then repeat.\n\n 48. We must be cautious: the dates are in the order.\n\n 49. We output:\n\n     First 24 hours: 2016-10-13 00:00:00 to 2016-10-13 23:00:00 with the 24 values above.\n     Then 2016-10-14 00:00:00 to 2016-10-14 23:00:00: same 24 values.\n     Then 2016-10-15: same.\n     Then 2016-10-16: same.\n\n 50. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 51. We note that the method is very simple and might not capture trends, but with only 4 days of data, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 52. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 53. We must not omit any content.\n\n 54. We write the answer in the required format.\n",
