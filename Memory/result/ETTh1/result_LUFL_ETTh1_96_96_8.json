        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (4 days * 24 hours) of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) data starting from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with 24-hour cycles.\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided past data does not have any missing values in the given snippet.\n 3. We will generate forecasts for the next 96 time points (from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to provide a forecast for the data, and we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a simple method that captures the seasonality.\n One straightforward method is to use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days (since we have exactly 4 days of data) to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend or other patterns, but with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a weekly pattern. We'll assume the pattern repeats daily.\n\n Proposed method:\n For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour across the 4 available days. Then we use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n Steps in detail:\n - We have 4 days: Day1 (2016-08-02), Day2 (2016-08-03), Day3 (2016-08-04), Day4 (2016-08-05).\n - For hour 0: average of [7.219, 2.924, 1.919, 2.132] -> (7.219+2.924+1.919+2.132)/4 = 3.5485\n - Similarly for hour 1: average of [6.671, 2.741, 2.163, 2.102] -> (6.671+2.741+2.163+2.102)/4 = 3.41925\n - ... and so on for each of the 24 hours.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2016-08-06 to 2016-08-09), we assign:\n   Day5 (2016-08-06): hour0 = 3.5485, hour1 = 3.41925, ... hour23 = average of the 4 previous day's hour23.\n   Day6 (2016-08-07): same as Day5? But note: we are using the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided past, there are none. We are only forecasting, so we don't have to impute past missing values.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the future data we are forecasting might have missing values? \n However, the instruction is to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must provide 96 values without any missing.\n\n Therefore, we will generate 96 values by repeating the daily pattern we computed (the 24-hour profile) for the next 4 days.\n\n Let's compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n Hour 0 (00:00): [7.219, 2.924, 1.919, 2.132] -> 3.5485\n Hour 1 (01:00): [6.671, 2.741, 2.163, 2.102] -> 3.41925\n Hour 2 (02:00): [6.396, 2.315, 1.949, 2.041] -> 3.17525\n Hour 3 (03:00): [6.214, 2.132, 1.980, 2.071] -> 3.09925\n Hour 4 (04:00): [5.726, 2.132, 1.706, 2.010] -> 2.8935\n Hour 5 (05:00): [5.665, 2.224, 2.254, 2.224] -> 3.09175\n Hour 6 (06:00): [5.726, 2.650, 2.650, 2.437] -> 3.36575\n Hour 7 (07:00): [4.904, 2.315, 2.467, 2.619] -> 3.07625\n Hour 8 (08:00): [3.290, 2.437, 2.467, 2.650] -> 2.711\n Hour 9 (09:00): [3.442, 2.772, 2.224, 2.955] -> 2.84825\n Hour 10 (10:00): [4.386, 2.680, 2.863, 3.320] -> 3.31225\n Hour 11 (11:00): [4.782, 2.955, 3.594, 3.442] -> 3.69325\n Hour 12 (12:00): [4.873, 2.376, 2.711, 2.772] -> 3.183\n Hour 13 (13:00): [4.752, 2.467, 2.315, 2.863] -> 3.09925\n Hour 14 (14:00): [4.173, 2.498, 2.254, 2.437] -> 2.8405\n Hour 15 (15:00): [3.716, 2.437, 2.406, 2.315] -> 2.7185\n Hour 16 (16:00): [3.807, 2.376, 2.315, 2.589] -> 2.77175\n Hour 17 (17:00): [3.564, 3.046, 2.559, 3.046] -> 3.05375\n Hour 18 (18:00): [2.985, 2.955, 2.863, 2.802] -> 2.90125\n Hour 19 (19:00): [3.168, 2.619, 2.772, 2.589] -> 2.787\n Hour 20 (20:00): [4.569, 3.411, 3.564, 3.229] -> 3.69325\n Hour 21 (21:00): [4.142, 2.955, 3.350, 2.924] -> 3.34275\n Hour 22 (22:00): [3.625, 2.376, 2.833, 2.711] -> 2.88625\n Hour 23 (23:00): [3.320, 2.467, 2.498, 2.437] -> 2.6805\n\n Now, we will use these 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n The next 96 dates (hourly) start from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate:\n  2016-08-06 00:00:00: 3.5485\n  2016-08-06 01:00:00: 3.41925\n  ... and so on for the 24 hours of August 6.\n\n Then for August 7, we use the same 24 numbers again, and so on.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast, so we are not going to have missing values in our forecast? \n We are to provide the complete data, so we will output 96 values without any missing.\n\n But let's round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that the pattern might change slightly? But with only 4 days, we don't have much to go on. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n Let's compute the averages and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n Hour0: 3.5485 -> 3.548\n Hour1: 3.41925 -> 3.419\n Hour2: 3.17525 -> 3.175\n Hour3: 3.09925 -> 3.099\n Hour4: 2.8935 -> 2.894\n Hour5: 3.09175 -> 3.092\n Hour6: 3.36575 -> 3.366\n Hour7: 3.07625 -> 3.076\n Hour8: 2.711 -> 2.711\n Hour9: 2.84825 -> 2.848\n Hour10: 3.31225 -> 3.312\n Hour11: 3.69325 -> 3.693\n Hour12: 3.183 -> 3.183\n Hour13: 3.09925 -> 3.099\n Hour14: 2.8405 -> 2.841\n Hour15: 2.7185 -> 2.718\n Hour16: 2.77175 -> 2.772\n Hour17: 3.05375 -> 3.054\n Hour18: 2.90125 -> 2.901\n Hour19: 2.787 -> 2.787\n Hour20: 3.69325 -> 3.693\n Hour21: 3.34275 -> 3.343\n Hour22: 2.88625 -> 2.886\n Hour23: 2.6805 -> 2.681\n\n Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n Day1: 2016-08-06: [3.548, 3.419, 3.175, 3.099, 2.894, 3.092, 3.366, 3.076, 2.711, 2.848, 3.312, 3.693, 3.183, 3.099, 2.841, 2.718, 2.772, 3.054, 2.901, 2.787, 3.693, 3.343, 2.886, 2.681]\n Day2: 2016-08-07: same 24 numbers\n Day3: 2016-08-08: same\n Day4: 2016-08-09: same\n\n But note: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n The last date in the input is 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n The next date is 2016-08-06 00:00:00, then 2016-08-06 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data is sampled hourly or every 15 minutes. The given data is hourly (only one record per hour). So we continue hourly.\n\n Let's write the data in the required format.\n\n Important: The answer must be enclosed in <answer> and </answer> tags, and the data must be in the same format as the input (with the date and LUFL value).\n\n Example of one line: \"2016-08-06 00:00:00 3.548\"\n\n We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n But note: the input had 3 decimal places, so we'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n However, our computed averages are already rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n Start: 2016-08-06 00:00:00\n Then add one hour until we have 96 records.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n 2016-08-06 00:00:00 3.548\n 2016-08-06 01:00:00 3.419\n ... and so on.\n\n But note: the input had the date format as \"2016-08-02 00:00:00\" (with a space and no 'T').\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the next day in the input was 2016-08-03, so we are starting at 2016-08-06.\n\n We'll use Python-like pseudocode to generate the dates, but we are writing the output.\n\n Steps for the next 96 hours:\n\n for day_offset in range(0,4):   # 4 days\n   for hour in range(0,24):      # 24 hours per day\n        date = start_date + day_offset days and set hour\n        value = pattern[hour]\n\n Start date: 2016-08-06 00:00:00\n\n We have to be careful: August has 31 days, so after 2016-08-05 comes 2016-08-06, then 07, 08, 09.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n Day 0: 2016-08-06\n Day 1: 2016-08-07\n Day 2: 2016-08-08\n Day 3: 2016-08-09\n\n Now, we write the data.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not seeing any in the past, and we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n We are providing 96 values without any missing.\n\n Let's write the output in the required format.\n",
