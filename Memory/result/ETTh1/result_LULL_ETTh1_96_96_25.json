        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-10-13 00:00:00 to 2016-10-16 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series structure with hourly frequency.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided data we don't see any (we have 24*4=96 points). However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We need to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data shows a daily pattern (24-hour cycle), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, as an AI, we cannot run code but we can use a statistical method. Given the constraints, we can use a simple seasonal method.\n\n One simple method is the seasonal naive method: \n    Forecast for each hour in the next day is the value of the same hour in the last available day.\n\n But note: the last available day is 2016-10-12. However, we have 4 days of data. We can also consider averaging the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n However, we observe that the pattern is not exactly the same. For example, the first day (2016-10-09) and the last day (2016-10-12) are different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n Let's break the data into days:\n\n Day 1: 2016-10-09 (24 points)\n Day 2: 2016-10-10\n Day 3: 2016-10-11\n Day 4: 2016-10-12\n\n For each hour (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n But note: the data for 2016-10-12 has some very low values (e.g., 0.274 at 16:00) which might be an outlier? \n\n However, without more context, we'll use the average.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days (which are 4*24=96 hours), we set:\n        forecast_hour_h = average of the h-th hour of the 4 days we have.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are consecutive and we are to forecast 96 hours starting from 2016-10-13 00:00:00.\n\n However, for 00:00:00 of 2016-10-13, we take the average of:\n        2016-10-09 00:00:00 -> 0.670\n        2016-10-10 00:00:00 -> 1.249\n        2016-10-11 00:00:00 -> 0.579\n        2016-10-12 00:00:00 -> 1.310\n\n        average = (0.670 + 1.249 + 0.579 + 1.310) / 4 = 3.808 / 4 = 0.952\n\n Similarly, we do for every hour.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to see a trend (only 4 days). So we ignore trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-12) as the pattern for the next day? But the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", so maybe it's decreasing? However, without more context, the average is a safe bet.\n\n However, let's check the overall pattern: \n   The values on 2016-10-12 are generally lower than the previous days? \n\n We can also consider using a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Since the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and the last day (2016-10-12) has the lowest values, we might want to give more weight to the last day? \n\n But without clear trend, we stick to simple average.\n\n However, note that the data has a clear daily pattern. We'll compute the average for each hour.\n\n Let's create a table for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: [0.670, 1.249, 0.579, 1.310] -> avg = (0.670+1.249+0.579+1.310)/4 = 0.952\n Hour 1: [0.670, 1.310, 0.518, 1.249] -> (0.670+1.310+0.518+1.249)/4 = 0.93675\n Hour 2: [0.701, 1.401, 0.579, 1.249] -> (0.701+1.401+0.579+1.249)/4 = 0.9825\n Hour 3: [0.731, 1.371, 0.518, 1.157] -> (0.731+1.371+0.518+1.157)/4 = 0.94425\n Hour 4: [0.731, 1.340, 0.609, 1.157] -> (0.731+1.340+0.609+1.157)/4 = 0.95925\n Hour 5: [0.761, 1.371, 0.640, 1.218] -> (0.761+1.371+0.640+1.218)/4 = 0.9975\n Hour 6: [0.822, 1.401, 0.701, 1.279] -> (0.822+1.401+0.701+1.279)/4 = 1.05075\n Hour 7: [0.853, 1.492, 0.822, 1.432] -> (0.853+1.492+0.822+1.432)/4 = 1.14975\n Hour 8: [1.127, 1.127, 1.097, 0.670] -> (1.127+1.127+1.097+0.670)/4 = 1.00525\n Hour 9: [1.005, 1.157, 1.157, 0.670] -> (1.005+1.157+1.157+0.670)/4 = 0.99725\n Hour 10: [1.005, 1.036, 1.005, 0.518] -> (1.005+1.036+1.005+0.518)/4 = 0.891\n Hour 11: [0.975, 0.914, 0.975, 0.548] -> (0.975+0.914+0.975+0.548)/4 = 0.853\n Hour 12: [0.731, 0.944, 0.883, 0.457] -> (0.731+0.944+0.883+0.457)/4 = 0.75375\n Hour 13: [0.853, 1.127, 0.944, 0.426] -> (0.853+1.127+0.944+0.426)/4 = 0.8375\n Hour 14: [0.822, 1.005, 1.005, 0.426] -> (0.822+1.005+1.005+0.426)/4 = 0.8145\n Hour 15: [0.853, 1.036, 0.975, 0.366] -> (0.853+1.036+0.975+0.366)/4 = 0.8075\n Hour 16: [0.609, 1.097, 1.005, 0.274] -> (0.609+1.097+1.005+0.274)/4 = 0.74625\n Hour 17: [0.761, 1.066, 1.036, 0.335] -> (0.761+1.066+1.036+0.335)/4 = 0.7995\n Hour 18: [0.548, 0.975, 0.822, 0.518] -> (0.548+0.975+0.822+0.518)/4 = 0.71575\n Hour 19: [0.548, 0.792, 0.670, 0.548] -> (0.548+0.792+0.670+0.548)/4 = 0.6395\n Hour 20: [0.548, 0.701, 0.640, 0.518] -> (0.548+0.701+0.640+0.518)/4 = 0.60175\n Hour 21: [0.548, 0.579, 0.640, 0.518] -> (0.548+0.579+0.640+0.518)/4 = 0.57125\n Hour 22: [0.609, 0.670, 0.548, 0.426] -> (0.609+0.670+0.548+0.426)/4 = 0.56325\n Hour 23: [0.822, 0.640, 0.822, 0.518] -> (0.822+0.640+0.822+0.518)/4 = 0.7005\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2016-10-13 to 2016-10-16), we assign:\n   Day 1 (2016-10-13): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... , hour23_avg]\n   Day 2 (2016-10-14): same as above\n   Day 3 (2016-10-15): same as above\n   Day 4 (2016-10-16): same as above\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided data we don't have missing values. \n and we are forecasting for the next 96 hours without gaps.\n\n However, we are to be cautious: if the data had missing values we would have to handle them, but the provided data is complete.\n\n Therefore, we generate 96 points by repeating the 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-10-13 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-10-13 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-16 23:00:00.\n\n We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   dates = []\n   start_date = datetime(2016,10,13,0,0,0)\n   for day in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n            # format as string: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   But note: the input data format is \"2016-10-09 00:00:00\"\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        2016-10-13 00:00:00 -> 0.952\n        2016-10-13 01:00:00 -> 0.93675\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for the next day, same pattern.\n\n However, note: the pattern is the same for each day? Yes, because we are using the same 24 averages for each day.\n\n But we must note: the problem does not to omit any content, so we must output 96 lines.\n\n Let's write the data:\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, the input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Example: 0.952 -> 0.952, 0.93675 -> 0.937 (if we round to 3 decimals)\n\n   Rounding: \n        0.93675 -> 0.937\n        0.9825 -> 0.983\n        0.94425 -> 0.944\n        0.95925 -> 0.959\n        0.9975 -> 0.998\n        1.05075 -> 1.051\n        1.14975 -> 1.150\n        1.00525 -> 1.005\n        0.99725 -> 0.997\n        0.891 -> 0.891\n        0.853 -> 0.853\n        0.75375 -> 0.754\n        0.8375 -> 0.838\n        0.8145 -> 0.814\n        0.8075 -> 0.808\n        0.74625 -> 0.746\n        0.7995 -> 0.800\n        0.71575 -> 0.716\n        0.6395 -> 0.640\n        0.60175 -> 0.602\n        0.57125 -> 0.571\n        0.56325 -> 0.563\n        0.7005 -> 0.701\n\n   Then for each day we use these 24 values.\n\n   So the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1 (2016-10-13): \n            00:00:00 -> 0.952 -> rounded to 0.952? But we rounded above to 0.952? Actually, 0.952 is already 3 decimals.\n\n        But note: we computed the averages and then rounded.
