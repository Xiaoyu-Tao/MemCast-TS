        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data will have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing entries? Let's check: \n    The data starts at 2016-08-02 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-08-05 23:00:00, which is 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points. So the given data is complete? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious.\n\n 2. Since the problem says the data will have missing values, we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, we have to:\n    - First, handle any missing values in the provided data? But the provided 96 points are complete? \n    - However, the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and then we have to forecast the next 96. And note: \"these data will have missing values\". So it's possible that in the provided 96 points there are missing values? But in the example given, we see 96 consecutive hours without gaps.\n\n 3. Let me re-read: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then the data is provided. The data provided does not have any missing entries? It has 96 rows. So we can assume the provided 96 are complete? But the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning that in general the data has missing values? But in this particular snippet, there are none? \n\n 4. Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", we must design a method that can handle missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. So for the forecasting, we can proceed with the need to impute if we encounter missing values? But the forecast is for the next 96, which we don't have.\n\n 5. Approach for forecasting:\n    We are to forecast 96 points ahead. We can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and we have only 96 points (4 days), we can observe:\n    - There seems to be a daily pattern? Let's look at the data: \n        For example, on 2016-08-02: \n          00:00: 0.355, then 0.711, 0.817, 1.990, ... ) \n        We see that the values are varying.\n\n    However, 4 days is a very short history. We might use:\n        - ARIMA (with possible seasonal component) \n        - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) \n        - Or a simple model like a seasonal naive, but we have to forecast 4 days ahead and we have 4 days of history.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the short history, we might consider:\n    - Using a model that captures seasonality with a cycle of 24 hours.\n\n 7. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n    a. Check for missing values in the provided data and impute if necessary (but in this provided data, there are none).\n    b. Decompose the time series to see trend and seasonality.\n    c. Fit a model: given the seasonality, we can use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 8. However, we are not coding but we have to produce the forecast. Since we are an expert, we can simulate the process.\n\n 9. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" for the next 96 dates. We have to generate 96 numbers.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we can only use the provided 96 points. We note that the data has:\n      - A daily pattern: the values at night (e.g., around 00:00 to 05:00) are relatively lower? Actually, looking at the data, the pattern is not very consistent. For example:\n          Day1 (08-02): \n            00:00: 0.355, 01:00:0.711, 02:00:0.817, 03:00:1.990, 04:00:2.381, 05:00:2.132, ... \n          Day2 (08-03):\n            00:00:1.599, 01:00:1.421, 02:00:0.355, 03:00:0.000, 04:00:0.142, 05:00:-0.959, ...\n          Day3 (08-04):\n            00:00:2.736, 01:00:3.056, 02:00:3.411, 03:00:3.020, 04:00:2.310, 05:00:2.310, ...\n          Day4 (08-05):\n            00:00:4.691, 01:00:3.767, 02:00:4.904, 03:00:3.980, 04:00:4.300, 05:00:3.980, ...\n\n      It's hard to see a clear daily pattern. Also, the values are not strictly increasing or decreasing.\n\n 11. Given the short history, we might use a naive seasonal method: using the last day (day4: 2016-08-05) as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n      But note: the next 96 hours are 4 days. So we can repeat the last day 4 times? \n\n      However, the last day (2016-08-05) has 24 hours. We can use:\n          forecast for 2016-08-06 00:00:00 = value of 2016-08-05 00:00:00 (which is 4.691)\n          forecast for 2016-08-06 01:00:00 = value of 2016-08-05 01:00:00 (which is 3.767)\n          ... and so on.\n\n      Then for the next day (2016-08-07) we use the same day (2016-08-05) again? \n\n      But note: the problem says the data has missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide complete data.\n\n 12. However, the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all in the same week? from Tuesday to Friday). The next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? So the pattern might be different? But we don't have data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour? \n      For example, for the hour 00:00:00, we have 4 values: \n          2016-08-02 00:00:00: 0.355\n          2016-08-03 00:00:00: 1.599\n          2016-08-04 00:00:00: 2.736\n          2016-08-05 00:00:00: 4.691\n      The average = (0.355+1.599+2.736+4.691)/4 = 9.381/4 = 2.34525\n\n      Then for the next 4 days, we would use the same set of 24 averages? \n\n      But note: the data shows an increasing trend? The 00:00 values are increasing: 0.355, 1.599, 2.736, 4.691 -> so the average might be too low for the first forecasted day and too high for the last? \n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are limited to 96 points, we might use a simple method: \n      - Use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the trend and then add the daily seasonality.\n\n 15. However, without being able to run code, we have to make a judgment.\n\n 16. Considering the instructions and the need to provide a complete answer, we decide to use the last observed day (2016-08-05) as the pattern for the next 4 days? Why?\n      - It is the most recent and might capture the current level of the series.\n\n      But note: the last day (2016-08-05) has a higher level than the previous days? \n        For example, 00:00: 4.691 vs the previous days: 0.355, 1.599, 2.736 -> so it's increasing.\n\n      We might adjust by the trend? But we don't have enough data to compute a reliable trend.\n\n 17. Another idea: use the average of the last 24 hours (the last day) and then project that forward for 4 days? \n\n      So the forecast for the next 96 hours is the last 24 hours repeated 4 times.\n\n      Specifically:\n        The last 24 hours are from 2016-08-05 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n\n      We will assign:\n        2016-08-06 00:00:00 = 4.691\n        2016-08-06 01:00:00 = 3.767\n        ... until 2016-08-06 23:00:00 = 3.411\n\n        Then 2016-08-07 00:00:00 = 4.691\n        ... and so on.\n\n 18. This is a seasonal naive forecast with season length 24, using the last available season.\n\n 19. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? In the provided 96 points we don't have any, so we can use the last 24 points.\n\n 20. However, if in the future we had missing values, we would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we should handle missing values in the provided data? But the provided data is complete. So we proceed.\n\n 21. We generate the next 96 hours by repeating the last 24 hours 4 times.\n\n 22. The dates: \n        Start: 2016-08-06 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-08-05 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-08-06 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n 23. The last 24 hours (from 2016-08-05 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00) are:\n\n        2016-08-05 00:00:00  4.691\n        2016-08-05 01:00:00  3.767\n        2016-08-05 02:00:00  4.904\n        2016-08-05 03:00:00  3.980\n        2016-08-05 04:00:00  4.300\n        2016-08-05 05:00:00  3.980\n        2016-08-05 06:00:00  4.442\n        2016-08-05 07:00:00  4.833\n        2016-08-05 08:00:00  4.264\n        2016-08-05 09:00:00  3.376\n        2016-08-05 10:00:00  3.198\n        2016-08-05 11:00:00  3.411\n        2016-08-05 12:00:00  2.630\n        2016-08-05 13:00:00  2.274\n        2016-08-05 14:00:00  2.843\n        2016-08-05 15:00:00  2.203\n        2016-08-05 16:00:00  2.630\n        2016-08-05 17:00:00  2.843\n        2016-08-05 18:00:00  2.772\n        2016-08-05 19:00:00  2.239\n        2016-08-05 20:00:00  2.381\n        2016-08-05 21:00:00  2.452\n        2016-08-05 22:00:00  3.660\n        2016-08-05 23:00:00  3.411\n\n 24. We will repeat this sequence 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n 25. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-06 00:00:00  4.691\n2016-08-06 01:00:00  3.767\n2016-08-06 02:00:00  4.904\n... (until 2016-08-06 23:00:00: 3.411)\n2016-08-07 00:00:00  4.691\n2016-08-07 01:00:00  3.767\n... (and so on)\n2016-08-09 23:00:00  3.411\n```\n\n 26. But note: the last provided data point is 2016-08-05 23:00:00, so the next 96 start at 2016-08-06 00:00:00 and end at 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We generate 96 lines.\n\n 28. However, we must be cautious: the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points we didn't have any. For the forecast, we are generating without missing values? So we are providing complete data.\n\n 29. This method is simple and commonly used for seasonal data when we have limited history.\n\n 30. Let's write the first few and last few:\n\n        First day (2016-08-06):\n          00:00:00  4.691\n          01:00:00  3.767\n          02:00:00  4.904\n          03:00:00  3.980\n          04:00:00  4.300\n          05:00:00  3.980\n          06:00:00  4.442\n          07:00:00  4.833\n          08:00:00  4.264\n          09:00:00  3.376\n          10:00:00  3.198\n          11:00:00  3.411\n          12:00:00  2.630\n          13:00:00  2.274\n          14:00:00  2.843\n          15:00:00  2.203\n          16:00:00  2.630\n          17:00:00  2.843\n          18:00:00  2.772\n          19:00:00  2.239\n          20:00:00  2.381\n          21:00:00  2.452\n          22:00:00  3.660\n          23:00:00  3.411\n\n        Then the next day (2016-08-07) is the same.\n\n        And the last day (2016-08-09) will be the same 24 numbers again.\n\n 31. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 32. But note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we have to write all 96 lines.\n\n 33. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data is sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes. In this case, the provided data is hourly. So we are forecasting hourly.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-08-06 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n 34. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 35. Since we are repeating the same 24 numbers 4 times, we can generate the list of dates and then assign the values cyclically.\n\n 36. We'll write the answer in the format.\n",
