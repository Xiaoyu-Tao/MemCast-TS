        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some irregularities (like the negative values on 2017-02-05).\n 2. Given the data is hourly and we have 4 days (96 points), we can use a seasonal time series model. The seasonality period is 24.\n 3. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? We are only given 96 points without any gap? \n    Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", it might refer to the entire dataset, but the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96, and we must output complete data for the next 96.\n\n 4. We can use a model that handles seasonality and potentially missing values. However, since we are only given 96-points and no missing values in the training data, we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the small data (only 4 days), we might not have enough to capture long-term patterns, but we can try.\n\n 6. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern: low during the night, rising in the morning, then a dip around noon? and then again rising in the evening? \n    - However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n 7. We can use a simple seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day? However, the problem asks for 96 points (4 days) and we have 4 days of history. But the pattern might change.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet or ETS. But since we are in a text-based environment, we can use statistical models like SARIMA.\n\n 9. We choose to use SARIMA. We need to select parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). \n\n 10. We note that the data does not have a strong trend? Let's check the last day: \n      2017-02-05: \n        00:00:00  6.361\n        23:00:00  7.214\n      The day starts at 6.361 and ends at 7.214? But the previous days show a similar pattern? Actually, the values at the same hour of the day are not exactly the same.\n\n 11. We can try to difference the data to remove seasonality and trend. However, with only 4 days, we have to be cautious.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we can use an automated method to select the best parameters. But without a programming environment, we have to rely on a simple method.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? But that would ignore any trend and also the negative value on 2017-02-05 might be an outlier.\n\n 14. Considering the constraints, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 15. We decide to use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with additive seasonality and a period of 24. This method can handle seasonality and trend.\n\n 16. However, without running actual code, we have to simulate the method? But we are an AI, so we can use our internal modeling capabilities? Actually, we are expected to provide a forecast.\n\n 17. Since the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 points, we will generate the forecast by:\n\n     a) Using the last 4 days to compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n     b) However, we note that the data on 2017-02-05 has a dip in the afternoon (negative values) which is an anomaly? So we might want to smooth that out.\n\n 18. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days, but we have to be cautious of the negative values. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of outliers.\n\n 19. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: [7.427, 6.858, 6.752, 6.361] -> sorted: [6.361, 6.752, 6.858, 7.427] -> median = (6.752+6.858)/2 = 6.805\n     Hour 1: [6.290, 5.757, 5.686, 5.330] -> sorted: [5.330, 5.686, 5.757, 6.290] -> median = (5.686+5.757)/2 = 5.7215\n     ... and so on.\n\n 20. But note: the negative values on 2017-02-05 at 13:00 (-0.355), 14:00 (-2.701), 15:00 (-2.097) are outliers? So for hour 13, the values are: [1.635, 6.325, 5.010, -0.355] -> sorted: [-0.355, 1.635, 5.010, 6.325] -> median = (1.635+5.010)/2 = 3.3225\n\n 21. We can use the median for each hour to form a typical day and then repeat that for the next 4 days.\n\n 22. However, the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. And we are to forecast the next 96. We are not told to impute the training data.\n\n 23. Steps for the median method:\n\n     - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and then take the median of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00), we assign the median value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 24. But note: the data on 2017-02-05 is an anomaly? So using the median might be robust.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-05) as the pattern? But that day has negative values and might not be representative.\n\n 26. We decide to use the median method to form a typical day and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 27. How to compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: 00:00 -> [7.427, 6.858, 6.752, 6.361] -> median = 6.805\n     Hour 1: 01:00 -> [6.290, 5.757, 5.686, 5.330] -> median = 5.7215\n     Hour 2: 02:00 -> [5.650, 5.046, 5.082, 4.762] -> median = (5.046+5.082)/2 = 5.064\n     Hour 3: 03:00 -> [5.188, 4.762, 4.726, 4.335] -> sorted: [4.335, 4.726, 4.762, 5.188] -> median = (4.726+4.762)/2 = 4.744\n     Hour 4: 04:00 -> [5.010, 4.477, 4.477, 4.087] -> sorted: [4.087, 4.477, 4.477, 5.010] -> median = (4.477+4.477)/2 = 4.477\n     Hour 5: 05:00 -> [4.939, 4.442, 4.513, 4.051] -> sorted: [4.051, 4.442, 4.513, 4.939] -> median = (4.442+4.513)/2 = 4.4775\n     Hour 6: 06:00 -> [5.295, 4.655, 4.904, 4.300] -> sorted: [4.300, 4.655, 4.904, 5.295] -> median = (4.655+4.904)/2 = 4.7795\n     Hour 7: 07:00 -> [6.396, 5.650, 6.041, 5.650] -> sorted: [5.650, 5.650, 6.041, 6.396] -> median = (5.650+6.041)/2 = 5.8455\n     Hour 8: 08:00 -> [8.422, 8.173, 7.924, 7.604] -> sorted: [7.604, 7.924, 8.173, 8.422] -> median = (7.924+8.173)/2 = 8.0485\n     Hour 9: 09:00 -> [6.290, 6.432, 6.538, 5.863] -> sorted: [5.863, 6.290, 6.432, 6.538] -> median = (6.290+6.432)/2 = 6.361\n     Hour 10: 10:00 -> [4.477, 5.899, 4.548, 4.868] -> sorted: [4.477, 4.548, 4.868, 5.899] -> median = (4.548+4.868)/2 = 4.708\n     Hour 11: 11:00 -> [3.589, 6.610, 4.513, 3.589] -> sorted: [3.589, 3.589, 4.513, 6.610] -> median = (3.589+4.513)/2 = 4.051\n     Hour 12: 12:00 -> [2.914, 6.894, 3.696, 3.553] -> sorted: [2.914, 3.553, 3.696, 6.894] -> median = (3.553+3.696)/2 = 3.6245\n     Hour 13: 13:00 -> [1.635, 6.325, 5.010, -0.355] -> sorted: [-0.355, 1.635, 5.010, 6.325] -> median = (1.635+5.010)/2 = 3.3225\n     Hour 14: 14:00 -> [0.995, 6.432, 5.437, -2.701] -> sorted: [-2.701, 0.995, 5.437, 6.432] -> median = (0.995+5.437)/2 = 3.216\n     Hour 15: 15:00 -> [1.848, 7.356, 5.437, -2.097] -> sorted: [-2.097, 1.848, 5.437, 7.356] -> median = (1.848+5.437)/2 = 3.6425\n     Hour 16: 16:00 -> [5.721, 8.813, 5.615, 2.097] -> sorted: [2.097, 5.615, 5.721, 8.813] -> median = (5.615+5.721)/2 = 5.668\n     Hour 17: 17:00 -> [6.894, 8.671, 6.219, 5.721] -> sorted: [5.721, 6.219, 6.894, 8.671] -> median = (6.219+6.894)/2 = 6.5565\n     Hour 18: 18:00 -> [7.853, 8.884, 7.249, 6.929] -> sorted: [6.929, 7.249, 7.853, 8.884] -> median = (7.249+7.853)/2 = 7.551\n     Hour 19: 19:00 -> [9.594, 9.879, 8.671, 8.706] -> sorted: [8.671, 8.706, 9.594, 9.879] -> median = (8.706+9.594)/2 = 9.15\n     Hour 20: 20:00 -> [10.732, 10.625, 9.772, 9.666] -> sorted: [9.666, 9.772, 10.625, 10.732] -> median = (9.772+10.625)/2 = 10.1985\n     Hour 21: 21:00 -> [10.909, 10.199, 9.914, 9.559] -> sorted: [9.559, 9.914, 10.199, 10.909] -> median = (9.914+10.199)/2 = 10.0565\n     Hour 22: 22:00 -> [9.594, 9.452, 9.168, 8.671] -> sorted: [8.671, 9.168, 9.452, 9.594] -> median = (9.168+9.452)/2 = 9.31\n     Hour 23: 23:00 -> [8.209, 8.138, 7.569, 7.214] -> sorted: [7.214, 7.569, 8.138, 8.209] -> median = (7.569+8.138)/2 = 7.8535\n\n 28. Now, we form a typical day:\n\n        hour0: 6.805\n        hour1: 5.7215\n        hour2: 5.064\n        hour3: 4.744\n        hour4: 4.477\n        hour5: 4.4775\n        hour6: 4.7795\n        hour7: 5.8455\n        hour8: 8.0485\n        hour9: 6.361\n        hour10: 4.708\n        hour11: 4.051\n        hour12: 3.6245\n        hour13: 3.3225\n        hour14: 3.216\n        hour15: 3.6425\n        hour16: 5.668\n        hour17: 6.5565\n        hour18: 7.551\n        hour19: 9.15\n        hour20: 10.1985\n        hour21: 10.0565\n        hour22: 9.31\n        hour23: 7.8535\n\n 29. Then, we repeat this typical day for the next 4 days (from 2017-02-06 to 2017-02-09).\n\n 30. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-06 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-02-07 00:00:00 to 2017-02-07 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-02-08 00:00:00 to 2017-02-08 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-02-09 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00\n\n 31. We assign the typical day values for each hour.\n\n 32. Format the output: We must output the date and the MUFL value, with the date in the same format.\n\n 33. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-06 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n 34. We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n 35. However, note: the median method might not capture the trend if there is one. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Also, the negative values on 2017-02-05 are averaged out.\n\n 36. This is a simple and robust method.\n\n 37. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        date, MUFL\n        2017-02-06 00:00:00, 6.805\n        2017-02-06 01:00:00, 5.7215\n        2017-02-06 02:00:00, 5.064\n        ... and so on for the first day.\n\n        Then for the second day (2017-02-07) we use the same typical day.\n\n 38. We must output 96 points.\n\n 39. We note that the median values we computed are to be used for each corresponding hour.\n\n 40. We output the numbers with 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. But our medians are computed to 4 decimals. We can round to 3 decimals.\n\n 41. Rounding:\n\n        6.805 -> 6.805 (we can leave as is, but the input had 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimals: 6.805)\n        5.7215 -> 5.722 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n 42. We round the median values to 3 decimal places.\n\n 43. Let's recalc the medians:\n\n        hour0: 6.805 -> 6.805\n        hour1: 5.7215 -> 5.722\n        hour2: 5.064 -> 5.064\n        hour3: 4.744 -> 4.744\n        hour4: 4.477 -> 4.477\n        hour5: 4.4775 -> 4.478\n        hour6: 4.7795 -> 4.780\n        hour7: 5.8455 -> 5.846\n        hour8: 8.0485 -> 8.049\n        hour9: 6.361 -> 6.361\n        hour10: 4.708 -> 4.708\n        hour11: 4.051 -> 4.051\n        hour12: 3.6245 -> 3.625\n        hour13: 3.3225 -> 3.323\n        hour14: 3.216 -> 3.216\n        hour15: 3.6425 -> 3.643\n        hour16: 5.668 -> 5.668\n        hour17: 6.5565 -> 6.557\n        hour18: 7.551 -> 7.551\n        hour19: 9.15 -> 9.150\n        hour20: 10.1985 -> 10.199\n        hour21: 10.0565 -> 10.057\n        hour22: 9.31 -> 9.310\n        hour23: 7.8535 -> 7.854\n\n 44. Now, we generate the next 96 points.\n\n 45. We write the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-06 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 23:00:00 for the first day.\n        Then 2017-02-07 00:00:00, ... until 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n 46.
