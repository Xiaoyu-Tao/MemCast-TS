        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (4 days * 24 hours) of the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) for a transformer.\n The data has missing values, but in the provided snippet, we don't see any (all hours are present). However, we must be cautious.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is at hourly frequency.\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data shows a clear daily seasonality (with peaks and troughs at similar hours) and we have only 4 days, we can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any, but from the data the trend over 4 days might be weak)\n   - Seasonality (daily: 24 hours)\n\n However, note that the data has negative values and fluctuations.\n\n Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can consider:\n   - Seasonal models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) might be suitable.\n\n But note: the data has a pattern that repeats every day? Let's observe:\n\n   Each day:\n     - Starts with positive values (around 5-6) in the early hours (00:00 to 06:00)\n     - Then drops to negative during the day (from 07:00 to 16:00) with the most negative around 12:00-13:00.\n     - Then rises again in the evening (17:00 onwards) to positive.\n\n However, the pattern on 2017-05-11 is a bit different (less negative in the afternoon and even positive at 15:00 and 16:00).\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, we are to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n We can use a simple seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But with only 4 days, decomposition might be unstable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that uses the last day as a template and adjust by the average change? But that might not capture the trend.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose using a seasonal naive approach? But that would just repeat the last day, which might not be accurate.\n\n However, note that the problem says there are missing values in the data, but in the provided 96 points we don't see any. So we can assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact date of the next 96, but we know the last date is 2017-05-12 23:00:00, then the next 96 hours would be from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n But note: the data might have weekly seasonality? We don't have enough data to capture weekly (only 4 days). So we focus on daily.\n\n Considering the above, I will use a model that can capture daily seasonality. One of the simplest and effective for this context is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model.\n\n Steps for SARIMA:\n   - We have hourly data, so seasonality period is 24.\n   - We need to check for stationarity. The data has a clear daily pattern, so we might need to difference by 24.\n\n However, with only 4 days (96 points) and a seasonal period of 24, we have only 4 seasonal periods. This is very few for fitting a SARIMA model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall level? But that would be a constant daily pattern.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (2017-05-12) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? But that might not be robust.\n\n Given the complexity and the small data, I will use a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model with additive seasonality and a period of 24. This model is designed for data with trend and seasonality and can work with short series.\n\n However, note: the Holt-Winters model requires at least two full seasons (48 points) to fit, which we have (96 points = 4 seasons). So we can try.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-05-09): average = (6.29+5.792+...+3.447)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n        positive in the night, negative in the day -> average might be around negative? \n   We can compute the average for each day:\n\n   Day1: \n        mean = (6.29+5.792+6.112+6.503+6.432+6.823+5.757+4.158-0.391-7.427-16.453-18.798-21.25-20.433-17.767-13.29-8.564-0.64+3.02+3.873+3.98+3.34+2.772+3.447)/24\n        = (-45.5) / 24 \u2248 -1.9\n\n   Day2: \n        mean = (5.543+5.828+5.934+5.33+5.117+6.503+6.219+0-7.107-12.508-15.778-18.123-20.433-19.615-17.163-13.645-8.173+0.533+2.63+3.696+3.767+3.305+2.665+3.02)/24\n        = (-55.5) / 24 \u2248 -2.31\n\n   Day3: \n        mean = (5.295+4.762+3.909+4.087+4.62+4.904+4.3+1.35-3.234-3.092-8.386-16.844-16.666-14.143-5.615+0.249+1.066+3.767+3.66+3.696+3.02+2.487+2.239)/24\n        = (-15.5) / 24 \u2248 -0.65\n\n   Day4: \n        mean = (4.264+5.295+3.127+3.944+5.401+5.366+3.98+3.553+2.772+1.883+1.137-18.762-18.478-20.504-13.503-14.711-6.574-2.025+2.381+3.66+4.264+3.909+3.305+2.878)/24\n        = (-35.5) / 24 \u2248 -1.48\n\n There is no clear trend in the daily average. So we can assume a constant level? But the daily pattern is strong.\n\n Given the above, I will use the Holt-Winters additive model with seasonality of 24.\n\n However, note: the data might have missing values in the future? The problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but we are to forecast the next 96 without missing? Actually, the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must provide 96 points without missing.\n\n But the problem says the data we are given has missing values?\n   The user says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\"\n\n However, in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing. So we assume the given data is complete? Or we must impute?\n\n Since the user did not specify which points are missing, and the provided data has 96 consecutive hours without gap, we assume the given data is complete.\n\n Steps for Holt-Winters:\n\n   We'll fit the model on the 96 points and then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n   The model: \n        y_t = level + trend * t + seasonality_{t mod 24} + error\n\n   But note: the trend might be damped? Or without trend? We can try without trend (additive seasonality only) because the daily average does not show a clear trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the `ExponentialSmoothing` from `statsmodels` with additive trend and additive seasonality? But with 4 seasons, we have to be cautious.\n\n   Given the small data, we might use a simpler model: the average of the same hour over the 4 days, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n   However, the problem requires a forecast, and the pattern might change? But with only 4 days, we don't have much to go on.\n\n   Let me try the average method:\n\n        For hour 00:00: average of [6.29, 5.543, 5.295, 4.264] = (6.29+5.543+5.295+4.264)/4 = 5.348\n        For hour 01:00: (5.792+5.828+4.762+5.295)/4 = 5.41925\n\n        ... and so on for each hour of the day.\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days would be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   But note: the last day (2017-05-12) has a different pattern? We might want to give more to the recent day? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? (exponential smoothing per hour)\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the method. Since we are experts, we must choose a reasonable method.\n\n   Considering the simplicity and the data size, I will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a daily pattern and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n   Why?\n     - The data does not show a clear trend in the daily average (the daily averages: -1.9, -2.31, -0.65, -1.48) -> the average of these is about -1.585, but the pattern is consistent in shape.\n\n   However, the pattern on 2017-05-11 (day3) is different: the afternoon values are less negative. But without more data, we cannot know if that is an anomaly or a weekend effect? (Note: 2017-05-11 is Thursday, 2017-05-12 is Friday, then the next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday). We don't have weekend data? \n\n   But we are not given the day of the week? and we only have 4 days? So we cannot model weekly seasonality.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23):\n            value_h = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days for hour h on day1 (2017-05-13) = value_h\n        Similarly, for day2 (2017-05-14), day3 (2017-05-15), day4 (2017-05-16) at hour h: value_h\n\n   This will give a constant daily pattern.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we don't have any in the given data. So we use the above.\n\n   However, the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\", meaning we must output 96 points without missing.\n\n   We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-13 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n   How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n        Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n            day1: 6.29\n            day2: 5.543\n            day3: 5.295\n            day4: 4.264\n            average = (6.29+5.543+5.295+4.264)/4 = 5.348\n\n        Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n            day1: 5.792\n            day2: 5.828\n            day3: 4.762\n            day4: 5.295\n            average = (5.792+5.828+4.762+5.295)/4 = 5.41925\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n        2017-05-13 00:00:00: 5.348\n        2017-05-13 01:00:00: 5.41925\n        ... until 2017-05-13 23:00:00: [average for hour 23]\n\n        Then 2017-05-14 00:00:00: 5.348 (same as hour0)\n        ... and so on.\n\n   This is a very simple method, but with only 4 days and no clear trend, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"expert\", so we might be expected to use a more sophisticated method? But with only 4 days, complex models might overfit.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-12) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have to forecast 4 days. We could repeat the last day 4 times? But that would ignore the variation.\n\n   Given the above, I choose the average method.\n\n   Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour0: (6.290000 + 5.543000 + 5.295000 + 4.264000) / 4 = 21.392 / 4 = 5.348\n        hour1: (5.792000 + 5.828000 + 4.762000 + 5.295000) / 4 = 21.677 / 4 = 5.41925\n        hour2: (6.112000 + 5.934000 + 3.909000 + 3.127000) / 4 = 19.082 / 4 = 4.7705\n        hour3: (6.503000 + 5.330000 + 4.087000 + 3.944000) / 4 = 19.864 / 4 = 4.966\n        hour4: (6.432000 + 5.117000 + 4.620000 + 5.401000) / 4 = 21.57 / 4 = 5.3925\n        hour5: (6.823000 + 6.503000 + 4.904000 + 5.366000) / 4 = 23.596 / 4 = 5.899\n        hour6: (5.757000 + 6.219000 + 4.300000 + 3.980000) / 4 = 20.256 / 4 = 5.064\n        hour7: (4.158000 + 0.000000 + 1.350000 + 3.553000) / 4 = 9.061 / 4 = 2.26525\n        hour8: (-0.391000 + -7.107000 + -3.234000 + 2.772000) / 4 = (-7.96) / 4 = -1.99\n        hour9: (-7.427000 + -12.508000 + -3.092000 + 1.883000) / 4 = (-21.144) / 4 = -5.286\n        hour10: (-16.452999 + -15.778000 + -8.386000 + 1.137000) / 4 = (-39.48) / 4 = -9.87\n        hour11: (-18.798000 + -18.122999 + -16.844000 + -18.762000) / 4 = (-72.526) / 4 = -18.1315\n        hour12: (-21.250000 + -20.433001 + -16.666000 + -18.478000) / 4 = (-76.827) / 4 = -19.20675\n        hour13: (-20.433001 + -19.615000 + -14.143000 + -20.504000) / 4 = (-74.695) / 4 = -18.67375\n        hour14: (-17.767000 + -17.163000 + -5.615000 + -13.503000) / 4 = (-54.048) / 4 = -13.512\n        hour15: (-13.290000 + -13.645000 + 0.249000 + -14.711000) / 4 = (-41.397) / 4 = -10.34925\n        hour16: (-8.564000 + -8.173000 + 1.066000 + -6.574000) / 4 = (-22.245) / 4 = -5.56125\n        hour17: (-0.640000 + 0.533000 + 3.767000 + -2.025000) / 4 = 1.635 / 4 = 0.40875\n        hour18: (3.020000 + 2.630000 + 3.660000 + 2.381000) / 4 = 11.691 / 4 = 2.92275\n        hour19: (3.873000 + 3.696000 + 3.660000 + 3.660000) / 4 = 14.889 / 4 = 3.72225\n        hour20: (3.980000 + 3.767000 + 3.696000 + 4.264000) / 4 = 15.707 / 4 = 3.92675\n        hour21: (3.340000 + 3.305000 + 3.020000 + 3.909000) / 4 = 13.574 / 4 = 3.3935\n        hour22: (2.772000 + 2.665000 + 2.487000 + 3.305000) / 4 = 11.229 / 4 = 2.80725\n        hour23: (3.447000 + 3.020000 + 2.239000 + 2.878000) / 4 = 11.584 / 4 = 2.896\n\n   Then we repeat these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n   We generate the timestamps:\n\n        Day1: 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-13 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-05-14 00:00:00 to 2017-05-14 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-05-15 00:00:00 to 2017-05-15 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-05-16 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00\n\n   We output the data in the same format.\n\n   However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places? The original data has up to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Let me write the averages rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 5.348 -> 5.348\n        hour1: 5.41925 -> 5.419\n        hour2: 4.7705 -> 4.771\n        But note: the original data has 3 decimals, but sometimes more? Actually, the data has up to 6 decimals? But we see the original data is given with 3 decimals mostly, but sometimes 6? Actually, the data is given with 3 decimal places, but we see -16.452999 -> that is 6. We should output 3 decimals? \n\n   The problem does not specify. We'll output with 3 decimals.\n\n   However, the original data has mixed: some have 3, some have 6? But the user presented with 3. We'll output 3.\n\n   So:\n\n        hour0: 5.348 -> 5.348 (if we keep 3 decimals, it's 5.348)\n        hour1: 5.419 -> 5.419\n        But 5.41925 rounded to 3 decimals is 5.419? Actually, 5.41925 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal (2) -> so 5.419.\n\n   We'll round each to 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output as the same precision as the input?
