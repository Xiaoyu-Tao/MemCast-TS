        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-09-19 00:00:00 to 2016-09-22 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same hourly frequency.\n\n 4. Since the data is time series with hourly frequency and we observe daily seasonality (temperature rises during the day and falls at night), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the limited data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a simple model that can extrapolate the pattern.\n\n 6. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily cycle (period=24)\n    - Possibly a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly. Therefore, we focus on daily.\n\n 7. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a model like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing with seasonality) or SARIMA.\n\n 8. However, note: we are to provide the forecast for the next 96 points. We must be cautious because the data is short.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n    - We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n 10. Steps for a simple method:\n     a) Extract the daily average for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the same hour across the 4 days.\n     b) But note: there might be a trend? Let's check the overall level of the series.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a moving average to remove the seasonality and then model the trend, but again, we have only 4 days.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we might use a model that can handle seasonality automatically.\n\n 13. We choose to use a simple seasonal naive model? Not good because we are forecasting 96 steps.\n\n 14. We can use a seasonal decomposition of time series by LOESS (STL) and then forecast the seasonally adjusted series with a linear model? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet or SARIMA. However, we are in a constrained environment and must output the forecast.\n\n 16. Since we are to provide the data, we cannot run complex models without code. Therefore, we will use a simple average daily pattern and adjust by the last day's level.\n\n 17. How?\n     - Step 1: Compute the average for each hour (0-23) over the 4 days.\n        But note: the data might have a trend? Let's see the average temperature per day:\n          Day1 (19th): average = (22.37+...+21.737)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n          We can compute the mean for each day and see if there's a trend.\n\n     - Step 2: If there is a trend, we can project the trend forward.\n\n 18. Let's compute the daily means (by eye, roughly):\n      Day1: from 22.37 to 21.737 -> average around 22.5? (but we have high in the day and low at night)\n      We can calculate:\n\n        Day1: 19th: mean = (22.37+22.722+22.58+22.37+21.034+20.33+19.697+20.682+20.682+22.441+24.34+24.34+24.27+25.466+26.31+27.013+26.732+25.888+25.044+23.988+23.848+22.159+21.878+21.737) /24\n        This is tedious, but we can note that the values range from ~19.7 to 27.0 -> average might be around 23.\n\n        Similarly, Day2: 20th: from 21.948 to 21.667 -> similar range? \n        Day3: 21st: from 22.3 to 20.19 -> \n        Day4: 22nd: from 19.979 to 21.174 -> \n\n     Actually, we don't have a clear trend in the overall level from these 4 days. So we can assume the level is stable.\n\n 19. Therefore, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form the daily pattern.\n\n 20. How to forecast:\n        For hour 0: average of [22.37 (19th), 21.948 (20th), 22.3 (21st), 19.979 (22nd)] -> then use that as the forecast for 23rd 00:00:00, 24th 00:00:00, etc.\n\n     But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So we can repeat the daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 21. However, we must account for the fact that the last day (22nd) might be lower? But without a clear trend, we use the average.\n\n 22. Steps:\n      a) Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n      b) Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat this daily pattern 4 times.\n\n 23. But note: the data might have a slight trend? We can also consider using the last day's value as a base and adjust by the daily pattern? \n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the average daily pattern and then adjust by the overall average of the last day? \n\n 25. Let me compute the overall average of the last day (22nd) and compare to the overall average of the entire 4 days.\n\n 26. However, for simplicity and because we have only 4 days, we will use the average daily pattern.\n\n 27. How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (22.37 + 21.948 + 22.3 + 19.979) / 4\n        hour1: (22.722 + 21.737 + 21.878 + 19.697) / 4\n        ... until hour23.\n\n 28. Then, the forecast for:\n        2016-09-23 00:00:00 = hour0_avg\n        2016-09-23 01:00:00 = hour1_avg\n        ...\n        2016-09-23 23:00:00 = hour23_avg\n        2016-09-24 00:00:00 = hour0_avg\n        ... and so on.\n\n 29. But note: the data might have missing values? The provided 96 points are complete. So we can compute the average.\n\n 30. However, we are to be cautious: the problem says the data will have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we proceed.\n\n 31. We must output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 32. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (22.370001 + 21.948000 + 22.299999 + 19.979000) / 4 = (22.370001+21.948+22.3+19.979)/4 = 86.597/4 = 21.64925\n        hour1: (22.722000 + 21.737000 + 21.878000 + 19.697001) / 4 = (22.722+21.737+21.878+19.697001)/4 = 86.034001/4 = 21.50850025\n        ... and so on.\n\n 33. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 34. But note: the data has 3 decimal places? We see up to 3. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 35. However, the original data has up to 3 decimal places? Let's see: 22.370001 -> we can keep 3 decimal places? But the original has 6. We'll output with 6 decimal places to match.\n\n 36. Alternatively, we can output with the same precision as the input. The input has 6 decimal places? Actually, the numbers are given with 6 decimal places but the values are often .000 or .001. We'll compute the average and then round to 6 decimal places.\n\n 37. But note: the average might have more digits. We'll compute and then format to 6 decimal places.\n\n 38. However, we are to provide the exact numbers. We can compute the average and then write with 6 decimal places.\n\n 39. But wait: is this the best method? It ignores any trend. However, with only 4 days and no clear trend, it is acceptable.\n\n 40. Alternatively, we can use the last day (22nd) as the base and then add the deviation from the daily average for that hour? \n\n    For a given hour, the deviation from the daily average on the 22nd is: value - (average of 22nd)\n    Then for the next day, we set: forecast = (overall average for that hour) + (deviation of the last day from its daily average) ??? \n\n 41. Actually, we can use the average daily pattern without adjustment.\n\n 42. We'll compute the 24 hourly means.\n\n 43. Steps to compute:\n\n        hour0: [19th:22.370001, 20th:21.948000, 21st:22.299999, 22nd:19.979000] -> average = (22.370001+21.948000+22.299999+19.979000)/4 = 86.596/4 = 21.649000\n        hour1: [22.722000, 21.737000, 21.878000, 19.697001] -> 86.034001/4 = 21.50850025 -> 21.508500\n        ... \n\n 44. We do for all 24.\n\n 45. Then, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-23 00:00:00 -> hour0_avg\n        Then 2016-09-23 01:00:00 -> hour1_avg\n        ... until 2016-09-23 23:00:00 -> hour23_avg\n\n        Then 2016-09-24 00:00:00 -> hour0_avg\n        ... until 2016-09-24 23:00:00 -> hour23_avg\n\n        Then 2016-09-25 00:00:00 -> hour0_avg\n        ... until 2016-09-25 23:00:00 -> hour23_avg\n\n        Then 2016-09-26 00:00:00 -> hour0_avg\n        ... until 2016-09-26 23:00:00 -> hour23_avg\n\n 46. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 47. The last date in the input is 2016-09-22 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-09-23 00:00:00.\n\n 48. We'll create 96 rows.\n\n 49. We'll compute the hourly averages for the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (22.370001 + 21.948000 + 22.299999 + 19.979000) / 4 = 86.596000 / 4 = 21.649000\n        hour1: (22.722000 + 21.737000 + 21.878000 + 19.697001) / 4 = 86.034001 / 4 = 21.50850025 -> 21.508500\n        hour2: (22.580999 + 21.878000 + 22.230000 + 19.486000) / 4 = (22.580999+21.878+22.23+19.486) = 86.174999 /4 = 21.54374975 -> 21.543750\n        hour3: (22.370001 + 21.385000 + 22.230000 + 19.416000) /4 = (22.370001+21.385+22.23+19.416) = 85.401001 /4 = 21.35025025 -> 21.350250\n        hour4: (21.034000 + 21.597000 + 22.722000 + 19.627001) /4 = (21.034+21.597+22.722+19.627001) = 84.980001 /4 = 21.24500025 -> 21.245000\n        hour5: (20.330000 + 21.737000 + 22.511000 + 19.837999) /4 = (20.33+21.737+22.511+19.838) = 84.416 /4 = 21.104000\n        hour6: (19.697001 + 20.471001 + 22.792000 + 20.471001) /4 = (19.697001+20.471001+22.792+20.471001) = 83.431003 /4 = 20.85775075 -> 20.857751\n        hour7: (20.681999 + 21.174000 + 22.089001 + 20.330000) /4 = (20.682+21.174+22.089+20.33) = 84.275 /4 = 21.068750\n        hour8: (20.681999 + 21.948000 + 23.285000 + 20.190001) /4 = (20.682+21.948+23.285+20.19) = 86.105 /4 = 21.526250\n        hour9: (22.441000 + 23.285000 + 23.636999 + 21.315001) /4 = (22.441+23.285+23.637+21.315) = 90.678 /4 = 22.669500\n        hour10: (24.340000 + 25.888000 + 24.340000 + 23.636999) /4 = (24.34+25.888+24.34+23.637) = 98.205 /4 = 24.551250\n        hour11: (24.340000 + 25.816999 + 24.903000 + 24.551001) /4 = (24.34+25.817+24.903+24.551) = 99.611 /4 = 24.902750\n        hour12: (24.270000 + 25.325001 + 24.691999 + 25.888000) /4 = (24.27+25.325+24.692+25.888) = 100.175 /4 = 25.043750\n        hour13: (25.466000 + 26.099001 + 24.481001 + 25.747000) /4 = (25.466+26.099+24.481+25.747) = 101.793 /4 = 25.448250\n        hour14: (26.309999 + 27.927999 + 24.340000 + 25.044001) /4 = (26.31+27.928+24.34+25.044) = 103.622 /4 = 25.905500\n        hour15: (27.013000 + 25.535999 + 23.848000 + 25.395000) /4 = (27.013+25.536+23.848+25.395) = 101.792 /4 = 25.448000\n        hour16: (26.732000 + 26.802000 + 23.355000 + 25.325001) /4 = (26.732+26.802+23.355+25.325) = 102.214 /4 = 25.553500\n        hour17: (25.888000 + 25.535999 + 22.792000 + 23.143999) /4 = (25.888+25.536+22.792+23.144) = 97.36 /4 = 24.340000\n        hour18: (25.044001 + 24.761999 + 22.511000 + 22.159000) /4 = (25.044+24.762+22.511+22.159) = 94.476 /4 = 23.619000\n        hour19: (23.988001 + 23.143999 + 21.667000 + 22.370001) /4 = (23.988+23.144+21.667+22.37) = 91.169 /4 = 22.792250\n        hour20: (23.848000 + 22.370001 + 21.455999 + 22.089001) /4 = (23.848+22.37+21.456+22.089) = 89.763 /4 = 22.440750\n        hour21: (22.159000 + 21.455999 + 20.612000 + 21.667000) /4 = (22.159+21.456+20.612+21.667) = 85.894 /4 = 21.473500\n        hour22: (21.878000 + 21.034000 + 20.330000 + 21.174000) /4 = (21.878+21.034+20.33+21.174) = 84.416 /4 = 21.104000\n        hour23: (21.737000 + 21.667000 + 20.190001 + 21.174000) /4 = (21.737+21.667+20.19+21.174) = 84.768 /4 = 21.192000\n\n 50. Now, we have the 24 averages. We'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-23\n          00:00:00 -> 21.649000\n          01:00:00 -> 21.508500\n          02:00:00 -> 21.543750\n          03:00:00 -> 21.350250\n          04:00:00 -> 21.245000\n          05:00:00 -> 21.104000\n          06:00:00 -> 20.857751\n          07:00:00 -> 21.068750\n          08:00:00 -> 21.526250\n          09:00:00 -> 22.669500\n          10:00:00 -> 24.551250\n          11:00:00 -> 24.902750\n          12:00:00 -> 25.043750\n          13:00:00 -> 25.448250\n          14:00:00 -> 25.905500\n          15:00:00 -> 25.448000\n          16:00:00 -> 25.553500\n          17:00:00 -> 24.340000\n          18:00:00 -> 23.619000\n          19:00:00 -> 22.792250\n          20:00:00 -> 22.440750\n          21:00:00 -> 21.473500\n          22:00:00 -> 21.104000\n          23:00:00 -> 21.192000\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 51.
