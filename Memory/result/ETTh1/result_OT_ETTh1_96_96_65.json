        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for the purpose of forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 2. We must choose a forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal decomposition: The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days, so weekly is not visible.\n    - Models: SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality), or even machine learning model if we can engineer features.\n\n 3. Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 points, we can try to fit a model that captures:\n    - Trend: The data does not show a clear long-term trend over 4 days, but there are fluctuations.\n    - Seasonality: We suspect daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 4. We note that the data has some irregularities (like a drop on 2017-03-19). We must be cautious.\n\n 5. We will use an automated approach to select the best model parameters. However, we are constrained by the data length.\n\n 6. We can use the `statsmodels` library to fit a SARIMA model. Since we are in a simulated environment, we will describe the steps and then generate the forecast.\n\n 7. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We'll check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    - We'll use auto_arima to find the best parameters (if we had the library) or we can manually try.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive method: using the last available day (2017-03-21) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the data from 2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21 are 4 days, and we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 9. However, the data does not look perfectly seasonal. For example, the pattern on 2017-03-19 is very different (with a drop to 2.884 and 2.251). \n    So we cannot rely on a simple seasonal naive.\n\n10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without the ability to run code, we must use a method that can be described and then manually adjusted.\n\n11. We can use an average of the last 4 days for each hour? But the drop on 2017-03-19 might be an outlier.\n\n12. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). But again, without running code, we have to simulate.\n\n13. Since the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 points, and we are to provide it in the specified format, we will generate the forecast by:\n\n    a) Taking the average of each hour across the 4 available days (if we had 4 full days). But note: we have exactly 4 days (96 hours). \n    b) However, the data on 2017-03-19 is very different. We might want to use the median to avoid the outlier effect.\n\n    Let's break the data into 4 segments of 24 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-18 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-03-19 00:00:00 to 2017-03-19 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-03-20 00:00:00 to 2017-03-20 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-03-21 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00\n\n    For each hour (0 to 23), we take the median of the 4 days for that hour to form a typical day.\n\n    Why median? Because on 2017-03-19, we have very low values (like 2.251 at 20:00) which might be an outlier. The median will be less affected.\n\n    Then we use this typical day and repeat it for the next 4 days (2017-03-22 to 2017-03-25).\n\n14. Steps to compute the median for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0: [9.708, 8.512, 5.768, 7.809] -> sort: [5.768, 7.809, 8.512, 9.708] -> median = (7.809+8.512)/2 = 8.1605\n    But wait, we have 4 points? The median for even number is the average of the two middle ones.\n\n    However, let's do it for all 24 hours.\n\n15. But note: the data we are given is exactly 96 hours (4*24). We can reshape the OT column into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n    Let me create the matrix:\n\n        Day1: [9.708, 9.849, 9.989, 9.426, 9.989, 9.567, 9.708, 10.763, 10.060, 9.778, 9.215, 9.849, 10.271, 9.497, 9.004, 9.215, 8.934, 8.723, 9.004, 9.497, 9.778, 9.426, 8.160, 8.371]\n        Day2: [8.512, 8.020, 7.738, 7.668, 7.457, 7.246, 6.753, 5.768, 6.331, 3.588, 5.487, 4.924, 5.909, 5.839, 5.909, 5.628, 5.698, 5.839, 5.698, 2.884, 2.251, 5.065, 5.768, 5.909]\n        Day3: [5.768, 5.557, 3.869, 5.839, 7.246, 6.824, 6.753, 7.457, 7.668, 8.934, 7.879, 6.331, 7.316, 8.090, 6.753, 6.683, 8.090, 7.668, 7.668, 7.738, 8.512, 7.879, 7.457, 8.371]\n        Day4: [7.809, 8.442, 6.753, 6.964, 7.597, 7.597, 7.035, 6.964, 6.472, 7.738, 7.879, 7.809, 8.020, 9.215, 10.271, 10.482, 10.130, 9.708, 10.552, 10.622, 11.326, 9.356, 8.864, 8.723]\n\n    Now, for each hour (column index 0 to 23) we take the median of the 4 days.\n\n    Example for hour0 (index0): [9.708, 8.512, 5.768, 7.809] -> sorted: [5.768, 7.809, 8.512, 9.708] -> median = (7.809+8.512)/2 = 8.1605\n    hour1: [9.849, 8.020, 5.557, 8.442] -> sorted: [5.557, 8.020, 8.442, 9.849] -> median = (8.020+8.442)/2 = 8.231\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n16. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is the median day repeated 4 times.\n\n17. However, we must also consider that there might be a trend? But the data is too short to see a trend. We are only using 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n18. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n    hour0: [9.708, 8.512, 5.768, 7.809] -> 8.1605\n    hour1: [9.849, 8.020, 5.557, 8.442] -> 8.231\n    hour2: [9.989, 7.738, 3.869, 6.753] -> sorted: [3.869, 6.753, 7.738, 9.989] -> median = (6.753+7.738)/2 = 7.2455\n    hour3: [9.426, 7.668, 5.839, 6.964] -> sorted: [5.839, 6.964, 7.668, 9.426] -> median = (6.964+7.668)/2 = 7.316\n    hour4: [9.989, 7.457, 7.246, 7.597] -> sorted: [7.246, 7.457, 7.597, 9.989] -> median = (7.457+7.597)/2 = 7.527\n    hour5: [9.567, 7.246, 6.824, 7.597] -> sorted: [6.824, 7.246, 7.597, 9.567] -> median = (7.246+7.597)/2 = 7.4215\n    hour6: [9.708, 6.753, 6.753, 7.035] -> sorted: [6.753, 6.753, 7.035, 9.708] -> median = (6.753+7.035)/2 = 6.894\n    hour7: [10.763, 5.768, 7.457, 6.964] -> sorted: [5.768, 6.964, 7.457, 10.763] -> median = (6.964+7.457)/2 = 7.2105\n    hour8: [10.060, 6.331, 7.668, 6.472] -> sorted: [6.331, 6.472, 7.668, 10.060] -> median = (6.472+7.668)/2 = 7.070\n    hour9: [9.778, 3.588, 8.934, 7.738] -> sorted: [3.588, 7.738, 8.934, 9.778] -> median = (7.738+8.934)/2 = 8.336\n    hour10: [9.215, 5.487, 7.879, 7.879] -> sorted: [5.487, 7.879, 7.879, 9.215] -> median = (7.879+7.879)/2 = 7.879\n    hour11: [9.849, 4.924, 6.331, 7.809] -> sorted: [4.924, 6.331, 7.809, 9.849] -> median = (6.331+7.809)/2 = 7.070\n    hour12: [10.271, 5.909, 7.316, 8.020] -> sorted: [5.909, 7.316, 8.020, 10.271] -> median = (7.316+8.020)/2 = 7.668\n    hour13: [9.497, 5.839, 8.090, 9.215] -> sorted: [5.839, 8.090, 9.215, 9.497] -> median = (8.090+9.215)/2 = 8.6525\n    hour14: [9.004, 5.909, 6.753, 10.271] -> sorted: [5.909, 6.753, 9.004, 10.271] -> median = (6.753+9.004)/2 = 7.8785\n    hour15: [9.215, 5.628, 6.683, 10.482] -> sorted: [5.628, 6.683, 9.215, 10.482] -> median = (6.683+9.215)/2 = 7.949\n    hour16: [8.934, 5.698, 8.090, 10.130] -> sorted: [5.698, 8.090, 8.934, 10.130] -> median = (8.090+8.934)/2 = 8.512\n    hour17: [8.723, 5.839, 7.668, 9.708] -> sorted: [5.839, 7.668, 8.723, 9.708] -> median = (7.668+8.723)/2 = 8.1955\n    hour18: [9.004, 5.698, 7.668, 10.552] -> sorted: [5.698, 7.668, 9.004, 10.552] -> median = (7.668+9.004)/2 = 8.336\n    hour19: [9.497, 2.884, 7.738, 10.622] -> sorted: [2.884, 7.738, 9.497, 10.622] -> median = (7.738+9.497)/2 = 8.6175\n    hour20: [9.778, 2.251, 8.512, 11.326] -> sorted: [2.251, 8.512, 9.778, 11.326] -> median = (8.512+9.778)/2 = 9.145\n    hour21: [9.426, 5.065, 7.879, 9.356] -> sorted: [5.065, 7.879, 9.356, 9.426] -> median = (7.879+9.356)/2 = 8.6175\n    hour22: [8.160, 5.768, 7.457, 8.864] -> sorted: [5.768, 7.457, 8.160, 8.864] -> median = (7.457+8.160)/2 = 7.8085\n    hour23: [8.371, 5.909, 8.371, 8.723] -> sorted: [5.909, 8.371, 8.371, 8.723] -> median = (8.371+8.371)/2 = 8.371\n\n    So the median day (24 hours) is:\n\n    [8.1605, 8.231, 7.2455, 7.316, 7.527, 7.4215, 6.894, 7.2105, 7.070, 8.336, 7.879, 7.070, 7.668, 8.6525, 7.8785, 7.949, 8.512, 8.1955, 8.336, 8.6175, 9.145, 8.6175, 7.8085, 8.371]\n\n19. Now, we repeat this median day 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n20. The dates for the next 96 hours start from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 and go hourly until 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n21. We generate the dates:\n\n    2017-03-22 00:00:00\n    2017-03-22 01:00:00\n    ...\n    2017-03-22 23:00:00\n    2017-03-23 00:00:00\n    ... until 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n22. We then assign the median day values in order, repeated for 4 days.\n\n23. Format the answer as:\n\n    <answer>\n        date                 OT\n        2017-03-22 00:00:00 8.1605\n        2017-03-22 01:00:00 8.231\n        ... \n        2017-03-25 23:00:00 8.371\n    </answer>\n\n24. However, note that the original data had 2 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimals as in the input.\n\n    The input had 9.708, 9.849, etc. So we'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n25. Let's round the median values to 3 decimals:\n\n    [8.1605 -> 8.161, 8.231 -> 8.231, 7.2455 -> 7.246, 7.316 -> 7.316, 7.527 -> 7.527, 7.4215 -> 7.422, 6.894 -> 6.894, 7.2105 -> 7.211, 7.070 -> 7.070, 8.336 -> 8.336, 7.879 -> 7.879, 7.070 -> 7.070, 7.668 -> 7.668, 8.6525 -> 8.653, 7.8785 -> 7.879, 7.949 -> 7.949, 8.512 -> 8.512, 8.1955 -> 8.196, 8.336 -> 8.336, 8.6175 -> 8.618, 9.145 -> 9.145, 8.6175 -> 8.618, 7.8085 -> 7.809, 8.371 -> 8.371]\n\n26. Now, we write the data for 4 days with these 24 values repeated.\n\n27. But note: the last day (2017-03-21) had a rising trend at the end? However, we are using the median day which is an average pattern.\n\n28. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n29. Let's write the first day (2017-03-22) and then the next three days.\n\n30. We must be cautious: the dates must be in the correct order and format.\n\n31. We'll generate the dates programmatically in the answer.\n\n32.

However, it does not capture any trend or changing seasonality. Given the short data, it is a reasonable approach.\n\nIf we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model. But with only 4 days, this is a practical solution.\n",
