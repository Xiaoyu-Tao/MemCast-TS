        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hours of data (from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The user mentioned that the data will have missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, we must be cautious in the forecasting method to handle potential missing data in the training set. Since the provided data is complete, we can proceed without imputation for the training.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We note that the data is hourly.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates (from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00) in the same format.\n\n 4. We'll use a time series forecasting method. Given the data shows hourly seasonality and potential daily patterns, we can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple moving average. However, with only 96 points, we must choose a model that doesn't require too much data.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the need for seasonality, we can try to use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components. But note: 96 points is only 4 days, so we have a very short history. The seasonality might be daily (24 hours) but we only have 4 cycles.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) but with such a short history, the model might not be very stable.\n\n 7. Another approach: use an AR model with lags of 24 to capture daily seasonality. But again, we have only 4 cycles.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can use a naive seasonal method: forecast each hour of the day by the average of that hour in the past 4 days? But note the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (2016-12-27) has higher values than the first day (2016-12-24). So there might be a trend.\n\n 9. We can try to model with a linear trend and daily seasonality. However, with only 4 days, we can also consider a moving window.\n\n 10. Since the problem is complex and we are limited by the data, we can use a simple method: \n     - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n     - Extrapolate the trend linearly (or using a moving average) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 11. But note: the data has a drop on 2016-12-25 and 2016-12-26? Actually, the data seems to have daily patterns but also some irregularities.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet by Facebook, which handles seasonality and trends, and is robust to missing data. However, we are not allowed to use external libraries? We are in a text-based environment.\n\n 13. Since we are an expert, we must provide a solution. We can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour. But let's check the pattern:\n\n     For example, at hour 00:00:\n        2016-12-24: 6.753\n        2016-12-25: 6.683\n        2016-12-26: 5.206\n        2016-12-27: 6.331\n\n        Average = (6.753+6.683+5.206+6.331)/4 = 6.24325\n\n     Then for 2016-12-28 00:00:00, we can use 6.24325.\n\n     Similarly, we do for each hour of the day.\n\n 14. However, this method ignores any trend. We can also consider a weighted average where more recent days are weighted more.\n\n 15. Another idea: use the last day (2016-12-27) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? But that might be too noisy.\n\n 16. Given the short history, we'll go with the simple average for each hour of the day. This will capture the daily seasonality.\n\n 17. Steps for the forecast:\n     - We have 4 days of data, each day has 24 hours.\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the same 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 18. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n        Day 1 (2016-12-24): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        We can calculate:\n\n        Day1: 6.753, 6.261, ... -> let's compute quickly: \n            We can approximate: the values range from about 5 to 10, but we don't need exact.\n\n        Actually, we can see that the last day (2016-12-27) has higher values (e.g., 10.200, 9.849) than the first day.\n\n        So the average of the entire day is increasing? \n\n        We can account for trend? We can compute the daily average and then adjust the seasonal pattern by the trend.\n\n 19. We can do:\n        Step 1: Compute the average for each day.\n        Step 2: Compute the daily average as a time series and then extrapolate the trend for the next 4 days (using linear regression? or just the average of the daily increases?).\n        Step 3: For each hour, compute the seasonal index (as the deviation from the daily mean for that hour).\n        Step 4: For the next 4 days, for each day, we have a forecasted daily mean (from step2) and then for each hour we add the seasonal index.\n\n 20. However, with only 4 days, the trend extrapolation might be unstable.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use a moving average to remove the seasonality and then model the trend? But again, 4 days is very short.\n\n 22. Given the complexity and the short history, we decide to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour without trend adjustment. This is a simple and robust method.\n\n 23. We'll calculate the average for each hour (across the 4 days) and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 24. How to handle missing values in the training? The provided data has no missing values, so we don't need to impute.\n\n 25. Let's generate the next 96 timestamps: \n        Start: 2016-12-28 00:00:00, then hourly until 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n\n 26. We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n 27. Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Values: \n          2016-12-24 00:00:00: 6.753\n          2016-12-25 00:00:00: 6.683\n          2016-12-26 00:00:00: 5.206\n          2016-12-27 00:00:00: 6.331\n        Average = (6.753+6.683+5.206+6.331)/4 = 24.973/4 = 6.24325\n\n 28. Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n          2016-12-24 01:00:00: 6.261\n          2016-12-25 01:00:00: 6.824\n          2016-12-26 01:00:00: 5.487\n          2016-12-27 01:00:00: 6.683\n        Average = (6.261+6.824+5.487+6.683)/4 = 25.255/4 = 6.31375\n\n 29. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 30. Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern.\n\n 31. Therefore, the forecast for:\n        2016-12-28 00:00:00: 6.24325\n        2016-12-28 01:00:00: 6.31375\n        ... and so on.\n\n 32. We must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and OT) for 96 hours.\n\n 33. We note that the original data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 34. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    hour0: (6.753 + 6.683 + 5.206 + 6.331) / 4 = 6.24325 -> 6.243\n    hour1: (6.261 + 6.824 + 5.487 + 6.683) / 4 = 6.31375 -> 6.314\n    hour2: (6.894 + 7.246 + 3.377 + 7.105) / 4 = 6.1555 -> 6.156\n    But wait, let me recalc hour2: 6.894+7.246=14.14, +3.377=17.517, +7.105=24.622 -> 24.622/4=6.1555 -> 6.156\n\n    We'll do for all 24 hours.\n\n 35. However, note that the data on 2016-12-26 02:00:00 is 3.377 which is an outlier? But we are taking the average so it will be smoothed.\n\n 36. We compute the 24 values (for 0 to 23) and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 37. We'll create a list of the 24 average values.\n\n 38. Then, we generate the dates from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00 (96 hours).\n\n 39. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-28 00:00:00  6.243\n2016-12-28 01:00:00  6.314\n... \n```\n\n 40. We must be cautious: the data provided ends at 2016-12-27 23:00:00. The next hour is 2016-12-28 00:00:00.\n\n 41. Let's compute the 24:\n\n        hour0: (6.753, 6.683, 5.206, 6.331) -> 6.243\n        hour1: (6.261, 6.824, 5.487, 6.683) -> 6.314\n        hour2: (6.894, 7.246, 3.377, 7.105) -> 6.156\n        hour3: (6.753, 5.979, 2.251, 6.402) -> (6.753+5.979+2.251+6.402)/4 = 21.385/4 = 5.346\n        hour4: (6.402, 3.588, 4.854, 5.698) -> (6.402+3.588+4.854+5.698)/4 = 20.542/4 = 5.136\n        hour5: (6.753, 3.377, 4.995, 5.206) -> (6.753+3.377+4.995+5.206)/4 = 20.331/4 = 5.083\n        hour6: (6.050, 3.377, 6.050, 6.402) -> (6.050+3.377+6.050+6.402)/4 = 21.879/4 = 5.470\n        hour7: (5.909, 3.588, 6.824, 7.035) -> (5.909+3.588+6.824+7.035)/4 = 23.356/4 = 5.839\n        hour8: (5.909, 6.402, 7.175, 7.668) -> (5.909+6.402+7.175+7.668)/4 = 27.154/4 = 6.789\n        hour9: (5.487, 4.573, 8.371, 8.160) -> (5.487+4.573+8.371+8.160)/4 = 26.591/4 = 6.648\n        hour10: (5.698, 7.105, 6.542, 7.457) -> (5.698+7.105+6.542+7.457)/4 = 26.802/4 = 6.701\n        hour11: (6.050, 7.809, 6.472, 7.809) -> (6.050+7.809+6.472+7.809)/4 = 28.140/4 = 7.035\n        hour12: (5.909, 5.206, 4.432, 8.371) -> (5.909+5.206+4.432+8.371)/4 = 23.918/4 = 5.980\n        hour13: (6.261, 5.979, 4.854, 8.442) -> (6.261+5.979+4.854+8.442)/4 = 25.536/4 = 6.384\n        hour14: (5.839, 6.050, 3.588, 10.200) -> (5.839+6.050+3.588+10.200)/4 = 25.677/4 = 6.419\n        hour15: (5.839, 6.331, 3.869, 8.723) -> (5.839+6.331+3.869+8.723)/4 = 24.762/4 = 6.191\n        hour16: (6.613, 6.402, 4.150, 9.849) -> (6.613+6.402+4.150+9.849)/4 = 27.014/4 = 6.754\n        hour17: (6.824, 6.964, 5.065, 9.286) -> (6.824+6.964+5.065+9.286)/4 = 28.139/4 = 7.035\n        hour18: (6.753, 7.668, 6.964, 8.231) -> (6.753+7.668+6.964+8.231)/4 = 29.616/4 = 7.404\n        hour19: (6.613, 8.020, 7.668, 8.371) -> (6.613+8.020+7.668+8.371)/4 = 30.672/4 = 7.668\n        hour20: (6.331, 8.371, 7.386, 7.879) -> (6.331+8.371+7.386+7.879)/4 = 29.967/4 = 7.492\n        hour21: (6.191, 8.512, 7.879, 7.386) -> (6.191+8.512+7.879+7.386)/4 = 29.968/4 = 7.492\n        hour22: (7.246, 9.989, 7.668, 8.371) -> (7.246+9.989+7.668+8.371)/4 = 33.274/4 = 8.319\n        hour23: (6.894, 10.622, 8.160, 8.020) -> (6.894+10.622+8.160+8.020)/4 = 33.696/4 = 8.424\n\n 42. Now, we have 24 values for the hours 0 to 23. We'll use these for each day in the forecast period.\n\n 43. The next 4 days (2016-12-28 to 2016-12-31) will have the same pattern: \n        Day1 (2016-12-28): [6.243, 6.314, 6.156, 5.346, 5.136, 5.083, 5.470, 5.839, 6.789, 6.648, 6.701, 7.035, 5.980, 6.384, 6.419, 6.191, 6.754, 7.035, 7.404, 7.668, 7.492, 7.492, 8.319, 8.424]\n        Day2 (2016-12-29): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (2016-12-30): same\n        Day4 (2016-12-31): same\n\n 44. We output the data accordingly.\n\n 45. However, note that the original data had a trend? But we are not adjusting for trend. This is a simple seasonal naive.\n\n 46. We write the output.\n\n 47. We must round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 48. Let's write the first few lines:\n\n        2016-12-28 00:00:00  6.243\n        2016-12-28 01:00:00  6.314\n        2016-12-28 02:00:00  6.156\n        2016-12-28 03:00:00  5.346\n        2016-12-28 04:00:00  5.136\n        ...\n\n 49. We generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 50. We note: the dates must be in the correct order and format.\n\n 51. We use the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 52. We'll write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 53. We must not omit any content.\n\n 54. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 55. We double-check the calculation for one or two values.\n\n 56. We note: the method is very basic, but with the limited data and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 57. If we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model.\n\n 58. Now, we write the answer.\n",
