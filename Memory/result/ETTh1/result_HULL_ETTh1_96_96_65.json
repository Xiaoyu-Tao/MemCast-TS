        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be prepared to handle missing values in the forecasting process.\n\n 2. Since the data is a time series, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points ahead, \n    we need a model that can handle multiple-step forecasting.\n\n 3. We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, looking at the provided data, we see:\n      - The values are generally higher during the day and lower at night? But let's check:\n\n        On 2017-03-18: \n          00:00: 1.541, 01:00: 1.942, 02:00: 1.608, 03:00: 1.808, 04:00: 1.808, 05:00: 1.474, 06:00: 1.674, 07:00: 1.407, 08:00: 2.277, 09:00: 0.335, ... \n          Then at 12:00: -0.134, 18:00: -1.139, 23:00: 1.340.\n\n        On 2017-03-19: \n          00:00: 2.545, ... 09:00: -0.603, ... 18:00: -0.938, 23:00: -0.335.\n\n        There seems to be a pattern of higher values in the early hours (around 0-8) and lower values during the day (9-18) and then a slight increase at night (23:00).\n\n 4. Given the hourly data and the apparent daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24), we can use a seasonal model. However, with only 4 days of data, it's challenging to capture long seasonality.\n\n 5. We must also note that the data might have non-stationary features. We might need to difference the data or use a model that handles trends and seasonality.\n\n 6. Considering the above, we can use:\n      - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model: which can handle seasonality and non-stationarity.\n      - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which is suitable for seasonality.\n\n 7. But note: the data has negative values, so we cannot use multiplicative seasonality that requires positive data? Actually, Holt-Winters additive method can handle negative.\n\n 8. Given the small data size, we might prefer a simpler model. However, we are required to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 9. Steps for modeling:\n      a. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n      b. If non-stationary, apply differencing (both regular and seasonal).\n      c. Identify SARIMA parameters (p, d, q) and (P, D, Q) for the seasonal part (with m=24).\n\n 10. However, due to the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without the ability to run code, we must rely on a standard approach.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n        - The last 24 hours of data (from 2017-03-21 00:00 to 23:00) might be used as a base for the next day? But the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we will use a simple average of the four days for each hour? But note: the data does not show a clear consistent pattern.\n\n 13. We can also consider using an average of the same hour across the four available days and then adjust by the overall trend? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 14. Since we are to provide the forecast, we can use a model that we can fit quickly. We choose to use the Seasonal Naive method: \n        Forecast for each hour in the next day is the value of the same hour in the previous day.\n\n      However, we have 4 days of data. We can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? \n\n      Let H(t) be the hour of the day (0 to 23). Then the forecast for hour h on day 5 (2017-03-22) would be the average of hour h on day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n 15. But note: the data starts at 2017-03-18 (day1) and ends at 2017-03-21 (day4). We are to forecast 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00 (4 days).\n\n 16. How about using a moving average? We can do:\n\n        For a given hour h (0-23), the forecast for day 5 (first forecast day) is:\n            F(2017-03-22 h:00:00) = (value of 2017-03-18 h:00:00 + 2017-03-19 h:00:00 + 2017-03-20 h:00:00 + 2017-03-21 h:00:00) / 4\n\n        Then for day 6 (2017-03-23) we can use the same? But that would be the same as day5? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? Or we can use the same pattern as the last day? \n\n 17. However, we note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day1 (2017-03-18): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day2: average\n        Day3: average\n        Day4: average\n\n        We can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n          values: [1.541, 1.942, 1.608, 1.808, 1.808, 1.474, 1.674, 1.407, 2.277, 0.335, 0.268, 0.670, -0.134, 0.335, 0.737, 0.603, 0.000, -0.268, -1.139, -1.072, -1.273, -1.474, -0.402, 1.340]\n          average = (sum) / 24 = (1.541+1.942+...+1.340)/24 = 0.4045\n\n        Day2: \n          [2.545, 1.741, 2.210, 1.674, 1.541, 0.335, -0.268, -0.134, 0.536, -0.603, -0.268, 0.000, -0.737, 0.000, 0.268, 0.134, -0.536, -0.536, -0.938, -1.340, -1.340, -2.009, -1.608, -0.335]\n          average = (2.545+1.741+...-0.335)/24 = 0.000625\n\n        Day3:\n          [1.474, 1.340, 0.536, 1.942, 1.474, 0.402, -0.737, 1.273, 1.407, 0.335, 0.603, 0.067, -0.938, -0.268, -0.067, -0.871, -0.603, -0.670, -1.005, -1.005, -1.072, -1.407, 0.134, -0.469]\n          average = (1.474+1.340+...-0.469)/24 = 0.0125\n\n        Day4:\n          [0.603, 0.737, 0.000, 0.000, -0.469, 0.335, -0.335, 0.804, 1.072, -1.808, -0.670, -0.402, -1.273, 1.273, 0.268, -0.603, -1.139, -2.210, -1.541, -1.206, -1.407, -2.076, 0.335, 0.536]\n          average = (0.603+0.737+...+0.536)/24 = -0.250625\n\n        The averages are: 0.4045, 0.000625, 0.0125, -0.250625 -> a downward trend? \n\n 18. We might adjust the hourly average by the trend? But with only 4 points, it's hard to model a trend.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use a drift method? \n\n 20. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without running a full model, we decide to use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h on day (4+k) = average of the same hour h on the 4 days + k * (average of the last day - average of the first day) / (3*24) * (24*k + hour_offset) ?\n\n      This might be too complex.\n\n 21. Simpler: We use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend per day? \n\n      Step 1: Compute the average for each day (as above).\n      Step 2: Compute the daily trend: \n          trend = (average_day4 - average_day1) / (3)   [because from day1 to day4 there are 3 intervals]\n          = (-0.250625 - 0.4045) / 3 = (-0.655125) / 3 = -0.218375 per day.\n\n      Step 3: For the first forecast day (2017-03-22, which is day5), the daily level = average_day4 + trend = -0.250625 + (-0.218375) = -0.469\n              For day6: -0.469 + (-0.218375) = -0.687375\n              For day7: -0.687375 + (-0.218375) = -0.90575\n              For day8: -0.90575 + (-0.218375) = -1.124125\n\n      Step 4: For each hour h, we have a base value: base_h = (h1 + h2 + h3 + h4) / 4   [h1 from day1, h2 from day2, h3 from day3, h4 from day4]\n\n      Step 5: Then the forecast for hour h on day5: base_h + (daily_level_day5 - overall_average_of_base_h)\n\n        But note: the overall average of the base_h should be the average of the 4 days? Actually, the average of the base_h over 24 hours is the average of the 4 daily averages? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          Let A = (average_day1 + average_day2 + average_day3 + average_day4) / 4 = (0.4045+0.000625+0.0125-0.250625)/4 = 0.166/4 = 0.0415\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h on day5: base_h + (daily_level_day5 - A)\n\n        But this might not be the best.\n\n 22. Another simpler idea: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then subtract the overall trend per day? \n\n      Actually, we can model:\n\n        Forecast for hour h on day d = base_h + (d - 4) * trend_per_day   [for d=5,6,7,8]\n\n      But note: the base_h is the average for that hour, and we are adding a daily trend that is the same for all hours? \n\n      However, the daily trend we computed is the average over the day. We are assuming that each hour has the same trend? \n\n 23. We'll do:\n\n        Let base_h = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4\n\n        Then for the first forecast day (2017-03-22, which is day5, so k=1):\n            F_h = base_h + 1 * (-0.218375)\n\n        For day6 (2017-03-23, k=2): F_h = base_h + 2 * (-0.218375)\n\n        For day7 (2017-03-24, k=3): F_h = base_h + 3 * (-0.218375)\n\n        For day8 (2017-03-25, k=4): F_h = base_h + 4 * (-0.218375)\n\n 24. But note: the base_h is already centered at the average of the 4 days? And we are subtracting a constant trend per day? \n\n 25. Let's test with one hour, say hour0 (00:00):\n\n        Day1: 1.541\n        Day2: 2.545\n        Day3: 1.474\n        Day4: 0.603\n        base_0 = (1.541+2.545+1.474+0.603)/4 = 6.163/4 = 1.54075\n\n        Then forecast for 2017-03-22 00:00:00: 1.54075 + 1*(-0.218375) = 1.322375\n        for 2017-03-23 00:00:00: 1.54075 + 2*(-0.218375) = 1.104\n        ... \n\n 26. However, we note that the trend we computed is the average daily change. But the base_h is for the hour0, and the trend we are applying is the same for every hour? \n\n 27. This method might be acceptable given the simplicity.\n\n 28. But note: the trend we computed is from the daily averages. The daily averages are:\n\n        day1: 0.4045\n        day2: 0.000625\n        day3: 0.0125\n        day4: -0.250625\n\n        The linear trend: we can fit a linear regression to these 4 points? \n\n        Let x = [0,1,2,3] for day1, day2, day3, day4, and y = [0.4045, 0.000625, 0.0125, -0.250625]\n\n        We want y = a + b*x\n\n        We can compute b (slope) and a (intercept) by:\n\n          n = 4\n          sum_x = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n          sum_y = 0.4045+0.000625+0.0125-0.250625 = 0.167\n          sum_xy = 0*0.4045 + 1*0.000625 + 2*0.0125 + 3*(-0.250625) = 0 + 0.000625 + 0.025 - 0.751875 = -0.72625\n          sum_x2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n          b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2) \n            = (4*(-0.72625) - 6*0.167) / (4*14 - 36)\n            = (-2.905 - 1.002) / (56-36)\n            = (-3.907) / 20 = -0.19535\n\n          a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (0.167 - (-0.19535)*6) / 4 = (0.167 + 1.1721) / 4 = 1.3391/4 = 0.334775\n\n        So the trend per day is b = -0.19535.\n\n        Then for day5 (x=4): y5 = a + b*4 = 0.334775 -0.19535*4 = 0.334775 - 0.7814 = -0.446625\n        day6 (x=5): y6 = 0.334775 -0.19535*5 = 0.334775 - 0.97675 = -0.641975\n        day7: x=6 -> 0.334775 - 1.1721 = -0.837325\n        day8: x=7 -> 0.334775 - 1.36745 = -1.032675\n\n        Then the adjustment for each hour h on day d (d=5,6,7,8) would be: \n            F_h = base_h + (y_d - (a + b*(d-1)))   ??? \n\n        Actually, we have the base_h which is the average of the 4 days. The average of the 4 days in terms of the linear model is:\n\n          average of the 4 days = (y0+y1+y2+y3)/4 = 0.167/4 = 0.04175\n\n        Then we can adjust by: F_h = base_h + (y_d - 0.04175)\n\n        For day5: F_h = base_h + (-0.446625 - 0.04175) = base_h - 0.488375\n        day6: base_h + (-0.641975 - 0.04175) = base_h - 0.683725\n        day7: base_h - 0.879075\n        day8: base_h - 1.074425\n\n 29. This adjustment is too drastic? For example, for hour0:\n\n        base_0 = 1.54075\n        day5: 1.54075 - 0.488375 = 1.052375\n        But the actual hour0 values were: 1.541, 2.545, 1.474, 0.603 -> the last one was 0.603, so 1.05 is in the range.\n\n 30. We'll go with this method.\n\n 31. Steps:\n\n      a. For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute base_h = average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n      b. Compute the daily averages for the 4 days: [0.4045, 0.000625, 0.0125, -0.250625]\n\n      c. Fit a linear trend to these daily averages: \n            x = [0,1,2,3] (for day1, day2, day4)\n            y = [0.4045, 0.000625, 0.0125, -0.250625]\n\n        We already computed:\n            slope b = -0.19535\n            intercept a = 0.334775\n\n      d. The overall average of the 4 days: total_sum = 0.4045+0.000625+0.0125-0.250625 = 0.167, so average = 0.167/4 = 0.04175.\n\n      e. For each day in the forecast (day5, day6, day7, day8) which correspond to x=4,5,6,7:\n\n            y4 = a + b*4 = 0.334775 -0.19535*4 = -0.446625\n            y5 = a + b*5 = 0.334775 -0.19535*5 = -0.641975\n            y6 = a + b*6 = 0.334775 -0.19535*6 = -0.837325\n            y7 = a + b*7 = 0.334775 -0.19535*7 = -1.032675\n\n      f. Then for a given hour h and forecast day d (where d=5,6,7,8):\n\n            forecast = base_h + (y_{d-1} - 0.04175)\n\n        Note: because the base_h is the average over the 4 days (which had an average of 0.04175), we are adjusting by the difference between the forecasted daily average for the new day and the historical average.\n\n 32. But note: the base_h is the average for that hour, and we are adding a daily adjustment that is the same for every hour in that day? \n\n 33. We compute base_h for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.541+2.545+1.474+0.603)/4 = 6.163/4 = 1.54075\n        hour1: (1.942+1.741+1.340+0.737)/4 = (1.942+1.741=3.683, +1.340=5.023, +0.737=5.76) -> 5.76/4=1.44\n        ... \n\n 34. We must compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 35. Given the time, we will compute the base_h for each hour and then the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 36. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-22 00:00:00 (which is the next after 2017-03-21 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-03-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-25 23:00:00 (96 hours).\n\n 37. We'll create a table for base_h for hour0 to hour23.\n\n 38. Let's compute base_h:\n\n        hour0: (1.541, 2.545, 1.474, 0.603) -> 1.54075\n        hour1: (1.942, 1.741, 1.340, 0.737) -> (1.942+1.741=3.683, 3.683+1.340=5.023, 5.023+0.737=5.76) -> 5.76/4=1.44\n        hour2: (1.608, 2.210, 0.536, 0.000) -> (1.608+2.210=3.818, +0.536=4.354, +0=4.354) -> 4.354/4=1.0885\n        hour3: (1.808, 1.674, 1.942, 0.000) -> (1.808+1.674=3.482, +1.942=5.424, +0=5.424) -> 5.424/4=1.356\n        hour4: (1.808, 1.541, 1.474, -0.469) -> (1.808+1.541=3.349, +1.474=4.823, -0.469=4.354) -> 4.354/4=1.0885\n        hour5: (1.474, 0.335, 0.402, 0.335) -> (1.474+0.335=1.809, +0.402=2.211, +0.335=2.546) -> 2.546/4=0.6365\n        hour6: (1.674, -0.268, -0.737, -0.335) -> (1.674-0.268=1.406, -0.737=0.669, -0.335=0.334) -> 0.334/4=0.0835\n        hour7: (1.407, -0.134, 1.273, 0.804) -> (1.407-0.134=1.273, +1.273=2.546, +0.804=3.35) -> 3.35/4=0.8375\n        hour8: (2.277, 0.536, 1.407, 1.072) -> (2.277+0.536=2.813, +1.407=4.22, +1.072=5.292) -> 5.292/4=1.323\n        hour9: (0.335, -0.603, 0.335, -1.808) -> (0.335-0.603=-0.268, +0.335=0.067, -1.808=-1.741) -> -1.741/4=-0.43525\n        hour10: (0.268, -0.268, 0.603, -0.670) -> (0.268-0.268=0, +0.603=0.603, -0.670=-0.067) -> -0.067/4=-0.01675\n        hour11: (0.670, 0.000, 0.067, -0.402) -> (0.670+0=0.670, +0.067=0.737, -0.402=0.335) -> 0.335/4=0.08375\n        hour12: (-0.134, -0.737, -0.938, -1.273) -> (-0.134-0.737=-0.871, -0.938=-1.809, -1.273=-3.082) -> -3.082/4=-0.7705\n        hour13: (0.335, 0.000, -0.268, 1.273) -> (0.335+0=0.335, -0.268=0.067, +1.273=1.34) -> 1.34/4=0.335\n        hour14: (0.737, 0.268, -0.067, 0.268) -> (0.737+0.268=1.005, -0.067=0.938, +0.268=1.206) -> 1.206/4=0.3015\n        hour15: (0.603, 0.134, -0.871, -0.603) -> (0.603+0.134=0.737, -0.871=-0.134, -0.603=-0.737) -> -0.737/4=-0.18425\n        hour16: (0.000, -0.536, -0.603, -1.139) -> (0-0.536=-0.536, -0.603=-1.139, -1.139=-2.278) -> -2.278/4=-0.5695\n        hour17: (-0.268, -0.536, -0.670, -2.210) -> (-0.268-0.536=-0.804, -0.670=-1.474, -2.210=-3.684) -> -3.684/4=-0.921\n        hour18: (-1.139, -0.938, -1.005, -1.541) -> (-1.139-0.938=-2.077, -1.005=-3.082, -1.541=-4.623) -> -4.623/4=-1.15575\n        hour19: (-1.072, -1.340, -1.005, -1.206) -> (-1.072-1.340=-2.412, -1.005=-3.417, -1.206=-4.623) -> -4.623/4=-1.15575\n        hour20: (-1.273, -1.340, -1.072, -1.407) -> (-1.273-1.340=-2.613, -1.072=-3.685, -1.407=-5.092) -> -5.092/4=-1.273\n        hour21: (-1.474, -2.009, -1.407, -2.076) -> (-1.474-2.009=-3.483, -1.407=-4.89, -2.076=-6.966) -> -6.966/4=-1.7415\n        hour22: (-0.402, -1.608, 0.134, 0.335) -> (-0.402-1.608=-2.01, +0.134=-1.876, +0.335=-1.541) -> -1.541/4=-0.38525\n        hour23: (1.340, -0.335, -0.469, 0.536) -> (1.340-0.335=1.005, -0.469=0.536, +0.536=1.072) -> 1.072/4=0.268\n\n 39. Now, the daily levels for the forecast days:\n\n        day5 (2017-03-22): y4 = -0.446625\n        day6 (2017-03-23): y5 = -0.641975\n        day7 (2017-03-24): y6 = -0.837325\n        day8 (2017-03-25): y7 = -1.032675\n\n        The historical average of the 4 days: 0.04175\n\n        Adjustment for day5: -0.446625 - 0.04175 = -0.488375\n        day6: -0.641975 - 0.04175 = -0.683725\n        day7: -0.837325 - 0.04175 = -0.879075\n        day8: -1.032675 - 0.04175 = -1.074425\n\n 40. Then for each hour in the forecast:\n\n        For 2017-03-22 (day5): \n            hour0: 1.54075 + (-0.488375) = 1.052375\n            hour1: 1.44 + (-0.488375) = 0.951625\n            ... \n\n 41. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 42. We'll generate:\n\n        Day5: 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-22 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day6: 2017-03-23 00:00:00 to 2017-03-23 23:00:00\n        Day7: 2017-03-24 00:00:00 to 2017-03-24 23:00:00\n        Day8: 2017-03-25 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00\n\n 43. We'll write a loop for the 4 days, and for each hour in 0..23, compute:\n\n        value = base_h[hour] + adjustment[day_index]\n\n        where adjustment[0] = -0.488375 (for day5)\n              adjustment[1] = -0.683725 (for day6)\n              adjustment[2] = -0.879075 (for day7)\n              adjustment[3] = -1.074425 (for day8)\n\n 44. We must be cautious: the base_h we computed is for hour0 to hour23.\n\n 45. Let's code the base_h as a list:\n\n        base_h = [\n            1.54075,  # hour0\n            1.44,     # hour1\n            1.0885,   # hour2\n            1.356,    # hour3\n            1.0885,   # hour4\n            0.6365,   # hour5\n            0.0835,   # hour6\n            0.8375,   # hour7\n            1.323,    # hour8\n            -0.43525, # hour9\n            -0.01675, # hour10\n            0.08375,  # hour11\n            -0.7705,  # hour12\n            0.335,    # hour13\n            0.3015,   # hour14\n            -0.18425, # hour15\n            -0.5695,  # hour16\n            -0.921,   # hour17\n            -1.15575, # hour18\n            -1.15575, # hour19\n            -1.273,   # hour20\n            -1.7415,  # hour21\n            -0.38525, # hour22\n            0.268     # hour23\n        ]\n\n 46. Now, we generate the dates: starting from 2017-03-22 00:00:00, then 2017-03-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n 47. We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        date, HULL\n\n 48. We'll round the HULL values to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places.\n\n 49. Let's do:\n\n        For day_index in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + day_index*24 + hour\n                value = base_h[hour] + [ -0.488375, -0.683725, -0.879075, -1.074425 ][day_index]\n\n                # round to 3 decimals\n                value = round(value, 3)\n\n 50. The start_date is 2017-03-22 00:00:00.\n\n 51. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        day0: 2017-03-22\n        day1: 2017-03-23\n        day2: 2017-03-24\n        day3: 2017-03-25\n\n 52. We must be careful: the original data ended at 2017-03-21 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-03-22 00:00:00.\n\n 53. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 54. However, note: the user said the data will have missing values, but we are not given any in the input. We are forecasting without filling any missing values in the input because the input provided is complete.\n\n 55. We output the forecast.\n\n 56. Let's do the first few:\n\n        Day0 (2017-03-22):\n          hour0: 1.54075 - 0.488375 = 1.052375 -> 1.052\n          hour1: 1.44 - 0.488375 = 0.951625 -> 0.952\n          hour2: 1.0885 - 0.488375 = 0.600125 -> 0.600\n          hour3: 1.356 - 0.488375 = 0.867625 -> 0.868\n          hour4: 1.0885 - 0.488375 = 0.600125 -> 0.600\n          hour5: 0.6365 - 0.488375 = 0.148125 -> 0.148\n          hour6: 0.0835 - 0.488375 = -0.404875 -> -0.405\n          hour7: 0.8375 - 0.488375 = 0.349125 -> 0.349\n          hour8: 1.323 - 0.488375 = 0.834625 -> 0.835\n          hour9: -0.43525 - 0.488375 = -0.923625 -> -0.924\n          hour10: -0.01675 - 0.488375 = -0.505125 -> -0.505\n          hour11: 0.08375 - 0.488375 = -0.404625 -> -0.405\n          hour12: -0.7705 - 0.488375 = -1.258875 -> -1.259\n          hour13: 0.335 - 0.488375 = -0.153375 -> -0.153\n          hour14: 0.3015 - 0.488375 = -0.186875 -> -0.187\n          hour15: -0.18425 - 0.488375 = -0.672625 -> -0.673\n          hour16: -0.5695 - 0.488375 = -1.057875 -> -1.058\n          hour17: -0.921 - 0.488375 = -1.409375 -> -1.409\n          hour18: -1.15575 - 0.488375 = -1.644125 -> -1.644\n          hour19: -1.15575 - 0.488375 = -1.644125 -> -1.644\n          hour20: -1.273 - 0.488375 = -1.761375 -> -1.761\n          hour21: -1.7415 - 0.488375 = -2.229875 -> -2.230\n          hour22: -0.38525 - 0.488375 = -0.873625 -> -0.874\n          hour23: 0.268 - 0.488375 = -0.220375 -> -0.220\n\n 57. Then for day1 (2017-03-23): subtract 0.683725 from base_h, etc.\n\n 58. We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 59. We must be cautious: the adjustment for each day is fixed per day.\n\n 60. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 61. Due to the length, we'll write a program in our mind to generate the 96 points.\n\n 62. We'll list the adjustments per day:\n\n        day0: -0.488375\n        day1: -0.683725\n        day2: -0.879075\n        day3: -1.074425\n\n 63. And the base_h for each hour (0-23) as above.\n\n 64. We generate:\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                value = base_h[hour] + [ -0.488375, -0.683725, -0.879075, -1.074425 ][day]\n                value = round(value, 3)\n\n 65. We then format the date accordingly.\n\n 66. The first date: 2017-03-22 00:00:00, then 2017-03-22 01:00:00, ... 2017-03-22 23:00:00, then 2017-03-23 00:00:00, etc.\n\n 67. We'll write the data in a table.\n\n 68. Since the output must be complete, we are to provide 96 lines.\n\n 69. We do the computation and output.\n\n 70. Note: We are aware that this is a simple method and might not be the most accurate, but given the constraints it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 71. Let's output the data.\n",
