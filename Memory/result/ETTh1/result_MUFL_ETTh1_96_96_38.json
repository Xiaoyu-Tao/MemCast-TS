        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (as per the given data).\n 3. We must choose an appropriate time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, \n    we can consider models that capture daily seasonality (seasonality of 24 hours).\n\n However, note that the data only spans 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history for training a model with daily seasonality (which requires at least 2 cycles to estimate).\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we can use a simple model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any) but the trend over 4 days might be minimal.\n    - Seasonality: we assume a daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a model like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality).\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour across the available days and then add a small adjustment for the most recent trend.\n\n 7. However, note that the data shows some variation and the last day (2016-12-03) has a spike at 23:00 (11.122) and then the next day starts at 12.224, which is higher than the previous days.\n\n 8. Considering the limited data, we can use the following approach:\n    - Calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days.\n    - But note: the first day (2016-11-30) is a Wednesday, then Thursday, Friday, Saturday. The next 96 hours would be from Sunday (2016-12-04) to Wednesday (2016-12-07). \n      There might be weekly patterns, but we don't have enough data for weekly seasonality.\n\n 9. Since we only have 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours). However, we must account for the fact that the last day (Saturday) might have a pattern that is different from the upcoming Sunday.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour. But with only 4 points per hour, it's very limited.\n\n 11. Given the challenge, we can use the following:\n     - We'll use the average of each hour across the 4 days, but we can also consider a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights.\n\n 12. Weights: assign weights in increasing order: day1 (2016-11-30): weight=1, day2: weight=2, day3: weight=3, day4: weight=4.\n\n 13. For each hour (0 to 23), we calculate:\n        forecast_hour = (value_day1 + 2*value_day2 + 3*value_day3 + 4*value_day4) / (1+2+3+4) = (value_day1 + 2*value_day2 + 3*value_day3 + 4*value_day4) / 10\n\n 14. Then we use this forecast_hour for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 15. However, note that the next 96 hours are 4 days: 2016-12-04 (Sunday) to 2016-12-07 (Wednesday). We don't have Sunday in the history, so we are using a weighted average of Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat for Sunday? \n     This might not be ideal, but we have no other data.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the pattern for Sunday? But that is also not necessarily true.\n\n 17. Given the constraints, we must produce a forecast. We'll use the weighted average method for each hour.\n\n 18. Steps for calculation:\n     - We have 4 days: \n          day0: 2016-11-30 (Wednesday) -> index 0 to 23\n          day1: 2016-12-01 (Thursday) -> index 24 to 47\n          day2: 2016-12-02 (Friday) -> index 48 to 71\n          day3: 2016-12-03 (Saturday) -> index 72 to 95\n\n     - For hour h (0<=h<=23):\n          value0 = data[h]   (from day0)\n          value1 = data[24+h] (from day1)\n          value2 = data[48+h] (from day2)\n          value3 = data[72+h] (from day3)\n\n          forecast_h = (value0 + 2*value1 + 3*value2 + 4*value3) / 10\n\n     - Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n          day4 (Sunday): hours 0 to 23 -> forecast_0, forecast_1, ... forecast_23\n          day5 (Monday): hours 0 to 23 -> same forecast_0, ... forecast_23 (but note: we are using the same pattern for each day? but the problem doesn't specify weekly seasonality and we don't have enough data to capture weekly)\n\n     However, this would repeat the same pattern for each of the next 4 days. But the pattern might change by day of week? We don't have data to support that.\n\n 19. Since we don't have multiple weeks, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we assume that the pattern is daily and the same for every day.\n\n 20. Therefore, we will use the same set of 24 forecasted hours for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 21. But note: the last day (Saturday) had a spike at hour 23 (11.122) and the next day (Sunday) might be different? However, without weekly data, we have to assume the pattern is consistent.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use a simple model: use the last day (Saturday) as the forecast for the next day (Sunday), then use the weighted average for the subsequent days? But the problem asks for 96 hours.\n\n 23. We decide to use the weighted average for each hour and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 24. However, we must also consider that there might be a trend. The overall level of the time series might be increasing. We can adjust the level by taking the last few days and projecting a trend.\n\n 25. Let's compute the average of each day:\n        day0: 6.50 (approx)\n        day1: 6.20\n        day2: 6.60\n        day3: 7.20 (because of the spike at the end)\n\n     There might be an increasing trend? But 4 points are too few. We can compute a linear regression on the daily averages.\n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use Holt-Winters method that can capture trend and seasonality. But with only 4 days, the estimation of trend and seasonality might be unstable.\n\n 27. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide an answer, we will proceed with the weighted average per hour and then adjust the entire forecast by a trend factor.\n\n 28. Steps for trend adjustment:\n     - Compute the daily averages:\n          day0: average of indices 0-23 -> 6.50 (exact: 6.50)\n          day1: 24-47 -> 6.20\n          day2: 48-71 -> 6.60\n          day3: 72-95 -> 7.20\n\n     - Fit a linear trend to these 4 points: \n          x = [0,1,2,3] (days)\n          y = [6.50, 6.20, 6.60, 7.20]\n\n     - The linear regression: y = a + b*x\n          n = 4\n          sum_x = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n          sum_y = 6.50+6.20+6.60+7.20 = 26.5\n          sum_xy = 0*6.50 + 1*6.20 + 2*6.60 + 3*7.20 = 0 + 6.20 + 13.20 + 21.60 = 41.0\n          sum_x2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n          b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2) \n            = (4*41.0 - 6*26.5) / (4*14 - 36) = (164 - 159) / (56-36) = 5/20 = 0.25\n\n          a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (26.5 - 0.25*6) / 4 = (26.5-1.5)/4 = 25/4 = 6.25\n\n     - So the trend line: y = 6.25 + 0.25*x\n\n     - The next 4 days correspond to x = 4,5,6,7.\n\n        day4 (x=4): 6.25 + 0.25*4 = 7.25\n        day5 (x=5): 6.25 + 0.25*5 = 7.50\n        day6 (x=6): 6.25 + 0.25*6 = 7.75\n        day7 (x=7): 6.25 + 0.25*7 = 8.00\n\n     - Now, we have the daily level for the next 4 days.\n\n 29. We also have the base pattern (the 24 hours) from the weighted average. Let the base pattern for hour h be P_h (the weighted average we computed).\n\n 30. The daily average of the base pattern P is the average of P_h for h in 0..23. Let that be M.\n\n 31. Then for day i (i=4,5,6,7) and hour h, the forecast is:\n        F_{i,h} = P_h * (level_i / M)\n\n 32. This will adjust the base pattern to the projected daily level.\n\n 33. Steps in detail:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the weighted average for each hour (h from 0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n        P_h = (D0_h + 2*D1_h + 3*D2_h + 4*D3_h) / 10\n\n     Step 2: Compute the average of P_h over 24 hours, call it M.\n\n     Step 3: For each day in the future (i=4,5,6,7) and for each hour h in 0..23:\n        F_{i,h} = P_h * (level_i / M)\n\n     where level_i is the daily level we projected for that day (7.25, 7.50, 7.75, 8.00).\n\n 34. But note: the base pattern M is the average of the weighted average pattern. We can compute M as:\n        M = (sum_{h=0}^{23} P_h) / 24\n\n 35. Let's compute the base pattern and M.\n\n 36. However, note: the data we have is for 4 days, and we are using a weighted average. We must compute P_h for each hour.\n\n 37. We'll do the calculation for each hour.\n\n 38. But note: the data provided is exactly 96 points. We can index them.\n\n 39. We'll create arrays for the 4 days.\n\n 40. Let's compute:\n\n     Hour 0:\n        D0: 8.351, D1: 8.848, D2: 7.143, D3: 12.224\n        P0 = (8.351 + 2*8.848 + 3*7.143 + 4*12.224) / 10 \n            = (8.351 + 17.696 + 21.429 + 48.896) / 10 = 96.372 / 10 = 9.6372\n\n     Hour 1:\n        D0: 9.950, D1: 8.209, D2: 6.787, D3: 12.153\n        P1 = (9.950 + 2*8.209 + 3*6.787 + 4*12.153) / 10\n            = (9.950 + 16.418 + 20.361 + 48.612) / 10 = 95.341 / 10 = 9.5341\n\n     ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n 41. Then we compute M = (P0+P1+...+P23)/24.\n\n 42. Then for the first forecast day (Sunday, 2016-12-04) we use level=7.25, so each hour h: F_h = P_h * (7.25 / M)\n\n     Similarly, for Monday: F_h = P_h * (7.50 / M)\n            Tuesday: F_h = P_h * (7.75 / M)\n            Wednesday: F_h = P_h * (8.00 / M)\n\n 43. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 44. However, note: the trend we computed was on the daily averages of the original data. The base pattern P_h is a weighted average and its average M might not be the same as the average of the original 4 days? \n     But we are using it as a template.\n\n 45. Let's compute the daily averages of the original data to check:\n\n        day0: [8.351, 6.787] -> 24 points: \n            sum0 = 8.351+9.950+7.995+8.209+9.772+9.737+7.995+10.021+7.711+5.082+5.472+6.432+4.762+4.726+5.295+4.868+5.224+6.183+5.508+5.508+4.904+4.300+5.899+6.787\n            = 155.99 -> average = 155.99/24 = 6.49958\n\n        day1: 8.848+8.209+8.777+8.564+8.280+8.528+8.102+8.102+7.604+6.681+6.112+6.290+4.548+4.868+5.472+6.432+5.863+6.290+5.472+5.259+4.904+4.513+5.046+6.965\n            = 148.78 -> average = 148.78/24 = 6.19917\n\n        day2: 7.143+6.787+6.823+6.858+4.975+8.422+8.386+7.924+5.543+5.472+6.361+6.681+4.122+5.472+5.579+5.046+5.543+5.828+5.472+5.437+5.046+5.472+7.924+11.122\n            = 158.44 -> average = 158.44/24 = 6.60167\n\n        day3: 12.224+12.153+11.265+11.762+11.442+10.234+5.508+11.051+11.194+6.432+6.041+6.645+4.193+5.046+5.828+5.970+5.295+5.543+5.330+5.224+4.620+4.122+6.681+9.452\n            = 172.85 -> average = 172.85/24 = 7.20208\n\n     The daily averages: [6.49958, 6.19917, 6.60167, 7.20208] -> which we used to get the trend.\n\n 46. Now, we compute the base pattern P_h for 24 hours and then the average M of P_h.\n\n 47. We do the calculation for all 24 hours. We'll write a small program in our mind or use a calculator.\n\n 48.

Now, the projected daily levels for the next 4 days (from the linear trend) are:\n        day4 (x=4): 7.25\n        day5 (x=5): 7.50\n        day6 (x=6): 7.75\n        day7 (x=7): 8.00\n\n 52. Then for each hour in day4 (which is the first forecast day, 2016-12-04, Sunday) we do:\n        F_h = P_h * (7.25 / 6.972845833) = P_h * 1.0397 (approx)\n\n        Let's compute the factor for each day:\n          day4: factor4 = 7.25 / 6.972845833 = 1.0397\n          day5: factor5 = 7.50 / 6.972845833 = 1.0755\n          day6: factor6 = 7.75 / 6.972845833 = 1.1113\n          day7: factor7 = 8.00 / 6.972845833 = 1.1471\n\n 53. Now, we generate the 96 points:\n\n        Day4: 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-04 23:00:00\n            h0: 9.6372 * 1.0397 = 10.02\n            h1: 9.5341 * 1.0397 = 9.91\n            ... and so on.\n\n        Day5: 2016-12-05 00:00:00 to 2016-12-05 23:00:00: multiply P_h by 1.0755\n        Day6: 2016-12-06 00:00:00 to 2016-12-06 23:00:00: multiply by 1.1113\n        Day7: 2016-12-07 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00: multiply by 1.1471\n\n 54. We must format the dates accordingly. The last date in the input is 2016-12-03 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        2016-12-04 00:00:00\n        2016-12-04 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-12-07 23:00:00\n\n 55. We'll compute each value and round to 3 decimal places (as the input).\n\n 56. However, note: the input has 3 decimal places, but we must be cautious because the factors are approximate.\n\n 57. We'll compute the factors:\n\n        factor4 = 7.25 / 6.972845833 = 1.0397 (exactly: 7.25 / 6.972845833 = 1.0397)\n        Let me calculate more precisely:\n          7.25 / 6.972845833 = 1.0397 (we'll use 1.0397)\n\n        But to be precise, we can use the exact value in calculation.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          factor4 = 7.25 / M\n          factor5 = 7.50 / M\n          factor6 = 7.75 / M\n          factor7 = 8.00 / M\n\n        and use M=167.3483/24 = 6.972845833\n\n        So:\n          factor4 = 7.25 / 6.972845833 = 1.0397 (we'll use 1.0397 for day4, but we can use the exact value in code)\n\n        However, we are doing by hand. We'll use:\n\n          factor4 = 1.0397\n          factor5 = 1.0755\n          factor6 = 1.1113\n          factor7 = 1.1471\n\n        But let me compute factor4 exactly: 7.25 / 6.972845833 = 1.0397 (rounded to 4 decimals) -> so we use 1.0397.\n\n 58. Now, we compute the 96 values.\n\n 59. We'll do the first day (day4) as an example:\n\n        h0: 9.6372 * 1.0397 = 10.02 (rounded to 3 decimals) -> 10.020\n        h1: 9.5341 * 1.0397 = 9.91 (9.5341*1.0397 = 9.91) -> 9.910\n        Let me compute: 9.5341 * 1.0397 = 9.5341 * (1 + 0.0397) = 9.5341 + 9.5341*0.0397 = 9.5341 + 0.3785 = 9.9126 -> 9.913\n\n        We'll do proper rounding.\n\n 60. We must do this for all 24 hours and then for 4 days.\n\n 61. Given the time, we will write a table for the base pattern and then multiply by the factors.\n\n 62. We'll list the base pattern P_h (with 4 decimals) and then the 4 days.\n\n 63. But note: the answer must be in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-04 00:00:00  <value>\n2016-12-04 01:00:00  <value>\n...\n2016-12-07 23:00:00  <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 64. We'll compute the values and round to 3 decimals.\n\n 65. Base pattern (P_h) for 24 hours:\n\n        h0: 9.6372\n        h1: 9.5341\n        h2: 9.1078\n        h3: 9.2959\n        h4: 8.7025\n        h5: 9.2995\n        h6: 7.1389\n        h7: 9.4201\n        h8: 8.4324\n        h9: 6.0588\n        h10: 6.0943\n        h11: 6.5635\n        h12: 4.2996\n        h13: 5.1062\n        h14: 5.6288\n        h15: 5.675\n        h16: 5.4759\n        h17: 5.8419\n        h18: 5.4188\n        h19: 5.3233\n        h20: 4.833\n        h21: 4.623\n        h22: 6.6487\n        h23: 9.1891\n\n 66.
