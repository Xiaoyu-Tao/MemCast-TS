        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 to 2017-06-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we have to use the given 96 points to forecast the next 96.\n\n 2. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily seasonality (24 hours). Also, we might consider weekly patterns but we only have 4 days.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple seasonal naive.\n\n 4. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed with the need to impute if necessary? But for forecasting, we are only given 96 points without gaps.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the forecast, we can choose a model. Let's use a simple approach: \n    - We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? \n    - Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet or SARIMA.\n\n 6. Since we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code, we have to rely on a method that we can describe. However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 7. We are to output the next 96 timestamps and their forecasted OT values.\n\n 8. Considering the constraints, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n    - The last available day (2017-06-25) has 24 hours. We can use the pattern of that day for the next day? But note that the temperature pattern might change.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days? But 4 days is very short.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the last 24 hours (the day of 2017-06-25) and adjust by the trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 11. Given the data, we observe that the temperature has a daily cycle: \n     - It dips during the night and rises during the day.\n\n 12. We can try to compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then use that pattern for the next 4 days? But note that the next 4 days might have a different base level.\n\n 13. We can also consider a linear trend over the 4 days and then project the daily pattern.\n\n 14. However, without being able to run code, we have to make a reasonable estimate.\n\n 15. Let me try to compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     Hour 0: (17.938 + 17.726999 + 19.063999 + 21.245001) / 4 = (17.938+17.727+19.064+21.245) / 4 = 75.974/4 = 18.9935\n     ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n 16. But note: the data shows a slight increase in the base level? Let's see the daily average:\n\n     2017-06-22: average = (17.938+17.657+...+17.445999)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n        We see values from 17 to 23 -> average around 19.5?\n     2017-06-23: similar, but note the last day (2017-06-25) has higher values? \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-06-25) as the pattern and then adjust by the overall trend of the 4 days? \n\n 18. We can compute the daily average for each day:\n\n     Day1 (2017-06-22): \n        sum = 17.938+17.657+17.657+16.883+17.516+18.15+18.29+18.994+20.33+20.682+21.315+22.3+21.948+22.511+23.355+21.245+20.19+19.134+19.064+18.853+18.501+17.798+17.868+17.446\n        Let me calculate step by step:\n\n        We can group: \n          Night: 17.938+17.657+17.657+16.883+17.516+18.15 = 106.801\n          Morning: 18.29+18.994+20.33+20.682+21.315+22.3 = 121.911\n          Afternoon: 21.948+22.511+23.355+21.245+20.19+19.134 = 128.383\n          Evening: 19.064+18.853+18.501+17.798+17.868+17.446 = 109.53\n\n        Total = 106.801+121.911+128.383+109.53 = 466.625\n        Average = 466.625/24 = 19.4427\n\n     Day2 (2017-06-23): \n        ... similarly, but to save time, we can do:\n\n        We have 24 values: \n          17.726999, 17.305, 17.094, 18.079, 17.305, 17.305, 17.446, 17.868, 17.868, 17.727, 16.672, 17.165, 18.923, 19.205, 20.401, 22.933, 21.456, 20.963, 20.893, 20.471, 19.205, 18.923, 19.486, 18.501\n\n        Let me add: \n          Night: 17.727+17.305+17.094+18.079+17.305+17.305 = 104.815\n          Morning: 17.446+17.868+17.868+17.727+16.672+17.165 = 104.746\n          Afternoon: 18.923+19.205+20.401+22.933+21.456+20.963 = 123.881\n          Evening: 20.893+20.471+19.205+18.923+19.486+18.501 = 117.479\n\n        Total = 104.815+104.746+123.881+117.479 = 450.921\n        Average = 450.921/24 = 18.788375\n\n     Day3 (2017-06-24): \n        Values: 19.064, 18.783, 18.501, 18.079, 18.783, 18.923, 18.712, 18.783, 19.979, 20.612, 20.682, 20.19, 21.104, 21.034, 21.385, 22.441, 21.878, 22.089, 21.737, 22.089, 21.034, 21.034, 20.963, 21.385\n\n        Night: 19.064+18.783+18.501+18.079+18.783+18.923 = 112.133\n        Morning: 18.712+18.783+19.979+20.612+20.682+20.19 = 118.958\n        Afternoon: 21.104+21.034+21.385+22.441+21.878+22.089 = 129.931\n        Evening: 21.737+22.089+21.034+21.034+20.963+21.385 = 128.242\n\n        Total = 112.133+118.958+129.931+128.242 = 489.264\n        Average = 20.386\n\n     Day4 (2017-06-25): \n        Values: 21.245, 21.526, 21.526, 21.737, 20.682, 21.456, 21.878, 21.667, 21.737, 20.963, 21.104, 21.315, 20.541, 21.034, 21.526, 21.737, 21.667, 21.385, 21.737, 21.174, 20.612, 21.034, 21.456, 20.752\n\n        Night: 21.245+21.526+21.526+21.737+20.682+21.456 = 128.172\n        Morning: 21.878+21.667+21.737+20.963+21.104+21.315 = 128.664\n        Afternoon: 20.541+21.034+21.526+21.737+21.667+21.385 = 127.89\n        Evening: 21.737+21.174+20.612+21.034+21.456+20.752 = 126.765\n\n        Total = 128.172+128.664+127.89+126.765 = 511.491\n        Average = 21.312125\n\n     The daily averages: \n        2017-06-22: 19.44\n        2017-06-23: 18.79\n        2017-06-24: 20.39\n        2017-06-25: 21.31\n\n     There is an increasing trend? \n\n     We can fit a linear regression on the daily averages:\n\n        Day 1: 19.44\n        Day 2: 18.79 -> drop? \n        Day 3: 20.39\n        Day 4: 21.31\n\n     The trend is not linear? But we only have 4 points.\n\n 19. Given the complexity and the fact that we cannot run code, we might use a simpler method: \n     - Use the last day (2017-06-25) as the base pattern and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 4 days? \n\n 20. We can compute the average of the last two days and then use the last day's pattern? \n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: the next day (2017-06-26) will be similar to the previous day (2017-06-25) but with a slight increase? \n\n 22. Since the problem does not specify the method, we are free to choose. Let's use the following:\n\n     We observe that the daily pattern is similar but the level shifts. We can take the average of the last two days (2017-06-24 and 2017-06-25) for each hour and then use that as the pattern for the next day? \n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we can project:\n\n        Day1 (2017-06-26): use the average of 2017-06-24 and 2017-06-25 for each hour.\n        Day2 (2017-06-27): same as Day1? or we can add a drift? \n\n     But note: the daily averages have been increasing: 20.39, 21.31 -> so the next day might be around 22.23? \n\n     We can compute the daily increase:\n\n        from 2017-06-24 to 2017-06-25: 21.31 - 20.39 = 0.92\n\n     Then we can assume a linear trend: so the next 4 days:\n\n        Day5 (2017-06-26): 21.31 + 0.92 = 22.23\n        Day6 (2017-06-27): 22.23 + 0.92 = 23.15\n        Day7 (2017-06-28): 23.15 + 0.92 = 24.07\n        Day8 (2017-06-29): 24.07 + 0.92 = 24.99\n\n     But this might be too aggressive? \n\n 23. Alternatively, we can use the average daily pattern and then shift the level by the projected daily average.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average of the last two days for each hour (so we have 24 points: each hour is the average of that hour on 2017-06-24 and 2017-06-25).\n\n        Step 2: Compute the current average of these 24 points: it should be (20.39+21.31)/2 = 20.85.\n\n        Step 3: For the next day (2017-06-26), we want the daily average to be 21.31 + 0.92 = 22.23. So we adjust the pattern by adding (22.23 - 20.85) = 1.38 to each hour of the pattern.\n\n        Step 4: For the next day (2017-06-27), we adjust the same pattern by adding (22.23 + 0.92 - 20.85) = 2.3? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Pattern for hour i: P_i = (D24_i + D25_i) / 2\n\n          Then for day 5 (2017-06-26): \n              OT_i = P_i + (22.23 - 20.85) = P_i + 1.38\n\n          For day 6 (2017-06-27): \n              OT_i = P_i + (23.15 - 20.85) = P_i + 2.3\n\n          For day 7 (2017-06-28): \n              OT_i = P_i + (24.07 - 20.85) = P_i + 3.22\n\n          For day 8 (2017-06-29): \n              OT_i = P_i + (24.99 - 20.85) = P_i + 4.14\n\n 24. But note: the daily average of the pattern is 20.85, so when we add 1.38 to every hour, the new daily average becomes 20.85+1.38=22.23, which is what we want.\n\n 25. However, we must be cautious: the pattern might change? But we are using the average of the last two days.\n\n 26. Let's compute the pattern P_i for each hour (0 to 23) from the last two days:\n\n     Hour 0: (19.063999 + 21.245001) / 2 = 40.309 / 2 = 20.1545\n     Hour 1: (18.783001 + 21.525999) / 2 = 40.309 / 2 = 20.1545? \n        Actually: \n          2017-06-24 00:00:00: 19.063999\n          2017-06-25 00:00:00: 21.245001 -> so (19.063999+21.245001)/2 = 20.1545\n\n        Hour 1: \n          2017-06-24 01:00:00: 18.783001\n          2017-06-25 01:00:00: 21.525999 -> (18.783001+21.525999)/2 = 20.1545\n\n        Wait, that's the same? That can't be. Let me check the data:\n\n        2017-06-24 00:00:00: 19.063999\n        2017-06-24 01:00:00: 18.783001\n        2017-06-25 00:00:00: 21.245001\n        2017-06-25 01:00:00: 21.525999\n\n        So Hour0: (19.063999+21.245001)/2 = 20.1545\n        Hour1: (18.783001+21.525999)/2 = 20.1545 -> actually 40.309/2=20.1545? \n        But 18.783001+21.525999 = 40.309 -> yes.\n\n        This is a coincidence? \n\n        Let me do Hour2:\n          2017-06-24 02:00:00: 18.500999\n          2017-06-25 02:00:00: 21.525999 -> (18.500999+21.525999)/2 = 40.026998/2 = 20.013499\n\n        So they are not all the same.\n\n 27.

Now, the average of P_i should be (sum of P_i)/24 = ?\n\n        Let me add:\n\n        20.1545 + 20.1545 + 20.0135 + 19.908 + 19.7325 + 20.1895 + 20.295 + 20.225 + 20.858 + 20.7875 + 20.893 + 20.7525 + 20.8225 + 21.034 + 21.4555 + 22.089 + 21.7725 + 21.737 + 21.737 + 21.6315 + 20.823 + 21.034 + 21.2095 + 21.0685\n\n        We can group:\n\n        First 8: 20.1545*2 = 40.309, 20.0135, 19.908, 19.7325, 20.1895, 20.295, 20.225 -> \n          40.309 + 20.0135 = 60.3225\n          +19.908 = 80.2305\n          +19.7325 = 99.963\n          +20.1895 = 120.1525\n          +20.295 = 140.4475\n          +20.225 = 160.6725\n\n        Next 8: 20.858, 20.7875, 20.893, 20.7525, 20.8225, 21.034, 21.4555, 22.089\n          160.6725 + 20.858 = 181.5305\n          +20.7875 = 202.318\n          +20.893 = 223.211\n          +20.7525 = 243.9635\n          +20.8225 = 264.786\n          +21.034 = 285.82\n          +21.4555 = 307.2755\n          +22.089 = 329.3645\n\n        Last 8: 21.7725, 21.737, 21.737, 21.6315, 20.823, 21.034, 21.2095, 21.0685\n          329.3645 + 21.7725 = 351.137\n          +21.737 = 372.874\n          +21.737 = 394.611\n          +21.6315 = 416.2425\n          +20.823 = 437.0655\n          +21.034 = 458.0995\n          +21.2095 = 479.309\n          +21.0685 = 500.3775\n\n        Average = 500.3775 / 24 = 20.8490625\n\n        Which is about 20.85 as we had.\n\n 29. Now, we project the next 4 days:\n\n        Day5 (2017-06-26): daily average = 21.31 + 0.92 = 22.23\n        So we add: 22.23 - 20.85 = 1.38 to each P_i.\n\n        Day6 (2017-06-27): daily average = 22.23 + 0.92 = 23.15 -> add 23.15 - 20.85 = 2.3\n        Day7 (2017-06-28): 23.15+0.92=24.07 -> add 24.07-20.85=3.22\n        Day8 (2017-06-29): 24.07+0.92=24.99 -> add 24.99-20.85=4.14\n\n 30. Then we can compute for each hour of each day.\n\n 31. But note: the timestamps must be generated: \n        Start from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 to 2017-06-29 23:00:00 (96 hours)\n\n 32. We'll generate:\n\n        For 2017-06-26 (day5): \n          00:00:00: P0 + 1.38 = 20.1545 + 1.38 = 21.5345\n          01:00:00: P1 + 1.38 = 20.1545 + 1.38 = 21.5345\n          02:00:00: P2 + 1.38 = 20.0135 + 1.38 = 21.3935\n          ... and so on.\n\n 33. However, note that the actual data might have noise and our method is simplistic. But given the constraints, we do this.\n\n 34. We must output 96 records.\n\n 35. Let's write the first day (2017-06-26) with the pattern adjusted by 1.38:\n\n        Hour0: 20.1545 + 1.38 = 21.5345\n        Hour1: 20.1545 + 1.38 = 21.5345\n        Hour2: 20.0135 + 1.38 = 21.3935\n        Hour3: 19.908 + 1.38 = 21.288\n        Hour4: 19.7325 + 1.38 = 21.1125\n        Hour5: 20.1895 + 1.38 = 21.5695\n        Hour6: 20.295 + 1.38 = 21.675\n        Hour7: 20.225 + 1.38 = 21.605\n        Hour8: 20.858 + 1.38 = 22.238\n        Hour9: 20.7875 + 1.38 = 22.1675\n        Hour10: 20.893 + 1.38 = 22.273\n        Hour11: 20.7525 + 1.38 = 22.1325\n        Hour12: 20.8225 + 1.38 = 22.2025\n        Hour13: 21.034 + 1.38 = 22.414\n        Hour14: 21.4555 + 1.38 = 22.8355\n        Hour15: 22.089 + 1.38 = 23.469\n        Hour16: 21.7725 + 1.38 = 23.1525\n        Hour17: 21.737 + 1.38 = 23.117\n        Hour18: 21.737 + 1.38 = 23.117\n        Hour19: 21.6315 + 1.38 = 23.0115\n        Hour20: 20.823 + 1.38 = 22.203\n        Hour21: 21.034 + 1.38 = 22.414\n        Hour22: 21.2095 + 1.38 = 22.5895\n        Hour23: 21.0685 + 1.38 = 22.4485\n\n 36. Then for 2017-06-27 (day6): add 2.3\n\n        Hour0: 20.1545 + 2.3 = 22.4545\n        ... and so on.\n\n 37. We do the same for the next two days.\n\n 38. However, note: the increasing trend of 0.92 per day might be too steep? We only have 4 days and the increase from day3 to day4 was 0.92, but from day2 to day3 was 1.6? \n\n        Day2: 18.79, Day3: 20.39 -> increase 1.6, then day4: 21.31 -> increase 0.92.\n\n     We might average the daily increases: ( (20.39-18.79) + (21.31-20.39) ) / 2 = (1.6 + 0.92)/2 = 1.26 per day? \n\n     Then:\n\n        Day5: 21.31 + 1.26 = 22.57\n        Day6: 22.57 + 1.26 = 23.83\n        Day7: 23.83 + 1.26 = 25.09\n        Day8: 25.09 + 1.26 = 26.35\n\n     Then the adjustments:\n\n        Day5: 22.57 - 20.85 = 1.72\n        Day6: 23.83 - 20.85 = 2.98\n        Day7: 25.09 - 20.85 = 4.24\n        Day8: 26.35 - 20.85 = 5.5\n\n 39. But note: the last two days (day3 and day4) had an average increase of (1.6+0.92)/2=1.26, but we only have two increases. \n\n 40. Given the time, we'll stick with the initial method (using the last increase of 0.92) for simplicity.\n\n 41. We'll generate the 96 records accordingly.\n\n 42. But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 records without missing.\n\n 43. We must output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n2017-06-26 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-06-26 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-06-29 23:00:00 <value>\n\n```\n\n 44. We'll do:\n\n        Day1: 2017-06-26, using P_i + 1.38\n        Day2: 2017-06-27, using P_i + 2.3\n        Day3: 2017-06-28, using P_i + 3.22\n        Day4: 2017-06-29, using P_i + 4.14\n\n 45. We have to be cautious: the timestamps are in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 46. Let's generate the first two days as an example and then the rest similarly.\n\n 47. We'll write the OT values with 6 decimal places? The input had 6. But note the input had up to 6 but sometimes less. We'll output 6 decimal places.\n\n 48. However, note that the input had 3 decimal places? Actually, the input had up to 6 decimal places? \n\n        Example: 17.938000 -> 6.\n\n        So we output 6.\n\n 49. We'll generate:\n\n        For 2017-06-26 00:00:00: 21.534500\n        For 2017-06-26 01:00:00: 21.534500\n        For 2017-06-26 02:00:00: 21.393500\n        ...\n\n 50. But note: we computed P0=20.1545, so 20.1545+1.38=21.5345 -> we write 21.534500\n\n 51. We do this for all 96.\n\n 52. However, the computation is tedious by hand. We have to do 24*4=96 lines.\n\n 53. We'll do it programmatically in our mind: for each hour in [0,23] for each day in [26,29] with the corresponding shift.\n\n 54.
