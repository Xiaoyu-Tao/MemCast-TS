        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive records without any missing time stamps? \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 records do not have any missing? \n    So we assume that the provided 96 records are complete, but we are to be cautious for the forecasting.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 future points.\n\n 3. We must choose a method. Given the data, we can use a time series model. Since we are at hourly level and there might be daily seasonality (24 hours),\n    we can use a model that captures seasonality. However, we only have 4 days of data (96 hours) which is very limited for training a complex model.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we are limited in the model we can use. We can try:\n    - Simple methods like Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) but 4 days might be too short to capture weekly patterns? \n      But we only have 4 days, so we can only capture daily seasonality (24 periods). However, 4 days is very short for training a seasonal model.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal model and rely on short-term autocorrelation.\n\n 5. Considering the data, we see that the temperature has a daily pattern: \n        - It rises during the day and falls at night? \n        But looking at the data, it's not very clear because we only have 4 days.\n\n    Let's check the pattern:\n\n        Day 1 (17th): \n            starts at 31.3, then goes up to 40.0 at 15:00, then down to 33.5 at night.\n        Day 2 (18th): \n            starts at 34.6, then goes up to 38.5 at 14:00, then down to 33.7 at night.\n        Day 3 (19th): \n            starts at 33.8, then has a dip at 11:00 (27.5) and 12:00 (29.3) which is unusual? then up to 34.0 at 18:00, then down.\n        Day 4 (20th): \n            starts at 32.0, then up to 36.8 at 19:00, then down to 35.7 at 23:00.\n\n    The dip on the 19th might be an anomaly? \n\n 6. Given the short history, we are to forecast 4 days, we can try to use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n    But the dip on the 19th might be an outlier and we don't have enough data to average.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model. We can try to fit an ARIMA model with daily seasonality (order 24) but that would require more data.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we might use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality? \n\n 9. However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more robust method. We can use the Prophet library? \n    But the problem does not specify the tools, and we are to output the data.\n\n 10. Since we are to provide the data and we cannot run code in the response, we have to use a method that we can describe and then generate the forecast.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n        - We can take the last day (24 hours) and use that as the forecast? \n        - Or we can take the average of the four days for each hour? \n\n    Let's try the average per hour:\n\n        We have 4 days, so for hour 00:00: \n            Day1: 31.304001\n            Day2: 34.611000\n            Day3: 33.766998\n            Day4: 32.007999\n            Average = (31.304001 + 34.611000 + 33.766998 + 32.007999) / 4 = 32.922\n\n        Similarly for hour 01:00: \n            Day1: 31.233999\n            Day2: 33.907001\n            Day3: 33.625999\n            Day4: 31.656000\n            Average = (31.233999 + 33.907001 + 33.625999 + 31.656000) / 4 = 32.60575\n\n        But note: the 19th has a dip at 11:00 and 12:00, which might pull down the average? \n\n 12. However, the problem says there might be missing values? But in the provided 96, we don't have missing? So we can use the average.\n\n 13. But the average might not capture the trend? We see that the temperatures on the first day and the last day are a bit lower? \n\n 14. Another idea: use the last day (20th) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 15. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to provide the data, we decide to use the average of the four days for each hour.\n\n 16. Steps for the forecast:\n\n        We will create a table for each hour of the day (00:00 to 23:00) and average the values for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n        Then we use that average pattern for the next 4 days (from 2016-07-21 to 2016-07-24).\n\n 17. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to see a trend. So we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n 18. However, the average method will produce the same pattern for each day? \n\n 19. We generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the computed average for each hour for 4 days.\n\n 20. But note: the average for each hour is computed from 4 days that are not exactly the same? \n\n 21. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 00:00: [31.304001, 34.611000, 33.766998, 32.007999] -> 32.922\n        Hour 01:00: [31.233999, 33.907001, 33.625999, 31.656000] -> 32.60575\n        Hour 02:00: [31.726000, 33.556000, 33.485001, 31.375000] -> 32.5355\n        Hour 03:00: [31.233999, 34.891998, 33.132999, 31.586000] -> 32.711\n        Hour 04:00: [31.867001, 34.962002, 32.922001, 32.430000] -> 33.045\n        Hour 05:00: [32.219002, 34.821999, 31.656000, 31.797001] -> 32.6235\n        Hour 06:00: [31.726000, 34.681000, 32.852001, 33.203999] -> 33.11575\n        Hour 07:00: [32.289001, 36.580002, 32.219002, 34.681000] -> 33.942\n        Hour 08:00: [34.258999, 34.400002, 31.726000, 34.400002] -> 33.696\n        Hour 09:00: [33.978001, 36.088001, 32.640999, 36.931999] -> 34.90975\n        Hour 10:00: [34.470001, 36.229000, 32.148998, 33.485001] -> 34.083\n        Hour 11:00: [35.243999, 36.299000, 27.506001, 33.625999] -> 33.1685\n        Hour 12:00: [36.299000, 35.946999, 29.264000, 33.203999] -> 33.67825\n        Hour 13:00: [36.721001, 37.354000, 31.445000, 33.273998] -> 34.6985\n        Hour 14:00: [38.339001, 38.549999, 31.514999, 35.525002] -> 35.982\n        Hour 15:00: [40.027000, 38.057999, 32.077999, 35.033001] -> 36.29875\n        Hour 16:00: [37.987000, 35.525002, 32.077999, 35.666000] -> 35.31375\n        Hour 17:00: [39.112999, 35.666000, 33.837002, 33.695999] -> 35.578\n        Hour 18:00: [37.002998, 33.132999, 34.048000, 34.400002] -> 34.64575\n        Hour 19:00: [35.243999, 33.625999, 33.695999, 36.791000] -> 34.839\n        Hour 20:00: [34.188999, 35.243999, 33.485001, 35.946999] -> 34.716\n        Hour 21:00: [33.837002, 33.556000, 32.710999, 35.384998] -> 33.87225\n        Hour 22:00: [33.485001, 33.907001, 32.640999, 34.328999] -> 33.5905\n        Hour 23:00: [33.485001, 33.695999, 32.430000, 35.736000] -> 33.83675\n\n 22. Then we create the next 4 days (2016-07-21 to 2016-07-24) by repeating the above 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 23. But note: the average for hour 11:00 and 12:00 are lower because of the dip on the 19th. This might be an outlier? \n     However, without more data, we have to include it.\n\n 24. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-21 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-07-20 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-07-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The original data has 3 decimal places? Actually, the original data has 6 decimal places? \n     But the numbers are given with 3 decimal places. However, the original data has up to 3 decimal places? \n        Example: 31.304001 -> we can keep 3 decimals? or 6? \n     The original data has 6 decimal places? But the problem does not specify. We'll keep 6 decimal places for consistency.\n\n 26. However, the average we computed is in more than 3 decimal places? We can round to 6 decimal places? \n\n 27. But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we are to output the numbers as we computed? \n\n 28. We'll output the numbers with 6 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 29. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-07-21 00:00:00 32.922000\n2016-07-21 01:00:00 32.605750\n2016-07-21 02:00:00 32.535500\n... \n        </answer>\n\n 30. However, note that the average method does not account for any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to see a trend.\n\n 31. We'll proceed with the average method.\n\n 32. But wait: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we don't have any in the provided 96? So we are safe.\n\n 33. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-07-21: hours 00:00 to 23:00 -> use the 24 averages we computed above.\n        Day2: 2016-07-22: same 24 averages\n        Day3: 2016-07-23: same\n        Day4: 2016-07-24: same\n\n 34. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 35. However, note: the average for hour 11:00 is 33.1685 -> we write 33.168500? \n\n 36. We'll write the numbers with 6 decimal places.\n\n 37. Let's do it.\n\n 38. But note: the average we computed might not be the best, but with limited data and without a complex model, it is a simple baseline.\n\n 39. We output the data from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n\n 40. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 41. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n",
