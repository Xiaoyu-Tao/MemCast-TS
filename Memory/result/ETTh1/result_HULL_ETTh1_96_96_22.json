        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete? Let's check: \n    - The data starts at 2016-09-27 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-09-30 23:00:00. That's 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points. So the given data is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We are not told the frequency, but the data is hourly. So we will generate 96 hours (4 days) ahead.\n\n 3. Since we are in a text-based environment and without the ability to run code, we must rely on a statistical method that can be described and applied manually? \n    However, the problem requires a forecast of 96 points. Given the complexity, we might use a simple time series method that can be implemented with basic calculations.\n\n 4. Considering the data pattern, we observe:\n    - The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours). \n    - We can try to use a seasonal naive method: each hour of the next day is the same as the same hour of the previous day? But note: we have 4 days of data.\n\n 5. However, the last day (2016-09-30) is the fourth day. We can use the average of the same hour over the available days?\n\n    Let's break the data into days:\n        Day1: 2016-09-27 (24 points)\n        Day2: 2016-09-28 (24 points)\n        Day3: 2016-09-29 (24 points)\n        Day4: 2016-09-30 (24 points)\n\n 6. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same pattern repeated? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-09-30) as the forecast for the next day? That is a naive seasonal method with seasonality=24.\n\n    However, the problem says the data will have missing values. But in the given 96 points we don't have missing? So we can use the given data.\n\n 7. Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide a complete forecast, we choose a method that is simple and robust.\n\n    We will use the Seasonal Naive method: \n        The forecast for the same hour of the next day is the value of that hour from the same day in the previous cycle (which is one day before). \n        But we have 4 days, so for the next day (2016-10-01) we can use the values from 2016-09-30? \n        Then for 2016-10-02, we can use the values from 2016-10-01? But we don't have that. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n    Let me define:\n        For hour h (0 to 23), the forecast for any day d in the future is:\n            y_{d,h} = average( y_{d1,h}, y_{d2,h}, y_{d3,h}, y_{d4,h} )\n        where d1, d2, d3, d4 are the four days we have.\n\n    But note: the data shows some variation and we don't see a clear trend? \n\n 8. However, looking at the data, the values on 2016-09-30 are generally higher than the previous days? \n    We might also consider using the last day (2016-09-30) as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n    But the problem says to forecast 96 points (4 days). We can use the same pattern of the last day for the next 4 days? \n\n    However, that would be repeating the same day 4 times. \n\n 9. Considering the requirement for simplicity and the fact that we don't have a trend, we can use the average by hour.\n\n    Steps for the average by hour:\n        For hour 00:00: average of [4.019 (27th), 5.827 (28th), 4.957 (29th), 4.421 (30th)] = (4.019+5.827+4.957+4.421)/4 = 19.224/4 = 4.806\n        Similarly for each hour.\n\n 10. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days (Tuesday to Friday). The next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? \n      We don't have data for Saturday and Sunday? So the average might not be the best.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (which is Friday) for Saturday? But we don't have a Saturday pattern. \n\n 12. Given the ambiguity, we will use the average of the four days for each hour to forecast the next four days. \n\n 13. How to handle the dates? \n      The last date is 2016-09-30 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n          2016-10-01 00:00:00, 2016-10-01 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-04 23:00:00.\n\n 14. We will compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 15. Let's do the calculation for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n     Hour 0 (00:00): \n        27: 4.019, 28: 5.827, 29: 4.957, 30: 4.421 -> avg = (4.019+5.827+4.957+4.421)/4 = 19.224/4 = 4.806\n\n     Hour 1 (01:00):\n        27: 2.947, 28: 5.559, 29: 4.019, 30: 4.622 -> (2.947+5.559+4.019+4.622)/4 = 17.147/4 = 4.28675\n\n     Hour 2 (02:00):\n        27: 3.550, 28: 6.028, 29: 4.019, 30: 4.086 -> (3.550+6.028+4.019+4.086)/4 = 17.683/4 = 4.42075\n\n     Hour 3 (03:00):\n        27: 3.550, 28: 4.086, 29: 4.957, 30: 3.818 -> (3.550+4.086+4.957+3.818)/4 = 16.411/4 = 4.10275\n\n     Hour 4 (04:00):\n        27: 5.760, 28: 5.693, 29: 4.689, 30: 4.086 -> (5.760+5.693+4.689+4.086)/4 = 20.228/4 = 5.057\n\n     Hour 5 (05:00):\n        27: 3.952, 28: 5.559, 29: 2.009, 30: 3.282 -> (3.952+5.559+2.009+3.282)/4 = 14.802/4 = 3.7005\n\n     Hour 6 (06:00):\n        27: 3.617, 28: 4.823, 29: 2.344, 30: 3.684 -> (3.617+4.823+2.344+3.684)/4 = 14.468/4 = 3.617\n\n     Hour 7 (07:00):\n        27: 3.751, 28: 5.358, 29: 2.880, 30: 3.617 -> (3.751+5.358+2.880+3.617)/4 = 15.606/4 = 3.9015\n\n     Hour 8 (08:00):\n        27: 4.086, 28: 4.756, 29: 2.344, 30: 3.617 -> (4.086+4.756+2.344+3.617)/4 = 14.803/4 = 3.70075\n\n     Hour 9 (09:00):\n        27: 2.746, 28: 4.756, 29: 1.608, 30: 4.689 -> (2.746+4.756+1.608+4.689)/4 = 13.799/4 = 3.44975\n\n     Hour 10 (10:00):\n        27: 3.952, 28: 4.555, 29: 2.277, 30: 4.756 -> (3.952+4.555+2.277+4.756)/4 = 15.54/4 = 3.885\n\n     Hour 11 (11:00):\n        27: 3.483, 28: 4.488, 29: 2.277, 30: 4.689 -> (3.483+4.488+2.277+4.689)/4 = 14.937/4 = 3.73425\n\n     Hour 12 (12:00):\n        27: 3.349, 28: 2.679, 29: 1.942, 30: 3.818 -> (3.349+2.679+1.942+3.818)/4 = 11.788/4 = 2.947\n\n     Hour 13 (13:00):\n        27: 3.617, 28: 2.947, 29: 2.679, 30: 4.890 -> (3.617+2.947+2.679+4.890)/4 = 14.133/4 = 3.53325\n\n     Hour 14 (14:00):\n        27: 3.751, 28: 3.550, 29: 2.545, 30: 5.023 -> (3.751+3.550+2.545+5.023)/4 = 14.869/4 = 3.71725\n\n     Hour 15 (15:00):\n        27: 4.220, 28: 3.751, 29: 2.143, 30: 4.756 -> (4.220+3.751+2.143+4.756)/4 = 14.87/4 = 3.7175\n\n     Hour 16 (16:00):\n        27: 4.421, 28: 3.014, 29: 2.143, 30: 3.818 -> (4.421+3.014+2.143+3.818)/4 = 13.396/4 = 3.349\n\n     Hour 17 (17:00):\n        27: 3.550, 28: 2.880, 29: 1.808, 30: 3.751 -> (3.550+2.880+1.808+3.751)/4 = 11.989/4 = 2.99725\n\n     Hour 18 (18:00):\n        27: 3.148, 28: 1.206, 29: 2.411, 30: 3.148 -> (3.148+1.206+2.411+3.148)/4 = 9.913/4 = 2.47825\n\n     Hour 19 (19:00):\n        27: 3.148, 28: 1.273, 29: 2.143, 30: 3.014 -> (3.148+1.273+2.143+3.014)/4 = 9.578/4 = 2.3945\n\n     Hour 20 (20:00):\n        27: 3.215, 28: 1.407, 29: 2.076, 30: 2.478 -> (3.215+1.407+2.076+2.478)/4 = 9.176/4 = 2.294\n\n     Hour 21 (21:00):\n        27: 3.416, 28: 2.076, 29: 1.674, 30: 2.277 -> (3.416+2.076+1.674+2.277)/4 = 9.443/4 = 2.36075\n\n     Hour 22 (22:00):\n        27: 4.153, 28: 2.076, 29: 2.947, 30: 2.746 -> (4.153+2.076+2.947+2.746)/4 = 11.922/4 = 2.9805\n\n     Hour 23 (23:00):\n        27: 3.148, 28: 3.952, 29: 3.349, 30: 3.215 -> (3.148+3.952+3.349+3.215)/4 = 13.664/4 = 3.416\n\n 16. Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-10-01 to 2016-10-04) will be the same set of 24 averages repeated for each day.\n\n 17. Therefore, the forecast for:\n        Day1: 2016-10-01: [4.806, 4.28675, 4.42075, 4.10275, 5.057, 3.7005, 3.617, 3.9015, 3.70075, 3.44975, 3.885, 3.73425, 2.947, 3.53325, 3.71725, 3.7175, 3.349, 2.99725, 2.47825, 2.3945, 2.294, 2.36075, 2.9805, 3.416]\n        Day2: 2016-10-02: same as above\n        Day3: 2016-10-03: same as above\n        Day4: 2016-10-04: same as above\n\n 18. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the training, but we are to be aware. We have handled the training data as complete.\n\n 19. We output the next 96 points with the above values.\n\n 20. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, with the date and the HULL value.\n\n 21. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-01 00:00:00\n      Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-10-04 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 23. We note that the averages we computed to 5 decimal places? But the input data has 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places? \n      However, the input has 3 decimal places, so we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 24. Let's round the averages:\n\n        Hour0: 4.806 -> 4.806 (already 3 decimals)\n        Hour1: 4.28675 -> 4.287\n        Hour2: 4.42075 -> 4.421\n        Hour3: 4.10275 -> 4.103\n        Hour4: 5.057 -> 5.057\n        Hour5: 3.7005 -> 3.701\n        Hour6: 3.617 -> 3.617\n        Hour7: 3.9015 -> 3.902\n        Hour8: 3.70075 -> 3.701\n        Hour9: 3.44975 -> 3.450\n        Hour10: 3.885 -> 3.885\n        Hour11: 3.73425 -> 3.734\n        Hour12: 2.947 -> 2.947\n        Hour13: 3.53325 -> 3.533\n        Hour14: 3.71725 -> 3.717\n        Hour15: 3.7175 -> 3.718\n        Hour16: 3.349 -> 3.349\n        Hour17: 2.99725 -> 2.997\n        Hour18: 2.47825 -> 2.478\n        Hour19: 2.3945 -> 2.395\n        Hour20: 2.294 -> 2.294\n        Hour21: 2.36075 -> 2.361\n        Hour22: 2.9805 -> 2.981\n        Hour23: 3.416 -> 3.416\n\n 25. Now we write the data:\n\n     2016-10-01 00:00:00 4.806\n     2016-10-01 01:00:00 4.287\n     ... and so on for 24 hours for 4 days.\n\n 26. We note: the dates are in the format.\n\n 27. We output in the required format.\n\n 28. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but we are not given any in the training. We are forecasting without gaps? \n      We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points. So we output all 96.\n\n 29. We write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-01 00:00:00 4.806\n2016-10-01 01:00:00 4.287\n2016-10-01 02:00:00 4.421\n2016-10-01 03:00:00 4.103\n2016-10-01 04:00:00 5.057\n2016-10-01 05:00:00 3.701\n2016-10-01 06:00:00 3.617\n2016-10-01 07:00:00 3.902\n2016-10-01 08:00:00 3.701\n2016-10-01 09:00:00 3.450\n2016-10-01 10:00:00 3.885\n2016-10-01 11:00:00 3.734\n2016-10-01 12:00:00 2.947\n2016-10-01 13:00:00 3.533\n2016-10-01 14:00:00 3.717\n2016-10-01 15:00:00 3.718\n2016-10-01 16:00:00 3.349\n2016-10-01 17:00:00 2.997\n2016-10-01 18:00:00 2.478\n2016-10-01 19:00:00 2.395\n2016-10-01 20:00:00 2.294\n2016-10-01 21:00:00 2.361\n2016-10-01 22:00:00 2.981\n2016-10-01 23:00:00 3.416\n2016-10-02 00:00:00 4.806\n2016-10-02 01:00:00 4.287\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 30.
