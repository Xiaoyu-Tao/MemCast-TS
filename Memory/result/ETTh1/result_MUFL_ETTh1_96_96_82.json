        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-29 00:00:00 to 2017-06-02 00:00:00? Let's check: 96 hours from 2017-05-29 00:00:00 would be 4 days, so until 2017-06-01 23:00:00? Actually, 96 hours is exactly 4 days, so from 2017-05-29 00:00:00 to 2017-06-01 23:00:00).\n\n However, note: the last provided date is 2017-05-28 23:00:00. The next 96 steps would be:\n  2017-05-29 00:00:00, 2017-05-29 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-01 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values in general. However, for forecasting, we'll assume we are to forecast the next 96 points without gaps.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the pattern (which seems to have daily seasonality), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Since we are to provide 96 points, we must generate 96 consecutive forecasts.\n\n 4. We note the data has a clear daily pattern (24 hours). The pattern: \n    - During the night (e.g., 00:00 to 05:00) the values are positive and relatively high (around 3 to 6).\n    - Then in the morning (around 07:00 to 16:00) the values drop, even becoming negative (as low as -15).\n    - Then in the evening (17:00 to 23:00) they rise again.\n\n 5. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). We can use a seasonal model. Given the complexity and the need for automation, we might use a simple seasonal decomposition or a model like SARIMA.\n\n However, note: we are not allowed to use external libraries? We are to generate the data. Since we are an expert, we can simulate a forecast by capturing the pattern.\n\n Approach:\n  - We can compute the average daily pattern from the 4 days we have (25th to 28th of May 2017) and then use that to forecast the next 4 days (29th to 1st of June).\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n  25th: \n    Min: -13.539, Max: 5.579\n  26th: \n    Min: -15.778, Max: 5.792\n  27th: \n    Min: -14.854, Max: 5.401\n  28th: \n    Min: -14.143, Max: 7.427\n\n The maximum seems to be increasing? But the minimum is also fluctuating. We don't have a clear long-term trend in 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (28th) as a base and adjust with the average daily pattern? But we have 4 days, so we can average each hour.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n\n  We have 4 days of data, each day has 24 hours. We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n  However, note: the data starts at 2017-05-25 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-05-28 23:00:00, which is exactly 4 days (96 hours).\n\n  We can reshape the data into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean for each hour (column-wise). Then we use that 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days? But that would be exactly the same pattern for each day. However, we see that the pattern is similar but not identical.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a moving average to smooth the pattern and then project.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data has missing values? In the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n  However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning in general, but the provided data for the past 96 is complete. So we can use it.\n\n  Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n    hour0: (3.802 + 4.442 + 4.762 + 5.401) / 4 = (3.802+4.442+4.762+5.401)/4 = 18.407/4 = 4.60175\n    hour1: (3.660+4.406+5.295+4.477)/4 = (3.660+4.406+5.295+4.477)=17.838/4=4.4595\n    ... and so on.\n\n  Then we can use this 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days? But we have 4 days to forecast, so we repeat the pattern 4 times.\n\n  However, we must consider if there is a trend? The data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. The maximum on the 28th is higher, but the minimums are similar. We might assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n  But note: the problem does not specify the time of year, and we are going from May to June? The load might change? But we don't have long-term data. So we stick to the average.\n\n  However, we can also consider using the last day (28th) and then adjust by the average daily pattern? That might be better? Or we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n  Let's do: for each hour in the day, we take the average of the 4 days we have. Then we use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Step 1: Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n    Step 2: For the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign:\n        Day1 (29th): the 24-hour pattern (from hour0 to hour23) as the average we computed.\n        Day2 (30th): same pattern\n        Day3 (31st): same pattern\n        Day4 (1st): same pattern\n\n  But note: the 28th was a Sunday? and 25th was a Thursday? We don't have information about weekly seasonality? And we only have 4 days. So we cannot capture weekly pattern. Therefore, we assume the daily pattern is the same for the next day.\n\n  However, looking at the data:\n\n    Thursday (25th), Friday (26th), Saturday (27th), Sunday (28th) and then we are forecasting Monday (29th), Tuesday (30th), Wednesday (31st), Thursday (1st).\n\n  We don't have data for Monday to Wednesday? So we cannot adjust for weekly pattern. Therefore, we use the average of the last 4 days.\n\n  But note: the provided data does not have a clear weekly pattern because we only have 4 consecutive days? And the pattern seems consistent? So we use the average.\n\n  Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the data for the same hour on different days:\n\n    Example: hour 7 (07:00):\n        25th: 0.036\n        26th: 1.599\n        27th: 1.350\n        28th: 3.198\n        Average = (0.036+1.599+1.350+3.198)/4 = 6.183/4 = 1.54575\n\n    hour 8 (08:00):\n        25th: -4.406\n        26th: -3.518\n        27th: -3.482\n        28th: -1.990\n        Average = (-4.406 -3.518 -3.482 -1.990)/4 = -13.396/4 = -3.349\n\n    This seems reasonable.\n\n  Step 3: Generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"the data will have missing values\", but we are generating the forecast without missing values? The forecast should be complete.\n\n  We are to output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n  Format:\n\n        date    MUFL\n        2017-05-29 00:00:00   [value]\n        2017-05-29 01:00:00   [value]\n        ... \n        2017-06-01 23:00:00   [value]\n\n  We must generate the timestamps: starting at 2017-05-29 00:00:00 and then every hour until 96 steps.\n\n  How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n  Let's do it step by step:\n\n    hour0: (3.802, 4.442, 4.762, 5.401) -> average = (3.802+4.442+4.762+5.401)/4 = 18.407/4 = 4.60175\n    hour1: (3.660, 4.406, 5.295, 4.477) -> (3.660+4.406+5.295+4.477)=17.838/4=4.4595\n    hour2: (3.376, 2.452, 4.015, 4.406) -> (3.376+2.452+4.015+4.406)=14.249/4=3.56225\n    hour3: (3.127, 3.696, 4.904, 4.513) -> (3.127+3.696+4.904+4.513)=16.24/4=4.06\n    hour4: (2.843, 4.548, 5.117, 4.904) -> (2.843+4.548+5.117+4.904)=17.412/4=4.353\n    hour5: (4.335, 5.792, 5.224, 6.538) -> (4.335+5.792+5.224+6.538)=21.889/4=5.47225\n    hour6: (5.579, 5.472, 5.330, 7.356) -> (5.579+5.472+5.330+7.356)=23.737/4=5.93425\n    hour7: (0.036, 1.599, 1.350, 3.198) -> (0.036+1.599+1.350+3.198)=6.183/4=1.54575\n    hour8: (-4.406, -3.518, -3.482, -1.990) -> (-4.406-3.518-3.482-1.990)=-13.396/4=-3.349\n    hour9: (-9.026, -9.275, -7.107, -7.071) -> (-9.026-9.275-7.107-7.071)=-32.479/4=-8.11975\n    hour10: (-10.270, -12.153, -10.803, -10.127) -> (-10.270-12.153-10.803-10.127)=-43.353/4=-10.83825\n    hour11: (-6.396, -13.859, -12.473, -11.549) -> (-6.396-13.859-12.473-11.549)=-44.277/4=-11.06925\n    hour12: (-9.630, -15.778, -14.854, -14.143) -> (-9.630-15.778-14.854-14.143)=-54.405/4=-13.60125\n    hour13: (-13.539, -14.818, -14.498, -12.544) -> (-13.539-14.818-14.498-12.544)=-55.399/4=-13.84975\n    hour14: (-4.335, -13.432, -12.935, -11.620) -> (-4.335-13.432-12.935-11.620)=-42.322/4=-10.5805\n    hour15: (-3.447, -10.127, -9.985, -8.990) -> (-3.447-10.127-9.985-8.990)=-32.549/4=-8.13725\n    hour16: (-7.427, -5.010, -5.615, -4.015) -> (-7.427-5.010-5.615-4.015)=-22.067/4=-5.51675\n    hour17: (2.416, 0.746, 1.421, -0.497) -> (2.416+0.746+1.421-0.497)=4.086/4=1.0215\n    hour18: (1.599, 2.452, 3.838, 3.376) -> (1.599+2.452+3.838+3.376)=11.265/4=2.81625\n    hour19: (3.411, 3.660, 4.300, 4.406) -> (3.411+3.660+4.300+4.406)=15.777/4=3.94425\n    hour20: (3.944, 4.087, 4.513, 5.330) -> (3.944+4.087+4.513+5.330)=17.874/4=4.4685\n    hour21: (3.553, 3.660, 4.229, 4.620) -> (3.553+3.660+4.229+4.620)=16.062/4=4.0155\n    hour22: (5.046, 3.909, 4.939, 5.828) -> (5.046+3.909+4.939+5.828)=19.722/4=4.9305\n    hour23: (4.371, 4.975, 4.229, 7.427) -> (4.371+4.975+4.229+7.427)=21.002/4=5.2505\n\n  Then the pattern for one day is:\n\n    [0: 4.60175, 1: 4.4595, 2: 3.56225, 3: 4.06, 4: 4.353, 5: 5.47225, 6: 5.93425, 7: 1.54575, 8: -3.349, 9: -8.11975, 10: -10.83825, 11: -11.06925, 12: -13.60125, 13: -13.84975, 14: -10.5805, 15: -8.13725, 16: -5.51675, 17: 1.0215, 18: 2.81625, 19: 3.94425, 20: 4.4685, 21: 4.0155, 22: 4.9305, 23: 5.2505]\n\n  Now, we repeat this pattern 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n  The dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-05-29 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-05-28 23:00:00)\n\n    Then:\n        2017-05-29 00:00:00 -> hour0: 4.60175\n        2017-05-29 01:00:00 -> hour1: 4.4595\n        ...\n        2017-05-29 23:00:00 -> hour23: 5.2505\n\n        2017-05-30 00:00:00 -> hour0: 4.60175\n        ... and so on until 4 days.\n\n  We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n  We output the data in the same format as the input, with the date and the MUFL value.\n\n  We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  However, note: the input has negative values and up to 3 decimal places.\n\n  Let's create the list:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-05-29\n        hour0: 4.602 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        hour1: 4.460\n        hour2: 3.562\n        hour3: 4.060\n        hour4: 4.353\n        hour5: 5.472\n        hour6: 5.934\n        hour7: 1.546\n        hour8: -3.349\n        hour9: -8.120\n        hour10: -10.838\n        hour11: -11.069\n        hour12: -13.601\n        hour13: -13.850\n        hour14: -10.580\n        hour15: -8.137\n        hour16: -5.517\n        hour17: 1.022\n        hour18: 2.816\n        hour19: 3.944\n        hour20: 4.468\n        hour21: 4.016\n        hour22: 4.930\n        hour23: 5.251\n\n    Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n  But note: the last day of the forecast is 2017-06-01 23:00:00.\n\n  How to generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-05-29 00:00:00\n    Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n  We'll generate:\n\n    from datetime import datetime, timedelta  [But note: we are not coding, we are generating the data]\n\n  We can do:\n\n    base = datetime(2017, 5, 29, 0, 0, 0)\n    then for i in range(96):\n        date = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n  But we are to output the data as string in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n  However, we are not running code? We are to write the data.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n    2017-05-29 00:00:00   4.602\n    2017-05-29 01:00:00   4.460\n    ... \n\n  We have 96 lines.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n  We'll write all 96 lines.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the rounding might cause slight changes. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n  Let's do the rounding for each value:\n\n    We have the averages computed above, we round to 3 decimals.\n\n  Example: 4.60175 -> 4.602 (because 7>=5, so round up the 1 to 2? Actually: 4.60175: \n  The fourth decimal is 7, so we round the third decimal (1) up by 1 -> becomes 2? So 4.602.\n\n  Similarly, 4.4595: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the 9? But 9 becomes 10 -> so 4.460.\n\n  We'll round each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n  We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n  Let's create the list of 96 values:\n\n    We have 4 repetitions of the 24-hour pattern.\n\n  We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n  Note: the problem says to output in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date string]   [value]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n  We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-29 00:00:00   4.602\n2017-05-29 01:00:00   4.460\n2017-05-29 02:00:00   3.562\n2017-05-29 03:00:00   4.060\n2017-05-29 04:00:00   4.353\n2017-05-29 05:00:00   5.472\n2017-05-29 06:00:00   5.934\n2017-05-29 07:00:00   1.546\n2017-05-29 08:00:00  -3.349\n2017-05-29 09:00:00  -8.120\n2017-05-29 10:00:00 -10.838\n2017-05-29 11:00:00 -11.069\n2017-05-29 12:00:00 -13.601\n2017-05-29 13:00:00 -13.850\n2017-05-29 14:00:00 -10.580\n2017-05-29 15:00:00  -8.137\n2017-05-29 16:00:00  -5.517\n2017-05-29 17:00:00   1.022\n2017-05-29 18:00:00   2.816\n2017-05-29 19:00:00   3.944\n2017-05-29 20:00:00   4.468\n2017-05-29 21:00:00   4.016\n2017-05-29 22:00:00   4.930\n2017-05-29 23:00:00   5.251\n2017-05-30 00:00:00   4.602\n2017-05-30 01:00:00   4.460\n2017-05-30 02:00:00   3.562\n2017-05-30 03:00:00   4.060\n2017-05-30 04:00:00   4.353\n2017-05-30 05:00:00   5.472\n2017-05-30 06:00:00   5.934\n2017-05-30 07:00:00   1.546\n2017-05-30 08:00:00  -3.349\n2017-05-30 09:00:00  -8.120\n2017-05-30 10:00:00 -10.838\n2017-05-30 11:00:00 -11.069\n2017-05-30 12:00:00 -13.601\n2017-05-30 13:00:00 -13.850\n2017-05-30 14:00:00 -10.580\n2017-05-30 15:00:00  -8.137\n2017-05-30 16:00:00  -5.517\n2017-05-30 17:00:00   1.022\n2017-05-30 18:00:00   2.816\n2017-05-30 19:00:00   3.944\n2017-05-30 20:00:00   4.468\n2017-05-30 21:00:00   4.016\n2017-05-30 22:00:00   4.930\n2017-05-30 23:00:00   5.251\n2017-05-31 00:00:00   4.602\n2017-05-31 01:00:00   4.460\n2017-05-31 02:00:00   3.562\n2017-05-31 03:00:00   4.060\n2017-05-31 04:00:00   4.353\n2017-05-31 05:00:00   5.472\n2017-05-31 06:00:00   5.934\n2017-05-31 07:00:00   1.546\n2017-05-31 08:00:00  -3.349\n2017-05-31 09:00:00  -8.120\n2017-05-31 10:00:00 -10.838\n2017-05-31 11:00:00 -11.069\n2017-05-31 12:00:00 -13.601\n2017-05-31 13:00:00 -13.850\n2017-05-31 14:00:00 -10.580\n2017-05-31 15:00:00  -8.137\n2017-05-31 16:00:00  -5.517\n2017-05-31 17:00:00   1.022\n2017-05-31 18:00:00   2.816\n2017-05-31 19:00:00   3.944\n2017-05-31 20:00:00   4.468\n2017-05-31 21:00:00   4.016\n2017-05-31 22:00:00   4.930\n2017-05-31 23:00:00   5.251\n2017-06-01 00:00:00   4.602\n2017-06-01 01:00:00   4.460\n2017-06-01 02:00:00   3.562\n2017-06-01 03:00:00   4.060\n2017-06-01 04:00:00   4.353\n2017-06-01 05:00:00   5.472\n2017-06-01 06:00:00   5.934\n2017-06-01 07:00:00   1.546\n2017-06-01 08:00:00  -3.349\n2017-06-01 09:00:00  -8.120\n2017-06-01 10:00:00 -10.838\n2017-06-01 11:00:00 -11.069\n2017-06-01 12:00:00 -13.601\n2017-06-01 13:00:00 -13.850\n2017-06-01 14:00:00 -10.580\n2017-06-01 15:00:00  -8.137\n2017-06-01 16:00:00  -5.517\n2017-06-01 17:00:00   1.022\n2017-06-01 18:00:00   2.816\n2017-06-01 19:00:00   3.944\n2017-06-01 20:00:00   4.468\n2017-06-01 21:00:00   4.016\n2017-06-01 22:00:00   4.930\n2017-06-01 23:00:00   5.251\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n  But note: the date for the last day is 2017-06-01? Because 2017-05-29 + 3 days is 2017-06-01? Actually:\n\n    May has 31 days, so:\n        29, 30, 31 of May and then 1st of June? That's 4 days? \n        Day0: 29 -> 24 hours\n        Day1: 30 -> 24 hours\n        Day2: 31 -> 24 hours\n        Day3: 1 -> 24 hours\n\n  So the last date is 2017-06-01 23:00:00.\n\n  We have 4 days: 29,30,31 of May) and 1 of June.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  We output the data accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the problem says to be aware of missing values, but we are not given any in the input and we are generating a complete forecast.
