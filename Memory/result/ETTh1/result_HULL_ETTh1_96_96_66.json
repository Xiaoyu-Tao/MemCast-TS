        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any missing values in the training data, but here we don't have any in the given training period.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting 4 days ahead.\n\n 3. We must choose a model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon for such a short history), \n    we can use a model that can capture seasonality and trends. The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal model. Let's try to decompose the series to see if there is a pattern.\n\n 5. However, note that the data is about electricity transformers, and the load might have daily patterns.\n\n 6. We can use a simple seasonal naive approach, but that would just repeat the last day. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonality.\n\n 7. Given the small data, we can use an automated method. We are in a constrained environment without the ability to run code, so we have to reason.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the past days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 9. Since the problem says there might be missing values in the data, but in the provided training set there are none, we can proceed.\n\n 10. We will use an automated forecasting model. In practice, we would use `statsmodels` or `prophet` or `auto_arima`. But since we cannot run code, we have to simulate.\n\n 11. However, the problem requires a complete set of 96 forecasted values. We must generate them.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n     - We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n     - But note: the data from 2017-03-22 to 2017-03-25 (4 days) might not be exactly the same pattern. Also, the last day (2017-03-25) might be a Saturday? \n       and the next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? We don't have information about the day of the week.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-25) as the pattern for the next day? But that might not account for weekly seasonality.\n\n 14. Since we have only 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 15. Steps for averaging:\n     - Group by hour of the day (so 24 groups) and take the mean of the HULL values for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n 16. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours), we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 17. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n     Day 1 (2017-03-22): mean = (sum of 24 values)/24\n     Day 2: mean, Day 3: mean, Day 4: mean.\n\n     We can compute:\n\n        Day1: from 2017-03-22: \n          values: 0.268, 1.474, ... , 0.134 -> mean = ?\n\n        We don't have to compute by hand, but we can note that the data seems to fluctuate without a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n 18. Therefore, we will use the hourly average over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 19. How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.268 + 1.206 + 2.411 + 1.674) / 4 = (0.268+1.206=1.474; 1.474+2.411=3.885; 3.885+1.674=5.559) -> 5.559/4 = 1.38975\n     Hour 1: (1.474 + 2.009 + 1.808 + 1.875) / 4 = (1.474+2.009=3.483; 3.483+1.808=5.291; 5.291+1.875=7.166) -> 7.166/4 = 1.7915\n\n     ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n 20. Then we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times for the next 96 hours.\n\n 21. We must generate the dates: starting from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n 22. Format: the date string as in the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 23. We must provide the complete data, so we will output 96 lines.\n\n 24. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we are generating without missing.\n\n 25. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n     Hour 0: [0.268, 1.206, 2.411, 1.674] -> average = (0.268+1.206+2.411+1.674)/4 = 5.559/4 = 1.38975\n     Hour 1: [1.474, 2.009, 1.808, 1.875] -> (1.474+2.009+1.808+1.875) = 7.166/4 = 1.7915\n     Hour 2: [0.938, 1.474, 2.813, 1.474] -> (0.938+1.474+2.412; 2.412+2.813=5.225; 5.225+1.474=6.699) -> 6.699/4 = 1.67475\n     Hour 3: [0.000, 1.608, 2.478, 1.674] -> (0+1.608=1.608; 1.608+2.478=4.086; 4.086+1.674=5.76) -> 5.76/4 = 1.44\n     Hour 4: [0.536, 1.474, 2.210, 2.076] -> (0.536+1.474=2.01; 2.01+2.210=4.22; 4.22+2.076=6.296) -> 6.296/4 = 1.574\n     Hour 5: [0.737, 0.268, 2.746, 1.541] -> (0.737+0.268=1.005; 1.005+2.746=3.751; 3.751+1.541=5.292) -> 5.292/4 = 1.323\n     Hour 6: [0.335, 0.000, 1.340, 1.340] -> (0.335+0=0.335; 0.335+1.340=1.675; 1.675+1.340=3.015) -> 3.015/4 = 0.75375\n     Hour 7: [0.737, 1.608, 1.674, 0.804] -> (0.737+1.608=2.345; 2.345+1.674=4.019; 4.019+0.804=4.823) -> 4.823/4 = 1.20575\n     Hour 8: [0.938, 0.603, 1.674, 1.206] -> (0.938+0.603=1.541; 1.541+1.674=3.215; 3.215+1.206=4.421) -> 4.421/4 = 1.10525\n     Hour 9: [-0.067, 0.603, 0.000, 0.670] -> (-0.067+0.603=0.536; 0.536+0=0.536; 0.536+0.670=1.206) -> 1.206/4 = 0.3015\n     Hour 10: [0.134, 0.335, 0.000, 2.076] -> (0.134+0.335=0.469; 0.469+0=0.469; 0.469+2.076=2.545) -> 2.545/4 = 0.63625\n     Hour 11: [0.335, -0.737, 0.067, 2.210] -> (0.335-0.737=-0.402; -0.402+0.067=-0.335; -0.335+2.210=1.875) -> 1.875/4 = 0.46875\n     Hour 12: [-0.737, -0.737, 0.000, 0.000] -> (-0.737-0.737=-1.474; -1.474+0=-1.474; -1.474+0=-1.474) -> -1.474/4 = -0.3685\n     Hour 13: [0.000, -0.603, 0.201, 1.942] -> (0-0.603=-0.603; -0.603+0.201=-0.402; -0.402+1.942=1.54) -> 1.54/4 = 0.385\n     Hour 14: [-0.134, -0.603, 0.871, 1.741] -> (-0.134-0.603=-0.737; -0.737+0.871=0.134; 0.134+1.741=1.875) -> 1.875/4 = 0.46875\n     Hour 15: [0.268, -0.737, 0.603, 1.139] -> (0.268-0.737=-0.469; -0.469+0.603=0.134; 0.134+1.139=1.273) -> 1.273/4 = 0.31825\n     Hour 16: [-0.201, -0.603, 0.335, -0.067] -> (-0.201-0.603=-0.804; -0.804+0.335=-0.469; -0.469-0.067=-0.536) -> -0.536/4 = -0.134\n     Hour 17: [-0.335, 0.000, 0.000, -0.469] -> (-0.335+0=-0.335; -0.335+0=-0.335; -0.335-0.469=-0.804) -> -0.804/4 = -0.201\n     Hour 18: [-2.076, -0.201, -0.335, -0.603] -> (-2.076-0.201=-2.277; -2.277-0.335=-2.612; -2.612-0.603=-3.215) -> -3.215/4 = -0.80375\n     Hour 19: [-2.411, -0.134, -0.201, -0.804] -> (-2.411-0.134=-2.545; -2.545-0.201=-2.746; -2.746-0.804=-3.55) -> -3.55/4 = -0.8875\n     Hour 20: [-2.210, -0.134, -0.469, -0.536] -> (-2.210-0.134=-2.344; -2.344-0.469=-2.813; -2.813-0.536=-3.349) -> -3.349/4 = -0.83725\n     Hour 21: [-3.416, -0.402, -1.139, 0.000] -> (-3.416-0.402=-3.818; -3.818-1.139=-4.957; -4.957+0=-4.957) -> -4.957/4 = -1.23925\n     Hour 22: [-1.206, 0.603, 0.067, -0.402] -> (-1.206+0.603=-0.603; -0.603+0.067=-0.536; -0.536-0.402=-0.938) -> -0.938/4 = -0.2345\n     Hour 23: [0.134, 1.005, 0.268, 0.402] -> (0.134+1.005=1.139; 1.139+0.268=1.407; 1.407+0.402=1.809) -> 1.809/4 = 0.45225\n\n 26. Now, we create the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-03-26 to 2017-03-29) by repeating the above 24 averages in order for each day.\n\n 27. The dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-03-26 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-03-26 01:00:00 ... up to 2017-03-26 23:00:00 -> first day\n     Then 2017-03-27 00:00:00 ... -> second day, and so on until 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'. The HULL values are the averages we computed, rounded to 3 decimal places? \n     The input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Let's list the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimal places):\n\n     Hour0: 1.390\n     Hour1: 1.792\n     Hour2: 1.675\n     Hour3: 1.440\n     Hour4: 1.574\n     Hour5: 1.323\n     Hour6: 0.754\n     Hour7: 1.206\n     Hour8: 1.105\n     Hour9: 0.302\n     Hour10: 0.636\n     Hour11: 0.469\n     Hour12: -0.369\n     Hour13: 0.385\n     Hour14: 0.469\n     Hour15: 0.318\n     Hour16: -0.134\n     Hour17: -0.201\n     Hour18: -0.804\n     Hour19: -0.888\n     Hour20: -0.837\n     Hour21: -1.239\n     Hour22: -0.235\n     Hour23: 0.452\n\n 30. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day1: 2017-03-26: \n        00:00:00 -> 1.390\n        01:00:00 -> 1.792\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.452\n\n     Day2: 2017-03-27: same 24 numbers again.\n\n     Day3: 2017-03-28: same.\n\n     Day4: 2017-03-29: same.\n\n 31. We must generate the date strings:\n\n     We start at 2017-03-26 00:00:00 and then increment by 1 hour until 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n 32. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-26 00:00:00  1.390\n2017-03-26 01:00:00  1.792\n... (96 lines)\n2017-03-29 23:00:00  0.452\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 33. Let's write the first day:\n\n     2017-03-26 00:00:00  1.390\n     2017-03-26 01:00:00  1.792\n     2017-03-26 02:00:00  1.675\n     2017-03-26 03:00:00  1.440\n     2017-03-26 04:00:00  1.574\n     2017-03-26 05:00:00  1.323\n     2017-03-26 06:00:00  0.754\n     2017-03-26 07:00:00  1.206\n     2017-03-26 08:00:00  1.105\n     2017-03-26 09:00:00  0.302\n     2017-03-26 10:00:00  0.636\n     2017-03-26 11:00:00  0.469\n     2017-03-26 12:00:00 -0.369\n     2017-03-26 13:00:00  0.385\n     2017-03-26 14:00:00  0.469\n     2017-03-26 15:00:00  0.318\n     2017-03-26 16:00:00 -0.134\n     2017-03-26 17:00:00 -0.201\n     2017-03-26 18:00:00 -0.804\n     2017-03-26 19:00:00 -0.888\n     2017-03-26 20:00:00 -0.837\n     2017-03-26 21:00:00 -1.239\n     2017-03-26 22:00:00 -0.235\n     2017-03-26 23:00:00  0.452\n\n     Then repeat for the next three days.\n\n 34. We'll generate the dates programmatically in our mind:\n\n     Day2: 2017-03-27: same values, with date from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n     Day3: 2017-03-28\n     Day4: 2017-03-29\n\n 35. We output 96 lines.\n\n 36. Note: This is a simple average method. In practice, we might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints and the small data, this is reasonable.\n\n 37.
