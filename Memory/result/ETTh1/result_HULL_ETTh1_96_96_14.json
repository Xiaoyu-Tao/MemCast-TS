        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-26 00:00:00 to 2016-08-29 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-08-30 00:00:00 to 2016-09-02 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 24*4=96 exactly).\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history and the hourly data, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not evident).\n 4. We'll use a model that can capture seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 points and we have 96 points of history, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n    - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data is only 4 days, so the seasonal pattern might not be very stable. We might also consider a simple method like using the average of the same hour in the past days.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we have to provide a forecast for 96 points without any missing values.\n\n Approach using average by hour:\n   - We have 4 days of data. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (which is 96 hours).\n\n   But note: the data starts on 2016-08-26 (Friday) and ends on 2016-08-29 (Monday). The next 4 days would be Tuesday to Friday? Actually:\n        Aug 26: Friday\n        Aug 27: Saturday\n        Aug 28: Sunday\n        Aug 29: Monday\n        Then next 96 hours: \n            Aug 30: Tuesday\n            Aug 31: Wednesday\n            Sep 1: Thursday\n            Sep 2: Friday\n\n   Since we have only 4 days (with different days of the week), the average by hour might not capture weekly patterns. But we don't have multiple weeks.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last day (Aug 29) as the forecast for the next day (Aug 30), then use the average of the same hour for the next days? \n    But the problem is we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n 7. Given the simplicity and the fact that we must provide 96 values, we can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 available days and then repeat that for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n   - Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n Example:\n   Hour 00:00: average of [2016-08-26 00:00:00, 2016-08-27 00:00:00, 2016-08-28 00:00:00, 2016-08-29 00:00:00]\n   ... and so on for each hour.\n\n 8. However, note that the data might have a trend? But 4 days is too short to capture a trend. We'll assume the pattern is stable.\n\n 9. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (6.095 + 5.358 + 4.823 + 3.751) / 4 = (6.095+5.358+4.823+3.751)=20.027 /4 = 5.00675\n    Hour 1: (5.626 + 4.354 + 4.421 + 3.751) / 4 = (5.626+4.354+4.421+3.751)=18.152 /4 = 4.538\n    ... and so on.\n\n 10. Then we generate 4 days of these 24 hourly averages.\n\n 11. But note: the next 4 days are 4 consecutive days? We are just repeating the same daily pattern.\n\n 12. This method is simple and handles the data without missing values.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model, but with only 96 points and the need for 96 forecasts, and without a clear trend or complex seasonality, the average method is acceptable.\n\n 14. We'll compute the hourly averages and then create the next 96 points.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We have 4 days, each with 24 hours -> 96 records.\n\n   We can reshape the data into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean for each column.\n\n 15. Let's do the averages:\n\n     hour0 = [6.095, 5.358, 4.823, 3.751] -> mean = (6.095+5.358+4.823+3.751)/4 = 5.00675\n     hour1 = [5.626, 4.354, 4.421, 3.751] -> 4.538\n     hour2 = [4.555, 6.430, 3.818, 4.019] -> (4.555+6.430+3.818+4.019)/4 = 4.7055\n     hour3 = [7.301, 6.631, 3.416, 4.019] -> (7.301+6.631+3.416+4.019)/4 = 5.34175\n     hour4 = [5.291, 5.626, 3.349, 3.349] -> (5.291+5.626+3.349+3.349)/4 = 4.40375\n     hour5 = [6.966, 5.492, 4.086, 3.014] -> (6.966+5.492+4.086+3.014)/4 = 4.8895\n     hour6 = [5.626, 7.502, 3.148, 4.488] -> (5.626+7.502+3.148+4.488)/4 = 5.191\n     hour7 = [5.760, 4.823, 4.287, 4.756] -> (5.760+4.823+4.287+4.756)/4 = 4.9065\n     hour8 = [6.162, 4.086, 3.282, 4.622] -> (6.162+4.086+3.282+4.622)/4 = 4.538\n     hour9 = [5.760, 3.148, 4.756, 5.224] -> (5.760+3.148+4.756+5.224)/4 = 4.722\n     hour10 = [5.023, 4.421, 5.023, 5.425] -> (5.023+4.421+5.023+5.425)/4 = 4.973\n     hour11 = [4.957, 4.689, 4.957, 4.756] -> (4.957+4.689+4.957+4.756)/4 = 4.83975\n     hour12 = [3.818, 3.952, 3.349, 4.019] -> (3.818+3.952+3.349+4.019)/4 = 3.7845\n     hour13 = [3.684, 3.617, 4.086, 4.622] -> (3.684+3.617+4.086+4.622)/4 = 4.00225\n     hour14 = [4.354, 4.689, 4.756, 4.689] -> (4.354+4.689+4.756+4.689)/4 = 4.622\n     hour15 = [4.086, 3.885, 3.349, 4.756] -> (4.086+3.885+3.349+4.756)/4 = 4.019\n     hour16 = [3.751, 3.885, 4.086, 4.957] -> (3.751+3.885+4.086+4.957)/4 = 4.16975\n     hour17 = [3.416, 4.220, 3.751, 4.555] -> (3.416+4.220+3.751+4.555)/4 = 3.9855\n     hour18 = [3.081, 3.751, 3.483, 3.952] -> (3.081+3.751+3.483+3.952)/4 = 3.56675\n     hour19 = [2.478, 3.282, 3.081, 3.148] -> (2.478+3.282+3.081+3.148)/4 = 2.99725\n     hour20 = [2.612, 3.282, 3.617, 3.416] -> (2.612+3.282+3.617+3.416)/4 = 3.23175\n     hour21 = [2.545, 2.679, 3.349, 3.818] -> (2.545+2.679+3.349+3.818)/4 = 3.09775\n     hour22 = [4.153, 3.952, 3.818, 4.890] -> (4.153+3.952+3.818+4.890)/4 = 4.20325\n     hour23 = [3.081, 5.224, 4.354, 5.626] -> (3.081+5.224+4.354+5.626)/4 = 4.57125\n\n 16. Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating these 24 hourly averages for 4 days.\n\n 17. The dates: \n      Start: 2016-08-30 00:00:00 (Tuesday)\n      Then: 2016-08-30 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-02 23:00:00.\n\n 18. We'll generate the dates and then assign the corresponding hourly average.\n\n 19. Format: \n        date                HULL\n        2016-08-30 00:00:00 5.00675\n        2016-08-30 01:00:00 4.538\n        ... \n\n 20. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 21. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 22. We'll output the data with the same precision (3 decimal places) as the input.\n\n 23. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the exact computed value and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 25. We'll round each average to 3 decimals.\n\n 26. The averages rounded:\n\n    hour0: 5.007\n    hour1: 4.538\n    hour2: 4.706\n    (but 4.7055 -> 4.706? Let's round: 4.7055 -> 4.706? Actually, 4.7055 is exactly halfway? But in Python, rounding 4.7055 to 3 decimals: \n        The rule: 4.7055 * 1000 = 4705.5 -> round to even? \n        However, we can use standard rounding: round(4.7055, 3) -> 4.706.\n\n    We'll round each to 3 decimals.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can use the exact value and then format to 3 decimals.\n\n 28. We'll compute the averages and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 29. Let me recalc with rounding:\n\n    hour0: (6.095+5.358+4.823+3.751)/4 = 20.027/4 = 5.00675 -> 5.007\n    hour1: 18.152/4 = 4.538 -> 4.538\n    hour2: (4.555+6.430+3.818+4.019)=18.822 -> 18.822/4=4.7055 -> 4.706\n    hour3: (7.301+6.631+3.416+4.019)=21.367 -> 21.367/4=5.34175 -> 5.342\n    hour4: (5.291+5.626+3.349+3.349)=17.615 -> 17.615/4=4.40375 -> 4.404\n    hour5: (6.966+5.492+4.086+3.014)=19.558 -> 19.558/4=4.8895 -> 4.890\n    hour6: (5.626+7.502+3.148+4.488)=20.764 -> 20.764/4=5.191 -> 5.191\n    hour7: (5.760+4.823+4.287+4.756)=19.626 -> 19.626/4=4.9065 -> 4.907\n    hour8: (6.162+4.086+3.282+4.622)=18.152 -> 18.152/4=4.538 -> 4.538\n    hour9: (5.760+3.148+4.756+5.224)=18.888 -> 18.888/4=4.722 -> 4.722\n    hour10: (5.023+4.421+5.023+5.425)=19.892 -> 19.892/4=4.973 -> 4.973\n    hour11: (4.957+4.689+4.957+4.756)=19.359 -> 19.359/4=4.83975 -> 4.840\n    hour12: (3.818+3.952+3.349+4.019)=15.138 -> 15.138/4=3.7845 -> 3.785\n    hour13: (3.684+3.617+4.086+4.622)=16.009 -> 16.009/4=4.00225 -> 4.002\n    hour14: (4.354+4.689+4.756+4.689)=18.488 -> 18.488/4=4.622 -> 4.622\n    hour15: (4.086+3.885+3.349+4.756)=16.076 -> 16.076/4=4.019 -> 4.019\n    hour16: (3.751+3.885+4.086+4.957)=16.679 -> 16.679/4=4.16975 -> 4.170\n    hour17: (3.416+4.220+3.751+4.555)=15.942 -> 15.942/4=3.9855 -> 3.986\n    hour18: (3.081+3.751+3.483+3.952)=14.267 -> 14.267/4=3.56675 -> 3.567\n    hour19: (2.478+3.282+3.081+3.148)=11.989 -> 11.989/4=2.99725 -> 2.997\n    hour20: (2.612+3.282+3.617+3.416)=12.927 -> 12.927/4=3.23175 -> 3.232\n    hour21: (2.545+2.679+3.349+3.818)=12.391 -> 12.391/4=3.09775 -> 3.098\n    hour22: (4.153+3.952+3.818+4.890)=16.813 -> 16.813/4=4.20325 -> 4.203\n    hour23: (3.081+5.224+4.354+5.626)=18.285 -> 18.285/4=4.57125 -> 4.571\n\n 30. Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n      Day1: 2016-08-30 (Tuesday) -> hours 0 to 23: [5.007, 4.538, 4.706, 5.342, 4.404, 4.890, 5.191, 4.907, 4.538, 4.722, 4.973, 4.840, 3.785, 4.002, 4.622, 4.019, 4.170, 3.986, 3.567, 2.997, 3.232, 3.098, 4.203, 4.571]\n      Day2: 2016-08-31 (Wednesday) -> same pattern\n      Day3: 2016-09-01 (Thursday) -> same pattern\n      Day4: 2016-09-02 (Friday) -> same pattern\n\n 31. We'll generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-08-30 00:00:00\n      Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 32. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n 33. Note: The input data ended at 2016-08-29 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-08-30 00:00:00.\n\n 34. We output:\n\n        2016-08-30 00:00:00 5.007\n        2016-08-30 01:00:00 4.538\n        ... \n        2016-08-30 23:00:00 4.571\n        2016-08-31 00:00:00 5.007\n        ... \n        2016-09-02 23:00:00 4.571\n\n 35. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 36. Let's do it.\n\n 37. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 38. We note that the method is very simple and might not capture any trends or changing seasonality, but with the limited data, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 39.
