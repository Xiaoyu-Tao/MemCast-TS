        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be cautious. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we can proceed to model the time series.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly data, we might consider a model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast (without missing any point) and the data is relatively short (96 points),\n    we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend. The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, note that we are only given 4 days of data (96 hours) and we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 5. Given the limited data, we can try to fit a model. But note: the data has a clear daily pattern? Let's observe:\n\n    - The data on each day shows a similar pattern: \n        * Lower values during the day (from 00:00 to around 06:00-08:00) and then a drop? But looking at the data, it's not very clear.\n\n    However, due to the short history, we might not have enough cycles to capture weekly patterns, but we do have 4 days.\n\n 6. We can use a simple approach: \n    - Since the data is short, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But note the requirement for 96 points.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n    - Use the last day (24 hours) as the forecast for the next day? But the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we are to provide a forecast, we can use a model that can handle seasonality. We choose a seasonal naive model as a baseline? \n    But the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated model.\n\n 9. We can use the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive seasonality) because we have a fixed seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n    However, note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the last few points: \n        2016-07-20 20:00:00 11.989\n        2016-07-20 21:00:00 11.989\n        2016-07-20 22:00:00 15.271\n        2016-07-20 23:00:00 14.937\n\n    The data does not show a clear long-term trend over 4 days, but daily fluctuations.\n\n 10. We will use ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels with a seasonal period of 24, but note that we have only 4 days (4 cycles) which is minimal for fitting.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a SARIMA model. However, with only 96 points, we might overfit if we try to fit a complex SARIMA.\n\n 12. Given the above, we decide to use Holt-Winters (ExponentialSmoothing) with additive trend and additive seasonality of period 24.\n\n 13. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Import ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels.\n     - Fit the model on the 96 points with seasonal_periods=24, trend='add', seasonal='add'.\n     - Forecast the next 96 steps.\n\n 14. But note: we are not coding, we are to provide the forecasted values. However, we must generate the forecast.\n\n 15. Since we cannot run code in this environment, we have to rely on a precomputed forecast? But we are an AI, we can simulate the process.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: \n      - We can take the last 24 hours and repeat them 4 times? But that would be 96 hours. However, the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n 17. We observe the data:\n\n      Day1: 2016-07-17: \n          00:00: 10.181, 01:00: 10.047, ... 23:00: 14.267\n      Day2: 2016-07-18: \n          00:00: 14.535, ... 23:00: 12.056\n      Day3: 2016-07-19: \n          00:00: 13.597, ... 23:00: 10.650\n      Day4: 2016-07-20: \n          00:00: 13.530, ... 23:00: 14.937\n\n      The pattern: \n        - The values at 00:00: 10.181, 14.535, 13.597, 13.530 -> average around 12.96\n        - The values at 01:00: 10.047, 15.874, 13.798, 13.329 -> average around 13.26\n\n      But note: we are to predict the next 4 days. We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n\n      However, that would be too simplistic and ignore any trend.\n\n 18. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, but then we have 24 different averages. Then we repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n      Let A_h = (value_hour_h on day1 + value_hour_h on day2 + value_hour_h on day3 + value_hour_h on day4) / 4, for h in 0..23.\n\n      Then the forecast for day5 at hour h: A_h, day6 at hour h: A_h, etc.\n\n 19. But note: the data might have a slight trend? We can also adjust by the overall trend. However, the trend over 4 days is not clear.\n\n 20. We can compute the overall average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (10.181 + 14.535 + 13.597 + 13.530) / 4 = (51.843)/4 = 12.96075\n        hour1: (10.047 + 15.874 + 13.798 + 13.329) / 4 = (53.048)/4 = 13.262\n        ... and so on.\n\n 21. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) would be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 22. However, we must be cautious: the last day (2016-07-20) had a spike at 22:00 (15.271) and 23:00 (14.937). This might indicate an increasing trend? \n     But the previous days did not have such high values at that hour. So the average might smooth that.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the last day has more weight? But without a clear trend, we stick to the average.\n\n 24. We calculate the average for each hour of the day (over the 4 days) and then repeat that for 4 days.\n\n 25. Steps to calculate:\n\n      We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We group by the hour of the day (i.e., the time part: 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and average.\n\n 26. Let's compute a few:\n\n      hour00: [10.181, 14.535, 13.597, 13.530] -> average = (10.181+14.535+13.597+13.530)/4 = 51.843/4 = 12.96075\n      hour01: [10.047, 15.874, 13.798, 13.329] -> 53.048/4 = 13.262\n      hour02: [9.779, 15.137, 12.726, 12.257] -> (9.779+15.137+12.726+12.257)=49.899/4=12.47475\n      hour03: [8.439, 14.468, 11.387, 11.186] -> (8.439+14.468+11.387+11.186)=45.48/4=11.37\n      hour04: [9.042, 12.190, 12.525, 11.788] -> (9.042+12.190+12.525+11.788)=45.545/4=11.38625\n      hour05: [9.310, 12.793, 12.056, 12.257] -> (9.310+12.793+12.056+12.257)=46.416/4=11.604\n      hour06: [11.454, 13.195, 10.784, 13.128] -> (11.454+13.195+10.784+13.128)=48.561/4=12.14025\n      hour07: [7.703, 13.597, 8.573, 11.119] -> (7.703+13.597+8.573+11.119)=40.992/4=10.248\n      hour08: [7.837, 9.913, 8.707, 8.038] -> (7.837+9.913+8.707+8.038)=34.495/4=8.62375\n      hour09: [7.770, 8.105, 9.645, 8.707] -> (7.770+8.105+9.645+8.707)=34.227/4=8.55675\n      hour10: [9.176, 8.975, 9.645, 10.382] -> (9.176+8.975+9.645+10.382)=38.178/4=9.5445\n      hour11: [9.645, 9.310, 9.511, 10.181] -> (9.645+9.310+9.511+10.181)=38.647/4=9.66175\n      hour12: [7.636, 7.636, 7.703, 8.038] -> Actually, the 12th hour of each day: \n            day1: 7.636, day2: 7.636, day3: 7.703, day4: 8.038 -> (7.636+7.636+7.703+8.038)=31.013/4=7.75325\n      hour13: [8.038, 8.239, 7.904, 8.707] -> (8.038+8.239+7.904+8.707)=32.888/4=8.222\n      hour14: [8.372, 8.707, 7.502, 9.377] -> (8.372+8.707+7.502+9.377)=33.958/4=8.4895\n      hour15: [8.372, 7.904, 9.578, 9.377] -> (8.372+7.904+9.578+9.377)=35.231/4=8.80775\n      hour16: [7.703, 8.439, 7.904, 8.506] -> (7.703+8.439+7.904+8.506)=32.552/4=8.138\n      hour17: [8.506, 8.506, 8.372, 8.975] -> (8.506+8.506+8.372+8.975)=34.359/4=8.58975\n      hour18: [8.306, 8.372, 7.837, 9.042] -> (8.306+8.372+7.837+9.042)=33.557/4=8.38925\n      hour19: [8.105, 8.172, 7.636, 8.506] -> (8.105+8.172+7.636+8.506)=32.419/4=8.10475\n      hour20: [9.913, 10.516, 9.645, 11.989] -> (9.913+10.516+9.645+11.989)=42.063/4=10.51575\n      hour21: [10.248, 11.454, 9.578, 11.989] -> (10.248+11.454+9.578+11.989)=43.269/4=10.81725\n      hour22: [12.458, 12.458, 8.439, 15.271] -> (12.458+12.458+8.439+15.271)=48.626/4=12.1565\n      hour23: [14.267, 12.056, 10.650, 14.937] -> (14.267+12.056+10.650+14.937)=51.91/4=12.9775\n\n 27. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-07-21): [12.96075, 13.262, 12.47475, 11.37, ... , 12.9775] (the 24 averages in order)\n        Day2 (2016-07-22): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (2016-07-23): same\n        Day4 (2016-07-24): same\n\n 28. However, note that the last day (2016-07-20) had a higher value at hour22 (15.271) and hour23 (14.937) than the average (12.1565 and 12.9775). \n     But we are averaging over 4 days, so it's smoothed.\n\n 29. This method is simple and we have to provide a forecast. We'll use the average per hour.\n\n 30. Format: we must output 96 lines, starting from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00, with the HUFL value as the average for that hour.\n\n 31. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 32. Let's write the forecast:\n\n      First day (2016-07-21):\n        00:00:00 -> 12.961\n        01:00:00 -> 13.262\n        02:00:00 -> 12.475\n        03:00:00 -> 11.370\n        04:00:00 -> 11.386\n        05:00:00 -> 11.604\n        06:00:00 -> 12.140\n        07:00:00 -> 10.248\n        08:00:00 -> 8.624\n        09:00:00 -> 8.557\n        10:00:00 -> 9.545\n        11:00:00 -> 9.662\n        12:00:00 -> 7.753\n        13:00:00 -> 8.222\n        14:00:00 -> 8.490\n        15:00:00 -> 8.808\n        16:00:00 -> 8.138\n        17:00:00 -> 8.590\n        18:00:00 -> 8.389\n        19:00:00 -> 8.105\n        20:00:00 -> 10.516\n        21:00:00 -> 10.817\n        22:00:00 -> 12.157\n        23:00:00 -> 12.978\n\n      Then repeat the same 24 values for the next three days.\n\n 33. But note: the dates must be incremented by one day at a time. We start at 2016-07-21 00:00:00 and go to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-21 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        Day2: 2016-07-22 00:00:00 to 2016-07-22 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2016-07-23 00:00:00 to 2016-07-23 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2016-07-24 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00\n\n 35. We output the same 24 values for each day.\n\n 36. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided data there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 37. We write the forecast in the required format.\n\n 38. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates.\n\n 39. Let's code the output:\n\n        We have a list of 24 values (the averages) and we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 40. The list of averages (rounded to 3 decimals) for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n        hour0: 12.961\n        hour1: 13.262\n        hour2: 12.475\n        hour3: 11.370\n        hour4: 11.386\n        hour5: 11.604\n        hour6: 12.140\n        hour7: 10.248\n        hour8: 8.624\n        hour9: 8.557\n        hour10: 9.545\n        hour11: 9.662\n        hour12: 7.753\n        hour13: 8.222\n        hour14: 8.490\n        hour15: 8.808\n        hour16: 8.138\n        hour17: 8.590\n        hour18: 8.389\n        hour19: 8.105\n        hour20: 10.516\n        hour21: 10.817\n        hour22: 12.157\n        hour23: 12.978\n\n 41. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-21 00:00:00 -> 12.961\n               2016-07-21 01:00:00 -> 13.262\n               ... until 2016-07-21 23:00:00 -> 12.978\n\n        Then 2016-07-22 00:00:00 -> 12.961\n        ... and so on.\n\n 42. We write the answer in the required XML-like format.\n\n 43. Note: The user might expect a more sophisticated forecast? But given the constraints (no code, short data) we use this method.\n\n 44. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns: date and HUFL, with the date in the same format.\n\n 45. We must not omit any content.\n\n 46. We write the answer.\n",
