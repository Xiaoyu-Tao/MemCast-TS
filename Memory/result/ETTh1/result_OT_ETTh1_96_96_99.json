        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the data might have missing values? In the provided data, we have 96 consecutive hours without missing values? \n But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". In the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing? \n But the forecasting must account for the possibility of missing values? Actually, the instruction is about the provided data having missing values? \n But the data you provided seems complete? \n\n Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", we must handle missing values in the input? \n However, the provided 96 points are complete. So for forecasting, we can use the complete data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead (hourly).\n 2. We note that the data has a daily pattern? Let's check: \n    The data shows a pattern that repeats every 24 hours? But looking at the data, it's not very strong? \n    However, we can try to model with a seasonal component of 24.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality? But here we only have hourly data and we are forecasting hourly.\n\n 4. Since the data is relatively short (only 4 days) and we are forecasting 4 days, we can use a simple model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any) \n    - Seasonality (daily: 24 hours)\n\n 5. We can use an additive model or multiplicative model? The variation seems to be additive? \n\n 6. We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? Or use exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal component (SARIMA). \n\n 8. Given the small data, we can try to fit a model and forecast.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. \n So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n But the problem says: \"be aware of that\" meaning we should handle missing values? \n Since the provided data is complete, we don't need to impute for the training data. But for the forecasting, we are to produce 96 points without missing.\n\n 9. We are to output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n Approach:\n We'll use a SARIMA model. We have to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). \n\n Steps:\n - Check stationarity: if not stationary, we may need to difference.\n - We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters? But we are not allowed to run code? \n\n Since we are an expert, we have to make an educated guess.\n\n Observing the data: \n   The data does not show a strong trend? It fluctuates around a mean? \n   But let's a drop on 2017-08-02 and then a rise on 2017-08-04? \n\n We can try:\n   d = 1 (to remove trend) and D = 1 (for seasonal differencing) with period 24.\n\n But with only 4 days, we have to be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing? \n\n However, the problem requires 96 points and we must be accurate.\n\n Given the complexity, we can use a naive method? But that won't be accurate.\n\n Since we are an expert, we can use a model that is known to work for such series: \n   We'll use a model with:\n     p=1, d=0, q=1 (non-seasonal) and P=1, D=1, Q=0, seasonal period=24.\n\n But without running the model, we have to simulate the forecast? \n\n Actually, we are an AI and we can simulate the process? But we are not running code? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n   We can take the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n For example, for the first hour of the next day (2017-08-05 00:00:00), we take the average of the 00:00:00 of the previous 4 days? \n But we only have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th of August.\n\n So for hour 00:00:00, we have:\n   2017-08-01 00:00:00: 17.868000\n   2017-08-02 00:00:00: 15.758000\n   2017-08-03 00:00:00: 12.803000\n   2017-08-04 00:00:00: 16.813000\n\n Average = (17.868 + 15.758 + 12.803 + 16.813) / 4 = 15.8105\n\n But note: the data on 2017-08-02 and 2017-08-03 are lower? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-04) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Since we are not actually running a model, we have to generate the data? \n\n But note: the problem says \"You are an expert\", so we can use a standard method and then generate the numbers? \n\n However, the problem does not require a specific method. We can use a simple average method per hour? \n\n Steps for the simple method:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have? \n   Then we use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days? \n\n But wait, we are forecasting 4 days? So we can repeat the same daily pattern? \n\n However, the data shows that the pattern changes? For example, the temperature on 2017-08-04 is generally higher? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-04) and then adjust by the average of the differences between consecutive days? \n\n But we are not sure.\n\n Given the constraints, we must produce 96 numbers. \n\n We decide to use the average per hour over the 4 days? \n\n Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (17.868 + 15.758 + 12.803 + 16.813) / 4 = 15.8105\n   hour1: (17.798 + 14.843 + 12.944 + 16.461) / 4 = 15.5115\n   ... and so on.\n\n Then for the next 4 days (2017-08-05 to 2017-08-08), we assign the same average for each hour? \n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast, so we don't have missing? \n\n However, the problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You must provide the complete data\".\n\n So we'll generate 96 points without missing.\n\n But is this method good? It ignores any trend? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-04) and then add a small random fluctuation? But we are not allowed to add randomness? \n\n We can use the average per hour and then for each day we add a drift? \n\n However, without a clear trend, we stick to the average.\n\n But note: the data on 2017-08-04 is the most recent and might be more relevant? \n\n We can use a weighted average? More weight to the last day? \n\n We can do: \n   For each hour, we take the average of the last two days? \n\n But we have 4 days? \n\n We can use exponential smoothing? \n\n We decide to use the average of the last two days (2017-08-03 and 2017-08-04) for each hour? \n\n Why? Because the last two days might be more representative? \n\n Let's see: \n   The first two days (2017-08-01 and 2017-08-02) have lower temperatures? \n\n So for hour0: (12.803 + 16.813) / 2 = 14.808\n hour1: (12.944 + 16.461) / 2 = 14.7025\n\n But then the forecast for 2017-08-05 00:00:00 would be 14.808? \n\n However, the last day (2017-08-04) had 16.813 at hour0? and the day before that (2017-08-03) had 12.803? \n The average is 14.808, which is lower than the last day? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day as the forecast? \n\n But that would be a naive forecast: repeating the last day? \n\n We can do: \n   For the next day (2017-08-05), we use the same as 2017-08-04? \n   Then for 2017-08-06, we use the same as 2017-08-03? (because 2017-08-03 is the same day of the week? but we don't have day of week) \n   But we don't know the day of week? \n\n Since we don't have information about the day of week, we assume the pattern is daily? \n\n We can repeat the last day (2017-08-04) for the next 4 days? \n\n But then we are ignoring the trend? \n\n However, the last day (2017-08-04) is the highest? \n\n We can do: \n   We use the last day (2017-08-04) and then for the next days, we add a small linear trend? \n\n But the trend from the last 4 days? \n\n Let's compute the overall average per day:\n\n   2017-08-01: average = (sum of 24 hours)/24\n   2017-08-02: ...\n   2017-08-03: ...\n   2017-08-04: ...\n\n Then we see the trend? \n\n But we don't have the time to compute? \n\n Given the complexity, we must provide an answer, we decide to use the average per hour over the last two days (2017-08-03 and 2017-08-04) for the next 4 days? \n\n But then we are repeating the same pattern for 4 days? \n\n We can do:\n\n   For day 2017-08-05: use the average of 2017-08-03 and 2017-08-04 for each hour? \n   For day 2017-08-06: use the same as 2017-08-05? \n   For day 2017-08-07: same as 2017-08-05?\n   For day 2017-08-08: same as 2017-08-05?\n\n But that would be repeating the same pattern? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire 4 days for each hour? \n\n We choose: average per hour over the 4 days.\n\n We calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) and then assign that average to the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for calculation:\n\n   hour0: (17.868000 + 15.758000 + 12.803000 + 16.813000) / 4 = 15.8105\n   hour1: (17.798000 + 14.843000 + 12.944000 + 16.461000) / 4 = 15.5115\n   hour2: (17.516001 + 15.054000 + 12.029000 + 16.601999) / 4 = 15.30025\n   hour3: (17.798000 + 15.265000 + 15.336000 + 16.601999) / 4 = 16.25025\n   hour4: (17.094000 + 14.773000 + 15.898000 + 16.672001) / 4 = 16.10925\n   hour5: (16.672001 + 15.125000 + 16.320999 + 16.320999) / 4 = 16.10975\n   hour6: (16.743000 + 12.944000 + 16.320999 + 16.601999) / 4 = 15.6525\n   hour7: (16.601999 + 14.210000 + 16.954000 + 17.235001) / 4 = 16.2500\n   hour8: (17.024000 + 14.843000 + 17.587000 + 18.009001) / 4 = 16.86575\n   hour9: (16.250000 + 15.476000 + 16.882999 + 18.361000) / 4 = 16.7425\n   hour10: (16.461000 + 15.547000 + 17.305000 + 18.783001) / 4 = 17.024\n   hour11: (16.250000 + 15.828000 + 16.954000 + 19.627001) / 4 = 17.16475\n   hour12: (17.165001 + 15.969000 + 16.954000 + 17.798000) / 4 = 16.9715\n   hour13: (17.445999 + 16.532000 + 17.165001 + 14.351000) / 4 = 16.3735\n   hour14: (18.431000 + 14.914000 + 13.999000 + 19.908001) / 4 = 16.813\n   hour15: (17.587000 + 16.108999 + 14.843000 + 20.541000) / 4 = 17.27\n   hour16: (17.235001 + 16.461000 + 17.094000 + 20.260000) / 4 = 17.7625\n   hour17: (16.813000 + 15.476000 + 17.094000 + 21.455999) / 4 = 17.70975\n   hour18: (16.250000 + 12.803000 + 17.165001 + 20.681999) / 4 = 16.725\n   hour19: (15.828000 + 12.944000 + 16.882999 + 19.275000) / 4 = 16.2325\n   hour20: (15.898000 + 13.436000 + 16.813000 + 18.853001) / 4 = 16.25\n   hour21: (16.320999 + 15.617000 + 16.601999 + 18.993999) / 4 = 16.8835\n   hour22: (16.672001 + 16.391001 + 16.672001 + 18.993999) / 4 = 17.18225\n   hour23: (15.547000 + 14.703000 + 16.532000 + 18.783001) / 4 = 16.39125\n\n Then for the next 4 days (2017-08-05 to 2017-08-08), we assign:\n\n   Day1 (2017-08-05): \n        00:00:00 -> 15.8105\n        01:00:00 -> 15.5115\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 16.39125\n\n   Day2 (2017-08-06): same as Day1\n   Day3 (2017-08-07): same as Day1\n   Day4 (2017-08-08): same as Day1\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?

\n\n   We can compute the daily average:\n\n        Day1: (17.868+17.798+17.516+17.798+17.094+16.672+16.743+16.602+17.024+16.25+16.461+16.25+17.165+17.446+18.431+17.587+17.235+16.813+16.25+15.828+15.898+16.321+16.672+15.547) / 24\n        We can approximate: around 16.8?

\n\n        But note: the pattern might be additive? \n\n        Alternatively, we can shift the entire pattern by the difference: \n          For day5: shift = 17.5 - 16.556 = 0.944\n          Then for each hour, we do: base_hourly_avg + 0.944\n\n        Similarly for the other days.\n\n        We choose additive because the trend is additive? \n\n        So:\n\n          Day5: each hour = base_hourly_avg + (17.5 - 16.556) = base_hourly_avg + 0.944\n          Day6: base_hourly_avg + (17.94 - 16.556) = base_hourly_avg + 1.384\n          Day7: base_hourly_avg + (18.38 - 16.556) = base_hourly_avg + 1.824\n          Day8: base_hourly_avg + (18.82 - 16.556) = base_hourly_avg + 2.264\n\n        Then we compute for each hour in each day.\n\n        But note: the base_hourly_avg we computed is the average over the 4 days? \n\n        This method might be better.\n\n        Let's do it.\n\n        Example for 2017-08-05 00:00:00:\n          base = 15.8105\n          then 15.8105 + 0.944 = 16.7545\n\n        For 2017-08-06 00:00:00:\n          base = 15.8105\n          then 15.8105 + 1.384 = 17.1945\n\n        And so on.\n\n        We have to do this for all 24 hours for 4 days.\n\n        We'll generate 96 points.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places? The original data has 3 decimal places.\n\n        But note: the original data has up to 3 decimal places? Actually, it has 6 decimal places? But the values are given with 3 decimal places? \n\n        We see: 17.868000 -> 17.868, so we can output 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll compute the base hourly averages (from the 4 days) and then add the daily shift.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          base_hour = [15.8105, 15.5115, 15.30025, 16.25025, 16.10925, 16.10975, 15.6525, 16.25, 16.86575, 16.7425, 17.024, 17.16475, 16.9715, 16.3735, 16.813, 17.27, 17.7625, 17.70975, 16.725, 16.2325, 16.25, 16.8835, 17.18225, 16.39125]\n\n          shifts = [0.944, 1.384, 1.824, 2.264]   # for day5, day6, day7, day8\n\n          Then for day i (0-indexed: i=0 for day5, i=1 for day6, etc.) and hour j (0 to 23):\n               value = base_hour[j] + shifts[i]\n\n        We generate:\n\n          Day5 (2017-08-05): \n              00: 15.8105 + 0.944 = 16.7545 -> 16.755\n              01: 15.5115 + 0.944 = 16.4555 -> 16.456\n              ... \n\n          Day6 (2017-08-06): \n              00: 15.8105 + 1.384 = 17.1945 -> 17.195\n              01: 15.5115 + 1.384 = 16.8955 -> 16.896\n\n          etc.\n\n        We have to generate 4 days.\n\n        We must output the dates: \n          Start from 2017-08-05 00:00:00, then 2017-08-05 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n\n        We have to be careful: the last date in the input is 2017-08-04 23:00:00.\n\n        Next date: 2017-08-05 00:00:00.\n\n        We output 96 lines.\n\n        We'll format the date as string: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n        And the OT value as float with 3 decimal places? \n\n        But the input has 6 decimal places? But they are zeros? So we can output 3 decimal places? \n\n        Actually, we can output with 6 decimal places? But the input has 6, so we do the same.\n\n        We'll compute the numbers and then format to 6 decimal places by padding with zeros? \n\n        Example: 16.7545 -> 16.754500? \n\n        But the input has: 17.868000 -> so we output 16.754500? \n\n        However, we can output with 3 decimal places? The input has 3 significant decimals? \n\n        We'll output with 6 decimal places as string formatting: \n\n          \"{:.6f}\".format(x)\n\n        But we are writing in text.\n\n        We'll do: \n          for i in range(4):   # for each day\n            for j in range(24): # for each hour\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=i, hours=j)\n                value = base_hour[j] + shifts[i]\n\n        The start_date for the forecast is 2017-08-05 00:00:00.\n\n        We have to generate:\n\n          2017-08-05 00:00:00 <value>\n          2017-08-05 01:00:00 <value>\n          ...\n\n        We'll compute the value and round to 6 decimal places? \n\n        Actually, we can keep the float as is and format to 6 decimal places.\n\n        But note: the shifts and base_hour are computed with more precision? \n\n        We'll use:\n\n          base_hour = [ \n            15.8105, 15.5115, 15.30025, 16.25025, 16.10925, 16.10975, 15.6525, 16.25, \n            16.86575, 16.7425, 17.024, 17.16475, 16.9715, 16.3735, 16.813, 17.27, \n            17.7625, 17.70975, 16.725, 16.2325, 16.25, 16.8835, 17.18225, 16.39125\n          ]\n\n          shifts = [0.944, 1.384, 1.824, 2.264]\n\n        Then for each (i, j) we compute: value = base_hour[j] + shifts[i]\n\n        And then format to 6 decimal places: \n            formatted_value = \"{:.6f}\".format(value)\n\n        But note: the base_hour values are averages of 4 numbers, and we used 6 decimal places? Actually, we used more than 3? \n\n        We'll use the base_hour as we computed.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the base_hour for hour0: \n          (17.868000+15.758000+12.803000+16.813000)/4 = 63.242/4 = 15.8105 -> which is 15.810500 if we want 6 decimals.\n\n        So we can use base_hour with 6 decimals? \n\n          base_hour = [ \n            round((17.868000+15.758000+12.803000+16.813000)/4, 6) = 15.810500,\n            ... \n          ]\n\n        But we already computed with more precision? \n\n        We'll recompute each base_hour with 6 decimal precision? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          base_hour = []\n          for hour in range(24):\n              indices = [hour, hour+24, hour+48, hour+72]   # because 24 hours

 But we don't have the original data in a list? \n\n        We have the data in the string above? \n\n        We can extract? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the values we computed earlier and
