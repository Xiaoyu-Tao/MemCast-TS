        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 24*4=96).\n 3. We must choose a suitable time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history and the data showing some daily seasonality (patterns repeating every 24 hours),\n    we can use a model that captures seasonality. However, with only 4 days of data, it's challenging to capture weekly patterns, but we can try to capture daily patterns.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model like Seasonal Naive, where we forecast each hour by the value of the same hour in the previous day.\n    But note: the data shows some non-stationarity and the level changes.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components. However, the data is short (only 96 points) and we need 96 steps ahead.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we are not going to build a complex model. We can try to use a moving window of the last few days to capture the pattern.\n\n 7. Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, but in the provided data there are none, we can proceed without imputation for the historical part.\n\n 8. We decide to use a simple approach: \n    - We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24 hours). We can compute the average of each hour over the available 4 days and then adjust by the last day's trend.\n\n 9. However, note that the last day (2017-07-11) shows a different pattern? Let's see:\n\n    We have:\n        Day 1: 2017-07-08\n        Day 2: 2017-07-09\n        Day 3: 2017-07-10\n        Day 4: 2017-07-11\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the level of the series is changing. We might adjust by the last day's level.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the last day (2017-07-11) as the base and then add the average hourly deviation from the previous days? \n\n 11. We can do:\n     Let H(h) be the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n     For each hour h, compute the average of the same hour for the 4 days: \n        avg_h = (d1_h + d2_h + d3_h + d4_h) / 4\n\n     Then, we can compute the overall average of the last day (2017-07-11) as base_day_avg = mean of all 24 hours of 2017-07-11.\n\n     Then, for each hour h in the next 4 days, we set:\n        forecast_h = base_day_avg + (avg_h - overall_avg_of_all_days_at_hour_h)\n\n     But this might be too simplistic.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a seasonal naive forecast: \n        forecast for 2017-07-12 00:00:00 = value of 2017-07-11 00:00:00\n        forecast for 2017-07-12 01:00:00 = value of 2017-07-11 01:00:00\n        ... and so on for the next 24 hours.\n\n     Then for the next day (2017-07-13) we use the same values as 2017-07-12? But that would be the same as 2017-07-11 again? \n\n     Actually, we can use the last day (2017-07-11) for the entire next 4 days? That would be 4 repetitions of 2017-07-11.\n\n 13. However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day. But with only 4 days, it's hard to model a trend.\n\n 14. We note that the problem does not require a sophisticated model, and we choose the seasonal naive method for its simplicity and because it often works well for short-term seasonal data.\n\n     Specifically, we will use the last 24 hours (2017-07-11) as the pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours). \n\n     So, the forecast for:\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00 = 2017-07-11 00:00:00 = -0.914\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00 = 2017-07-11 01:00:00 = -0.944\n        ... until\n        2017-07-12 23:00:00 = 2017-07-11 23:00:00 = -0.518\n\n     Then for 2017-07-13 00:00:00 = 2017-07-11 00:00:00 = -0.914, and so on.\n\n 15. This method is called the Seasonal Naive method with season length 24.\n\n 16. We generate 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 17. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 18. Note: The provided data ends at 2017-07-11 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n        Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-07-15 23:00:00\n\n Implementation:\n\n     We have the last day (2017-07-11) as:\n        00:00:00: -0.914\n        01:00:00: -0.944\n        02:00:00: -1.036\n        03:00:00: -1.005\n        04:00:00: -1.005\n        05:00:00: -1.066\n        06:00:00: -0.883\n        07:00:00: -0.579\n        08:00:00:  0.426\n        09:00:00: -0.487\n        10:00:00: -0.426\n        11:00:00: -0.670\n        12:00:00: -0.609\n        13:00:00: -0.518\n        14:00:00: -0.518\n        15:00:00: -0.609\n        16:00:00: -0.640\n        17:00:00: -0.548\n        18:00:00: -0.670\n        19:00:00: -0.670\n        20:00:00: -0.640\n        21:00:00: -0.640\n        22:00:00: -0.548\n        23:00:00: -0.518\n\n     We will repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n 19. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 20. We must output the format exactly as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-12 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-07-12 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-07-15 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 21. Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the provided data? But in the given 96 points we don't have any. So we are safe.\n\n But what if the last day has missing? It doesn't. So we proceed.\n\n 22. We generate the next 96 hours by repeating the last 24 hours 4 times.\n\n 23. We write the dates by incrementing the last date (2017-07-11 23:00:00) by 1 hour to get 2017-07-12 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation in code (if we were coding) but we are to write the output.\n\n 24. We list:\n\n        Day 1: 12th July 2017: hours 0 to 23 -> values from 2017-07-11 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 13th July 2017: same values\n        Day 3: 14th July 2017: same values\n        Day 4: 15th July 2017: same values\n\n 25. We output the data in the same format as the input, with two columns: date and LULL.\n\n 26. We must not omit any content.\n\n Let's write the first few lines:\n\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00 -0.914\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00 -0.944\n        2017-07-12 02:00:00 -1.036\n        2017-07-12 03:00:00 -1.005\n        ... \n\n 27. We note that the last day provided is 2017-07-11, so the next day is 2017-07-12.\n\n 28. We generate 96 lines.\n\n 29. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are only given 96 points without missing. \n But in the forecast, we are generating without missing.\n\n 30. We are done.\n\n But wait: is there a better method? \n    We could also use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. Let's compare:\n\n        For hour 0:\n            Day1: -0.640, Day2: -0.792, Day3: -0.853, Day4: -0.914 -> average = (-0.640 -0.792 -0.853 -0.914)/4 = -0.1995*4? Actually: -3.199/4 = -0.79975\n\n        Then we would use -0.800 for the next 4 days at hour 0? \n\n    But the level of the series is decreasing? \n\n    Alternatively, we could use the last day as the base and then adjust by the average deviation from the mean? \n\n    However, the problem providing a metric for accuracy, we choose the simplest method that is often used: seasonal naive.\n\n 31. We stick with the seasonal naive.\n\n 32. We output the data.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00\n    Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n We have the values for the first 24 hours (day1 of forecast) = the 24 values of 2017-07-11.\n\n Then the next 24 hours (day2) = same 24 values.\n\n And so on.\n\n 33. We write the output.\n",
