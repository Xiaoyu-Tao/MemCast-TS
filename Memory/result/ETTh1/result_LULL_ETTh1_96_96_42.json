        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The data starts at 2016-12-16 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the data might have missing values. In the provided data, there are 96 consecutive hours without missing values? \n But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing? \n Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", we should consider that the provided data might have missing values? \n But in the given data, there are exactly 96 records without any gap. So we assume the provided history is complete.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. We note that the data has a daily seasonality (24 hours) and also weekly? But we only have 4 days, so weekly seasonality cannot be captured.\n 3. We can use a model that can handle hourly data with daily patterns.\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, we can use a simple model that captures:\n   - The daily pattern (using the average of each hour across the 4 days? or using a model like SARIMA with seasonality of 24)\n 4. However, note that the data does not perfectly repeat every day. We see variations.\n\n Given the small data size, we can try:\n   - Using the average of each hour (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not told that the next 96 will have missing? \n We are to provide the complete data for the next 96. So we must output 96 values without missing.\n\n Approach:\n   We can use a simple average by hour of day.\n\n   Steps:\n     - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n     - Then for the next 4 days (from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   However, we note that the data shows a trend? Let's check:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-12-16): \n        00:00: 0.640, 23:00: 0.609\n   Day 2 (2016-12-17): \n        00:00: 1.127, 23:00: 0.579\n   Day 3 (2016-12-18): \n        00:00: 0.609, 23:00: 0.640\n   Day 4 (2016-12-19): \n        00:00: 0.518, 23:00: 0.670\n\n   The pattern is not stable. But without more data, we cannot capture a weekly pattern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But with only 4 days, we can also use the last day (2016-12-19) as a base and adjust by the average daily profile? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the method. Since we are an expert, we choose a method that is simple and suitable for small data.\n\n   We decide to use the average by hour of the day. This will capture the intraday pattern and ignore any trend because we don't have enough data to model trend.\n\n   Steps for the average by hour:\n\n        hour0: (0.640 + 1.127 + 0.609 + 0.518) / 4 = \n        ... and so on for each hour.\n\n   Then we repeat this daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to capture weekly. Also, the next 4 days are from Tuesday to Friday? \n   The given data: \n        2016-12-16: Friday\n        2016-12-17: Saturday\n        2016-12-18: Sunday\n        2016-12-19: Monday\n\n   The next 4 days: \n        2016-12-20: Tuesday\n        2016-12-21: Wednesday\n        2016-12-22: Thursday\n        2016-12-23: Friday\n\n   We see that the pattern on Friday (2016-12-16) might be different from Saturday, Sunday, Monday. \n   we only have one Friday, one Saturday, one Sunday, one Monday. So we cannot average by day of week. \n\n   Therefore, we have two options:\n\n   Option 1: Use the same daily average for all days (ignoring day of week) and repeat for the next 4 days.\n\n   Option 2: Use the same day of the week pattern? But we only have one example for each day of the week? Then we can use:\n\n        For Tuesday: we don't have a Tuesday? So we cannot do that.\n\n   So we fall back to Option 1.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (0.640, 1.127, 0.609, 0.518) -> (0.640+1.127+0.609+0.518)/4 = 2.894/4 = 0.7235\n        hour1: (0.548, 1.127, 0.548, 0.487) -> (0.548+1.127+0.548+0.487)/4 = 2.71/4 = 0.6775\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.7235\n        2016-12-20 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.6775\n        ... until 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told that the history has missing? \n   We are given 96 points without missing. So we use the above.\n\n   However, we must output the data in the same format.\n\n   Format:\n\n        date (as index) and LULL value.\n\n   We generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2016-12-20 00:00:00, then 2016-12-20 01:00:00, ... until 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n\n   We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: (0.640, 1.127, 0.609, 0.518) -> 0.7235\n        hour1: (0.548, 1.127, 0.548, 0.487) -> 0.6775\n        hour2: (0.579, 1.097, 0.518, 0.548) -> (0.579+1.097+0.518+0.548)/4 = 2.742/4 = 0.6855\n        hour3: (0.457, 1.097, 0.640, 0.487) -> (0.457+1.097+0.640+0.487)/4 = 2.681/4 = 0.67025\n        hour4: (0.487, 1.066, 0.670, 0.670) -> (0.487+1.066+0.670+0.670)/4 = 2.893/4 = 0.72325\n        hour5: (0.701, 1.340, 0.548, 0.548) -> (0.701+1.340+0.548+0.548)/4 = 3.137/4 = 0.78425\n        hour6: (0.670, 1.279, 0.701, 0.670) -> (0.670+1.279+0.701+0.670)/4 = 3.32/4 = 0.830\n        hour7: (0.670, 1.432, 0.792, 0.761) -> (0.670+1.432+0.792+0.761)/4 = 3.655/4 = 0.91375\n        hour8: (1.036, 1.218, 0.853, 1.097) -> (1.036+1.218+0.853+1.097)/4 = 4.204/4 = 1.051\n        hour9: (1.066, 1.157, 1.249, 1.340) -> (1.066+1.157+1.249+1.340)/4 = 4.812/4 = 1.203\n        hour10: (0.975, 1.188, 1.310, 1.157) -> (0.975+1.188+1.310+1.157)/4 = 4.63/4 = 1.1575\n        hour11: (0.883, 0.914, 1.066, 1.097) -> (0.883+0.914+1.066+1.097)/4 = 3.96/4 = 0.99\n        hour12: (0.944, 0.975, 0.822, 1.097) -> (0.944+0.975+0.822+1.097)/4 = 3.838/4 = 0.9595\n        hour13: (1.036, 0.914, 1.218, 1.188) -> (1.036+0.914+1.218+1.188)/4 = 4.356/4 = 1.089\n        hour14: (0.853, 0.914, 1.432, 1.127) -> (0.853+0.914+1.432+1.127)/4 = 4.326/4 = 1.0815\n        hour15: (0.792, 0.914, 1.523, 0.975) -> (0.792+0.914+1.523+0.975)/4 = 4.204/4 = 1.051\n        hour16: (0.670, 0.853, 1.157, 1.066) -> (0.670+0.853+1.157+1.066)/4 = 3.746/4 = 0.9365\n        hour17: (0.822, 0.761, 1.097, 0.822) -> (0.822+0.761+1.097+0.822)/4 = 3.502/4 = 0.8755\n        hour18: (0.609, 0.792, 0.822, 0.701) -> (0.609+0.792+0.822+0.701)/4 = 2.924/4 = 0.731\n        hour19: (0.579, 0.822, 0.640, 0.670) -> (0.579+0.822+0.640+0.670)/4 = 2.711/4 = 0.67775\n        hour20: (0.609, 0.609, 0.640, 0.640) -> (0.609+0.609+0.640+0.640)/4 = 2.498/4 = 0.6245\n        hour21: (0.548, 0.579, 0.640, 0.609) -> (0.548+0.579+0.640+0.609)/4 = 2.376/4 = 0.594\n        hour22: (0.548, 0.548, 0.640, 0.609) -> (0.548+0.548+0.640+0.609)/4 = 2.345/4 = 0.58625\n        hour23: (0.609, 0.579, 0.640, 0.670) -> (0.609+0.579+0.640+0.670)/4 = 2.498/4 = 0.6245\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-12-20 (Tuesday): \n            00:00:00 -> 0.7235\n            01:00:00 -> 0.6775\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.6245\n\n        Day 2: 2016-12-21 (Wednesday): same as above\n        Day 3: 2016-12-22 (Thursday): same as above\n        Day 4: 2016-12-23 (Friday): same as above\n\n   This will give 96 values.\n\n   However, note that the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\" and the values are between about 0.45 and 1.5.
