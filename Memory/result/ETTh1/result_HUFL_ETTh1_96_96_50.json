        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, the provided sample for the past 96 points is complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same format.\n\n 4. We must be cautious: the data shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs) and also a potential weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern might not be evident.\n\n 5. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the small data (only 96 points) and the need for 96 points ahead, we might use a model that can capture seasonality. The data has an hourly frequency, so we can consider a seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n 6. We are to output the next 96 dates and the forecasted HUFL values.\n\n 7. Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, but in the provided segment there are none, we assume the provided segment is complete. However, for forecasting, we can use a method that handles missing values, but we don't have any in the input. We'll proceed with the given data.\n\n 8. We choose a model: We can use a seasonal model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters). However, with only 4 days, the seasonality might be hard to capture. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality? But the data clearly has daily cycles.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 96 points (which is a lot relative to the 96 we have), we might use a naive seasonal method or a more robust method like Prophet or LSTM? But as an expert, we must choose a method that is feasible in this context.\n\n 10. However, note that we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We are not asked for the method, just the data.\n\n 11. Since the problem does not specify the method, we can use a simple approach: \n     - We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust for the overall level.\n\n 12. But note: the last day (2017-01-20) has a very different pattern: it starts with a drop to negative values and then a rise. This might be due to a special event? We must be cautious.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a rolling forecast method. However, we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 14. We decide to use a seasonal naive method: \n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days. \n     - However, the last day is very different. We might use the last day as the pattern for the next days? But that might be too extreme.\n\n 15. Another idea: use the average of the last two days? But we have 4 days.\n\n 16. We note that the data from 2017-01-20 is the most recent and might be the most relevant. But we also see that the pattern on 2017-01-20 is unusual (with negative values). \n\n 17. We must also note that the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided segment there are none. So we are to forecast without having to impute in the given data.\n\n 18. We decide to use a weighted average where the most recent day has the highest weight. For each hour h (0 to 23), we compute:\n        forecast_h = (w1 * day1_h + w2 * day2_h + w3 * day3_h + w4 * day4_h) / (w1+w2+w3+w4)\n     Weights: we can set w4 (the last day) to 4, w3=3, w2=2, w1=1.\n\n 19. Then the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same pattern? But that would be 4 days of the same pattern. However, we are to forecast 4 days, so we can repeat the computed pattern for 4 days.\n\n 20. But note: the pattern might change? We don't have a trend. We can also consider the overall level. However, we are only use the daily pattern.\n\n 21. Steps for the method:\n     a) Extract the 4 days: \n        day1: 2017-01-17 (index 0 to 23)\n        day2: 2017-01-18 (index 24 to 47)\n        day3: 2017-01-19 (index 48 to 71)\n        day4: 2017-01-20 (index 72 to 95)\n\n     b) For each hour h (0 to 23):\n        value = (1 * day1[h] + 2 * day2[h] + 3 * day3[h] + 4 * day4[h]) / (1+2+3+4) = (day1[h] + 2*day2[h] + 3*day3[h] + 4*day4[h]) / 10\n\n     c) Then the next 96 hours (4 days) will be 4 repetitions of this 24-hour pattern.\n\n 22. However, we must generate the dates. The last date in the input is 2017-01-20 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 23. Let's compute the pattern:\n\n        hour0: (11.119*1 + 11.387*2 + 11.253*3 + 10.516*4) / 10 = (11.119 + 22.774 + 33.759 + 42.064) /10 = 109.716/10 = 10.9716\n        hour1: (11.387*1 + 10.114*2 + 12.793*3 + 9.109*4) /10 = (11.387 + 20.228 + 38.379 + 36.436) /10 = 106.43/10 = 10.643\n        ... and so on.\n\n 24. But note: the last day (2017-01-20) has a very different pattern (with negative values in the middle). This method will smooth that out? But we are giving more weight to the last day.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the last day as the pattern? Then the next 4 days would be the same as 2017-01-20? But that day had a drop to negative values. Is that expected to repeat? Probably not.\n\n 26. Considering the requirement for a complete answer and the simplicity, we go with the weighted average method.\n\n 27. We compute the 24-hour pattern:\n\n        Let day1 = [11.119, 11.387, 9.444, ...] (24 values)\n        day2 = [11.387, 10.114, ...] \n        day3 = [11.253, 12.793, ...]\n        day4 = [10.516, 9.109, ...]\n\n        pattern = [ (day1[0] + 2*day2[0] + 3*day3[0] + 4*day4[0])/10, \n                    (day1[1] + 2*day2[1] + 3*day3[1] + 4*day4[1])/10,\n                    ... ]\n\n 28. Then the next 96 hours: \n        Day1 (2017-01-21): pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n        Day2 (2017-01-22): pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n        Day3 (2017-01-23): pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n        Day4 (2017-01-24): pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n\n 29. However, we must note that the last day (2017-01-20) had a drop that might be an anomaly. But without more data, we use the available.\n\n 30. We compute the pattern:\n\n        We'll calculate the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (11.119*1 + 11.387*2 + 11.253*3 + 10.516*4) / 10 = (11.119 + 22.774 + 33.759 + 42.064) /10 = 109.716/10 = 10.9716\n        hour1: (11.387*1 + 10.114*2 + 12.793*3 + 9.109*4) /10 = (11.387 + 20.228 + 38.379 + 36.436) /10 = 106.43/10 = 10.643\n        hour2: (9.444*1 + 8.774*2 + 10.650*3 + 8.306*4) /10 = (9.444 + 17.548 + 31.95 + 33.224) /10 = 92.166/10 = 9.2166\n        hour3: (11.788*1 + 9.109*2 + 11.119*3 + 8.105*4) /10 = (11.788 + 18.218 + 33.357 + 32.42) /10 = 95.783/10 = 9.5783\n        hour4: (10.382*1 + 10.047*2 + 10.382*3 + 8.707*4) /10 = (10.382 + 20.094 + 31.146 + 34.828) /10 = 96.45/10 = 9.645\n        hour5: (10.918*1 + 9.846*2 + 11.253*3 + 8.439*4) /10 = (10.918 + 19.692 + 33.759 + 33.756) /10 = 98.125/10 = 9.8125\n        hour6: (11.253*1 + 9.243*2 + 11.588*3 + 8.172*4) /10 = (11.253 + 18.486 + 34.764 + 32.688) /10 = 97.191/10 = 9.7191\n        hour7: (14.602*1 + 11.855*2 + 11.788*3 + 9.511*4) /10 = (14.602 + 23.71 + 35.364 + 38.044) /10 = 111.72/10 = 11.172\n        hour8: (14.535*1 + 13.061*2 + 13.597*3 + 11.788*4) /10 = (14.535 + 26.122 + 40.791 + 47.152) /10 = 128.6/10 = 12.86\n        hour9: (14.066*1 + 10.315*2 + 12.458*3 + 3.550*4) /10 = (14.066 + 20.63 + 37.374 + 14.2) /10 = 86.27/10 = 8.627\n        hour10: (9.444*1 + 10.583*2 + 9.377*3 + 0.000*4) /10 = (9.444 + 21.166 + 28.131 + 0) /10 = 58.741/10 = 5.8741\n        hour11: (10.382*1 + 11.588*2 + 10.717*3 + -2.009*4) /10 = (10.382 + 23.176 + 32.151 - 8.036) /10 = 57.673/10 = 5.7673\n        hour12: (8.975*1 + 10.516*2 + 8.975*3 + -4.555*4) /10 = (8.975 + 21.032 + 26.925 - 18.22) /10 = 38.712/10 = 3.8712\n        hour13: (8.172*1 + 10.516*2 + 8.239*3 + -4.220*4) /10 = (8.172 + 21.032 + 24.717 - 16.88) /10 = 37.041/10 = 3.7041\n        hour14: (8.372*1 + 10.717*2 + 9.779*3 + -3.282*4) /10 = (8.372 + 21.434 + 29.337 - 13.128) /10 = 46.015/10 = 4.6015\n        hour15: (8.306*1 + 10.181*2 + 10.650*3 + -1.005*4) /10 = (8.306 + 20.362 + 31.95 - 4.02) /10 = 56.598/10 = 5.6598\n        hour16: (9.042*1 + 10.650*2 + 11.454*3 + 4.823*4) /10 = (9.042 + 21.3 + 34.362 + 19.292) /10 = 83.996/10 = 8.3996\n        hour17: (11.186*1 + 12.592*2 + 11.855*3 + 9.779*4) /10 = (11.186 + 25.184 + 35.565 + 39.116) /10 = 111.051/10 = 11.1051\n        hour18: (11.186*1 + 12.324*2 + 11.721*3 + 11.922*4) /10 = (11.186 + 24.648 + 35.163 + 47.688) /10 = 118.685/10 = 11.8685\n        hour19: (12.592*1 + 12.793*2 + 13.329*3 + 15.204*4) /10 = (12.592 + 25.586 + 39.987 + 60.816) /10 = 138.981/10 = 13.8981\n        hour20: (12.726*1 + 12.860*2 + 13.664*3 + 15.606*4) /10 = (12.726 + 25.72 + 40.992 + 62.424) /10 = 141.862/10 = 14.1862\n        hour21: (11.788*1 + 12.257*2 + 13.061*3 + 14.669*4) /10 = (11.788 + 24.514 + 39.183 + 58.676) /10 = 134.161/10 = 13.4161\n        hour22: (11.721*1 + 12.860*2 + 11.387*3 + 15.874*4) /10 = (11.721 + 25.72 + 34.161 + 63.496) /10 = 135.098/10 = 13.5098\n        hour23: (10.717*1 + 11.855*2 + 10.583*3 + 13.597*4) /10 = (10.717 + 23.71 + 31.749 + 54.388) /10 = 120.564/10 = 12.0564\n\n 31. Now, we have the 24-hour pattern. We will repeat this pattern 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n 32. The next 96 dates: starting from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 33. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL', with the date in the format as given.\n\n 34. We must round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places. We round our computed values to 3 decimals.\n\n 35. Let's create the data:\n\n        date: 2017-01-21 00:00:00 -> HUFL: 10.972 (rounded from 10.9716)\n        date: 2017-01-21 01:00:00 -> HUFL: 10.643\n        ... and so on.\n\n 36. We note: the pattern we computed is for 24 hours. We repeat the same pattern for 2017-01-21, 2017-01-22, 2017-01-23, 2017-01-24.\n\n 37. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 38. We write the complete 96 rows.\n\n 39. We must be cautious: the last date in the input is 2017-01-20 23:00:00, so the next date is 2017-01-21 00:00:00.\n\n 40. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 1, 20, 23, 0, 0)  # last point\n        Then the next point is start_date + timedelta(hours=1) = 2017-01-21 00:00:00\n\n        We need 96 points: so we can generate 96 dates by adding 1 hour each time.\n\n 41. But we have the pattern, so we can just write the dates for the next 4 days.\n\n 42. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-21 00:00:00 10.972\n2017-01-21 01:00:00 10.643\n2017-01-21 02:00:00 9.217\n2017-01-21 03:00:00 9.578\n2017-01-21 04:00:00 9.645\n2017-01-21 05:00:00 9.813\n2017-01-21 06:00:00 9.719\n2017-01-21 07:00:00 11.172\n2017-01-21 08:00:00 12.860\n2017-01-21 09:00:00 8.627\n2017-01-21 10:00:00 5.874\n2017-01-21 11:00:00 5.767\n2017-01-21 12:00:00 3.871\n2017-01-21 13:00:00 3.704\n2017-01-21 14:00:00 4.602\n2017-01-21 15:00:00 5.660\n2017-01-21 16:00:00 8.400\n2017-01-21 17:00:00 11.105\n2017-01-21 18:00:00 11.869\n2017-01-21 19:00:00 13.898\n2017-01-21 20:00:00 14.186\n2017-01-21 21:00:00 13.416\n2017-01-21 22:00:00 13.510\n2017-01-21 23:00:00 12.056\n2017-01-22 00:00:00 10.972\n2017-01-22 01:00:00 10.643\n... (repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days)\n\n 43. We note: the pattern is repeated exactly for each day.\n\n 44. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 45. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 46. However, note that the pattern we have for hour0 was 10.9716 -> rounded to 10.972, but the input only had 3 decimals. We do the same for all.\n\n 47. We must be cautious: the pattern for hour10: 5.8741 -> 5.874, hour11: 5.7673 -> 5.767, etc.\n\n 48. We output the data in the exact format.\n\n 49. We note: the input had negative values? So we output negative if the computed value is negative? But in our pattern, we have negative only in the middle of the day? Actually, in our pattern we have positive for all? Because we averaged the last day (which had negatives) with the previous days (which were positive). So the negatives were averaged out? That might be acceptable.\n\n 50. We proceed.\n\n 51. We generate the next 96 dates:\n\n        dates = []\n        start = datetime(2017, 1, 21, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n 52. Then we assign the pattern: \n        pattern = [10.972, 10.643, 9.217, 9.578, 9.645, 9.813, 9.719, 11.172, 12.860, 8.627, 5.874, 5.767, 3.871, 3.704, 4.602, 5.660, 8.400, 11.105, 11.869, 13.898, 14.186, 13.416, 13.510, 12.056]\n\n        Then the HUFL for the first 24 hours: pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n        next 24: same pattern, and so on.\n\n 53. We write the data.\n\n 54. We note: the pattern we computed is:\n\n        hour0: 10.9716 -> 10.972\n        hour1: 10.643 -> 10.643\n        ... we did the calculation above and rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 55. We output the entire 96 rows.\n\n 56. We must be cautious: the rounding might cause slight changes. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n 57. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 58. We note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 59. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 60. We note: the pattern we computed for the 24 hours:\n\n        [10.972, 10.643, 9.217, 9.578, 9.645, 9.813, 9.719, 11.172, 12.860, 8.627, 5.874, 5.767, 3.871, 3.704, 4.602, 5.660, 8.400, 11.105, 11.869, 13.898, 14.186, 13.416, 13.510, 12.056]\n\n 61. We repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n 62.

We note: the pattern is repeated exactly for 4 days.\n\n 66. We have 24*4 = 96 points.\n\n 67. We output the data.\n\n 68. We note: the method is simple and might not capture the potential non-stationarity or the anomaly in the last day, but with the given data and the requirement, we provide this.\n\n 69. We hope it is acceptable.\n\n 70. We note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are not given any in the input. We have used the provided data without missing values.\n\n 71.
