        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The data ranges from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that during the night the load is more negative (heavier load?) and during the day it becomes less negative (lighter load?).\n\n 2. We must handle the possibility of missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, for forecasting, we will use a method that can handle missing data if present.\n\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method that can capture seasonality. Given the hourly data and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 4. Since we are only given 96 points (which is relatively small) and we need to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, note that the data is for only 4 days, so the seasonality pattern might not be very stable.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual, then forecast each component. But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n 6. Another idea: use the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days to form a daily profile, and then use that to forecast the next 4 days. This is a naive seasonal method.\n\n    Steps for the naive seasonal method:\n    - Group by hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the average for that hour across the 4 days.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this daily profile.\n\n 7. However, we note that there might be a slight trend or change in the pattern. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We can also consider a moving average to smooth the noise.\n\n 8. Let's try to compute the hourly averages:\n\n    Hour 00: (-0.609, -0.640, -0.548, -0.487) -> average = (-0.609 -0.640 -0.548 -0.487)/4 = -0.571\n    But wait, we have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days of data: 14,15,16,17 June.\n\n    However, let's check the data starts at 2017-06-14 00:00) and ends at 2017-06-17 23:00. That is exactly 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 9. We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n    Example:\n        Hour 0: [2017-06-14 00:00:00, 2017-06-15 00:00:00, 2017-06-16 00:00:00, 2017-06-17 00:00:00] -> [-0.609, -0.640, -0.548, -0.487] -> average = (-0.609 -0.640 -0.548 -0.487)/4 = -0.571\n        Hour 1: [-0.640, -0.579, -0.518, -0.640] -> (-0.640 -0.579 -0.518 -0.640)/4 = -0.59425\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n10. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-06-18 to 2017-06-21) will be the same daily profile repeated 4 days.\n\n11. However, we must note that the data might have a trend. Let's check the overall level:\n\n    Day 1 (14th): average = (-0.609 -0.640 ... -0.640) [24 values] -> let's compute quickly: \n    But without computing all, we can see that the values are negative and the pattern is similar each day.\n\n12. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. Since we are in a constrained environment and the data is small, we can use the `statsmodels` library for SARIMA. However, note that the problem does not specify the tool, and we are to provide the data.\n\n13. But the instruction says we are an expert and we must provide the data. We are not running code, so we have to use a simple method.\n\n14. Given the above, I choose the naive seasonal method: using the hourly averages of the 4 days to form the daily pattern and then repeat for 4 days.\n\n15. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n    Let me compute the hourly averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (-0.609, -0.640, -0.548, -0.487) -> (-0.609 -0.640 -0.548 -0.487) / 4 = -0.571\n    Hour 1: (-0.640, -0.579, -0.518, -0.640) -> (-0.640 -0.579 -0.518 -0.640) / 4 = -0.59425\n    Hour 2: (-0.701, -0.609, -0.487, -0.701) -> (-0.701 -0.609 -0.487 -0.701) /4 = -0.6245\n    Hour 3: (-0.670, -0.609, -0.548, -0.609) -> (-0.670 -0.609 -0.548 -0.609) /4 = -0.609\n    Hour 4: (-0.731, -0.670, -0.487, -0.609) -> (-0.731 -0.670 -0.487 -0.609) /4 = -0.62425\n    Hour 5: (-0.579, -0.701, -0.426, -0.487) -> (-0.579 -0.701 -0.426 -0.487) /4 = -0.54825\n    Hour 6: (-0.579, -0.487, -0.366, -0.244) -> (-0.579 -0.487 -0.366 -0.244) /4 = -0.419\n    Hour 7: (-0.396, -0.366, -0.183, -0.030) -> (-0.396 -0.366 -0.183 -0.030) /4 = -0.24375\n    Hour 8: (-0.305, -0.335, -0.213,  0.000) -> (-0.305 -0.335 -0.213 +0.000) /4 = -0.21325\n    Hour 9: (-0.457, -0.213, -0.213,  0.000) -> (-0.457 -0.213 -0.213 +0.000) /4 = -0.22075\n    Hour 10: (-0.426, -0.335, -0.335, -0.061) -> (-0.426 -0.335 -0.335 -0.061) /4 = -0.28925\n    Hour 11: (-0.396, -0.396, -0.305, -0.030) -> (-0.396 -0.396 -0.305 -0.030) /4 = -0.28175\n    Hour 12: (-0.518, -0.396, -0.335, -0.305) -> (-0.518 -0.396 -0.335 -0.305) /4 = -0.3885\n    Hour 13: (-0.457, -0.457, -0.335, -0.305) -> (-0.457 -0.457 -0.335 -0.305) /4 = -0.3885\n    Hour 14: (-0.274, -0.305, -0.244, -0.244) -> (-0.274 -0.305 -0.244 -0.244) /4 = -0.26675\n    Hour 15: (-0.213, -0.457, -0.457, -0.426) -> (-0.213 -0.457 -0.457 -0.426) /4 = -0.38825\n    Hour 16: (-0.487, -0.426, -0.396, -0.213) -> (-0.487 -0.426 -0.396 -0.213) /4 = -0.3805\n    Hour 17: (-0.396, -0.487, -0.548, -0.426) -> (-0.396 -0.487 -0.548 -0.426) /4 = -0.46425\n    Hour 18: (-0.396, -0.548, -0.396, -0.426) -> (-0.396 -0.548 -0.396 -0.426) /4 = -0.4415\n    Hour 19: (-0.609, -0.457, -0.335, -0.457) -> (-0.609 -0.457 -0.335 -0.457) /4 = -0.4645\n    Hour 20: (-0.518, -0.426, -0.396, -0.335) -> (-0.518 -0.426 -0.396 -0.335) /4 = -0.41875\n    Hour 21: (-0.579, -0.518, -0.305, -0.426) -> (-0.579 -0.518 -0.305 -0.426) /4 = -0.457\n    Hour 22: (-0.609, -0.548, -0.579, -0.396) -> (-0.609 -0.548 -0.579 -0.396) /4 = -0.533\n    Hour 23: (-0.640, -0.457, -0.426, -0.366) -> (-0.640 -0.457 -0.426 -0.366) /4 = -0.47225\n\n16. Now, we will use these 24 hourly averages to form the next 4 days (96 hours). The next day starts at 2017-06-18 00:00:00.\n\n    So:\n        2017-06-18 00:00:00 -> hour0: -0.571\n        2017-06-18 01:00:00 -> hour1: -0.59425\n        ... until 2017-06-18 23:00:00 -> hour23: -0.47225\n\n    Then 2017-06-19 00:00:00 -> hour0: -0.571\n    and so on.\n\n17. We must format the dates correctly. The next 96 hours:\n\n    Start: 2017-06-18 00:00:00\n    End: 2017-06-21 23:00:00\n\n18. We write the data in the required format.\n\n19. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Let's recalculate and round:\n\n    Hour0: -0.571 -> -0.571\n    Hour1: -0.59425 -> -0.594\n    Hour2: -0.6245 -> -0.625\n    because: (-0.701 -0.609 -0.487 -0.701) = -2.498 -> -2.498/4 = -0.6245 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.625\n    But note: the original data has 3 decimal places, so we round to 3.\n\n    We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Recompute and round:\n\n    Hour0: (-0.609, -0.640, -0.548, -0.487) = -2.284 -> -2.284/4 = -0.571 -> -0.571\n    Hour1: (-0.640, -0.579, -0.518, -0.640) = -2.377 -> -2.377/4 = -0.59425 -> -0.594\n    Hour2: (-0.701, -0.609, -0.487, -0.701) = -2.498 -> -2.498/4 = -0.6245 -> -0.625\n    Hour3: (-0.670, -0.609, -0.548, -0.609) = -2.436 -> -2.436/4 = -0.609 -> -0.609\n    Hour4: (-0.731, -0.670, -0.487, -0.609) = -2.497 -> -2.497/4 = -0.62425 -> -0.624\n    Hour5: (-0.579, -0.701, -0.426, -0.487) = -2.193 -> -2.193/4 = -0.54825 -> -0.548\n    Hour6: (-0.579, -0.487, -0.366, -0.244) = -1.676 -> -1.676/4 = -0.419 -> -0.419\n    Hour7: (-0.396, -0.366, -0.183, -0.030) = -0.975 -> -0.975/4 = -0.24375 -> -0.244\n    Hour8: (-0.305, -0.335, -0.213, 0.000) = -0.853 -> -0.853/4 = -0.21325 -> -0.213\n    Hour9: (-0.457, -0.213, -0.213, 0.000) = -0.883 -> -0.883/4 = -0.22075 -> -0.221\n    Hour10: (-0.426, -0.335, -0.335, -0.061) = -1.157 -> -1.157/4 = -0.28925 -> -0.289\n    Hour11: (-0.396, -0.396, -0.305, -0.030) = -1.127 -> -1.127/4 = -0.28175 -> -0.282\n    Hour12: (-0.518, -0.396, -0.335, -0.305) = -1.554 -> -1.554/4 = -0.3885 -> -0.389\n    Hour13: (-0.457, -0.457, -0.335, -0.305) = -1.554 -> -1.554/4 = -0.3885 -> -0.389\n    Hour14: (-0.274, -0.305, -0.244, -0.244) = -1.067 -> -1.067/4 = -0.26675 -> -0.267\n    Hour15: (-0.213, -0.457, -0.457, -0.426) = -1.553 -> -1.553/4 = -0.38825 -> -0.388\n    Hour16: (-0.487, -0.426, -0.396, -0.213) = -1.522 -> -1.522/4 = -0.3805 -> -0.381\n    Hour17: (-0.396, -0.487, -0.548, -0.426) = -1.857 -> -1.857/4 = -0.46425 -> -0.464\n    Hour18: (-0.396, -0.548, -0.396, -0.426) = -1.766 -> -1.766/4 = -0.4415 -> -0.442\n    Hour19: (-0.609, -0.457, -0.335, -0.457) = -1.858 -> -1.858/4 = -0.4645 -> -0.465\n    Hour20: (-0.518, -0.426, -0.396, -0.335) = -1.675 -> -1.675/4 = -0.41875 -> -0.419\n    Hour21: (-0.579, -0.518, -0.305, -0.426) = -1.828 -> -1.828/4 = -0.457 -> -0.457\n    Hour22: (-0.609, -0.548, -0.579, -0.396) = -2.132 -> -2.132/4 = -0.533 -> -0.533\n    Hour23: (-0.640, -0.457, -0.426, -0.366) = -1.889 -> -1.889/4 = -0.47225 -> -0.472\n\n20. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-06-18\n        00:00:00 -> -0.571\n        01:00:00 -> -0.594\n        02:00:00 -> -0.625\n        03:00:00 -> -0.609\n        04:00:00 -> -0.624\n        05:00:00 -> -0.548\n        06:00:00 -> -0.419\n        07:00:00 -> -0.244\n        08:00:00 -> -0.213\n        09:00:00 -> -0.221\n        10:00:00 -> -0.289\n        11:00:00 -> -0.282\n        12:00:00 -> -0.389\n        13:00:00 -> -0.389\n        14:00:00 -> -0.267\n        15:00:00 -> -0.388\n        16:00:00 -> -0.381\n        17:00:00 -> -0.464\n        18:00:00 -> -0.442\n        19:00:00 -> -0.465\n        20:00:00 -> -0.419\n        21:00:00 -> -0.457\n        22:00:00 -> -0.533\n        23:00:00 -> -0.472\n\n    Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n21. We write the data in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple method and may not capture any trend or changing seasonality, but with only 4 days of data, it is a reasonable approach.\n\nLet's generate the full 96 records.\n",
