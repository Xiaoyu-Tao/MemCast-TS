        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00) for the \"LUFL\" (Low UseFul Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can observe that the load is higher during the night (00:00 to 05:00) and then again in the evening? \n    But looking at the data, it's not entirely consistent. However, we can see that the values at the same hour of the day are somewhat similar.\n\n 2. Since we are only given 4 days (96 hourly points) and we are to forecast the next 4 days (96 points), we can use a simple method that captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 3. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n    However, we are to be aware of the possibility. Since the provided data is complete, we proceed.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal naive method: using the last available cycle (i.e., the previous day) to forecast the next day. However, we have 4 days of history and we are to forecast 4 days.\n\n    But note: the data does not look exactly the same every day. We see that the first day (2016-07-17) and the third day (2016-07-19) have lower values, while the second and fourth days (2016-07-18 and 2016-07-20) have higher values at the beginning (00:00-07:00) and then similar pattern.\n\n    Alternatively, we can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days? But 4 days is very few.\n\n    However, note the user says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days? Actually, the user says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", which is 4 days of hourly data.\n\n 5. Considering the requirement for 96 points and the short history, we can use the following method:\n    - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 available days, and then use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to see weekly. We only have 4 consecutive days. They are from Monday? Actually, 2016-07-17 is a Sunday, 18 Monday, 19 Tuesday, 20 Wednesday.\n\n    Since we are forecasting the next 4 days (from 2016-07-21 to 2016-07-24? Actually, the last point is 2016-07-20 23:00:00, so next 96 hours would be from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00), which are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n    We don't have the same days of the week in the history? We have Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. And we are forecasting Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n    We might need to adjust for the day of the week? But with only 4 days of history, we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. This will smooth out the daily pattern and ignore the weekly effect.\n\n    Steps for forecasting:\n      - For hour h (0 to 23), let the historical values for that hour from the 4 days be: [v0, v1, v2, v3]\n      - Then the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days will be: average = (v0+v1+v2+v3)/4\n\n    However, note that the data does not have a consistent pattern. For example, at 00:00:\n        Day1: 1.919\n        Day2: 4.569\n        Day3: 2.315\n        Day4: 4.569\n        Average = (1.919+4.569+2.315+4.569)/4 = 13.372/4 = 3.343\n\n    But we see that the first and third day are lower and the second and fourth are higher. The average might be a reasonable compromise.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we could use the last day (2016-07-20) as the pattern for the next day? But the next day is Thursday and the last day is Wednesday, and we don't know if they are similar.\n\n 8. Given the ambiguity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we choose the average method.\n\n 9. How to handle the dates?\n    The last timestamp in the data is 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n    The next 96 hours would be:\n        2016-07-21 00:00:00, 2016-07-21 01:00:00, ... , 2016-07-21 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n        then 2016-07-22 00:00:00 to 2016-07-22 23:00:00 (next 24)\n        then 2016-07-23 and 2016-07-24.\n\n 10. We will generate 96 timestamps starting from 2016-07-21 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n\n 11. For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days we have.\n\n     Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1 (2016-07-17): 1.919\n        Day2 (2016-07-18): 4.569\n        Day3 (2016-07-19): 2.315\n        Day4 (2016-07-20): 4.569\n        Average = (1.919 + 4.569 + 2.315 + 4.569) / 4 = 13.372 / 4 = 3.343\n\n     Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.828\n        Day2: 4.356\n        Day3: 1.828\n        Day4: 4.295\n        Average = (1.828+4.356+1.828+4.295)/4 = 12.307/4 = 3.07675 -> rounded to 3.077\n\n     We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 12. Then, for the forecast period, each day we assign the 24 average values for the corresponding hours.\n\n     So for 2016-07-21 00:00:00: 3.343\n        2016-07-21 01:00:00: 3.077\n        ... until 2016-07-21 23:00:00: [average for hour 23]\n\n     Then for 2016-07-22 00:00:00: again 3.343 (same as the 00:00 average)\n        2016-07-22 01:00:00: 3.077\n        and so on.\n\n 13. We do this for 4 days, so 4 * 24 = 96 points.\n\n 14. We must note: the data provided does not have any missing values, so we don't have to handle missing data in the history. But if there were, we would have to impute. \n     However, the user said \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we proceed.\n\n 15. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n 16. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     hour0: (1.919 + 4.569 + 2.315 + 4.569) / 4 = 13.372 / 4 = 3.343\n     hour1: (1.828 + 4.356 + 1.828 + 4.295) / 4 = 12.307 / 4 = 3.07675 -> 3.077\n     We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n     We do for all 24 hours.\n\n 17. We'll create a list of 24 average values.\n\n 18. Then we generate the next 96 timestamps and repeat the list of 24 values 4 times.\n\n 19. Format the answer as per requirement.\n\n 20. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n      hour0: (1.919 + 4.569 + 2.315 + 4.569) = 13.372 -> 3.343\n      hour1: (1.828 + 4.356 + 1.828 + 4.295) = 12.307 -> 3.077\n      hour2: (1.736 + 4.447 + 1.828 + 4.234) = 12.245 -> 3.061\n      hour3: (1.584 + 4.325 + 1.706 + 4.142) = 11.757 -> 2.939\n      hour4: (1.553 + 4.173 + 1.706 + 4.203) = 11.635 -> 2.909\n      hour5: (1.858 + 4.417 + 1.888 + 4.447) = 12.610 -> 3.153\n      hour6: (2.437 + 4.752 + 2.254 + 4.904) = 14.347 -> 3.587\n      hour7: (2.376 + 4.904 + 2.315 + 5.026) = 14.621 -> 3.655\n      hour8: (2.345 + 2.589 + 2.619 + 2.619) = 10.172 -> 2.543\n      hour9: (2.650 + 2.376 + 2.559 + 2.802) = 10.387 -> 2.597\n      hour10: (2.894 + 2.772 + 3.107 + 2.711) = 11.484 -> 2.871\n      hour11: (3.107 + 3.229 + 3.259 + 3.503) = 13.098 -> 3.275\n      hour12: (2.406 + 2.437 + 2.254 + 2.528) = 9.625 -> 2.406\n      hour13: (2.437 + 2.345 + 2.224 + 2.802) = 9.808 -> 2.452\n      hour14: (2.193 + 2.437 + 2.041 + 2.680) = 9.351 -> 2.338\n      hour15: (2.345 + 2.833 + 1.980 + 2.711) = 9.869 -> 2.467\n      hour16: (2.224 + 2.802 + 2.741 + 2.650) = 10.417 -> 2.604\n      hour17: (2.711 + 3.015 + 2.924 + 2.985) = 11.635 -> 2.909\n      hour18: (2.711 + 3.290 + 2.711 + 2.863) = 11.575 -> 2.894\n      hour19: (2.711 + 2.833 + 2.619 + 3.046) = 11.209 -> 2.802\n      hour20: (3.381 + 3.686 + 3.320 + 4.508) = 14.895 -> 3.724\n      hour21: (3.290 + 3.564 + 3.015 + 4.173) = 14.042 -> 3.511\n      hour22: (2.528 + 2.863 + 2.345 + 3.625) = 11.361 -> 2.840\n      hour23: (2.467 + 2.437 + 2.163 + 3.046) = 10.113 -> 2.528\n\n 21. Now, we have 24 values for the hours 0 to 23:\n\n        hour0: 3.343\n        hour1: 3.077\n        hour2: 3.061\n        hour3: 2.939\n        hour4: 2.909\n        hour5: 3.153\n        hour6: 3.587\n        hour7: 3.655\n        hour8: 2.543\n        hour9: 2.597\n        hour10: 2.871\n        hour11: 3.275\n        hour12: 2.406\n        hour13: 2.452\n        hour14: 2.338\n        hour15: 2.467\n        hour16: 2.604\n        hour17: 2.909\n        hour18: 2.894\n        hour19: 2.802\n        hour20: 3.724\n        hour21: 3.511\n        hour22: 2.840\n        hour23: 2.528\n\n 22. We will use these 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 23. The next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2016-07-21 00:00:00 (which is hour0 of the first forecast day) -> 3.343\n            2016-07-21 01:00:00 -> 3.077\n            ... until 2016-07-21 23:00:00 -> 2.528\n\n      Then 2016-07-22 00:00:00 -> 3.343\n            2016-07-22 01:00:00 -> 3.077\n            ... and so on.\n\n 24. We write the data in the next 96 rows.\n\n 25. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-07-21 00:00:00 3.343\n2016-07-21 01:00:00 3.077\n... (96 lines)\n```\n\n 26. We must be careful: the dates must be consecutive and in the correct format.\n\n 27. Let's generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-07-21 00:00:00\n      Then add one hour until we have 96 points.\n\n 28. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 29. Note: We are rounding the averages to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 30. We output the data in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS value\"\n\n 31. We'll create the list of 24 values for one day:\n\n        [3.343, 3.077, 3.061, 2.939, 2.909, 3.153, 3.587, 3.655, 2.543, 2.597, 2.871, 3.275, 2.406, 2.452, 2.338, 2.467, 2.604, 2.909, 2.894, 2.802, 3.724, 3.511, 2.840, 2.528]\n\n 32. Then repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 33. Now, we write the data.\n\n 34. We note: the first forecasted date is 2016-07-21 00:00:00.\n\n 35. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        day1: 2016-07-21\n        day2: 2016-07-22\n        day3: 2016-07-23\n        day4: 2016-07-24\n\n 36. For each day, we output 24 values.\n\n 37. Code for generating the dates and values:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016, 21, 7)  # but note: the last date in the input is 2016-07-20, so next is 21st.\n\n        Actually, we can generate:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 7,21) -> but wait, the format is YYYY-MM-DD, so July 21, 2016.\n\n        However, in Python, datetime(2016, 7, 21) for July 21, 2016.\n\n        But we are writing manually.\n\n        We'll write:\n\n        2016-07-21 00:00:00 3.343\n        2016-07-21 01:00:00 3.077\n        ... \n\n 38. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 39. We output 96 lines.\n\n 40. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 41. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-07-21 00:00:00 3.343\n        2016-07-21 01:00:00 3.077\n        2016-07-21 02:00:00 3.061\n        2016-07-21 03:00:00 2.939\n        2016-07-21 04:00:00 2.909\n        2016-07-21 05:00:00 3.153\n        2016-07-21 06:00:00 3.587\n        2016-07-21 07:00:00 3.655\n        2016-07-21 08:00:00 2.543\n        2016-07-21 09:00:00 2.597\n        2016-07-21 10:00:00 2.871\n        2016-07-21 11:00:00 3.275\n        2016-07-21 12:00:00 2.406\n        2016-07-21 13:00:00 2.452\n        2016-07-21 14:00:00 2.338\n        2016-07-21 15:00:00 2.467\n        2016-07-21 16:00:00 2.604\n        2016-07-21 17:00:00 2.909\n        2016-07-21 18:00:00 2.894\n        2016-07-21 19:00:00 2.802\n        2016-07-21 20:00:00 3.724\n        2016-07-21 21:00:00 3.511\n        2016-07-21 22:00:00 2.840\n        2016-07-21 23:00:00 2.528\n\n        Then day2:\n\n        2016-07-22 00:00:00 3.343\n        2016-07-22 01:00:00 3.077\n        ... and so on.\n\n 42. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 43. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 44. We note: the last line will be 2016-07-24 23:00:00 2.528\n\n 45. We write the answer in the format.\n\n 46.
