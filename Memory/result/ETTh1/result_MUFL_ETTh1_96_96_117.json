        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (4 days) of Middle Useful Load (MUFL) from 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2017-10-16 00:00:00 to 2017-10-19 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 3. Since the data shows a clear daily seasonality (with patterns repeating every 24 hours) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might be hard to capture), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n - We'll use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality. However, with only 4 days of data, capturing weekly seasonality (168 hours) is not feasible.\n - Given the data, we can use a daily seasonality (period=24).\n - We can use models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) but note that we have negative values and the series is non-stationary.\n\n However, note that the data has some abrupt changes (like negative values on 2017-10-13) and the level shifts. This might be due to anomalies or specific events.\n\n Considering the complexity and the need for a forecast for 96 steps, we have a few options:\n\n Option 1: Use a model that can handle multiple seasonality, but we don't have enough data for weekly seasonality. So we stick to daily.\n\n Option 2: Use a simple average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But that might not capture trends.\n\n Option 3: Use a machine learning model? But with only 96 points and 96 steps ahead, it's challenging.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a seasonal naive method or a more sophisticated model like SARIMA.\n\n Let's analyze the data:\n\n - The data has a clear pattern: \n   - During the night (00:00 to 07:00) the load is relatively high and then drops during the day (especially around 09:00 to 16:00) and then rises again in the evening.\n\n However, note the negative values on 2017-10-13 and 2017-10-14. This might be due to data errors or specific events. Since we are not told to clean the data, we will use the data as is.\n\n We'll use a model that is robust to such anomalies. One candidate is the Seasonal ARIMA model.\n\n Steps for modeling:\n\n 1. Check stationarity: The series has a daily pattern (seasonal non-stationarity) and also the level changes from day to day. We might need to take seasonal differences.\n\n 2. We can try: SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[24]\n\n 3. We have to choose parameters. We can use auto_arima from pmdarima to select the best parameters? But we are not in a coding environment.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: Since we have only 4 days, we can use a naive seasonal model: \n   y_{t+96} = y_t   (using the same hour from the same day of the previous week? but we don't have a full week) -> but we only have 4 days, so we can use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days.\n\n However, note that the pattern might change. Also, the last day (2017-10-15) might be a different pattern (Sunday) and the next 4 days are from Monday to Thursday? Actually:\n\n 2017-10-12: Thursday\n 2017-10-13: Friday\n 2017-10-14: Saturday\n 2017-10-15: Sunday\n\n Then the next 4 days: \n 2017-10-16: Monday\n 2017-10-17: Tuesday\n 2017-10-18: Wednesday\n 2017-10-19: Thursday\n\n So the days of the week are different. We don't have a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in the history.\n\n Therefore, we cannot rely on the same day of the week. We can try to use the average of the same hour of the past 4 days, but note the weekend effect (Saturday and Sunday might be different from weekdays). However, we don't have a weekday (Monday to Wednesday) in the history.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last 4 days as a pattern and assume that the next 4 days will be similar? But without knowing the day of the week effect, it's hard.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we can use a simple method: \n   - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 available days (Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun) and then use that average for the next 4 days? But the next 4 days are weekdays and the weekend days are different.\n\n How about we break the 4 days into two groups: \n   - Weekdays: Thursday and Friday (2017-10-12 and 2017-10-13)\n   - Weekend: Saturday and Sunday (2017-10-14 and 2017-10-15)\n\n Then for the next 4 days:\n   - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday: we use the average of the weekdays (Thu, Fri) for the same hour? But we only have two weekdays and they are consecutive and might not represent Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n   - Thursday: we have one Thursday (2017-10-12) and then the next Thursday (2017-10-19) we can use that Thursday? But that's only one data point.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of all 4 days for each hour and then use that for the next 4 days? That might be the safest.\n\n Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (5.082 + 9.204 + 9.488 + 8.315) / 4 = (5.082+9.204+9.488+8.315)=32.089/4=8.02225\n   hour1: (4.939+9.666+9.132+8.706)/4 = (4.939+9.666+9.132+8.706)=32.443/4=8.11075\n   ... and so on.\n\n Then the forecast for:\n   2017-10-16 00:00:00 -> 8.02225\n   2017-10-16 01:00:00 -> 8.11075\n   ... and then for the next day, we use the same set of averages? Because we don't have a different pattern.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are weekdays, and the weekend days (Sat, Sun) might have a different pattern. However, we don't have enough data to separate the pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last two days (which are weekend) for the next two days? But the next two days are Monday and Tuesday, which are weekdays.\n\n Given the complexity and the lack of data, we decide to use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data has a downward trend? Let's see the last few hours of the last day (2017-10-15 23:00:00) is 8.990, and the previous days at 23:00:00: \n   2017-10-12: 8.635\n   2017-10-13: 10.199\n   2017-10-14: 8.777\n   2017-10-15: 8.990\n\n The average for hour23: (8.635+10.199+8.777+8.990)/4 = 9.15025\n\n But we don't see a clear trend. So the average might be acceptable.\n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? But the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't have to impute for the history.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n\n   We will create a list of 96 values (4 days * 24 hours) by repeating the average of each hour (computed from the 4 days) for the next 4 days.\n\n   For hour h (0<=h<=23) in the day, the average the 4 values at hour h from the 4 days.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, each day we assign the 24 averages in order.\n\n   Example for the first day (2017-10-16) and hour0: 8.02225, hour1: 8.11075, ... hour23: 9.15025.\n\n   Then the second day (2017-10-17) we use the same set of averages: hour0: 8.02225, ... \n\n   And so on for 4 days.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are weekdays and the weekend days in the history might have lower or higher values? We don't have enough data to adjust for that.\n\n We'll proceed with the average.\n\n However, let's check the data: \n   On 2017-10-13 (Friday) at 11: we have -5.153, and on 2017-10-14 (Saturday) at 11: -4.797, and on 2017-10-15 (Sunday) at 11: 1.350. \n   The Thursday (2017-10-12) at 11: 2.594.\n\n   The average for hour11: (2.594 -5.153 -4.797 + 1.350)/4 = (2.594-5.153-4.797+1.350) = -6.006/4 = -1.5015.\n\n   But is that reasonable? The next Monday at 11:00 we are forecasting -1.5015? \n\n   However, without more context, we have to go with the average.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n   Steps:\n     - Extract the hour from the datetime.\n     - Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n   The data we have 4 days, so for each hour we have 4 values.\n\n   Then we create a list of 24 means (for hour0 to hour23).\n\n   Then we repeat this list 4 times (for the 4 days).\n\n   The dates for the next 96 hours: \n        Start: 2017-10-16 00:00:00 (which is the next after 2017-10-15 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-10-16 01:00:00 ... until 2017-10-19 23:00:00.\n\n   We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   Format: \n        date, MUFL\n\n   We output 96 lines.\n\n Let's compute the averages:\n\n   We'll create a dictionary for each hour (0 to 23) and sum the values and then divide by 4.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use pandas if we were coding, but we are not. So we do it manually.\n\n   We can write a small table:\n\n   Hour 0: [5.082, 9.204, 9.488, 8.315] -> mean = (5.082+9.204+9.488+8.315)/4 = 32.089/4 = 8.02225\n   Hour 1: [4.939, 9.666, 9.132, 8.706] -> (4.939+9.666+9.132+8.706)=32.443/4=8.11075\n   Hour 2: [5.259, 9.061, 9.559, 7.533] -> (5.259+9.061+9.559+7.533)=31.412/4=7.853\n   Hour 3: [4.584, 7.889, 9.204, 8.564] -> (4.584+7.889+9.204+8.564)=30.241/4=7.56025\n   Hour 4: [5.686, 8.386, 9.132, 8.671] -> (5.686+8.386+9.132+8.671)=31.875/4=7.96875\n   Hour 5: [5.330, 10.661, 9.097, 8.528] -> (5.330+10.661+9.097+8.528)=33.616/4=8.404\n   Hour 6: [5.650, 10.554, 9.097, 8.955] -> (5.650+10.554+9.097+8.955)=34.256/4=8.564\n   Hour 7: [5.899, 10.625, 11.122, 10.270] -> (5.899+10.625+11.122+10.270)=37.916/4=9.479\n   Hour 8: [5.330, 5.330, 7.462, 5.970] -> (5.330+5.330+7.462+5.970)=24.092/4=6.023\n   Hour 9: [4.584, 1.528, 2.665, 4.868] -> (4.584+1.528+2.665+4.868)=13.645/4=3.41125\n   Hour10: [4.726, 1.492, -3.909, 4.264] -> (4.726+1.492-3.909+4.264)=6.573/4=1.64325\n   Hour11: [2.594, -5.153, -4.797, 1.350] -> (2.594-5.153-4.797+1.350)=-6.006/4=-1.5015\n   Hour12: [1.741, -4.193, -0.569, 1.528] -> (1.741-4.193-0.569+1.528)=-1.493/4=-0.37325\n   Hour13: [2.452, -7.107, 0.853, 1.457] -> (2.452-7.107+0.853+1.457)=-2.345/4=-0.58625\n   Hour14: [1.279, -3.553, 1.279, 0.391] -> (1.279-3.553+1.279+0.391)=-0.604/4=-0.151\n   Hour15: [3.305, -2.239, 1.173, 2.949] -> (3.305-2.239+1.173+2.949)=5.188/4=1.297\n   Hour16: [3.731, 1.208, 3.163, 3.411] -> (3.731+1.208+3.163+3.411)=11.513/4=2.87825\n   Hour17: [5.828, 4.584, 5.046, 4.371] -> (5.828+4.584+5.046+4.371)=19.829/4=4.95725\n   Hour18: [4.335, 4.762, 4.833, 4.371] -> (4.335+4.762+4.833+4.371)=18.301/4=4.57525\n   Hour19: [4.087, 4.584, 4.513, 4.158] -> (4.087+4.584+4.513+4.158)=17.342/4=4.3355\n   Hour20: [3.625, 4.087, 3.944, 3.731] -> (3.625+4.087+3.944+3.731)=15.387/4=3.84675\n   Hour21: [3.589, 4.335, 3.944, 3.589] -> (3.589+4.335+3.944+3.589)=15.457/4=3.86425\n   Hour22: [7.498, 8.031, 7.285, 8.280] -> (7.498+8.031+7.285+8.280)=31.094/4=7.7735\n   Hour23: [8.635, 10.199, 8.777, 8.990] -> (8.635+10.199+8.777+8.990)=36.601/4=9.15025\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n   Day1 (2017-10-16): [8.02225, 8.11075, 7.853, 7.56025, 7.96875, 8.404, 8.564, 9.479, 6.023, 3.41125, 1.64325, -1.5015, -0.37325, -0.58625, -0.151, 1.297, 2.87825, 4.95725, 4.57525, 4.3355, 3.84675, 3.86425, 7.7735, 9.15025]\n\n   Day2 (2017-10-17): same 24 numbers.\n\n   Day3 (2017-10-18): same.\n\n   Day4 (2017-10-19): same.\n\n But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 values without missing.\n\n However, we must output the dates as well.\n\n We generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-10-16 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-10-16 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-19 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list of 96 dates.\n\n   We can use:\n\n      base = datetime(2017,10,16,0,0,0)\n      then add timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)\n\n   But we are not coding, so we write them manually? That's too long.\n\n   Instead, we write a loop in the output.\n\n   But the answer format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00, 8.02225\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00, 8.11075\n        ... \n        2017-10-19 23:00:00, 9.15025\n\n   We have to output 96 lines.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-10-16\n        Day 2: 2017-10-17\n        Day 3: 2017-10-18\n        Day 4: 2017-10-19\n\n   And for each day, we output the 24 hours (00:00:00 to 23:00:00) with the corresponding average for that hour.\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n   So we round each average to 3 decimals.\n\n   Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n   Hour0: 8.02225 -> 8.022\n   Hour1: 8.11075 -> 8.111\n   Hour2: 7.853 -> 7.853\n   Hour3: 7.56025 -> 7.560\n   Hour4: 7.96875 -> 7.969\n   Hour5: 8.404 -> 8.404\n   Hour6: 8.564 -> 8.564\n   Hour7: 9.479 -> 9.479\n   Hour8: 6.023 -> 6.023\n   Hour9: 3.41125 -> 3.411\n   Hour10: 1.64325 -> 1.643\n   Hour11: -1.5015 -> -1.502\n   Hour12: -0.37325 -> -0.373\n   Hour13: -0.58625 -> -0.586\n   Hour14: -0.151 -> -0.151\n   Hour15: 1.297 -> 1.297\n   Hour16: 2.87825 -> 2.878\n   Hour17: 4.95725 -> 4.957\n   Hour18: 4.57525 -> 4.575\n   Hour19: 4.3355 -> 4.336\n   Hour20: 3.84675 -> 3.847\n   Hour21: 3.86425 -> 3.864\n   Hour22: 7.7735 -> 7.774\n   Hour23: 9.15025 -> 9.150\n\n   But note: for hour11: -1.5015 rounded to 3 decimals: \n        -1.5015 -> the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up: -1.502\n\n   Similarly, hour19: 4.3355 -> 4.336\n\n   Now, we write the output:\n\n   We have 4 days, each day has the same 24 values.\n\n   Example:\n\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00,8.022\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00,8.111\n        ...\n        2017-10-16 23:00:00,9.150\n        2017-10-17 00:00:00,8.022\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-10-16\n        Day2: 2017-10-17\n        Day3: 2017-10-18\n        Day4: 2017-10-19\n\n   And for each day, we output 24 hours.\n\n   We must be careful: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We write:\n\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00,8.022\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00,8.111\n        ... until 23:00:00\n\n   Then 2017-10-17 00:00:00,8.022\n   ... until 2017-10-19 23:00:00,9.150\n\n   Total 96 lines.\n\n   We output in the required format.\n\n   Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   We are providing 96 lines.\n\n   Let's write the first few and last few:\n\n        ...\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00,8.022\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00,8.111\n        2017-10-16 02:00:00,7.853\n        2017-10-16 03:00:00,7.560\n        2017-10-16 04:00:00,7.969\n        2017-10-16 05:00:00,8.404\n        2017-10-16 06:00:00,8.564\n        2017-10-16 07:00:00,9.479\n        2017-10-16 08:00:00,6.023\n        2017-10-16 09:00:00,3.411\n        2017-10-16 10:00:00,1.643\n        2017-10-16 11:00:00,-1.502\n        2017-10-16 12:00:00,-0.373\n        2017-10-16 13:00:00,-0.586\n        2017-10-16 14:00:00,-0.151\n        2017-10-16 15:00:00,1.297\n        2017-10-16 16:00:00,2.878\n        2017-10-16 17:00:00,4.957\n        2017-10-16 18:00:00,4.575\n        2017-10-16 19:00:00,4.336\n        2017-10-16 20:00:00,3.847\n        2017-10-16 21:00:00,3.864\n        2017-10-16 22:00:00,7.774\n        2017-10-16 23:00:00,9.150\n\n        Then for 2017-10-17: same values again.\n\n        ...\n\n        Last day: 2017-10-19 23:00:00,9.150\n\n   We output 96 lines.\n\n   We'll write the entire 96 lines in the answer.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 time points.\n\n   We are generating 96 time points.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only given one variable: MUFL. So we output only MUFL.\n\n   The format: two columns: date and MUFL.\n\n   We output without the index.\n\n   We write:\n\n        date,MUFL\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00,8.022\n        ... \n\n   But the example input had a space after the comma? Actually, the input had:\n\n        2017-10-12 00:00:00  5.082\n\n   It had two spaces? But in the example, it was aligned. We can use a comma and then the value without space? Or we can use a comma and then the value.\n\n   The problem says: \"Please obey the format strictly.\" and the example input had:\n\n        date   MUFL\n        2017-10-12 00:00:00  5.082\n\n   But in the data, it was separated by spaces? Actually, it's a fixed width? But the problem says to output in the same way? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\" and then it shows:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   And in the example input, it was a space separated? But the example input had:\n\n               date   MUFL\n        2017-10-12 00:00:00  5.082\n\n   So we can output with a space? But the problem says \"complete data\" and the format is not specified. \n\n   We'll output as: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS {space} {value}\"\n\n   And we'll use the same number of spaces as the input? The input had:\n\n        The first line: \"               date   MUFL\" -> that's a lot of spaces. But the data lines: the date string is 19 characters, then a space and then the value.\n\n   We can output:\n\n        [date string] [space] [value]\n\n   with the date string being 19 characters? Actually, the date string is fixed: \"2017-10-16 00:00:00\" is 19 characters.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        \"2017-10-16 00:00:00 8.022\"\n\n   But the input had:\n\n        \"2017-10-12 00:00:00  5.082\" -> two spaces? Actually, in the input, the first data line: \"2017-10-12 00:00:00  5.082\" -> there are two spaces between the time and the value? \n\n   Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2017-10-12 00:00:00  5.082\"\n\n   But the value 5.082 has 5 characters (including the decimal point and the minus if present). The date string is 19 characters. Then we have two spaces? \n\n   We can use one space? \n\n   The problem does not specify the exact spacing. We'll use one space.\n\n   Alternatively, we can align the values? But the problem does not require alignment.\n\n   We'll output: \n\n        [date string] [one space] [value]\n\n   Example: \"2017-10-16 00:00:00 8.022\"\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Now, we generate the 96 lines.\n\n   We have the 24 values for one day (in a list) and we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        day0: 2017-10-16\n        day1: 2017-10-17\n        day2: 2017-10-18\n        day3: 2017-10-19\n\n   For each day, we iterate from hour0 to hour23.\n\n   We write the code in our mind:\n\n        values = [8.022, 8.111, 7.853, 7.560, 7.969, 9.150]  # 24 values as above\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = \n                    if day==0: base_date = \"2017-10-16\"\n                    if day==1: base_date = \"2017-10-17\"\n                    if day==2: base_date = \"2017-10-18\"\n                    if day==3: base_date = \"2017-10-19\"\n                time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                full_date = f\"{base_date} {time_str}\"\n                value = values[hour]\n                print(f\"{full_date} {value}\")\n\n   But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   We'll do it in the answer.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete answer\", so we have to write 96 lines.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" in the provided data? But we are not given any missing value in the 96 points. So we didn't have to impute for the history. And for the forecast, we are providing complete data.\n\n   We output the 96 lines.\n\n   We write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: The problem says \"Please obey the format strictly.\" and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [first line]\n        [second line]\n        ...\n        [96th line]\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        2017-10-16 00:00:00 8.022\n        2017-10-16 01:00:00 8.111\n        2017-10-16 02:00:00 7.853\n        2017-10-16 03:00:00 7.560\n        2017-10-16 04:00:00 7.969\n        2017-10-16 05:00:00 8.404\n        2017-10-16 06:00:00 8.564\n        2017-10-16 07:00:00 9.479\n        2017-10-16 08:00:00 6.023\n        2017-10-16 09:00:00 3.411\n        2017-10-16 10:00:00 1.643\n        2017-10-16 11:00:00 -1.502\n        2017-10-16 12:00:00 -0.373\n        2017-10-16 13:00:00 -0.586\n        2017-10-16 14:00:00 -0.151\n        2017-10-16 15:00:00 1.297\n        2017-10-16 16:00:00 2.878\n        2017-10-16 17:00:00 4.957\n        2017-10-16 18:00:00 4.575\n        2017-10-16 19:00:00 4.336\n        2017-10-16 20:00:00 3.847\n        2017-10-16 21:00:00 3.864\n        2017-10-16 22:00:00 7.774\n        2017-10-16 23:00:00 9.150\n        2017-10-17 00:00:00 8.022\n        2017-10-17 01:00:00 8.111\n        2017-10-17 02:00:00 7.853\n        2017-10-17 03:00:00 7.560\n        2017-10-17 04:00:00 7.969\n        2017-10-17 05:00:00 8.404\n        2017-10-17 06:00:00 8.564\n        2017-10-17 07:00:00 9.479\n        2017-10-17 08:00:00 6.023\n        2017-10-17 09:00:00 3.411\n        2017-10-17 10:00:00 1.643\n        2017-10-17 11:00:00 -1.502\n        2017-10-17 12:00:00 -0.373\n        2017-10-17 13:00:00 -0.586\n        2017-10-17 14:00:00 -0.151\n        2017-10-17 15:00:00 1.297\n        2017-10-17 16:00:00 2.878\n        2017-10-17 17:00:00 4.957\n        2017-10-17 18:00:00 4.575\n        2017-10-17 19:00:00 4.336\n        2017-10-17 20:00:00 3.847\n        2017-10-17 21:00:00 3.864\n        2017-10-17 22:00:00 7.774\n        2017-10-17 23:00:00 9.150\n        2017-10-18 00:00:00 8.022\n        2017-10-18 01:00:00 8.111\n        2017-10-18 02:00:00 7.853\n        2017-10-18 03:00:00 7.560\n        2017-10-18 04:00:00 7.969\n        2017-10-18 05:00:00 8.404\n        2017-10-18 06:00:00 8.564\n        2017-10-18 07:00:00 9.479\n        2017-10-18 08:00:00 6.023\n        2017-10-18 09:00:00 3.411\n        2017-10-18 10:00:00 1.643\n        2017-10-18 11:00:00 -1.502\n        2017-10-18 12:00:00 -0.373\n        2017-10-18 13:00:00 -0.586\n        2017-10-18 14:00:00 -0.151\n        2017-10-18 15:00:00 1.297\n        2017-10-18 16:00:00 2.878\n        2017-10-18 17:00:00 4.957\n        2017-10-18 18:00:00 4.575\n        2017-10-18 19:00:00 4.336\n        2017-10-18 20:00:00 3.847\n        2017-10-18 21:00:00 3.864\n        2017-10-18 22:00:00 7.774\n        2017-10-18 23:00:00 9.150\n        2017-10-19 00:00:00 8.022\n        2017-10-19 01:00:00 8.111\n        2017-10-19 02:00:00 7.853\n        2017-10-19 03:00:00 7.560\n        2017-10-19 04:00:00 7.969\n        2017-10-19 05:00:00 8.404\n        2017-10-19 06:00:00 8.564\n        2017-10-19 07:00:00 9.479\n        2017-10-19 08:00:00 6.023\n        2017-10-19 09:00:00 3.411\n        2017-10-19 10:00:00 1.643\n        2017-10-19 11:00:00 -1.502\n        2017-10-19 12:00:00 -0.373\n        2017-10-19 13:00:00 -0.586\n        2017-10-19 14:00:00 -0.151\n        2017-10-19 15:00:00 1.297\n        2017-10-19 16:00:00 2.878\n        2017-10-19 17:00:00 4.957\n        2017-10-19 18:00:00 4.575\n        2017-10-19 19:00:00 4.336\n        2017-10-19 20:00:00 3.847\n        2017-10-19 21:00:00 3.864\n        2017-10-19 22:00:00 7.774\n        2017-10-19 23:00:00 9.150\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   We are done.\n\n   Note: We rounded the values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   This is a simple and reasonable forecast given the data.\n\n   We are aware that more sophisticated models could be used, but with only 4 days, it's hard to do better.\n\n   We output the 96 lines.\n\n   We hope it's acceptable.\n",
