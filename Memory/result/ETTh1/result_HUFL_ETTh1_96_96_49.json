        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also might have weekly patterns (though we only have 4 days).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But the provided 96 points are complete.\n    For forecasting, we assume the model we build can handle the pattern and we will produce 96 complete points.\n\n 3. We choose a model: Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. Since we have hourly data and seasonality of 24, \n    can use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or other methods. However, note that we have only 96 points (4 days) to train on, which is very short.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual. But with only 4 days, trend might be hard to capture.\n    - We can use the average of the same hour from the previous days and adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 5. Given the limited data, we can try:\n    - Calculate the average pattern for a day (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n    - But note: the data shows a pattern that the load drops during the day and rises at night? \n\n 6. However, we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) ahead. We can use the following approach:\n\n    a) Compute the daily average for each of the 4 days and then compute the average of the last day (or last two days) as the base level.\n    b) Then use the hourly profile (relative to the daily average) from the historical days.\n\n    But note: the data from 2017-01-13 to 2017-01-16 (4 days) might not be consecutive days of the week? \n    We don't have the day of the week, but we can assume they are consecutive.\n\n 7. Steps for a simple model:\n\n    Let H(d, h) be the HUFL on day d at hour h (h from 0 to 23).\n\n    We have 4 days: d0, d1, d2, d3 (from 2017-01-13 to 2017-01-16).\n\n    We want to forecast for d4 (2017-01-17), d5 (2017-01-18), d6 (2017-01-19), d7 (2017-01-20).\n\n    We can compute the daily average for each day:\n\n        A_d = average of H(d, h) for h in [0,23]\n\n    Then, for each hour h, we can compute the relative value: R(d, h) = H(d, h) / A_d   [or we can use additive: H(d, h) - A_d]\n\n    But note: the pattern might be additive? Let's check the variation: the values range from negative to about 15. \n    The daily average might be around 8-10? The variation within a day is about 10 units. \n\n    We can try additive decomposition.\n\n    However, we have only 4 days. We can compute the average hourly profile over the 4 days:\n\n        base_h = ( R(d0, h) + R(d1, h) + R(d2, h) + R(d3, h) ) / 4   [if additive: base_h = ( (H(d0,h)-A0) + ... ) / 4 ]\n\n    Then, to forecast for a future day d4, we need the daily average for d4. How to get that?\n\n    We can take the average of the last few days and assume a trend? But we have 4 days, so we can compute the daily averages:\n\n        A0 = average of day0 (2017-01-13) -> let's compute:\n\n        Day0: 2017-01-13: \n            values: [14.066, 13.262, 13.463, 13.329, 13.329, 12.994, 13.329, 11.922, 11.989, 8.439, 7.636, 4.622, 0.670, 1.206, 3.550, 3.081, 4.957, 8.573, 8.975, 11.253, 10.851, 9.913, 11.855, 12.726]\n            A0 = sum / 24 = 8.99 (approx)\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-14: \n            [10.583, 11.052, 10.918, 9.310, 9.377, 9.578, 10.918, 12.525, 13.597, 8.372, 4.019, 2.411, 0.201, 1.005, 2.009, 2.947, 6.162, 10.516, 10.985, 12.123, 11.788, 10.717, 11.855, 12.994]\n            A1 = 8.15 (approx)\n\n        Day2: 2017-01-15:\n            [12.391, 11.788, 11.387, 10.047, 11.320, 11.320, 12.458, 13.530, 15.204, 7.502, 3.751, 3.215, -0.268, 5.157, 2.947, 5.492, 8.038, 10.516, 10.717, 12.123, 11.989, 12.123, 12.190, 14.334]\n            A2 = 9.15 (approx)\n\n        Day3: 2017-01-16:\n            [12.659, 11.119, 12.123, 10.382, 11.052, 11.588, 12.123, 13.463, 14.669, 8.573, 4.153, 3.081, 0.737, 0.938, 1.541, 3.282, 5.693, 10.248, 10.382, 11.989, 12.257, 13.262, 12.860, 12.525]\n            A3 = 8.88 (approx)\n\n    The daily averages: [8.99, 8.15, 9.15, 8.88] -> no clear trend. We might take the average of these 4 days? or use the last day? \n    But we are forecasting 4 days ahead. We can use the average of the last 4 days as the daily average for each of the next 4 days? \n    However, that would be constant. Alternatively, we can use a moving average. Since we have only 4 days, we can use the average of the 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n    Let A_avg = (A0+A1+A2+A3)/4 = (8.99+8.15+9.15+8.88)/4 \u2248 8.79\n\n    Then for each hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we set:\n\n        Forecast(d4, h) = A_avg + base_h\n\n    where base_h is the average deviation for hour h over the 4 days.\n\n    How to compute base_h?\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): \n            d0: 14.066 - 8.99 = 5.076\n            d1: 10.583 - 8.15 = 2.433\n            d2: 12.391 - 9.15 = 3.241\n            d3: 12.659 - 8.88 = 3.779\n            base_h0 = (5.076+2.433+3.241+3.779)/4 = 3.632\n\n        Then for 2017-01-17 00:00:00: 8.79 + 3.632 = 12.422\n\n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same base_h for each day? \n\n    However, we might notice that the pattern is similar each day? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days without decomposing by daily average? \n\n        base_h0 = (14.066+10.583+12.391+12.659)/4 = 12.42475\n\n    Then we use that for the first hour of each day? But that would ignore the daily level. \n\n    We'll go with the additive decomposition.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute daily averages for the 4 days (A0, A1, A2, A3).\n        Step 2: For each hour h (0 to 23), compute the deviation for that hour in each day: \n                dev(d, h) = H(d, h) - A_d\n        Step 3: Compute the average deviation for each hour: base_h = (dev(d0,h)+dev(d1,h)+dev(d2,h)+dev(d3,h))/4\n        Step 4: The daily average for the forecast period: we use the average of the last 4 days: A_avg = (A0+A1+A2+A3)/4\n        Step 5: For each day in the forecast period (4 days) and for each hour h, \n                Forecast(d, h) = A_avg + base_h\n\n    This will give the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 8. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not encountered in the provided 96 points. \n    For the forecast, we are to produce 96 points without missing.\n\n 9. However, we must consider that the pattern might change? But with only 4 days, we cannot capture weekly seasonality (like weekend vs weekday). \n    Since the next 4 days are from 2017-01-17 (Tuesday) to 2017-01-20 (Friday) and the given data is from Friday (2017-01-13) to Monday (2017-01-16)? \n    Let me check: 2017-01-13 is Friday, 14 Saturday, 15 Sunday, 16 Monday. Then 17 Tuesday, 18 Wednesday, 19 Thursday, 20 Friday.\n\n    The given data includes a weekend day (Saturday and Sunday? and Monday). The next days are weekdays? \n\n    We might need to adjust for the day of the week? But we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only one Friday, one Saturday, one Sunday, one Monday).\n\n    Therefore, we will use the same pattern for all days.\n\n 10. Implementation:\n\n     We'll compute the daily averages for the 4 days:\n\n        Day0 (2017-01-13): A0 = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        ... similarly for A1, A2, A3.\n\n     Then compute the deviations for each hour.\n\n     Then base_h for each hour (0 to 23) = average of the deviations at that hour over the 4 days.\n\n     Then A_avg = (A0+A1+A2+A3)/4.\n\n     Then for each of the next 4 days (2017-01-17 to 2017-01-20) and for each hour in [0,23]:\n\n        Forecast(date) = A_avg + base_h\n\n 11.
