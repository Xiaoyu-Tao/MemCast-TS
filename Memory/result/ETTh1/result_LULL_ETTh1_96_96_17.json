        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days: from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with 24-hour cycles.\n 2. We also note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are no missing values for the given 96 points. However, the problem states that the data may have missing values. Since we are only given 96 complete points, we assume that for forecasting we have to handle the time series as is.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data has seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. Given the hourly data and the daily pattern, the seasonality period is 24.\n\n However, as an expert, I must choose a method that can handle the seasonality and the relatively short history (only 4 days). We can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive method: forecast each hour of the next day as the same as the same hour of the last day (or average of same hour over the past 4 days?).\n   - But note: the data shows some variation day to day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components.\n\n But note: we are only given 4 days of data (96 points) and we are to forecast 4 days (96 points). The data is very limited.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can use:\n   - A seasonal naive model: using the last day (24 points) as the forecast for the next day? But we have 4 days of history.\n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided data, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, I will use a simple and robust method: \n   - Use the average of the same hour over the available days (4 days) to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the pattern might change? However, with only 4 days, we don't have much to average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? But the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", so maybe the pattern is consistent.\n\n Let me look at the data:\n\n Day 1 (2016-09-07): \n   - Starts at 0.731, then drops to 0.609, then rises to 1.279 at 10:00, then fluctuates and drops at night.\n\n Day 2 (2016-09-08): \n   - Starts at 1.340 (which is higher) and then has a peak at 1.584 at 07:00, then drops and then a second peak at 15:00? and then drops.\n\n Day 3 (2016-09-09): \n   - Starts at 0.853, then rises to 1.218 at 09:00, then stays around 1.1-1.2 until 19:00, then drops.\n\n Day 4 (2016-09-10): \n   - Starts at 0.853, then drops to 0.701, then rises to 1.492 at 10:00, then drops and then a small peak at 19:00.\n\n The pattern is not exactly the same each day. \n\n Given the limited data, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the same hour for the last 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be a constant for each hour? \n\n However, the problem says to forecast 96 points (4 days). We can compute:\n\n   For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, the forecast for the next 4 days at that hour is the average of the same hour h from the 4 available days.\n\n But note: the data starts at 2016-09-07 (which is a Wednesday) and ends at 2016-09-10 (Saturday). The next 4 days would be Sunday (2016-09-11), Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n\n However, we don't have information about weekly seasonality because we only have 4 days. So we stick to daily seasonality.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n   Let the historical data be in a matrix of 4 days (rows) and 24 hours (columns). We have 4 days, each with 24 hours.\n\n   Then for each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day 5 (2016-09-11): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ..., avg_hour23]\n        Day 6 (2016-09-12): same as Day5\n        Day 7 (2016-09-13): same as Day5\n        Day 8 (2016-09-14): same as Day5\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and we are using the average of the past 4 days. This might be reasonable.\n\n However, let's check the data: the first day (2016-09-07) is Wednesday, then Thursday, Friday, Saturday. The next day is Sunday, which might be different? But without weekly data, we cannot account for that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the forecast for Sunday? and then the average for the rest? But that would be inconsistent.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but in the provided data there are none. So we can compute the average.\n\n However, if there were missing values, we would have to impute them. But the provided data is complete.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 00: (0.731 + 1.340 + 0.853 + 0.853) / 4 = (0.777) -> but wait, the last day (2016-09-10) at 00:00 is 0.853? Actually:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-07 00:00:00 -> 0.731\n        Day2: 2016-09-08 00:00:00 -> 1.340\n        Day3: 2016-09-09 00:00:00 -> 0.853\n        Day4: 2016-09-10 00:00:00 -> 0.853\n\n        Average = (0.731 + 1.340 + 0.853 + 0.853) / 4 = 3.777 / 4 = 0.94425\n\n   Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data for the last day (2016-09-10) ends at 23:00:00 with 0.914. So we have 4 complete days.\n\n However, the problem says the data is for the next 96 recorded dates. We must generate 96 timestamps starting from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Create a list of the 96 timestamps for the forecast period.\n\n   Step 2: For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days.\n\n   Step 3: For the first day of forecast (2016-09-11), we assign the average for hour0, hour1, ... hour23.\n            Then the same for the next 3 days.\n\n   Step 4: Format the output as per the requirement.\n\n But note: the data provided has 4 days, but the last day is 2016-09-10 (Saturday). The next day is 2016-09-11 (Sunday). We are using the average of the past 4 days (which includes a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) to forecast Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n\n However, without more data, we cannot adjust for the day of the week. So we use the same pattern for all 4 forecasted days.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and then average the 4 values.\n\n   We have the data in order. We can group by hour of the day.\n\n   We note the data:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-07: 00:00 -> index0, 01:00 -> index1, ... 23:00 -> index23\n        Day2: 2016-09-08: 00:00 -> index24 (which is hour0 of day2), ... \n        Day3: 2016-09-09: 00:00 -> index48\n        Day4: 2016-09-10: 00:00 -> index72\n\n   So for hour0 (00:00): indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n        values: 0.731, 1.340, 0.853, 0.853 -> average = (0.731+1.340+0.853+0.853)/4 = 3.777/4 = 0.94425\n\n   hour1 (01:00): indices 1, 25, 49,73\n        values: 0.731, 1.279, 0.914, 0.792 -> average = (0.731+1.279+0.914+0.792)/4 = 3.716/4 = 0.929\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-09-11): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day2 (2016-09-12): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day3 (2016-09-13): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n        Day4 (2016-09-14): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n   We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places.
