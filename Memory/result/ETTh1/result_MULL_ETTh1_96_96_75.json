        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 3. Since the data shows a time series with potential daily seasonality (24 hours in a day), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal ARIMA model or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality.\n - Alternatively, we can use a simple method if the data is not too complex. However, the data shows fluctuations and a possible daily pattern.\n\n Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need for 4 days forecast, we must be cautious.\n\n However, note: The problem states that the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't need to impute for the given data.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that can handle seasonality. Let's use a seasonal naive approach as a baseline? \n But the data does not only have seasonality but also a trend? Let's check:\n\n Looking at the data:\n   - The first two days (Apr 27 and 28) start with negative values and then on Apr 28 we see positive values in the middle of the day.\n   - Apr 29 and 30 show positive values at the beginning and then become negative at the end of Apr 30.\n\n This suggests a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (less than a week). So we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last 24 hours (or the average of the last few days) to forecast the next 24 hours? But the pattern might change.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days.\n\n However, note that the data from Apr 27 to Apr 30 (4 days) are consecutive and we are to forecast the next 4 days (May 1 to May 4).\n\n Since we don't have a long history, we can use the following:\n\n Option 1: Use the average of each hour over the available 4 days to forecast the same hour for the next 4 days? \n   But the pattern might be different on weekdays and weekends. However, 2017-04-27 is Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday.\n   Then the next 4 days: Monday (May 1), Tuesday (May 2), Wednesday (May 3), Thursday (May 4).\n\n So we have:\n   - Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday -> then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n We don't have a Monday to Thursday pattern? \n\n Option 2: We can use the same day of the previous week? But we don't have previous week data.\n\n Option 3: Use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour. But we only have 4 points per hour.\n\n Given the constraints, we can try to use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? \n However, the next 4 days are weekdays (Monday to Thursday) and the last 4 days include weekend (Saturday and Sunday). \n This might not be appropriate.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Sunday) to forecast Monday? But that might not capture the pattern.\n\n Since we are limited, we can use a model that uses the entire 96 points to forecast the next 96. We can use an ARIMA model with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24).\n\n Steps for ARIMA:\n   - We can use auto_arima from pmdarima to automatically select the parameters? But we cannot run code here.\n\n However, we are an expert and we must provide the forecast.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we can use a simple method: \n   - We will compute the average of each hour over the 4 available days and then use that average for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are weekdays and the last 4 days include two weekdays and two weekend days. So we might adjust by:\n\n   - For Monday: we only have one Monday? We don't. So we can use the average of the same hour from the two weekdays (Thursday and Friday) and then adjust by the difference between the weekend? \n   - But we don't have enough data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the pattern of the last 4 days as a whole and assume the next 4 days will be similar? \n\n Since we have no other information, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   - For hour 00:00: average of [-0.569, -1.457, 2.239, 1.848] = ( -0.569 -1.457 + 2.239 + 1.848 ) / 4 = (2.061) / 4 = 0.51525\n   - Similarly for each hour (00:00 to 23:00) we compute the average.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are 96 hours. We will repeat the same 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n However, the average pattern might be too smooth and not capture the daily variation.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-04-30) as the pattern for the next day? But that was a Sunday and the next day is Monday.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we choose the average method for each hour over the 4 days.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00):\n        Day1: -0.569\n        Day2: -1.457\n        Day3: 2.239\n        Day4: 1.848\n        Average = (-0.569 -1.457 + 2.239 + 1.848) / 4 = (2.061) / 4 = 0.51525\n\n   Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00):\n        Day1: -1.706\n        Day2: -1.564\n        Day3: 2.061\n        Day4: 1.457\n        Average = (-1.706 -1.564 + 2.061 + 1.457) / 4 = (0.248) / 4 = 0.062\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (May 1 to May 4), we assign the average value for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. And we are to forecast the next 96 without missing? \n   We are to provide the complete data for the next 96.\n\n However, the average method might not be the best, but with limited data and no ability to run complex models, it is a simple baseline.\n\n Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n Hour 0: ( -0.569 + -1.457 + 2.239 + 1.848 ) / 4 = (2.061) / 4 = 0.51525\n Hour 1: ( -1.706 + -1.564 + 2.061 + 1.457 ) / 4 = (0.248) / 4 = 0.062\n Hour 2: ( -1.066 + -1.670 + 1.492 + 1.635 ) / 4 = (0.391) / 4 = 0.09775\n Hour 3: ( -0.640 + -1.741 + 2.132 + 1.670 ) / 4 = (1.421) / 4 = 0.35525\n Hour 4: ( -1.635 + -1.457 + 1.990 + 1.599 ) / 4 = (0.497) / 4 = 0.12425\n Hour 5: ( -2.203 + -1.421 + 1.883 + 1.599 ) / 4 = (-0.142) / 4 = -0.0355\n Hour 6: ( -2.132 + -0.711 + 3.447 + 2.025 ) / 4 = (2.629) / 4 = 0.65725\n Hour 7: ( -1.564 + -1.173 + 2.025 + 1.777 ) / 4 = (1.065) / 4 = 0.26625\n Hour 8: ( -0.675 + -0.391 + 2.736 + 1.848 ) / 4 = (3.518) / 4 = 0.8795\n Hour 9: ( -0.782 + -0.569 + 1.350 + 2.701 ) / 4 = (2.7) / 4 = 0.675\n Hour 10: ( -0.320 + -0.249 + 1.954 + 3.092 ) / 4 = (4.477) / 4 = 1.11925\n Hour 11: ( -0.178 + 0.391 + 1.954 + 3.020 ) / 4 = (5.187) / 4 = 1.29675\n Hour 12: ( -1.528 + 1.208 + 0.782 + 1.635 ) / 4 = (2.097) / 4 = 0.52425\n Hour 13: ( -0.924 + 2.594 + 1.102 + 1.848 ) / 4 = (4.62) / 4 = 1.155\n Hour 14: ( -0.569 + 0.959 + 1.386 + 0.640 ) / 4 = (2.416) / 4 = 0.604\n Hour 15: ( -0.213 + 0.817 + 1.492 + 0.071 ) / 4 = (2.167) / 4 = 0.54175\n Hour 16: ( -1.421 + 0.959 + 1.173 + -0.355 ) / 4 = (0.356) / 4 = 0.089\n Hour 17: ( -1.350 + 0.604 + 1.244 + -0.497 ) / 4 = (0.001) / 4 = 0.00025\n Hour 18: ( -1.741 + 0.817 + 0.569 + -0.782 ) / 4 = (-1.137) / 4 = -0.28425\n Hour 19: ( -1.919 + 0.746 + 0.853 + -0.497 ) / 4 = (-0.817) / 4 = -0.20425\n Hour 20: ( -2.132 + 0.995 + 1.031 + -0.711 ) / 4 = (-0.817) / 4 = -0.20425\n Hour 21: ( -0.959 + 0.533 + 1.777 + -0.817 ) / 4 = (0.534) / 4 = 0.1335\n Hour 22: ( -1.635 + 0.853 + 0.426 + -0.853 ) / 4 = (-1.209) / 4 = -0.30225\n Hour 23: ( -1.386 + 2.452 + 0.959 + 0.569 ) / 4 = (2.594) / 4 = 0.6485\n\n Now, we create the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00) by repeating these 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are:\n   Day 1: 2017-05-01 (Monday) -> use the average for Monday? But we don't have Monday. So we use the overall average for each hour.\n\n   We will use:\n        May 1, 00:00: 0.51525\n        May 1, 01:00: 0.062\n        ... and so on for 24 hours of May 1.\n\n        Then May 2: same 24 numbers again.\n        May 3: same 24 numbers.\n        May 4: same 24 numbers.\n\n However, we must format the dates correctly and round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-05-01 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-05-01 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-01 23:00:00\n   Then 2017-05-02 00:00:00 ... until 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n\n We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format as the input.\n\n But note: the input data has negative values and up to 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's compute the rounded values:\n\n   Hour0: 0.51525 -> 0.515\n   Hour1: 0.062 -> 0.062\n   Hour2: 0.09775 -> 0.098\n   Hour3: 0.35525 -> 0.355\n   Hour4: 0.12425 -> 0.124\n   Hour5: -0.0355 -> -0.036\n   Hour6: 0.65725 -> 0.657\n   Hour7: 0.26625 -> 0.266\n   Hour8: 0.8795 -> 0.880\n   Hour9: 0.675 -> 0.675\n   Hour10: 1.11925 -> 1.119\n   Hour11: 1.29675 -> 1.297\n   Hour12: 0.52425 -> 0.524\n   Hour13: 1.155 -> 1.155\n   Hour14: 0.604 -> 0.604\n   Hour15: 0.54175 -> 0.542\n   Hour16: 0.089 -> 0.089\n   Hour17: 0.00025 -> 0.000\n   Hour18: -0.28425 -> -0.284\n   Hour19: -0.20425 -> -0.204\n   Hour20: -0.20425 -> -0.204\n   Hour21: 0.1335 -> 0.134\n   Hour22: -0.30225 -> -0.302\n   Hour23: 0.6485 -> 0.649\n\n Now, we create the data:\n\n   May 1, 00:00:00 -> 0.515\n   May 1, 01:00:00 -> 0.062\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll output the data in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data. So we are providing 96 records without missing.\n\n Let's write the data in the format:\n\n        date                 MULL\n        2017-05-01 00:00:00 0.515\n        2017-05-01 01:00:00 0.062\n        ... \n\n We must output exactly 96 records.\n\n We are aware that this is a simple average and might not be the most accurate, but given the constraints, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n If we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture weekly patterns or trends.\n\n We output the data in the required XML-like format.\n\n Note: The next day after 2017-04-30 is 2017-05-01.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-05-01 00:00:00\n   End:   2017-05-04 23:00:00\n\n We'll create a list of 96 records.\n\n We have the 24 averages as a list:\n\n   avg = [0.515, 0.062, 0.098, 0.355, 0.124, -0.036, 0.657, 0.266, 0.880, 0.675, 1.119, 1.297, 0.524, 1.155, 0.604, 0.542, 0.089, 0.000, -0.284, -0.204, -0.204, 0.134, -0.302, 0.649]\n\n Then for day 1 (May 1): use avg[0] to avg[23]\n        May 1, 00:00:00 -> avg[0] = 0.515\n        May 1, 01:00:00 -> avg[1] = 0.062\n        ...\n        May 1, 23:00:00 -> avg[23] = 0.649\n\n Then day 2 (May 2): same list again.\n\n And so on for 4 days.\n\n We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-01 00:00:00 0.515\n2017-05-01 01:00:00 0.062\n2017-05-01 02:00:00 0.098\n2017-05-01 03:00:00 0.355\n...\n2017-05-04 23:00:00 0.649\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the input had the MULL values as floats with 3 decimal places. We rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n Let's generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n We'll create a list of dates:\n\n   dates = []\n   start = datetime(2017, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0)\n   for i in range(96):\n        date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n        # format as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n And the value for the i-th hour: \n        value = avg[i % 24]\n\n But note: we computed the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) and then we repeat.\n\n We output:\n\n        date_string   value (with 3 decimal places)\n\n We must be cautious: the rounding we did earlier was to 3 decimals. We'll represent the numbers as strings with 3 decimals.\n\n However, note that the input had negative numbers and we have negative numbers in the averages.\n\n We'll write the numbers as: \n        if positive: e.g., 0.515\n        if negative: e.g., -0.036\n\n We have to be careful with the formatting of the numbers to have exactly 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: \n        Hour5: -0.036 -> that is -0.036, which is the same as -0.0360? We only need 3 decimals.\n\n We'll format each number to have 3 decimal places: \n        format: \"{:.3f}\".format(x)\n\n Example: \n        x = 0.515 -> \"0.515\"\n        x = -0.036 -> \"-0.036\"\n\n However, note that in the input, the numbers are given with exactly 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll do the same.\n\n Let's generate the 96 lines.\n\n We have the 24 averages as:\n\n   avg_rounded = [\n        0.515, 0.062, 0.098, 0.355, 0.124, -0.036, \n        0.657, 0.266, 0.880, 0.675, 1.119, 1.297, \n        0.524, 1.155, 0.604, 0.542, 0.089, 0.000, \n        -0.284, -0.204, -0.204, 0.134, -0.302, 0.649\n   ]\n\n Then for each day in 0..3 (4 days) and for each hour in 0..23, we output:\n\n        date = start + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour) \n        But note: we are iterating by hour from 0 to 95.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            value = avg_rounded[i % 24]\n\n We'll generate the string for each line: \n        f\"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')} {value:.3f}\"\n\n But note: the value is already rounded to 3 decimal places? We have the list as rounded to 3 decimal places? \n   Actually, we rounded the averages to 3 decimal places, but we can represent them as floats and then format to 3 decimals to be safe.\n\n However, we have stored the rounded values as floats, and when we format to 3f, it will show 3 decimals.\n\n But note: 0.00025 rounded to 0.000 -> when formatted to 3f, it becomes \"0.000\".\n\n We'll do:\n\n        value = avg_rounded[i % 24]\n        line = f\"{date} {value:.3f}\"\n\n But the date format: we must output as \"2017-05-01 00:00:00\"\n\n We can use: \n        date_str = (start + timedelta(hours=i)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n However, we are in a text-based environment. We can generate the dates manually.\n\n Since the start is 2017-05-01 00:00:00, then:\n\n        Day 0: 2017-05-01\n        Day 1: 2017-05-02\n        Day 2: 2017-05-03\n        Day 3: 2017-05-04\n\n For hour 0 to 23 on each day.\n\n We can do:\n\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = f\"2017-05-{day+1:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = avg_rounded[hour]\n                print(f\"{date} {value:.3f}\")\n\n But note: the day in the date: May 1, 2, 3, 4 -> so we use:\n\n        day0: 01, day1: 02, day2: 03, day3: 04.\n\n However, the day in the string: we must have two digits for the day.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n        for day in [1,2,3,4]:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-05-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = avg_rounded[hour]\n                # format value to 3 decimals\n\n But note: the hour: 0 -> \"00\", 1->\"01\", ... 23->\"23\"\n\n We'll write:\n\n        lines = []\n        for day in range(1,5):   # days: 1,2,3,4\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-05-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = avg_rounded[hour]\n                # Format value to 3 decimal places\n                line = f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\"\n                lines.append(line)\n\n Then we output the 96 lines.\n\n But note: the input had the date in the format: \"2017-04-27 00:00:00\", so we are consistent.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the month of May is 05.\n\n We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n Let's write the complete answer.\n",
