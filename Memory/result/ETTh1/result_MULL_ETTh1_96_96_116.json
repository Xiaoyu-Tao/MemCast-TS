        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 4. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same hourly frequency.\n\n 5. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the data, we can try to model the series. The data shows:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours) because the pattern repeats every day.\n    - The values are continuous and show a pattern: higher during the day and lower at night? But note: the values on 2017-10-08 and 2017-10-09 show a peak around 11:00-12:00 and then drop, and then again a peak in the evening? But the pattern is not very clear.\n\n 6. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we have only 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 4 days, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) as the forecast.\n    - But note: the data from day to day might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n    The last day (2017-10-11) has lower values than the first day (2017-10-08). However, we don't have enough data to determine a long-term trend.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonality. However, with only 4 days, it's challenging to fit a complex model.\n\n 8. Considering the requirement and the simplicity, we might use a seasonal naive model for each hour. But note: the data has a weekly pattern? We don't have a week of data. We have 4 days: from Sunday (2017-10-08) to Wednesday (2017-10-11). \n\n 9. We can also consider using the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But 4 days is very short.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the last day (2017-10-11) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might be too complex.\n\n 11. Given the data, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the data has a clear daily pattern. We can try to decompose the series and then forecast.\n\n 12. Since the problem is small and we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we can use a simple method: \n      - For each hour in the next day (24 hours), we take the average of that hour over the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 13. However, note that the data does not show a clear trend and the values are fluctuating. We can use the last day (2017-10-11) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be 24 hours, and then we need 4 days (96 hours). So we can repeat the last 4 days? That doesn't make sense.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a seasonal naive model that uses the same hour from the previous day. But we don't have the previous day for the next day? We can do:\n\n     Let the last day in the data is 2017-10-11 (Wednesday). Then:\n        Day 1 of forecast: 2017-10-12 (Thursday) -> use the same hour from 2017-10-11 (Wednesday) \n        Day 2: 2017-10-13 (Friday) -> use the same hour from 2017-10-10 (Tuesday) ? But we don't have Thursday to use for Friday.\n\n     Actually, we don't have a full week to capture the weekly pattern. So we might assume that the pattern is daily? Then we can use the same hour from the previous day for the entire forecast.\n\n     But note: the data from 2017-10-08 (Sunday) to 2017-10-11 (Wednesday) might have a weekly pattern? We don't have data to capture weekly.\n\n 15. Given the constraints, we can use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days. This will give a typical day pattern.\n\n     Steps:\n        - For hour 00:00: we have 4 values: 2.630 (2017-10-08), 2.025 (2017-10-09), 2.310 (2017-10-10), 2.239 (2017-10-11) -> average = (2.630+2.025+2.310+2.239)/4 = 2.301\n        - Similarly for each hour.\n\n     Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) would be the same typical day repeated 4 times.\n\n 16. But note: the data shows a downward trend? The values on 2017-10-11 are generally lower than 2017-10-08. So we might adjust for a trend.\n\n     We can compute the linear trend over the 4 days and then adjust the typical day by the trend? However, 4 days is too short for a linear trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-10-11) and then adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might be overfitting.\n\n 18. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have much data, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 19. How to handle missing values? The provided data does not missing values in the 96 points. So we don't need to impute for the historical data. But if in the forecast we are to generate 96 points, we will generate without missing.\n\n 20. Steps for the next 96 hours (from 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00) we will have 4 days. Each day will have the same 24 values (the average of the same hour from the 4 historical days).\n\n 21. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00: (2.630 + 2.025 + 2.310 + 2.239) / 4 = 2.301\n     Hour 01: (2.416 + 3.482 + 2.772 + 1.706) / 4 = 2.594\n     ... and so on.\n\n 22. But note: the data for the same hour might be missing? In our case, we have all 4 days for each hour.\n\n 23. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 24. Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 25. However, we must note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have enough to capture weekly. So we assume daily seasonality only.\n\n 26. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     We'll group by the time of day (ignoring the date) and compute the mean.\n\n     The data:\n\n        Hour 00: [2.630, 2.025, 2.310, 2.239] -> 2.301\n        Hour 01: [2.416, 3.482, 2.772, 1.706] -> (2.416+3.482+2.772+1.706)/4 = 10.376/4 = 2.594\n        Hour 02: [2.487, 2.168, 2.452, 1.919] -> (2.487+2.168+2.452+1.919)/4 = 9.026/4 = 2.2565\n        Hour 03: [3.056, 2.203, 2.132, 2.559] -> (3.056+2.203+2.132+2.559)/4 = 9.95/4 = 2.4875\n        Hour 04: [2.559, 2.523, 2.452, 1.670] -> (2.559+2.523+2.452+1.670)/4 = 9.204/4 = 2.301\n        Hour 05: [2.487, 0.853, 1.741, 2.097] -> (2.487+0.853+1.741+2.097)/4 = 7.178/4 = 1.7945\n        Hour 06: [3.340, 1.421, 1.883, 0.959] -> (3.340+1.421+1.883+0.959)/4 = 7.603/4 = 1.90075\n        Hour 07: [2.665, 2.594, 2.168, 1.386] -> (2.665+2.594+2.168+1.386)/4 = 8.813/4 = 2.20325\n        Hour 08: [2.665, 3.127, 1.741, 2.132] -> (2.665+3.127+1.741+2.132)/4 = 9.665/4 = 2.41625\n        Hour 09: [2.310, 3.589, 1.066, 1.315] -> (2.310+3.589+1.066+1.315)/4 = 8.28/4 = 2.07\n        Hour 10: [3.873, 4.620, 1.670, 0.817] -> (3.873+4.620+1.670+0.817)/4 = 10.98/4 = 2.745\n        Hour 11: [5.757, 5.046, 3.234, 0.853] -> (5.757+5.046+3.234+0.853)/4 = 14.89/4 = 3.7225\n        Hour 12: [4.087, 4.548, 1.031, 0.107] -> (4.087+4.548+1.031+0.107)/4 = 9.773/4 = 2.44325\n        Hour 13: [4.371, 4.548, 1.066, 0.320] -> (4.371+4.548+1.066+0.320)/4 = 10.305/4 = 2.57625\n        Hour 14: [3.696, 3.696, 0.959, 0.604] -> (3.696+3.696+0.959+0.604)/4 = 8.955/4 = 2.23875\n        Hour 15: [2.594, 3.376, 0.959, 0.497] -> (2.594+3.376+0.959+0.497)/4 = 7.426/4 = 1.8565\n        Hour 16: [0.817, 2.310, 0.888, 0.604] -> (0.817+2.310+0.888+0.604)/4 = 4.619/4 = 1.15475\n        Hour 17: [0.497, 0.959, 0.675, 0.533] -> (0.497+0.959+0.675+0.533)/4 = 2.664/4 = 0.666\n        Hour 18: [-0.497, -0.071, 0.249, -0.142] -> (-0.497-0.071+0.249-0.142)/4 = (-0.461)/4 = -0.11525\n        Hour 19: [0.249, 0.249, 0.000, -0.142] -> (0.249+0.249+0.000-0.142)/4 = 0.356/4 = 0.089\n        Hour 20: [0.249, 0.142, -0.036, -0.320] -> (0.249+0.142-0.036-0.320)/4 = 0.035/4 = 0.00875\n        Hour 21: [1.919, -0.711, -0.817, -0.959] -> (1.919-0.711-0.817-0.959)/4 = (-0.568)/4 = -0.142\n        Hour 22: [1.279, 1.137, 0.569, -0.640] -> (1.279+1.137+0.569-0.640)/4 = 2.345/4 = 0.58625\n        Hour 23: [2.203, 2.097, 1.812, 0.746] -> (2.203+2.097+1.812+0.746)/4 = 6.858/4 = 1.7145\n\n 27. Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-12 23:00:00: [2.301, 2.594, 2.2565, ... , 1.7145]\n        Day 2: 2017-10-13: same 24 values\n        Day 3: 2017-10-14: same\n        Day 4: 2017-10-15: same\n\n 28. But note: the last date in the given data is 2017-10-11 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-10-12 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-10-15 23:00:00\n\n 29. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 30. Format: the same as the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the MULL value.\n\n 31. We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n 32. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing.\n\n 33. We'll output the data in the required format.\n\n 34. Let's write the forecast:\n\n     We have the 24 values for a typical day:\n\n        hour00: 2.301\n        hour01: 2.594\n        hour02: 2.2565\n        hour03: 2.4875\n        hour04: 2.301\n        hour05: 1.7945\n        hour06: 1.90075\n        hour07: 2.20325\n        hour08: 2.41625\n        hour09: 2.07\n        hour10: 2.745\n        hour11: 3.7225\n        hour12: 2.44325\n        hour13: 2.57625\n        hour14: 2.23875\n        hour15: 1.8565\n        hour16: 1.15475\n        hour17: 0.666\n        hour18: -0.11525\n        hour19: 0.089\n        hour20: 0.00875\n        hour21: -0.142\n        hour22: 0.58625\n        hour23: 1.7145\n\n 35. Now, we generate 4 days:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-10-12\n       00:00:00 -> 2.301\n       01:00:00 -> 2.594\n       ... until 23:00:00 -> 1.7145\n\n     Day 2: 2017-10-13: same values\n     Day 3: 2017-10-14: same\n     Day 4: 2017-10-15: same\n\n 36. We must output the data in the same structure as the input, with the date and the MULL value.\n\n 37. We'll generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-10-12 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-10-12 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n\n 38. We'll write the data in a list and then format it.\n\n 39. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 40. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. But note: the averages we computed with more precision. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 42. However, the problem does not specify rounding. But the input had 3 decimals. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 43. Let's recalculate the averages rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour00: 2.301 -> 2.301\n        hour01: 2.594 -> 2.594\n        hour02: 2.2565 -> 2.257\n        hour03: 2.4875 -> 2.488\n        hour04: 2.301 -> 2.301\n        hour05: 1.7945 -> 1.795\n        hour06: 1.90075 -> 1.901\n        hour07: 2.20325 -> 2.203\n        hour08: 2.41625 -> 2.416\n        hour09: 2.07 -> 2.070   (to 3 decimals)\n        hour10: 2.745 -> 2.745\n        hour11: 3.7225 -> 3.723\n        hour12: 2.44325 -> 2.443\n        hour13: 2.57625 -> 2.576\n        hour14: 2.23875 -> 2.239\n        hour15: 1.8565 -> 1.857\n        hour16: 1.15475 -> 1.155\n        hour17: 0.666 -> 0.666\n        hour18: -0.11525 -> -0.115\n        hour19: 0.089 -> 0.089\n        hour20: 0.00875 -> 0.009\n        hour21: -0.142 -> -0.142\n        hour22: 0.58625 -> 0.586\n        hour23: 1.7145 -> 1.715\n\n 44. Now, we write the data.\n\n 45. We must output in the exact format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-12 00:00:00  2.301\n2017-10-12 01:00:00  2.594\n...\n2017-10-15 23:00:00  1.715\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 46. We generate the dates:\n\n     We start at 2017-10-12 00:00:00 and then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 47. We'll create a list of the 96 values: [2.301, 2.594, 2.257, ...] repeated 4 times? Actually, we have 24 values and we repeat them 4 times.\n\n 48. We'll create the list:\n\n        forecast_values = [2.301, 2.594, 2.257, 2.488, 2.301, 1.795, 1.901, 2.203, 2.416, 2.070, 2.745, 3.723, 2.443, 2.576, 2.239, 1.857, 1.155, 0.666, -0.115, 0.089, 0.009, -0.142, 0.586, 1.715] * 4\n\n 49. Then we generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 12, 10, 0, 0,  -> wait, the last date in the data is 2017-10-11, so next is 2017-10-12.\n\n        We'll use: \n            base_date = datetime(2017, 10, 12)  -> but wait, the last date is 2017-10-11 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-10-12 00:00:00.\n\n        We can generate 96 hours from that start.\n\n 50. We'll use:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        start = datetime(2017, 10, 12, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [start + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 51. But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n 52. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 53. We have the 24 values for one day, and we repeat 4 times.\n\n 54.
