        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00). We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any explicit missing (like NaN). However, we see some zeros and negative values which might be actual readings or indicate missing? But the user says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days), we can use a time series model. Given the small data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we might use a model that can handle short-term dependencies.\n\n 3. We note that the data has a daily pattern (diurnal variation). For example, we see peaks at certain hours and drops at others.\n\n 4. We must handle the missing values. However, in the provided data, there are no explicit missing (like gaps). But the user warns that the data will have missing values. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we assume that the missing values might be in the future? But the instruction says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then we are to forecast the next 96. So the provided 96 are complete? The user says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values\" - meaning the entire dataset (including the past) might have missing? But in the provided 96, we don't see any. So we proceed with the provided 96 points as complete.\n\n 5. We can use a model like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple seasonal model. However, with only 96 points, we can try a seasonal ARIMA model with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual.\n    - Forecast each component.\n\n 7. But note: the data has some zeros and negative values? The negative values are present (e.g., -0.107, -0.675). This might be normal for this metric? We'll assume it's acceptable.\n\n 8. We'll use a model that can handle seasonality. We choose SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). We have to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q, s=24).\n\n 9. However, with only 4 days of data, the seasonality might not be very stable. We might also consider using a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide 96 points, we can use a simple approach: \n     - Compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the last known value.\n\n 11. But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the last day (2016-12-03) has a drop at the end? It's not clear.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the following:\n     - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days. Then we use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a flat forecast per hour. However, we see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n 13. We can also use a naive method: use the last day (2016-12-03) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have to forecast 4 days.\n\n 14. Considering the data has only 4 days, we can do:\n     - Forecast the next day by taking the average of the previous 4 days for each hour? Then we can use that for the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 15. We can also use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality. The Holt-Winters method is suitable for data with trend and seasonality.\n\n 16. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n 17. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n     - We have to set the seasonal period to 24 (hourly data, daily seasonality).\n     - We'll fit the model on the 96 points and then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 18. However, note: the data has negative values. The additive model can handle negative values? Yes, because it's additive.\n\n 19. But we must be cautious: the model might not be able to fit well with only 4 days.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use a more robust method: \n      - Impute any missing values in the provided data? But we don't see any missing in the provided 96.\n\n 21. We'll use the Holt-Winters method. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels.\n\n 22. We'll code in Python (but note: we are to output the forecast in the required format).\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the forecast. We are not coding in the response, but we are to generate the forecast.\n\n 23. Since we cannot run code in this environment, we have to simulate the process.\n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use a simple average method to generate the forecast:\n\n     Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have.\n\n     Hour 0: (3.838 + 2.878 + 2.239 + 4.264) / 4 = (3.838+2.878+2.239+4.264)=13.219/4=3.30475\n     Hour 1: (4.300+3.340+2.168+4.371)/4 = (4.300+3.340+2.168+4.371)=14.179/4=3.54475\n\n     and so on.\n\n     Then the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 25. But we see that the pattern is not exactly the same? For example, the last day (2016-12-03) has a drop at hour 6 (0.036) which is an outlier? \n\n 26. We can use the median for each hour to avoid the effect of outliers? But we only have 4 points per hour.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-03) as the pattern and then adjust by the overall level? But how?\n\n 28. Given the simplicity and the requirement, we'll use the average method.\n\n 29. Steps for average method:\n     - Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n 30. Then for the next 4 days (from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00), we assign the average value for that hour.\n\n 31. But note: the data has a trend? We don't have enough data to see a long-term trend, so we ignore.\n\n 32. We'll compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 0: [3.838, 2.878, 2.239, 4.264] -> mean = (3.838+2.878+2.239+4.264)/4 = 13.219/4 = 3.30475\n     Hour 1: [4.300, 3.340, 2.168, 4.371] -> (4.300+3.340+2.168+4.371)=14.179/4=3.54475\n     Hour 2: [3.660, 3.305, 2.097, 3.625] -> (3.660+3.305+2.097+3.625)=12.687/4=3.17175\n     Hour 3: [3.980, 2.949, 2.097, 3.909] -> (3.980+2.949+2.097+3.909)=12.935/4=3.23375\n     Hour 4: [3.909, 2.736, 1.492, 3.269] -> (3.909+2.736+1.492+3.269)=11.406/4=2.8515\n     Hour 5: [4.726, 2.772, 2.559, 2.523] -> (4.726+2.772+2.559+2.523)=12.58/4=3.145\n     Hour 6: [3.340, 2.807, 2.381, 0.036] -> (3.340+2.807+2.381+0.036)=8.564/4=2.141\n     Hour 7: [3.340, 2.168, 2.310, 2.274] -> (3.340+2.168+2.310+2.274)=10.092/4=2.523\n     Hour 8: [3.411, 2.559, 1.244, 3.198] -> (3.411+2.559+1.244+3.198)=10.412/4=2.603\n     Hour 9: [2.274, 3.447, 2.025, 1.528] -> (2.274+3.447+2.025+1.528)=9.274/4=2.3185\n     Hour 10: [2.452, 2.594, 1.812, 1.777] -> (2.452+2.594+1.812+1.777)=8.635/4=2.15875\n     Hour 11: [2.025, 2.274, 1.848, 1.883] -> (2.025+2.274+1.848+1.883)=8.03/4=2.0075\n     Hour 12: [1.031, 0.782, 0.782, 0.426] -> (1.031+0.782+0.782+0.426)=3.021/4=0.75525\n     Hour 13: [1.635, 2.132, 1.564, 1.421] -> (1.635+2.132+1.564+1.421)=6.752/4=1.688\n     Hour 14: [2.097, 2.416, 1.848, 2.061] -> (2.097+2.416+1.848+2.061)=8.422/4=2.1055\n     Hour 15: [1.706, 2.736, 1.244, 2.168] -> (1.706+2.736+1.244+2.168)=7.854/4=1.9635\n     Hour 16: [2.025, 2.523, 1.706, 2.097] -> (2.025+2.523+1.706+2.097)=8.351/4=2.08775\n     Hour 17: [1.777, 2.025, 1.208, 1.457] -> (1.777+2.025+1.208+1.457)=6.467/4=1.61675\n     Hour 18: [1.706, 0.000, 0.782, 0.711] -> (1.706+0+0.782+0.711)=3.199/4=0.79975\n     Hour 19: [1.741, 0.000, 0.675, 0.533] -> (1.741+0+0.675+0.533)=2.949/4=0.73725\n     Hour 20: [1.706, 0.213, 0.782, 0.391] -> (1.706+0.213+0.782+0.391)=3.092/4=0.773\n     Hour 21: [1.137, -0.107, 0.142, -0.675] -> (1.137-0.107+0.142-0.675)=0.497/4=0.12425\n     Hour 22: [1.564, 0.853, 2.097, 2.025] -> (1.564+0.853+2.097+2.025)=6.539/4=1.63475\n     Hour 23: [2.203, 1.421, 3.092, 1.990] -> (2.203+1.421+3.092+1.990)=8.706/4=2.1765\n\n 33. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n     Day 1 (2016-12-04):\n        00:00:00 -> 3.30475\n        01:00:00 -> 3.54475\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 2.1765\n\n     Day 2 (2016-12-05): same as above\n     Day 3 (2016-12-06): same\n     Day 4 (2016-12-07): same\n\n 34. But note: the user might have daylight saving time? The data is from November and December, but we don't adjust.\n\n 35. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 36. The last date in the input is 2016-12-03 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n     2016-12-04 00:00:00\n     2016-12-04 01:00:00\n     ...\n     2016-12-07 23:00:00\n\n 37. We'll output the forecast with the date and the MULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 38. However, we note that the input has some negative values and zeros, so we keep the sign.\n\n 39. We'll write the forecast:\n\n     We have 4 days, each day 24 hours, so 96 records.\n\n 40. We output in the required format.\n\n 41. But note: the user said the data might have missing values? We are generating the forecast without missing? So we output the forecast as complete.\n\n 42. We'll generate the data:\n\n     We'll create a list of dates from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00, and for each hour in the day, we use the precomputed average for that hour.\n\n 43. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input has 3 decimal places.\n\n 44. However, note: the average might have more decimals. We round to 3.\n\n 45. Example:\n\n        Hour0: 3.30475 -> 3.305\n        Hour1: 3.54475 -> 3.545\n\n 46. But note: the input has negative and zeros, so we must format correctly.\n\n 47. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 48. Since the problem says we must provide the complete data and not omit any content, we write all 96 lines.\n\n 49. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-04 00:00:00  3.305\n2016-12-04 01:00:00  3.545\n... \n2016-12-07 23:00:00  2.177   [because 2.1765 rounded to 3 decimals is 2.177?]\n\n 50. Rounding: \n        3.30475 -> 3.305 (since 4.75, rounding to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 7 which is >=5, so round up the 3rd decimal from 4 to 5? \n        Actually: 3.30475: \n            thousandths place is 4, and the digit after is 7 (>=5) -> so 3.305.\n\n 51. Similarly, 2.1765: \n        thousandths place is 6, and the next digit is 5 -> round up 6 to 7 -> 2.177.\n\n 52. But note: the input has negative numbers? We do the same rounding.\n\n 53.

There are different rounding rules, but we'll use round half to even? \n     But the problem doesn't specify. We'll use the common method: round half up.\n\n     We'll use: \n         value = round(x, 3)\n\n     In Python: \n         round(3.30475, 3) -> 3.305\n         round(3.54475, 3) -> 3.545\n         round(3.17175, 3) -> 3.172\n         round(3.23375, 3) -> 3.234\n         round(2.8515, 3) -> 2.852\n         round(3.145, 3) -> 3.145? Actually, 3.145 is already 3 decimal? \n         But 3.145: if we have 3.145, then it's 3.145. But 3.145 is the average for hour5?
