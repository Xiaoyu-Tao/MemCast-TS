        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-07-28 00:00:00 to 2017-07-31 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, we see that from 2017-07-31 00:00:00 to 2017-07-31 23:00:00, the value is constant at 19.691999. \n This might be an anomaly or missing data pattern? But the problem says the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We must handle the missing values in the input data. However, the provided data does not have explicit NaNs, but the constant value for the entire day of 2017-07-31 is suspicious.\n    It could be that the sensor was stuck or data was imputed with a constant. We need to decide how to treat this.\n\n 2. Since the problem states that the data has missing values, we should first impute the missing values in the historical data before forecasting.\n\n 3. But note: the problem does not specify which points are missing. In the given data, the last 24 points (2017-07-31) are constant. This is likely an issue.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use an approach that is robust to missing data, or we can impute the missing values.\n\n However, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided data, we don't see any explicit NaNs. \n The constant value for 24 hours is highly unlikely in a real-world scenario. Therefore, we can treat the entire day of 2017-07-31 as missing and impute it.\n\n But note: the problem does not tell us which values are missing. So we have to rely on the data we are given. Alternatively, we can use a model that can handle missing data.\n\n However, for simplicity and given the problem, we are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a time series model that can handle some missing data, but the provided data does not have NaNs.\n\n Since the last 24 points are constant, we might consider that as an anomaly. But without explicit instruction, we will proceed with the data as given.\n\n But note: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and we are given 96 rows. So we have to use this data.\n\n 4. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a time series model. Given the hourly data, we might expect seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n 5. We note that the data shows a daily pattern: temperature drops at night and rises during the day? But looking at the data, it's not exactly clear.\n\n 6. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n\n However, the data for the last day (2017-07-31) is constant, which might break the pattern. We have to decide whether to use that day or not? But the problem says we have 96 records, so we must use all.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but that might be overkill and we don't have a lot of data.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we will use a simple method: \n    - We can use linear interpolation for the constant part? But that might not be justified.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the last known good data? But the problem does not specify.\n\n 10. Since the problem does not specify the nature of the missingness, and we are to forecast the next 96 points, we will proceed by:\n     a) Using the entire 96 points as given, and build a model that can handle the constant part as an outlier? \n     b) We can use a robust model.\n\n 11. We choose to use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components. But the constant part will dominate the last day.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use an imputation for the last day. We can replace the constant values with the average of the same hour from the previous days? \n\n    For example, for 2017-07-31 00:00:00, we can take the average of 2017-07-28 00:00:00, 2017-07-29 00:00:00, 2017-07-30 00:00:00.\n\n    But note: we have 3 days of data before 2017-07-31? Actually, we have:\n        Day 1: 2017-07-28 (24 hours)\n        Day 2: 2017-07-29 (24 hours)\n        Day 3: 2017-07-30 (24 hours)\n        Day 4: 2017-07-31 (24 hours) -> constant\n\n    So we can impute the last day by the average of the previous three days for each hour.\n\n    Steps for imputation:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) of 2017-07-31, we set:\n            value = (value at h on 2017-07-28 + value at h on 2017-07-29 + value at h on 2017-07-30) / 3\n\n    But note: the data for 2017-07-30 00:00:00 is 20.697001, 2017-07-29 00:00:00 is 13.195000, 2017-07-28 00:00:00 is 13.329000.\n        So for hour 00:00:00: (13.329 + 13.195 + 20.697) / 3 = 15.74\n\n    We do this for each hour.\n\n    However, the problem does not tell us to impute, but it says \"be aware of missing values\". Since the constant value is suspicious, we will impute the last day.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says \"the dataset\" (which we are given) has missing values. So we are allowed to impute.\n\n 14. We will impute the last day (2017-07-31) by the average of the same hour of the previous three days.\n\n 15. Then we will use the entire 96 points (with the last day imputed) to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 16. We will use a model: SARIMA. We have seasonality of 24 hours (so seasonal period s=24).\n\n 17. Steps for SARIMA:\n     - We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,s=24). This is non-trivial.\n\n 18. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we can use an automated method to select the best SARIMA model.\n\n 19. However, we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code. So we have to use a heuristic.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: \n      - We can use the last week's pattern? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 21. Given the small data, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n      - Forecast each hour of the average of that hour in the available days? But we have only 3 full days (after imputation we have 4 days, but the last day is imputed from the previous 3).\n\n 22. Actually, we have 4 days of data (including the imputed one). We can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next day? \n\n     But note: we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). So we can repeat the pattern of the last 4 days? \n\n     However, that would be a naive approach.\n\n 23. We can do:\n      - For the next 96 hours (4 days), we use the average of the same hour from the 4 available days.\n\n     For example, for the first hour (00:00:00) of 2017-08-01, we take the average of the 00:00:00 of 2017-07-28, 2017-07-29, 2017-07-30, and 2017-07-31 (imputed).\n\n     Similarly for each hour.\n\n 24. But note: the data has a trend? We don't have enough data to see a trend. Also, the last day (2017-07-31) was imputed from the previous three, so it's an average already.\n\n 25. This method would be a seasonal naive forecast with averaging.\n\n 26. Steps:\n        Let D0: 2017-07-28 (original)\n        D1: 2017-07-29 (original)\n        D2: 2017-07-30 (original)\n        D3: 2017-07-31 (imputed by average of D0, D1, D2 for each hour)\n\n        Then for the next day D4 (2017-08-01), we set for hour h: \n            HUFL = (D0_h + D1_h + D2_h + D3_h) / 4\n\n        Similarly, for D5 (2017-08-02): we set the same as D4? But we don't have D4. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same 4-day pattern? But we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). We can do:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-08-01): average of the 4 days for each hour.\n        Day 2 (2017-08-02): we don't have data? We can use the same as Day 1? Or we can use the average again? \n\n        But note: we are to forecast 4 days. We can use the same 4-day pattern? But we don't have a pattern for the next days.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days as the pattern and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n\n        So for 2017-08-01 00:00:00: average of the 4 days at 00:00:00\n        for 2017-08-01 01:00:00: average of the 4 days at 01:00:00\n        ... \n        for 2017-08-01 23:00:00: average of the 4 days at 23:00:00\n\n        Then for 2017-08-02, we use the same values as 2017-08-01? \n\n        But that would be a flat forecast for the next days? \n\n 28. We can do: \n        We have 4 days of data. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (so 24 averages). Then we use these 24 averages for each day in the forecast period.\n\n        So for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 29. This is a simple and reasonable approach given the data.\n\n 30. Steps for imputation of the last day (2017-07-31) for each hour h (0 to 23):\n\n        D3_h = (D0_h + D1_h + D2_h) / 3\n\n 31. Then compute the average for each hour h over the 4 days:\n\n        A_h = (D0_h + D1_h + D2_h + D3_h) / 4\n\n        But note: D3_h is already the average of D0_h, D1_h, D2_h, so:\n\n        A_h = (D0_h + D1_h + D2_h + (D0_h+D1_h+D2_h)/3) / 4\n             = ( (3*(D0_h+D1_h+D2_h) + (D0_h+D1_h+D2_h) ) / (3*4)\n             = (4*(D0_h+D1_h+D2_h)) / 12\n             = (D0_h+D1_h+D2_h) / 3\n\n        So A_h is the same as D3_h.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply use the average of the first three days for each hour as the pattern.\n\n 32. Therefore, we can skip imputing the last day and just use the average of the first three days for each hour? \n\n        But note: the problem says we have 96 points and we must use them. And the last day is given as constant. \n\n        However, we decided to impute the last day because it was constant. But then we found that the average of the four days (with the last day being the average of the first three) is the same as the average of the first three.\n\n        So we can just use the average of the first three days for each hour as the pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 33. But wait, we have 4 days of data? We are to forecast 4 days. We can use the average of the first three days for each hour and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 34. However, we have the last day (2017-07-31) as constant. We are not sure if it is valid. So we have two options:\n\n        Option 1: Use the entire 4 days (with the last day imputed) and then the average pattern is the same as the average of the first three.\n\n        Option 2: Ignore the last day and use only the first three days to compute the pattern.\n\n        But note: the problem says we have 96 points. We are to use all. So we are imputing the last day to make it non-constant, and then we use it. But then we found that the average of the four days is the same as the average of the first three.\n\n        So we can use the average of the first three days for each hour as the pattern.\n\n 35. Therefore, we compute:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23): \n            pattern_h = (value at day0_h + day1_h + day2_h) / 3\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-08-01 to 2017-08-04), we set each day's hour h to pattern_h.\n\n 36. But note: the data for the first three days are:\n\n        Day0: 2017-07-28\n        Day1: 2017-07-29\n        Day2: 2017-07-30\n\n 37. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Example for hour 00:00:00:\n            day0: 13.329000\n            day1: 13.195000\n            day2: 20.697001\n            average = (13.329 + 13.195 + 20.697) / 3 = 47.221001 / 3 = 15.7403336667\n\n        Similarly for each hour.\n\n 38. Then we create the next 4 days by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 39. The dates for the last given point is 2017-07-31 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        2017-08-01 00:00:00\n        2017-08-01 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-08-04 23:00:00\n\n 40. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 41. However, note: the data has a trend? The average might not capture a trend. But with only 3 days, it's hard to capture a trend. \n\n 42. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 43. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (13.329000 + 13.195000 + 20.697001) / 3 = 15.7400003333\n        Hour 1: (13.128000 + 14.200000 + 20.697001) / 3 = 16.0083336667\n        ... \n\n 44. We have to do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 45. But note: the data for the third day (2017-07-30) has 24 hours? Yes.\n\n 46. We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the three days.\n\n 47. Then we create 4 days of data by repeating the 24 averages 4 times.\n\n 48. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 49: We note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 50. Steps to compute:\n\n        hours = [0,1,...,23]\n        averages = []\n        for h in hours:\n            values = [day0[h], day1[h], day2[h]]\n            avg = sum(values) / 3\n            rounded_avg = round(avg, 3)\n            averages.append(rounded_avg)\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we repeat the list 'averages' 4 times.\n\n 51. Now, we need to generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-01 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-08-04 23:00:00\n\n        We generate 96 timestamps at hourly frequency.\n\n 52. We write the data in the format:\n\n        date, HUFL\n        2017-08-01 00:00:00, <avg0>\n        2017-08-01 01:00:00, <avg1>\n        ...\n        2017-08-01 23:00:00, <avg23>\n        2017-08-02 00:00:00, <avg0>\n        ... and so on.\n\n 53. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        We'll extract the data for the three days:\n\n        Day0: 2017-07-28: rows 0 to 23\n        Day1: 2017-07-29: rows 24 to 47\n        Day2: 2017-07-30: rows 48 to 71\n\n        Note: the last day (2017-07-31) is rows 72 to 95, but we are not using it for the average because we are using the first three days.\n\n        However, we decided to use the first three days to compute the pattern.\n\n 54.

We generate 96 rows.\n\n 61. We note that the pattern repeats every 24 hours.\n\n 62. We write the complete data.\n\n 63. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values. We have handled the historical missing values by ignoring the last day (which was constant) and using the first three days to form the pattern. Then we forecast by repeating the pattern.\n\n 64.
