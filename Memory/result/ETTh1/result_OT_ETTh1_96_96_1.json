        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency and the apparent daily seasonality (temperature patterns repeat every 24 hours), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast the next 96 points (4 days), we can use a simple model that captures:\n    - Trend: The data does not show a strong trend over 4 days? Let's check: \n        The values range from about 24 to 38, but within each day we see a cycle. \n        might be a slight upward trend? But 4 days is too short for a long-term trend. We can assume a daily pattern and a possible weekly pattern? \n        However, we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern cannot be captured. Therefore, we focus on daily seasonality.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal decomposition and then project the seasonal component forward? But we have only 4 days, so we can compute the average daily pattern and then use that for the next 4 days? \n\n    However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can use the entire 96 points.\n\n 5. Let's break the data into 4 days (each of 24 hours). We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend or a level shift? We can remove the daily average and then model the residual? However, with only 4 days, it's tricky.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality. But we are limited data.\n\n 7. Since the problem does not specify the method, we choose a method that is suitable for short-term forecasting with seasonality: \n    We will use the average of the same hour across the available days and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n    However, note that the temperature might be increasing or decreasing over the days? Let's look at the overall level:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-07-05): min ~25.958, max ~33.13\n    Day 2: min ~24.34, max ~33.13\n    Day 3: min ~25.395, max ~38.48\n    Day 4: min ~28.77, max ~34.75\n\n    There is no clear trend. So we can assume that the daily pattern will be similar to the average of the past 4 days.\n\n 8. Steps for forecasting:\n    a) Extract the hour-of-day for each record.\n    b) Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n    c) Use that average as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the last day (day4) might be more relevant? However, we are to forecast 4 days, so we can use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 9. However, we must account for the fact that the temperature might have a slight drift? We can adjust by the last day's average? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour without adjustment.\n\n 10. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for hour 0: \n        Day1: 25.958, Day2: 28.913, Day3: 28.561, Day4: 31.093 -> average = (25.958+28.913+28.561+31.093)/4 = 28.63125\n\n     Similarly for each hour.\n\n 11. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n        Day5 (2016-07-09): hour0: 28.63125, hour1: ... until hour23\n        Day6: same as the pattern\n        Day7: same\n        Day8: same\n\n 12. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not encountered in the provided 96 points. So we use the available 4 days.\n\n 13. However, if we had missing values, we would have to impute. But the provided data is complete.\n\n 14. We generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 (the last given point is 2016-07-08 23:00:00, so next is 2016-07-09 00:00:00).\n\n 15. Implementation:\n\n     We'll create a list of the next 96 timestamps.\n\n     Then, for each hour in [0,23] for the next 4 days, we assign the average value for that hour computed from the past 4 days.\n\n 16. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n     For hour in range(24):\n        values = []\n        for day in [0,1,2,3]:\n            index = hour + day*24   # because each day has 24 hours\n            values.append(data[index])\n        hourly_avg[hour] = sum(values) / len(values)\n\n 17. Then for the forecast:\n\n        for day in range(4):   # 4 days\n            for hour in range(24):\n                timestamp = start_date + timedelta(days=day+1, hours=hour) \n                # but note: the last date is 2016-07-08 23:00:00, so the next day is 2016-07-09 00:00:00\n\n        Actually, the start for the forecast is 2016-07-09 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2016-07-12 23:00:00.\n\n 18. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        base = datetime(2016,7,8,23,0,0)   # last point\n        Then the next point is base + 1 hour = 2016-07-09 00:00:00\n\n        Actually, the last point is 2016-07-08 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-07-09 00:00:00.\n\n        We can generate 96 consecutive hours starting from 2016-07-09 00:00:00.\n\n 19. Code in Python (pseudocode):\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        # Given data (the last 96 points) as a list of two lists: dates and OT\n        # We have the data as a string, but we can parse.\n\n        # However, we are to output the next 96 points.\n\n        # Step 1: Parse the given data into a DataFrame (if we were to compute, but we are not have the environment, so we do manually)\n\n        # Instead, we can compute the hourly averages without pandas.\n\n        # Extract the OT values as a list of 96 numbers.\n        # The data string is provided, we can split by lines and then take the last number in each line.\n\n        # But note: the data string is given from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00.\n\n        # Let's list the OT values:\n\n        # We have 96 values. We can split the string by newline and then by space? But the format is fixed.\n\n        # Actually, we are to output the forecast, so we can compute the averages by hand? But 96 points is too long.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can write a small script in our mind.\n\n        # We break the 96 points into 4 days of 24 hours.\n\n        # Day0: indices 0-23\n        # Day1: 24-47\n        # Day2: 48-71\n        # Day3: 72-95\n\n        # For hour0 (00:00): indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n        # hour1: 1,25,49,73\n        # ... hour23: 23,47,71,95\n\n        # We'll create an array for each hour.\n\n        # Example for hour0: \n        #   values: [25.958, 28.913, 28.561, 31.093] -> average = (25.958+28.913+28.561+31.093)/4 = 28.63125\n\n        # We do this for each hour.\n\n        # Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n        #   Day5: hour0 to hour23: the 24 averages\n        #   Day6: same 24 averages\n        #   Day7: same\n        #   Day8: same\n\n 20. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the 96 points, so we assume complete.\n\n 21. However, we must output the forecast for the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 22. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll list the OT values in order (as given):\n\n        day0 = [25.958000, 25.958000, 26.028000, ...]  # 24 values\n        day1 = [25.958000? Actually, the first 24 are day0: 2016-07-05, then day1: 2016-07-06, etc.\n\n     We can extract:\n\n        hour0: [25.958, 28.913, 28.561, 31.093] -> 28.63125\n        hour1: [25.958, 30.389999, 28.771999, 30.742001] -> (25.958+30.39+28.772+30.742)/4 = 28.7155\n        ... \n\n     We do for all 24 hours.\n\n 23. We'll compute the average for each hour and then replicate for 4 days.\n\n 24. We must format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-07-09 00:00:00 [value1]\n2016-07-09 01:00:00 [value2]\n...\n2016-07-12 23:00:00 [value96]\n```\n\n 25. We note that the original data has 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. However, the problem does not specify the rounding, but the input has up to 6 decimal places? Actually, the input has 3 or 6? \n        The given data: 25.958000 -> we can output with 3 decimals? But let's keep 6 to be safe? \n        But the problem: \"25.958000\" -> we can output with 6 decimal places? \n\n     But note: the average might have more decimals. We'll round to 6 decimal places to match.\n\n 27. Steps:\n\n     a) Precompute the hourly averages for hour0 to hour23.\n\n     b) Generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n          start = datetime(2016, 7,9,0,0,0)   # 2016-07-09 00:00:00\n          then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n     c) For the first 24 hours (day5): use the 24 averages in order (hour0, hour1, ... hour23)\n        next 24 hours (day6): same 24 averages\n        ... until 4 days.\n\n 28.
