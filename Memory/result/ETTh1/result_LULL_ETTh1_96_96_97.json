        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hours (4 days) of data, all zeros. The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) metric.\n Since the provided data is entirely zeros, it suggests that the transformer was not in use during this period. However, without any variation, it's challenging to model a time series.\n\n Considering the context:\n - The dataset is about oil temperature and load metrics, but we are only given the \"LULL\" for this subset.\n - The data is sampled hourly (as per the timestamps).\n\n Approach:\n 1. The data provided is for 4 consecutive days (24*4=96 records) and all values are 0.0.\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). \n 3. Given the lack of any pattern (all zeros), one might assume that the transformer remains in a low-use state.\n\n However, note the problem statement: \"these data will have missing values\". But in the provided 96 records, there are no missing values (all zeros). \n\n But wait: the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning that in the original dataset there might be missing values, but in the provided past 96 records, we don't see any missing. So we proceed with the forecast.\n\n Since the past data is all zeros, the simplest forecast is to predict zeros for the next 96 hours.\n\n However, we must consider:\n - Is there any seasonality? The data is for July (summer in the northern hemisphere). But without any variation, we cannot detect seasonality.\n - Is there any trend? Again, no.\n\n Therefore, the most reasonable forecast is a constant zero for the next 96 hours.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Generate the next 96 timestamps. The last provided timestamp is 2017-07-27 23:00:00.\n    - The next timestamp would be 2017-07-28 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-31 23:00:00 (which is 4 days later, 24*4=96 hours).\n\n 2. Assign 0.0 to every hour in the forecast.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and it's possible that the transformer might start being used. However, without any indication of a change (and no non-zero data in the provided history), we have no basis to predict non-zero values.\n\n Therefore, we output 96 rows of zeros for the next 96 hours.\n\n Format:\n We must output in the exact format as the input, with two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'.\n\n Example of the first few forecasted rows:\n\n 2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n 2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n ... until 2017-07-31 23:00:00\n\n Implementation in the answer block:\n\n We'll generate the next 96 timestamps starting from 2017-07-28 00:00:00 (the hour after the last provided data point) and then 1 hour increments.\n\n Let's do it step 1: last date in the given data is 2017-07-27 23:00:00.\n step 2: the next date is 2017-07-28 00:00:00.\n\n We'll create 96 rows.\n\n We must output in the format:\n\n <answer>\n\n```\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n... (96 lines)\n2017-07-31 23:00:00   0.0\n```\n\n But note: the original data has the date as index? Actually, in the provided data, the index is the datetime string. We'll output similarly.\n\n However, the problem says \"complete data\", meaning we must output both the date and the value.\n\n We'll write:\n\n```\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n... \n```\n\n But note: the original input had the index as the datetime string and then a column named 'LULL'. However, in the input example, the index was printed without a column name for the index. We can output without an index column? Actually, the example input had:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n\n But wait, the example input has two columns: the first column is the index (which is a datetime) and then a column named 'LULL'. However, when printing, the index is not labeled. So in the output, we should have:\n\n - The first line: a header with \"                date  LULL\" (but note the alignment: the first column is the datetime string, and the second is the float).\n\n How to format:\n We can output as:\n\n [datetime string]   [value]\n\n But note the example: the datetime string is left-aligned in a 20-character field? Actually, in the example, the datetime string is exactly 19 characters and then two spaces? Let me count:\n\n \"2017-07-24 00:00:00\" is 19 characters. Then in the example, it's printed with 19 characters and then 3 spaces? Actually, the example:\n\n \"2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\"\n\n There are 3 spaces between the datetime and the value? Actually, in the example, the header is:\n\n               date  LULL\n\n And then the data:\n\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n\n So the header has \"date\" aligned to the left of the 19-character datetime? Actually, the header \"date\" is under the datetime string?\n\n We can replicate by:\n\n - The datetime string (19 characters) and then 3 spaces and then the value (formatted as float).\n\n But note: the value is a float, and we are printing 0.0 -> which is 3 characters. So:\n\n [19-character datetime string] + \"   \" + \"0.0\"\n\n However, the example header has \"date\" and \"LULL\" as two separate headers. We must output the header? The problem says \"complete data\", and the example input included a header.\n\n But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the data we were given included a header.\n\n So we output:\n\n First line: \"               date  LULL\"\n Then 96 lines of: [datetime string]   [value]\n\n However, note the first line: \"               date  LULL\" has 19 spaces? Actually, let's count:\n\n The example: \n \"               date  LULL\"\n\n The string \"date\" is aligned to the right? Actually, the example input:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n\n The header \"date\" is centered over the datetime? Actually, the datetime string is 19 characters, and the header \"date\" is printed with 19 characters of space? \n\n Actually, the example input we were given started with:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n\n The header has 19 leading spaces? Actually, no: the header line is:\n\n \"               date  LULL\"\n\n Let me count: \n - The string \"               \" has 15 spaces? Then \"date\" (4 characters) and then two spaces and \"LULL\".\n\n Actually, the entire header is: 15 spaces + \"date\" + \"  \" + \"LULL\"\n\n But the data lines: the datetime string is 19 characters, which would start at the same position as the 'd' in \"date\" is at the 16th character? \n\n Alternatively, we can output without the header? The problem says \"complete data\", and the example input had a header. But the problem does not explicitly say to include the header.\n\n However, to be safe, we'll include the header as in the example.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the complete data\", and the data we were given had a header. So we include the header.\n\n How to format the header exactly?\n The example header: \n   The first part: 15 spaces, then \"date\", then two spaces, then \"LULL\".\n\n We'll output:\n\n Line 1: \"               date  LULL\"\n Then for each row: \n   [datetime string] (which is 19 characters) and then \"   \" (three spaces) and then the value as string.\n\n But note: the value in the example was 0.0 -> which is 3 characters. So we can do:\n\n   f\"{date_str}   {value}\"\n\n However, the example had three spaces? Actually, in the example data row: \n   \"2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\" -> there are three spaces between the datetime and the 0.0.\n\n But wait: the datetime string is 19 characters, and then three spaces? Then the value.\n\n So we'll do:\n\n   date_str = \"2017-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" (19 characters) + \"   \" (3 spaces) + \"0.0\"\n\n But note: the example header has 15 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the header is:\n\n   \" * 15 + \"date  LULL\"\n\n But that doesn't align with the data. The data starts at the first column? Actually, the example:\n\n   The first data row: \"2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\"\n\n   The header: \n        \"               date  LULL\"\n\n   The '2' of 2017 is at the first character of the line? Then the header's 'd' in \"date\" is at the 16th character? \n\n   would be:\n\n   Line 1: 15 spaces, then \"date\", then two spaces, then \"LULL\"\n   Line 2: \"2017-07-24 00:00:00\" (19 characters) and then three spaces and \"0.0\"\n\n   This would align the \"date\" header over the 2017-07-24 ... string? But the \"date\" string is only 4 characters, and the datetime is 19. So the header \"date\" is centered? Actually, it's left-aligned at the 16th column? \n\n   Alternatively, the entire first column (the datetime) is 19 characters, and the header for the first column is \"date\" which is placed at the same starting position as the datetime? \n\n   But the datetime starts at column 0? and the header \"date\" is at column 0? \n\n   Actually, the example input we were given:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n\n   This is ambiguous. \n\n   However, note that the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\", and the example format in the answer block is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\n\n   And the example input we were given was without any extra spaces at the beginning of the data lines? \n\n   Actually, the example input we were given:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n\n   The first line of data (2017-07-24 00:00:00) is at the beginning of the line? \n\n   But the header has 15 spaces? \n\n   would be:\n\n   Line 1: 15 spaces, then \"date\", then two spaces, then \"LULL\"\n   Line 2: \"2017-07-24 00:00:00\" (without any leading space) and then three spaces and \"0.0\"\n\n   That would not align. \n\n   Alternatively, the header is intended to be:\n\n        date                LULL\n\n   But that's not what we see.\n\n   Let me reexamine the example input:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n\n   The first line: the string \"date\" starts at the 16th character? (because 15 spaces) and then two spaces and \"LULL\". The data line: the datetime string (19 characters) starts at the first column, and then the value at the 23rd column? (19+3=22, so the value starts at 23rd?).\n\n   The header \"LULL\" is at the 22nd column? (15+4+2 = 21, then the 'L' of LULL is at 21? and the data value \"0.0\" is at 23?).\n\n   This does not align.\n\n   Alternatively, the entire block is meant to be a DataFrame representation? \n\n   Since the problem does not specify the exact formatting of the output, and to avoid overcomplicating, we will output:\n\n   - The first line: \"               date  LULL\" (exactly as in the input)\n   - Then for each row: the datetime string (exactly in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\") followed by three spaces and then the string representation of the float (with one decimal: so 0.0).\n\n   This matches the example input.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   header = \"               date  LULL\"\n   for i in range(96):\n        date_str = (start_date + i * timedelta(hours=1)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        line = f\"{date_str}   0.0\"\n\n   But note: the example input had three spaces? Actually, in the example input row: \"2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\" -> there are three spaces between the datetime and the value.\n\n   However, in the datetime string, the hour part is two digits? So the total length is fixed.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 7, 28, 0, 0, 0)\n\n   Then for i in range(0,96):\n        current = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n        date_str = current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        print(f\"{date_str}   0.0\")\n\n   But note: the header has 15 leading spaces? We output the header as is.\n\n   However, the problem says \"complete data\", and the example input had the header. So we output the header and then the 96 rows.\n\n   But wait: the example input we were given had the header? And we are to output the next 96 dates. So we are not including the past data? only the forecast.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        header\n        row1\n        row2\n        ... row96\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning only the forecast? and the example input we were given had the header? So we include the header.\n\n   But note: the example input we were given was a block of data that included the header and then 96 rows. We are to output a similar block for the next 96 dates.\n\n   So:\n\n        <answer>\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n... (96 rows)\n2017-07-31 23:00:00   0.0\n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the last row of the provided data was 2017-07-27 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours are from 2017-07-28 00:00:00 to 2017-07-31 23:00:00.\n\n   because: \n        Day 1: 2017-07-28 (24 hours)\n        Day 2: 2017-07-29 (24 hours)\n        Day 3: 2017-07-30 (24 hours)\n        Day 4: 2017-07-31 (24 hours) -> 96 hours.\n\n   We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   Code for generating the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n        start = datetime(2017, 7, 28, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            date_str = current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            # then output\n\n   But note: we are not writing code, we are writing the output.\n\n   We'll write the output as:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 02:00:00   0.0\n... until\n2017-07-31 23:00:00   0.0\n\n   Exactly 96 rows.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we must write all 96 rows.\n\n   We cannot write ... in the actual output. We must write every row.\n\n   But the answer block must be text. We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"And your final answer must follow the format\", and the example format has:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ... (with the data)\n        \n        </answer>\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n... (all 96 rows)\n        </answer>\n\n   However, due to the length, we must generate the 96 rows.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we write all 96 rows.\n\n   Let's do it:\n\n        Line 1: \"               date  LULL\"\n        Line 2: \"2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\"\n        Line 3: \"2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\"\n        ...\n        Line 97: \"2017-07-31 23:00:00   0.0\"\n\n   Total 97 lines (1 header + 96 data rows).\n\n   But wait: the example input we were given had:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-24 00:00:00   0.0\n... (96 rows)\n\n   So we do the same.\n\n   However, the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 data points. So we output 96 data points, and the header is additional.\n\n   Therefore, we output 97 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete data\", and the header is part of the data representation.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n... (96 data rows)\n        </answer>\n\n   We'll generate the 96 data rows.\n\n   However, to avoid making the answer too long, we must write the entire 96 rows? The problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\".\n\n   So we write all 96 rows.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", so we do.\n\n   We generate:\n\n        header = \"               date  LULL\"\n        rows = []\n        start = datetime(2017, 28, 7, 0, 0, 0)  # wait, month and day: 7 is July, 28 is day? \n        Actually: datetime(2017, 7, day28) -> but the last date was 2017-07-27, so next day is 28.\n\n        Correction: \n            year=2017, month=7, day=28, hour=0, minute=0, second=0.\n\n        Then for i in range(96):\n            current = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            date_str = current.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            rows.append(f\"{date_str}   0.0\")\n\n   Then we output the header and then each row.\n\n   But note: the header has exactly the same string as the input? \n\n   We'll use: \"               date  LULL\" (with 15 spaces at the beginning?).\n\n   However, the example input had:\n\n        \"               date  LULL\"\n\n   We'll use that.\n\n   Now, we write the answer.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we write the entire 97 lines.\n\n   However, the answer block must be text. We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 02:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 03:00:00   0.0\n... (and so on)\n\n   We have to write 96 rows. We can do it manually? No, we are an AI, we can generate.\n\n   But in the response, we must write the entire 97 lines.\n\n   However, the character limit might be an issue? But the problem says we must.\n\n   We'll do it.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"And your final answer must follow the format\", and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\n\n   So we write:\n\n        <answer>\n               date  LULL\n2017-07-28 00:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 01:00:00   0.0\n2017-07-28 02:00:00   0.0\n...
