        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing time points, but we are warned that there might be missing values.\n    However, the given 96 records are consecutive and complete? Let's check: \n        From 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00 is exactly 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records. So the provided data is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must account for the possibility of seasonality and trends.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly, we can expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly patterns. However, we only have 4 days of data, which is not enough to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that can handle hourly data. Given the limited data, we might use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (if we assume additive or multiplicative seasonality)\n    - ARIMA/SARIMA (with seasonal component of 24)\n    - Or a simple method like using the average of the same hour in the past days (if we assume strong daily seasonality)\n\n 5. However, note that the data shows:\n    - A daily pattern: temperatures rise during the day and fall at night.\n    - But also, there is a drop on 2017-05-15 (especially at 13:00, 14:00, 15:00) that breaks the pattern? (e.g., 13:00 on 2017-05-15 is 12.662, which is lower than surrounding days)\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only forecasting 4 days (96 hours) ahead, we can try to use a simple seasonal model.\n\n 7. Approach: \n    We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 available days, and then adjust by the overall trend? \n    But note: the data is only 4 days, so we don't have a long-term trend. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-16) as a base and adjust by the average daily pattern?\n\n 8. However, the problem says there might be missing values. In the provided data we don't have missing values, but we are to be cautious.\n\n 9. Since we are required to provide the complete 96 forecasted points, we must generate 96 values.\n\n 10. We'll use a method that is robust and simple: \n     - We'll take the time series and decompose it into trend, seasonal, and residual. But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n      Forecast for hour h of day d (where d=5,6,7,8 for the next 4 days) is the average of the same hour h in the previous 4 days? \n      But note: the next 4 days are 2017-05-17 to 2017-05-20 (which are Thursday to Sunday? Let's check: 2017-05-13 is Saturday, so 14: Sun, 15: Mon, 16: Tue. Then 17: Wed, 18: Thu, 19: Fri, 20: Sat). \n      So we have two weekdays and two weekend days? But we only have one Saturday and one Sunday in the training.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the limited data, we might use a moving average for the same hour over the available days.\n\n 13. Steps for the forecast for hour i (i from 0 to 23) on the next day (2017-05-17) would be:\n     value = (OT at hour i on 2017-05-13 + OT at hour i on 2017-05-14 + OT at hour i on 2017-05-15 + OT at hour i on 2017-05-16) / 4\n\n 14. But note: the data on 2017-05-15 has an anomaly? We might use a median to be robust? However, the problem doesn't specify.\n\n 15. Since we are not given any instruction on the method, we choose a simple average per hour.\n\n 16. However, we must also consider that the temperature might have a trend? Looking at the data, the temperatures on 2017-05-16 are generally higher than on 2017-05-13? \n     Let's check the daily average:\n        2017-05-13: average = (16.954+16.883+...+20.612)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n        but note: the data has a peak at 24.059 and a low at 15.828 -> average around 18-19?\n        2017-05-14: similar but a bit lower? \n        2017-05-15: lower (because of the drop in the afternoon) -> average might be lower.\n        2017-05-16: higher again.\n\n     The overall trend is not clear. We might not have enough data for a trend.\n\n 17. We'll use the average per hour without trend adjustment.\n\n 18. How to handle the fact that the next days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday? We only have one Saturday (2017-05-13) and one Sunday (2017-05-14) in the training. \n     We don't have a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday in the training? Actually, 2017-05-15 is Monday, 2017-05-16 is Tuesday. \n     So the next days (17,18,19,20) are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n     We don't have corresponding weekdays for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So we cannot do a weekly seasonal model.\n\n 19. Therefore, we stick to daily seasonality (24-hour cycle) and average the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n 20. Algorithm:\n     For each hour in the day (0 to 23):\n        Let v0 = value at that hour on 2017-05-13\n        v1 = value at that hour on 2017-05-14\n        v2 = value at that hour on 2017-05-15\n        v3 = value at that hour on 2017-05-16\n\n        forecast for that hour on 2017-05-17 (Wednesday) = (v0+v1+v2+v3)/4\n        similarly for 2017-05-18 (Thursday), 2017-05-19 (Friday), 2017-05-20 (Saturday) we use the same value? \n\n     But that would give the same pattern for each of the next 4 days. \n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use a different approach: \n     We note that the time series might have a pattern that repeats daily, but the level of the day might change. \n     We can compute the daily average and then adjust the hourly pattern by the level of the day? \n\n     However, we don't have a way to forecast the daily level for the next 4 days. \n\n 22. Given the constraints, we will use the same daily pattern for the next 4 days, computed as the average of the 4 days.\n\n 23. Steps:\n     Let H = [0,1,...,23] (hours)\n     For each h in H:\n        avg_h = (OT_13[h] + OT_14[h] + OT_15[h] + OT_16[h]) / 4\n\n     Then the forecast for 2017-05-17 at hour h is avg_h, for 2017-05-18 at hour h is avg_h, and so on.\n\n 24. But note: the data on 2017-05-15 is lower. This might be because it was a Monday? But we don't have other Mondays. \n     Alternatively, we can use the median? \n\n 25. We'll use the average, but note that the problem says there might be missing values. In our training data we don't have missing values, so we can compute the average.\n\n 26. However, to be safe, we can also consider using the last day (2017-05-16) as the base and then adjust by the average daily pattern? \n     But without a clear trend, we stick to the average.\n\n 27. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (16.954000 + 20.471001 + 15.125000 + 13.436000) / 4 = (16.954+20.471+15.125+13.436)/4 = 66.0/4 = 16.5\n     Let me calculate: 16.954+20.471 = 37.425; 37.425+15.125=52.55; 52.55+13.436=65.986 -> 65.986/4 = 16.4965\n\n     We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. But note: the data has 3 decimal places? The given data has up to 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. However, the problem says the data might have missing values. Since we are not given any in the training, we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 30. We'll compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n 31. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 32. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (16.954, 20.471, 15.125, 13.436) -> 16.4965 -> 16.497\n     Hour 1: (16.883, 20.119, 14.280, 13.436) -> (16.883+20.119=37.002; 37.002+14.280=51.282; 51.282+13.436=64.718) -> 64.718/4=16.1795 -> 16.180\n     Hour 2: (15.828, 17.516, 13.718, 13.929) -> (15.828+17.516=33.344; 33.344+13.718=47.062; 47.062+13.929=60.991) -> 60.991/4=15.24775 -> 15.248\n     Hour 3: (15.898, 16.461, 13.507, 13.929) -> (15.898+16.461=32.359; 32.359+13.507=45.866; 45.866+13.929=59.795) -> 59.795/4=14.94875 -> 14.949\n     Hour 4: (16.039, 15.828, 13.296, 13.155) -> (16.039+15.828=31.867; 31.867+13.296=45.163; 45.163+13.155=58.318) -> 58.318/4=14.5795 -> 14.580\n     Hour 5: (15.898, 15.687, 13.436, 13.366) -> (15.898+15.687=31.585; 31.585+13.436=45.021; 45.021+13366=58.387) -> 58.387/4=14.59675 -> 14.597\n     Hour 6: (16.250, 16.461, 14.491, 13.225) -> (16.250+16.461=32.711; 32.711+14.491=47.202; 47.202+13.225=60.427) -> 60.427/4=15.10675 -> 15.107\n     Hour 7: (17.235, 16.813, 15.265, 13.929) -> (17.235+16.813=34.048; 34.048+15.265=49.313; 49.313+13.929=63.242) -> 63.242/4=15.8105 -> 15.811\n     Hour 8: (18.642, 17.235, 15.547, 14.914) -> (18.642+17.235=35.877; 35.877+15.547=51.424; 51.424+14.914=66.338) -> 66.338/4=16.5845 -> 16.585\n     Hour 9: (17.024, 17.024, 14.703, 14.703) -> (17.024+17.024=34.048; 34.048+14.703=48.751; 48.751+14.703=63.454) -> 63.454/4=15.8635 -> 15.864\n     Hour 10: (16.602, 17.938, 14.562, 14.984) -> (16.602+17.938=34.540; 34.540+14.562=49.102; 49.102+14.984=64.086) -> 64.086/4=16.0215 -> 16.022\n     Hour 11: (18.220, 18.431, 15.687, 16.039) -> (18.220+18.431=36.651; 36.651+15.687=52.338; 52.338+16.039=68.377) -> 68.377/4=17.09425 -> 17.094\n     Hour 12: (18.290, 18.572, 17.235, 16.461) -> (18.290+18.572=36.862; 36.862+17.235=54.097; 54.097+16.461=70.558) -> 70.558/4=17.6395 -> 17.640\n     Hour 13: (20.541, 18.853, 12.662, 17.657) -> (20.541+18.853=39.394; 39.394+12.662=52.056; 52.056+17.657=69.713) -> 69.713/4=17.42825 -> 17.428\n     Hour 14: (21.174, 19.275, 14.632, 19.627) -> (21.174+19.275=40.449; 40.449+14.632=55.081; 55.081+19.627=74.708) -> 74.708/4=18.677 -> 18.677\n     Hour 15: (23.848, 19.064, 13.085, 20.823) -> (23.848+19.064=42.912; 42.912+13.085=55.997; 55.997+20.823=76.82) -> 76.82/4=19.205 -> 19.205\n     Hour 16: (23.918, 18.009, 16.109, 21.878) -> (23.918+18.009=41.927; 41.927+16.109=58.036; 58.036+21.878=79.914) -> 79.914/4=19.9785 -> 19.979\n     Hour 17: (24.059, 17.165, 14.703, 20.823) -> (24.059+17.165=41.224; 41.224+14.703=55.927; 55.927+20.823=76.75) -> 76.75/4=19.1875 -> 19.188\n     Hour 18: (23.918, 15.969, 14.843, 20.541) -> (23.918+15.969=39.887; 39.887+14.843=54.73; 54.73+20.541=75.271) -> 75.271/4=18.81775 -> 18.818\n     Hour 19: (22.159, 15.969, 13.999, 18.501) -> (22.159+15.969=38.128; 38.128+13.999=52.127; 52.127+18.501=70.628) -> 70.628/4=17.657 -> 17.657\n     Hour 20: (21.034, 16.461, 13.296, 18.923) -> (21.034+16.461=37.495; 37.495+13.296=50.791; 50.791+18.923=69.714) -> 69.714/4=17.4285 -> 17.429\n     Hour 21: (21.526, 16.180, 13.014, 18.642) -> (21.526+16.180=37.706; 37.706+13.014=50.72; 50.72+18.642=69.362) -> 69.362/4=17.3405 -> 17.341\n     Hour 22: (20.823, 15.758, 13.085, 18.220) -> (20.823+15.758=36.581; 36.581+13.085=49.666; 49.666+18.220=67.886) -> 67.886/4=16.9715 -> 16.972\n     Hour 23: (20.612, 15.898, 12.944, 18.150) -> (20.612+15.898=36.510; 36.510+12.944=49.454; 49.454+18.150=67.604) -> 67.604/4=16.901 -> 16.901\n\n 33.

Note: This is a simple method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models, but given the constraints (only 4 days of data) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 44.

We must be cautious: the computed averages are rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. Let's write the 24 average values we computed:\n\n        hour0: 16.497\n        hour1: 16.180\n        hour2: 15.248\n        hour3: 14.949\n        hour4: 14.580\n        hour5: 14.597\n        hour6: 15.107\n        hour7: 15.811\n        hour8: 16.585\n        hour9: 15.864\n        hour10: 16.022\n        hour11: 17.094\n        hour12: 17.640\n        hour13: 17.428\n        hour14: 18.677\n        hour15: 19.205\n        hour16: 19.979\n        hour17: 19.188\n        hour18: 18.818\n        hour19: 17.657\n        hour20: 17.429\n        hour21: 17.341\n        hour22: 16.972\n        hour23: 16.901\n\n 47.
