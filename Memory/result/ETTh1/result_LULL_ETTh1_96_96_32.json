        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points ahead. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 consecutive hourly timestamps.\n\n 3. We note that the data is for \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) and shows a pattern that might be daily (24-hour) seasonality.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that handles seasonality. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a simple seasonal model.\n\n 5. However, note that the data has a clear daily pattern: values are more negative during the night and less negative (or closer to zero) during the day.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    - We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then use that to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 7. But note: the data does not be stationary? We see that the level of the time series might be changing. For example, the values on 2016-11-09 are generally more negative than the previous days.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 9. Given the constraints (only 96 points and 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days, we can do:\n\n    Option A: Seasonal Naive - use the last complete season (last 24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But the level is changing.\n\n    Option B: We can adjust the level by taking the average of the last 24 hours and then use the daily pattern from the entire history.\n\n 10. Let's try:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the daily average for each day (from day1 to day4) and then the overall average for each hour of the day.\n\n     Step 2: We note that the level of the time series is decreasing (becoming more negative) over the 4 days. We can fit a linear trend to the daily averages and project that trend for the next 4 days.\n\n     Step 3: Then, for each hour in the next 4 days, we take the projected daily average and add the seasonal deviation (from the overall hourly pattern).\n\n 11. However, we must be cautious because we only have 4 days.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use Holt-Winters exponential smoothing with additive seasonality. But we have only 4 days (one cycle of 24 hours repeated 4 times) which is minimal for seasonal models.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are required to provide a forecast, we will:\n\n     a) Compute the hourly seasonal indices (over the 4 days) by averaging each hour of the day.\n\n        Let H_i (for i in 0..23) be the average of the values at hour i across the 4 days.\n\n     b) We then compute the overall average of the entire 96 points, call it M.\n\n        Then the seasonal indices (deviations) can be: s_i = H_i - M.\n\n     c) But we see a trend? Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2016-11-06): average of 24 points: let's call it D1\n        Day2: D2\n        Day3: D3\n        Day4: D4\n\n        We can fit a linear regression: D_t = a + b * t, for t=1,2,3,4.\n\n        Then for the next days (t=5,6,7,8) we get D5, D6, D7, D8.\n\n     d) Then the forecast for hour i in day t (where t=5,6,7,8) is:\n\n        F_{t,i} = D_t + s_i\n\n     e) But note: the seasonal indices s_i were computed relative to the overall mean M. We can also adjust by using the daily average D_t and then add the seasonal deviation relative to the daily average? Actually, the standard way is:\n\n        We can compute the seasonal indices as the average of the ratios (if multiplicative) or differences (if additive) of the data points to the daily average.\n\n        Since the data are negative, multiplicative might not be suitable. So we use additive.\n\n        How to compute additive seasonal indices:\n\n          For each day d and hour i, we have the value x_{d,i}. We compute the daily average for day d, say A_d.\n\n          Then the deviation for that hour in that day is: x_{d,i} - A_d.\n\n          Then for each hour i, we average the deviations over the 4 days: s_i = average_{d=1 to 4} (x_{d,i} - A_d)\n\n        Then the forecast for a future day d' and hour i is: \n            F_{d',i} = A_{d'} + s_i\n\n        But we don't have A_{d'} (the daily average for the future day). So we need to forecast the daily average for the next 4 days.\n\n        We can use the linear trend on the past daily averages: A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4.\n\n        Then A_5} = a + b*5, A_6 = a + b*6, etc.\n\n 14. Steps in detail:\n\n     Step 1: Reshape the data into days (4 days, each 24 hours).\n\n        day0: 2016-11-06 -> index 0 to 23\n        day1: 2016-11-07 -> index 24 to 47\n        day2: 2016-11-08 -> index 48 to 71\n        day3: 2016-11-09 -> index 72 to 95\n\n     Step 2: Compute daily averages:\n\n        A0 = mean of day0\n        A1 = mean of day1\n        A2 = mean of day2\n        A3 = mean of day3\n\n     Step 3: For each hour i (0-23), compute the deviation for each day:\n\n        For hour i in day0: dev0_i = value0_i - A0\n        For hour i in day1: dev1_i = value1_i - A1\n        For hour i in day2: dev2_i = value2_i - A2\n        For hour i in day3: dev3_i = value3_i - A3\n\n        Then s_i = (dev0_i + dev1_i + dev2_i + dev3_i) / 4\n\n     Step 4: Fit a linear model to the daily averages [A0, A1, A2, A3] over time [0,1,2,3].\n\n        Let t = [0,1,2,3] and A = [A0, A1, A2, A3]\n\n        We fit: A_t = intercept + slope * t\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (t=4,5,6,7) we compute:\n\n        A4 = intercept + slope * 4\n        A5 = intercept + slope * 5\n        A6 = intercept + slope * 6\n        A7 = intercept + slope * 7\n\n     Step 5: For each future day (from day4 to day7, which correspond to 2016-11-10 to 2016-11-13) and for each hour i in [0,23]:\n\n        F_{day4, i} = A4 + s_i\n        F_{day5, i} = A5 + s_i\n        F_{day6, i} = A6 + s_i\n        F_{day7, i} = A7 + s_i\n\n     Step 6: Generate the timestamps for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-11-09 23:00:00).\n\n 15. Implementation:\n\n     First, let's compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day0 (2016-11-06): indices 0 to 23\n        data: \n            [-0.975, -1.127, -1.127, -1.127, -1.097, -1.127, -1.097, -0.914, -0.609, -0.640, -0.731, -0.822, -0.853, -0.701, -0.761, -0.944, -0.853, -0.761, -0.883, -1.036, -0.944, -1.036, -1.036, -1.066]\n\n        A0 = sum / 24 = ?\n\n        Let me calculate:\n\n        We can do: \n          A0 = (-0.975 -1.127*3 -1.097*2 -0.914 -0.609 -0.640 -0.731 -0.822 -0.853 -0.701 -0.761 -0.944 -0.853 -0.761 -0.883 -1.036 -0.944 -1.036*2 -1.066) / 24\n\n        Alternatively, we can use code, but since we are doing by hand, we can approximate.\n\n        Actually, we are going to write a program to do it? But we are an AI, so we can compute.\n\n        Let me compute step by step:\n\n          -0.975\n          -1.127 * 3 = -3.381\n          -1.097 * 2 = -2.194\n          -0.914\n          -0.609\n          -0.640\n          -0.731\n          -0.822\n          -0.853\n          -0.701\n          -0.761\n          -0.944\n          -0.853\n          -0.761\n          -0.883\n          -1.036\n          -0.944\n          -1.036 * 2 = -2.072\n          -1.066\n\n        Now sum:\n\n          = -0.975 -3.381 -2.194 -0.914 -0.609 -0.640 -0.731 -0.822 -0.853 -0.701 -0.761 -0.944 -0.853 -0.761 -0.883 -1.036 -0.944 -2.072 -1.066\n\n        Let me add in groups:\n\n          -0.975 -3.381 = -4.356\n          -4.356 -2.194 = -6.55\n          -6.55 -0.914 = -7.464\n          -7.464 -0.609 = -8.073\n          -8.073 -0.640 = -8.713\n          -8.713 -0.731 = -9.444\n          -9.444 -0.822 = -10.266\n          -10.266 -0.853 = -11.119\n          -11.119 -0.701 = -11.82\n          -11.82 -0.761 = -12.581\n          -12.581 -0.944 = -13.525\n          -13.525 -0.853 = -14.378\n          -14.378 -0.761 = -15.139\n          -15.139 -0.883 = -16.022\n          -16.022 -1.036 = -17.058\n          -17.058 -0.944 = -18.002\n          -18.002 -2.072 = -20.074\n          -20.074 -1.066 = -21.14\n\n        Then A0 = -21.14 / 24 = -0.880833\n\n        Similarly, we do for the other days? This is tedious. We are an AI, so we can simulate the calculation.\n\n        But note: we are to provide a forecast, so we can do the daily averages by code in our mind.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: since the data is small, we can use the last 24 hours as the pattern and adjust by the trend.\n\n        However, we are going to do the method we described.\n\n        Let me do it in a more efficient way:\n\n        We have the data in a list:\n\n        day0 = [-0.975, -1.127, -1.127, -1.127, -1.097, -1.127, -1.097, -0.914, -0.609, -0.640, -0.731, -0.822, -0.853, -0.701, -0.761, -0.944, -0.853, -0.761, -0.883, -1.036, -0.944, -1.036, -1.036, -1.066]\n\n        A0 = sum(day0)/24 = -21.14 / 24 = -0.880833\n\n        day1 = [-0.518, -0.548, -0.518, -0.579, -0.579, -0.548, -0.426, -0.366, -0.731, -0.853, -0.761, -0.914, -0.975, -0.822, -0.944, -0.975, -1.066, -1.066, -1.097, -1.097, -1.097, -1.157, -1.097, -1.157]\n\n        Let me compute the sum for day1:\n\n          -0.518 -0.548 -0.518 -0.579 -0.579 -0.548 -0.426 -0.366 -0.731 -0.853 -0.761 -0.914 -0.975 -0.822 -0.944 -0.975 -1.066 -1.066 -1.097 -1.097 -1.097 -1.157 -1.097 -1.157\n\n        We can group:\n\n          The first 8: \n            -0.518*2 = -1.036, -0.548*2 = -1.096, -0.579*2 = -1.158, -0.426, -0.366 -> total = -1.036-1.096-1.158-0.426-0.366 = -4.082\n          Then: \n            -0.731, -0.853, -0.761, -2.345\n            -0.914, -0.975, -0.822 -> -2.711\n            -0.944, -0.975 -> -1.919\n            -1.066*2 = -2.132\n            -1.097*3 = -3.291\n            -1.157*2 = -2.314\n            and one more -1.097? Actually, we have 24 points.\n\n          Actually, we have 24 numbers. Let me list:\n\n          We have: \n            [0: -0.518, 1: -0.548, 2: -0.518, 3: -0.579, 4: -0.579, 5: -0.548, 6: -0.426, 7: -0.366, \n             8: -0.731, 9: -0.853, 10: -0.761, 11: -0.914, 12: -0.975, 13: -0.822, 14: -0.944, 15: -0.975, \n16: -1.066, 17: -1.066, 18: -1.097, 19: -1.097, 20: -1.097, 21: -1.157, 22: -1.097, 23: -1.157]\n\n          So: \n            -0.518*2 = -1.036\n            -0.548*2 = -1.096\n            -0.579*2 = -1.158\n            -0.426, -0.366 -> -0.792\n            -0.731, -0.853, -1.584\n            -0.761, -0.914, -1.675\n            -0.975, -0.822, -1.797\n            -0.944, -0.975, -1.919\n            -1.066*2 = -2.132\n            -1.097*3 = -3.291 (positions 18,19,20)\n            -1.157*2 = -2.314 (positions 21,23) and position 22 is -1.097 -> so that's 4 times -1.097? \n            Actually, positions 18,19,20,22: that's 4 times? But wait, position 22 is the 23rd element? \n\n          Correction: \n            positions 18,19,20: three times -1.097, and then position 22 is the fourth? But we have 24 elements.\n\n          Actually, we have:\n            positions 18: -1.097\n            positions 19: -1.097\n            positions 20: -1.097\n            positions 22: -1.097 -> that's four? But then position 21 and 23 are -1.157.\n\n          So: \n            -1.097 * 4 = -4.388\n            and -1.157 * 2 = -2.314\n\n          Now let's add all:\n\n            -1.036 (for two -0.518)\n            -1.096 (for two -0.548)\n            -1.158 (for two -0.579)\n            -0.426 (one) and -0.366 (one) -> -0.792\n            -0.731, -0.853 -> -1.584\n            -0.761, -0.914 -> -1.675\n            -0.975, -0.822 -> -1.797\n            -0.944, -0.975 -> -1.919\n            -1.066*2 = -2.132\n            -1.097*4 = -4.388\n            -1.157*2 = -2.314\n\n          Now sum these groups:\n\n            = -1.036 -1.096 -1.158 -0.792 -1.584 -1.675 -1.797 -1.919 -2.132 -4.388 -2.314\n\n          Step by step:\n\n            -1.036 -1.096 = -2.132\n            -2.132 -1.158 = -3.29\n            -3.29 -0.792 = -4.082\n            -4.082 -1.584 = -5.666\n            -5.666 -1.675 = -7.341\n            -7.341 -1.797 = -9.138\n            -9.138 -1.919 = -11.057\n            -11.057 -2.132 = -13.189\n            -13.189 -4.388 = -17.577\n            -17.577 -2.314 = -19.891\n\n          Then A1 = -19.891 / 24 = -0.82879\n\n        Similarly, we do for day2 and day3? This is very time-consuming.\n\n        We are an AI, so we can do it quickly.

But we are to provide a forecast without running code.\n\n        Given the complexity, we might use a simpler model: use the last 24 hours as the pattern and adjust by the overall trend.\n\n        However, we are going to stick to the plan and do the calculations.\n\n        We'll compute the daily averages for the 4 days:\n\n          Day0: A0 = -0.880833\n          Day1: A1 = -19.891/24 = -0.82879 (approx -0.829)\n\n        Day2: \n          data: \n          [-1.066, -1.066, -1.097, -1.097, -1.097, -1.005, -0.975, -0.975, -0.640, -0.609, -0.518, -0.579, -0.761, -0.731, -0.609, -0.579, -0.609, -0.670, -0.853, -1.005, -1.066, -1.097, -1.097, -1.371]\n\n          Let me compute the sum:\n\n            -1.066*2 = -2.132\n            -1.097*3 = -3.291\n            -1.005, -0.975*2 = -1.005 -1.95 = -2.955\n            -0.640, -0.609, -0.518, -0.579 -> -0.640-0.609-0.518-0.579 = -2.346\n            -0.761, -0.731, -0.609, -0.579 -> -0.761-0.731-0.609-0.579 = -2.68\n            -0.609, -0.670 -> -1.279\n            -0.853, -1.005 -> -1.858\n            -1.066, -1.097*2 = -1.066 -2.194 = -3.26\n            -1.371\n\n          Now add:\n\n            -2.132 -3.291 = -5.423\n            -5.423 -2.955 = -8.378\n            -8.378 -2.346 = -10.724\n            -10.724 -2.68 = -13.404\n            -13.404 -1.279 = -14.683\n            -14.683 -1.858 = -16.541\n            -16.541 -3.26 = -19.801\n            -19.801 -1.371 = -21.172\n\n          A2 = -21.172 / 24 = -0.8821667\n\n        Day3:\n          data: \n          [-0.975, -1.036, -0.975, -1.036, -0.975, -0.853, -0.883, -0.761, -1.066, -1.157, -1.127, -1.157, -1.340, -0.792, -0.853, -0.975, -0.883, -0.548, -0.944, -1.066, -1.097, -1.127, -1.097, -1.066]\n\n          Sum:\n\n            -0.975, -1.036, -0.975, -1.036, -0.975 -> 5 values: \n                -0.975*3 = -2.925, -1.036*2 = -2.072 -> total = -4.997\n            -0.853, -0.883, -0.761 -> -0.853-0.883-0.761 = -2.497\n            -1.066, -1.157, -1.127, -1.157 -> -1.066-1.157-1.127-1.157 = -4.507\n            -1.340, -0.792 -> -2.132\n            -0.853, -0.975 -> -1.828\n            note: we have -0.853 again?

This is very long, but we are an AI, so we can do it.\n\n        However, given the time and complexity, and that this is a text-based response, we will provide a forecast using the last 24 hours and adjust by the trend.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the overall seasonal pattern from the entire data without detrending? \n\n        Given the time, we decide to use a simpler method: \n\n          We observe that the data has a daily seasonality and a downward trend. We will use the last 24 hours (day3) as the base pattern, and then shift it down by the average daily decrease.\n\n        The daily averages: \n          A0=-0.8808, A1=-0.8288, A2=-0.8822, A3=-0.9912\n\n        The average daily change: (A3 - A0)/3 = (-0.9912+0.8808)/3 = (-0.1104)/3 = -0.0368\n\n        So for the next 4 days, we expect the daily average to decrease by about 0.0368 per day.\n\n        Then for day4 (t=4), we set the base = A3 -0.0368 = -0.9912 -0.0368 = -1.028\n        day5: -1.028 -0.0368 = -1.0648\n        day6: -1.0648 -0.0368 = -1.1016\n        day7: -1.1016 -0.0368 = -1.1384\n\n        Then for each hour in day4, we take the value from the same hour in day3 and add the difference in level between day4 and day3.\n\n        Specifically, for hour i in day4: \n          F_i = (value of hour i in day3) + (base4 - A3) \n               = value_i_day3 + (-1.028 - (-0.9912)) = value_i_day3 -0.0368\n\n        Similarly, for day5: F_i = value_i_day3 -0.0368*2\n        day6: value_i_day3 -0.0368*3\n        day7: value_i_day3 -0.0368*4\n\n        But wait, we can also use the daily average adjustment.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the seasonal pattern from the last day and then adjust the level by the new daily average.\n\n        However, we already have the last day (day3) data. So for the next 24 hours (day4), we can use:\n\n          F_i = value_i_day3 + (A4 - A3)   [where A4 is the forecasted daily average for day4]\n\n        We forecasted A4 = -1.028 (by the average daily change) and A3 = -0.9912, so difference = -0.0368.\n\n        So F_i = value_i_day3 - 0.0368\n\n        For day5: F_i = value_i_day3 - 0.0368*2\n        For day6: F_i = value_i_day3 - 0.0368*3\n        For day7: F_i = value_i_day3 - 0.0368*4\n\n        But note: the daily average of the forecast for day4 should be around -1.028. Let's check for day4:\n\n          average of day4 forecast = average of (value_i_day3 - 0.0368) = A3 - 0.0368 = -0.9912 -0.0368 = -1.028 -> matches.\n\n        So we use the last 24 hours (day3) as the base and subtract 0.0368 for each subsequent day.\n\n        The last 24 hours (day3) are:\n\n          hour0: -0.975\n          hour1: -1.036\n          hour2: -0.975\n          hour3: -1.036\n          hour4: -0.975\n          hour5: -0.853\n          hour6: -0.883\n          hour7: -0.761\n          hour8: -1.066\n          hour9: -1.157\n          hour10: -1.127\n          hour11: -1.157\n          hour12: -1.340\n          hour13: -0.792\n          hour14: -0.853\n          hour15: -0.975\n          hour16: -0.883\n          hour17: -0.548\n          hour18: -0.944\n          hour19: -1.066\n          hour20: -1.097\n          hour21: -1.127\n          hour22: -1.097\n          hour23: -1.066\n\n        Then for the next 96 hours:\n\n          Day4 (2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-10 23:00:00): \n            00:00: -0.975 - 0.0368 = -1.0118\n            01:00: -1.036 - 0.0368 = -1.0728\n            02:00: -0.975 - 0.0368 = -1.0118\n            ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n          Day5: subtract 0.0368*2 = 0.0736 from the base (day3)\n          Day6: subtract 0.0368*3 = 0.1104\n          Day7: subtract 0.0368*4 = 0.1472\n\n        We generate the dates:\n\n          Start: 2016-11-10 00:00:00 (next after 2016-11-09 23:00:00)\n\n        We'll provide the data in the required format.\n\n        But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n        Example for the first few hours of day4:\n\n          2016-11-10 00:00:00: -0.975 - 0.0368 = -1.0118 -> -1.012\n          2016-11-10 01:00:00: -1.036 - 0.0368 = -1.0728 -> -1.073\n          2016-11-10 02:00:00: -0.975 - 0.0368 = -1.0118 -> -1.012\n          2016-11-10 03:00:00: -1.036 - 0.0368 = -1.0728 -> -1.073\n          2016-11-10 04:00:00: -0.975 - 0.0368 = -1.0118 -> -1.012\n          2016-11-10 05:00:00: -0.853 - 0.0368 = -0.8898 -> -0.890\n          2016-11-10 06:00:00: -0.883 - 0.0368 = -0.9198 -> -0.920\n          2016-11-10 07:00:00: -0.761 - 0.0368 = -0.7978 -> -0.798\n          ...\n\n        We do this for 24 hours for day4, then for day5 we subtract 0.0736, etc.\n\n        Let's do it for all 96 hours.\n\n        We are to provide the complete data.\n\n        Given the length, we will generate the data in the answer format.\n\n        But note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes, but here it is hourly.\n\n        We are to output 96 lines.\n\n        We'll generate the dates:\n\n          start = pd.Timestamp('2016-11-10 00:00:00')\n          then add hours.\n\n        We'll create a list for the next 96 hours.\n\n        We'll use the last 24 values (day3) as the base and then for each day in the next 4 days, we subtract 0.0368 * (day_index) where day_index=1,2,3,4.\n\n        Actually, for the first 24 hours (day4) we use multiplier=1, then day5 multiplier=2, etc.\n\n        So:\n\n          for i in range(0, 24):\n             date = start + i * timedelta(hours=1)\n             value = base_day3[i] - 0.0368 * 1   # for day4\n\n          for i in range(24, 48):\n             value = base_day3[i-24] - 0.0368 * 2   # for day5\n\n          for i in range(48, 72):\n             value = base_day3[i-48] - 0.0368 * 3   # for day6\n\n          for i in range(72, 96):\n             value = base_day3[i-72] - 0.0368 * 4   # for day7\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Let's do it.\n\n        Base_day3 (the last 24 hours given) in order:\n\n          [ -0.975, -1.036, -0.975, -1.036, -0.975, -0.853, -0.883, -0.761, -1.066, -1.157, -1.127, -1.157, -1.340, -0.792, -0.853, -0.975, -0.883, -0.548, -0.944, -1.066, -1.097, -1.127, -1.097, -1.066 ]\n\n        We'll generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n        We must output in the format:\n\n          <answer>\n          date   LULL\n          2016-11-10 00:00:00 -1.012\n          2016-11-10 01:00:00 -1.073\n          ... \n\n        We are ready.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 there are none, and we are forecasting without missing values.\n\n        We'll provide the forecast.\n\n        Let's hope this method is acceptable.\n\n        We are using: \n          base_pattern = the last 24 hours (day3)\n          trend = -0.0368 per day (constant decrement)\n\n        This is a simple and quick method.\n\n        We generate the next 96 points.\n\n        We'll write the answer accordingly.\n",
