        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided segment, there are no missing values. However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (4 days).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n However, note: The problem states that the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n We are to forecast the next 96 points without any gaps.\n\n Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models, but we can use a simple method to generate a forecast.\n\n We can use:\n   - Seasonal decomposition: The data shows a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can model the trend and seasonality.\n\n But note: We only have 4 days of data. This is very limited.\n\n Alternative: Use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more robust method if possible.\n\n Since we are limited in computation here, we can use:\n   - A seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? \n     But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n But note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last day (2016-09-10) has lower temperatures than the previous days? \n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n However, without being able to run a full model, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Check for seasonality: We have 4 days, so we can compute the average daily pattern.\n\n   Step 2: Check for trend: We can compute the average temperature for each day and see if there is a trend.\n\n   Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n     2016-09-07: average = (18.009001 + ... + 22.580999) / 24 -> we can compute roughly: \n        but we don't need exact, we can see the overall.\n\n     Actually, we can see the data: \n        Day1 (07): starts at 18.0, peaks at 25.958, ends at 22.58\n        Day2 (08): starts at 22.01, peaks at 27.927, ends at 24.12\n        Day3 (09): starts at 24.69, peaks at 29.61, ends at 25.88\n        Day4 (10): starts at 26.23, peaks at 28.27, ends at 24.27\n\n     The daily average might be increasing? But then the last day (10) has a lower peak? \n\n     Alternatively, we can compute the mean for each day:\n\n        Day1: mean = (18.009001 + 18.29 + ... + 22.580999) / 24\n        We can approximate: the values are between 18 and 26 -> let's say around 22.\n\n        But without exact calculation, we can see the trend is not clear.\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are limited, we can use a simple method:\n\n   We will use the last day (2016-09-10) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day to the next.\n\n   However, we have 4 days. We can compute the average daily pattern and then project the last day's pattern with a slight adjustment.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let H be the hour (0 to 23).\n\n   For each hour H, we have 4 observations: \n        d1 = value at H on 2016-09-07\n        d2 = value at H on 2016-09-08\n        d3 = value at H on 2016-09-09\n        d4 = value at H on 2016-09-10\n\n   We can compute the average for each hour: \n        avg_H = (d1 + d2 + d3 + d4) / 4\n\n   But that would ignore any trend? \n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the average of the last two days? \n\n   However, the problem requires 96 points. We can also consider using a) the average daily pattern and b) the overall level of the last day.\n\n   Method: \n        Let base = the last day (2016-09-10) \n        Then for the next day (2016-09-11), we can use the same pattern as the base but adjusted by the average change from the previous days.\n\n   But we don't have a clear trend. \n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n        That would be 96 points: \n            For the first 24 hours (2016-09-11): use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days.\n            Then for the next 24 hours (2016-09-12): same, but we don't have more data? \n\n   But note: we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days). We can use the same pattern for all 4 days? \n\n   However, that would be constant for each hour across the 4 days? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average daily pattern and then add a linear trend component? \n\n   We can compute the overall trend by fitting a linear regression to the entire 96 points? \n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Assign a time index: t = 0 to 95.\n   2. Fit a linear model: OT = a + b*t\n   3. Then for the next 96 points (t=96 to 191), we can compute the trend component: OT_trend = a + b*t\n\n   4. Then we remove the trend from the historical data to get the detrended series.\n   5. Then we compute the daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) from the detrended data.\n\n      How? We can average the detrended data for each hour of the day.\n\n   6. Then the forecast for a future time t (which is in the next 96) is:\n          forecast(t) = (a + b*t) + seasonal_component[hour(t)]\n\n   But we only have 4 days, so the seasonal component is the average of 4 points for each hour.\n\n   However, the trend might not be linear? \n\n   Let's try to compute the linear trend:\n\n        We have 96 points. We can compute the linear regression.\n\n        But note: the data has a clear daily cycle, so we must account for seasonality.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average to smooth the trend? \n\n   Given the time constraints, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the daily average for the 4 days:\n\n            Day1: 2016-09-07: let S1 = average of the 24 points\n            Day2: S2, Day3: S3, Day4: S4.\n\n        Step 2: Fit a linear trend to these 4 points: \n            time: d=0,1,2,3 for the 4 days.\n            S = c + d * day_index\n\n        Step 3: Then the trend for the next 4 days (day_index=4,5,6,7) would be: \n            S5 = c + d*4\n            S6 = c + d*5\n            S7 = c + d*6\n            S8 = c + d*7\n\n        Step 4: Then for each hour in a day, we have a seasonal index. We can compute the seasonal factors for each hour by:\n\n            For hour H (0-23):\n                F_H = ( (d1_H - S1) + (d2_H - S2) + (d3_H - S3) + (d4_H - S4) ) / 4\n\n        Step 5: Then the forecast for a future day_index (say day 4, which is 2016-09-11) at hour H is:\n                forecast = S5 + F_H\n\n        Similarly, for day5 (2016-09-12): forecast = S6 + F_H, etc.\n\n   This method is called: classical decomposition with additive model.\n\n   However, note: the decomposition model we are using is additive. We assume:\n        OT = trend + seasonality + noise\n\n   We are ignoring the noise and using the average seasonal factor.\n\n   Steps in detail:\n\n        Let's denote:\n            days = [0,1,2,3] for the four days we have.\n            daily_means = [S1, S2, S3, S4]\n\n        Fit a linear regression: S = c + d * day_index\n\n        Then for the next four days (day_index = 4,5,6,7) we get the daily means: [S5, S6, S7, S8]\n\n        Then for each hour H in [0,23]:\n            seasonal_factor[H] = ( (OT_{day1,H} - S1) + (OT_{day2,H} - S2) + (OT_{day3,H} - S3) + (OT_{day4,H} - S4) ) / 4\n\n        Then for a future day D (which is one of 4,5,6,7) and hour H:\n            forecast = (c + d * D) + seasonal_factor[H]\n\n   But note: the day_index for the next days: \n        Day 4: 2016-09-11\n        Day 5: 2016-09-12\n        Day 6: 2016-09-13\n        Day 7: 2016-09-14\n\n   We have to generate 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Step 1: Compute daily means for the 4 days.\n\n        Step 2: Fit a linear regression to the daily means.\n\n        Step 3: Compute the seasonal factors for each hour (0-23).\n\n        Step 4: For each of the next 4 days (day_index=4,5,6,7) and for each hour in that day (0-23):\n                daily_mean = c + d * day_index\n                forecast = daily_mean + seasonal_factor[hour]\n\n        Step 5: Format the dates: \n                The last date in the given data is 2016-09-10 23:00:00.\n                The next date is 2016-09-11 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n   Let's do the calculations:\n\n        Step 1: Compute daily means.\n\n        We have the data in 24-hour blocks:\n\n        Day0 (2016-09-07): \n            values = [18.009001, 18.290001,

   day6 (2016-09-13): 22.26019 + 1.52239*6 = 22.26019 + 9.13434 = 31.39453\n            day7 (2016-09-14): 22.26019 + 1.52239*7 = 22.26019 + 10.65673 = 32.91692\n\n        Step 3: Compute seasonal factors for each hour (0-23).\n\n            For hour0 (00:00:00):\n                d0: 18.009001 -> deviation = 18.009001 - 21.5554583333 = -3.5464573333\n                d1: 22.018999 -> 22.018999 - 24.3928749583 = -2.3738759583\n                d2: 24.691999 -> 24.691999 - 26.1984167917 = -1.5064177917\n                d3: 26.239000 -> 26.239000 - 26.0282916667 = 0.2107083333\n\n                average = (-3.5464573333 -2.3738759583 -1.5064177917 + 0.2107083333) / 4 = (-7.21604275) / 4 = -1.8040106875\n\n            Similarly, we do for all 24.\n\n        We can do this for all 24 hours.\n\n        Step 4: For each day in the future (day4, day5, day6, day7) and for each hour in 0-23:\n\n                forecast = daily_mean(day) + seasonal_factor[hour]\n\n        Example for 2016-09-11 00:00:00 (day4, hour0): \n                forecast = 28.34975 + (-1.8040106875) = 26.5457393125\n\n        We'll do this for all.\n\n   However, note: the linear trend we fitted is increasing, but the last day (day3) was 26.028 and the next day (day4) is 28.349? \n        That seems a big jump. \n\n   Let me check the linear regression: \n        day0: 22.26019 + 0 = 22.26019 (but actual was 21.5555) -> residual = -0.70469\n        day1: 22.26019+1.52239 = 23.78258 (actual 24.3929) -> residual = 0.61032\n        day2: 22.26019+3.04478 = 25.30497 (actual 26.1984) -> residual = 0.89343\n        day3: 22.26019+4.56717 = 26.82736 (actual 26.0283) -> residual = -0.79906\n\n   The model doesn't fit perfectly, but we are extrapolating.\n\n   Alternatively, we might consider using only the last two days for the trend? \n\n   But the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the forecast.\n\n   We'll proceed with the above method.\n\n   We'll compute the seasonal factors for all 24 hours.\n\n   Let me do a few more hours to see the pattern.\n\n   Hour1 (01:00:00):\n        d0: 18.290001 - 21.5554583333 = -3.2654573333\n        d1: 22.159000 - 24.3928749583 = -2.2338749583\n        d2: 24.270000 - 26.1984167917 = -1.9284167917\n        d3: 25.747000 - 26.0282916667 = -0.2812916667\n        average = (-3.2654573333 -2.2338749583 -1.9284167917 -0.2812916667)/4 = (-7.70904075)/4 = -1.9272601875\n\n   Hour2 (02:00:00):\n        d0: 18.219999 - 21.5554583333 = -3.3354593333\n        d1: 22.089001 - 24.3928749583 = -2.3038739583\n        d2: 23.988001 - 26.1984167917 = -2.2104157917\n        d3: 25.395000 - 26.0282916667 = -0.6332916667\n        average = (-3.3354593333 -2.3038739583 -2.2104157917 -0.6332916667)/4 = (-8.48304075)/4 = -2.1207601875\n\n   We'll do for all 24 and then compute the forecast.\n\n   However, note: we are to provide 96 points. We can write a program to compute, but we are doing by hand? \n\n   We can do a table for the 24 hours and then repeat the same seasonal factor for each of the next 4 days, but with the daily mean increasing.\n\n   But note: the seasonal factor is the same for the same hour in different days? \n\n   So we compute the seasonal factor for each hour (0-23) once.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n        Day4 (2016-09-11): daily_mean = 28.34975, then for hour0: 28.34975 + F0, hour1: 28.34975 + F1, ... hour23: 28.34975 + F23\n        Day5: 29.87214 + F0, ... \n        Day6: 31.39453 + F0, ...\n        Day7: 32.91692 + F0, ...\n\n   We must generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-11 00:00:00, then hourly until 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll compute the seasonal factors for all 24 hours.\n\n   Let me compute the seasonal factors (F0 to F23) from the data:\n\n        We have the 4 days of data. We'll compute for each hour the average deviation.\n\n        We'll create a list for F[0..23]:\n\n        F[0] = ( (18.009001 - 21.5554583333) + (22.018999 - 24.3928749583) + (24.691999 - 26.1984167917) + (26.239000 -
