        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to predict 96 steps ahead (next 96 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. But for forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the future? The instruction says the data we are to forecast will have missing values? Actually, the instruction says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" This might be referring to the fact that in the future, there could be missing values? But the task is to forecast the next 96 points. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must generate 96 values.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\". So we are to generate 96 values without any missing? But note: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the future data we are to forecast might have missing values? But the instruction also says: \"remember to give me the complete data. You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n Interpretation: We are to forecast 96 values. The future data might have missing values? But we are to provide the complete data. So we must fill in all 96 values. Therefore, we are to generate 96 numbers, and if we are using a method that cannot handle missing values, we must impute them? However, the provided training data does not have missing values. So we can assume that we are to generate 96 numbers without any missing.\n\n But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the future data (the one we are to forecast) might have missing values? But we are to provide the complete data. So we must impute any missing values? However, we are only given the past 96 points and we are to forecast the next 96. We don't have any future missing values to impute because we are generating the future. So we will generate 96 values.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, we can use a time series model. Given the data is hourly and we have 4 days (96 hours) of history, we can try to capture daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a model that handles seasonality.\n\n However, as an AI, we must choose a method that is robust and can be implemented in this context. We can use:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) with seasonality of 24\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality of 24\n   - Or a simple method like using the average of the same hour in the past days? But note: we only have 4 days of data. So we can use the last 4 days to compute the average for each hour? But the data shows variation.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but that would require more data and feature engineering.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n   - We can compute the average of each hour of the day for the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal average.\n\n However, let's look at the data: \n   The data from 2017-06-18 to 2017-06-21 (4 days). We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over these 4 days and then use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the first day and the last day at the same hour:\n\n   Day1 (2017-06-18 00:00:00): 9.98\n   Day2 (2017-06-19 00:00:00): 8.64\n   Day3 (2017-06-20 00:00:00): 9.913\n   Day4 (2017-06-21 00:00:00): 9.042\n\n The average for hour 0: (9.98 + 8.64 + 9.913 + 9.042) / 4 = 9.39375\n\n Similarly, we can do for each hour.\n\n However, this method ignores any trend and recent changes. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and adjust by the average change from the same day of the week? But we don't have day of the week information? And we only have 4 days.\n\n Another idea: use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n But note: the problem says the future data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast. We are not given any missing values in the future? We are to generate 96 values. So we will generate 96 values without missing.\n\n However, the instruction says: \"be aware of that\" meaning we should be cautious? But we are generating the data, so we can generate without missing.\n\n Since we are limited by the data and the requirement for a quick forecast, we will use the average by hour method.\n\n Steps for the method:\n  1. Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for each hour over the 4 days.\n  2. Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n However, we must generate the dates as well.\n\n How to generate the dates?\n   The last date in the given data is 2017-06-21 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-06-22 00:00:00, then 2017-06-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-25 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours).\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Let's extract the hour from the datetime index.\n\n   We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n   Example for hour 0:\n       2017-06-18 00:00:00: 9.98\n       2017-06-19 00:00:00: 8.64\n       2017-06-20 00:00:00: 9.913\n       2017-06-21 00:00:00: 9.042\n       average = (9.98 + 8.64 + 9.913 + 9.042) / 4 = 9.39375\n\n   Similarly, for hour 1:\n       2017-06-18 01:00:00: 10.047\n       2017-06-19 01:00:00: 8.172\n       2017-06-20 01:00:00: 9.645\n       2017-06-21 01:00:00: 9.109\n       average = (10.047 + 8.172 + 9.645 + 9.109) / 4 = 9.24325\n\n   And so on.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, the hour 0 of each day will be 9.39375, hour 1 will be 9.24325, etc.\n\n   But note: we are using the same value for the same hour in each of the next 4 days? That is, the forecast for 2017-06-22 00:00:00, 2017-06-23 00:00:00, 2017-06-24 00:00:00, 2017-06-25 00:00:00 will all be 9.39375? \n\n   This is a naive seasonal average and does not account for any trend or day-to-day variation. However, with only 4 days of data, it is a simple and reasonable baseline.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use the last day (2017-06-21) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences for the same hour? But that might be more complex.\n\n   Given the simplicity and the data, we go with the average by hour.\n\n   However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (less than a week) so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n   Therefore, we will:\n\n      Step 1: Parse the given data and group by hour (0 to 23).\n      Step 2: Compute the mean for each hour.\n      Step 3: Generate the next 96 hours (from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00) and assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   But note: the data has negative values and fluctuations. This method will smooth out the fluctuations.\n\n   However, we are to provide the complete data. We'll generate 96 records.\n\n   Let's code this:\n\n   First, we have the data as a string. We can parse it into a list of tuples (date, HUFL) or we can use pandas in our mind? Since we are writing the answer, we can do it manually.\n\n   But note: the data is 96 points. We can compute the average for each hour by:\n\n        hour0: [index 0, 24, 48, 72] -> 9.98, 8.64, 9.913, 9.042 -> 9.39375\n        hour1: [1, 25, 49, 73] -> 10.047, 8.172, 9.645, 9.109 -> 9.24325\n        ... \n\n   We have 24 hours and 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n   We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n   Then, the forecast for the first day (2017-06-22) will be:\n        hour0: hourly_avg[0]\n        hour1: hourly_avg[1]\n        ...\n        hour23: hourly_avg[23]\n\n   Similarly for the next three days.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        start: 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n        then 2017-06-22 01:00:00, ... until 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n\n   We can use Python to generate the dates, but since we are writing the answer, we will write a loop for 4 days? Actually 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing. So we are providing the complete data.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (9.980 + 8.640 + 9.913 + 9.042) / 4 = (9.98+8.64=18.62; 18.62+9.913=28.533; 28.533+9.042=37.575) -> 37.575/4 = 9.39375\n        hour1: (10.047+8.172+9.645+9.109) = 10.047+8.172=18.219; 18.219+9.645=27.864; 27.864+9.109=36.973 -> 36.973/4 = 9.24325\n        hour2: (9.511+9.042+9.645+9.042) = 9.511+9.042=18.553; 18.553+9.645=28.198; 28.198+9.042=37.24 -> 37.24/4=9.31\n        hour3: (9.511+8.707+9.913+10.248) = 9.511+8.707=18.218; 18.218+9.913=28.131; 28.131+10.248=38.379 -> 38.379/4=9.59475\n        hour4: (9.846+8.640+9.846+8.439) = 9.846+8.640=18.486; 18.486+9.846=28.332; 28.332+8.439=36.771 -> 36.771/4=9.19275\n        hour5: (12.659+9.980+9.779+11.186) = 12.659+9.980=22.639; 22.639+9.779=32.418; 32.418+11.186=43.604 -> 43.604/4=10.901\n        hour6: (10.449+10.382+8.306+9.042) = 10.449+10.382=20.831; 20.831+8.306=29.137; 29.137+9.042=38.179 -> 38.179/4=9.54475\n        hour7: (6.899+9.846+5.894+8.306) = 6.899+9.846=16.745; 16.745+5.894=22.639; 22.639+8.306=30.945 -> 30.945/4=7.73625\n        hour8: (0.000+6.296+1.474+7.770) = 0.000+6.296=6.296; 6.296+1.474=7.77; 7.77+7.770=15.54 -> 15.54/4=3.885\n        hour9: (-8.038+3.014+ -0.268+5.425) = -8.038+3.014=-5.024; -5.024-0.268=-5.292; -5.292+5.425=0.133 -> 0.133/4=0.03325\n        hour10: (-0.268+2.143+0.536+6.564) = -0.268+2.143=1.875; 1.875+0.536=2.411; 2.411+6.564=8.975 -> 8.975/4=2.24375\n        hour11: (-0.737+ -0.335+ -6.765+2.210) = -0.737-0.335=-1.072; -1.072-6.765=-7.837; -7.837+2.210=-5.627 -> -5.627/4=-1.40675\n        hour12: (-9.243+0.670+ -13.262+ -4.890) = -9.243+0.670=-8.573; -8.573-13.262=-21.835; -21.835-4.890=-26.725 -> -26.725/4=-6.68125\n        hour13: (-3.148+ -5.492+ -4.287+ -8.640) = -3.148-5.492=-8.64; -8.64-4.287=-12.927; -12.927-8.640=-21.567 -> -21.567/4=-5.39175\n        hour14: (0.871+2.344+ -10.047+ -9.712) = 0.871+2.344=3.215; 3.215-10.047=-6.832; -6.832-9.712=-16.544 -> -16.544/4=-4.136\n        hour15: (-2.880+6.564+0.536+ -2.210) = -2.880+6.564=3.684; 3.684+0.536=4.22; 4.22-2.210=2.01 -> 2.01/4=0.5025\n        hour16: (0.603+6.162+1.072+0.000) = 0.603+6.162=6.765; 6.765+1.072=7.837; 7.837+0.000=7.837 -> 7.837/4=1.95925\n        hour17: (1.340+8.640+4.220+2.813) = 1.340+8.640=9.98; 9.98+4.220=14.2; 14.2+2.813=17.013 -> 17.013/4=4.25325\n        hour18: (5.626+6.966+5.425+4.622) = 5.626+6.966=12.592; 12.592+5.425=18.017; 18.017+4.622=22.639 -> 22.639/4=5.65975\n        hour19: (6.765+6.966+7.301+6.631) = 6.765+6.966=13.731; 13.731+7.301=21.032; 21.032+6.631=27.663 -> 27.663/4=6.91575\n        hour20: (7.502+7.502+8.172+8.038) = 7.502+7.502=15.004; 15.004+8.172=23.176; 23.176+8.038=31.214 -> 31.214/4=7.8035\n        hour21: (7.100+6.698+8.707+7.636) = 7.100+6.698=13.798; 13.798+8.707=22.505; 22.505+7.636=30.141 -> 30.141/4=7.53525\n        hour22: (6.497+6.497+8.038+6.832) = 6.497+6.497=12.994; 12.994+8.038=21.032; 21.032+6.832=27.864 -> 27.864/4=6.966\n        hour23: (6.698+7.971+7.636+9.645) = 6.698+7.971=14.669; 14.669+7.636=22.305; 22.305+9.645=31.95 -> 31.95/4=7.9875\n\n   Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-06-22\n           00:00:00 -> 9.39375\n           01:00:00 -> 9.24325\n           02:00:00 -> 9.31\n           03:00:00 -> 9.59475\n           04:00:00 -> 9.19275\n           05:00:00 -> 10.901\n           06:00:00 -> 9.54475\n           07:00:00 -> 7.73625\n           08:00:00 -> 3.885\n           09:00:00 -> 0.03325\n           10:00:00 -> 2.24375\n           11:00:00 -> -1.40675\n           12:00:00 -> -6.68125\n           13:00:00 -> -5.39175\n           14:00:00 -> -4.136\n           15:00:00 -> 0.5025\n           16:00:00 -> 1.95925\n           17:00:00 -> 4.25325\n           18:00:00 -> 5.65975\n           19:00:00 -> 6.91575\n           20:00:00 -> 7.8035\n           21:00:00 -> 7.53525\n           22:00:00 -> 6.966\n           23:00:00 -> 7.9875\n\n        Day2: 2017-06-23: same as above for each hour\n        Day3: 2017-06-24: same\n        Day4: 2017-06-25: same\n\n   But note: the problem says the future data might have missing values?

Actually, -4.136 is -4.13600, so we leave as -4.136)\n        However, we computed -16.544/4 = -4.136 -> so it's exactly -4.136? Then we write -4.136.\n\n        But let's check: -16.544/4 = -4.136 -> so it's exact.\n\n        hour15: 0.5025 -> 0.503 (because 0.5025: the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal from 2 to 3)\n        hour16: 1.95925 -> 1.959\n        hour17: 4.25325 -> 4.253\n        hour18: 5.65975 -> 5.660\n        hour19: 6.91575 -> 6.916\n        hour20: 7.8035 -> 7.804 (because 7.8035: 4th decimal is 5, so round up the 3rd decimal from 3 to 4)\n        hour21: 7.53525 -> 7.535\n        hour22: 6.966 -> 6.966\n        hour23: 7.9875 -> 7.988\n\n   Now, we write the 4 days.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-06-22\n        Day2: 2017-06-23\n        Day3: 2017-06-24\n        Day4: 2017-06-25\n\n   And for each day, we output 24 hours.\n\n   Format: \n        YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS   value (with 3 decimal places)\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-06-22 00:00:00   9.394\n        2017-06-22 01:00:00   9.243\n        2017-06-22 02:00:00   9.310\n        2017-06-22 03:00:00   9.595\n        2017-06-22 04:00:00   9.193\n        2017-06-22 05:00:00  10.901\n        2017-06-22 06:00:00   9.545\n        2017-06-22 07:00:00   7.736\n        2017-06-22 08:00:00   3.885\n        2017-06-22 09:00:00   0.033\n        2017-06-22 10:00:00   2.244\n        2017-06-22 11:00:00  -1.407\n        2017-06-22 12:00:00  -6.681\n        2017-06-22 13:00:00  -5.392\n        2017-06-22 14:00:00  -4.136\n        2017-06-22 15:00:00   0.503\n        2017-06-22 16:00:00   1.959\n        2017-06-22 17:00:00   4.253\n        2017-06-22 18:00:00   5.660\n        2017-06-22 19:00:00   6.916\n        2017-06-22 20:00:00   7.804\n        2017-06-22 21:00:00   7.535\n        2017-06-22 22:00:00   6.966\n        2017-06-22 23:00:00   7.988\n\n        Then for 2017-06-23: same values for each hour.\n\n   We'll write the same 24 values for the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing. So we are providing the complete data.\n\n   We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n   We must be cautious: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", meaning the future data we are to forecast might have missing? But we are to provide the complete data. So we are imputing by our forecast? Actually, we are generating the forecast. We are not given the future data with missing values. We are to forecast the next 96 points. So we generate 96 points.\n\n   Therefore, we proceed.\n\n   We'll output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-06-22 00:00:00   9.394\n        2017-06-22 01:00:00   9.243\n        ... (until 2017-06-25 23:00:00)\n        ```\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only given HUFL? And we are forecasting HUFL. So we output only HUFL.\n\n   We are to output two columns: date and HUFL.\n\n   We do as above.\n\n   Let's code the entire 96 lines? We can write a list of the 24 rounded averages and then repeat them 4 days.\n\n   We'll write the answer accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we write all 96.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hourly_avg_rounded = [\n            9.394, 9.243, 9.310, 9.595, 9.193, 10.901, 9.545, 7.736, \n            3.885, 0.033, 2.244, -1.407, -6.681, -5.392, -4.136, 0.503, \n            1.959, 4.253, 5.660, 6.916, 7.804, 7.535, 6.966, 7.988\n        ]\n\n        Then for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            day = 22 + day_offset\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-06-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = hourly_avg_rounded[hour]\n                # but note: day 22,23,24,25? But June has 30 days, so 22,23,24,25 are valid.\n\n        However, we must format the day as two digits: 22, 23, 24, 25.\n\n        But note: 2017-06-22, 2017-06-23, 2017-06-24, 2017-06-25.\n\n   We'll generate the dates correctly.\n\n   We write:\n\n        for day in [22,23,24,25]:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                print(f\"2017-06-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00   {hourly_avg_rounded[hour]:.3f}\")\n\n   But note: the value for each hour is the same for each day? Yes, because we are using the same average.\n\n   However, we computed the average over the 4 days and then we are using that average for the next 4 days? That is consistent.\n\n   We output the data.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output 96 lines.\n\n   We write the answer accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data is sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes. But the given data is hourly. So we are hourly.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and we are to forecast the next 96. We have done.\n\n   We output the answer in the required format.\n\n   Let's write the first 5 and last 5 of the 96 lines to check:\n\n        First 5:\n            2017-06-22 00:00:00   9.394\n            2017-06-22 01:00:00   9.243\n            2017-06-22 02:00:00   9.310\n            2017-06-22 03:00:00   9.595\n            2017-06-22 04:00:00   9.193\n\n        Last 5:\n            2017-06-25 19:00:00   6.916\n            2017-06-25 20:00:00   7.804\n            2017-06-25 21:00:00   7.535\n            2017-06-25 22:00:00   6.966\n            2017-06-25 23:00:00   7.988\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   We write the entire 96 lines in the answer block.\n\n   Note: The problem says \"Please obey the format strictly.\" and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-06-22 00:00:00   9.394\n        ...
