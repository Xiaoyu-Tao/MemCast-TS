        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious in our method to handle potential missingness in the future? \n    But the instruction says: \"be aware of that\" meaning the provided data might have missing values? However, the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n\n 3. We are to choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data is relatively short (only 96 points) and we don't have external regressors, \n    we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend. The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours) and also a pattern? \n\n 4. We can use models like:\n    - SARIMA: which can handle seasonality. We have hourly data and daily seasonality (period=24).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n    - Given the small data size, we might also consider using a simple method if the data is very noisy.\n\n 5. However, note that we are only given 4 days of data. This is very limited. We must be cautious.\n\n 6. Let's analyze the data pattern:\n    - Looking at the data, we see that each day the HUFL starts at a certain level (around 9-10) at midnight, then decreases to a low during the day (around 5-7) and then increases again in the evening and night.\n    - There is a daily pattern: \n        Day 1 (Nov 6): starts at 9.913, then goes down to around 5-6 in the afternoon, then up to 9.779 at 23:00.\n        Day 2 (Nov 7): starts at 14.267, then down to 4.354 at 21:00, then up to 9.511 at 23:00.\n        Day 3 (Nov 8): starts at 10.65, then down to 5.559 at 22:00, then up to 7.904 at 23:00.\n        Day 4 (Nov 9): starts at 10.985, then down to 7.569 at 21:00, then up to 10.784 at 23:00.\n\n    - The pattern is not exactly the same every day, but there is a clear daily cycle.\n\n 7. Given the small data size, we can use a simple seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component along with a trend? \n    But note: we have 4 days, so we can compute the average daily pattern? However, the level of the pattern changes.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n    - Since the data has daily seasonality, we can use the last day (Nov 9) as the pattern for the next day? But that might not capture the trend.\n\n 9. We can try to use a model that uses multiple seasonal patterns? But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we can use a seasonal naive method: \n     - Forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day? But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n        However, 4 days is very short and there might be a trend.\n\n 11. Another idea: use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality. But with 4 days, the seasonality period is 24, and we have 96 points, which is exactly 4*24. \n      This is the minimum to fit a seasonal model. We can try to fit an ETS model with additive seasonality and trend? \n\n 12. However, note that the data does not show a clear overall trend. The first two days have higher values at the start (midnight) than the last two? \n      Day1: 9.913, Day2: 14.267, Day3: 10.65, Day4: 10.985 -> no clear trend.\n\n 13. We can also consider using a moving average method? \n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can do:\n\n      Option 1: Use the same pattern as the last day (Nov 9) for the next day? But that would be too naive and ignore the variation.\n\n      Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. \n\n      However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have a week of data.\n\n 15. Considering the above, we can use a simple average of the same hour for the next 4 days? But then we are repeating the same pattern for the next 4 days? \n      That would be acceptable? But the problem is that the next 4 days might be similar to the past 4 days? \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality and a possible trend. We can try to fit a linear trend for each hour? But with only 4 points per hour, it's not enough.\n\n 17. Given the time and simplicity, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? \n\n      For example, for 00:00:00, we have 4 values: \n          2016-11-06 00:00:00: 9.913\n          2016-11-07 00:00:00: 14.267\n          2016-11-08 00:00:00: 10.650\n          2016-11-09 00:00:00: 10.985\n\n      The average = (9.913+14.267+10.650+10.985)/4 = 11.45375\n\n      Then for the next 4 days at 00:00:00, we would use 11.45375? \n\n      But that would make the same value for every day at 00:00? \n\n      Actually, we are forecasting 4 days, so we would have 4 values for 00:00:00? But we are forecasting 96 hours, so we have 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n      We can create a daily pattern by taking the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n      Steps:\n        - Group by hour of the day (00,01,...,23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n        - Then for the next 4 days, we use the same mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n      This method is called the \"seasonal naive\" with average.\n\n 18. However, note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. \n\n 19. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (9.913 + 14.267 + 10.650 + 10.985) / 4 = 11.45375\n        hour1: (7.770 + 14.133 + 7.167 + 8.172) / 4 = 9.3105\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. Then for the next 4 days (from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00), we assign:\n        Nov 10 00:00:00 -> 11.45375\n        Nov 10 01:00:00 -> 9.3105\n        ... \n        Nov 10 23:00:00 -> (average of the 23:00 of the 4 days)\n        Then Nov 11 00:00:00 -> 11.45375\n        and so on.\n\n 21. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 22. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? In the provided data, we don't have missing values. \n      However, in the future forecast, we are not given any missing values? We are to generate the next 96 points without gaps.\n\n 23. We must output the complete 96 points.\n\n 24. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n 25. We have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days: Nov 6,7,8,9.\n\n 26. We'll create a list of 24 values (for each hour) by averaging the 4 days.\n\n 27. Then we repeat this list 4 times (for the next 4 days: Nov 10,11,12,13).\n\n 28. The dates for the next 96 hours:\n        Start: 2016-11-10 00:00:00\n        Then: 2016-11-10 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-13 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL'\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: (9.913 + 14.267 + 10.650 + 10.985) / 4 = 11.45375\n        hour1: (7.770 + 14.133 + 7.167 + 8.172) / 4 = (7.770+14.133=21.903; 7.167+8.172=15.339; 21.903+15.339=37.242; 37.242/4=9.3105)\n        hour2: (8.774 + 11.320 + 8.172 + 6.698) / 4 = (8.774+11.320=20.094; 8.172+6.698=14.87; 20.094+14.87=34.964; 34.964/4=8.741)\n        hour3: (8.774 + 13.463 + 10.047 + 7.234) / 4 = (8.774+13.463=22.237; 10.047+7.234=17.281; 22.237+17.281=39.518; 39.518/4=9.8795)\n        hour4: (9.243 + 13.999 + 9.444 + 7.904) / 4 = (9.243+13.999=23.242; 9.444+7.904=17.348; 23.242+17.348=40.59; 40.59/4=10.1475)\n        hour5: (8.439 + 12.994 + 8.038 + 8.372) / 4 = (8.439+12.994=21.433; 8.038+8.372=16.41; 21.433+16.41=37.843; 37.843/4=9.46075)\n        hour6: (9.645 + 13.798 + 10.918 + 9.176) / 4 = (9.645+13.798=23.443; 10.918+9.176=20.094; 23.443+20.094=43.537; 43.537/4=10.88425)\n        hour7: (10.918 + 15.673 + 10.918 + 9.243) / 4 = (10.918+15.673=26.591; 10.918+9.243=20.161; 26.591+20.161=46.752; 46.752/4=11.688)\n        hour8: (8.172 + 12.592 + 10.047 + 5.559) / 4 = (8.172+12.592=20.764; 10.047+5.559=15.606; 20.764+15.606=36.37; 36.37/4=9.0925)\n        hour9: (6.497 + 7.770 + 7.435 + 6.966) / 4 = (6.497+7.770=14.267; 7.435+6.966=14.401; 14.267+14.401=28.668; 28.668/4=7.167)\n        hour10: (7.234 + 7.569 + 8.908 + 6.028) / 4 = (7.234+7.569=14.803; 8.908+6.028=14.936; 14.803+14.936=29.739; 29.739/4=7.43475)\n        hour11: (7.234 + 8.172 + 8.908 + 6.765) / 4 = (7.234+8.172=15.406; 8.908+6.765=15.673; 15.406+15.673=31.079; 31.079/4=7.76975)\n        hour12: (5.492 + 6.229 + 6.095 + 4.957) / 4 = (5.492+6.229=11.721; 6.095+4.957=11.052; 11.721+11.052=22.773; 22.773/4=5.69325)\n        hour13: (5.090 + 5.760 + 6.095 + 7.167) / 4 = (5.090+5.760=10.85; 6.095+7.167=13.262; 10.85+13.262=24.112; 24.112/4=6.028)\n        hour14: (5.894 + 6.497 + 7.167 + 7.770) / 4 = (5.894+6.497=12.391; 7.167+7.770=14.937; 12.391+14.937=27.328; 27.328/4=6.832)\n        hour15: (5.693 + 6.698 + 7.100 + 7.033) / 4 = (5.693+6.698=12.391; 7.100+7.033=14.133; 12.391+14.133=26.524; 26.524/4=6.631)\n        hour16: (5.492 + 6.564 + 6.966 + 8.105) / 4 = (5.492+6.564=12.056; 6.966+8.105=15.071; 12.056+15.071=27.127; 27.127/4=6.78175)\n        hour17: (6.899 + 8.105 + 8.372 + 9.779) / 4 = (6.899+8.105=15.004; 8.372+9.779=18.151; 15.004+18.151=33.155; 33.155/4=8.28875)\n        hour18: (7.167 + 6.765 + 7.904 + 8.306) / 4 = (7.167+6.765=13.932; 7.904+8.306=16.21; 13.932+16.21=30.142; 30.142/4=7.5355)\n        hour19: (6.765 + 6.095 + 7.234 + 7.837) / 4 = (6.765+6.095=12.86; 7.234+7.837=15.071; 12.86+15.071=27.931; 27.931/4=6.98275)\n        hour20: (5.760 + 5.358 + 6.296 + 7.234) / 4 = (5.760+5.358=11.118; 6.296+7.234=13.53; 11.118+13.53=24.648; 24.648/4=6.162)\n        hour21: (6.430 + 4.354 + 5.626 + 7.569) / 4 = (6.430+4.354=10.784; 5.626+7.569=13.195; 10.784+13.195=23.979; 23.979/4=5.99475)\n        hour22: (9.377 + 6.765 + 5.559 + 11.052) / 4 = (9.377+6.765=16.142; 5.559+11.052=16.611; 16.142+16.611=32.753; 32.753/4=8.18825)\n        hour23: (9.779 + 9.511 + 7.904 + 10.784) / 4 = (9.779+9.511=19.29; 7.904+10.784=18.688; 19.29+18.688=37.978; 37.978/4=9.4945)\n\n 31. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-10 \n           00:00:00 -> 11.45375\n           01:00:00 -> 9.3105\n           02:00:00 -> 8.741\n           03:00:00 -> 9.8795\n           04:00:00 -> 10.1475\n           05:00:00 -> 9.46075\n           06:00:00 -> 10.88425\n           07:00:00 -> 11.688\n           08:00:00 -> 9.0925\n           09:00:00 -> 7.167\n           10:00:00 -> 7.43475\n           11:00:00 -> 7.76975\n           12:00:00 -> 5.69325\n           13:00:00 -> 6.028\n           14:00:00 -> 6.832\n           15:00:00 -> 6.631\n           16:00:00 -> 6.78175\n           17:00:00 -> 8.28875\n           18:00:00 -> 7.5355\n           19:00:00 -> 6.98275\n           20:00:00 -> 6.162\n           21:00:00 -> 5.99475\n           22:00:00 -> 8.18825\n           23:00:00 -> 9.4945\n\n        Day 2: 2016-11-11: same 24 values as above )\n        Day 3: 2016-11-12: same\n        Day 4: 2016-11-13: same\n\n 32. We must output the data with the exact date format and the HUFL value rounded to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n 33. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. Let's write the data:\n\n        Start date: 2016-11-10 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-11-13 23:00:00.\n\n 35. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2016, 11, 10, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [start + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 36. And the HUFL values: we have a list of 24 values (the averages) and we repeat it 4 times.\n\n 37. But note: the averages we computed are for hours 0 to 23. We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of 24 numbers (rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n 38. Then the HUFL for the next 96 hours is: \n        [hourly_avg[0], hourly_avg[1], ... , hourly_avg[23], \n         hourly_avg[0], hourly_avg[1], ... , hourly_avg[23],\n         ... 4 times]\n\n 39. We'll compute the hourly_avg list with the values we calculated above and round to 3 decimals.\n\n 40. Let's recompute and round:\n\n        hour0: 11.45375 -> 11.454\n        hour1: 9.3105 -> 9.311\n        hour2: 8.741 -> 8.741\n        hour3: 9.8795 -> 9.880\n        hour4: 10.1475 -> 10.148\n        hour5: 9.46075 -> 9.461\n        hour6: 10.88425 -> 10.884\n        hour7: 11.688 -> 11.688\n        hour8: 9.0925 -> 9.093\n        hour9: 7.167 -> 7.167   (exactly 7.167, so 7.167)\n        hour10: 7.43475 -> 7.435\n        hour11: 7.76975 -> 7.770\n        hour12: 5.69325 -> 5.693\n        hour13: 6.028 -> 6.028\n        hour14: 6.832 -> 6.832\n        hour15: 6.631 -> 6.631\n        hour16: 6.78175 -> 6.782\n        hour17: 8.28875 -> 8.289\n        hour18: 7.5355 -> 7.536\n        hour19: 6.98275 -> 6.983\n        hour20: 6.162 -> 6.162\n        hour21: 5.99475 -> 5.995\n        hour22: 8.18825 -> 8.188\n        hour23: 9.4945 -> 9.495\n\n 41. Now, note: the input data had 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 42. We'll create the list:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            11.454, 9.311, 8.741, 9.880, 10.148, 9.461, 10.884, 11.688, \n            9.093, 7.167, 7.435, 7.770, 5.693, 6.028, 6.832, 6.631, \n            6.782, 8.289, 7.536, 6.983, 6.162, 5.995, 8.188, 9.495\n        ]\n\n 43. Then the HUFL for the next 96 hours is: \n        [11.454, 9.311, 8.741, ... (repeat 4 times) ]\n\n 44. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-10 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-11-13 23:00:00\n\n 45. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-10 00:00:00  11.454\n2016-11-10 01:00:00   9.311\n... \n2016-11-13 23:00:00   9.495\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 46. We must not omit any content.\n\n 47. Let's write the code to generate the dates and the values.\n\n 48. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing values.\n\n 49. We are done.\n\n But note: This is a very simple method. In practice, with more data we would use a more sophisticated model. But given the data size, this is acceptable.\n\n Let's output the data.\n",
