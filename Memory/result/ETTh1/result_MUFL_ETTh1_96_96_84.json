        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-06-02 00:00:00 to 2017-06-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data shows a clear daily seasonality (with peaks and troughs at similar times each day).\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since the data has seasonality and we are to forecast multiple steps ahead, we can use a seasonal time series model.\n However, note that the data might have missing values? The given data does not show missing values in the provided snippet, but the problem states to be aware of missing values.\n\n But in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values? Let me check: \n   The data starts at 2017-06-02 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-06-05 23:00:00, and there are 96 entries (24*4=96). So no missing in the given.\n\n However, for forecasting, we must handle the possibility of missing values in the future? But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided data might have missing values? \n But in the given data, we don't see any. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n But note: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then the data. So we have 96 points without missing.\n\n However, the forecasting for the next 96 must be provided without missing? So we will generate 96 points.\n\n How to forecast?\n  We can use a model that handles seasonality. Since we are in an expert setting and without specific software, we can use a simple but effective method: \n  - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But we need to extrapolate 96 points.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a seasonal naive method? But that would just repeat the last season. However, the data might have a trend? \n\n  Let's observe the data: \n    The values in the same hour of the day are similar but not exactly the same. There is a pattern that repeats every 24 hours.\n\n  We can use an average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n  But note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more robust method.\n\n  However, without the ability to run complex models (like ARIMA or Prophet) in this environment, we have to use a simple method.\n\n  Proposed method:\n    We will use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    For example:\n      The forecast for 2017-06-06 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2017-06-05) at hour 00:00:00 will be the average of the 00:00:00 values from 2017-06-02, 2017-06-03, 2017-06-04, 2017-06-05.\n\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n  Why this method?\n    - It captures the daily seasonality.\n    - It is simple and robust to some level of noise.\n\n  But note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the provided 4 days, the values at the same hour are:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-06-02): 6.361\n    Day 2 (2017-06-03): 7.071\n    Day 3 (2017-06-04): 6.254\n    Day 4 (2017-06-05): 7.782\n\n  For 00:00:00. There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend. So averaging is acceptable.\n\n  Steps for the forecast:\n    Let the historical data be in a matrix of 4 days (rows) and 24 hours (columns). We compute the average for each hour.\n\n    However, note: the data starts at 00:00:00 and ends at 23:00:00 each day. We have 24 hours per day.\n\n    We have 4 days: \n        Day0: 2017-06-02 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day1: 2017-06-03 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day2: 2017-06-04 (index 48 to 71)\n        Day3: 2017-06-05 (index 72 to 95)\n\n    For hour h (0<=h<=23), the historical values are:\n        h0: data[h]   -> 2017-06-02 at h:00:00\n        h1: data[24]  -> 2017-06-03 at h:00:00\n        h2: data[48]  -> 2017-06-04 at h:00:00\n        h3: data[72]  -> 2017-06-05 at h:00:00\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-06-06 to 2017-06-09) at hour h will be the average of [h0, h1, h2, h3] for the same hour h.\n\n    Therefore, the entire forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the same 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times? \n    But wait: we are using the same hour from the 4 days to compute the average for that hour, and then we use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Actually, we are going to repeat the same 24-hour pattern (the average pattern) for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note: the problem says \"forecast the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 hours. So we will have 4 days, each day having 24 hours.\n\n    So we compute a vector `avg_hourly` of length 24, where:\n        avg_hourly[0] = (value at 00:00:00 of day0 + day1 + day2 + day3) / 4\n        avg_hourly[1] = (value at 01:00:00 of day0 + day1 + day2 + day3) / 4\n        ... and so on.\n\n    Then the forecast for:\n        2017-06-06 00:00:00 -> avg_hourly[0]\n        2017-06-06 01:00:00 -> avg_hourly[1]\n        ...\n        2017-06-06 23:00:00 -> avg_hourly[23]\n        2017-06-07 00:00:00 -> avg_hourly[0]\n        ... and so on until 2017-06-09 23:00:00 -> avg_hourly[23]\n\n  But note: the last day in the history is 2017-06-05. The next day is 2017-06-06, then 2017-06-07, 2017-06-08, 2017-06-09.\n\n  We have to generate 96 points.\n\n  Let's compute the averages:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day0: 6.361\n        Day1: 7.071\n        Day2: 6.254\n        Day3: 7.782\n        Average = (6.361 + 7.071 + 6.254 + 7.782) / 4 = 27.468 / 4 = 6.867\n\n    Example for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Day0: 6.219\n        Day1: 6.823\n        Day2: 4.726   # Note: the second hour of 2017-06-04 is at index 49? Actually, let me check:\n\n        The data for 2017-06-04 01:00:00 is the 25th row? Actually, the first 24 are 2017-06-02, then next 24 are 2017-06-03, then 2017-06-04 starts at index 48? \n        So:\n          index0: 2017-06-02 00:00:00 -> hour0\n          index1: 2017-06-02 01:00:00 -> hour1\n          ...\n          index24: 2017-06-03 00:00:00 -> hour0 of next day\n          index25: 2017-06-03 01:00:00 -> hour1 of next day\n\n        So for hour1 (01:00:00) we have:\n          Day0: index1 -> 6.219\n          Day1: index25 -> 6.823\n          Day2: index49 -> 4.726   (because 2017-06-04 01:00:00 is the 49th row? Actually, 48 is 00:00, 49 is 01:00)\n          Day3: index73 -> 7.427   (2017-06-05 01:00:00 is at index 73: because 72 is 00:00, 73 is 01:00)\n\n        Average = (6.219 + 6.823 + 4.726 + 7.427) / 4 = 25.195 / 4 = 6.29875\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n  However, note: the data for 2017-06-04 01:00:00 is given as 4.726? Yes, in the provided data.\n\n  But wait: the data for 2017-06-04 00:00:00 is 6.254, then 01:00:00 is 4.726? That's correct.\n\n  We'll compute the average for each hour and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not missing in the history, but what if in the future we are to forecast and we are forced to provide 96 points? \n  We are generating 96 points without missing.\n\n  Let's code the computation:\n\n    We'll extract the 4 days and reshape into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n    Then compute the mean for each column (each hour).\n\n    Then the forecast is the 24 means repeated 4 times (to make 96 points).\n\n  However, is this the best? \n    It is simple and captures the daily pattern. But it ignores any trend and any other patterns. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a weekly pattern or a trend.\n\n  Alternatively, we could use the last day (2017-06-05) as the forecast? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast of period 24. \n  But the problem says we are an expert, so we use the average to smooth out noise.\n\n  We choose the average method.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Let data = the 96 points.\n\n    Reshape: \n        day0 = data[0:24]\n        day1 = data[24:48]\n        day2 = data[48:72]\n        day3 = data[72:96]\n\n    Then for each hour h in 0..23:\n        avg[h] = (day0[h] + day1[h] + day2[h] + day3[h]) / 4.0\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days is:\n        day4: [avg[0], avg[1], ..., avg[23]]\n        day5: [avg[0], avg[1], ..., avg[23]]\n        day6: [avg[0], avg[1], ..., avg[23]]\n        day7: [avg[0], avg[1], ..., avg[23]]\n\n  The dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-06 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-06-05 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-06-06 01:00:00, ... until 2017-06-09 23:00:00.\n\n  We generate 96 timestamps.\n\n  Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2017-06-06 00:00:00, [value]\n        2017-06-06 01:00:00, [value]\n        ...\n        2017-06-09 23:00:00, [value]\n        </answer>\n\n  We must provide the complete data.\n\n  Let's compute the averages:\n\n    We'll do it step by step for each hour.\n\n    We have the data in a list? We can write a small program in our mind.\n\n    But note: the data is provided above. We can extract the values.\n\n    We'll create a list of the MUFL values in order.\n\n    Given:\n\n        data = [\n            6.361000, 6.219000, 6.503000, 4.762000, 4.762000, 5.899000, 4.691000, 4.548000, -0.391000, -4.371000, -7.143000, -8.280000, -11.016000, -11.371000, -8.813000, -6.467000, -1.990000, 2.239000, 3.020000, 4.655000, 5.543000, 5.188000, 7.995000, 5.970000,   #

The input had 3 decimal places, but the average might have more. We'll output with 6 decimal places as in the example.\n\n    But the example input had 3 decimal places? Actually, the example input had 3 decimal places but we see 6.361000 -> so 3 decimal places but stored with 6? \n    We'll output with 6 decimal places to match.\n\n    Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places? But the problem says \"complete data\", and the input had 6.361000 (6 digits after decimal? actually 3 digits and then 3 zeros). \n    But the numbers we computed are not integers. We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n    We can format each number to have 6 decimal places.\n\n    Let's write the forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2017-06-06\n            hour0: 6.867000\n            hour1: 6.298750\n            hour2: 5.356750\n            hour3: 5.987750\n            hour4: 5.596500\n            hour5: 5.818750\n            hour6: 6.130000\n            hour7: 4.690250\n            hour8: 1.075000\n            hour9: -3.713500\n            hour10: -4.033500\n            hour11: -8.013500\n            hour12: -9.745500\n            hour13: -7.879750\n            hour14: -6.654000\n            hour15: -4.228500\n            hour16: -0.888250\n            hour17: 3.562250\n            hour18: 3.278000\n            hour19: 4.193250\n            hour20: 4.637250\n            hour21: 4.308500\n            hour22: 5.143500\n            hour23: 4.983750\n\n        Then repeat the same for the next three days.\n\n    We'll generate the dates:\n\n        base_date = 2017-06-06 00:00:00\n        Then add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n    We can use:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta  -> but we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n        We know:\n            Day0: 2017-06-06\n            Day1: 2017-06-07\n            Day2: 2017-06-08\n            Day3: 2017-06-09\n\n        For each day in [6,7,8,9] of June 2017, and for each hour in 0..23.\n\n    We write:\n\n        for day in range(6,10):   # 6,7,8,9\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = f\"2017-06-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                # for the first day (6) we use the hour index 0..23 -> the same as our avg_hourly list\n                value = avg_hourly[hour]\n\n    But note: the day 6 is the 6th, then 7,8,9.\n\n    However, the 9th is the last.\n\n    We have 4 days: 6,7,8,9 -> 4*24=96.\n\n    We output the value with 6 decimal places: format: \"{:.6f}\".format(value)\n\n    But note: negative numbers? The formatting will work.\n\n    Let's do it.\n\n    We must be cautious: the average for hour12 was -9.7455 -> we output -9.745500\n\n    We'll write the data in the example format: two columns: date and MUFL.\n\n    The example had:\n\n        2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\n\n    So we output: \"2017-06-06 00:00:00,6.867000\" -> but the example had a space? Actually, the example had:\n\n        \"2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\"\n\n    It used multiple spaces? We can use a comma? The problem says \"complete data\" and the format in the example was:\n\n        date       MUFL\n\n    But in the answer, we are to put in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        ... \n        </answer>\n\n    We'll output: \"2017-06-06 00:00:00,6.867000\" with a comma? Or with spaces? \n\n    The example input had:\n\n        \"2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\"\n\n    It had multiple spaces. But the problem does not specify the exact output format. However, the example input had a tab or multiple spaces.\n\n    We'll use a comma to separate as in the typical CSV. But the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and the example input was given with spaces.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the same alignment? But the problem does not require alignment.\n\n    Since the problem says \"the complete data\", we'll output the date and the value separated by a comma? Or by spaces? \n\n    The example input had:\n\n        \"2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\"\n\n    So it had a space between the time and the value? Actually, the time is \"00:00:00\" and then there are multiple spaces? \n\n    We can use: \n\n        \"2017-06-06 00:00:00   {value:.6f}\"\n\n    with the same number of spaces? The example had 3 spaces? Actually, the example had:\n\n        \"2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\"\n\n    It had two spaces? Or one tab? We see in the example: \n\n        \"2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\" -> there are two spaces? \n\n    We'll use two spaces.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"obey the format strictly\" and the example output in the problem statement was:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n    So we are to write the data in a code block? And the data should be in the same format as the input? \n\n    The input had:\n\n        date       MUFL\n        2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\n\n    So we output:\n\n        date       MUFL\n        2017-06-06 00:00:00   6.867000\n        ...\n\n    But the problem says \"complete data\", meaning we output the header? The example input had a header.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then the data without header? Actually, the example input had:\n\n               date       MUFL\n        2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\n\n    But in the text, it was printed with the header. But the problem says \"I will now give you data\", and then the data including the header? \n\n    But in the problem statement, the data was given with the header. However, the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, so we don't need the header? \n\n    The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n    And the example input had the header? But we are to output only the forecast? \n\n    We'll output without the header? \n\n    But the problem says \"complete data\", meaning the data points? \n\n    We'll output 96 lines, each line: \n\n        \"2017-06-06 00:00:00   {value:.6f}\"\n\n    with two spaces? \n\n    Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\"\n\n    and the value had 6 decimal places? Actually, 3 decimal places and then 3 zeros? \n\n    We'll output 6 decimal places.\n\n    We'll generate:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            value = avg_hourly[i % 24]\n\n    How to compute the dates:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0)\n\n        Then add i hours.\n\n    We can write:\n\n        base_date = \"2017-06-06\"\n        Then for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = (datetime(2017,6,6) + timedelta(days=day_offset, hours=hour)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n    But we are writing manually? We can do:\n\n        Day 6: \n            \"2017-06-06 00:00:00\"\n            \"2017-06-06 01:00:00\"\n            ... \n        Day 7:\n            \"2017-06-07 00:00:00\"\n            ...\n\n    We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n    We have the 24 values for the average pattern = [ ... ]\n\n    Then:\n\n        for day in [6,7,8,9]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                # format the hour as two digits\n                hour_str = f\"{hour:02d}\"\n                date_str = f\"2017-06-{day:02d} {hour_str}:00:00\"\n                value = pattern[hour]\n                # format value to 6 decimal places: \n                value_str = f\"{value:.6f}\"\n\n    But note: the day 6,7,8,9: \n        day6: 2017-06-06\n        day7: 2017-06-07\n        day8: 2017-06-08\n        day9: 2017-06-09\n\n    We output: date_str + \"   \" + value_str\n\n    But the example input had two spaces? Actually, the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-06-02 00:00:00   6.361000\"\n\n    It had two spaces? Or one tab? In the text, it's hard to tell. We'll use two spaces.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem does not specify.\n\n    We'll use two spaces.\n\n    Let's write the answer.\n\n    We have the pattern list:\n\n        pattern = [\n            6.867, 6.29875, 5.35675, 5.98775, 5.5965, 5.81875, 6.13, 4.69025, \n            1.075, -3.7135, -4.0335, -8.0135, -9.7455, -7.87975, -6.654, -4.2285, \n            -0.88825, 3.56225, 3.278, 4.19325, 4.63725, 4.3085, 5.1435, 4.98375\n        ]\n\n    We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-06-06 00:00:00  6.867000\n        2017-06-06 01:00:00  6.298750\n        2017-06-06 02:00:00  5.356750\n        2017-06-06 03:00:00  5.987750\n        2017-06-06 04:00:00  5.596500\n        2017-06-06 05:00:00  5.818750\n        2017-06-06 06:00:00  6.130000\n        2017-06-06 07:00:00  4.690250\n        2017-06-06 08:00:00  1.075000\n        2017-06-06 09:00:00  -3.713500\n        2017-06-06 10:00:00  -4.033500\n        2017-06-06 11:00:00  -8.013500\n        2017-06-06 12:00:00  -9.745500\n        2017-06-06 13:00:00  -7.879750\n        2017-06-06 14:00:00  -6.654000\n        2017-06-06 15:00:00  -4.228500\n        2017-06-06 16:00:00  -0.888250\n        2017-06-06 17:00:00  3.562250\n        2017-06-06 18:00:00  3.278000\n        2017-06-06 19:00:00  4.193250\n        2017-06-06 20:00:00  4.637250\n        2017-06-06 21:00:00  4.308500\n        2017-06-06 22:00:00  5.143500\n        2017-06-06 23:00:00  4.983750\n        ... and the same for the next 3 days.\n\n    We have to write 4 days.\n\n    We'll do the same pattern for 2017-06-07, 2017-06-08, 2017-06-09.\n\n    We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n    Note: the problem says \"mustn't omit any content\", so we must not skip any.\n\n    We'll write the answer accordingly.\n\n    But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
