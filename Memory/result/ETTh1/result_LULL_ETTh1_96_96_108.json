        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can observe that the load is lower during the night and higher during the day.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead (4 days of hourly data).\n 3. Since the data is univariate (only LULL) and we have a clear seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. However, note that the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a seasonal autoregressive model or a simple seasonal naive approach. However, given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n   - Using the last available day (2017-09-09) as a template and adjust with a trend if any? But the data does not show a strong trend over the 4 days, but rather daily seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour to form a typical day and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided data, we don't have any. So we can use the given data to compute the typical daily pattern.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (over the 4 days) and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n   - Group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean.\n\n But note: the data starts at 2017-09-06 (which is a Wednesday) and ends at 2017-09-09 (Saturday). The next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n However, we don't have information about weekly seasonality because we only have 4 days. So we will use the same pattern for each day.\n\n How to compute:\n   - We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n   - We can group by the hour of the day (ignoring the day) and compute the mean.\n\n Example:\n   Hour 00:00: average of [0.883 (2017-09-06), 0.822 (2017-09-07), 0.761 (2017-09-08), 0.944 (2017-09-09)] = (0.883+0.822+0.761+0.944)/4 = 3.41/4 = 0.8525\n\n We'll do this for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided data there are none. So we can compute the mean for each hour.\n\n However, the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the same pattern (the average for each hour) repeated 4 times.\n\n But wait: the data shows some variation from day to day. However, without more data, we cannot capture weekly patterns. So this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a time series model like SARIMA. But with only 4 days, it might be overkill and we don't have enough data to fit a model with multiple seasonal parameters.\n\n Considering the above, we choose the average method.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Extract the hour from the datetime index.\n  2. Group by hour and compute the mean.\n  3. Repeat the resulting 24-hour pattern 4 times to get 96 points.\n\n However, note: the last day in the data is 2017-09-09 (Saturday). The next 4 days are:\n     2017-09-10 (Sunday)\n     2017-09-11 (Monday)\n     2017-09-12 (Tuesday)\n     2017-09-13 (Wednesday)\n\n But we don't have data for Sunday, Monday, etc. to adjust for weekly patterns. So we use the same pattern for all days.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 00: (0.883 + 0.822 + 0.761 + 0.944) / 4 = 0.8525\n Hour 01: (0.822 + 0.701 + 0.731 + 0.761) / 4 = 0.75375\n Hour 02: (0.944 + 0.822 + 0.701 + 0.670) / 4 = 0.78425\n Hour 03: (0.883 + 0.792 + 0.761 + 0.731) / 4 = 0.79175\n Hour 04: (0.761 + 0.761 + 0.822 + 0.761) / 4 = 0.77625\n Hour 05: (0.975 + 0.883 + 0.975 + 0.914) / 4 = 0.93675\n Hour 06: (1.157 + 0.853 + 0.883 + 0.914) / 4 = 0.95175\n Hour 07: (1.371 + 1.005 + 1.005 + 1.097) / 4 = 1.1195\n Hour 08: (1.401 + 1.157 + 1.127 + 1.340) / 4 = 1.25625\n Hour 09: (1.340 + 0.975 + 1.157 + 1.157) / 4 = 1.15725\n Hour 10: (1.401 + 0.883 + 1.157 + 1.218) / 4 = 1.16475\n Hour 11: (1.492 + 0.853 + 0.944 + 1.097) / 4 = 1.0965\n Hour 12: (1.127 + 0.944 + 0.944 + 1.340) / 4 = 1.08875\n Hour 13: (0.975 + 0.853 + 0.731 + 1.127) / 4 = 0.9215\n Hour 14: (1.066 + 0.944 + 1.036 + 1.097) / 4 = 1.03575\n Hour 15: (1.036 + 0.944 + 1.218 + 0.944) / 4 = 1.0355\n Hour 16: (1.066 + 1.188 + 1.157 + 1.066) / 4 = 1.11925\n Hour 17: (0.944 + 0.853 + 1.036 + 0.853) / 4 = 0.9215\n Hour 18: (0.853 + 0.975 + 1.127 + 0.853) / 4 = 0.952\n Hour 19: (0.822 + 0.975 + 0.975 + 0.761) / 4 = 0.88325\n Hour 20: (0.853 + 1.005 + 1.371 + 1.097) / 4 = 1.0815\n Hour 21: (0.761 + 0.975 + 1.036 + 1.005) / 4 = 0.94425\n Hour 22: (0.761 + 0.914 + 1.310 + 0.914) / 4 = 0.97475\n Hour 23: (0.731 + 0.975 + 0.883 + 0.944) / 4 = 0.88325\n\n Now, we create the next 96 hours by repeating this pattern 4 times.\n\n The next 96 hours start at 2017-09-10 00:00:00 and end at 2017-09-13 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n However, note: the data we have is in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. We'll generate the next 96 hours by incrementing the last date.\n\n The last date in the given data is 2017-09-09 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-09-10 00:00:00.\n\n We'll create:\n\n  2017-09-10 00:00:00: 0.8525\n  2017-09-10 01:00:00: 0.75375\n  ... and so on for 24 hours of 2017-09-10.\n\n Then 2017-09-11: same pattern, then 2017-09-12, then 2017-09-13.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the history, and we are to forecast without missing? \n We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we output 96 values without missing.\n\n However, the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning we should handle missing values in the input? But the input we are given does not have missing values.\n\n So we proceed.\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's recalculate and round:\n\n 00:00: (0.883+0.822+0.761+0.944)/4 = 3.41/4 = 0.8525 -> 0.853\n 01:00: (0.822+0.701+0.731+0.761)/4 = 3.015/4 = 0.75375 -> 0.754\n 02:00: (0.944+0.822+0.701+0.670)/4 = 3.137/4 = 0.78425 -> 0.784\n 03:00: (0.883+0.792+0.761+0.731)/4 = 3.167/4 = 0.79175 -> 0.792\n 04:00: (0.761+0.761+0.822+0.761)/4 = 3.105/4 = 0.77625 -> 0.776\n 05:00: (0.975+0.883+0.975+0.914)/4 = 3.747/4 = 0.93675 -> 0.937\n 06:00: (1.157+0.853+0.883+0.914)/4 = 3.807/4 = 0.95175 -> 0.952\n 07:00: (1.371+1.005+1.005+1.097)/4 = 4.478/4 = 1.1195 -> 1.120\n 1.1195 rounded to 3 decimals is 1.120? But note: 1.1195 is 1.120 when rounded to 3 decimals? Actually, 1.1195 rounded to 3 decimals is 1.120? \n But let's check: 1.1195 -> the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up: 1.120.\n\n 08:00: (1.401+1.157+1.127+1.340)/4 = 5.025/4 = 1.25625 -> 1.256\n 09:00: (1.340+0.975+1.157+1.157)/4 = 4.629/4 = 1.15725 -> 1.157\n 10:00: (1.401+0.883+1.157+1.218)/4 = 4.659/4 = 1.16475 -> 1.165\n 11:00: (1.492+0.853+0.944+1.097)/4 = 4.386/4 = 1.0965 -> 1.097\n 12:00: (1.127+0.944+0.944+1.340)/4 = 4.355/4 = 1.08875 -> 1.089\n 13:00: (0.975+0.853+0.731+1.127)/4 = 3.686/4 = 0.9215 -> 0.922\n 14:00: (1.066+0.944+1.036+1.097)/4 = 4.143/4 = 1.03575 -> 1.036\n 15:00: (1.036+0.944+1.218+0.944)/4 = 4.142/4 = 1.0355 -> 1.036\n 1.0355 rounded to 3 decimals: 1.036? Because 1.0355 -> the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal from 5 to 6? \n But note: 1.0355: the third decimal is 5 and the fourth is 5, so we round up the 5 to 6? Actually, 1.0355 is exactly halfway between 1.035 and 1.036. \n According to rounding rules, we round to the nearest even? But in practice, we round 5 up. So 1.036.\n\n 16:00: (1.066+1.188+1.157+1.066)/4 = 4.477/4 = 1.11925 -> 1.119\n 17:00: (0.944+0.853+1.036+0.853)/4 = 3.686/4 = 0.9215 -> 0.922\n 18:00: (0.853+0.975+1.127+0.853)/4 = 3.808/4 = 0.952 -> 0.952\n 19:00: (0.822+0.975+0.975+0.761)/4 = 3.533/4 = 0.88325 -> 0.883\n 20:00: (0.853+1.005+1.371+1.097)/4 = 4.326/4 = 1.0815 -> 1.082\n 21:00: (0.761+0.975+1.036+1.005)/4 = 3.777/4 = 0.94425 -> 0.944\n 22:00: (0.761+0.914+1.310+0.914)/4 = 3.899/4 = 0.97475 -> 0.975\n 23:00: (0.731+0.975+0.883+0.944)/4 = 3.533/4 = 0.88325 -> 0.883\n\n Now, we have 24 values for a typical day.\n\n We'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n  Day 1: 2017-09-10: [00:00 to 23:00] -> the 24 values above\n  Day 2: 2017-09-11: same 24 values\n  Day 3: 2017-09-12: same 24 values\n  Day 4: 2017-09-13: same 24 values\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n  2017-09-10 00:00:00\n  2017-09-10 01:00:00\n  ...\n  2017-09-10 23:00:00\n  2017-09-11 00:00:00\n  ...\n  2017-09-13 23:00:00\n\n We'll write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the given data is hourly. So we are forecasting hourly.\n\n We'll output the data in the same hourly frequency.\n\n Let's write the data.\n\n Important: the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates. We are providing 96 rows.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\ndate,LULL\n2017-09-10 00:00:00,0.853\n2017-09-10 01:00:00,0.754\n2017-09-10 02:00:00,0.784\n2017-09-10 03:00:00,0.792\n2017-09-10 04:00:00,0.776\n2017-09-10 05:00:00,0.937\n2017-09-10 06:00:00,0.952\n2017-09-10 07:00:00,1.120\n2017-09-10 08:00:00,1.256\n2017-09-10 09:00:00,1.157\n2017-09-10 10:00:00,1.165\n2017-09-10 11:00:00,1.097\n2017-09-10 12:00:00,1.089\n2017-09-10 13:00:00,0.922\n2017-09-10 14:00:00,1.036\n2017-09-10 15:00:00,1.036\n2017-09-10 16:00:00,1.119\n2017-09-10 17:00:00,0.922\n2017-09-10 18:00:00,0.952\n2017-09-10 19:00:00,0.883\n2017-09-10 20:00:00,1.082\n2017-09-10 21:00:00,0.944\n2017-09-10 22:00:00,0.975\n2017-09-10 23:00:00,0.883\n2017-09-11 00:00:00,0.853\n2017-09-11 01:00:00,0.754\n... and so on until 2017-09-13 23:00:00\n\n We'll generate the next 4 days by repeating the same 24 values 4 times.\n\n But note: we must not omit any content. So we write all 96 rows.\n\n However, to save space, we can write a loop in the output? But the problem says to provide the complete data. So we write all 96 rows.\n\n But the answer format requires to be in a code block.\n\n We'll write a code block with 96 lines.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data is in the format:\n\n        date  LULL\n\n But in the example, it's two columns without a comma? Actually, the example uses spaces. But the problem says \"the complete data\" and the format we are to follow is the same as the input? \n\n The input was:\n\n               date  LULL\n2017-09-06 00:00:00 0.883\n\n So we have a space separated? Actually, it's aligned with spaces? But for machine readability, we can output as CSV? \n\n But the problem does not specify. However, the example input was given without commas.
