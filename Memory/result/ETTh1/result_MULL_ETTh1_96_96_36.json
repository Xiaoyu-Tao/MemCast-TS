        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, the provided sample is complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency and the relatively short history (4 days), we can consider a model that captures:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Possibly some trend, but the data is short so we must be cautious.\n\n 3. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, we will generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 4. We choose a method: Given the constraints, we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code, we must use a simple method.\n    However, note that the problem states we are an expert. We can use a simple averaging method with seasonality.\n\n    Approach:\n    - We observe that the data seems to have a daily pattern. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we use the average of the same hour from the historical days.\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level per day:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-11-22): average MULL = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: similarly\n        Day 3: \n        Day 4:\n\n    We can compute:\n\n        Day1: 3.802, 3.163, 3.340, 3.411, 3.198, 2.487, 2.985, 2.736, 3.944, 2.487, 1.812, 2.416, 2.061, 2.559, 2.523, 1.919, 1.741, 1.706, 1.706, 1.173, 1.208, 0.178, 2.665, 3.092\n        Average Day1: (sum of above)/24 \u2248 2.42 (roughly)\n\n        Similarly, we can compute for the other days, but note that the pattern might be shifting.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the available days. Since we have 4 days, we can take the average of each hour across the 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the last day (2016-11-25) ends at 2.523 at 23:00. We have 4 days of data for each hour.\n\n    Steps for forecasting:\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): we have [3.802, 3.802, 3.447, 2.025] for the 4 days -> average = (3.802+3.802+3.447+2.025)/4 = 13.076/4 = 3.269\n        For hour 1 (01:00): [3.163, 3.767, 3.767, 2.665] -> (3.163+3.767+3.767+2.665)/4 = 13.362/4 = 3.3405\n\n    But wait, the last day (2016-11-25) only has 24 hours? Actually, the data we have for 2016-11-25 starts at 00:00 and ends at 23:00, so we have 4 full days.\n\n    However, note that the data for 2016-11-25 00:00:00 is 2.025? Actually, looking at the data:\n\n        2016-11-25 00:00:00 2.025? \n        But the data for 2016-11-25 starts with:\n            2016-11-25 00:00:00 2.025\n            2016-11-25 01:00:00 2.665\n            ...\n\n        So we have 4 days: \n          Day1: 2016-11-22\n          Day2: 2016-11-23\n          Day3: 2016-11-24\n          Day4: 2016-11-25\n\n    We can create a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours). Then for each hour h in [0,23], we compute the average of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a trend or a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (consecutive, and they are from Tuesday to Saturday?).\n\n    Since we are only given 4 days, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we rely on daily seasonality.\n\n    But what if there is a trend? We might consider a simple adjustment: we can compute the average for each hour and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day as a base and adjust by the average hourly pattern? \n\n    However, the problem is we are only allowed to use the given 96 points.\n\n    Let's do:\n\n        We compute the average for each hour of the day (over the 4 days) and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the data might be non-stationary. We have to be cautious.\n\n    Another idea: use the average of the last two days for each hour? because the last two days might be more representative? \n\n    However, the problem does not specify. We'll go with the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        Let H0, H1, ... H23 be the average for hour 0,1,...,23 over the 4 days.\n\n        Then the forecast for:\n          2016-11-26 00:00:00 -> H0\n          2016-11-26 01:00:00 -> H1\n          ... \n          2016-11-26 23:00:00 -> H23\n          2016-11-27 00:00:00 -> H0\n          ... and so on for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n    How to compute H0? \n        Hour0: \n          2016-11-22 00:00:00: 3.802\n          2016-11-23 00:00:00: 3.802\n          2016-11-24 00:00:00: 3.447\n          2016-11-25 00:00:00: 2.025\n          H0 = (3.802 + 3.802 + 3.447 + 2.025) / 4 = 13.076 / 4 = 3.269\n\n    Similarly for H1, ... H23.\n\n    But note: the data might have missing values? The provided data does not have missing values. So we are safe.\n\n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n    We must generate 96 data points for the next 4 days.\n\n    Let's compute all 24 hourly averages:\n\n        H0: (3.802, 3.802, 3.447, 2.025) -> 3.269\n        H1: (3.163, 3.767, 3.767, 2.665) -> (3.163+3.767+3.767+2.665)/4 = 13.362/4 = 3.3405\n        H2: (3.340, 4.264, 3.625, 2.168) -> (3.340+4.264+3.625+2.168)/4 = 13.397/4 = 3.34925\n        H3: (3.411, 3.802, 3.873, 2.665) -> (3.411+3.802+3.873+2.665)/4 = 13.751/4 = 3.43775\n        H4: (3.198, 4.300, 3.411, 2.452) -> (3.198+4.300+3.411+2.452)/4 = 13.361/4 = 3.34025\n        H5: (2.487, 4.158, 3.589, 2.203) -> (2.487+4.158+3.589+2.203)/4 = 12.437/4 = 3.10925\n        H6: (2.985, 3.873, 2.559, 1.954) -> (2.985+3.873+2.559+1.954)/4 = 11.371/4 = 2.84275\n        H7: (2.736, 3.447, 3.660, 2.701) -> (2.736+3.447+3.660+2.701)/4 = 12.544/4 = 3.136\n        H8: (3.944, 3.376, 3.198, 3.340) -> (3.944+3.376+3.198+3.340)/4 = 13.858/4 = 3.4645\n        H9: (2.487, 1.492, 2.559, 2.381) -> (2.487+1.492+2.559+2.381)/4 = 8.919/4 = 2.22975\n        H10: (1.812, 2.097, 2.168, 2.630) -> (1.812+2.097+2.168+2.630)/4 = 8.707/4 = 2.17675\n        H11: (2.416, 2.168, 2.701, 2.630) -> (2.416+2.168+2.701+2.630)/4 = 9.915/4 = 2.47875\n        H12: (2.061, 1.777, 1.244, 1.102) -> (2.061+1.777+1.244+1.102)/4 = 6.184/4 = 1.546\n        H13: (2.559, 1.741, 2.416, 1.919) -> (2.559+1.741+2.416+1.919)/4 = 8.635/4 = 2.15875\n        H14: (2.523, 2.949, 2.701, 3.411) -> (2.523+2.949+2.701+3.411)/4 = 11.584/4 = 2.896\n        H15: (1.919, 3.163, 2.985, 2.381) -> (1.919+3.163+2.985+2.381)/4 = 10.448/4 = 2.612\n        H16: (1.741, 2.025, 1.777, 2.416) -> (1.741+2.025+1.777+2.416)/4 = 7.959/4 = 1.98975\n        H17: (1.706, 1.315, 1.635, 1.883) -> (1.706+1.315+1.635+1.883)/4 = 6.539/4 = 1.63475\n        H18: (1.706, 1.635, 1.031, 1.279) -> (1.706+1.635+1.031+1.279)/4 = 5.651/4 = 1.41275\n        H19: (1.173, 1.315, 1.528, 1.670) -> (1.173+1.315+1.528+1.670)/4 = 5.686/4 = 1.4215\n        H20: (1.208, 1.208, 1.741, 1.635) -> (1.208+1.208+1.741+1.635)/4 = 5.792/4 = 1.448\n        H21: (0.178, 0.924, 1.031, 1.706) -> (0.178+0.924+1.031+1.706)/4 = 3.839/4 = 0.95975\n        H22: (2.665, 1.457, 1.208, 2.381) -> (2.665+1.457+1.208+2.381)/4 = 7.711/4 = 1.92775\n        H23: (3.092, 3.447, 2.381, 2.523) -> (3.092+3.447+2.381+2.523)/4 = 11.443/4 = 2.86075\n\n    Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-26 (Saturday) -> hours 0 to 23: [H0, H1, ...

So we are using the same pattern for all days.\n\n    We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n    Format: \n        We must output the next 96 records in the same format as the input, but with the next 96 timestamps.\n\n    The last timestamp in the input is 2016-11-25 23:00:00.
