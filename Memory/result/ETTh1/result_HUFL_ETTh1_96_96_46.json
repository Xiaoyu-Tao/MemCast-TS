        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing. However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is a multi-step forecast) and the data is time-dependent, we can use a time series model.\n\n However, as an AI, I don't have the capability to run complex models in real-time, but I can use a simple method to generate a forecast.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use a naive method: \n   - We observe that the data has daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours). \n   - We can use the last available day (2017-01-04) as a template and adjust it slightly to generate the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend or other patterns. However, with only 4 days of data, it's hard to capture long-term trends.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days for each hour.\n\n Let's break the data into 4 days (each 24 hours). We have:\n   Day1: 2017-01-01\n   Day2: 2017-01-02\n   Day3: 2017-01-03\n   Day4: 2017-01-04\n\n We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the last day (2017-01-04) might be the most relevant. But without more data, we can use the average.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n   - For hour 0: average of [2017-01-01 00:00, 2017-01-02 00:00, 2017-01-03 00:00, 2017-01-04 00:00]\n   - Similarly for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2017-01-05 to 2017-01-08), we assign the average value for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values. In the provided data, we don't have missing, so we can proceed.\n\n However, if we look at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day. But for simplicity, we use the average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where recent days are more important? But without more context, we use simple average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (12.927 + 7.636 + 10.918 + 7.904) / 4 = (12.927+7.636+10.918+7.904)/4 = 39.385/4 = 9.84625\n   hour1: (13.798 + 7.636 + 11.922 + 8.306) / 4 = (13.798+7.636+11.922+8.306)/4 = 41.662/4 = 10.4155\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for 2017-01-04 00:00:00 is 7.904, which is the first hour of that day.\n\n However, we are to forecast 4 days. So we will repeat the same 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n But wait, the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not told about any in the provided 96, so we assume complete.\n\n However, the forecast must be for 96 points. We'll generate 4 days of 24 hours each.\n\n But note: the last provided data point is 2017-01-04 23:00:00 (which is 11.387). The next point is 2017-01-05 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   Day 5 (2017-01-05): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... avg_hour23]\n   Day 6 (2017-01-06): same as above\n   Day 7 (2017-01-07): same\n   Day 8 (2017-01-08): same\n\n However, this method ignores any trend. We can try to adjust for a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing or ARIMA. But without running code, we have to use a simple method.\n\n Given the instructions, I will compute the average for each hour and then output 4 days of that.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\".\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour0: (12.927, 7.636, 10.918, 7.904) -> 9.84625\n   hour1: (13.798, 7.636, 11.922, 8.306) -> 10.4155\n   hour2: (13.597, 7.435, 11.454, 8.640) -> 10.2815\n   hour3: (13.195, 7.703, 11.989, 9.511) -> 10.5995\n   hour4: (14.468, 7.368, 12.458, 8.774) -> 10.767\n   hour5: (13.597, 8.506, 10.985, 8.439) -> 10.38175\n   hour6: (14.602, 6.899, 12.793, 9.243) -> 10.88425\n   hour7: (14.669, 9.846, 13.463, 12.391) -> 12.59225\n   hour8: (11.454, 10.315, 12.860, 11.186) -> 11.45375\n   hour9: (8.239, 9.310, 9.377, 8.573) -> 8.87475\n   hour10: (7.301, 8.506, 7.770, 9.042) -> 8.15475\n   hour11: (7.971, 8.975, 7.770, 9.846) -> 8.6405\n   hour12: (3.952, 5.693, 4.555, 7.234) -> 5.3585\n   hour13: (4.354, 6.765, 4.689, 7.368) -> 5.794\n   hour14: (5.224, 5.626, 5.894, 7.502) -> 6.0615\n   hour15: (6.631, 6.832, 5.693, 8.105) -> 6.81525\n   hour16: (7.569, 7.301, 6.832, 8.172) -> 7.4685\n   hour17: (9.310, 9.645, 8.908, 9.980) -> 9.46075\n   hour18: (9.176, 9.511, 8.640, 9.511) -> 9.2095\n   hour19: (9.377, 9.176, 9.042, 9.444) -> 9.25975\n   hour20: (8.975, 8.573, 8.372, 8.372) -> 8.573\n   hour21: (7.770, 8.172, 7.301, 7.234) -> 7.61925\n   hour22: (7.569, 10.516, 8.038, 10.717) -> 9.210\n   hour23: (7.569, 10.985, 9.980, 11.387) -> 9.98025\n\n Now, we will create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the above 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n The dates will be:\n   2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-05 23:00:00\n   2017-01-06 00:00:00 to 2017-01-06 23:00:00\n   2017-01-07 00:00:00 to 2017-01-07 23:00:00\n   2017-01-08 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00\n\n We'll assign the values for each hour as computed above.\n\n However, note: the average we computed is for the first four days. We are using the same pattern for the next four.\n\n But we must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and HUFL) and 96 rows.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-05 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-01-05 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n\n We'll create a list of dates and then assign the HUFL values by cycling through the 24-hour averages.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-01-05 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n   HUFL_forecast = [9.84625, 10.4155, 10.2815, 10.5995, 10.767, 10.38175, 10.88425, 12.59225, 11.45375, 8.87475, 8.15475, 8.6405, 5.3585, 5.794, 6.0615, 6.81525, 7.4685, 9.46075, 9.2095, 9.25975, 8.573, 7.61925, 9.210, 9.98025] * 4\n\n But note: the *4 will repeat the same 24 values 4 times.\n\n However, we must format the output exactly as the input, with the same precision (3 decimal places).\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the exact computed value without rounding? But the input has 3 decimals.\n\n Let's round to 3 decimals.\n\n   hour0: 9.846 -> 9.846 (but we have 9.84625 -> 9.846)\n   Actually, we should round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n But note: the example input has 3 decimal places.\n\n Let me recalc and round:\n\n   hour0: 9.84625 -> 9.846\n   hour1: 10.4155 -> 10.416 (rounding: 10.4155 -> 10.416 because 5 rounds up)\n   hour2: 10.2815 -> 10.282\n   hour3: 10.5995 -> 10.600\n   hour4: 10.767 -> 10.767\n   hour5: 10.38175 -> 10.382\n   hour6: 10.88425 -> 10.884\n   hour7: 12.59225 -> 12.592\n   hour8: 11.45375 -> 11.454\n   hour9: 8.87475 -> 8.875\n   hour10: 8.15475 -> 8.155\n   hour11: 8.6405 -> 8.641\n   hour12: 5.3585 -> 5.359\n   hour13: 5.794 -> 5.794\n   hour14: 6.0615 -> 6.062\n   hour15: 6.81525 -> 6.815\n   hour16: 7.4685 -> 7.469\n   hour17: 9.46075 -> 9.461\n   hour18: 9.2095 -> 9.210\n   hour19: 9.25975 -> 9.260\n   hour20: 8.573 -> 8.573\n   hour21: 7.61925 -> 7.619\n   hour22: 9.210 -> 9.210\n   hour23: 9.98025 -> 9.980\n\n But note: the input has 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n However, let's check the rounding for hour1: 10.4155 -> 10.416? \n   Actually, 10.4155 rounded to 3 decimals: \n        look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal (which is 5) becomes 6 -> 10.416.\n\n But note: the input sometimes has 3 decimal places without trailing zeros? We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll create the list of HUFL values for the next 96 hours by repeating the rounded 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the pattern might not be exactly the same for each day? But we are using the same pattern.\n\n Let's write the data:\n\n   First 24 hours (2017-01-05):\n        2017-01-05 00:00:00  9.846\n        2017-01-05 01:00:00 10.416\n        2017-01-05 02:00:00 10.282\n        ... until 2017-01-05 23:00:00 9.980\n\n   Then the same for 2017-01-06, 2017-01-07, 2017-01-08.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are generating without missing.\n\n We are to output 96 rows.\n\n We'll format the date as in the input: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n Now, we write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the input data has a space between the date and time.
