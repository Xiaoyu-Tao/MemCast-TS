        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has negative values and shows some daily seasonality (patterns repeating every 24 hours).\n 3. We are to account for possible missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 points does not have any missing values in the given snippet.\n 4. However, for the forecast, we must generate 96 complete data points without any missing.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data exhibits seasonality, we can use a seasonal time series model. \n Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex model fitting, but we can use a simple method such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, and then repeat for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's observe the last few days:\n\n  We have data from 2017-06-10 to 2017-06-13 (4 days). We can take the last 24 hours (2017-06-13 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. However, in the provided data we don't have missing. So for the next 96, we are to generate without missing.\n\n However, the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning we should handle missing in the input? But the input provided does not have missing. So we proceed.\n\n But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" - it might be that the provided data has missing? But in the given 96 points, there are no missing. So we assume the provided 96 are complete.\n\n We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a simple seasonal naive method: \n   Let the last 24 hours (from 2017-06-13 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) be our base pattern.\n\n   Then the forecast for:\n        2017-06-14 00:00:00 = 2017-06-13 00:00:00\n        2017-06-14 01:00:00 = 2017-06-13 01:00:00\n        ... until 2017-06-14 23:00:00 = 2017-06-13 23:00:00\n\n   Then for the next day (2017-06-15) we use the same pattern again? But note: the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and the pattern might be consistent.\n\n However, we can also consider the possibility of a slight trend? But without more data, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for generating the next 96 points:\n\n   Start from: 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00 (4 days)\n\n   We take the last 24 hours of the provided data (which is 2017-06-13 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n   But note: the last day (2017-06-13) data:\n\n        2017-06-13 00:00:00 -0.579\n        2017-06-13 01:00:00 -0.487\n        2017-06-13 02:00:00 -0.487\n        2017-06-13 03:00:00 -0.426\n        2017-06-13 04:00:00 -0.457\n        2017-06-13 05:00:00 -0.335\n        2017-06-13 06:00:00 -0.305\n        2017-06-13 07:00:00 -0.091\n        2017-06-13 08:00:00 -0.061\n        2017-06-13 09:00:00 -0.091\n        2017-06-13 10:00:00 -0.152\n        2017-06-13 11:00:00 -0.183\n        2017-06-13 12:00:00 -0.457\n        2017-06-13 13:00:00 -0.213\n        2017-06-13 14:00:00 -0.305\n        2017-06-13 15:00:00 -0.396\n        2017-06-13 16:00:00 -0.487\n        2017-06-13 17:00:00 -0.609\n        2017-06-13 18:00:00 -0.670\n        2017-06-13 19:00:00 -0.579\n        2017-06-13 20:00:00 -0.426\n        2017-06-13 21:00:00 -0.457\n        2017-06-13 22:00:00 -0.548\n        2017-06-13 23:00:00 -0.670\n\n   We will repeat this pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   So the first 24 hours of the forecast (2017-06-14) will be the same as above.\n\n   Then 2017-06-15: same as above, and so on.\n\n   We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   The last provided date is 2017-06-13 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-06-14 00:00:00.\n\n   We generate 96 records:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-14 23:00:00 -> same as 2017-06-13 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-06-15 00:00:00 to 2017-06-15 23:00:00 -> same as above\n        Day 3: 2017-06-16 00:00:00 to 2017-06-16 23:00:00 -> same\n        Day 4: 2017-06-17 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00 -> same\n\n   Therefore, we have 4 repetitions of the last 24-hour pattern.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of the last 24 values from the provided data.\n\n   Then, we'll generate the next 96 dates by starting from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 and adding 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n   The LULL for each hour of the day will be taken from the corresponding hour of the last available day (2017-06-13).\n\n   Specifically:\n        For 2017-06-14 00:00:00 -> use the value of 2017-06-13 00:00:00 (-0.579)\n        For 2017-06-14 01:00:00 -> use the value of 2017-06-13 01:00:00 (-0.487)\n        ... \n        For 2017-06-14 23:00:00 -> use the value of 2017-06-13 23:00:00 (-0.670)\n\n        Then for 2017-06-15 00:00:00 -> again use the value of 2017-06-13 00:00:00 (-0.579)\n        and so on.\n\n   We do this for 4 full cycles.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. \n And for the forecast, we are generating without missing.\n\n We are to output in the required format.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n        date                 LULL\n        2017-06-14 00:00:00 -0.579\n        2017-06-14 01:00:00 -0.487\n        ... \n        (96 lines)\n\n    </answer>\n\n We'll generate the next 96 dates and the corresponding LULL values.\n\n Steps for generating the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-06-13 23:00:00 is the last given. So next is 2017-06-14 00:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        import pandas as pd  # But note: we cannot use external libraries? The problem doesn't specify, but we are to output text.\n\n   However, we are to output as text. We can generate the dates by:\n\n        base_date = \"2017-06-14 00:00:00\"\n        then add 0,1,2,...,95 hours.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        start_date = pd.Timestamp(\"2017-06-14 00:00:00\")\n        dates = [start_date + pd.Timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n   But since we are in a text-based environment and cannot use pandas, we can generate the dates manually.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the dates are in a fixed format.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        year = 2017\n        month = 6\n        day: starting at 14, then 15, 16, 17, and then 18?
