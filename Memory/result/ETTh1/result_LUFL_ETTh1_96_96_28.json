        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). There are also some irregularities and a negative value on 2016-10-21 23:00:00 which might be an outlier or missing value indicator? But the problem says there are missing values, however in the provided data we don't see any explicit missing (but the last value of the first day is negative, which is unusual).\n\n 2. Since the data has seasonality, we can use a seasonal time series model. Given the small amount of data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the value from the same hour in the previous day (or the last available season).\n    - However, we have 4 days of data, so we can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days? But note that the pattern might change.\n\n 3. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. However, the provided 96 points do not have any explicit NaN. The negative value might be an anomaly? We have to be cautious.\n\n 4. Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a complete forecast for 96 points, we can use a simple method that handles seasonality.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We observe that the data has a daily pattern: low during the night, then a peak in the morning (around 7-8 AM) and then fluctuations during the day.\n    - We can use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the last day (2016-10-24) has a different pattern? Let's check the same hour across days:\n\n    Example for hour 0: \n        2016-10-21: 3.625\n        2016-10-22: 1.066\n        2016-10-23: 1.401\n        2016-10-24: 3.807\n\n    The variation is high. Alternatively, we can use the last season (i.e., the previous day) as the forecast? But the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data we don't have missing.\n\n 6. Considering the negative value on 2016-10-21 23:00:00, it might be an anomaly. We can replace it with the average of the same hour from the other days? But for forecasting, we are not going to alter the historical data unless we are modeling. However, for simplicity, we will use the provided data as is.\n\n 7. We decide to use a seasonal naive method that uses the last available season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) for forecasting. But note: the last day (2016-10-24) has a value for each hour. So we can use the values from 2016-10-24 to forecast 2016-10-25? However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 dates, which would be from 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00).\n\n    But wait: the last date is 2016-10-24 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n        2016-10-25 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-10-28 23:00:00\n\n 8. How to handle the negative value? We note that the value at 2016-10-21 23:00:00 is -1.188. Then the next day (2016-10-22) at 23:00:00 is 1.462, and then 1.432 on 2016-10-23, and 1.432 on 2016-10-24. We can use the value from the same hour of the previous day (2016-10-24) for the first forecasted day? \n\n    However, the pattern might be changing. Alternatively, we can take the average of the last 3 days for the same hour? But the first day has an anomaly.\n\n 9. We decide to use the last day (2016-10-24) as the template for the next day? But that might not capture the weekly pattern? We only have 4 days, so we don't know weekly.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will use the Seasonal Naive method with the last season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) for each hour. So:\n\n        Forecast for 2016-10-25 00:00:00 = value of 2016-10-24 00:00:00 -> 3.807\n        Forecast for 2016-10-25 01:00:00 = value of 2016-10-24 01:00:00 -> 3.686\n        ... until 2016-10-25 23:00:00 = value of 2016-10-24 23:00:00 -> 1.432\n\n     Then for 2016-10-26, we would use the forecast from 2016-10-25? But we don't have observed data for 2016-10-25. So we use the same pattern: we use the forecast from the previous day (which is the same as 2016-10-24) for 2016-10-26? That would be identical to 2016-10-24 again.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the same 24-hour pattern from 2016-10-24 for all 4 days? That is, the next 96 hours are just 4 repetitions of the last day (2016-10-24).\n\n 11. But note: the data shows that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. However, without more data, we cannot capture a trend. So repeating the last day's pattern for the next 4 days is a simple and common approach.\n\n 12. Therefore, we will generate the next 96 hours by repeating the last 24 hours (2016-10-24) four times.\n\n 13. How to generate the dates?\n        Start: 2016-10-25 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-10-24 23:00:00)\n        End: 2016-10-25 23:00:00 (first day), then 2016-10-26 00:00:00 to 23:00:00, etc. until 96 hours.\n\n     Actually, 96 hours is 4 days.\n\n 14. Steps for generating the forecast:\n        Let last_day = the data for 2016-10-24 (which has 24 hours: index 72 to 95 in the given 96 points)\n        Then we repeat this last_day 4 times.\n\n 15. The last_day data (2016-10-24) is:\n\n        2016-10-24 00:00:00  3.807\n        2016-10-24 01:00:00  3.686\n        2016-10-24 02:00:00  3.625\n        2016-10-24 03:00:00  3.564\n        2016-10-24 04:00:00  3.594\n        2016-10-24 05:00:00  3.807\n        2016-10-24 06:00:00  4.325\n        2016-10-24 07:00:00  4.904\n        2016-10-24 08:00:00  2.467\n        2016-10-24 09:00:00  2.224\n        2016-10-24 10:00:00  2.345\n        2016-10-24 11:00:00  3.015\n        2016-10-24 12:00:00  2.254\n        2016-10-24 13:00:00  1.919\n        2016-10-24 14:00:00  2.041\n        2016-10-24 15:00:00  1.919\n        2016-10-24 16:00:00  2.041\n        2016-10-24 17:00:00  2.619\n        2016-10-24 18:00:00  2.498\n        2016-10-24 19:00:00  2.254\n        2016-10-24 20:00:00  1.980\n        2016-10-24 21:00:00  1.706\n        2016-10-24 22:00:00  1.492\n        2016-10-24 23:00:00  1.432\n\n 16. We will create 4 copies of these 24 values for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. The dates for the next 96 hours (starting from 2016-10-25 00:00:00) can be generated by:\n\n        base_date = 2016-10-25 00:00:00\n        Then we add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n 18. We output the date and the forecasted LUFL value.\n\n 19. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, with two columns: \"date\" and \"LUFL\", and the date format as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 20. We write the complete 96 forecasted points.\n\n 21. Note: The problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Let last_day = [3.807, 3.686, 3.625, 3.564, 3.594, 3.807, 4.325, 4.904, 2.467, 2.224, 2.345, 3.015, 2.254, 1.919, 2.041, 1.919, 2.041, 2.619, 2.498, 2.254, 1.980, 1.706, 1.492, 1.432]\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is: 4 repetitions of last_day.\n\n    The dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-25 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2016-10-26 00:00:00 to 2016-10-26 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2016-10-27 00:00:00 to 2016-10-27 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2016-10-28 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00\n\n 22. We generate the dates by starting at '2016-10-25 00:00:00' and then adding 1 hour for each step.\n\n 23. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 24. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided data we don't see any. We are forecasting without missing values.\n\n 25. We write the data in the answer block.\n\n Example of the first few forecasted points:\n\n        2016-10-25 00:00:00  3.807\n        2016-10-25 01:00:00  3.686\n        ...\n\n 26. We do 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n",
