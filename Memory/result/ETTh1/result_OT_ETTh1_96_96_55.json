        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hours of data (from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of oil temperature (OT).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing time points, but note that the user said \"these data will have missing values\". However, in the given 96 points, we have consecutive hourly data without gaps? Let's check the dates: \n    The data starts at 2017-02-06 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-02-09 23:00:00. \n    That's 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points. So the given data is complete? But the user says \"be aware of missing values\", so we must handle the possibility.\n\n    However, in the provided data, there are no missing timestamps? We have 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 2. But note: the data for 2017-02-08 has some zeros and negative values? For example:\n        2017-02-08 06:00:00  0.000\n        2017-02-08 08:00:00  0.000\n        2017-02-08 10:00:00  0.000\n        2017-02-08 11:00:00 -0.633\n\n    This might be actual recorded values? Or could be anomalies? The problem says \"missing values\", but these are recorded as numbers. We are not told that zeros are missing. So we treat them as observed.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 hours. The last timestamp is 2017-02-09 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data is hourly, we can use a time series model. Given the data shows daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours) and also some trend, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n    However, note that the data has some non-stationary behavior and possible anomalies (like the negative value and zeros). We must be cautious.\n\n    We can use:\n        - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because of the hourly data and daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n        - Or a machine learning model, but we are limited by the data (only 96 points for training data: 96 points, and we need to forecast 96 points. This is a lot of steps ahead.\n\n    Given the small data, we can try a simple model: Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or SARIMA.\n\n    But note: the data has a clear daily pattern? Let's observe:\n\n        The temperature tends to rise during the day and fall at night? But the pattern is not very clear because of the anomalies.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a model that is robust to missing values? But in the given data we don't have missing timestamps? The user said \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points we don't see any? So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n    However, for forecasting, we must generate 96 points without missing.\n\n 5. We will use a model that can handle the seasonality. Let's choose SARIMA.\n\n    Steps for SARIMA:\n        - Check stationarity: if not stationary, difference (d) and seasonal difference (D).\n        - Identify the orders (p,d,q) and seasonal orders (P,D,Q, s=24.\n\n    But with only 96 points, we cannot do a very complex model.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use an automated approach to select the best SARIMA parameters.\n\n 6. However, note: the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must output 96 data points.\n\n 7. Implementation:\n\n    We are not actually running code, but we have to simulate the output. Since we are an expert, we can describe the process and then generate the forecast.\n\n    But the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data.\" So we have to output 96 forecasted values.\n\n    How to generate without code? We can use a simple method: \n\n        - Since the data has a daily pattern, we can take the average of the same hour from the past 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n    However, the data has anomalies? For example, on 2017-02-08, the temperature dropped to 0 and negative. So we cannot rely on a simple average.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-09) and adjust by the difference between consecutive days? \n\n    But note: the problem does not require the method, only the output.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we are an expert, we can use a standard forecasting method and then output the result.\n\n    We'll use a simple model: \n\n        - We note that the temperature on 2017-02-09 is the most recent and seems to have recovered from the dip. We can assume that the next day (2017-02-10) will be similar to 2017-02-09 but with a slight upward or downward trend? \n\n        - However, we have 4 days of data. We can compute the average for each hour of the day and then use that as the pattern, and then adjust by the overall level of the last day.\n\n    Steps for a simple forecast:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n        Step 2: But the data has a trend? We can compute the average of the last day (2017-02-09) and the average of the entire series? Then adjust the pattern by the ratio? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day as the base and then add the average hourly deviation from the previous days? \n\n        However, we note that the data on 2017-02-08 is abnormal. So we might exclude that day? But we don't have enough data.\n\n        Step 3: We can use the average of the last two days (2017-02-08 and 2017-02-09) for the pattern? But 2017-02-08 is abnormal.\n\n        Step 4: Instead, we use the median for each hour over the 4 days to avoid the effect of outliers.\n\n    Let's the median for each hour:\n\n        We group by hour (0,1,...,23) and take the median of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n    Then, we can adjust the level: we can set the level to the average of the last 24 hours? Or we can use the last day's average? \n\n        We can compute the median pattern and then scale it so that the average of the pattern for the last day (2017-02-09) matches the actual average of that day? \n\n        Actually, we can use the pattern as the median and then shift the entire pattern by the average of the last 24 hours minus the average of the median pattern? \n\n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days? \n\n    However, there might be a trend? We don't have enough data to see a long-term trend. We can assume the level is constant? \n\n    So:\n\n        Let P(h) = median of hour h over the 4 days.\n\n        Then the forecast for day 5 (2017-02-10) at hour h: \n            = P(h) + (average of last day - average of P)\n\n        Similarly, for day 6,7,8? But we don't have information to project a trend. So we can use the same level for all 4 days? \n\n    However, the problem says to forecast 96 hours (4 days). We can use the same pattern for each day? \n\n    But note: the last day (2017-02-09) has a higher level? We can use the last day's level? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the median pattern without adjustment? \n\n    Let me compute the median for each hour from the given data:\n\n        Hour 0: [7.809, 4.573, 1.759, 6.964] -> sorted: [1.759, 4.573, 6.964, 7.809] -> median = (4.573+6.964)/2 = 5.7685\n        Hour 1: [6.753, 3.799, 2.392, 4.995] -> sorted: [2.392, 3.799, 4.995, 6.753] -> median = (3.799+4.995)/2 = 4.397\n        ... \n\n    This is tedious. We can do it in code in reality, but here we are simulating.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-09) as the pattern? Because it is the most recent and seems to have recovered. Then we assume the next days are the same? \n\n    But that would be 4 identical days? \n\n    The problem does not specify the method, so we choose a reasonable one.\n\n    We decide to use the median method:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the median for each hour (0-23) from the 4 days.\n\n        Step 2: Use this median for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    Why median? Because it is robust to outliers (like the drop on 2017-02-08).\n\n    However, we note that the temperature might be increasing or decreasing? The last day is higher? We don't have a clear trend.\n\n    We can also consider the overall average of the last 24 hours (2017-02-09) is about 6.5 (by quick look) and the median pattern we computed from 4 days might be around 5? Then we adjust by the difference? \n\n    Actually, we can set the level to the last day's average? \n\n        Let L = average of the last day (2017-02-09) = (6.964+4.995+5.698+6.613+6.402+3.166+5.065+5.276+3.728+5.346+6.824+7.035+6.613+7.809+6.402+5.909+6.894+7.668+7.809+7.949+7.668+8.442+8.231) / 24.\n\n        We don't have to compute exactly? We can approximate: let's say L \u2248 6.5.\n\n        And the average of the median pattern (over 24 hours) is M.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h on any future day: P(h) * (L / M)\n\n    But we don't have M? \n\n    Alternatively, we can shift the median pattern so that the average of the pattern for the last day is L? \n\n        We can set: \n            forecast for hour h = P(h) + (L - M)\n\n    But we don't know M until we compute P(h) for all h.\n\n    Since we are an expert and must output, we can compute the median pattern and then adjust by the difference between the last day's average and the average of the median pattern.\n\n    However, we are not doing the actual computation? We have to generate the numbers.\n\n    Given the constraints, we decide to use the median pattern without adjustment? \n\n    But then the level might be too low? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-09) as the pattern for the next day? Then for the following days, we can use the same pattern? \n\n    That is, the next 24 hours (2017-02-10) is the same as 2017-02-09? Then 2017-02-11 same as 2017-02-10? \n\n    But that would be constant? \n\n    We can assume the pattern repeats exactly? \n\n    However, the problem says to forecast\", so we can assume the pattern is stable? \n\n    But note: the data has a dip on 2017-02-08, so we don't want to repeat that. \n\n    We choose to use the median pattern without adjustment? \n\n    But we must output 96 numbers. \n\n    We decide to compute the median for each hour and then use that for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    How to compute the median for each hour?
