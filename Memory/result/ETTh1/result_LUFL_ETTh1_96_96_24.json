        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low Useful Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The data has a clear daily pattern: higher values during the night (especially around 6-7 AM) and lower during the day, with a dip around noon.\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a strong daily seasonality (period=24).\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any. However, we are warned that the data may have missing values.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (next 4 days).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple seasons) and we have a clear seasonal pattern, we can use a seasonal time series model.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days. We have very little history. This makes it challenging.\n\n Given the constraints, we must provide 96 forecasted values without any omission.\n\n We can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the day using the same hour from the last available day (or average of the same hour over the available days).\n   - But note: the pattern might be different by day of the week? We only have 4 days: from 2016-10-05 (Wednesday) to 2016-10-08 (Saturday). \n     The next 4 days would be: 2016-10-09 (Sunday) to 2016-10-12 (Wednesday). We don't have a full week of data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture the daily pattern and assume it repeats.\n\n But note: the data for 2016-10-07 (Friday) and 2016-10-08 (Saturday) might be different from weekdays? However, we don't have enough to model weekly seasonality.\n\n Let's try to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be the same pattern repeated.\n\n However, looking at the data, the pattern is similar but not exactly the same. The night peaks vary and the day values also vary.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) but with such a short history, it might not be robust.\n\n Given the challenge, I propose:\n   - We take the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days we have, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n   - Group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n But note: the data starts at 2016-10-05 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-10-08 23:00:00 (4 full days).\n\n We have 4 values for each hour (e.g., 00:00: 3.777, 4.203, 1.492, 3.929). We average these.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the first two days (Wed, Thu) might be weekdays and the next two (Fri, Sat) might be different? \n But without more data, we can only average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) to forecast Sunday? But we don't have a Sunday in the history). \n\n Since the problem does not specify the day of the week effect and we have only 4 days, we will use the average by hour.\n\n But note: the next 4 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? Actually:\n   2016-10-05: Wednesday\n   2016-10-06: Thursday\n   2016-10-07: Friday\n   2016-10-08: Saturday\n   Then:\n   2016-10-09: Sunday\n   2016-10-10: Monday? Actually, 2016-10-09 is Sunday, 2016-10-10 Monday, 2016-10-11 Tuesday, 2016-10-12 Wednesday.\n\n We don't have Sunday, Monday, Tuesday in the history. So we cannot use a weekly model.\n\n Therefore, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n However, note that the last day (Saturday) might be different? But we have to make an assumption.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour 00: (3.777 + 4.203 + 1.492 + 3.929) / 4 = (3.777+4.203=7.98; 7.98+1.492=9.472; 9.472+3.929=13.401) -> 13.401/4 = 3.35025\n   hour 01: (3.746+4.021+1.401+3.868)/4 = (3.746+4.021=7.767; 7.767+1.401=9.168; 9.168+3.868=13.036) -> 13.036/4 = 3.259\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. \n We are forecasting without knowing the future missing values? We are to provide 96 points without missing? So we just output 96 numbers.\n\n However, the problem says \"be aware of that\" meaning we might have to impute in the history? But the history provided is complete.\n\n So we proceed.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n Steps:\n   - Extract the hour from the datetime.\n   - Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n But note: the data is in order. We can reshape the 96 points into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the rows.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   hour00 = [3.777, 4.203, 1.492, 3.929] -> mean = 3.35025\n   hour01 = [3.746, 4.021, 1.401, 3.868] -> mean = 3.259\n   hour02 = [3.990, 4.082, 1.340, 3.868] -> mean = (3.990+4.082+1.340+3.868)/4 = 13.28/4 = 3.32\n   hour03 = [3.960, 4.021, 1.249, 3.868] -> (3.960+4.021+1.249+3.868)=13.098 -> 3.2745\n   hour04 = [3.868, 4.203, 1.279, 4.112] -> (3.868+4.203+1.279+4.112)=13.462 -> 3.3655\n   hour05 = [4.203, 4.295, 1.614, 4.264] -> (4.203+4.295+1.614+4.264)=14.376 -> 3.594\n   hour06 = [4.630, 4.965, 2.376, 4.782] -> (4.630+4.965+2.376+4.782)=16.753 -> 4.18825\n   hour07 = [4.843, 4.904, 2.559, 4.813] -> (4.843+4.904+2.559+4.813)=17.119 -> 4.27975\n   hour08 = [2.406, 2.284, 2.376, 2.224] -> (2.406+2.284+2.376+2.224)=9.29 -> 2.3225\n   hour09 = [2.498, 2.163, 2.498, 2.193] -> (2.498+2.163+2.498+2.193)=9.352 -> 2.338\n   hour10 = [2.619, 2.315, 2.467, 2.284] -> (2.619+2.315+2.467+2.284)=9.685 -> 2.42125\n   hour11 = [2.802, 2.650, 2.863, 2.376] -> (2.802+2.650+2.863+2.376)=10.691 -> 2.67275\n   hour12 = [1.919, 1.797, 2.163, 1.767] -> (1.919+1.797+2.163+1.767)=7.646 -> 1.9115\n   hour13 = [2.193, 1.980, 2.132, 1.980] -> (2.193+1.980+2.132+1.980)=8.285 -> 2.07125\n   hour14 = [1.919, 1.980, 2.041, 1.949] -> (1.919+1.980+2.041+1.949)=7.889 -> 1.97225\n   hour15 = [1.888, 1.706, 1.980, 1.858] -> (1.888+1.706+1.980+1.858)=7.432 -> 1.858\n   hour16 = [1.949, 2.254, 2.193, 1.980] -> (1.949+2.254+2.193+1.980)=8.376 -> 2.094\n   hour17 = [2.406, 2.833, 2.772, 2.467] -> (2.406+2.833+2.772+2.467)=10.478 -> 2.6195\n   hour18 = [2.102, 2.406, 2.315, 2.437] -> (2.102+2.406+2.315+2.437)=9.26 -> 2.315\n   hour19 = [2.254, 2.345, 2.071, 2.467] -> (2.254+2.345+2.071+2.467)=9.137 -> 2.28425\n   hour20 = [2.376, 2.193, 2.010, 2.193] -> (2.376+2.193+2.010+2.193)=8.772 -> 2.193\n   hour21 = [2.010, 1.858, 1.614, 1.797] -> (2.010+1.858+1.614+1.797)=7.279 -> 1.81975\n   hour22 = [1.828, 1.553, 1.279, 1.614] -> (1.828+1.553+1.279+1.614)=6.274 -> 1.5685\n   hour23 = [1.858, 1.645, 1.553, 1.371] -> (1.858+1.645+1.553+1.371)=6.427 -> 1.60675\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00) will be:\n\n   Day1 (2016-10-09, Sunday): [3.35025, 3.259, 3.32, 3.2745, 3.3655, 3.594, 4.18825, 4.27975, 2.3225, 2.338, 2.42125, 2.67275, 1.9115, 2.07125, 1.97225, 1.858, 2.094, 2.6195, 2.315, 2.28425, 2.193, 1.81975, 1.5685, 1.60675]\n   Day2 (2016-10-10, Monday): same 24 numbers\n   Day3 (2016-10-11, Tuesday): same\n   Day4 (2016-10-12, Wednesday): same\n\n But note: the last day in the history is 2016-10-08 (Saturday) and the next day is Sunday. We are using the same pattern for every day.\n\n However, we must generate the dates. The next date after 2016-10-08 23:00:00 is 2016-10-09 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2016-10-09 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-10-09 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-12 23:00:00.\n\n We'll be:\n\n   2016-10-09 00:00:00: 3.35025\n   2016-10-09 01:00:00: 3.259\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll round to 3 decimal places? The original data has 3 decimals. So we round the averages to 3 decimals.\n\n Let's recalculate and round:\n\n   hour00: 3.35025 -> 3.350\n   hour01: 3.259 -> 3.259\n   But note: 3.259 is already 3 decimals? Actually, we have to round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   hour00: (3.777+4.203+1.492+3.929)/4 = 13.401/4 = 3.35025 -> 3.350\n   hour01: (3.746+4.021+1.401+3.868)/4 = 13.036/4 = 3.259 -> 3.259\n   but 3.259 is exact?
