        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we have 24 points per day, so 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours). However, we only have 4 days, so it's limited.\n\n 4. Given the small data size, we can use a simple method like:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) as the forecast.\n    - But note: the data starts on 2016-07-25 and ends on 2016-07-28 (so we have 4 days). We can use the last day (2016-07-28) as the base for the next day?\n    However, we are to forecast the next 96 hours, which would be from 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00.\n\n 5. But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern? Let's check the first day and the last day:\n\n    First day (2016-07-25): \n        00:00: 2.559, 01:00: 2.416, ... 23:00: -0.817\n\n    Last day (2016-07-28):\n        00:00: 0.497, 01:00: 0.569, ... 23:00: 1.564\n\n    The pattern is not exactly repeating. Therefore, we might need a model that can capture the trend and seasonality.\n\n 6. Alternative approach: use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality. However, we have 4 days (only 4 seasons) which is very limited for seasonal models.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can use a moving average or a simple linear model? But the data has seasonality and possible non-linear patterns.\n\n 8. We can use a more robust method like Prophet by Facebook, which can handle seasonality and missing data, but we are not allowed to use external libraries? We are to provide the forecast without code.\n\n 9. Since we are to provide the forecast, we are the expert, we can simulate a forecast using a simple method and then output the data.\n\n 10. Considering the requirement and the simplicity, we can use a seasonal naive method with the last season (last day) but adjusted by the overall trend? \n\n    However, note that the last day (2016-07-28) is the 4th day and we are to forecast the 5th, 6th,7th,8th days? \n\n    But we have 4 days: \n        Day1: 2016-07-25\n        Day2: 2016-07-26\n        Day3: 2016-07-27\n        Day4: 2016-07-28\n\n    We are to forecast:\n        Day5: 2016-07-29\n        Day6: 2016-07-30\n        Day7: 2016-07-31\n        Day8: 2016-08-01\n\n    We can use the average of the last two days? or the last day? \n\n    Since the data is very short, we can see that the values on 2016-07-28 are generally higher than the previous days? \n\n    We can compute the average change from day to day and then project.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days? But 4 days is very few and the pattern might be changing.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are not given a clear method, we decide to use the last day (2016-07-28) as the base and then adjust by the average daily change.\n\n    Step:\n        - Compute the average of each day:\n            Day1 (07-25): average of 24 points = ?\n            Day2 (07-26): average of 24 points = ?\n            Day3 (07-27): average of 24 points = ?\n            Day4 (07-28): average of 24 points = ?\n\n        - Then compute the daily change: \n            change1 = (Day2 - Day1), change2 = (Day3 - Day2), change3 = (Day4 - Day3)\n            average_change = (change1 + change2 + change3) / 3\n\n        - Then for the next day (day5), we take the last day (day4) and add the average_change to each hour? \n          but that would be a constant shift. Alternatively, we can use the last day's value for the same hour and then add the average_change? \n\n        - However, we are forecasting 4 days. So for day5, we use day4's value at the same hour + average_change * 1?\n          for day6: day4's value at the same hour + average_change * 2? \n          for day7: day4's value at the same hour + average_change * 3?\n          for day8: day4's value at the same hour + average_change * 4?\n\n        But note: the average_change is the change in the daily average. We are applying a linear trend.\n\n 13. Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2016-07-25): \n            Sum = 2.559 + 2.416 + 2.487 + 2.381 + 1.244 + 1.528 + 0.817 + 0.320 -0.071 + 0.000 + 0.000 -2.025 + 0.320 -1.528 -1.741 -1.954 -1.528 -1.635 -1.812 -1.635 -1.244 -1.528 -0.711 -0.817\n            = -7.58 (approx) -> average = -7.58/24 = -0.3158\n\n        Day2 (2016-07-26):\n            Sum = -0.355 -0.249 -0.533 -1.208 -2.168 -2.168 -0.995 -1.244 -1.350 -0.782 -0.995 -1.492 -0.391 -1.741 -1.954 -1.599 -0.888 -0.675 -0.746 -0.711 +0.036 -0.853 +0.640 +0.640\n            = -19.58 (approx) -> average = -19.58/24 = -0.8158\n\n        Day3 (2016-07-27):\n            Sum = 0.640+0.533+0.569+0.355+0.391+0.320-0.284-0.178-0.604-0.355+0.000-0.036-0.711-0.604-0.355-0.213-0.284-0.604-0.888-0.817-0.178-0.782+0.355+1.066\n            = -0.18 (approx) -> average = -0.18/24 = -0.0075\n\n        Day4 (2016-07-28):\n            Sum = 0.497+0.569+1.031-0.036+0.355+0.604-1.066+0.000-0.640-0.142-0.142-0.284-1.102-0.391-0.640-0.569-0.391-0.746-0.604+0.533+0.604+0.249+0.888+1.564\n            = 0.5 (approx) -> average = 0.5/24 = 0.0208\n\n        Daily changes:\n            change1 = Day2 - Day1 = -0.8158 - (-0.3158) = -0.5\n            change2 = Day3 - Day2 = -0.0075 - (-0.8158) = 0.8083\n            change3 = Day4 - Day3 = 0.0208 - (-0.0075) = 0.0283\n\n        average_change = (-0.5 + 0.8083 + 0.0283) / 3 = 0.3366/3 = 0.1122\n\n        So the daily average is increasing by 0.1122 per day.\n\n 14. Now, we will forecast the next 4 days (96 hours) as:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in day (5,6,7,8) we do:\n\n          value(day5, h) = value(day4, h) + 1 * 0.1122\n          value(day6, h) = value(day4, h) + 2 * 0.1122\n          value(day7, h) = value(day4, h) + 3 * 0.1122\n          value(day8, h) = value(day4, h) + 4 * 0.1122\n\n        But note: this will add a constant shift per day, but the daily pattern is preserved.\n\n 15. However, we must note that the data might have a different scale? The daily average_change is 0.1122, but the values in a day can vary by several units.\n\n     This method might be too accurate? But given the data, it's a simple approach.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then add a trend? But we have 4 days, so we can compute the average for each hour and then add the daily trend multiplied by the day offset? \n\n     However, we are limited by the data.\n\n 17. We decide to use the above method (using the last day as base and adding a daily trend) because it's simple and we have a clear trend in the daily averages.\n\n 18. Let's compute the forecast:\n\n        Day5 (2016-07-29): \n            For hour 00:00: value = 0.497 (from 2016-07-28 00:00) + 0.1122 = 0.6092\n            For hour 01:00: value = 0.569 + 0.1122 = 0.6812\n            ... and so on.\n\n        Day6 (2016-07-30): \n            For hour 00:00: 0.497 + 2*0.1122 = 0.7214\n            ...\n\n        Day7 (2016-07-31): \n            For hour 00:00: 0.497 + 3*0.1122 = 0.8336\n\n        Day8 (2016-08-01): \n            For hour 00:00: 0.497 + 4*0.1122 = 0.9458\n\n 19. But note: the trend is applied to the daily average, but we are applying it to each hour? This might be acceptable.\n\n 20. However, we must be cautious: the daily average change is 0.1122, but we are adding 0.1122 to every hour? That means the daily average of the forecasted day5 would be the average of (day4's 24 hours + 0.1122) = (0.0208 + 0.1122) = 0.133, which is the daily average of day4 plus 0.1122. Similarly, day6: 0.0208 + 0.2244 = 0.2452, etc.\n\n 21. This method is consistent.\n\n 22. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00\n\n        We have the base day: 2016-07-28 (from 00:00 to 23:00) as:\n\n            00:00: 0.497\n            01:00: 0.569\n            02:00: 1.031\n            03:00: -0.036\n            04:00: 0.355\n            05:00: 0.604\n            06:00: -1.066\n            07:00: 0.000\n            08:00: -0.640\n            09:00: -0.142\n            10:00: -0.142\n            11:00: -0.284\n            12:00: -1.102\n            13:00: -0.391\n            14:00: -0.640\n            15:00: -0.569\n            16:00: -0.391\n            17:00: -0.746\n            18:00: -0.604\n            19:00: 0.533\n            20:00: 0.604\n            21:00: 0.249\n            22:00: 0.888\n            23:00: 1.564\n\n        Then for each day offset (1 to 4) we add (offset * 0.1122) to each hour.\n\n 23. We write the forecast in the same format.\n\n 24. However, note: the data provided ends at 2016-07-28 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours start at 2016-07-29 00:00:00 and end at 2016-08-01 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We generate:\n\n        Day1 of forecast (2016-07-29): offset=1 -> add 0.1122\n        Day2 (2016-07-30): offset=2 -> add 0.2244\n        Day3 (2016-07-31): offset=3 -> add 0.3366\n        Day4 (2016-08-01): offset=4 -> add 0.4488\n\n 26. We must be cautious: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n        The last date in the input is 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n        Then:\n            2016-07-29 00:00:00, 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00 -> day1\n            2016-07-30 00:00:00, ... -> day2\n            2016-07-31 00:00:00, ... -> day3\n            2016-08-01 00:00:00, ... 23:00:00 -> day4\n\n 27. We generate the data accordingly.\n\n 28. But note: the data has negative values and we are adding positive numbers? The trend is positive, so the values are increasing.\n\n 29. Let's do the first few:\n\n        For 2016-07-29 00:00:00: 0.497 + 0.1122 = 0.6092\n        For 2016-07-29 01:00:00: 0.569 + 0.1122 = 0.6812\n        For 2016-07-29 02:00:00: 1.031 + 0.1122 = 1.1432\n        For 2016-07-29 03:00:00: -0.036 + 0.1122 = 0.0762\n        ... and so on.\n\n 30. We do the same for the next days.\n\n 31. However, note: the method is very simplistic and may not capture the true dynamics, but given the data and the requirement, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 32. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 33. We must note: the original data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 34. Let's generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 35. We create a list of the base day (2016-07-28) 24 hours:\n\n        base_values = [0.497, 0.569, 1.031, -0.036, 0.355, 0.604, -1.066, 0.000, -0.640, -0.142, -0.142, -0.284, -1.102, -0.391, -0.640, -0.569, -0.391, -0.746, -0.604, 0.533, 0.604, 0.249, 0.888, 1.564]\n\n 36. Then for each day i (0 to 3) and for each hour j (0 to 23):\n\n        date = start_date + timedelta(days=i+1, hours=j)\n        value = base_values[j] + (i+1)*0.1122\n\n        Then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 37. The start date for the forecast is 2016-07-29 00:00:00.\n\n 38. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-07-29 00:00:00  0.609\n2016-07-29 01:00:00  0.681\n2016-07-29 02:00:00  1.143\n2016-07-29 03:00:00  0.076\n... \n```\n\n 39. We generate all 96 lines.\n\n 40. We note: the base day (2016-07-28) is the last day of the input, and we are using it as the template for the next 4 days.\n\n 41. Let's code the generation in our mind:\n\n        base = [0.497, 0.569, 1.031, -0.036, 0.355, 0.604, -1.066, 0.000, -0.640, -0.142, -0.142, -0.284, -1.102, -0.391, -0.640, -0.569, -0.391, -0.746, -0.604, 0.533, 0.604, 0.249, 0.888, 1.564]\n\n        dates = []\n        start = datetime(2016,7,29,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(4): # 4 days\n            for j in range(24): # 24 hours\n                date = start + timedelta(days=i, hours=j) # but note: for the first day, j from 0 to 23, then next day: i=1, then same j\n                # Actually, we can do:\n                #   date = start + timedelta(days=i) + timedelta(hours=j)\n                # But easier: for i in 0..95: \n                #   date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n        Alternatively, we can iterate 96 hours.\n\n        for k in range(96):\n            day_index = k // 24   # 0,1,2,3\n            hour_index = k % 24\n            value = base[hour_index] + (day_index+1)*0.1122\n            value = round(value, 3)\n\n 42. We do that.\n\n 43. But note: the base day is 2016-07-28, and we are forecasting 2016-07-29 (day_index=0: then add 1*0.1122) to base, then 2016-07-30 (day_index=1: then add 2*0.1122) etc.\n\n 44. We generate the dates:\n\n        k=0: 2016-07-29 00:00:00\n        k=1: 2016-07-29 01:00:00\n        ...\n        k=23: 2016-07-29 23:00:00\n        k=24: 2016-07-30 00:00:00\n        ... until k=95: 2016-08-01 23:00:00\n\n 45. We write the data.\n\n 46. However, note: the original data had negative values and we are adding positive numbers, so negative values become less negative.\n\n 47. We output the data.\n\n 48. But note: the method is very simple and might not be the best, but we are limited by the data and the requirement.\n\n 49. We must be cautious: the average daily change was computed as 0.1122, but the actual daily averages were:\n\n        Day1: -0.3158\n        Day2: -0.8158 -> change: -0.5\n        Day3: -0.0075 -> change: 0.8083\n        Day4: 0.0208 -> change: 0.0283\n\n        The average change 0.1122 is positive, but the changes were not consistent.
