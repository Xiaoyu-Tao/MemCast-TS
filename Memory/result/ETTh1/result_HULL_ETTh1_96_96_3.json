        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the HULL (High UseLess Load) from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-07-17 00:00:00 to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the input, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We must choose a forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (multi-step forecasting) and the data is at hourly frequency, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly patterns cannot be captured.\n    - Given the short history, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality. The data shows a clear daily cycle (with higher values at night and lower during the day?).\n\n 3. We'll use a simple model that can capture seasonality. Since we have only 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 96 points (next 4 days), we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive method: forecast each hour of the day by the same hour from the same day in the previous cycle? But we only have 4 days, so we can take the last day (day 4) and repeat it? \n      However, the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour across the available days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 4. Considering the data, we see that the values on 2016-07-16 (the last day) are generally lower than the previous days. It might be that the load is decreasing? \n    But without more context, we have to be cautious.\n\n 5. Given the requirement for a complete answer and the simplicity of the model, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data for the last day (2016-07-16) is incomplete? Actually, we have 24 hours for each day. The data provided is 4 full days (24*4=96).\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n      - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this average pattern 4 times.\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough to capture a trend. Alternatively, we can use the last day as the forecast if we believe the most recent day is the most representative.\n\n 6. Let's compare the days:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-07-13): [6.229, 5.894, ... , 4.622]\n    Day 2 (2016-07-14): [5.358, 4.555, ... , 2.545]\n    Day 3 (2016-07-15): [4.019, 4.287, ... , 2.679]\n    Day 4 (2016-07-16): [2.210, 3.081, ... , 1.808]\n\n    We see a decreasing trend? The values are generally lower each day.\n\n 7. Given the trend, we might want to use a method that accounts for trend. However, with only 4 days, it's challenging. We can try:\n\n    Option 1: Use the average of the same hour for the 4 days. This will smooth out the trend and might be more stable.\n\n    Option 2: Use the last day (2016-07-16) and adjust by the average change from day to day? But we don't have enough data for that.\n\n 8. We decide to use the average by hour. This will capture the daily pattern and average out the trend. However, if the trend is strong, the forecast might be higher than the actual.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day as the forecast for the next day, then the day before for the next, but that would be repeating the last 4 days? \n\n    But note: the problem says to forecast the next 96 recorded dates (which are 4 days). We are not given any information about holidays or events.\n\n 9. We choose the average by hour. Steps:\n\n    Let h in [0,23]:\n        avg_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n        Day 5: [avg_0, avg_1, ... , avg_23]\n        Day 6: [avg_0, avg_1, ... , avg_23]\n        Day 7: [avg_0, avg_1, ... , avg_23]\n        Day 8: [avg_0, avg_1, ... , avg_23]\n\n 10. However, we must note that the data might have missing values in the future? But the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. \n     We are generating the forecast without missing values.\n\n 11. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll index the data by hour of the day.\n\n     Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 6.229\n        Day2: 5.358\n        Day3: 4.019\n        Day4: 2.210\n        avg_0 = (6.229 + 5.358 + 4.019 + 2.210) / 4 = 17.816 / 4 = 4.454\n\n     Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: 5.894\n        Day2: 4.555\n        Day3: 4.287\n        Day4: 3.081\n        avg_1 = (5.894+4.555+4.287+3.081)/4 = 17.817/4 = 4.45425 -> 4.454\n\n     We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 12. Then we create the next 96 hours:\n\n     Start date: 2016-07-17 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2016-07-16)\n     Then 2016-07-17 01:00:00, ... until 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n 13. We must format the output exactly as the input, with the same number of decimal places (3 digits).\n\n 14. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are only given 96 complete points. We are generating the next 96 without missing values.\n\n 15. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n     We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 16. Code for averaging (we do it manually for 24 hours):\n\n     Hour 0: (6.229 + 5.358 + 4.019 + 2.210) / 4 = 17.816 / 4 = 4.454\n     Hour 1: (5.894 + 4.555 + 4.287 + 3.081) / 4 = 17.817 / 4 = 4.45425 -> 4.454\n     Hour 2: (5.961 + 3.885 + 4.354 + 3.751) / 4 = 17.951 / 4 = 4.48775 -> 4.488\n     Hour 3: (5.760 + 4.689 + 3.215 + 2.947) / 4 = 16.611 / 4 = 4.15275 -> 4.153\n     Hour 4: (7.100 + 3.684 + 3.416 + 2.009) / 4 = 16.209 / 4 = 4.05225 -> 4.052\n     Hour 5: (7.033 + 3.349 + 2.679 + 2.478) / 4 = 15.539 / 4 = 3.88475 -> 3.885\n     Hour 6: (4.823 + 3.684 + 2.009 + 2.210) / 4 = 12.726 / 4 = 3.1815 -> 3.182\n     Hour 7: (4.086 + 2.679 + 2.947 + 1.875) / 4 = 11.587 / 4 = 2.89675 -> 2.897\n     Hour 8: (3.416 + 3.081 + 2.344 + 2.746) / 4 = 11.587 / 4 = 2.89675 -> 2.897\n        Wait, let me recalculate: 3.416+3.081=6.497; 2.344+2.746=5.09; total 11.587 -> 11.587/4=2.89675 -> 2.897\n     Hour 9: (3.148 + 2.411 + 3.014 + 1.608) / 4 = (3.148+2.411=5.559; 3.014+1.608=4.622; total 10.181) -> 10.181/4=2.54525 -> 2.545\n     Hour 10: (3.282 + 2.344 + 3.550 + 2.277) / 4 = (3.282+2.344=5.626; 3.550+2.277=5.827; total 11.453) -> 11.453/4=2.86325 -> 2.863\n     Hour 11: (2.009 + 3.148 + 3.617 + 2.143) / 4 = (2.009+3.148=5.157; 3.617+2.143=5.76; total 10.917) -> 10.917/4=2.72925 -> 2.729\n     Hour 12: (2.143 + 2.076 + 2.277 + 1.273) / 4 = (2.143+2.076=4.219; 2.277+1.273=3.55; total 7.769) -> 7.769/4=1.94225 -> 1.942\n     Hour 13: (1.608 + 2.277 + 2.478 + 2.277) / 4 = (1.608+2.277=3.885; 2.478+2.277=4.755; total 8.64) -> 8.64/4=2.160\n     Hour 14: (2.076 + 2.210 + 2.545 + 2.679) / 4 = (2.076+2.210=4.286; 2.545+2.679=5.224; total 9.51) -> 9.51/4=2.3775 -> 2.378\n     Hour 15: (2.143 + 4.689 + 2.277 + 2.344) / 4 = (2.143+4.689=6.832; 2.277+2.344=4.621; total 11.453) -> 11.453/4=2.86325 -> 2.863\n     Hour 16: (2.277 + 1.541 + 2.210 + 2.143) / 4 = (2.277+1.541=3.818; 2.210+2.143=4.353; total 8.171) -> 8.171/4=2.04275 -> 2.043\n     Hour 17: (2.277 + 1.608 + 2.210 + 2.210) / 4 = (2.277+1.608=3.885; 2.210+2.210=4.42; total 8.305) -> 8.305/4=2.07625 -> 2.076\n     Hour 18: (2.143 + 0.938 + 1.340 + 1.741) / 4 = (2.143+0.938=3.081; 1.340+1.741=3.081; total 6.162) -> 6.162/4=1.5405 -> 1.541\n     Hour 19: (2.344 + 1.340 + 1.139 + 1.206) / 4 = (2.344+1.340=3.684; 1.139+1.206=2.345; total 6.029) -> 6.029/4=1.50725 -> 1.507\n     Hour 20: (2.612 + 1.407 + 1.139 + 1.206) / 4 = (2.612+1.407=4.019; 1.139+1.206=2.345; total 6.364) -> 6.364/4=1.591\n     Hour 21: (3.416 + 0.670 + 2.947 + 1.273) / 4 = (3.416+0.670=4.086; 2.947+1.273=4.22; total 8.306) -> 8.306/4=2.0765 -> 2.077\n     Hour 22: (3.818 + 0.804 + 2.210 + 2.009) / 4 = (3.818+0.804=4.622; 2.210+2.009=4.219; total 8.841) -> 8.841/4=2.21025 -> 2.210\n     Hour 23: (4.622 + 2.545 + 2.679 + 1.808) / 4 = (4.622+2.545=7.167; 2.679+1.808=4.487; total 11.654) -> 11.654/4=2.9135 -> 2.914\n\n 17. Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-07-17 00:00:00 -> 4.454\n            2016-07-17 01:00:00 -> 4.454\n            2016-07-17 02:00:00 -> 4.488\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 2.914\n\n     Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 18. The dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-07-17 00:00:00\n     Then 2016-07-17 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-07-20 23:00:00.\n\n 19. Format: We output the date in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, and the HULL with 3 decimal places.\n\n 20. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 21. Note: We are aware that this is a simple average method. In practice, more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning) might be used, \n     but with only 4 days of data, we opt for simplicity.\n\n 22. Let's generate the data:\n\n     We have 4 blocks of 24 hours, each block being the same 24 averages.\n\n 23. We'll write the next 96 points:\n\n     First point: 2016-07-17 00:00:00, 4.454\n     Second: 2016-07-17 01:00:00, 4.454\n     ... and so on.\n\n 24. We must be cautious: the last date in the input is 2016-07-16 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-07-17 00:00:00.\n\n 25. We output the data in the same format as the input.\n\n 26. We note that the input had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 27. We'll generate the dates programmatically in the output.\n\n 28. Since we are to output in a markdown code block, we write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ```\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00 4.454\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00 4.454\n        ... \n        ```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 29. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n     We'll create a list of the 24 average values (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 30. The 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimal places) are:\n\n        hour0: 4.454\n        hour1: 4.454\n        hour2: 4.488\n        hour3: 4.153\n        hour4: 4.052\n        hour5: 3.885\n        hour6: 3.182\n        hour7: 2.897\n        hour8: 2.897\n        hour9: 2.545\n        hour10: 2.863\n        hour11: 2.729\n        hour12: 1.942\n        hour13: 2.160\n        hour14: 2.378\n        hour15: 2.863\n        hour16: 2.043\n        hour17: 2.076\n        hour18: 1.541\n        hour19: 1.507\n        hour20: 1.591\n        hour21: 2.077\n        hour22: 2.210\n        hour23: 2.914\n\n 31. Now, we write the next 96 lines:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-07-17\n        hour0: 4.454\n        hour1: 4.454\n        ... hour23: 2.914\n\n     Day 2: 2016-07-18: same 24 numbers\n     Day 3: 2016-07-19: same\n     Day 4: 2016-07-20: same\n\n 32. We output the date string in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 33. We write the code block.\n\n 34. However, note: the input had the date as index? But in the example, it was a column. We output two columns: the date string and the value.\n\n 35. We output:\n\n        date                HULL\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00 4.454\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00 4.454\n        ...\n\n 36. We do not include the index numbers (like the input had: \"2016-07-13 00:00:00\" without an index number in front).\n\n 37. We write the output without the index, just the date string and the value.\n\n 38. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-07-17 00:00:00\n     Then add 1 hour until 96 hours.\n\n 39. We'll generate the dates:\n\n     from datetime import datetime, timedelta? But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n     We know:\n        Day1: 2016-07-17: 24 hours\n        Day2: 2016-07-18\n        Day3: 2016-07-19\n        Day4: 2016-07-20\n\n     We write:\n\n        2016-07-17 00:00:00\n        2016-07-17 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-07-17 23:00:00\n        2016-07-18 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-07-20 23:00:00\n\n 40. We have the 24 values for the first day, then repeat the same for the next days.\n\n 41. We write the output.\n\n 42. Note: We must be cautious about the rounding.
