        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-03-02 00:00:00 to 2017-03-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). Also, there might be weekly patterns but we only have 4 days, so we focus on daily.\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided sample there are none. So we assume that the provided history is complete, but we must be robust in forecasting.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data is hourly with daily seasonality, we can use a seasonal time series model.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history. We must use a model that can handle short series.\n\n We can try:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last day (24 to 48 hours ago) as forecast. But the pattern might change.\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24).\n   - SARIMA: but with only 96 points, fitting a SARIMA model might be challenging due to the short history, we might use a simpler model.\n\n But note: the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: during the day (from hour 0 to about 10) the values are around 0 to positive, then they become negative in the afternoon and evening, and then become less negative at night.\n   - However, the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that captures the seasonality and the recent trend.\n\n Since the problem states that there might be missing values in the data, but the provided history is complete, we can use a model that is robust to missing values? However, for forecasting we assume the history is complete.\n\n We'll use:\n   - ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels, with additive trend and additive seasonality of period 24.\n\n But note: the series is very short (only 4 days). We might get a warning, but we can proceed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: take the average of the last 4 days for each hour and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly repeating. For example, the values on 2017-03-05 are more extreme (more negative) in the evening than the previous days.\n\n We'll try to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day to form the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   - For hour 0: average of [2017-03-02 00:00:00, 2017-03-03 00:00:00, 2017-03-04 00:00:00, 2017-03-05 00:00:00]\n   - Similarly for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) so we can repeat the same daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n However, we see that the pattern is changing? The last day (2017-03-05) has a different pattern. We might consider using only the most recent day? But the problem says to use the past 96 points.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days are weighted more.\n\n But the problem does not specify the method. We are the expert and we choose a method that works for short series.\n\n Let's use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. This is a seasonal naive with a 4-day window.\n\n Steps:\n   Let h in [0,23]:\n        forecast for hour h of day 5 (2017-03-06) = average of hour h from day1, day2, day3, day4 (i.e., 2017-03-02, 03, 04, 05)\n        similarly for day 6, 7, 8, 9: but note we are forecasting 4 days? Actually 96 hours is 4 days? Yes, 4*24=96.\n\n But wait: we are forecasting the next 96 hours, which is 4 days. So we need 4 days of 24 hours.\n\n So we can compute:\n   For each hour of the day (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we use the average of that same hour from the 4 available days.\n\n However, note: the data starts at 2017-03-02 (which is a Thursday) and ends at 2017-03-05 (Sunday). The next 4 days would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? But we don't have weekday information.\n\n Since we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality, we ignore the day of the week.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Let's extract the hour of the day from the timestamp.\n\n   We have 4 days of data, each day has 24 hours.\n\n   We can create a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours).\n\n   Then for each hour in [0,23]:\n        value = (day1[hour] + day2[hour] + day3[hour] + day4[hour]) / 4\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days is just repeating this averaged day pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the last day, the evening values are more negative? But we are averaging, so we smooth that.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-05) as the pattern? But the problem says to use the next 96, so 4 days.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a complete data, we choose the average method.\n\n However, let me check the data:\n\n   For example, hour 0 (midnight) of the next day (2017-03-06) would be the average of:\n        2017-03-02 00:00:00: -0.462\n        2017-03-03 00:00:00:  0.071\n        2017-03-04 00:00:00: -0.178\n        2017-03-05 00:00:00:  0.178\n        average = (-0.462 + 0.071 - 0.178 + 0.178)/4 = (-0.391)/4 = -0.09775\n\n   Similarly, we do for every hour.\n\n But note: the data has negative and positive values.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a downward trend? But we are only averaging the same hour.\n\n Let's do the calculation for the entire next 96 hours.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Create a list of the 96 historical values.\n\n   Reshape into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n   Then take the mean along the rows (axis=0) to get a 24-length vector (the average day).\n\n   Then repeat this average day 4 times to get 96 forecasted values.\n\n   Then assign the dates: starting from 2017-03-06 00:00:00, then 00:15:00? But note: the data is hourly? The timestamps are hourly.\n\n   The next date in the data is 2017-03-06 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-09 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation in code:\n\n   But note: we are to output the data in the same format.\n\n   However, we are not allowed to run actual code? We have to do it manually? Or we can simulate.\n\n   Since we are an expert, we can compute the average for each hour and then repeat 4 times.\n\n   But 24 hours * 4 = 96, so we can compute the 24 averages and then duplicate them 4 times.\n\n   Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n   We'll index the data by day and hour:\n\n   Day1: 2017-03-02: [ -0.462, -0.533, 0.142, -0.178, -0.462, -0.817, -0.107, -0.213, -0.746, 0.426, 0.782, 0.462, 0.213, 0.711, 0.959, -0.036, -1.066, -1.954, -2.274, -2.381, -2.452, -2.559, -0.782, 0.000]\n   Day2: 2017-03-03: [0.071, 0.426, 0.071, 0.249, 0.071, 0.675, -0.142, -0.604, 0.000, 0.000, 0.213, 1.137, 0.604, -0.391, -0.462, -0.391, -1.137, -1.848, -2.523, -2.452, -2.345, -2.559, -2.132, -0.391]\n   Day3: 2017-03-04: [-0.178, -0.178, -0.213, -0.178, -0.391, 0.071, -0.249, 0.249, -0.391, -0.995, -1.244, -1.635, -1.777, -1.777, -0.569, -1.599, -1.421, -1.848, -2.559, -2.416, -2.523, -3.731, -2.310, -0.782]\n   Day4: 2017-03-05: [0.178, 0.036, 0.000, 0.497, -0.071, 0.746, -0.107, -0.355, -0.355, -1.102, -0.391, -0.640, 0.000, -1.315, -0.959, -1.457, -2.168, -2.025, -2.452, -2.345, -2.381, -3.411, -1.777, -1.102]\n\n   Now, for each hour (0 to 23) we compute the average:\n\n   Hour0: (-0.462 + 0.071 -0.178 + 0.178)/4 = (-0.391)/4 = -0.09775\n   Hour1: (-0.533 + 0.426 -0.178 + 0.036)/4 = (-0.249)/4 = -0.06225\n   Hour2: (0.142 + 0.071 -0.213 + 0.000)/4 = (0.000)/4 = 0.0\n   Hour3: (-0.178 + 0.249 -0.178 + 0.497)/4 = (0.39)/4 = 0.0975\n   Hour4: (-0.462 + 0.071 -0.391 -0.071)/4 = (-0.853)/4 = -0.21325\n   Hour5: (-0.817 + 0.675 + 0.071 + 0.746)/4 = (0.675)/4 = 0.16875\n   Hour6: (-0.107 -0.142 -0.249 -0.107)/4 = (-0.605)/4 = -0.15125\n   Hour7: (-0.213 -0.604 +0.249 -0.355)/4 = (-0.923)/4 = -0.23075\n   Hour8: (-0.746 + 0.000 -0.391 -0.355)/4 = (-1.492)/4 = -0.373\n   Hour9: (0.426 + 0.000 -0.995 -1.102)/4 = (-1.671)/4 = -0.41775\n   Hour10: (0.782 + 0.213 -1.244 -0.391)/4 = (-0.64)/4 = -0.16\n   Hour11: (0.462 + 1.137 -1.635 -0.640)/4 = (-0.676)/4 = -0.169\n   Hour12: (0.213 + 0.604 -1.777 + 0.000)/4 = (-0.96)/4 = -0.24\n   Hour13: (0.711 -0.391 -1.777 -1.315)/4 = (-2.772)/4 = -0.693\n   Hour14: (0.959 -0.462 -0.569 -0.959)/4 = (-1.031)/4 = -0.25775\n   Hour15: (-0.036 -0.391 -1.599 -1.457)/4 = (-3.483)/4 = -0.87075\n   Hour16: (-1.066 -1.137 -1.421 -2.168)/4 = (-5.792)/4 = -1.448\n   Hour17: (-1.954 -1.848 -1.848 -2.025)/4 = (-7.675)/4 = -1.91875\n   Hour18: (-2.274 -2.523 -2.559 -2.452)/4 = (-9.808)/4 = -2.452\n   Hour19: (-2.381 -2.452 -2.416 -2.345)/4 = (-9.594)/4 = -2.3985\n   Hour20: (-2.452 -2.345 -2.523 -2.381)/4 = (-9.701)/4 = -2.42525\n   Hour21: (-2.559 -2.559 -3.731 -3.411)/4 = (-12.26)/4 = -3.065\n   Hour22: (-0.782 -2.132 -2.310 -1.777)/4 = (-7.001)/4 = -1.75025\n   Hour23: (0.000 -0.391 -0.782 -1.102)/4 = (-2.275)/4 = -0.56875\n\n   Then the forecast for 2017-03-06 to 2017-03-09 is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-03-06): [ -0.09775, -0.06225, 0.0, 0.0975, -0.21325, 0.16875, -0.15125, -0.23075, -0.373, -0.41775, -0.16, -0.169, -0.24, -0.693, -0.25775, -0.87075, -1.448, -1.91875, -2.452, -2.3985, -2.42525, -3.065, -1.75025, -0.56875]\n        Day2 (2017-03-07): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-03-08): same as above\n        Day4 (2017-03-09): same as above\n\n   But note: the dates must be generated.\n\n   The last date in the given data is 2017-03-05 23:00:00.\n\n   The next date is 2017-03-06 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00, then 2017-03-07 00:00:00, ... until 2017-03-09 23:00:00.\n\n   We have to output 96 rows.\n\n   Format:\n\n        date, MULL\n        2017-03-06 00:00:00, -0.09775\n        2017-03-06 01:00:00, -0.06225\n        ... \n        2017-03-09 23:00:00, -0.56875\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we output all 96.\n\n   But the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\".\n\n   We'll output the 96 rows.\n\n   However, the numbers we computed are long decimals. We should round to 3 decimal places? Because the input data had 3 decimals.\n\n   Let me round each to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Hour0: -0.098\n   Hour1: -0.062\n   Hour2: 0.000\n   Hour3: 0.098\n   Hour4: -0.213\n   Hour5: 0.169\n   Hour6: -0.151\n   Hour7: -0.231\n   Hour8: -0.373\n   Hour9: -0.418\n   Hour10: -0.160\n   Hour11: -0.169\n   Hour12: -0.240\n   Hour13: -0.693\n   Hour14: -0.258\n   Hour15: -0.871\n   Hour16: -1.448\n   Hour17: -1.919\n   Hour18: -2.452\n   Hour19: -2.399\n   Hour20: -2.425\n   Hour21: -3.065\n   Hour22: -1.750\n   Hour23: -0.569\n\n   Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the given data is hourly. So we stick to hourly.\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-06 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-03-09 23:00:00\n\n   We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records ... sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes\". But the provided data is hourly. So we output hourly.\n\n   We'll output the data in the same format as the input.\n\n   Example:\n\n        2017-03-06 00:00:00 -0.098\n        2017-03-06 01:00:00 -0.062\n        ...\n\n   We must output 96 rows.\n\n   Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n   But note: the problem requires the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-03-06 00:00:00 -0.098\n        2017-03-06 01:00:00 -0.062\n        ... (96 lines)\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n   However, the input had a space and then the value? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2017-03-02 00:00:00 -0.462\"\n\n   But in the example, the value was aligned with a space. We can use a space.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        [date string] [space] [value]\n\n   And we round the value to 3 decimal places.\n\n   But note: the input had negative values with a minus sign and positive without.\n\n   We'll format the numbers to have 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: some values are integers? We'll format to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Example: 0.0 becomes 0.000? But the input had 0.000? Actually, the input had \"0.000\" only for 0? But we see:\n\n        2017-03-02 23:00:00  0.000   -> so it was written as 0.000? Actually, the input had \"0.000\" for the example? \n\n        But in the provided data: \n            2017-03-02 23:00:00  0.000 -> but in the text it is written as \"0.000\"\n\n        However, in the text above, it is written as \"0.000\" for 2017-03-02 23:00:00? Actually, in the provided data it is written as \"0.000\" but in the text above it is written as \"0.000\" with three zeros? \n\n        Actually, the input data for 2017-03-02 23:00:00 is \"0.000\", but in the text above it is written as \"0.000\" (with three zeros). \n\n        We'll output the numbers with 3 decimal places.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        We have 24 values for the average day, rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Then we repeat 4 times.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        for day in [6,7,8,9]:\n            for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n                date = f\"2017-03-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = the value for that hour (from the 24 we computed)\n\n   But note: the day in March: 06,07,08,09.\n\n   We must be cautious: March has 31 days, so 06,07,08,09 are valid.\n\n   Let's write the 96 lines.\n\n   However, we must output the exact format.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        Line1: 2017-03-06 00:00:00 -0.098\n        Line2: 2017-03-06 01:00:00 -0.062\n        ...\n        Line25: 2017-03-07 00:00:00 -0.098\n        ... and so on.\n\n   But note: the value for hour0 of each day is the same? Yes, because we are repeating the same daily pattern.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        pattern = [-0.098, -0.062, 0.000, 0.098, -0.213, 0.169, -0.151, -0.231, -0.373, -0.418, -0.160, -0.169, -0.240, -0.693, -0.258, -0.871, -1.448, -1.919, -2.452, -2.399, -2.425, -3.065, -1.750, -0.569]\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            day_offset = i // 24   # 0,1,2,3\n            hour_index = i % 24\n            day = 6 + day_offset\n            date_str = f\"2017-03-{day:02d} {hour_index:02d}:00:00\"\n            value = pattern[hour_index]\n\n   But note: the hour_index: 0 -> 00:00:00, 1 -> 01:00:00, ... 23 -> 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll write the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, we computed the pattern with 3 decimal places?

The formatting will handle that.\n\n   However, we have to be cautious: the value 0.0 becomes \"0.000\", and negative values become \"-0.098\", etc.\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines accordingly.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   We'll outputting 96 lines.\n\n   Let me write the first few:\n\n        2017-03-06 00:00:00 -0.098\n        2017-03-06 01:00:00 -0.062\n        2017-03-06 02:00:00 0.000\n        2017-03-06 03:00:00 0.098\n        2017-03-06 04:00:00 -0.213\n        2017-03-06 05:00:00 0.169\n        2017-03-06 06:00:00 -0.151\n        2017-03-06 07:00:00 -0.231\n        2017-03-06 08:00:00 -0.373\n        2017-03-06 09:00:00 -0.418\n        2017-03-06 10:00:00 -0.160\n        2017-03-06 11:00:00 -0.169\n        2017-03-06 12:00:00 -0.240\n        2017-03-06 13:00:00 -0.693\n        2017-03-06 14:00:00 -0.258\n        2017-03-06 15:00:00 -0.871\n        2017-03-06 16:00:00 -1.448\n        2017-03-06 17:00:00 -1.919\n        2017-03-06 18:00:00 -2.452\n        2017-03-06 19:00:00 -2.399\n        2017-03-06 20:00:00 -2.425\n        2017-03-06 21:00:00 -3.065\n        2017-03-06 22:00:00 -1.750\n        2017-03-06 23:00:00 -0.569\n\n        Then for 2017-03-07, same values.\n\n   We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. We are not given any missing values in the history? So we assume the history is complete.\n\n   We output the forecast.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"be aware of that\" for missing values, but we are not told to impute the history? We are only forecasting the future.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   Let's write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Important: the answer must be in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-03-06 00:00:00 -0.098\n        2017-03-06 01:00:00 -0.062\n        ...
