        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) of a transformer.\n The data spans from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values, starting from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the data may have missing values, but in the provided data we don't see any missing entries for the 96 points.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, we must provide the complete data without any omission.\n\n Approach:\n We are to use time series forecasting. Given the relatively small data (only 4 days) and the hourly frequency, we can consider:\n  - The data shows a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with 24 hours as the seasonality period.\n  - We might also consider an overall trend, but the data is short.\n\n However, note that the data has negative values and fluctuations.\n\n Given the constraints, we are to provide a forecast for the next 96 points.\n\n We can use a simple seasonal model or a more advanced one. But note: we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code.\n\n Since I cannot run code, I will have to rely on a simple method:\n\n 1. We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the overall trend (if any) for the next 4 days.\n\n However, the data is only 4 days, so we can compute the hourly average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n But note: the data does not be stationary? We see that the values on 2016-12-17 are generally higher than the others.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-19) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? \n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we assume the next 96 will be forecasted without gaps.\n\n Since we must provide the data, and we are an expert, we can use a simple average of the same hour across the four days and then project that pattern for the next four days.\n\n Steps:\n\n  Step 1: Extract the hour of the day for each record.\n  Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average HULL over the 4 days.\n\n  But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-12-16): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n    Day 2: (2016-12-17): \n    Day 3: (2016-12-18):\n    Day 4: (2016-12-19):\n\n  We can compute:\n\n    2016-12-16: \n        Sum = 2.143+2.210+1.541+0.871+0.536-0.469+0.067+0.134+1.541+0.335+0.737+0.603-0.871+0.938+0.804+1.072-0.201-0.335-0.469-0.469-0.536-0.067+0.268+1.541\n        Let me calculate:\n\n        Positive: 2.143+2.210+1.541+0.871+0.536+0.067+0.134+1.541+0.335+0.737+0.603+0.938+0.804+1.072+0.268+1.541 = \n          = 2.143+2.210=4.353; +1.541=5.894; +0.871=6.765; +0.536=7.301; +0.067=7.368; +0.134=7.502; +1.541=9.043; +0.335=9.378; +0.737=10.115; +0.603=10.718; +0.938=11.656; +0.804=12.46; +1.072=13.532; +0.268=13.8; +1.541=15.341\n\n        Negative: -0.469-0.871-0.201-0.335-0.469-0.469-0.536-0.067\n          = -0.469*4 = -1.876; -0.871 = -2.747; -0.201 = -2.948; -0.335 = -3.283; -0.536 = -3.819; -0.067 = -3.886\n\n        Total = 15.341 - 3.886 = 11.455\n        Average = 11.455 / 24 = 0.4773\n\n    2016-12-17: \n        Values: 2.679,2.679,3.885,2.679,2.880,2.344,1.541,2.210,2.009,0.804,0.938,0.871,-0.469,0.067,0.804,0.000,-0.067,-0.670,-0.536,-0.469,-0.603,-2.143,-0.134,0.268\n        Positive: 2.679+2.679+3.885+2.679+2.880+2.344+1.541+2.210+2.009+0.804+0.938+0.871+0.067+0.804+0.268 = \n          2.679*3=8.037; +3.885=11.922; +2.880=14.802; +2.344=17.146; +1.541=18.687; +2.210=20.897; +2.009=22.906; +0.804=23.71; +0.938=24.648; +0.871=25.519; +0.067=25.586; +0.804=26.39; +0.268=26.658\n        Negative: -0.469-0.067-0.670-0.536-0.469-0.603-2.143\n          = -0.469-0.067 = -0.536; -0.670 = -1.206; -0.536 = -1.742; -0.469 = -2.211; -0.603 = -2.814; -2.143 = -4.957\n        Total = 26.658 - 4.957 = 21.701\n        Average = 21.701/24 = 0.9042\n\n    2016-12-18:\n        Values: 1.674,2.076,1.942,1.340,0.469,1.072,0.067,0.000,1.072,1.541,0.469,0.402,-0.536,0.402,0.268,0.603,0.201,0.000,-0.603,-0.603,-0.804,-1.273,1.340,0.201\n        Positive: 1.674+2.076+1.942+1.340+0.469+1.072+0.067+1.072+1.541+0.469+0.402+0.402+0.268+0.603+0.201+1.340+0.201\n          = 1.674+2.076=3.75; +1.942=5.692; +1.340=7.032; +0.469=7.501; +1.072=8.573; +0.067=8.64; +1.072=9.712; +1.541=11.253; +0.469=11.722; +0.402=12.124; +0.402=12.526; +0.268=12.794; +0.603=13.397; +0.201=13.598; +1.340=14.938; +0.201=15.139\n        Negative: -0.536-0.603-0.603-0.804-1.273\n          = -0.536-0.603=-1.139; -0.603=-1.742; -0.804=-2.546; -1.273=-3.819\n        Total = 15.139 - 3.819 = 11.32\n        Average = 11.32/24 = 0.4717\n\n    2016-12-19:\n        Values: 2.411,3.081,1.808,1.942,1.942,1.808,1.674,1.139,2.210,0.737,0.000,0.201,-0.603,0.402,0.737,0.603,0.000,-0.335,-0.536,-0.670,-0.670,-1.407,-0.871,0.000\n        Positive: 2.411+3.081+1.808+1.942+1.942+1.808+1.674+1.139+2.210+0.737+0.201+0.402+0.737+0.603\n          = 2.411+3.081=5.492; +1.808=7.3; +1.942=9.242; +1.942=11.184; +1.808=12.992; +1.674=14.666; +1.139=15.805; +2.210=18.015; +0.737=18.752; +0.201=18.953; +0.402=19.355; +0.737=20.092; +0.603=20.695\n        Negative: -0.603-0.335-0.536-0.670-0.670-1.407-0.871\n          = -0.603-0.335=-0.938; -0.536=-1.474; -0.670=-2.144; -0.670=-2.814; -1.407=-4.221; -0.871=-5.092\n        Total = 20.695 - 5.092 = 15.603\n        Average = 15.603/24 = 0.6501\n\n  The daily averages: [0.4773, 0.9042, 0.4717, 0.6501] -> no clear trend, but we see a drop on the third day and then a slight increase.\n\n  However, for simplicity and because we don't have a strong trend, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to represent the typical hour.\n\n  But note: the next 4 days might be similar to the last 4 days? We don't have information about weekly seasonality (only 4 days, not a week).\n\n  Therefore, we will forecast the next 96 hours by repeating the average hourly pattern of the last 4 days? \n\n  However, that would be the same for each day? We can also consider using the last day (2016-12-19) as the base and then adjust by the overall average of the 4 days? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But we are limited data.\n\n  Given the instructions, we must provide the data. Let's choose a method:\n\n  Method: \n    We compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n    For hour 0: (2.143 + 2.679 + 1.674 + 2.411) / 4 = (2.907) \n    For hour 1: (2.210+2.679+2.076+3.081)/4 = (10.046)/4 = 2.5115\n\n    And so on.\n\n  Then we use these 24 averages and repeat them for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n  But note: the data might have a slight trend? We could adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n  However, without a clear trend and with only 4 days, we stick to the average.\n\n  Let's compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n  Hour 0: (2.143, 2.679, 1.674, 2.411) -> (2.143+2.679=4.822; +1.674=6.496; +2.411=8.907) -> 8.907/4 = 2.22675\n  Hour 1: (2.210, 2.679, 2.076, 3.081) -> 2.210+2.679=4.889; +2.076=6.965; +3.081=10.046 -> 10.046/4 = 2.5115\n  Hour 2: (1.541, 3.885, 1.942, 1.808) -> 1.541+3.885=5.426; +1.942=7.368; +1.808=9.176 -> 9.176/4 = 2.294\n  Hour 3: (0.871, 2.679, 1.340, 1.942) -> 0.871+2.679=3.55; +1.340=4.89; +1.942=6.832 -> 6.832/4 = 1.708\n  Hour 4: (0.536, 2.880, 0.469, 1.942) -> 0.536+2.880=3.416; +0.469=3.885; +1.942=5.827 -> 5.827/4 = 1.45675\n  Hour 5: (-0.469, 2.344, 1.072, 1.808) -> -0.469+2.344=1.875; +1.072=2.947; +1.808=4.755 -> 4.755/4 = 1.18875\n  Hour 6: (0.067, 1.541, 0.067, 1.674) -> 0.067+1.541=1.608; +0.067=1.675; +1.674=3.349 -> 3.349/4 = 0.83725\n  Hour 7: (0.134, 2.210, 0.000, 1.139) -> 0.134+2.210=2.344; +0.000=2.344; +1.139=3.483 -> 3.483/4 = 0.87075\n  Hour 8: (1.541, 2.009, 1.072, 2.210) -> 1.541+2.009=3.55; +1.072=4.622; +2.210=6.832 -> 6.832/4 = 1.708\n  Hour 9: (0.335, 0.804, 1.541, 0.737) -> 0.335+0.804=1.139; +1.541=2.68; +0.737=3.417 -> 3.417/4 = 0.85425\n  Hour 10: (0.737, 0.938, 0.469, 0.000) -> 0.737+0.938=1.675; +0.469=2.144; +0.000=2.144 -> 2.144/4 = 0.536\n  Hour 11: (0.603, 0.871, 0.402, 0.201) -> 0.603+0.871=1.474; +0.402=1.876; +0.201=2.077 -> 2.077/4 = 0.51925\n  Hour 12: (-0.871, -0.469, -0.536, -0.603) -> -0.871-0.469=-1.34; -0.536=-1.876; -0.603=-2.479 -> -2.479/4 = -0.61975\n  Hour 13: (0.938, 0.067, 0.402, 0.402) -> 0.938+0.067=1.005; +0.402=1.407; +0.402=1.809 -> 1.809/4 = 0.45225\n  Hour 14: (0.804, 0.804, 0.268, 0.737) -> 0.804+0.804=1.608; +0.268=1.876; +0.737=2.613 -> 2.613/4 = 0.65325\n  Hour 15: (1.072, 0.000, 0.603, 0.603) -> 1.072+0.000=1.072; +0.603=1.675; +0.603=2.278 -> 2.278/4 = 0.5695\n  Hour 16: (-0.201, -0.067, 0.201, 0.000) -> -0.201-0.067=-0.268; +0.201=-0.067; +0.000=-0.067 -> -0.067/4 = -0.01675\n  Hour 17: (-0.335, -0.670, 0.000, -0.335) -> -0.335-0.670=-1.005; +0.000=-1.005; -0.335=-1.34 -> -1.34/4 = -0.335\n  Hour 18: (-0.469, -0.536, -0.603, -0.536) -> -0.469-0.536=-1.005; -0.603=-1.608; -0.536=-2.144 -> -2.144/4 = -0.536\n  Hour 19: (-0.469, -0.469, -0.603, -0.670) -> -0.469-0.469=-0.938; -0.603=-1.541; -0.670=-2.211 -> -2.211/4 = -0.55275\n  Hour 20: (-0.536, -0.603, -0.804, -0.670) -> -0.536-0.603=-1.139; -0.804=-1.943; -0.670=-2.613 -> -2.613/4 = -0.65325\n  Hour 21: (-0.067, -2.143, -1.273, -1.407) -> -0.067-2.143=-2.21; -1.273=-3.483; -1.407=-4.89 -> -4.89/4 = -1.2225\n  Hour 22: (0.268, -0.134, 1.340, -0.871) -> 0.268-0.134=0.134; +1.340=1.474; -0.871=0.603 -> 0.603/4 = 0.15075\n  Hour 23: (1.541, 0.268, 0.201, 0.000) -> 1.541+0.268=1.809; +0.201=2.01; +0.000=2.01 -> 2.01/4 = 0.5025\n\n  So the hourly averages for 0 to 23 are:\n\n  0: 2.22675\n  1: 2.5115\n  2: 2.294\n  3: 1.708\n  4: 1.45675\n  5: 1.18875\n  6: 0.83725\n  7: 0.87075\n  8: 1.708\n  9: 0.85425\n  10: 0.536\n  11: 0.51925\n  12: -0.61975\n  13: 0.45225\n  14: 0.65325\n  15: 0.5695\n  16: -0.01675\n  17: -0.335\n  18: -0.536\n  19: -0.55275\n  20: -0.65325\n  21: -1.2225\n  22: 0.15075\n  23: 0.5025\n\n  Then we repeat this pattern for the next 4 days (from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00).\n\n  The next 96 hours:\n\n  Day 1: 2016-12-20 (Tuesday? but we don't have weekday info) - we just use the pattern.\n\n  So:\n\n  2016-12-20 00:00:00 -> hour0: 2.22675\n  2016-12-20 01:00:00 -> hour1: 2.5115\n  ... until hour23: 0.5025\n\n  Then 2016-12-21: same pattern, and so on.\n\n  We'll generate 4 days of 24 values each.\n\n  However, note: the data provided ends at 2016-12-19 23:00:00, so the next day is 2016-12-20.\n\n  We must output the data in the same structure: two columns: date and HULL.\n\n  We'll generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2016-12-20 00:00:00\n    Then 2016-12-20 01:00:00 ... until 2016-12-20 23:00:00\n    Then 2016-12-21 00:00:00 ... until 2016-12-21 23:00:00\n    Then 2016-12-22 00:00:00 ... until 2016-12-22 23:00:00\n    Then 2016-12-23 00:00:00 ... until 2016-12-23 23:00:00\n\n  And the HULL values are the 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
