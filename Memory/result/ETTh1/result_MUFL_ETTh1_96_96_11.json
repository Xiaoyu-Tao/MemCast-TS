        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load is higher during certain hours (like evening) and lower during others (like early morning).\n\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast should be robust to potential missingness.\n\n 3. We will use a time series model that can capture seasonality. Since we have hourly data and the seasonality is 24 hours, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need for 4 days forecast, we can use a simple but effective method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) as the forecast.\n    - However, we have 4 days of history, so we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? or use the last day (which is the 4th day) as the forecast for the next day.\n\n 5. But note: the data shows some variation from day to day. Let's look at the pattern:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-08-14): \n        Low at 08:00 (7.604), then rises to around 10 during the day, then drops in the evening and then rises again at night.\n\n    Day 2 (2016-08-15): \n        Similar pattern but with different values.\n\n    Day 3 (2016-08-16): \n        Noticeably lower values during the day (e.g., 5.508 at 08:00) and then a rise at night.\n\n    Day 4 (2016-08-17): \n        Again, similar pattern.\n\n 6. Since we are only given 4 days, and we are to forecast the next 4 days, we can use a model that uses the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n    Let H be the hour (0 to 23). For each hour H in the next 96 hours (which are 4 days), we compute:\n\n        forecast(H) = average of the H-th hour of the past 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the last day (2016-08-17) might be the most representative? But we don't know if there's a trend.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-08-17) as the forecast for the next day (2016-08-18), then use the same pattern for the next days? \n    But that would be a possible seasonal naive method for one season ahead.\n\n 8. Considering the limited data, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days. This will smooth out some noise and capture the daily pattern.\n\n 9. Steps for each hour in the next 96 hours (which are 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours):\n\n    Let the forecast period start at 2016-08-18 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-08-17 23:00:00).\n\n    For a given hour H (0 to 23) on day D (where D=0 for 2016-08-18, D=1 for 2016-08-19, etc.), we don't have future data to average. \n    So we will use the same hour from the past 4 days (2016-08-14, 2016-08-15, 2016-08-16, 2016-08-17) for the same hour H.\n\n    Therefore, for each hour H (0 to 23) in the forecast period, we compute:\n\n        forecast = (value at H on 2016-08-14 + value at H on 2016-08-15 + value at H on 2016-08-16 + value at H on 2016-08-17) / 4\n\n    And we use this same average for each day in the forecast period? \n\n    But note: the pattern might change from Monday to Sunday? We don't have the day of the week. The given period is from Sunday (2016-08-14) to Wednesday (2016-08-17). \n    The next 4 days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. \n\n    However, we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only one week? and we have 4 days). So we ignore weekly seasonality and use the daily pattern.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last 4 same hours. But note that the next 4 (Sunday) might be similar to the previous Sunday? But we only have one Sunday.\n\n 11. Given the constraints, I will use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each hour in the forecast period.\n\n 12. However, if we do that, then the forecast for all 4 days will be the same pattern? That is, the same 24 values repeated 4 times? \n\n     But that might be acceptable because we don't see a clear trend in the 4 days? \n\n     Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = (13.539+14.925+...+11.122)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n            We see values from 7.6 to 14.9 -> average around 10-11?\n        Day2: similar\n        Day3: lower (min 5.5, max 13.36) -> average might be lower?\n        Day4: similar to day1?\n\n     Actually, we can compute the daily average:\n\n        Day1 (2016-08-14): \n            sum = 13.539+14.925+13.326+12.046+11.655+10.696+10.163+10.092+7.604+8.066+9.168+9.701+10.021+10.447+10.305+9.737+9.275+8.848+8.244+8.990+12.153+11.727+11.513+11.122\n            = 244.006 / 24 = 10.1669\n\n        Day2 (2016-08-15): \n            = 12.402+11.194+10.270+9.914+8.386+9.559+9.594+8.955+7.924+8.528+9.204+9.452+9.843+11.158+11.229+10.056+9.666+9.168+8.244+9.204+12.437+12.473+14.321+14.214\n            = 238.336 / 24 = 9.9307\n\n        Day3 (2016-08-16): \n            = 14.463+13.361+13.255+12.046+12.579+11.158+8.173+7.604+5.508+6.538+7.391+7.640+8.031+8.422+8.209+7.533+7.391+6.752+6.467+7.000+9.452+11.869+12.579+13.361\n            = 220.210 / 24 = 9.1754\n\n        Day4 (2016-08-17): \n            = 13.752+13.361+13.326+11.158+11.336+9.026+9.061+8.386+7.214+8.244+9.808+9.914+9.772+11.194+10.554+10.021+8.884+8.884+8.244+8.777+11.620+11.300+11.762+12.722\n            = 229.680 / 24 = 9.5700\n\n     The daily average is decreasing then increasing? But we don't have a clear trend. \n\n 13. Therefore, using the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for the next 4 days might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 14. How to compute:\n\n     For hour 0 (00:00:00 of each day):\n        past: 2016-08-14: 13.539, 2016-08-15: 12.402, 2016-08-16: 14.463, 2016-08-17: 13.752\n        average = (13.539 + 12.402 + 14.463 + 13.752) / 4 = 13.539\n\n     Similarly for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        past: 14.925, 11.194, 13.361, 13.361 -> (14.925+11.194+13.361+13.361)/4 = 13.21025\n\n     And so on.\n\n 15. Then the forecast for:\n        2016-08-18 00:00:00: 13.539\n        2016-08-18 01:00:00: 13.21025\n        ... \n        and the same 24 values will be repeated for 2016-08-19, 2016-08-20, 2016-08-21? \n\n     But note: the problem says \"forecast the next 96 recorded dates\", which are 96 hours (4 days). So we have 4 days of 24-hour pattern.\n\n     However, if we use the same 24 numbers for each day, then the forecast for the next 4 days will be the same daily pattern.\n\n 16. But is that reasonable? The data shows that the daily average has been changing. We don't have a clear trend, so we assume that the next 4 days will have the same daily pattern as the average of the last 4 days.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we could use a model that accounts for a possible trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to fit a trend and seasonality. \n\n 18. Given the above, I will proceed with the average method.\n\n 19. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values. But the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't need to impute for the history. For the forecast, we are generating all 96 points.\n\n 20. Let's compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (13.539 + 12.402 + 14.463 + 13.752) / 4 = 13.539\n        hour1: (14.925 + 11.194 + 13.361 + 13.361) / 4 = (14.925+11.194=26.119; 13.361*2=26.722; total=52.841) /4 = 13.21025\n        hour2: (13.326+10.270+13.255+13.326)/4 = (13.326*2=26.652; 10.270+13.255=23.525; total=50.177) /4 = 12.54425\n        hour3: (12.046+9.914+12.046+11.158)/4 = (12.046*2=24.092; 9.914+11.158=21.072; total=45.164) /4 = 11.291\n        hour4: (11.655+8.386+12.579+11.336)/4 = (11.655+8.386=20.041; 12.579+11.336=23.915; total=43.956) /4 = 10.989\n        hour5: (10.696+9.559+11.158+9.026)/4 = (10.696+9.559=20.255; 11.158+9.026=20.184; total=40.439) /4 = 10.10975\n        hour6: (10.163+9.594+8.173+9.061)/4 = (10.163+9.594=19.757; 8.173+9.061=17.234; total=36.991) /4 = 9.24775\n        hour7: (10.092+8.955+7.604+8.386)/4 = (10.092+8.955=19.047; 7.604+8.386=15.99; total=35.037) /4 = 8.75925\n        hour8: (7.604+7.924+5.508+7.214)/4 = (7.604+7.924=15.528; 5.508+7.214=12.722; total=28.25) /4 = 7.0625\n        hour9: (8.066+8.528+6.538+8.244)/4 = (8.066+8.528=16.594; 6.538+8.244=14.782; total=31.376) /4 = 7.844\n        hour10: (9.168+9.204+7.391+9.808)/4 = (9.168+9.204=18.372; 7.391+9.808=17.199; total=35.571) /4 = 8.89275\n        hour11: (9.701+9.452+7.640+9.914)/4 = (9.701+9.452=19.153; 7.640+9.914=17.554; total=36.707) /4 = 9.17675\n        hour12: (10.021+9.843+8.031+9.772)/4 = (10.021+9.843=19.864; 8.031+9.772=17.803; total=37.667) /4 = 9.41675\n        hour13: (10.447+11.158+8.422+11.194)/4 = (10.447+11.158=21.605; 8.422+11.194=19.616; total=41.221) /4 = 10.30525\n        hour14: (10.305+11.229+8.209+10.554)/4 = (10.305+11.229=21.534; 8.209+10.554=18.763; total=40.297) /4 = 10.07425\n        hour15: (9.737+10.056+7.533+10.021)/4 = (9.737+10.056=19.793; 7.533+10.021=17.554; total=37.347) /4 = 9.33675\n        hour16: (9.275+9.666+7.391+8.884)/4 = (9.275+9.666=18.941; 7.391+8.884=16.275; total=35.216) /4 = 8.804\n        hour17: (8.848+9.168+6.752+8.884)/4 = (8.848+9.168=18.016; 6.752+8.884=15.636; total=33.652) /4 = 8.413\n        hour18: (8.244+8.244+6.467+8.244)/4 = (8.244*3=24.732; 6.467; total=31.199) /4 = 7.79975\n        hour19: (8.990+9.204+7.000+8.777)/4 = (8.990+9.204=18.194; 7.000+8.777=15.777; total=33.971) /4 = 8.49275\n        hour20: (12.153+12.437+9.452+11.620)/4 = (12.153+12.437=24.59; 9.452+11.620=21.072; total=45.662) /4 = 11.4155\n        hour21: (11.727+12.473+11.869+11.300)/4 = (11.727+12.473=24.2; 11.869+11.300=23.169; total=47.369) /4 = 11.84225\n        hour22: (11.513+14.321+12.579+11.762)/4 = (11.513+14.321=25.834; 12.579+11.762=24.341; total=50.175) /4 = 12.54375\n        hour23: (11.122+14.214+13.361+12.722)/4 = (11.122+14.214=25.336; 13.361+12.722=26.083; total=51.419) /4 = 12.85475\n\n 21.

We'll output 3 decimals: 7.062)\n\n        hour9: 8.066+8.528+6.538+8.244 -> 8.066+8.528=16.594; 6.538+8.244=14.782; total=31.376 -> 31.376/4=7.844\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 26. We'll generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n 27. The dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-18 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-08-18 01:00:00 ... up to 2016-08-21 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We write the data in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 30. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 31. We'll output in the required format.\n\n 32. Let's code the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals) as a list:\n\n        [13.539, 13.210, 12.544, 11.291, 10.989, 10.110, 9.248, 8.759, 7.062, 7.844, 8.893, 9.177, 9.417, 10.305, 10.074, 9.337, 8.804, 8.413, 7.800, 8.493, 11.416, 11.842, 12.544, 12.855]\n\n        But note: we computed hour22 as 12.54375 -> rounded to 12.544, and hour2 as 12.544 as well? That's okay.\n\n 33. Now, we'll generate:\n\n        for day in 0 to 3:\n            for hour in 0 to 23:\n                date = start_date + day*24 + hour\n\n        start_date = \"2016-08-18\"\n\n        The first forecast point: 2016-08-18 00:00:00 -> index0: 13.539\n\n 34. We'll write the dates accordingly.\n\n 35. Let's do it.\n\n 36. We note: the last given date is 2016-08-17 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-08-18 00:00:00.\n\n 37. We'll generate:\n\n        2016-08-18 00:00:00 13.539\n        2016-08-18 01:00:00 13.210\n        ... until\n        2016-08-18 23:00:00 12.855\n\n        then \n        2016-08-19 00:00:00 13.539\n        ... and so on.\n\n 38. We output 96 lines.\n\n 39. We write the answer in the format.\n\n 40. Let me write the first 24 hours (first day) and then the next days similarly.\n\n 41. We'll use the list of 24 values and repeat it 4 times.\n\n 42. The list of 24 values (with rounding to 3 decimals) is:\n\n        [13.539, 13.210, 12.544, 11.291, 10.989, 10.110, 9.248, 8.759, 7.062, 7.844, 8.893, 9.177, 9.417, 10.305, 10.074, 9.337, 8.804, 8.413, 7.800, 8.493, 11.416, 11.842, 12.544, 12.855]\n\n 43. But note: in the original data, the hour22 was 12.54375 -> rounded to 12.544, and hour23 was 12.85475 -> 12.855.\n\n 44. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta? But we don't need to code, we can do:\n\n        Day0: 2016-08-18\n        Day1: 2016-08-19\n        Day2: 2016-08-20\n        Day3: 2016-08-21\n\n 45. We write:\n\n        for day_offset in range(0,4):\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = \"2016-08-\" + str(18+day_offset).zfill(2) + \" \" + str(hour).zfill(2) + \":00:00\"\n                value = pattern[hour]\n\n 46. But note: August has 31 days, so 18,19,20,21 are all valid.\n\n 47. We output the data.\n\n 48. We must be cautious: the original data had the hour as two-digit with leading zeros.\n\n 49. We'll generate the dates as:\n\n        Day0: 2016-08-18\n        Day1: 2016-08-19\n        Day2: 2016-08-20\n        Day3: 2016-08-21\n\n        and for hours: 00,01,...,23.\n\n 50. Now, we write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 51. We note: the problem says \"Please obey the format strictly. And you must give me the complete answer.\"\n\n 52. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-18 00:00:00 13.539\n2016-08-18 01:00:00 13.210\n2016-08-18 02:00:00 12.544\n2016-08-18 03:00:00 11.291\n2016-08-18 04:00:00 10.989\n2016-08-18 05:00:00 10.110\n2016-08-18 06:00:00 9.248\n2016-08-18 07:00:00 8.759\n2016-08-18 08:00:00 7.062\n2016-08-18 09:00:00 7.844\n2016-08-18 10:00:00 8.893\n2016-08-18 11:00:00 9.177\n2016-08-18 12:00:00 9.417\n2016-08-18 13:00:00 10.305\n2016-08-18 14:00:00 10.074\n2016-08-18 15:00:00 9.337\n2016-08-18 16:00:00 8.804\n2016-08-18 17:00:00 8.413\n2016-08-18 18:00:00 7.800\n2016-08-18 19:00:00 8.493\n2016-08-18 20:00:00 11.416\n2016-08-18 21:00:00 11.842\n2016-08-18 22:00:00 12.544\n2016-08-18 23:00:00 12.855\n2016-08-19 00:00:00 13.539\n2016-08-19 01:00:00 13.210\n...
