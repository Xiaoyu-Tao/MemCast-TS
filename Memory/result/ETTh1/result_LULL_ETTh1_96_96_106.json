        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series with hourly frequency.\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data? But in the given 96 points, we see no missing values? However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete? \n    Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", we should check for missing values in the provided data and handle them if any. But in the given data, we have 96 consecutive hours without gaps? \n    However, we are to forecast the next 96, and we must provide complete data for the next 96.\n\n 3. We must choose a forecasting method. Given the data, we can observe:\n    - The data seems to have daily patterns (24-hour cycles). For example, on 2017-08-29, the load starts at 1.401, then goes through a cycle.\n    - There is also a notable drop in the pattern on 2017-08-31, where the load is constant at 0.914 for the entire day? That might be an anomaly or a holiday? \n    - Then on 2017-09-01, the pattern returns to a more variable state.\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the presence of potential anomalies, we need a robust method.\n\n 5. We can use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) if we can identify seasonality (which is daily, so seasonality period=24).\n    - Alternatively, an ARIMA model with seasonal component (SARIMA) might be complex for 96 points but can be tried.\n    - Given the potential anomaly on 2017-08-31, we might consider an approach that is robust to such anomalies.\n\n 6. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete? \n    But for forecasting, we must be cautious because the future might have missing? But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must output 96 consecutive points without missing.\n\n 7. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days) and we have daily seasonality, we can use a seasonal method.\n\n 8. We'll use a simple approach: \n    - We can use the last day (2017-09-01) as a base and adjust with the overall trend? \n    - But the day 2017-09-01 is a Friday? (We don't have the day of week, but 2017-08-29 is Tuesday, so 2017-09-01 is Friday, then the next 4 days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday).\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a moving average method with seasonality. But the constant day (2017-08-31) might be an issue.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast, we can use:\n     - A seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component with a simple method.\n\n 11. However, note that the data is very short. We have only 4 days. So we can try to use the average of the same hour in the previous days, but excluding the anomalous day (2017-08-31).\n\n 12. Approach:\n     - We have 4 days: Day1 (2017-08-29, Tuesday), Day2 (2017-08-30, Wednesday), Day3 (2017-08-31, Thursday) [anomalous?], Day4 (2017-09-01, Friday).\n     - We want to forecast Day5 (2017-09-02, Saturday), Day6 (Sunday), Day7 (Monday), Day8 (Tuesday).\n\n 13. Since we don't have historical data for Saturday and Sunday, we cannot use the same hour from previous weeks. So we have to rely on the last 4 days and assume the pattern continues? \n     But the pattern on Thursday (2017-08-31) is constant and might be an anomaly. So we might ignore it for the pattern.\n\n 14. Proposed method:\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the non-anomalous days (Day1, Day2, Day4). We skip Day3 because it is constant and likely an anomaly.\n     - Then we use that as the forecast for each hour in the next days? But we have to account for the fact that the next days are weekend and then Monday? \n     - However, we don't have weekend data. So we have to assume that the pattern of the weekdays is similar? Or we can use the average of the available days for each hour.\n\n 15. But note: the problem does not specify the day of the week effect. We only have 4 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (anomalous), Friday. Then we are forecasting Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.\n\n 16. Without more context, we can do:\n     - For Saturday and Sunday, we don't have comparable days. So we might use the average of the available days (Tue, Wed, Fri) for each hour? \n     - Then for Monday, we also don't have Monday data?\n     - Then for Tuesday, we have one Tuesday (2017-08-29) so we can use that? But that would be too variable.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the average of the 3 non-anomalous days for each hour to represent a \"typical day\", and use that for all the forecasted days? \n     But that ignores the day of week effect. However, we don't have enough data to model day of week.\n\n 18. Given the constraints, we will:\n     - Compute the hourly average for the 1st, 2nd, and 4th day (skipping the 3rd day which is constant).\n     - Then use that average pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps for the average:\n     - For hour 0: (1.401 + 0.944 + 0.761) / 3 = (1.401+0.944+0.761)=3.106/3=1.0353\n     - For hour 1: (1.432 + 0.944 + 0.822) / 3 = (1.432+0.944+0.822)=3.198/3=1.066\n     - ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n 20. But note: the provided data has 96 points (4 days). We are going to skip the 3rd day (2017-08-31) because it is constant and likely an anomaly.\n\n 21. Let's break the data into days:\n\n     Day1 (2017-08-29): 24 points: [1.401, 1.432, 1.249, 1.066, 1.005, 1.127, 1.157, 1.279, 1.401, 1.310, 1.371, 1.279, 1.279, 1.157, 1.279, 1.310, 0.944, 1.340, 0.975, 0.944, 1.066, 0.975, 1.127, 0.975]\n     Day2 (2017-08-30): [0.944, 0.944, 0.822, 0.914, 0.944, 0.975, 1.036, 0.975, 1.462, 1.188, 0.944, 1.066, 0.944, 0.853, 1.218, 0.670, 0.761, 0.914, 0.761, 0.761, 1.005, 1.036, 0.883, 0.944]\n     Day3 (2017-08-31): [0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914, 0.914] -> skip\n     Day4 (2017-09-01): [0.761, 0.822, 0.701, 0.731, 0.822, 1.005, 0.853, 0.761, 0.914, 0.761, 0.792, 0.761, 0.731, 0.792, 0.822, 0.853, 0.853, 0.822, 1.005, 0.883, 0.975, 0.975, 0.975, 1.066]\n\n 22. Now, for each hour (0 to 23) we average the values from Day1, Day2, and Day4.\n\n     hour0: (1.401 + 0.944 + 0.761) / 3 = 3.106/3 = 1.035333\n     hour1: (1.432 + 0.944 + 0.822) / 3 = 3.198/3 = 1.066\n     hour2: (1.249 + 0.822 + 0.701) / 3 = 2.772/3 = 0.924\n     hour3: (1.066 + 0.914 + 0.731) / 3 = 2.711/3 = 0.903667\n     hour4: (1.005 + 0.944 + 0.822) / 3 = 2.771/3 = 0.923667\n     hour5: (1.127 + 0.975 + 1.005) / 3 = 3.107/3 = 1.035667\n     hour6: (1.157 + 1.036 + 0.853) / 3 = 3.046/3 = 1.015333\n     hour7: (1.279 + 0.975 + 0.761) / 3 = 3.015/3 = 1.005\n     hour8: (1.401 + 1.462 + 0.914) / 3 = 3.777/3 = 1.259\n     hour9: (1.310 + 1.188 + 0.761) / 3 = 3.259/3 = 1.086333\n     hour10: (1.371 + 0.944 + 0.792) / 3 = 3.107/3 = 1.035667\n     hour11: (1.279 + 1.066 + 0.761) / 3 = 3.106/3 = 1.035333\n     hour12: (1.279 + 0.944 + 0.731) / 3 = 2.954/3 = 0.984667\n     hour13: (1.157 + 0.853 + 0.792) / 3 = 2.802/3 = 0.934\n     hour14: (1.279 + 1.218 + 0.822) / 3 = 3.319/3 = 1.106333\n     hour15: (1.310 + 0.670 + 0.853) / 3 = 2.833/3 = 0.944333\n     hour16: (0.944 + 0.761 + 0.853) / 3 = 2.558/3 = 0.852667\n     hour17: (1.340 + 0.914 + 0.822) / 3 = 3.076/3 = 1.025333\n     hour18: (0.975 + 0.761 + 1.005) / 3 = 2.741/3 = 0.913667\n     hour19: (0.944 + 0.761 + 0.883) / 3 = 2.588/3 = 0.862667\n     hour20: (1.066 + 1.005 + 0.975) / 3 = 3.046/3 = 1.015333\n     hour21: (0.975 + 1.036 + 0.975) / 3 = 2.986/3 = 0.995333\n     hour22: (1.127 + 0.883 + 0.975) / 3 = 2.985/3 = 0.995\n     hour23: (0.975 + 0.944 + 1.066) / 3 = 2.985/3 = 0.995\n\n 23. Now, we have a typical day pattern: 24 values (from hour0 to hour23) as above.\n\n 24. We will use this pattern for each of the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 25. The next 96 hours start at 2017-09-02 00:00:00 and end at 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n\n 26. We must output the data in the same format: two columns \"date\" and \"LULL\", with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 27. We generate the dates:\n     - Start: 2017-09-02 00:00:00\n     - Then 2017-09-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n\n 28. The LULL values for each day will be the 24 values we computed (repeated for 4 days).\n\n 29. However, note that the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are to provide the complete data. So we are generating without missing.\n\n 30. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 31. Let's round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 32. The computed typical day (averages) rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n     hour0: 1.035\n     hour1: 1.066\n     hour2: 0.924\n     hour3: 0.904\n     hour4: 0.924\n     hour5: 1.036\n     hour6: 1.015\n     hour7: 1.005\n     hour8: 1.259\n     hour9: 1.086\n     hour10: 1.036\n     hour11: 1.035\n     hour12: 0.985\n     hour13: 0.934\n     hour14: 1.106\n     hour15: 0.944\n     hour16: 0.853\n     hour17: 1.025\n     hour18: 0.914\n     hour19: 0.863\n     hour20: 1.015\n     hour21: 0.995\n     hour22: 0.995\n     hour23: 0.995\n\n 33. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n     Day1: 2017-09-02: [1.035, 0.995] (24 values as above)\n     Day2: 2017-09-03: same 24 values\n     Day3: 2017-09-04: same 24 values\n     Day4: 2017-09-05: same 24 values\n\n 34. But note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the provided data is hourly. So we are generating hourly.\n\n 35. We are to output 96 lines.\n\n 36. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-02 00:00:00 1.035\n2017-09-02 01:00:00 1.066\n... \n2017-09-05 23:00:00 0.995\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 37. However, note that the last provided data point is 2017-09-01 23:00:00. The next should be 2017-09-02 00:00:00.\n\n 38. We generate the dates:\n\n     from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n     start = datetime(2017,9,2,0,0,0)\n     then add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n 39. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 40. But note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output all 96.\n\n 41. We'll output the data as above.\n\n 42. However, note that the method is very simple. But given the data and the constraints (only 4 days, one of which is anomalous) it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 43. If we had more data, we could use a more sophisticated model. But with 4 days, we do the best we can.\n\n 44. Let's code the output.\n\n 45. We have the typical day pattern in a list:\n\n     pattern = [\n         1.035, 1.066, 0.924, 0.904, 0.924, 1.036, 1.015, 1.005,\n         1.259, 1.086, 1.036, 1.035, 0.985, 0.934, 1.106, 0.944,\n         0.853, 1.025, 0.914, 0.863, 1.015, 0.995, 0.995, 0.995\n     ]\n\n 46. Then for the next 4 days, we repeat this pattern 4 times.\n\n 47. The dates:\n\n     day0: 2017-09-02\n     day1: 2017-09-03\n     day2: 2017-09-04\n     day3: 2017-09-05\n\n 48. We generate:\n\n     for day in range(4):\n         for hour in range(24):\n             date = (start + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n             value = pattern[hour]\n\n 49. But note: we are adding days and then hours? Actually, we can do:\n\n     base_date = datetime(2017,9,2,0,0,0)\n     for i in range(96):\n         current_date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n         value = pattern[i % 24]\n\n 50. We output the string.\n\n 51. We write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 52. Let's do it.\n",
