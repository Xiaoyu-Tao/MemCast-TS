        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00 for the variable \"HULL\".\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values. \n    However, the provided data for the past 96 points is complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we will generate 96 future points.\n\n 3. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same format.\n\n 4. Since the problem does not specify a particular method, we choose an appropriate time series forecasting method. Given the data shows some patterns (like daily seasonality) and the fact that we have only 96 points (4 days) of history, we can consider:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) followed by forecasting the components.\n    - However, the data has a very short history and a clear daily pattern (24 hours). We can use a seasonal model with period=24.\n\n 5. We note that the last part of the data (2017-08-31) is constant (-2.478 for the entire day). Then on 2017-09-01, the data becomes variable again. This might indicate an anomaly or a special event. We must be cautious.\n\n 6. Given the short history and the presence of seasonality, we can use a seasonal naive method or a more sophisticated method like SARIMA. However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA model might be challenging.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving window method or even the last available day (2017-09-01) as a pattern for the next days? But note that 2017-09-01 is a Friday and the next 4 days would be Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? We don't have information about the day of the week.\n\n 8. Considering the constraints, we must produce a forecast. We can use:\n    - A seasonal naive model: forecast each hour by the value of the same hour in the previous day (or the same hour in the last available day). But note that the last day (2017-09-01) is the only day that is not constant in the last two days? Actually, 2017-08-31 is constant and 2017-09-01 is variable.\n\n 9. However, the problem says \"High UseLess Load\", which might be a transformed variable. The values are negative and positive.\n\n 10. We decide to use a simple method: \n     - Since the data of 2017-08-31 is constant and then 2017-09-01 is variable, we assume that the constant day was an anomaly? Or we can use the average of the last two non-constant days? But we only have two non-constant days: 2017-08-29, 2017-08-30, and then 2017-09-01 (2017-08-31 is constant).\n\n 11. We can also consider using the average of the same hour for the available non-constant days (2017-08-29, 2017-08-30, and 2017-09-01) for the forecast. But note that 2017-08-31 is constant and might be an outlier.\n\n 12. Approach:\n     - We will remove the constant day (2017-08-31) because it might be an anomaly (or missing data that was filled with a constant?).\n     - Then we have 3 days: 2017-08-29, 2017-08-30, 2017-09-01 (which is 72 points). But we need 96 points? Actually, 3 days * 24 = 72. We are missing 24 points? Actually, the given data is 96 points: 4 days. So we have 4 days: 2017-08-29, 2017-08-30, 2017-08-31, 2017-09-01.\n\n 13. We decide to use the last day (2017-09-01) as the pattern for the next days? But that might not capture the weekly pattern. However, we don't have weekly data.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the short history, we will use a seasonal naive method with seasonality of 24 hours, using the last day (2017-09-01) as the base for the next 4 days? But we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). So we can repeat the pattern of 2017-09-01 for the next 4 days? \n\n    However, note that 2017-09-01 is a Friday? We don't know the day of the week. The next day (2017-09-02) would be Saturday, then Sunday, etc. But without more history, we cannot model weekly seasonality.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the average of the three non-constant days (2017-08-29, 2017-08-30, 2017-09-01) for each hour to form a daily profile, and then repeat that profile for the next 4 days? But note that 2017-08-31 is constant and we are excluding it.\n\n    Steps for this method:\n        a. Extract the three days: 2017-08-29, 2017-08-30, 2017-09-01 (each has 24 hours).\n        b. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour across these three days.\n        c. Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this averaged daily profile 4 times.\n\n 16. But note: the last day (2017-09-01) might be more representative? We don't know. Also, the problem says \"High UseLess Load\", which might be a transformed variable and we don't have context.\n\n 17. We must make a decision: we choose to use the average of the three non-constant days for each hour to form a daily profile and then repeat it 4 days.\n\n    Why not use the constant day? Because it is clearly an anomaly (constant for 24 hours is unusual for this kind of data). So we exclude 2017-08-31.\n\n 18. How to compute:\n     - We have:\n          Day1: 2017-08-29: indices 0 to 23\n          Day2: 2017-08-30: indices 24 to 47\n          Day3: 2017-09-01: indices 72 to 95   [because 2017-08-31 is 48 to 71]\n\n     - We can create a matrix of 3 rows (each day) and 24 columns (each hour).\n\n     - Then for hour 0: average of [index0: 7.435, index24: -2.210, index72: 0.938] -> (7.435 -2.210 + 0.938)/3 = (6.163)/3 = 2.054333\n        hour 1: [1.340, -1.674, 1.608] -> (1.340 -1.674 + 1.608)/3 = (1.274)/3 = 0.4246667\n\n     - And so on.\n\n 19. Then we repeat this 24-hour profile 4 times to cover 96 hours.\n\n 20. However, note that the data has a trend? The values on 2017-09-01 are generally higher than the previous days? But we are averaging and then repeating, so we are not capturing any trend. \n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-01) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n 22. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days of history, we go with the average daily profile.\n\n 23. Steps in code (we are not coding but simulating the output):\n\n     - First, extract the three days:\n\n        Day0 (2017-08-29): [7.435, 1.340, 0.134, 1.273, 0.469, -0.201, 0.067, 0.670, 0.670, 0.067, 0.067, -0.067, -0.804, -0.536, 0.000, -0.737, -1.474, -1.072, -2.880, -2.210, -1.741, -1.875, -0.603, -1.942]\n        Day1 (2017-08-30): [-2.210, -1.674, -1.608, -2.947, -1.139, -2.344, -2.880, -2.076, -2.277, -4.086, -3.885, -3.483, -4.086, -3.885, -3.148, -3.014, -4.153, -4.086, -4.756, -4.756, -4.421, -4.555, -4.555, -3.014]\n        Day2 (2017-09-01): [0.938, 1.608, 1.674, 0.201, 1.072, 1.273, 0.268, 0.938, -0.067, -0.067, 0.603, -2.277, -1.808, -1.474, -1.005, 1.340, -0.670, -1.139, -1.407, -1.340, -1.407, -2.210, -1.273, -0.067]\n\n     - Now, for each hour (0 to 23) we compute the average.\n\n        hour0: (7.435 + (-2.210) + 0.938) / 3 = (6.163) / 3 = 2.054333\n        hour1: (1.340 + (-1.674) + 1.608) / 3 = (1.274) / 3 = 0.424667\n        hour2: (0.134 + (-1.608) + 1.674) / 3 = (0.2) / 3 = 0.066667\n        hour3: (1.273 + (-2.947) + 0.201) / 3 = (-1.473) / 3 = -0.491\n        hour4: (0.469 + (-1.139) + 1.072) / 3 = (0.402) / 3 = 0.134\n        hour5: (-0.201 + (-2.344) + 1.273) / 3 = (-1.272) / 3 = -0.424\n        hour6: (0.067 + (-2.880) + 0.268) / 3 = (-2.545) / 3 = -0.848333\n        hour7: (0.670 + (-2.076) + 0.938) / 3 = (-0.468) / 3 = -0.156\n        hour8: (0.670 + (-2.277) + (-0.067)) / 3 = (-1.674) / 3 = -0.558\n        hour9: (0.067 + (-4.086) + (-0.067)) / 3 = (-4.086) / 3 = -1.362\n        hour10: (0.067 + (-3.885) + 0.603) / 3 = (-3.215) / 3 = -1.071667\n        hour11: (-0.067 + (-3.483) + (-2.277) / 3 = (-5.827) / 3 = -1.942333\n        hour12: (-0.804 + (-4.086) + (-1.808)) / 3 = (-6.698) / 3 = -2.232667\n        hour13: (-0.536 + (-3.885) + (-1.474)) / 3 = (-5.895) / 3 = -1.965\n        hour14: (0.000 + (-3.148) + (-1.005)) / 3 = (-4.153) / 3 = -1.384333\n        hour15: (-0.737 + (-3.014) + 1.340) / 3 = (-2.411) / 3 = -0.803667\n        hour16: (-1.474 + (-4.153) + (-0.670)) / 3 = (-6.297) / 3 = -2.099\n        hour17: (-1.072 + (-4.086) + (-1.139)) / 3 = (-6.297) / 3 = -2.099\n        hour18: (-2.880 + (-4.756) + (-1.407)) / 3 = (-9.043) / 3 = -3.014333\n        hour19: (-2.210 + (-4.756) + (-1.340)) / 3 = (-8.306) / 3 = -2.768667\n        hour20: (-1.741 + (-4.421) + (-1.407)) / 3 = (-7.569) / 3 = -2.523\n        hour21: (-1.875 + (-4.555) + (-2.210)) / 3 = (-8.64) / 3 = -2.88\n        hour22: (-0.603 + (-4.555) + (-1.273)) / 3 = (-6.431) / 3 = -2.143667\n        hour23: (-1.942 + (-3.014) + (-0.067)) / 3 = (-5.023) / 3 = -1.674333\n\n     - Now, we have a daily profile of 24 hours: [2.054333, 0.424667, 0.066667, -0.491, 0.134, -0.424, -0.848333, -0.156, -0.558, -1.362, -1.071667, -1.942333, -2.232667, -1.965, -1.384333, -0.803667, -2.099, -2.099, -3.014333, -2.768667, -2.523, -2.88, -2.143667, -1.674333]\n\n     - Then we repeat this profile 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n 24. The forecast dates start from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 and go hourly until 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We output the data in the same format: two columns \"date\" and \"HULL\", with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 26. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided history there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 27. We write the forecast:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2017-09-02 00:00:00  2.054333\n        2017-09-02 01:00:00  0.424667\n        2017-09-02 02:00:00  0.066667\n        2017-09-02 03:00:00 -0.491\n        2017-09-02 04:00:00  0.134\n        2017-09-02 05:00:00 -0.424\n        2017-09-02 06:00:00 -0.848333\n        2017-09-02 07:00:00 -0.156\n        2017-09-02 08:00:00 -0.558\n        2017-09-02 09:00:00 -1.362\n        2017-09-02 10:00:00 -1.071667\n        2017-09-02 11:00:00 -1.942333\n        2017-09-02 12:00:00 -2.232667\n        2017-09-02 13:00:00 -1.965\n        2017-09-02 14:00:00 -1.384333\n        2017-09-02 15:00:00 -0.803667\n        2017-09-02 16:00:00 -2.099\n        2017-09-02 17:00:00 -2.099\n        2017-09-02 18:00:00 -3.014333\n        2017-09-02 19:00:00 -2.768667\n        2017-09-02 20:00:00 -2.523\n        2017-09-02 21:00:00 -2.88\n        2017-09-02 22:00:00 -2.143667\n        2017-09-02 23:00:00 -1.674333\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 28. We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 29. But note: the input data has up to 3 decimal places. So we round our averages to 3 decimals.\n\n    Let's recalculate and round:\n\n        hour0: (7.435 -2.210 + 0.938) = 6.163 -> 6.163/3 = 2.054333 -> 2.054\n        hour1: (1.340 -1.674 + 1.608) = 1.274 -> 1.274/3 = 0.424666... -> 0.425\n        hour2: (0.134 -1.608 + 1.674) = 0.2 -> 0.2/3 = 0.066666... -> 0.067\n        hour3: (1.273 -2.947 + 0.201) = -1.473 -> -1.473/3 = -0.491 -> -0.491\n        hour4: (0.469 -1.139 + 1.072) = 0.402 -> 0.402/3 = 0.134 -> 0.134\n        hour5: (-0.201 -2.344 + 1.273) = -1.272 -> -1.272/3 = -0.424 -> -0.424\n        hour6: (0.067 -2.880 + 0.268) = -2.545 -> -2.545/3 = -0.848333 -> -0.848\n        hour7: (0.670 -2.076 + 0.938) = -0.468 -> -0.468/3 = -0.156 -> -0.156\n        hour8: (0.670 -2.277 -0.067) = -1.674 -> -1.674/3 = -0.558 -> -0.558\n        hour9: (0.067 -4.086 -0.067) = -4.086 -> -4.086/3 = -1.362 -> -1.362\n        hour10: (0.067 -3.885 + 0.603) = -3.215 -> -3.215/3 = -1.071667 -> -1.072\n        hour11: (-0.067 -3.483 -2.277) = -5.827 -> -5.827/3 = -1.942333 -> -1.942\n        hour12: (-0.804 -4.086 -1.808) = -6.698 -> -6.698/3 = -2.232667 -> -2.233\n        hour13: (-0.536 -3.885 -1.474) = -5.895 -> -5.895/3 = -1.965 -> -1.965\n        hour14: (0.000 -3.148 -1.005) = -4.153 -> -4.153/3 = -1.384333 -> -1.384\n        hour15: (-0.737 -3.014 + 1.340) = -2.411 -> -2.411/3 = -0.803667 -> -0.804\n        hour16: (-1.474 -4.153 -0.670) = -6.297 -> -6.297/3 = -2.099 -> -2.099\n        hour17: (-1.072 -4.086 -1.139) = -6.297 -> -6.297/3 = -2.099 -> -2.099\n        hour18: (-2.880 -4.756 -1.407) = -9.043 -> -9.043/3 = -3.014333 -> -3.014\n        hour19: (-2.210 -4.756 -1.340) = -8.306 -> -8.306/3 = -2.768667 -> -2.769\n        hour20: (-1.741 -4.421 -1.407) = -7.569 -> -7.569/3 = -2.523 -> -2.523\n        hour21: (-1.875 -4.555 -2.210) = -8.640 -> -8.640/3 = -2.880 -> -2.880\n        hour22: (-0.603 -4.555 -1.273) = -6.431 -> -6.431/3 = -2.143667 -> -2.144\n        hour23: (-1.942 -3.014 -0.067) = -5.023 -> -5.023/3 = -1.674333 -> -1.674\n\n 30.

Now we generate 4 days: 2017-09-02, 2017-09-03, 2017-09-04, 2017-09-05.\n\n 32. We write the data in the format.\n\n 33. Note: The dates must be generated as:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-02 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-02 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-02 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-03 00:00:00 ... and so on.\n\n 34. We output 96 rows.\n\n 35. We must output in the exact string format as the input.\n\n 36. We write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n 37.
