        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) as seen from the provided 4 days.\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 records is complete (no missing values in the given snippet).\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method that can capture seasonality. Given the hourly data and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model or a simple seasonal naive approach.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. Since we are only the past 96 points and they are complete, we can proceed to forecast.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is exactly 4 days) and we have a strong daily seasonality (period=24), we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the day by taking the same hour from the last available day (or an average of the same hour over the last few days?).\n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that repeats every day, but also there might be a weekly pattern? However, we only have 4 days of data, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast the next 4 days, we can use the last day (2017-05-16) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n However, let's look at the pattern:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-05-13): \n        Starts around 4.75, then drops to negative in the day and rises again in the evening.\n\n   Day 2 (2017-05-14): \n        Similar pattern but with different values.\n\n   Day 3 (2017-05-15): \n        The pattern is different: the values are higher and the drop during the day is less severe.\n\n   Day 4 (2017-05-16): \n        Again, similar to the first two days but with a drop.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, and the pattern is not exactly repeating, we might consider using the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for the next 4 days? \n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided past data there are none. We are to forecast 96 points.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model like Holt-Winters with seasonality (but we have only 4 days, so 4 seasonal periods, which is minimal). \n\n However, the problem: we are an expert and we must provide the forecast. Since the data is limited, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 available days.\n\n   For example, for hour 00:00:00:\n        Day1: 4.756, Day2: 4.220, Day3: 9.243, Day4: 4.086 -> average = (4.756+4.220+9.243+4.086)/4 = 5.57625\n\n   Then we use this average for the same hour in each of the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the pattern might be evolving. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights? \n\n However, without more data, we stick to the simple average.\n\n But wait: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not been given any missing values in the past 96, so we assume the past is complete.\n\n However, the forecast must be for 96 points. We are going to generate:\n\n   Dates: from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of the past 4 days for each hour. Then for each hour in the day (0 to 23) we compute the average.\n\n   Then we repeat that averaged day for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a trend? Let's see the 00:00 values: \n        2017-05-13: 4.756\n        2017-05-14: 4.220\n        2017-05-15: 9.243\n        2017-05-16: 4.086\n\n There is no clear trend. So the average might be acceptable.\n\n However, we can also that the pattern on 2017-05-15 is different (higher). It might be a weekday vs weekend? But we don't have the day of the week.\n\n Since we are limited by the data, we will use the average method.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour of the day from the timestamp for each record in the past 96.\n\n   Step 2: Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n   Step 3: For the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   Step 4: Format the output.\n\n Let's do the calculation for the first few hours:\n\n   Hour 0: (4.756 + 4.220 + 9.243 + 4.086) / 4 = 5.57625\n   Hour 1: (4.488 + 4.086 + 9.109 + 4.756) / 4 = 5.60975\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not encountered any in the past, so we are safe.\n\n But what if in the future we had to handle missing values? We are not given any, so we skip.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model? But with only 4 days, it's hard. We go with the average.\n\n Let's consider: the last day (2017-05-16) might be the most representative? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n We'll stick to the average.\n\n Implementation in code (if we were to code) but we are to output the data.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   Start date: 2017-05-17 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-05-17 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n   That's 4*24 = 96 records.\n\n   For each record, we take the hour of the day and assign the precomputed average for that hour.\n\n However, note: the data we are given ends at 2017-05-16 23:00:00. The next day starts at 2017-05-17 00:00:00.\n\n We'll compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (2017-05-13 00:00:00, 2017-05-14 00:00:00, 2017-05-15 00:00:00, 2017-05-16 00:00:00) -> [4.756, 4.220, 9.243, 4.086] -> mean = (4.756+4.220+9.243+4.086)/4 = 22.305/4 = 5.57625 -> 5.576\n   hour1: (4.488, 4.086, 9.109, 4.756) -> (4.488+4.086+9.109+4.756) = 22.439 -> 22.439/4 = 5.60975 -> 5.610\n   hour2: (4.957, 3.885, 9.176, 4.823) -> (4.957+3.885+9.176+4.823)=22.841 -> 5.71025 -> 5.710\n   hour3: (4.488, 3.952, 8.573, 5.224) -> (4.488+3.952+8.573+5.224)=22.237 -> 5.55925 -> 5.559\n   hour4: (4.622, 3.952, 9.779, 5.425) -> (4.622+3.952+9.779+5.425)=23.778 -> 5.9445 -> 5.945\n   hour5: (6.162, 5.492, 10.717, 6.229) -> (6.162+5.492+10.717+6.229)=28.6 -> 7.15\n   ... and so on.\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values.
