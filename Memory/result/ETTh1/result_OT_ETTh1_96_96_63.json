        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are no missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. Since the provided data does not have any missing values, \n    we assume that the forecasting method should be robust to missing values, but for now we have a complete series.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we have to generate the timestamps and the forecasted OT.\n\n 4. The timestamps: \n    The last given timestamp is 2017-03-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, \n    we might consider models like:\n      - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n      - Exponential Smoothing\n      - Prophet (if we suspect seasonality)\n\n    However, note that the data shows:\n      - Daily seasonality: the temperature rises during the day and falls at night.\n      - Also, there is a drop in the last day (March 13) that might be an anomaly.\n\n    Since we are only given 4 days, it's challenging to capture long-term patterns. But we can try to capture daily seasonality (24-hour cycle).\n\n 6. We'll use an approach that can handle seasonality. Given the data size, we can try:\n      - Seasonal Decomposition and then forecast the components? (but 4 days might be too short for daily seasonality with 24 points per day)\n      - Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive method? But that might not capture trends.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can use a model that uses the last day as a base and adjust with the trend? But the problem is non-trivial.\n\n 8. We'll use an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA). We have to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24).\n\n 9. However, note that the data has a clear daily pattern (period=24). But with only 4 days, we might not have enough data to fit a SARIMA model with 24 seasonal lag.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: \n        - We'll use the time series and try to model with a linear trend and daily seasonality using dummy variables? \n        - But 4 days is very short.\n\n 11. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only required to provide the next 96 points, we can use a method that is simple and robust.\n\n 12. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern. We can compute the average daily pattern from the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? \n     However, the last day (March 13) is very low and might be an anomaly. \n\n 13. Steps for a simple method:\n      a. Remove the trend? We can compute the moving average to get the trend and then the seasonal component.\n      b. But with only 4 days, we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days? Then we get a 24-hour pattern.\n\n     However, the data for the 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2017-03-10 (Friday)\n        Day2: 2017-03-11 (Saturday)\n        Day3: 2017-03-12 (Sunday)\n        Day4: 2017-03-13 (Monday)\n\n     We see that the last day (Monday) is much lower. This might be due to a change in load or external factors.\n\n 14. Given the challenge, we might use the last day (March 13) as the base and then add the average daily variation? \n     But the average daily variation might be computed from the previous days? \n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal forecast: \n        Forecast for hour h of day 5 (March 14) = value of hour h of day 4 (March 13) \n        but that would just repeat the last day? \n\n     But the last day is very cold? and we might expect a similar pattern but with a possible trend? \n\n 16. We can try to fit a linear trend to the entire series and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 17. Given the time and the requirement, we decide to use a simple average of the daily patterns and then project the last point?\n\n 18. However, the problem says the data has missing values? But in the given data we don't have any. So for forecasting we assume the model is built on the given data.\n\n 19. We'll use an automated model: \n     We'll use the `statsmodels` library to fit a SARIMA model. But note: we are in a simulated environment and cannot run code? \n\n 20. Since we are to provide the answer, we must generate the forecast. We can use a precomputed method? \n\n 21. Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n        - Compute the average daily profile from the first 3 days (because the 4th day is an anomaly? or use all 4 days?).\n        - Then, we set the level of the forecast to be the last day's average? \n\n     Steps for the simple method:\n\n        a. Group by hour of the day (0-23) and compute the average for each hour over the 4 days? \n           But the 4th day is very different. So we might use the last two days? \n\n        b. We note the overall trend: the temperature is dropping. We can compute the average of each day:\n\n            Day1: 2017-03-10: average = (12.17+12.17+...+10.83)/24 -> we don't have to compute exactly, but we can see the values are around 10-17.\n            Day2: 2017-03-11: similar but a bit lower? \n            Day3: 2017-03-12: lower still? \n            Day4: 2017-03-13: very low (down to 0.774 and up to 6.05)\n\n        c. This suggests a downward trend. We can fit a linear regression to the entire series to get the trend? \n\n        d. Then, we can remove the trend and compute the seasonal indices.\n\n        e. Then, we forecast the trend for the next 96 hours and add the seasonal indices.\n\n 22. Steps in detail:\n\n     Step 1: Create a time index (t) from 0 to 95.\n     Step 2: Fit a linear regression: OT = a + b*t. Let the trend component be T_t = a + b*t.\n     Step 3: Compute the detrended series: Y_t = OT_t - T_t.\n     Step 4: For the detrended series, compute the average for each hour of the day (0-23). We have 4 days, so 4 values for each hour. \n              We can average them to get the seasonal index for that hour. Let S_h for h in 0..23.\n     Step 5: Normalize the seasonal indices so that they add to zero? (so that they are deviations) -> not necessary for additive model.\n\n     Step 6: Forecast the trend for the next 96 hours: T_{96} to T_{191} (t=96 to 191).\n     Step 7: For each hour in the forecast period, add the corresponding seasonal index.\n\n        For example, the first forecast hour (2017-03-14 00:00:00) is hour 0 of the day -> S_0.\n\n        So, forecast = T_{96} + S_0.\n\n     Step 8: But note: the trend we removed was linear. The linear trend might not be the best if the drop on the last day is an anomaly.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we can use the last day's detrended values as the seasonal pattern? \n\n 24. Given the anomaly on the last day, we decide to use the average of the first three days for the seasonal pattern? \n\n 25. However, the problem does not specify the cause of the drop. We must forecast based on the pattern.\n\n 26. We'll use the entire 4 days to compute the seasonal indices? \n\n 27. Let's do the computation:\n\n     First, we compute the linear trend. We'll use the linear regression on the entire series.\n\n     We have 96 points. We set t = [0,1,...,95].\n\n     We find:\n        slope (b) and intercept (a) such that minimizes the sum of squares.\n\n     We can compute:\n\n        mean_t = 47.5\n        mean_OT = mean of all OT\n\n        b = sum((t_i - mean_t)*(OT_i - mean_OT)) / sum((t_i - mean_t)**2)\n        a = mean_OT - b * mean_t\n\n     Then, we compute the detrended series: D_t = OT_t - (a + b*t)\n\n     Then, we group the detrended values by hour (0 to 23). There are 4 values for each hour (from 4 days).\n\n        For hour h (0<=h<=23), we have:\n            h, h+24, h+48, h+72.\n\n        S_h = (D_h + D_{h+24} + D_{h+48} + D_{h+72]) / 4\n\n     Then, we forecast for t=96 to 191:\n\n        T_t = a + b*t\n        Then, for a time t, the hour of the day h = t mod 24.\n\n        Forecast_t = T_t + S_h\n\n 28. But note: the last day (t=72 to 95) has a very low trend. The linear trend might be negative? \n\n 29. We'll do a quick estimation of the linear trend:\n\n        The first few points: around 12, the last few: around 5. So over 96 hours, the drop is about 7. So slope b ~ -7/96 ~ -0.073.\n\n 30. However, the drop is not linear? It drops suddenly on the last day.\n\n 31. Given the sudden drop, we might consider that the trend is not linear. We might use only the last two days to project the trend? \n\n 32. But the problem requires 96 points. We must provide a forecast.\n\n 33. We decide to use the entire series for the linear trend and the entire series for the seasonal indices.\n\n 34. We'll simulate the computation:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the linear trend coefficients.\n\n        Let t = [0,1,2,...,95]\n        Let OT = [12.17, 12.17, 12.522, ... , 5.979]\n\n        We can compute:\n\n            sum_t = 0+1+...+95 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n            sum_OT = sum of all OT values.\n\n            sum_t_OT = 0*OT0 + 1*OT1 + ... + 95*OT95\n\n            sum_t_sq = 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = 95*96*191/6 = 95*16*191 = 95*3056 = 290320\n\n        Actually, we can use:\n\n            b = (n*sum(t_i * OT_i) - sum(t_i)*sum(OT_i)) / (n*sum(t_i^2) - (sum(t_i))^2)\n\n        n=96\n\n        We don't have the exact sum_OT and sum_t_OT, so we cannot compute without the data.\n\n 35. Since we are an expert, we can write a program? But we are to provide the answer in text.\n\n 36. Alternatively, we can use a simpler trend: use the average of the first day and the last day to get the slope? \n\n        Day1 average: let's compute quickly:\n\n            Day1: 2017-03-10: \n                values: 12.17,12.17,12.52,12.52,12.03,11.89,10.97,10.97,11.19,12.59,13.58,13.86,15.20,16.11,15.69,16.32,17.09,15.34,14.98,14.63,13.72,13.09,11.96,10.83\n\n                average1 = (12.17*2 + 12.52*2 + 12.03+11.89+10.97*2+11.19+12.59+13.58+13.86+15.20+16.11+15.69+16.32+17.09+15.34+14.98+14.63+13.72+13.09+11.96+10.83) / 24\n\n                We can approximate: \n                    Let's add: \n                        12.17*2 = 24.34\n                        12.52*2 = 25.04\n                        12.03+11.89 = 23.92\n                        10.97*2 = 21.94\n                        11.19\n                        12.59\n                        13.58\n                        13.86\n                        15.20\n                        16.11\n                        15.69\n                        16.32\n                        17.09\n                        15.34\n                        14.98\n                        14.63\n                        13.72\n                        13.09\n                        11.96\n                        10.83\n\n                Sum = 24.34+25.04=49.38 +23.92=73.3 +21.94=95.24 +11.19=106.43 +12.59=119.02 +13.58=132.6 +13.86=146.46 +15.20=161.66 +16.11=177.77 +15.69=193.46 +16.32=209.78 +17.09=226.87 +15.34=242.21 +14.98=257.19 +14.63=271.82 +13.72=285.54 +13.09=298.63 +11.96=310.59 +10.83=321.42\n\n                average1 = 321.42 / 24 = 13.3925\n\n        Day4: 2017-03-13: \n            values: 7.316,5.628,4.573,7.105,6.964,4.15,2.04,2.673,2.251,2.603,1.688,1.407,0.774,1.337,3.869,3.447,0.985,3.236,2.814,5.346,5.557,5.557,6.05,5.979\n\n            Sum = 7.316+5.628=12.944 +4.573=17.517 +7.105=24.622 +6.964=31.586 +4.15=35.736 +2.04=37.776 +2.673=40.449 +2.251=42.7 +2.603=45.303 +1.688=46.991 +1.407=48.398 +0.774=49.172 +1.337=50.509 +3.869=54.378 +3.447=57.825 +0.985=58.81 +3.236=62.046 +2.814=64.86 +5.346=70.206 +5.557=75.763 +5.557=81.32 +6.05=87.37 +5.979=93.349\n\n            average4 = 93.349 / 24 = 3.88954\n\n        Then the slope over 3 days (72 hours) from day1 to day4? \n            But note: the first data point of day1 is at t0, and the first of day4 is at t72.\n\n            So the change in trend: from 13.3925 to 3.88954 over 72 hours? \n            Then the slope b = (3.88954 - 13.3925) / 72 = (-9.50296)/72 = -0.132\n\n        Then for the next 96 hours, we project the trend linearly with this b? \n\n        But this is a very steep decline. And the last day might be an anomaly.\n\n 37. Given the complexity and the fact that we must provide an answer, we decide to use a naive method: \n        We will use the last day's values as the base and then add the average daily variation from the previous days? \n\n 38. We can also try to use an exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality? \n\n 39. We decide to use the following simple approach:\n\n        We will take the average of the last 24 hours (the last day) and then apply the average hourly pattern from the entire 4 days.\n\n        But note: the last day is already a full day. So we can use it as the base and then adjust by the overall hourly pattern? \n\n 40. We do:\n\n        Let base = the last day's average = 3.88954 (as above)\n\n        Then, we compute the average hourly pattern (without detrending) for the 4 days:\n\n            For hour h (0-23), let M_h = (OT_h + OT_{h+24} + OT_{h+48} + OT_{h+72}) / 4\n\n        Then, the overall average of these M_h is the grand average, say M.\n\n        Then, the seasonal index for hour h is: S_h = M_h - M   (additive model)\n\n        Then, for the next 96 hours, we forecast for hour i in [0,95] (which corresponds to hour h = i mod 24, and day = i//24):\n\n            We set the level for the day d as: L_d = base + d * (trend_slope)   [but we don't have a trend projection for future days]\n\n        Alternatively, we can assume the level for the next 4 days is the same as the last day? \n\n        Then: \n            Forecast for hour h = base + S_h\n\n        But then we are ignoring any trend.\n\n 41. Given the steep drop, we might assume the drop stops and the temperature stabilizes? \n\n 42. We decide to use the last day's pattern and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n\n        That is: \n            March 14: same as March 13\n            March 15: same as March 13\n            March 16: same as March 13\n            March 17: same as March 13\n\n        But then we are ignoring the seasonality of the previous days? \n\n 43. Given the anomaly on March 13, it might be a new normal? \n\n 44. We'll provide the forecast by repeating the last 24 hours four times.\n\n        The last 24 hours are from 2017-03-13 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00.\n\n        So the forecast for:\n\n            2017-03-14 00:00:00 = 7.316\n            2017-03-14 01:00:00 = 5.628\n            ... until 2017-03-17 23:00:00 = 5.979\n\n 45. But the problem says there might be missing values in the data? In the given data there are none, so we use the last day.\n\n 46. However, the last day has very low values and might not be representative. But without more data, we use this.\n\n 47. We'll output the next 96 hours by repeating the last 24 hours four times.\n\n 48. Generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-14 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-03-17 23:00:00\n\n        We have 96 hours.\n\n 49. The last 24 hours of OT (from 2017-03-13 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00) are:\n\n        [7.316000, 5.628000, 4.573000, 7.105000, 6.964000, 4.150000, 2.040000, 2.673000, 2.251000, 2.603000, 1.688000, 1.407000, 0.774000, 1.337000, 3.869000, 3.447000, 0.985000, 3.236000, 2.814000, 5.346000, 5.557000, 5.557000, 6.050000, 5.979000]\n\n     We repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 50. The dates:\n\n        We start from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 and go hourly.\n\n        We'll generate:\n\n          2017-03-14 00:00:00 -> 7.316000\n          2017-03-14 01:00:00 -> 5.628000\n          ...\n          2017-03-14 23:00:00 -> 5.979000\n          2017-03-15 00:00:00 -> 7.316000\n          ... until 2017-03-17 23:00:00 -> 5.979000\n\n 51.

But note: the last day in the given data is 2017-03-13, so the next day is 2017-03-14.\n\n 55. We output exactly as above.\n\n However, note that the last day's data might be an anomaly and this forecast might not be accurate, but with the information given, it is a straightforward approach.\n\n If we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model.\n",
