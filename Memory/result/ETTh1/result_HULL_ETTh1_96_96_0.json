        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-01 00:00:00 to 2016-07-04 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 time steps and the data is relatively short (only 4 days), we can use a model that can capture:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours cycle) because we see patterns repeating every day.\n   - The data shows fluctuations and some level of non-stationarity.\n\n However, note that the data has only 4 days, so we have limited history.\n\n We can use a model like:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n But note: the data has only 4 days (96 points) and we are forecasting 4 days (96 points). This is challenging.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method like:\n   - Using the last available day (or average of past days) as a naive forecast, but that might not capture trends.\n\n However, looking at the data, there is a clear daily pattern but also a trend? Let's see:\n\n   Day 1: min around 1.741, max around 3.282\n   Day 2: min around 3.014, max around 5.760\n   Day 3: min around 4.153, max around 5.760\n   Day 4: min around 3.885, max around 6.497\n\n There seems to be an increasing trend? But also note the last day (July 4) has a drop at 19:00 to 3.885 and then rises again.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we can use a model that automatically captures seasonality and trend.\n\n We'll use:\n   - Facebook Prophet: which is robust to missing data and can handle seasonality and trends. But note we have only 4 days.\n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n Since we are to provide a forecast and the data is small, we can do:\n\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n\n   However, note that there is a trend: the values are generally increasing. So we might adjust by the overall level.\n\n   We can do:\n     - Decompose the series into trend and seasonal components, then project the trend and add the seasonal component.\n\n But given the short data, we can also use a moving average method with seasonality.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (July 4) as the base and adjust by the average change from one day to the next? \n\n However, the problem requires 96 points and we must provide the complete data.\n\n Given the constraints, I am an expert and must provide a forecast. I choose to use a simple method:\n\n   We will compute the hourly average for the 4 days and then adjust by a linear trend.\n\n   Steps:\n     a) Extract the hour of the day for each record.\n     b) Group by hour and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days -> this gives a base pattern.\n     c) But we see an upward trend? Let's check the daily average:\n\n        Day1: average = (2.009+2.076+...+2.880)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n          We see values: min 1.741, max 3.282 -> average around 2.5? \n        Actually, let me compute:\n\n        Day1: \n          values: [2.009,2.076,1.741,1.942,1.942,2.143,2.947,3.282,3.014,2.545,2.545,2.545,2.545,2.679,2.947,3.148,2.411,2.344,2.880,3.014,3.014,2.947,2.947,2.880]\n          sum = 60.0 (approx) -> average = 2.5\n\n        Day2: \n          [3.081,3.014,3.148,3.081,3.081,3.282,3.282,3.215,3.282,3.215,4.957,5.425,4.957,5.760,4.689,5.157,4.823,4.823,4.689,4.354,4.153,4.220,4.622,4.287]\n          sum = 100.0 (approx) -> average = 4.17\n\n        Day3:\n          [5.425,5.224,4.689,4.153,4.756,4.689,5.224,4.622,4.421,4.220,5.090,5.358,5.023,4.957,5.425,5.425,4.890,5.157,4.957,4.890,4.890,4.890,5.760,5.760]\n          sum = 120.0 (approx) -> average = 5.0\n\n        Day4:\n          [5.894,4.957,4.823,5.492,4.823,5.559,5.425,6.095,5.961,6.296,6.229,5.559,5.894,5.425,6.028,6.095,5.023,5.090,4.957,3.885,4.086,4.823,4.890,6.497]\n          sum = 125.0 (approx) -> average = 5.2\n\n        The daily averages: [2.5, 4.17, 5.0, 5.2] -> increasing.\n\n     d) We can fit a linear trend to these daily averages and then project the next 4 days (days 5,6,7,8) and then use the hourly pattern relative to the daily average.\n\n   How:\n     Let:\n        Day index: 1,2,3,4 -> averages: [2.5, 4.17, 5.0, 5.2]\n        We fit a linear regression: average = a + b * day\n\n        Then for day5,6,7,8: we get the daily average.\n\n     Then for each hour in the day, we have a multiplicative (or additive) seasonal factor.\n\n        We can compute the hourly factor as: (value on that hour) / (daily average) for each day and then average over the 4 days.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, for hour h in day d (d=5,6,7,8):\n            forecast = (daily_avg[d]) * (seasonal_factor[h])\n\n     But note: the pattern might be additive? Let's see the variation: the daily average changes, and the hourly pattern might be additive in the log scale? \n\n     Alternatively, we can do additive decomposition:\n\n        seasonal_factor[h] = average( value[h] - daily_avg[day] ) for each day.\n\n        Then forecast = daily_avg[d] + seasonal_factor[h]\n\n     However, the data does not show constant amplitude? The amplitude increases with the level? \n\n        Example: on day1, the max is 3.282 and min 1.741 -> range 1.54\n        day2: max 5.760, min 3.014 -> range 2.746\n        day3: max 5.760, min 4.153 -> range 1.607\n        day4: max 6.497, min 3.885 -> range 2.612\n\n     The range is not constant. So multiplicative seasonality might be more appropriate.\n\n     We can do:\n\n        seasonal_factor[h] = average( value[h] / daily_avg[day] )   [then normalized?]\n\n        Then forecast = daily_avg[d] * seasonal_factor[h]\n\n     But note: the daily_avg[d] is the average of the day, so the average of the seasonal factors for a day should be 1.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute daily averages for the 4 days.\n        Step 2: For each hour in [0,23] and each day, compute: value / daily_avg[day]\n        Step 3: For each hour, average the ratios over the 4 days -> this gives the seasonal factor for that hour.\n        Step 4: Fit a linear model to the daily averages (for days 1 to 4) to predict daily averages for days 5,6,7,8.\n        Step 5: For each day in [5,6,7,8] and each hour in [0,23]:\n                forecast = (predicted_avg[day]) * (seasonal_factor[hour])\n\n     However, we have only 4 days, so the linear model might be overfitted? We can use linear regression with two points? \n\n        Let: \n          day: [1,2,3,4] ->        X = [1,2,3,4]\n          Y = [2.5, 4.17, 5.0, 5.2]\n\n        We can do:\n\n          slope = (Y[4]-Y[1]) / (4-1) = (5.2-2.5)/3 = 0.9\n          Then for day5: 5.2 + 0.9 = 6.1\n          day6: 6.1 + 0.9 = 7.0\n          day7: 7.0 + 0.9 = 7.9\n          day8: 7.9 + 0.9 = 8.8\n\n        But is that sustainable?

write the answer in the required format.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"And your final answer must follow the format\", so we output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        date,HULL\n
