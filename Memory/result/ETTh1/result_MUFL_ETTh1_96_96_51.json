        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The data has some missing values (represented as NaN in the original data, but in the provided sample there are no explicit NaNs, so we are told to be aware of missing values in the entire dataset).\n However, the provided 96 points do not have any missing values? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must handle that.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days).\n 2. We must handle missing values in the provided data. But in the given 96 points, there are no NaNs? \n    Let me check: The provided data has 96 rows and two columns: date and MUFL. The MUFL column has numbers, no explicit NaN.\n\n 3. However, the problem states: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\"\n    So, we should check for missing values and impute them if necessary.\n\n 4. Since the provided data in the example does not have missing values, we can proceed. But to be safe, we will write code that can handle missing values.\n\n 5. We are to forecast the next 96 hours. We'll use a time series model that can handle hourly data and potential seasonality.\n\n 6. Given the data, we observe:\n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, the values drop during the day (around 9-15) and rise in the evening and night.\n\n 7. We can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any)\n    - Seasonality (with a period of 24 hours)\n\n 8. Since we are only given 96 points (4 days), we have limited data. We can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with a seasonal period of 24.\n    - Or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with a seasonality of 24.\n\n 9. However, note that the data has negative values? So we cannot use models that require strictly positive data (like multiplicative seasonality without transformation).\n\n 10. Steps in code:\n     a. Check for missing values and impute (using linear interpolation or forward fill, etc.)\n     b. Split the data into training (the given 96 points) and we want to forecast the next 96.\n     c. Fit a model (we'll choose one that is suitable for short-term forecasting with seasonality).\n\n 11. Given the small data size, we can try:\n     - SARIMA: We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). We can use auto_arima to select the best parameters.\n\n 12. But note: We are not allowed to run code? We are an expert and must provide the forecasted data.\n\n 13. However, the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\".\n\n 14. Since we are an expert, we can simulate the process and then output the forecast.\n\n 15. But note: We are in a text-based environment and cannot run code. So we must describe the process and then provide the forecast.\n\n 16. Alternatively, the problem expects the forecasted data in the specified format. So we have to generate 96 numbers.\n\n 17. How can we do that without running code? We must rely on a method and then provide the numbers.\n\n 18. Given the constraints, I will use a simple method: \n     - We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days and then adjust for any trend.\n\n 19. But 4 days is very short. We can also use a naive method: use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n     But the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, we don't see missing.\n\n 20. Since the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", we must have imputed them. But in the given data, there are none.\n\n 21. Approach:\n     - We will use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 22. However, we note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the last 4 days:\n\n     Day1: 2017-01-21\n     Day2: 2017-01-22\n     Day3: 2017-01-23\n     Day4: 2017-01-24\n\n     We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over these 4 days.\n\n 23. But note: the last day is 2017-01-24, so the next 96 hours would be from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00.\n\n 24. We can compute:\n\n     For hour h (where h from 0 to 23), the average of the 4 days for that hour.\n\n     Then, we use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 25. However, we must account for the fact that the pattern might change? But with only 4 days, we don't have much to go on.\n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-24) and use it as the forecast for the next day? But that would be too naive.\n\n 27. Considering the data, we see that the values are not exactly repeating. We can try to compute the average and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 4 days.\n\n 28. But to keep it simple and given the lack of data, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 29. Steps for calculation:\n\n     Let's group by hour (ignoring the day) and then take the mean.\n\n 30. The data:\n\n     Hour 0: [9.879, 9.452, 8.066, 7.000] -> mean = (9.879+9.452+8.066+7.000)/4 = 8.59925\n     Hour 1: [9.843, 8.777, 6.716, 6.148] -> mean = (9.843+8.777+6.716+6.148)/4 = 7.871\n     ... and so on.\n\n 31. Then the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n     2017-01-25 00:00:00: 8.59925\n     and then for 2017-01-25 01:00:00: 7.871\n\n     and so on, repeating the same 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n 32. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We don't see any in the provided 96, so we assume we have 4 complete days.\n\n 33. However, the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", so if there were missing values we would have imputed. But in this case, we don't have any.\n\n 34. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list of 24 values, each being the average of the 4 days at that hour.\n\n 35. But note: the data starts at 2017-01-21 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 36. We'll compute:\n\n     hour0: (9.879 + 9.452 + 8.066 + 7.000) / 4 = 8.59925\n     hour1: (9.843 + 8.777 + 6.716 + 6.148) / 4 = 7.871\n     hour2: (8.209 + 7.995 + 6.325 + 5.010) / 4 = 6.88475\n     hour3: (8.848 + 8.102 + 6.076 + 5.224) / 4 = 7.0625\n     hour4: (9.417 + 8.102 + 6.610 + 5.188) / 4 = 7.32925\n     hour5: (9.097 + 5.863 + 6.005 + 5.259) / 4 = 6.556\n     hour6: (8.493 + 5.366 + 6.467 + 4.975) / 4 = 6.32525\n     hour7: (9.985 + 7.604 + 7.782 + 6.219) / 4 = 7.8925\n     hour8: (10.767 + 8.315 + 7.818 + 7.604) / 4 = 8.626\n     hour9: (0.036 + 1.599 + 0.959 + 0.107) / 4 = 0.67525\n     hour10: (-3.163 + -2.594 + -3.127 + -4.975) / 4 = -3.46475\n     hour11: (-3.482 + -4.300 + -6.254 + -6.787) / 4 = -5.20575\n     hour12: (-7.320 + -5.970 + -8.138 + -6.787) / 4 = -7.05375\n     hour13: (-6.503 + -5.686 + -7.320 + -3.980) / 4 = -5.87225\n     hour14: (-5.259 + -4.797 + -4.051 + -2.097) / 4 = -4.051\n     hour15: (-1.990 + -1.457 + -3.376 + -1.990) / 4 = -2.20325\n     hour16: (1.990 + 1.421 + -0.711 + 3.838) / 4 = 1.6345\n     hour17: (6.574 + 6.610 + 6.112 + 7.214) / 4 = 6.6275\n     hour18: (7.924 + 7.960 + 7.000 + 7.995) / 4 = 7.71975\n     hour19: (9.879 + 10.056 + 8.884 + 9.488) / 4 = 9.57675\n     hour20: (10.554 + 11.016 + 10.270 + 10.554) / 4 =  Wait, the last day at 20:00 is 10.554? \n          Actually, the last day (2017-01-24) at 20:00 is 10.554? \n          Let me check: \n          2017-01-24 20:00:00 10.554 -> yes.\n\n          So: (10.554 + 11.016 + 10.270 + 10.554) -> but wait, the first day (21st) at 20:00 is 10.554? \n          Actually, 2017-01-21 20:00:00 is 10.554, 2017-01-22 20:00:00 is 11.016, 2017-01-23 20:00:00 is 10.270, 2017-01-24 20:00:00 is 10.554.\n\n          So: (10.554 + 11.016 + 10.270 + 10.554) / 4 = 10.5985\n\n     hour21: (12.508 + 10.838 + 10.732 + 10.376) / 4 = 11.1135\n     hour22: (11.975 + 10.874 + 10.376 + 9.132) / 4 = 10.58925\n     hour23: (10.625 + 8.955 + 8.173 + 7.676) / 4 = 8.85725\n\n 37. Now, the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-01-25 00:00:00) will be:\n\n     2017-01-25 00:00:00: 8.59925\n     2017-01-25 01:00:00: 7.871\n     2017-01-25 02:00:00: 6.88475\n     ... until 2017-01-25 23:00:00: 8.85725\n\n     and then repeat the same 24 values for 2017-01-26, 2017-01-27, 2017-01-28.\n\n 38. But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning the next 96 hours? The data is hourly.\n\n 39. We must generate 96 rows.\n\n 40. Format the dates: \n     Start: 2017-01-25 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-01-25 01:00:00 ... until 2017-01-25 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n     Then 2017-01-26 00:00:00 ... until 2017-01-26 23:00:00 -> next 24\n     Then 2017-01-27 00:00:00 ... until 2017-01-27 23:00:00 -> next 24\n     Then 2017-01-28 00:00:00 ... until 2017-01-28 23:00:00 -> next 24 -> total 96.\n\n 41. We'll use the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n 42. However, note that the problem might expect a more sophisticated method? But with only 4 days, it's hard to do more.\n\n 43. Alternatively, we could use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without code, we choose the average method.\n\n 44. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-25 00:00:00  8.599\n2017-01-25 01:00:00  7.871\n2017-01-25 02:00:00  6.885\n...\n2017-01-28 23:00:00  8.857\n```\n\n 45. We rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 46. But note: the input has 3 decimal places. We will round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n     hour0: 8.59925 -> 8.599\n     hour1: 7.871 -> 7.871\n     But note: 7.871 is already 3 decimal places? Actually, we have to round to 3 decimal places.\n\n     We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. Recompute and round:\n\n     hour0: 8.59925 -> 8.599\n     hour1: 7.871 -> 7.871\n     But 7.871 is 7.871, which is 3 decimal places? Actually, it's 3 decimal places.\n\n     We'll do:\n\n        hour0: round(8.59925, 3) -> 8.599\n        hour1: round(7.871, 3) -> 7.871\n        hour2: round(6.88475, 3) -> 6.885\n        hour3: round(7.0625, 3) -> 7.063\n        because 7.0625 rounded to 3 decimals is 7.063? \n        Actually, 7.0625 is exactly halfway, and we round to the nearest even? \n        But in practice, we can use standard rounding: 7.0625 -> 7.063.\n\n        However, let's do:\n\n        hour3: 7.0625 -> 7.063 (if we round half up) but note that the problem uses 3 decimals and the input has 3.\n\n        We'll use: round(x, 3) with standard rounding.\n\n 49. We'll compute each and round to 3 decimals.\n\n 50. Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places by formatting.\n\n 51. Since the problem says \"complete data\", we must have 96 rows.\n\n 52. Let's generate the data:\n\n     We have 24 values for the day:\n\n        hour0: 8.599\n        hour1: 7.871\n        hour2: 6.885\n        hour3: 7.063\n        hour4: 7.329\n        hour5: 6.556\n        hour6: 6.325\n        hour7: 7.893\n        hour8: 8.626\n        hour9: 0.675\n        hour10: -3.465\n        hour11: -5.206\n        hour12: -7.054\n        hour13: -5.872\n        hour14: -4.051\n        hour15: -2.203\n        hour16: 1.635\n        hour17: 6.628\n        hour18: 7.720\n        hour19: 9.577\n        hour20: 10.599\n        hour21: 11.114\n        hour22: 10.589\n        hour23: 8.857\n\n 53. Then we repeat this list 4 days.\n\n 54. Now, we output the dates:\n\n     Day1: 2017-01-25\n        from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n     Day2: 2017-01-26\n     Day3: 2017-01-27\n     Day4: 2017-01-28\n\n 55. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-25 00:00:00  8.599\n2017-01-25 01:00:00  7.871\n2017-01-25 02:00:00  6.885\n2017-01-25 03:00:00  7.063\n2017-01-25 04:00:00  7.329\n2017-01-25 05:00:00  6.556\n2017-01-25 06:00:00  6.325\n2017-01-25 07:00:00  7.893\n2017-01-25 08:00:00  8.626\n2017-01-25 09:00:00  0.675\n2017-01-25 10:00:00 -3.465\n2017-01-25 11:00:00 -5.206\n2017-01-25 12:00:00 -7.054\n2017-01-25 13:00:00 -5.872\n2017-01-25 14:00:00 -4.051\n2017-01-25 15:00:00 -2.203\n2017-01-25 16:00:00  1.635\n2017-01-25 17:00:00  6.628\n2017-01-25 18:00:00  7.720\n2017-01-25 19:00:00  9.577\n2017-01-25 20:00:00 10.599\n2017-01-25 21:00:00 11.114\n2017-01-25 22:00:00 10.589\n2017-01-25 23:00:00  8.857\n2017-01-26 00:00:00  8.599\n2017-01-26 01:00:00  7.871\n... and so on until 2017-01-28 23:00:00\n\n```\n\n 56. We must write 96 rows.\n\n 57. But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", so we are generating 96.\n\n 58. We'll write the data in the same way as the input: two columns: date and MUFL.\n\n 59. We must not omit any content.\n\n 60. Let's write the full 96 rows.\n\n 61. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\", so we must write all 96.\n\n 62. We'll generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-01-25 00:00:00\n     Then add 1 hour until we have 96.\n\n 63. We'll create a list of dates:\n\n     from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n     start = datetime(2017,1,25,0,0,0)\n     then for i in range(96):\n         date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n 64. But we are not running code?
