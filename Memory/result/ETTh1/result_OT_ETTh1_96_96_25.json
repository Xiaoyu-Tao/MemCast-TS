        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of oil temperature.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious.\n 3. We are to use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length (96 points) and the need for 96-point forecast, we can use models like:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n    - Exponential Smoothing\n    - Prophet (if we suspect seasonality)\n    - LSTM or other deep learning models (but 96 points might be too short for training)\n\n However, note that the data is only 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast the next 4 days. The data shows a daily pattern (diurnal variation).\n\n Observing the data:\n   - The temperature drops during the night and rises during the day.\n   - The pattern repeats every 24 hours (24 data points per day).\n\n Approach:\n   We can use a seasonal model. Since the seasonality is 24 hours, we can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model.\n\n   Steps for SARIMA:\n     - Check stationarity: if not stationary, take differences (both seasonal and non-seasonal).\n     - We'll use auto_arima to find the best parameters, but note that we have limited data.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n     - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual, then forecast each component.\n\n   However, with only 4 days, it's challenging to capture long-term trends, but the daily seasonality is evident.\n\n   Another idea: use a naive seasonal method - forecast each hour of the next day by the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? \n     But we have exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can compute the average for each hour (0,1,...,23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n     However, that would be a flat forecast for each hour and might not capture any trend.\n\n   Considering the data: \n     Day 1 (2016-10-09): min ~15.687, max ~20.26\n     Day 2 (2016-10-10): min ~16.461, max ~20.118\n     Day 3 (2016-10-11): min ~13.436, max ~19.063\n     Day 4 (2016-10-12): min ~13.436, max ~18.923\n\n   There is a downward trend? But we have only 4 days. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). The Holt-Winters method can be applied to data with seasonality.\n\n   Given the constraints (only 96 points and 96 points to forecast), we can try:\n\n   Option 1: Seasonal Naive\n      Forecast for hour h of day 5 = average of hour h of day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n   But note: the last day (2016-10-12) has a lower temperature? So if we average, we might get a lower forecast.\n\n   Option 2: Use Holt-Winters (ExponentialSmoothing) with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n   We'll use Option 2 because it can capture the level, trend, and seasonality.\n\n   Steps for Holt-Winters:\n     - We have to set the seasonal period to 24.\n     - We'll use the model to fit the 96 points and then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n   However, note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the first and last points: \n        Start: 18.78, then 19.27, ... and the last point: 18.57.\n        The overall trend is not clear. We can use additive trend and additive seasonality.\n\n   We have to be cautious: with only 4 days, the trend might be overfitted.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a model that automatically selects the parameters (like auto_arima) but with seasonality.\n\n   Given the time and simplicity, we choose Holt-Winters.\n\n   Implementation in Python (using statsmodels) would be:\n\n        model = ExponentialSmoothing(series, seasonal_periods=24, trend='add', seasonal='add')\n        model_fit = model.fit()\n        forecast = model_fit.forecast(96)\n\n   But note: the data might have a downward trend? We can try without trend as well? \n\n   However, we are not actually running code, so we have to simulate the forecast.\n\n   But the problem: we are to provide the forecasted data. Since we cannot run code, we have to think of a method.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simple average by hour as a fallback.\n\n   Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (18.783001 + 16.461000 + 17.868000 + 13.507000) / 4 = 16.65475\n        hour1: (19.275000 + 16.882999 + 17.798000 + 13.436000) / 4 = 16.848\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   But this ignores any trend. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n   Another idea: use the last day's pattern? But the last day (2016-10-12) is lower than the others.\n\n   We can also use a weighted average? (more weight to recent days)\n\n   Let me do: \n        day1: weight 1\n        day2: weight 2\n        day3: weight 3\n        day4: weight 4\n\n   Then for hour0: (1*18.783001 + 2*16.461000 + 3*17.868000 + 4*13.507000) / (1+2+3+4) = (18.783 + 32.922 + 53.604 + 54.028) / 10 = 159.337/10 = 15.9337\n\n   This gives more weight to the last day which is the coldest.\n\n   But is that trend continuing? We don't know.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we'll go with the Holt-Winters method. However, without running the actual model, we have to approximate.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\n        Step 1: Remove the seasonality by averaging each hour and subtract to get the base level?\n        Step 2: Model the trend on the base level? Then add the seasonal component.\n\n   But again, without code, we have to make an estimate.\n\n   Considering the problem, we are to provide the data. We'll use the forecast from a Holt-Winters model that we would have run if we had the code.\n\n   However, since we are to provide the answer, we can generate the forecast by:\n\n        - Taking the average of the same hour over the 4 days, but adjust by a trend factor.\n\n   How to compute the trend factor?\n\n        We can compute the overall average of each day:\n            Day1: average of 24 hours = ?\n            Day2: ?\n            Day3: ?\n            Day4: ?\n\n        Then fit a linear regression: day index (1,2,3,4) vs daily average to get a slope.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (day5,6,7,8), we project the daily average using the linear trend.\n\n        Then for each hour in day5, we take the average for that hour (from the 4 days) and adjust by the trend (i.e., the projected daily average for day5 minus the average of the daily averages of the 4 days).\n\n        Similarly for day6,7,8.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n        Day1 (2016-10-09): \n            sum = 18.783+19.275+19.064+19.064+17.938+17.587+17.165+16.883+17.094+18.079+18.712+18.431+18.572+20.26+19.908+19.768+19.979+19.838+19.556+18.361+16.461+16.391+16.25+15.687\n            = 18.783+19.275+19.064+19.064+17.938+17.587+17.165+16.883+17.094+18.079+18.712+18.431+18.572+20.26+19.908+19.768+19.979+19.838+19.556+18.361+16.461+16.391+16.25+15.687\n            = 18.783+19.275=38.058;
