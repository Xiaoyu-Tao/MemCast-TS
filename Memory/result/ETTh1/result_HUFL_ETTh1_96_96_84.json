        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-06-02 00:00:00 to 2017-06-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). There might be weekly seasonality too, but we only have 4 days so we focus on daily.\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast might need to account for that in the model.\n 3. We choose a model: Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) is a good candidate.\n\n However, note: We are only given 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 96 points (next 4 days). This is a very short history.\n\n Since we are in an exam setting and without the ability to run code, we must rely on a simple method.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a naive seasonal method: the forecast for each hour is the average of the same hour in the past days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n But note: the data shows:\n   - Daily pattern: lower during the day (negative values in the morning and early afternoon) and higher at night and evening.\n   - However, the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n Given the constraints, we must produce a forecast.\n\n We can try to compute the average pattern for the 4 days and then adjust by the last day's trend? But the data is very short.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (2017-06-05) as the base and adjust by the average change from day to day? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none, we can assume the model we build should be robust.\n\n However, we are not actually running a model. We are to generate the next 96 points.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we might use a simple method:\n\n Method: \n   We will use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? \n   But that would be the same pattern repeated. However, we note that the data does not look stationary.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a linear extrapolation of the last day? \n\n But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n We decide to use a naive seasonal forecast: \n   Let F(t) for t in the next 96 hours, be the value of the same hour from the previous day (i.e., 24 hours before) plus a drift.\n\n However, we don't have a drift. We can compute the average change from day? \n\n Step-by-step for the first hour of the forecast (2017-06-06 00:00:00):\n   It is the same as 2017-06-05 00:00:00? But we see that the pattern is changing.\n\n We can compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days? \n   That would give a constant daily pattern.\n\n But note: the data for 2017-06-05 is different from the previous days? \n\n Let's look at the same hour (00:00:00) for 2017-06-02: 9.310\n for 2017-06-03: 12.458\n for 2017-06-04: 8.908\n for 2017-06-05: 9.846\n\n The average = (9.310 + 12.458 + 8.908 + 9.846) / 4 = 10.1305\n\n Then for every 00:00:00 in the next 4 days, we would forecast 10.1305? But that doesn't account for any trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving window? \n\n Given the short history, we can use the last day (2017-06-05) as the base and then adjust by the average daily change? \n\n How about: \n   Let D_i be the vector of 24 hours for day i (i=1,2,3,4) and we want D_5, D_6, D_7, D_8.\n\n We can model: \n   D_{i} = D_{i-1} + delta   (where delta is the average difference between consecutive days)\n\n But the difference between consecutive days is not constant.\n\n We can compute the average daily change for each hour? \n\n For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we have 3 differences (from day2 to day3, day3 to day4, day4 to day5). Then average that difference and add to the last day to get the next day.\n\n However, we have 3 differences per hour. \n\n Example for hour 00:00:\n   diff1 (day3 - day2) = 12.458 - 9.310 = 3.148\n   diff2 (day4 - day3) = 8.908 - 12.458 = -3.55\n   diff3 (day5 - day4) = 9.846 - 8.908 = 0.938\n   average diff = (3.148 - 3.55 + 0.938) / 3 = (0.536) / 3 = 0.1787\n\n Then the forecast for 2017-06-06 00:00:00 = last value (2017-06-05 00:00:00) + 0.1787 = 9.846 + 0.1787 = 10.0247\n\n Then for 2017-06-07 00:00:00: 10.0247 + 0.1787 = 10.2034\n and so on.\n\n But note: the average change per day for that hour is 0.1787? But we only have 3 differences and they are not consistent.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the overall average change per day? \n\n However, the problem: we are to forecast 4 days. We can do this for each hour.\n\n But note: the data has 24 hours, so we have 24 such series. We can compute the average hourly change for each of the 24 hours.\n\n Steps for each hour h in 0,1,...,23:\n   Let d2 = value at day2, hour h\n        d3 = value at day3, hour h\n        d4 = value at day4, hour h\n        d5 = value at day5, hour h\n\n   Then the differences:\n        diff1 = d3 - d2\n        diff2 = d4 - d3\n        diff3 = d5 - d4\n\n   average_diff = (diff1 + diff2 + diff3) / 3\n\n   Then the forecast for day6, hour h = d5 + average_diff\n   day7, hour h = d5 + 2 * average_diff\n   day8, hour h = d5 + 3 * average_diff\n   day9, hour h = d5 + 4 * average_diff\n\n But wait, we are only forecasting 4 days (96 hours) so we need day6, day7, day8, day9? Actually, from 2017-06-06 to 2017-06-09 is 4 days.\n\n However, note: the last day in the data is 2017-06-05 (day5). So:\n   day6: 2017-06-06\n   day7: 2017-06-07\n   day8: 2017-06-08\n   day9: 2017-06-09\n\n But we only need 4 days? Actually, 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n However, we are starting at 2017-06-06 00:00:00 and going to 2017-06-09 23:00:00.\n\n So we will compute for each hour h:\n   F(day6, h) = d5[h] + average_diff[h]\n   F(day7, h) = d5[h] + 2 * average_diff[h]\n   F(day8, h) = d5[h] + 3 * average_diff[h]\n   F(day9, h) = d5[h] + 4 * average_diff[h]\n\n But wait, that would be 4 steps of the average_diff. However, note that the average_diff is the average daily change. So for day6 we are one day ahead, so we add one average_diff.\n\n However, is this method valid? We are assuming a constant linear trend per hour. \n\n Let's test on a known hour: hour0 (00:00) for day5 is 9.846. The average_diff for hour0 is 0.1787. Then:\n   day6: 9.846 + 0.1787 = 10.0247\n   day7: 9.846 + 2*0.1787 = 10.2034\n   day8: 9.846 + 3*0.1787 = 10.3821\n   day9: 9.846 + 4*0.1787 = 10.5608\n\n But we note that the average_diff was calculated from 3-day differences and we are projecting 4 days into the future. This might be too simplistic.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two differences? But we have only three.\n\n Given the time constraints, we will use this method.\n\n Steps:\n  1. Extract the 4 days of data into a 4x24 matrix (if we had complete days). But note: the data starts at 2017-06-02 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-06-05 23:00:00 -> exactly 96 hours, 4 days.\n\n  2. Reshape the HUFL data into 4 rows (each row a day) and 24 columns (each column an hour).\n\n  3. For each hour (column), compute the differences between consecutive days (so 3 differences) and then the average difference.\n\n  4. For the next 4 days, for each hour, the forecast is:\n        day6: last_day[hour] + 1 * avg_diff[hour]\n        day7: last_day[hour] + 2 * avg_diff[hour]\n        day8: last_day[hour] + 3 * avg_diff[hour]\n        day9: last_day[hour] + 4 * avg_diff[hour]\n\n  5. Then we output the dates from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00 with the forecasted values.\n\n But note: the last day in the data is 2017-06-05 (which we call day5). So the next day is 2017-06-06 (day6).\n\n However, we must be cautious: the average_diff might be negative for some hours.\n\n Let's do the average_diff for each hour:\n\n We'll create a table for the 4 days (each row is a day, each column an hour index 0-23):\n\n Day1 (2017-06-02): [9.310, 8.506, 8.707, 8.372, 6.631, 8.573, 7.569, 6.966, 2.009, -1.942, -2.947, -5.358, -8.439, -8.707, -6.430, -3.684, 0.000, 5.224, 5.961, 7.435, 9.176, 8.841, 11.119, 8.774]\n Day2 (2017-06-03): [12.458, 11.186, 8.306, 11.655, 11.454, 9.176, 6.698, 5.425, 3.550, -3.751, -7.033, -9.377, -12.726, -6.229, -5.358, -5.760, -3.148, 3.684, 5.425, 7.167, 8.573, 8.105, 7.033, 7.636]\n Day3 (2017-06-04): [8.908, 6.698, 7.167, 7.368, 6.698, 8.439, 9.444, 6.966, 0.469, -6.363, -1.072, -11.855, -13.798, -12.726, -10.650, -4.287, 1.942, 7.569, 5.894, 6.363, 7.033, 6.363, 6.363, 7.435]\n Day4 (2017-06-05): [9.846, 8.908, 9.444, 8.707, 8.908, 8.841, 12.525, 9.444, 8.439, 6.296, 6.698, 6.229, 4.957, 6.229, 6.899, 6.162, 6.698, 8.506, 5.894, 5.559, 5.626, 4.890, 6.631, 5.693]\n\n Now, for each hour (column index 0 to 23) we compute the differences:\n\n Hour0 (00:00):\n   diff1 = Day2[0] - Day1[0] = 12.458 - 9.310 = 3.148\n   diff2 = Day3[0] - Day2[0] = 8.908 - 12.458 = -3.55\n   diff3 = Day4[0] - Day3[0] = 9.846 - 8.908 = 0.938\n   avg_diff0 = (3.148 - 3.55 + 0.938) / 3 = (0.148+0.938) = 1.086? Actually: 3.148 - 3.55 = -0.402; -0.402+0.938=0.536; 0.536/3 = 0.178666...\n\n Similarly, we do for all hours.\n\n However, note: we are using 3 differences to compute the average.\n\n We'll compute the average_diff for each hour and then the forecast.\n\n But note: the forecast for the next 4 days for hour0:\n   day6: 9.846 + 0.1787 = 10.0247\n   day7: 9.846 + 2*0.1787 = 10.2034\n   day8: 9.846 + 3*0.1787 = 10.3821\n   day9: 9.846 + 4*0.1787 = 10.5608\n\n We do the same for every hour.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the average_diff might be very noisy and lead to unrealistic forecasts? \n\n We'll proceed and hope that the average_diff is not too extreme.\n\n Let's do one more hour to see: hour1 (01:00)\n   Day1: 8.506\n   Day2: 11.186 -> diff1 = 11.186 - 8.506 = 2.68\n   Day3: 6.698 -> diff2 = 6.698 - 11.186 = -4.488\n   Day4: 8.908 -> diff3 = 8.908 - 6.698 = 2.21\n   avg_diff1 = (2.68 - 4.488 + 2.21) / 3 = (0.402) / 3 = 0.134\n\n Then:\n   day6: 8.908 + 0.134 = 9.042\n   day7: 8.908 + 2*0.134 = 9.176\n   day8: 8.908 + 3*0.134 = 9.310\n   day9: 8.908 + 4*0.134 = 9.444\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the last day (day4) for hour1 is 8.908? Actually, in the data for day4 (2017-06-05) at 01:00:00 is 8.908? \n   Looking at the data: \n        2017-06-05 01:00:00   8.908 -> that's the first hour of day4? Actually, no: \n        The day4 starts at 00:00:00 -> 9.846, then 01:00:00 -> 8.908.\n\n So we are using the last day's value for each hour.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  We'll create an array for the last day (day4) which is the 24 values of 2017-06-05.\n\n  Then we create an array for the average_diff for each hour (0..23).\n\n  Then for the next 4 days (day6, day7, day8, day9) we compute for each hour h:\n        value = last_day[h] + (day_index) * avg_diff[h]\n\n        where day_index: for day6 -> 1, day7->2, day8->3, day9->4.\n\n  But note: the day6 is the first forecast day, so we add 1 * avg_diff.\n\n  We must generate the dates: \n        start: 2017-06-06 00:00:00, then hourly until 2017-06-09 23:00:00.\n\n  We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n Let's compute the average_diff for each hour:\n\n   We'll denote:\n        day1 = [v0_1, v1_1, ..., v23_1]\n        day2 = [v0_2, ...]\n        day3 = [v0_3, ...]\n        day4 = [v0_4, ...]\n\n   For hour i (0<=i<=23):\n        d1 = day2[i] - day1[i]\n        d2 = day3[i] - day2[i]\n        d3 = day4[i] - day3[i]\n        avg_diff[i] = (d1 + d2 + d3) / 3.0\n\n  Then the last_day = day4 (the 24 values of 2017-06-05)\n\n  Then for the k-th day in the future (k=1,2,3,4) and for hour i:\n        value = last_day[i] + k * avg_diff[i]\n\n  And we output for:\n        k=1: 2017-06-06, hour0 to hour23\n        k=2: 2017-06-07, hour0 to hour23\n        k=3: 2017-06-08, hour0 to hour23\n        k=4: 2017-06-09, hour0 to hour23\n\n Now, we code this in our mind and write the forecast.\n\n However, note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days (96 hours).
