        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be cautious. Since the problem states that the data will have missing values, we should consider that the provided data might have gaps? \n    But looking at the provided data, the timestamps are consecutive and without gaps. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00).\n\n 3. Given the nature of the data (hourly, and showing fluctuations), we can use a time series model. Since the data is relatively short (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points ahead, \n    we might consider models that can capture seasonality and trends. However, note that the data only spans 4 days, so we don't have a long history of seasonality (like weekly, monthly).\n\n 4. The data shows a daily pattern? Let's observe:\n    - The values are negative most of the time, with some positive spikes.\n    - There seems to be a daily cycle: for example, on 2017-01-09, the values are relatively high (less negative) at the beginning of the day (00:00 to 01:00) and then become more negative during the day, \n      and then again less negative at the end (22:00 and 23:00). But the pattern is not very clear.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we are to forecast 4 days, we can use a model that uses the daily pattern. One simple approach is to use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data does not have a full week, so we cannot use weekly seasonality. We have 4 days of data, so we can compute the average for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days.\n\n    But wait: the data starts on 2017-01-09 (Monday) and ends on 2017-01-12 (Thursday). The next 4 days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? \n    However, we don't have weekend data to compare. So the daily pattern might be the best we can do.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. But with only 96 points and the need to forecast 96 points, we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, I propose:\n    - We will use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for forecasting:\n      For hour h (where h in [0,23]), we have 4 observations: from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n      We compute the average for that hour and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the next 4 days are 4 different days of the week. But without knowing the weekly pattern, we assume that the daily pattern is consistent.\n\n 8. But let's check: the data we have is for 4 consecutive days (Monday to Thursday). The next 4 days are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. \n    We don't have weekend data, so we cannot adjust for weekend effect. Therefore, we will use the same daily pattern for all days.\n\n 9. How to handle if there are missing values in the provided data? The provided data does not have missing values, but if in the future we had to handle missing values, we would impute them. \n    However, the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we proceed.\n\n 10. Implementation:\n      - Group the data by hour (i.e., the time of day: 0,1,...,23)\n      - For each hour, compute the mean of the MULL values for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n      Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-01-13 00:00:00), we assign:\n          Day 1 (2017-01-13, Friday): use the average for hour 0,1,...,23\n          Day 2 (2017-01-14, Saturday): same averages (since we don't have weekend data, we use the same pattern)\n          Day 3 (2017-01-15, Sunday): same\n          Day 4 (2017-01-16, Monday): same\n\n 11. However, note that the next Monday (2017-01-16) might be similar to the previous Monday (2017-01-09) but we don't have a full week to compare. \n     So we stick to the average of the 4 days we have.\n\n 12. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We have 4 days, each with 24 hours -> 4 values per hour.\n\n      Example for hour 00:00:\n        2017-01-09 00:00:00  0.036\n        2017-01-10 00:00:00  0.533\n        2017-01-11 00:00:00  0.391\n        2017-01-12 00:00:00 -0.746\n        Average = (0.036 + 0.533 + 0.391 - 0.746) / 4 = (0.214) / 4 = 0.0535\n\n      Similarly for other hours.\n\n 13. We will compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then replicate that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not been given any in the provided 96, but if we were, we would have to impute. \n     However, the provided data is complete. So we proceed.\n\n 15. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2017-01-13 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-01-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n 16. We then assign:\n       2017-01-13 00:00:00: value = average of hour0\n       2017-01-13 01:00:00: value = average of hour1\n       ... and so on.\n\n 17. We must output the complete 96 forecasted points in the required format.\n\n 18. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the 4 values for that hour.\n\n      Hour 0 (00:00): [0.036, 0.533, 0.391, -0.746] -> (0.036+0.533+0.391-0.746)/4 = (0.214)/4 = 0.0535\n      Hour 1 (01:00): [0.249, 0.320, 0.284, -0.924] -> (0.249+0.320+0.284-0.924)/4 = (-0.071)/4 = -0.01775\n      Hour 2 (02:00): [-0.782, -0.391, 0.178, 0.533] -> (-0.782-0.391+0.178+0.533)/4 = (-0.462)/4 = -0.1155\n      Hour 3 (03:00): [0.000, -0.391, 0.071, 0.391] -> (0.000-0.391+0.071+0.391)/4 = (0.071)/4 = 0.01775\n      Hour 4 (04:00): [-0.569, -0.426, -0.213, 0.107] -> (-0.569-0.426-0.213+0.107)/4 = (-1.101)/4 = -0.27525\n      Hour 5 (05:00): [-1.066, -1.102, 0.000, -0.426] -> (-1.066-1.102+0.000-0.426)/4 = (-2.594)/4 = -0.6485\n      Hour 6 (06:00): [0.249, -0.995, -0.959, -0.284] -> (0.249-0.995-0.959-0.284)/4 = (-1.989)/4 = -0.49725\n      Hour 7 (07:00): [-0.640, -1.066, -1.066, -0.320] -> (-0.640-1.066-1.066-0.320)/4 = (-3.092)/4 = -0.773\n      Hour 8 (08:00): [-0.036, -1.812, -1.528, -0.071] -> (-0.036-1.812-1.528-0.071)/4 = (-3.447)/4 = -0.86175\n      Hour 9 (09:00): [-0.213, -1.244, -0.462, -0.746] -> (-0.213-1.244-0.462-0.746)/4 = (-2.665)/4 = -0.66625\n      Hour 10 (10:00): [-1.279, -1.173, -1.315, -0.391] -> (-1.279-1.173-1.315-0.391)/4 = (-4.158)/4 = -1.0395\n      Hour 11 (11:00): [-0.853, -1.492, -0.853, -0.640] -> (-0.853-1.492-0.853-0.640)/4 = (-3.838)/4 = -0.9595\n      Hour 12 (12:00): [-1.954, -1.741, -2.310, -1.919] -> (-1.954-1.741-2.310-1.919)/4 = (-7.924)/4 = -1.981\n      Hour 13 (13:00): [-0.888, -1.350, -1.421, -0.817] -> (-0.888-1.350-1.421-0.817)/4 = (-4.476)/4 = -1.119\n      Hour 14 (14:00): [-0.462, -1.599, -0.959, -0.533] -> (-0.462-1.599-0.959-0.533)/4 = (-3.553)/4 = -0.88825\n      Hour 15 (15:00): [-0.675, -1.137, -1.066, -2.345] -> (-0.675-1.137-1.066-2.345)/4 = (-5.223)/4 = -1.30575\n      Hour 16 (16:00): [-1.848, -1.208, -1.741, -1.421] -> (-1.848-1.208-1.741-1.421)/4 = (-6.218)/4 = -1.5545\n      Hour 17 (17:00): [-1.102, -1.812, -1.492, -1.741] -> (-1.102-1.812-1.492-1.741)/4 = (-6.147)/4 = -1.53675\n      Hour 18 (18:00): [-1.279, -1.919, -1.812, -1.883] -> (-1.279-1.919-1.812-1.883)/4 = (-6.893)/4 = -1.72325\n      Hour 19 (19:00): [-1.279, -2.025, -1.492, -2.025] -> (-1.279-2.025-1.492-2.025)/4 = (-6.821)/4 = -1.70525\n      Hour 20 (20:00): [-1.279, -1.812, -1.919, -2.132] -> (-1.279-1.812-1.919-2.132)/4 = (-7.142)/4 = -1.7855\n      Hour 21 (21:00): [-1.279, -2.594, -3.127, -2.523] -> (-1.279-2.594-3.127-2.523)/4 = (-9.523)/4 = -2.38075\n      Hour 22 (22:00): [0.355, -0.817, -1.706, -1.635] -> (0.355-0.817-1.706-1.635)/4 = (-3.803)/4 = -0.95075\n      Hour 23 (23:00): [-1.244, -0.959, -0.888, -0.071] -> (-1.244-0.959-0.888-0.071)/4 = (-3.162)/4 = -0.7905\n\n 19. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-01-13 (Friday) -> hours 0 to 23: [0.0535, -0.01775, -0.1155, 0.01775, -0.27525, -0.6485, -0.49725, -0.773, -0.86175, -0.66625, -1.0395, -0.9595, -1.981, -1.119, -0.88825, -1.30575, -1.5545, -1.53675, -1.72325, -1.70525, -1.7855, -2.38075, -0.95075, -0.7905]\n\n      Day 2: 2017-01-14 (Saturday) -> same pattern: same 24 values as above.\n\n      Day 3: 2017-01-15 (Sunday) -> same pattern.\n\n      Day 4: 2017-01-16 (Monday) -> same pattern.\n\n 20. We output the data in the exact format, with the timestamp and the MULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 21. Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-13 00:00:00  0.054\n2017-01-13 01:00:00 -0.018\n2017-01-13 02:00:00 -0.116\n... and so on\n\n```\n\n 22. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places. Note: the input had 3 decimal places.\n\n 23. Let's write the computed averages rounded to 3 decimal places:\n\n      Hour0: 0.0535 -> 0.054\n      Hour1: -0.01775 -> -0.018\n      Hour2: -0.1155 -> -0.116\n      Hour3: 0.01775 -> 0.018\n      Hour4: -0.27525 -> -0.275\n      Hour5: -0.6485 -> -0.648\n      Hour6: -0.49725 -> -0.497\n      Hour7: -0.773 -> -0.773\n      Hour8: -0.86175 -> -0.862\n      Hour9: -0.66625 -> -0.666\n      Hour10: -1.0395 -> -1.040\n      Hour11: -0.9595 -> -0.960\n      Hour12: -1.981 -> -1.981\n      Hour13: -1.119 -> -1.119\n      Hour14: -0.88825 -> -0.888\n      Hour15: -1.30575 -> -1.306\n      Hour16: -1.5545 -> -1.555\n      Hour17: -1.53675 -> -1.537\n      Hour18: -1.72325 -> -1.723\n      Hour19: -1.70525 -> -1.705\n      Hour20: -1.7855 -> -1.786\n      Hour21: -2.38075 -> -2.381\n      Hour22: -0.95075 -> -0.951\n      Hour23: -0.7905 -> -0.791\n\n 24. Now, we generate the next 96 timestamps and assign the values in the pattern above for 4 days.\n\n 25. Code for generating the timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2017-01-13 00:00:00\n      Then add 1 hour until we have 96 points.\n\n 26. We write the output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-13 00:00:00  0.054\n2017-01-13 01:00:00 -0.018\n2017-01-13 02:00:00 -0.116\n2017-01-13 03:00:00  0.018\n2017-01-13 04:00:00 -0.275\n2017-01-13 05:00:00 -0.648\n2017-01-13 06:00:00 -0.497\n2017-01-13 07:00:00 -0.773\n2017-01-13 08:00:00 -0.862\n2017-01-13 09:00:00 -0.666\n2017-01-13 10:00:00 -1.040\n2017-01-13 11:00:00 -0.960\n2017-01-13 12:00:00 -1.981\n2017-01-13 13:00:00 -1.119\n2017-01-13 14:00:00 -0.888\n2017-01-13 15:00:00 -1.306\n2017-01-13 16:00:00 -1.555\n2017-01-13 17:00:00 -1.537\n2017-01-13 18:00:00 -1.723\n2017-01-13 19:00:00 -1.705\n2017-01-13 20:00:00 -1.786\n2017-01-13 21:00:00 -2.381\n2017-01-13 22:00:00 -0.951\n2017-01-13 23:00:00 -0.791\n2017-01-14 00:00:00  0.054\n2017-01-14 01:00:00 -0.018\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n```\n\n 27. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 28. We do the same pattern for 4 days.\n\n 29. Let's write the complete output.\n\n Note: We are rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, note that the input had negative zero (like -0.000) but we don't have that in our averages.
