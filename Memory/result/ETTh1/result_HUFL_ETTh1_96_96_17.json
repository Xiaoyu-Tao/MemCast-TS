        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we are to be cautious for the forecast period.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 hours, which would be from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality.\n The data shows daily patterns (24-hour cycle). We can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) which is a very short history. This makes it challenging to capture weekly patterns (if any) but we don't have a week of data. So we focus on daily seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - SARIMA: We'll try to fit a model with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n\n But note: 4 days of data is very short for fitting a seasonal model with 24 periods. We might have to use a simpler model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: \n   - Use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated method.\n\n Considering the short history, we can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with a daily seasonality (if we can set the seasonality to 24) but ETS typically requires at least two full seasons (so 48 points) which we have. We have 4*24=96, so 4 seasons.\n\n We can also consider using a simple moving average or even a linear model with time and hour-of-day as features.\n\n But note: the requirement is to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, and we must not omit any.\n\n Since the data is short, we are going to use a simple average by hour of day for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the method:\n   - Extract the hour of the day from the timestamp.\n   - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average HUFL over the 4 available days (if there are missing values we would have to handle, but in the given data there are none).\n   - Then, for the next 96 hours (which are 4 days: 2016-09-11 to 2016-09-14), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n However, this method ignores any trend and only captures the daily pattern. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (8.105 + 10.382 + 11.989 + 10.181) / 4 = (8.105+10.382+11.989+10.181)=40.657 -> 10.16425\n   hour1: (8.172+11.052+12.726+10.918) = 42.868 -> 10.717\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Looking at the first 4 days, the values at the same hour are not constant. However, without more data, we cannot reliably estimate a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-09-10) as the base and adjust by the average hourly pattern? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n Given the challenge, we'll use the average by hour for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided history, there are none. For the forecast, we are to provide 96 values without missing. So we just output the 96 forecasted values.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". It might refer to the provided history? But in the given 96 points, there are no missing. So we proceed.\n\n Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then take the mean.\n\n Steps:\n   - Group the data by hour (the hour part of the time).\n   - For each hour, we have 4 values (from 4 days). We take the mean.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (from 2016-09-11 to 2016-09-14), we assign:\n   Day 1 (2016-09-11): hour0, hour1, ... hour23 -> using the computed mean for hour0, hour1, ... hour23.\n   Day 2 (2016-09-12): same as day1? Actually, we are using the same hourly pattern for each day.\n\n But note: the pattern might change over the week? We don't have weekly data (only 4 days, which are from Wednesday to Saturday). The next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n   - 2016-09-07: Wednesday\n   - 2016-09-08: Thursday\n   - 2016-09-09: Friday\n   - 2016-09-10: Saturday\n   - Then next:\n        2016-09-11: Sunday\n        2016-09-12: Monday\n        2016-09-13: Tuesday\n        2016-09-14: Wednesday\n\n We don't have data for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (in the history we have Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). So we cannot compute an average for Sunday, Monday, etc. separately.\n\n Therefore, we have to use the same daily pattern for all days? Or we can assume that the pattern is the same every day? \n\n Given the data, we have no choice but to use the same daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n So we compute the average_hour[i] for i in 0..23 from the 4 days we have.\n\n Then, for the next 96 hours, we generate:\n\n  2016-09-11 00:00:00: average_hour[0]\n  2016-09-11 01:00:00: average_hour[1]\n  ...\n  2016-09-11 23:00:00: average_hour[23]\n  2016-09-12 00:00:00: average_hour[0]\n  ... and so on.\n\n This is simple and we have 4 days of history to average.\n\n Let's compute the averages:\n\n We'll create a dictionary or list for the hours.\n\n But note: the data provided is exactly 96 rows, 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n We can reshape the HUFL column into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the days.\n\n Steps:\n\n   import numpy as np   [But note: we are not allowed to use code? We are to provide the answer. So we do the computation manually?]\n\n Alternatively, we can compute by hand. But that is tedious. Since we are an AI, we can compute internally.\n\n However, the problem requires the complete data. We must output 96 rows.\n\n We'll compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour0: [8.105, 10.382, 11.989, 10.181] -> mean = (8.105+10.382+11.989+10.181)/4 = 40.657/4 = 10.16425\n   hour1: [8.172, 11.052, 12.726, 10.918] -> 42.868/4 = 10.717\n   hour2: [8.372, 10.114, 12.659, 11.119] -> (8.372+10.114+12.659+11.119)=42.264 -> 10.566\n   hour3: [6.631, 10.248, 12.458, 10.784] -> (6.631+10.248+12.458+10.784)=40.121 -> 10.03025\n   hour4: [8.105, 10.449, 12.190, 10.717] -> (8.105+10.449+12.190+10.717)=41.461 -> 10.36525\n   hour5: [9.377, 10.047, 11.721, 10.315] -> (9.377+10.047+11.721+10.315)=41.46 -> 10.365\n   hour6: [10.717, 12.860, 12.659, 10.717] -> (10.717+12.860+12.659+10.717)=46.953 -> 11.73825\n   hour7: [10.315, 11.655, 10.315, 9.913] -> (10.315+11.655+10.315+9.913)=42.198 -> 10.5495\n   hour8: [9.310, 8.239, 11.052, 10.918] -> (9.310+8.239+11.052+10.918)=39.519 -> 9.87975\n   hour9: [8.372, 8.038, 9.377, 9.042] -> (8.372+8.038+9.377+9.042)=34.829 -> 8.70725\n   hour10: [9.042, 8.975, 9.913, 9.980] -> (9.042+8.975+9.913+9.980)=37.91 -> 9.4775\n   hour11: [8.105, 9.176, 9.176, 10.315] -> (8.105+9.176+9.176+10.315)=36.772 -> 9.193\n   hour12: [5.961, 7.368, 7.234, 7.971] -> Let me check: \n        Day1: 5.961, Day2:7.368, Day3:7.234, Day4:7.971 -> (5.961+7.368+7.234+7.971)=28.534 -> 7.1335\n   hour13: [6.028, 6.363, 7.837, 7.837] -> (6.028+6.363+7.837+7.837)=28.065 -> 7.01625\n   hour14: [6.899, 7.569, 8.774, 7.837] -> (6.899+7.569+8.774+7.837)=31.079 -> 7.76975\n   hour15: [6.966, 6.765, 8.774, 8.306] -> (6.966+6.765+8.774+8.306)=30.811 -> 7.70275\n   hour16: [6.698, 6.899, 8.439, 7.301] -> (6.698+6.899+8.439+7.301)=29.337 -> 7.33425\n   hour17: [7.234, 7.569, 8.841, 8.841] -> (7.234+7.569+8.841+8.841)=32.485 -> 8.12125\n   hour18: [6.631, 6.832, 7.703, 7.569] -> (6.631+6.832+7.703+7.569)=28.735 -> 7.18375\n   hour19: [6.631, 7.368, 8.439, 8.239] -> (6.631+7.368+8.439+8.239)=30.677 -> 7.66925\n   hour20: [6.497, 7.368, 7.904, 7.636] -> (6.497+7.368+7.904+7.636)=29.405 -> 7.35125\n   hour21: [6.497, 8.707, 7.368, 9.176] -> (6.497+8.707+7.368+9.176)=31.748 -> 7.937\n   hour22: [5.224, 10.047, 9.645, 11.119] -> (5.224+10.047+9.645+11.119)=36.035 -> 9.00875\n   hour23: [7.100, 10.918, 10.382, 13.128] -> (7.100+10.918+10.382+13.128)=41.528 -> 10.382\n\n Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2016-09-11 00:00:00 (which is a Sunday) -> hour0: 10.16425\n   Then 2016-09-11 01:00:00: 10.717\n   ... until 2016-09-11 23:00:00: 10.382\n\n   Then 2016-09-12 00:00:00: 10.16425\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll generate 4 days of these 24 average values.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are generating without missing.\n\n We are to provide the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL'\n\n We must output 96 rows.\n\n Let's write the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-09-11 00:00:00\n   End: 2016-09-14 23:00:00\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00, hourly.\n\n We have 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n Now, we assign the HUFL values by the hour of the day.\n\n We have a list of 24 average values:\n\n   [10.16425, 10.717, 10.566, 10.03025, 10.36525, 10.365, 11.73825, 10.5495, 9.87975, 8.70725, 9.4775, 9.193, 7.1335, 7.01625, 7.76975, 7.70275, 7.33425, 8.12125, 7.18375, 7.66925, 7.35125, 7.937, 9.00875, 10.382]\n\n We'll round to 3 decimal places?

You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll write 96 rows.\n\n However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places. We rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n But let's check the computed averages: we did the division and then rounded to 3 decimals? Actually, we should round to 3 decimals after the division.\n\n We did:\n\n   hour0: 40.657/4 = 10.16425 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 10.164\n   hour1: 42.868/4 = 10.717 -> exactly 10.717\n\n   We'll use 3 decimal representation.\n\n But note: the input had 3 decimals, but the numbers we computed might have more. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the precision. We'll use 3 decimals as in the input.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n   We have 4 days: 2016-09-11, 2016-09-12, 2016-09-13, 2016-09-14.\n\n   For each day, we assign the 24 values in order.\n\n   So the HUFL values for the 4 days will be the same 24 numbers repeated 4 times.\n\n We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n               date   HUFL\n2016-09-11 00:00:00 10.164\n2016-09-11 01:00:00 10.717\n2016-09-11 02:00:00 10.566\n2016-09-11 03:00:00 10.030\n2016-09-11 04:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-11 05:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-11 06:00:00 11.738\n2016-09-11 07:00:00 10.550\n2016-09-11 08:00:00  9.880\n2016-09-11 09:00:00  8.707\n2016-09-11 10:00:00  9.478\n2016-09-11 11:00:00  9.193\n2016-09-11 12:00:00  7.134\n2016-09-11 13:00:00  7.016\n2016-09-11 14:00:00  7.770\n2016-09-11 15:00:00  7.703\n2016-09-11 16:00:00  7.334\n2016-09-11 17:00:00  8.121\n2016-09-11 18:00:00  7.184\n2016-09-11 19:00:00  7.669\n2016-09-11 20:00:00  7.351\n2016-09-11 21:00:00  7.937\n2016-09-11 22:00:00  9.009\n2016-09-11 23:00:00 10.382\n2016-09-12 00:00:00 10.164\n2016-09-12 01:00:00 10.717\n2016-09-12 02:00:00 10.566\n2016-09-12 03:00:00 10.030\n2016-09-12 04:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-12 05:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-12 06:00:00 11.738\n2016-09-12 07:00:00 10.550\n2016-09-12 08:00:00  9.880\n2016-09-12 09:00:00  8.707\n2016-09-12 10:00:00  9.478\n2016-09-12 11:00:00  9.193\n2016-09-12 12:00:00  7.134\n2016-09-12 13:00:00  7.016\n2016-09-12 14:00:00  7.770\n2016-09-12 15:00:00  7.703\n2016-09-12 16:00:00  7.334\n2016-09-12 17:00:00  8.121\n2016-09-12 18:00:00  7.184\n2016-09-12 19:00:00  7.669\n2016-09-12 20:00:00  7.351\n2016-09-12 21:00:00  7.937\n2016-09-12 22:00:00  9.009\n2016-09-12 23:00:00 10.382\n2016-09-13 00:00:00 10.164\n2016-09-13 01:00:00 10.717\n2016-09-13 02:00:00 10.566\n2016-09-13 03:00:00 10.030\n2016-09-13 04:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-13 05:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-13 06:00:00 11.738\n2016-09-13 07:00:00 10.550\n2016-09-13 08:00:00  9.880\n2016-09-13 09:00:00  8.707\n2016-09-13 10:00:00  9.478\n2016-09-13 11:00:00  9.193\n2016-09-13 12:00:00  7.134\n2016-09-13 13:00:00  7.016\n2016-09-13 14:00:00  7.770\n2016-09-13 15:00:00  7.703\n2016-09-13 16:00:00  7.334\n2016-09-13 17:00:00  8.121\n2016-09-13 18:00:00  7.184\n2016-09-13 19:00:00  7.669\n2016-09-13 20:00:00  7.351\n2016-09-13 21:00:00  7.937\n2016-09-13 22:00:00  9.009\n2016-09-13 23:00:00 10.382\n2016-09-14 00:00:00 10.164\n2016-09-14 01:00:00 10.717\n2016-09-14 02:00:00 10.566\n2016-09-14 03:00:00 10.030\n2016-09-14 04:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-14 05:00:00 10.365\n2016-09-14 06:00:00 11.738\n2016-09-14 07:00:00 10.550\n2016-09-14 08:00:00  9.880\n2016-09-14 09:00:00  8.707\n2016-09-14 10:00:00  9.478\n2016-09-14 11:00:00  9.193\n2016-09-14 12:00:00  7.134\n2016-09-14 13:00:00  7.016\n2016-09-14 14:00:00  7.770\n2016-09-14 15:00:00  7.703\n2016-09-14 16:00:00  7.334\n2016-09-14 17:00:00  8.121\n2016-09-14 18:00:00  7.184\n2016-09-14 19:00:00  7.669\n2016-09-14 20:00:00  7.351\n2016-09-14 21:00:00  7.937\n2016-09-14 22:00:00  9.009\n2016-09-14 23:00:00 10.382\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n However, note: the input had the HUFL column aligned with the date. We have done that.\n\n But wait: the input had the HUFL value for 2016-09-10 23:00:00 as 13.128, and we are forecasting 10.382 for the same hour in the next days? \n   - That's because we are averaging the 4 days. The 23rd hour in the history: \n        Day1: 7.100, Day2: 10.918, Day3: 10.382, Day4: 13.128 -> average 10.382.\n\n This is the method we chose.\n\n We are aware that this is a simple method, but with only 4 days of history, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's output the data.\n",
