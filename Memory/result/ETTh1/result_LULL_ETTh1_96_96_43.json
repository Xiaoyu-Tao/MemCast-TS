        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values.\n    However, the provided data for the past 96 points is complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the future? \n    But the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided past data might have missing values? \n    But in the given data, there are 96 consecutive hours without gaps. So we assume the past data is complete for now.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we are limited in model complexity.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality. However, we note that the data has multiple seasons? \n    But with only 4 days, we can only capture daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 5. We will use a seasonal naive method? But that might be too simple. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonal components.\n\n 6. However, note: the data has a pattern that repeats every 24 hours? Let's check the data:\n\n    Day 1: 2016-12-20: \n        00:00: 1.249, 01:00: 1.279, ... 23:00: 0.914\n    Day 2: 2016-12-21: \n        00:00: 0.822, ... 23:00: 0.609\n    Day 3: 2016-12-22: \n        00:00: 0.701, ... 23:00: 0.579\n    Day 4: 2016-12-23: \n        00:00: 0.670, ... 23:00: 1.127\n\n    The pattern is not exactly the same but there is a general daily cycle.\n\n 7. We are to forecast the next 4 days (from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00).\n\n 8. We can use a model that uses the last available cycle and adjust by the trend? But the trend is not clear.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we are going to use a simple method: \n    - We will compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 4 days.\n\n    Steps for the model:\n    a) Extract the daily seasonality (24 points) by averaging each hour of the day over the 4 days.\n    b) Check if there is a trend? We can compute the average level of each day and see if it is increasing or decreasing.\n\n    Let's compute the daily average:\n        Day1 (2016-12-20): average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        Day2: ...\n        Day3: ...\n        Day4: ...\n\n    Then, we can compute the trend from these daily averages.\n\n    However, note: we only have 4 days, so the trend might be unreliable.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-23) as the base and then adjust by the average change from one day to the next? \n\n 11. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. Since the past data is complete, we don't need to impute for the past. \n     but for the future, we are to generate 96 points without missing values.\n\n 12. We decide to use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour. That is, for hour h (0 to 23) in the next day, we take the average of the same hour in the past 4 days.\n\n     Example for 00:00: \n        Day1: 1.249, Day2: 0.822, Day3: 0.701, Day4: 0.670 -> average = (1.249+0.822+0.701+0.670)/4 = 0.8605\n\n     Then we do this for each hour.\n\n 13. However, this method ignores any trend. We see that the daily average has been decreasing? \n\n        Day1: average = (1.249+1.279+...+0.914)/24 -> let's compute quickly:\n            We can approximate: the numbers are around 0.7 to 1.3, but let me compute:\n\n        Actually, we can compute the daily average:\n\n        Day1 (2016-12-20): \n            values: [1.249,1.279,1.279,1.157,1.157,1.218,1.097,1.249,0.883,0.883,0.975,0.883,0.853,1.036,1.005,1.005,0.883,0.944,0.822,0.761,0.761,0.914,0.914,0.914]\n            sum = 24.???\n            Let me calculate: \n                1.249+1.279+1.279+1.157+1.157+1.218+1.097+1.249 = 9.685\n                0.883+0.883+0.975+0.883+0.853+1.036+1.005+1.005 = 7.524\n                0.883+0.944+0.822+0.761+0.761+0.914+0.914+0.914 = 6.913\n                Total = 9.685+7.524+6.913 = 24.122\n                Average = 24.122/24 = 1.005083\n\n        Day2 (2016-12-21):\n            [0.822,0.761,0.640,0.701,0.579,1.249,1.279,1.340,0.883,0.883,0.944,0.944,1.005,1.127,1.127,1.218,0.914,0.731,0.640,0.609,0.579,0.579,0.792,0.609]\n            Let me group: \n                0.822+0.761+0.640+0.701+0.579+1.249+1.279+1.340 = 7.371\n                0.883+0.883+0.944+0.944+1.005+1.127+1.127+1.218 = 8.131\n                0.914+0.731+0.640+0.609+0.579+0.579+0.792+0.609 = 5.453\n                Total = 7.371+8.131+5.453 = 20.955\n                Average = 20.955/24 = 0.873125\n\n        Day3 (2016-12-22):\n            [0.701,0.701,0.701,0.670,0.670,0.609,0.731,0.731,0.701,0.822,0.761,0.883,0.670,0.944,1.157,0.944,0.853,0.731,0.701,0.731,0.670,0.670,0.548,0.579]\n            Group:\n                0.701*3 + 0.670*2 + 0.609 + 0.731*2 + 0.701 + 0.822+0.761+0.883 = \n                2.103 + 1.34 + 0.609 + 1.462 + 0.701 + 0.822+0.761+0.883 = 9.681\n                0.670+0.944+1.157+0.944+0.853+0.731+0.701+0.731+0.670+0.670+0.548+0.579 -> actually we have 12 values? \n                Actually, we have 24 values. Let me recalc by the list:\n                Sum = 0.701+0.701+0.701+0.670+0.670+0.609+0.731+0.731+0.701+0.822+0.761+0.883+0.670+0.944+1.157+0.944+0.853+0.731+0.701+0.731+0.670+0.670+0.548+0.579\n                = 17.504\n                Average = 17.504/24 = 0.729333\n\n        Day4 (2016-12-23):\n            [0.670,0.609,0.609,0.579,0.609,0.579,0.609,0.670,1.005,1.066,1.188,1.097,1.036,1.036,1.249,1.310,1.279,0.853,0.731,0.670,0.731,0.822,0.579,1.127]\n            Sum = 0.670+0.609+0.609+0.579+0.609+0.579+0.609+0.670 = 4.934\n                1.005+1.066+1.188+1.097+1.036+1.036+1.249+1.310 = 9.987\n                1.279+0.853+0.731+0.670+0.731+0.822+0.579+1.127 = 6.792\n                Total = 4.934+9.987+6.792 = 21.713\n                Average = 21.713/24 = 0.904708\n\n        The daily averages: [1.005083, 0.873125, 0.729333, 0.904708] -> There is a dip on day3 and then a rise on day4. \n\n 14. We can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form the daily pattern, and then adjust by the overall level? \n     But the level is not consistent. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and then use the average daily pattern? \n\n 15. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, and then adjust by the trend of the daily averages? \n     We have 4 daily averages: d1, d2, d3, d4. \n        d1=1.005, d2=0.873, d3=0.729, d4=0.905\n\n     The trend: we can fit a linear regression on the daily averages? \n        x = [1,2,3,4] (days), y = [1.005, 0.873, 0.729, 0.905]\n        slope = ? \n\n        But note: the trend is not linear: it went down then up.\n\n 16. Given the complexity and the small data, we might use the average of the last 4 days for each hour without trend adjustment.\n\n 17. However, note that the last day (day4) has a higher average than day2 and day3. It might be that the load is increasing again? \n     We can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? \n\n 18. We decide to use a weighted average: \n        weight for day1: 1, day2: 1, day3: 2, day4: 3? \n        But we have no strong reason.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing for the daily pattern? \n\n 20. Given the time and simplicity, we will use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. \n\n 21. Steps:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the day:\n            value_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n        Then we use this pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 22. But note: the next 4 days might have a different level? We can adjust the level by the last day's average? \n        Let the base level of the forecast be the average of the last day (day4) = 0.9047.\n        The base level of the historical daily pattern (computed by the 4-day average for each hour) is the average of the 4 daily averages? \n            base_hist = (1.005+0.873+0.729+0.905)/4 = 0.878\n\n        Then we can scale the forecasted pattern by: (0.9047 / 0.878) * pattern_h\n\n     However, this might be overcomplicating.\n\n 23. We'll go with the scaling.\n\n 24. How to compute the base level of the pattern? \n        We have a pattern of 24 values: [p0, p1, ... p23] = [ (d1_0+d2_0+d3_0+d4_0)/4, ... ]\n        The average of this pattern is the same as the average of the daily averages? \n            Because: \n                (p0+p1+...+p23)/24 = ( (d1_0+...+d4_0)/4 + ... ) /24 \n                = ( (d1_0+...+d1_23) + (d4_0+...+d4_23) ) / (4*24) \n                = (sum_day1 + sum_day2 + sum_day3 + sum_day4) / (4*24)\n                = (24*d1_avg + 24*d2_avg + 24*d4_avg) / (4*24) = (d1_avg+d2_avg+d3_avg+d4_avg)/4 = base_hist\n\n        So base_hist = 0.878\n\n        Then the scaling factor = last_day_avg / base_hist = 0.9047 / 0.878 = 1.0304\n\n 25. Then the forecast for hour h: \n        forecast_h = ( (d1_h + d2_h + d3_h + d4_h) / 4 ) * (0.9047 / 0.878)\n\n 26. But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We assume the same pattern repeats for each day? \n\n 27. However, we see that the daily average has been changing. We might also adjust the level for each forecasted day? \n        We can use the trend of the daily averages? \n\n        We have daily averages: [1.005, 0.873, 0.729, 0.905] for days 1,2,3,4.\n\n        We can fit a linear model: \n            x = [1,2,3,4], y = [1.005, 0.873, 0.729, 0.905]\n\n        Let's compute the slope (b) and intercept (a) for y = a + b*x\n\n        n=4\n        sum_x = 10, sum_y = 3.512, sum_xy = 1*1.005 + 2*0.873 + 3*0.729 + 4*0.905 = 1.005+1.746+2.187+3.62 = 8.558\n        sum_x2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n        b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n          = (4*8.558 - 10*3.512) / (4*30 - 100)\n          = (34.232 - 35.12) / (120-100)\n          = (-0.888) / 20 = -0.0444\n\n        a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (3.512 - (-0.0444)*10) / 4 = (3.512+0.444)/4 = 3.956/4 = 0.989\n\n        Then the forecast for day5 (x=5): y5 = 0.989 -0.0444*5 = 0.989 - 0.222 = 0.767\n        day6 (x=6): 0.989 -0.0444*6 = 0.989-0.2664 = 0.7226\n        day7 (x=7): 0.989-0.0444*7 = 0.989-0.3108 = 0.6782\n        day8 (x=8): 0.989-0.0444*8 = 0.989-0.3552 = 0.6338\n\n        But note: the last day (day4) was 0.905 and the model predicts a decreasing trend? However, the last point (day4) was 0.905 and the model predicted for day4: \n            y4 = 0.989 -0.0444*4 = 0.989-0.1776 = 0.8114, but the actual was 0.905 -> so the linear model is not fitting well.\n\n 28. Given the poor fit of the linear model and the fact that we have only 4 points, we might avoid using the linear trend and instead use the last known daily average (0.905) for the next day, \n     and then assume a constant level? \n\n 29. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? (day3 and day4): (0.729+0.905)/2 = 0.817, but that is lower than day4.\n\n 30. We are going to use the following:\n\n        For the next 4 days, we will use the same daily pattern (the 24-hour pattern we computed) but scaled to the level of the last day (day4) without trend.\n\n        That is: \n            base_hist = (d1_avg+d2_avg+d3_avg+d4_avg)/4 = 0.878\n            scaling_factor = d4_avg / base_hist = 0.9047 / 0.878 = 1.0304\n\n        Then for each hour h in the day, the base pattern value is: \n            base_pattern_h = (d1_h + d2_h + d3_h + d4_h) /4\n\n        Then the forecast for that hour in any of the next 4 days is: \n            forecast_h = base_pattern_h * scaling_factor\n\n        But note: this will give the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 31. However, the problem does not specify if there is a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly.\n\n 32. We'll generate the base pattern for 24 hours and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 33. Steps to compute the base pattern for 24 hours:\n\n        We have the data for 4 days.
