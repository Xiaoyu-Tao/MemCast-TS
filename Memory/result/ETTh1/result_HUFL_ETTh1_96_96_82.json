        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour periodicity) and also some negative values.\n 2. Given the small amount of data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we need a model that can capture seasonality.\n 3. We are also warned about missing values, but in the provided data there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data has a strong daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the day using the same hour from the last available day.\n   - However, we have 4 days of data. We can also consider using the average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n But note: the last day we have is 2017-05-28. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-05-29 00:00:00 to 2017-06-01 23:00:00.\n\n However, looking at the data, there is a pattern that repeats daily but also some variation. We can try to use the average of the same hour for the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Since we are to provide a complete forecast for 96 points, and we are not given any other variables (like oil temperature) for forecasting, we focus on the HUFL series.\n\n Considering simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can use the following:\n\n Option 1: Use the last available day (2017-05-28) as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? But that would be too simplistic and ignore the trend and variation.\n\n Option 2: Compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and use that for each day in the forecast period.\n\n However, let's look at the data: \n   The values for the same hour across days are not constant. For example, at 00:00:\n        Day1: 8.707\n        Day2: 6.899\n        Day3: 6.497\n        Day4: 10.583\n\n The average for 00:00: (8.707+6.899+6.497+10.583)/4 = 8.1715\n\n But note: the last day (2017-05-28) has a higher value at 00:00. Maybe there is a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the seasonality and a possible trend. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n Given the problem, we choose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 available days.\n   Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this average pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to see weekly. Also, the next 4 days are consecutive days.\n\n However, we must consider that the next 4 days might be similar to the past 4 days? But without more context, we use the average.\n\n But wait: the problem says the data will have missing values. In the provided data, there are none. So we can compute the average.\n\n However, if we look at the data, there is a drop in the middle of the day (negative values) and peaks in the early morning and evening.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (8.707 + 6.899 + 6.497 + 10.583) / 4 = 8.1715\n   hour1: (8.239 + 6.363 + 7.435 + 8.707) / 4 = 7.686\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the last day (2017-05-28) has a value of 8.707 at hour1? Actually, the data for 2017-05-28 01:00:00 is 8.707? \n   Let me check: \n        2017-05-28 00:00:00 -> 10.583\n        2017-05-28 01:00:00 -> 8.707? Actually, the data for 2017-05-28 01:00:00 is the second row? \n\n   The data for 2017-05-28:\n        00:00:00  10.583\n        01:00:00   8.707   -> but wait, the data provided for 2017-05-28 01:00:00 is actually the second row of that day? \n\n   Actually, the data is:\n\n        2017-05-28 00:00:00  10.583\n        2017-05-28 01:00:00   8.707   -> but in the given data, the next row after 2017-05-28 00:00:00 is 2017-05-28 01:00:00: 8.707? \n\n   However, looking at the provided data, the last day (2017-05-28) has:\n        00:00:00  10.583\n        01:00:00   8.707   -> but wait, the previous day (2017-05-27) at 01:00:00 was 7.435.\n\n   So we have:\n\n        hour0: [8.707, 6.899, 6.497, 10.583] -> average = (8.707+6.899+6.497+10.583)/4 = 32.686/4 = 8.1715\n        hour1: [8.239, 6.363, 7.435, 8.707] -> (8.239+6.363+7.435+8.707)=30.744/4=7.686\n\n   But wait, the last day (2017-05-28) at 01:00:00 is 8.707? Actually, the data for 2017-05-28 01:00:00 is the second row of that day, which is 8.707? \n\n   However, the data provided for 2017-05-28 01:00:00 is 8.707? But in the list above, the last day (2017-05-28) has:\n\n        00:00:00  10.583\n        01:00:00   8.707   -> so yes.\n\n   So we compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (2017-05-29 to 2017-06-01), we will have:\n\n        Day1 (2017-05-29): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... , avg_hour23]\n        Day2 (2017-05-30): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-05-31): same as above\n        Day4 (2017-06-01): same as above\n\n But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. However, we are not told that the future data we are forecasting will be missing. \n   We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided data might have missing values? \n   But in the provided data, we have 96 points and no missing. So we proceed.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n   This might imply that the provided data has missing values? But the data we are given does not have any missing? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and then the data is provided without missing. \n\n   So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n   Step 2: Generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-05-29 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-01 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 3: For each day in the forecast period (4 days), assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   However, note: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to model. Also, the average will smooth out the daily pattern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-28) as the forecast for the next day, then the day before that for the next, but that would be a naive approach.\n\n   But the problem: we are an expert, so we should use a more robust method? However, with limited data, the average by hour is a common baseline.\n\n   Let's compare with a naive seasonal forecast: using the last day (2017-05-28) repeated 4 times? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the method. We choose the average by hour because it is more stable.\n\n   We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (8.707 + 6.899 + 6.497 + 10.583) / 4 = 8.1715\n        hour1: (8.239 + 6.363 + 7.435 + 8.707) / 4 = 7.686\n        hour2: (8.105 + 4.086 + 6.430 + 9.444) / 4 = 7.01625\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then, for the next 96 hours, we assign:\n\n        2017-05-29 00:00:00: 8.1715\n        2017-05-29 01:00:00: 7.686\n        ... until 2017-05-29 23:00:00: average of hour23\n        2017-05-30 00:00:00: 8.1715\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, note: the input data has up to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and then average.\n\n   How to align the data:\n\n        The first record: 2017-05-25 00:00:00 -> hour0\n        Then 01:00:00 -> hour1, ... 23:00:00 -> hour23.\n\n        Then 2017-05-26 00:00:00 -> hour0 again.\n\n   So we have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n   We can group by the hour of the day.\n\n   We'll create an array for each hour index (0 to 23) and collect the values.\n\n   Then compute the mean for each hour index.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days is the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   Code for grouping (pseudo-code):\n\n        hours = {}\n        for i in range(0, 96):\n            hour_index = i % 24\n            value = data[i]['HUFL']\n            if hour_index not in hours:\n                hours[hour_index] = []\n            hours[hour_index].append(value)\n\n        avg_hour = {}\n        for h in range(0,24):\n            avg_hour[h] = sum(hours[h]) / len(hours[h])\n\n   Then for the next 96 hours:\n\n        for day in range(0,4):\n            for h in range(0,24):\n                timestamp = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=h)\n                value = avg_hour[h]\n\n   The start_date for the forecast is 2017-05-29 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-05-28).\n\n   We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        Day0: 2017-05-29 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day1: 2017-05-30 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-05-31 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-06-01 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n   We must format the timestamps as in the input: \"2017-05-29 00:00:00\"\n\n   And the HUFL value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        We have the data in a list. We'll write a small code in our mind or use a calculator for each hour.\n\n        But note: we are to provide the complete data, so we must compute 24 averages.\n\n        We'll do it step by step.\n\n        Hour0 (00:00): \n            Days: 2017-05-25: 8.707, 2017-05-26: 6.899, 2017-05-27: 6.497, 2017-05-28: 10.583\n            Sum = 8.707+6.899+6.497+10.583 = 32.686\n            Avg = 32.686/4 = 8.1715 -> 8.172 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n        Hour1 (01:00):\n            8.239, 6.363, 7.435, 8.707 -> 8.239+6.363=14.602; 14.602+7.435=22.037; 22.037+8.707=30.744 -> 30.744/4=7.686 -> 7.686\n\n        Hour2 (02:00):\n            8.105, 4.086, 6.430, 9.444 -> 8.105+4.086=12.191; 12.191+6.430=18.621; 18.621+9.444=28.065 -> 28.065/4=7.01625 -> 7.016\n\n        Hour3 (03:00):\n            7.234, 5.358, 7.569, 8.573 -> 7.234+5.358=12.592; 12.592+7.569=20.161; 20.161+8.573=28.734 -> 28.734/4=7.1835 -> 7.184\n\n        But wait, the data for 2017-05-28 03:00:00 is 8.573? \n            The data: \n                2017-05-28 02:00:00   9.444\n                2017-05-28 03:00:00   8.573 -> yes.\n\n        Hour4 (04:00):\n            6.698, 6.296, 7.636, 9.712 -> 6.698+6.296=12.994; 12.994+7.636=20.63; 20.63+9.712=30.342 -> 30.342/4=7.5855 -> 7.586\n\n        Hour5 (05:00):\n            9.176, 8.105, 7.904, 9.243 -> 9.176+8.105=17.281; 17.281+7.904=25.185; 25.185+9.243=34.428 -> 34.428/4=8.607\n\n        Hour6 (06:00):\n            10.181, 8.372, 8.306, 9.645 -> 10.181+8.372=18.553; 18.553+8.306=26.859; 26.859+9.645=36.504 -> 36.504/4=9.126\n\n        Hour7 (07:00):\n            2.210, 4.354, 4.287, 6.229 -> 2.210+4.354=6.564; 6.564+4.287=10.851; 10.851+6.229=17.08 -> 17.08/4=4.270\n\n        Hour8 (08:00):\n            -2.076, -1.005, -0.201, 0.335 -> (-2.076)+(-1.005)= -3.081; -3.081+(-0.201)= -3.282; -3.282+0.335=-2.947 -> -2.947/4=-0.73675 -> -0.737\n\n        Hour9 (09:00):\n            -6.899, -6.229, -4.354, -4.555 -> (-6.899)+(-6.229)= -13.128; -13.128+(-4.354)= -17.482; -17.482+(-4.555)= -22.037 -> -22.037/4=-5.50925 -> -5.509\n\n        Hour10 (10:00):\n            -7.837, -9.109, -7.837, -6.430 -> \n            Note: the data for 2017-05-27 10:00:00 is -7.837? \n            Actually, the data: \n                2017-05-25 10:00:00: -7.837\n                2017-05-26 10:00:00: -9.109\n                2017-05-27 10:00:00: -7.837? \n                2017-05-28 10:00:00: -6.430\n            So: -7.837 + (-9.109) = -16.946; -16.946 + (-7.837) = -24.783; -24.783 + (-6.430) = -31.213 -> -31.213/4 = -7.80325 -> -7.803\n\n        Hour11 (11:00):\n            -3.416, -11.119, -8.975, -7.703 -> \n            -3.416 + (-11.119) = -14.535; -14.535 + (-8.975) = -23.51; -23.51 + (-7.703) = -31.213 -> -31.213/4 = -7.80325 -> -7.803\n\n        But wait, that is the same as hour10?

But by chance the sum is the same? \n\n        Actually, the values for hour11 are: \n            2017-05-25: -3.416\n            2017-05-26: -11.119\n            2017-05-27: -8.975\n            2017-05-28: -7.703\n\n        So: -3.416 -11.119 = -14.535; -14.535 -8.975 = -23.51; -23.51 -7.703 = -31.213 -> same as hour10? \n\n        But hour10: -7.837, -9.109, -7.837, -6.430 -> \n            -7.837 -9.109 = -16.946; -16.946 -7.837 = -24.783; -24.783 -6.430 = -31.213 -> same sum? \n\n        So both hour10 and hour11 have the same sum?
