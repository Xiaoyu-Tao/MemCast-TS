        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) as seen in the provided 4 days.\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. However, the forecast should account for the possibility of missing data in the future? \n    But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points do not have any missing values? \n    We are only given 96 points and they are complete. So we can use them as is.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal time series model.\n\n Approach:\n Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need for 4 days forecast, we can use a model that can capture seasonality.\n\n Options:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): but with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be hard to estimate. However, we have 96 points which is enough for daily seasonality (24 lags).\n   - Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters): suitable for seasonality and short-term forecasts.\n\n However, note that the data shows a pattern that repeats daily but with some variation. Also, note that the last day (2017-08-16) has a much higher load than the previous days.\n\n Considering the last day's spike, we might need a model that can adapt to level shifts? But with only 4 days, it's challenging.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: forecast each hour of the next day by the average of the same hour in the past days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values? However, the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96. We are not told of any missing values in the forecast period? \n We are to provide the complete data for the next 96.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the exact method, and we are to provide the forecast, we choose a method: \n We will use a simple approach: \n   - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the available 4 days, but we note that the last day is an anomaly (much higher). \n   - Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-16) as the pattern for the next days? But that might be too high? \n   - Or we can use a weighted average where the last day has more weight? \n\n However, without more context, we must make an assumption. Since the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and we see a spike on the last day, it might be a weekday pattern? \n The provided data starts on a Sunday (2017-08-13) and goes to Wednesday (2017-08-16). The next 4 days would be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n We don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only one week? and only 4 days). \n\n Considering the above, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the next days, but we note that the last day (Wednesday) is an outlier? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour? \n\n Let's look at the data:\n\n For example, Monday (2017-08-14) and Tuesday (2017-08-15) and Wednesday (2017-08-16) are weekdays, and Sunday (2017-08-13) is a weekend? \n\n But we don't have enough days to separate weekdays and weekends.\n\n Given the constraints, we will use the average of the same hour for the 4 available days to forecast the next 4 days? \n\n However, the next 4 days are: \n   2017-08-17: Thursday\n   2017-08-18: Friday\n   2017-08-19: Saturday\n   2017-08-20: Sunday\n\n We have one Sunday (2017-08-13) and then weekdays. We don't have a Thursday, Friday, Saturday in the history.\n\n So we cannot rely on the same day of week. \n\n Therefore, we will use the entire 4 days to compute the average for each hour. \n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n But note: the last day (Wednesday) has much higher values. This might be because of a special event? or because it's a weekday? \n\n Since we are forecasting the next 4 days which include two weekdays (Thursday, Friday) and two weekend days (Saturday, Sunday), we might expect the weekend days to be lower.\n\n However, we don't have enough data to model that. \n\n Alternative: use the median? to reduce the effect of the last day? \n\n But the problem does not specify. \n\n We decide to use the median for each hour to avoid the spike on Wednesday from dominating the forecast for the weekend.\n\n How about: \n   For each hour (0 to 23), we compute the median of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days) we repeat the median pattern for each day.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n   We have:\n        2017-08-13 00:00:00: 0.487\n        2017-08-14 00:00:00: 0.761\n        2017-08-15 00:00:00: 0.548\n        2017-08-16 00:00:00: 1.157\n   The median: sort [0.487, 0.548, 0.761, 1.157] -> median = (0.548+0.761)/2 = 0.6545? \n   Actually, for even number of observations, we take the average of the two middle ones.\n\n   So for each hour, we compute the median of the 4 days.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same pattern (the 24 medians) repeated for each day.\n\n This method is simple and robust to the spike on the last day.\n\n Let's compute the medians for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: [0.487, 0.761, 0.548, 1.157] -> sorted: [0.487, 0.548, 0.761, 1.157] -> median = (0.548+0.761)/2 = 0.6545\n Hour 1: [0.487, 0.670, 0.579, 0.883] -> sorted: [0.487, 0.579, 0.670, 0.883] -> median = (0.579+0.670)/2 = 0.6245\n ... and so on.\n\n We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can group by hour of day.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and collect the 4 values for that hour.\n\n   Then compute the median for each hour.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n        Day 1 (2017-08-17): hour0, hour1, ... hour23 -> the medians\n        Day 2 (2017-08-18): same medians\n        Day 3 (2017-08-19): same medians\n        Day 4 (2017-08-20): same medians\n\n However, note that the last day (2017-08-16) was an anomaly. By using the median, we are reducing its effect.\n\n But is this the best? We are not capturing the trend? The data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days? \n The first three days are relatively stable and then the last day jumps. \n\n Since we don't know the cause, and we are forecasting 4 days, we assume that the pattern will revert to a typical day (represented by the median of the available days).\n\n Alternatively, we could use the median of the first three days? But we don't have a reason to exclude the last day entirely.\n\n We'll proceed with the median of all four days.\n\n Let's compute the medians for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: [0.487, 0.761, 0.548, 1.157] -> 0.6545\n Hour 1: [0.487, 0.670, 0.579, 0.883] -> 0.6245\n Hour 2: [0.487, 0.670, 0.670, 0.853] -> (0.670+0.670)/2 = 0.670\n Hour 3: [0.487, 0.670, 0.609, 0.670] -> sorted: [0.487,0.609,0.670,0.670] -> (0.609+0.670)/2 = 0.6395\n Hour 4: [0.518,0.761,0.914,1.218] -> sorted: [0.518,0.761,0.914,1.218] -> (0.761+0.914)/2 = 0.8375\n Hour 5: [0.670,0.975,0.853,1.127] -> sorted: [0.670,0.853,0.975,1.127] -> (0.853+0.975)/2 = 0.914\n Hour 6: [0.944,1.127,0.944,1.157] -> sorted: [0.944,0.944,1.127,1.157] -> (0.944+1.127)/2 = 1.0355\n Hour 7: [1.157,1.066,0.975,0.914] -> sorted: [0.914,0.975,1.066,1.157] -> (0.975+1.066)/2 = 1.0205\n Hour 8: [1.401,1.188,0.914,0.670] -> sorted: [0.670,0.914,1.188,1.401] -> (0.914+1.188)/2 = 1.051\n Hour 9: [1.492,0.883,0.975,0.157] -> Wait, the 10th hour of 2017-08-16 is 1.097?

The problem says \"the complete data\", meaning just the rows? \n\n Since the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the example input included the header, but then the data without header? Actually, the example input had:\n\n        date  LULL\n        2017-08-13 0.487 ...\n\n But then the data rows. However, the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the example output format does not specify.\n\n Looking at the example input: the user provided the data without the header? Actually, the user provided:\n\n               date  LULL\n        2017-08-13 00:00:00 0.487\n\n But then the data rows. So we assume we are to output without the header? \n\n However, the problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\", and the example input included the header. \n\n But the instruction for the answer format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n And the example, the user provided the data with the header? \n\n We decide to output without the header, just the 96 rows of data (each row: date string and the value).\n\n But note: the original data had the date as a string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and then the float.\n\n We'll output:\n\n        \"2017-08-17 00:00:00 0.655\"\n        etc.\n\n However, the example input had the date and time in one string and then the float. We do the same.\n\n But note: the example input had the date string without quotes? and the float with 3 decimals.\n\n We output without quotes.\n\n Let's generate the 96 rows.\n\n Steps:\n\n   dates = []\n   start = datetime(2017,8,17,0,0,0)\n   for day in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date_str = (start + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            value = median[hour]   # the median for that hour\n\n   Then output: date_str + \" \" + str(round(value,3))\n\n But note: we have the medians for hour0 to hour23.\n\n We'll write the code in our mind to generate the output.\n\n However, we are to output in the answer.\n\n We write the 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and \"obey the format strictly\".\n\n We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-17 00:00:00 0.655\n2017-08-17 01:00:00 0.624\n2017-08-17 02:00:00 0.670\n2017-08-17 03:00:00 0.640\n2017-08-17 04:00:00 0.838\n2017-08-17 05:00:00 0.914\n2017-08-17 06:00:00 1.036\n2017-08-17 07:00:00 1.021\n2017-08-17 08:00:00 1.051\n2017-08-17 09:00:00 0.929\n2017-08-17 10:00:00 1.188\n2017-08-17 11:00:00 1.142\n2017-08-17 12:00:00 1.005\n2017-08-17 13:00:00 1.112\n2017-08-17 14:00:00 0.990\n2017-08-17 15:00:00 1.127\n2017-08-17 16:00:00 0.975\n2017-08-17 17:00:00 0.975\n2017-08-17 18:00:00 0.822\n2017-08-17 19:00:00 0.686\n2017-08-17 20:00:00 1.005\n2017-08-17 21:00:00 0.899\n2017-08-17 22:00:00 0.655\n2017-08-17 23:00:00 0.899\n2017-08-18 00:00:00 0.655\n2017-08-18 01:00:00 0.624\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n But note: the last day (2017-08-20) should end at 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the entire 96 rows.\n\n However, to save space, we can write a loop?
