        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. \n    However, we must be cautious for the forecast period.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the limited data (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96-step forecast, \n    we can consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple naive approach. However, the data shows some daily patterns (diurnal variation) and non-constant variance.\n\n 3. We observe that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern: for example, the values tend to lower levels during the night and higher during the day? But looking at the data, it's not very clear. \n      However, we see that the values at the same hour of the day might be similar.\n\n 4. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast without missing values, we can use a model that can handle multiple seasonality. \n    But note: we only have 4 days of data, so 4 cycles of 24 hours). This is very limited for complex models.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    a) Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and then forecast each component? \n    b) Or use a naive seasonal forecast: use the last available day (or average of the past 4 days) for the same hour.\n\n 6. Considering the data, we see that the pattern is not very stable. For example, the first day (2017-06-06) has a minimum of 0.249 and maximum of 2.559, \n    while the next days have different patterns.\n\n 7. We can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days? That is, for hour 00:00, we take the average of the 00:00 of the 4 given days, and so on.\n\n    Let's denote:\n        Day0: 2017-06-06\n        Day1: 2017-06-07\n        Day2: 2017-06-08\n        Day3: 2017-06-09\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (Day4 to Day7) at hour h, we forecast:\n        MULL_{day4, h} = average of (MULL_{day0, h}, MULL_{day1, h}, MULL_{day2, h}, MULL_{day3, h})\n        Similarly for day5, day6, day7: same as day4? But that would be constant for each day.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the same pattern as the last day (2017-06-09) for the next 4 days? But that might not capture the average.\n\n 8. Another idea: use a moving average for the same hour. Since we have 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a trend? But 4 days is too short to see a trend.\n\n 9. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the day:\n            value = (day0_h + day1_h + day3_h + day3_h) / 4\n\n        Then we repeat this same pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 10. But note: the data for 2017-06-09 has a 0.000 at 21:00. This might be an outlier? But we are averaging so it will be smoothed.\n\n 11. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 00:00: (2.559, 3.305, 2.452, 2.168) -> (2.559+3.305+2.452+2.168)/4 = 10.484/4 = 2.621\n        Hour 01:00: (1.990, 2.487, 3.056, 1.102) -> (1.990+2.487+3.056+1.102)/4 = 8.635/4 = 2.15875\n        ... and so on.\n\n 12. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 13. However, note that the pattern might not be exactly the same? But with only 4 days, we don't have enough to model a weekly pattern.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-06-09) as the pattern? But the user said the data has missing values? Actually, the provided data does not have missing values, but the forecast period might? \n     But we are to provide the complete data without missing values.\n\n 15. We choose the method of averaging the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n 16. We must generate 96 data points: starting from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00.\n\n 17. Steps to generate:\n\n        Let base_date = 2017-06-10 00:00:00\n        We have 4 days: 10, 11, 12, 13.\n\n        For each day in [10, 11, 12, 13]:\n            For each hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n                value = average of the same hour from the past 4 days (06-06, 06-07, 06-08, 06-09)\n\n 18. We must be cautious: the provided data ends at 2017-06-09 23:00:00. The next day is 2017-06-10.\n\n 19. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n        For h in 0..23:\n            indices = [h, h+24, h+48, h+72]   # because 96 points = 4*24\n            values = [data[i] for i in indices]   # data is the MULL column\n\n        Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 20. Example for h=0 (00:00): \n        data[0] = 2.559 (2017-06-06 00:00)\n        data[24] = 3.305 (2017-06-07 00:00)\n        data[48] = 2.452 (2017-06-08 00:00)\n        data[72] = 2.168 (2017-06-09 00:00)\n        avg = (2.559+3.305+2.452+2.168)/4 = 10.484/4 = 2.621\n\n     h=1 (01:00):\n        data[1] = 1.990\n        data[25] = 2.487\n        data[49] = 3.056\n        data[73] = 1.102\n        avg = (1.990+2.487+3.056+1.102)/4 = 8.635/4 = 2.15875\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 21. We'll compute all 24 hourly averages and then repeat them for 4 days.\n\n 22. We must format the dates correctly. The next date after 2017-06-09 23:00:00 is 2017-06-10 00:00:00.\n\n 23. We generate the dates:\n\n        day0: 2017-06-10\n        day1: 2017-06-11\n        day2: 2017-06-12\n        day3: 2017-06-13\n\n        For each day, we have 24 hours.\n\n 24. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MULL'\n\n 25. We must round the numbers? The input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. Let's code the computation:\n\n        Step 1: Extract the MULL values as a list of 96 numbers.\n        Step 2: Precompute the 24 hourly averages.\n        Step 3: Create the next 96 dates: starting from '2017-06-10 00:00:00', then every hour for 96 hours.\n        Step 4: For the MULL values: repeat the 24 averages 4 times.\n\n 27. However, note: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, we cannot be sure. The average method is simple and robust.\n\n 28. We'll do:\n\n        hourly_avg = []\n        for h in range(24):\n            total = 0\n            for day in range(4):\n                index = h + day*24\n                total += data[index]\n            avg = total / 4\n            hourly_avg.append(round(avg, 3))\n\n        Then the forecast MULL for the next 96 hours is: \n            forecast = hourly_avg * 4   (i.e., repeat the list 4 times)\n\n 29. But note: the data provided is exactly 96 points (4*24). We can use the list of MULL values as provided.\n\n 30. Let's write the MULL values from the input:\n\n        data = [\n            2.559, 1.990, 2.452, 1.315, 1.706, 2.097, 1.102, 0.995, 0.959, 1.137, 1.279, 0.853, 0.533, 1.137, 1.244, 1.492, 0.533, 0.249, 0.746, 0.782, 0.675, 1.492, 0.888, 1.528, \n            3.305, 2.487, 2.594, 2.416, 1.528, 2.239, 3.056, 3.127, 2.736, 2.203, 2.061, 2.630, 1.279, 2.132, 2.381, 2.168, 1.279, 0.995, 0.569, 0.640, 0.675, 0.426, 1.102, 1.421,\n \n            2.452, 3.056, 2.914, 2.843, 2.025, 2.097, 2.452, 2.559, 1.670, 2.381, 3.305, 2.452, 1.208, 0.995, 1.706, 1.741, 1.208, 1.137, 0.782, 0.817, 0.675, 0.426, 0.497, 0.959,\n \n            2.168, 1.102, 2.523, 2.559, 2.274, 1.564, 2.949, 2.168, 2.559, 2.168, 1.954, 2.239, 1.315, 1.670, 1.492, 1.990, 1.315, 1.137, 0.711, 0.746, 0.675, 0.000, 0.533, 0.320\n        ]\n\n 31. Now compute the hourly averages:\n\n        h0: (2.559 + 3.305 + 2.452 + 2.168) / 4 = 10.484/4 = 2.621\n        h1: (1.990 + 2.487 + 3.056 + 1.102) / 4 = 8.635/4 = 2.15875 -> 2.159\n        ... \n\n 32. We'll compute each and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. Then the forecast for:\n\n        2017-06-10 00:00:00 -> 2.621\n        2017-06-10 01:00:00 -> 2.159\n        ... until 2017-06-10 23:00:00 -> (the 24th average)\n\n        then 2017-06-11 00:00:00 -> 2.621 again, and so on.\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 6, 10, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = []\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))\n\n 35. Then the MULL values: 4 repetitions of the hourly_avg list.\n\n 36. We output in the required format.\n\n 37. However, note: the user said the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. \n     We are not handling missing values in the input because there are none. For the forecast, we are providing complete data.\n\n 38. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        h0: (2.559, 3.305, 2.452, 2.168) -> 2.621\n        h1: (1.990, 2.487, 3.056, 1.102) -> 2.15875 -> 2.159\n        h2: (2.452, 2.594, 2.914, 2.523) -> (2.452+2.594+2.914+2.523)=10.483 -> 10.483/4=2.62075 -> 2.621\n        h3: (1.315, 2.416, 2.843, 2.559) -> (1.315+2.416+2.843+2.559)=9.133 -> 9.133/4=2.28325 -> 2.283\n        h4: (1.706, 1.528, 2.025, 2.274) -> (1.706+1.528+2.025+2.274)=7.533 -> 7.533/4=1.88325 -> 1.883\n        h5: (2.097, 2.239, 2.097, 1.564) -> (2.097+2.239+2.097+1.564)=7.997 -> 7.997/4=1.99925 -> 1.999\n        h6: (1.102, 3.056, 2.452, 2.949) -> (1.102+3.056+2.452+2.949)=9.559 -> 9.559/4=2.38975 -> 2.390\n        h7: (0.995, 3.127, 2.559, 2.168) -> (0.995+3.127+2.559+2.168)=8.849 -> 8.849/4=2.21225 -> 2.212\n        h8: (0.959, 2.736, 1.670, 2.559) -> (0.959+2.736+1.670+2.559)=7.924 -> 7.924/4=1.981\n        h9: (1.137, 2.203, 2.381, 2.168) -> (1.137+2.203+2.381+2.168)=7.889 -> 7.889/4=1.97225 -> 1.972\n        h10: (1.279, 2.061, 3.305, 1.954) -> (1.279+2.061+3.305+1.954)=8.599 -> 8.599/4=2.14975 -> 2.150\n        h11: (0.853, 2.630, 2.452, 2.239) -> (0.853+2.630+2.452+2.239)=8.174 -> 8.174/4=2.0435 -> 2.044\n        h12: (0.533, 1.279, 1.208, 1.315) -> (0.533+1.279+1.208+1.315)=4.335 -> 4.335/4=1.08375 -> 1.084\n        h13: (1.137, 2.132, 0.995, 1.670) -> (1.137+2.132+0.995+1.670)=5.934 -> 5.934/4=1.4835 -> 1.484\n        h14: (1.244, 2.381, 1.706, 1.492) -> (1.244+2.381+1.706+1.492)=6.823 -> 6.823/4=1.70575 -> 1.706\n        h15: (1.492, 2.168, 1.741, 1.990) -> (1.492+2.168+1.741+1.990)=7.391 -> 7.391/4=1.84775 -> 1.848\n        h16: (0.533, 1.279, 1.208, 1.315) -> same as h12? Actually, the data for h16: \n              day0: 0.533, day1: 1.279, day2: 1.208, day3: 1.315 -> same as h12? \n              But h12: 0.533 (day0), 1.279 (day1), 1.208 (day2), 1.315 (day3) -> yes, same numbers.

Now, we have the 24 averages:\n\n        h0: 2.621\n        h1: 2.159\n        h2: 2.621\n        h3: 2.283\n        h4: 1.883\n        h5: 1.999\n        h6: 2.390\n        h7: 2.212\n        h8: 1.981\n        h9: 1.972\n        h10: 2.150\n        h11: 2.044\n        h12: 1.084\n        h13: 1.484\n        h14: 1.706\n        h15: 1.848\n        h16: 1.084   # same as h12\n        h17: 0.880\n        h18: 0.702\n        h19: 0.746\n        h20: 0.675\n        h21: 0.586\n        h22: 0.755\n        h23: 1.057\n\n 40.

We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-10 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-06-10 01:00:00 ... until 2017-06-10 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-06-11 00:00:00 ... until 2017-06-11 23:00:00\n        ... until 2017-06-13 23:00:00\n\n 44.
