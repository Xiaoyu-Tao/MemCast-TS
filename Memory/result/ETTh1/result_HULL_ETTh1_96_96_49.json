        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious for the forecast.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with a time series that might have daily seasonality (24-hour pattern), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n However, note that the data is only 4 days, which is very short for training a complex model. We might use a simple method.\n\n Given the constraints, we have to provide 96 forecasted values.\n\n We can do:\n   - Use a naive seasonal approach: forecast each hour of the next day by the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? \n     But we only have 4 days of history.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n     - Exponential Smoothing (if we assume seasonality) but with such a short history, it might not be robust.\n     - Or, we can use the last available day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be only 24 hours, and we need 96.\n\n   However, note that the data shows a pattern that repeats daily? Let's check:\n\n   We have 4 days: 2017-01-13 to 2017-01-16.\n\n   We can try to compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days?\n\n   But note: the data might have a strong daily pattern? Let's see:\n\n   For example, at 00:00: \n        Day1: 2.009\n        Day2: 0.871\n        Day3: 1.072\n        Day4: 1.072\n        Average: (2.009+0.871+1.072+1.072)/4 = 1.256\n\n   Similarly, we can compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n   However, we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). We can use the same daily pattern repeated 4 times? \n\n   But note: the pattern might change over the week? We only have data from Friday (2017-01-13 is Friday) to Monday (2017-01-16 is Monday). \n   The next 4 days would be Tuesday to Friday? So we don't have the same days of the week for the same pattern.\n\n   Given the very limited data, we might not capture weekly seasonality. So we assume daily seasonality only.\n\n   Steps for the forecast:\n   - Compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days.\n   - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we use the computed average for each hour.\n\n   However, note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We ignore trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n   But the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? In the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing. So we can proceed.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (2.009 + 0.871 + 1.072 + 1.072) / 4 = 1.256\n        hour1: (1.674 + 0.804 + 1.474 + 1.072) / 4 = 1.256\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then, the forecast for:\n        2017-01-17 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.256\n        2017-01-17 01:00:00 -> hour1: 1.256\n        ... until 2017-01-20 23:00:00\n\n   But note: the average for each hour is fixed and we repeat the same pattern for each day.\n\n   However, we see that the data does not exactly repeat. For example, the first day (Friday) might be different from Monday? \n   But without more data, we cannot account for weekly seasonality.\n\n   This is a very simple method, but with only 4 days of data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model like ARIMA or Prophet, but with only 96 points and the need for 96 forecasts, \n   and without more context, the simple average might be acceptable.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not told that the provided 96 points have missing, but we are aware. \n   Since the provided data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We'll group by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and take the mean.\n\n   Steps in code (if we were coding) but we have to do it manually? We have 24 hours and 4 days.\n\n   We can create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values for that hour.\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 2017-01-13 00:00:00 -> 2.009\n        Day2: 2017-01-14 00:00:00 -> 0.871\n        Day3: 2017-01-15 00:00:00 -> 1.072\n        Day4: 2017-01-16 00:00:00 -> 1.072\n        Average = (2.009 + 0.871 + 1.072 + 1.072) / 4 = 5.024 / 4 = 1.256\n\n   Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.674\n        Day2: 0.804\n        Day3: 1.474\n        Day4: 1.072\n        Average = (1.674+0.804+1.474+1.072)/4 = 5.024/4 = 1.256\n\n   Wait, that's the same? Let me check: 1.674+0.804=2.478, 1.474+1.072=2.546 -> total 5.024 -> 1.256.\n\n   Actually, let me do the entire set? It might be that the sum of each hour over the 4 days is 5.024? \n\n   But that is a coincidence? Let me check hour 2 (02:00:00):\n        Day1: 1.608\n        Day2: 0.067\n        Day3: 1.139\n        Day4: 1.608\n        Sum = 1.608+0.067+1.139+1.608 = 4.422 -> average = 1.1055\n\n   So we have to compute each hour individually.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour0: 1.256\n        hour1: 1.256\n        hour2: (1.608+0.067+1.139+1.608)/4 = 4.422/4 = 1.1055\n        hour3: (1.273+0.603+0.469+0.737)/4 = (1.273+0.603=1.876, 0.469+0.737=1.206 -> total 3.082) -> 3.082/4=0.7705\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We have to do for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day5 (2017-01-17): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day6 (2017-01-18): same as above\n        Day7 (2017-01-19): same\n        Day8 (2017-01-20): same\n\n   We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   The last date in the input is 2017-01-16 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-01-17 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n   Format of the answer:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-17 00:00:00  <value>\n2017-01-17 01:00:00  <value>\n...\n2017-01-20 23:00:00  <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   We must compute the values for each hour.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and then average the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n   We'll list the data by hour of the day:\n\n        hour0: [2.0, 2.009, 0.871, 1.072, 1.072] -> but we have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days: day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n        We'll index by the hour in the day (0 to 23) and for each hour, we have 4 values.\n\n   We'll compute:\n\n        hour0: (2.009 + 0.871 + 1.072 + 1.072) / 4 = 1.256\n        hour1: (1.674 + 0.804 + 1.474 + 1.072) / 4 = (1.674+0.804=2.478, 1.474+1.072=2.546 -> 5.024) /4 = 1.256\n        hour2: (1.608 + 0.067 + 1.139 + 1.608) /4 = (1.608+0.067=1.675, 1.139+1.608=2.747 -> 4.422) /4 = 1.1055\n        hour3: (1.273 + 0.603 + 0.469 + 0.737) /4 = (1.273+0.603=1.876, 0.469+0.737=1.206 -> 3.082) /4 = 0.7705\n        hour4: (1.273 + 0.000 + 0.804 + 0.804) /4 = (1.273+0.000=1.273, 0.804+0.804=1.608 -> 2.881) /4 = 0.72025\n        hour5: (0.670 + 0.268 + 0.603 + 1.139) /4 = (0.670+0.268=0.938, 0.603+1.139=1.742 -> 2.68) /4 = 0.67\n        hour6: (0.804 + 0.603 + 0.603 + 0.737) /4 = (0.804+0.603=1.407, 0.603+0.737=1.34 -> 2.747) /4 = 0.68675\n        hour7: (-0.134 + 0.670 + 1.005 + 0.737) /4 = (-0.134+0.670=0.536, 1.005+0.737=1.742 -> 2.278) /4 = 0.5695\n        hour8: (0.469 + 1.340 + 1.674 + 1.139) /4 = (0.469+1.340=1.809, 1.674+1.139=2.813 -> 4.622) /4 = 1.1555\n        hour9: (0.000 + 0.804 + 1.005 + 1.072) /4 = (0.000+0.804=0.804, 1.005+1.072=2.077 -> 2.881) /4 = 0.72025\n        hour10: (0.134 + (-0.201) + 0.938 + 0.402) /4 = (0.134-0.201=-0.067, 0.938+0.402=1.34 -> 1.273) /4 = 0.31825\n        hour11: (0.201 + 0.670 + 1.072 + 0.268) /4 = (0.201+0.670=0.871, 1.072+0.268=1.34 -> 2.211) /4 = 0.55275\n        hour12: (-0.201 + 0.134 + 0.201 + (-0.201)) /4 = (-0.201+0.134=-0.067, 0.201-0.201=0 -> -0.067) /4 = -0.01675\n        hour13: (0.134 + 1.005 + 0.938 + 0.000) /4 = (0.134+1.005=1.139, 0.938+0.000=0.938 -> 2.077) /4 = 0.51925\n        hour14: (0.201 + 0.737 + 0.469 + 0.335) /4 = (0.201+0.737=0.938, 0.469+0.335=0.804 -> 1.742) /4 = 0.4355\n        hour15: (0.000 + 0.201 + 0.536 + 0.000) /4 = (0.000+0.201=0.201, 0.536+0.000=0.536 -> 0.737) /4 = 0.18425\n        hour16: (-0.603 + 0.000 + (-0.603) + (-1.139)) /4 = (-0.603+0.000=-0.603, -0.603-1.139=-1.742 -> -2.345) /4 = -0.58625\n        hour17: (-1.139 + 0.000 + (-0.201) + (-1.072)) /4 = (-1.139+0.000=-1.139, -0.201-1.072=-1.273 -> -2.412) /4 = -0.603\n        hour18: (-1.206 + (-0.335) + (-0.670) + (-1.474)) /4 = (-1.206-0.335=-1.541, -0.670-1.474=-2.144 -> -3.685) /4 = -0.92125\n        hour19: (-0.536 + (-0.134) + (-0.402) + (-0.871)) /4 = (-0.536-0.134=-0.67, -0.402-0.871=-1.273 -> -1.943) /4 = -0.48575\n        hour20: (-0.536 + (-0.335) + (-0.402) + (-0.670)) /4 = (-0.536-0.335=-0.871, -0.402-0.670=-1.072 -> -1.943) /4 = -0.48575\n        hour21: (-1.407 + (-1.273) + (-0.938) + (-0.603)) /4 = (-1.407-1.273=-2.68, -0.938-0.603=-1.541 -> -4.221) /4 = -1.05525\n        hour22: (0.536 + 0.603 + (-0.201) + 0.737) /4 = (0.536+0.603=1.139, -0.201+0.737=0.536 -> 1.675) /4 = 0.41875\n        hour23: (1.206 + 1.206 + 1.674 + 0.737) /4 = (1.206+1.206=2.412, 1.674+0.737=2.411 -> 4.823) /4 = 1.20575\n\n   Now, we have 24 values (from hour0 to hour23) for the daily pattern.\n\n   Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-17: hour0 to hour23: [1.256, 1.256, 1.1055, 0.7705, 0.72025, 0.67, 0.68675, 0.5695, 1.1555, 0.72025, 0.31825, 0.55275, -0.01675, 0.51925, 0.4355, 0.18425, -0.58625, -0.603, -0.92125, -0.48575, -0.48575, -1.05525, 0.41875, 1.20575]\n        Day2: 2017-01-18: same 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-01-19: same\n        Day4: 2017-01-20: same\n\n   We must generate the numbers with 3 decimal places?
