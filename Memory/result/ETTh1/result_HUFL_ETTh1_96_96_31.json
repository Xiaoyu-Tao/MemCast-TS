        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not show any in the given 96 points. However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points ahead, \n    we can consider models like ARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing that can handle seasonality.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - There seems to be a daily pattern (24-hour seasonality). For example, the values tend to peak at certain hours (like around 23:00) and dip at others.\n   - The data also shows some level of non-stationarity (the level changes over the days).\n\n Approach:\n   We will use a Seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) with:\n     - Non-seasonal order: (p, d, q)\n     - Seasonal order: (P, D, Q, s) with s=24 (for daily seasonality in hourly data)\n\n However, due to the complexity of the need to forecast 96 steps ahead and the short history, we might also consider a simpler model if SARIMA is too heavy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that automatically handles seasonality and trends, such as Facebook Prophet. But note the environment is text-based and we cannot run code.\n\n But note: We are an expert and we must provide the forecast.\n\n Since we cannot run actual code, we must rely on a typical approach and provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n However, the problem says: \"must provide the complete data\", meaning we have to output 96 forecasted values.\n\n Given the constraints, we will simulate a typical forecast by:\n\n   Step 1: Extrapolating the pattern observed in the last 4 days to the next 4 days, but with adjustments.\n\n   Step 2: We note that the data has:\n        - A daily pattern: \n            * The values are low during the early hours (00:00 to 05:00) but not consistently, \n            * Then they rise in the morning (06:00-08:00) and then dip again in the afternoon (12:00-15:00) and then rise again in the evening (17:00-19:00) and then peak at night (22:00-23:00).\n\n   Step 3: We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n   However, we only have 4 days. Let's check the overall level per day:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-11-02): average HUFL = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2 (2016-11-03): average HUFL\n        Day 3 (2016-11-04): average HUFL\n        Day 4 (2016-11-05): average HUFL\n\n   Then we can compute the trend in the daily level and project it for the next 4 days.\n\n   Step 4: Then for each hour in the day, we have a base pattern (the average for that hour over 4 days) and then adjust by the projected daily level.\n\n   But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to see a weekly pattern (only 4 days, which is less than a week). So we ignore weekly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour in the past days.\n\n   Method:\n\n     Let F(t) for t in [2016-11-06 00:00:00, 2016-11-09 23:00:00] be the forecast.\n\n     For a given hour h (0 to 23) on day d (where d=5,6,7,8 for Nov 6,7,8,9), we can compute:\n\n        F(d, h) = (1/4) * [ value at (d-4, h) + value at (d-3, h) + value at (d-2, h) + value at (d-1, h) ]\n\n     But note: we only have 4 days, so for the first forecast day (Nov 6) we use:\n\n        Nov 6, 00:00: average of Nov 2,00:00; Nov 3,00:00; Nov 4,00:00; Nov 5,00:00.\n\n     However, this is a naive seasonal average and does not account for trend.\n\n   Step 5: We can also compute the daily average for each day and then the trend in these daily averages.\n\n        Daily averages:\n          Day1 (Nov2): A1\n          Day2 (Nov3): A2\n          Day3 (Nov4): A3\n          Day4 (Nov5): A4\n\n        The trend: let's compute the linear trend over these 4 points? Or use the average of the last two days?\n\n        We can compute the average daily level: \n          base_level = (A1+A2+A3+A4)/4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we can project the daily level as:\n\n          Day5 (Nov6): A5 = A4 + (A4 - A3)   [if we assume the increment from day3 to day4 continues?]\n          But note: \n            A1 = (6.899+6.162+...+11.588)/24 -> we don't have to compute exactly, but we can see the data.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a linear regression over the 4 days to get a slope, but that might be overkill.\n\n        Since the data is short, we can use the average of the last two days as the level for the next four days? \n\n        However, looking at the daily averages:\n\n          We can compute:\n\n          Nov2: \n            values: [6.899, 6.162, 6.497, 6.698, 5.626, 7.636, 8.105, 8.439, 7.569, 7.368, 7.569, 9.042, 5.626, 5.693, 6.095, 6.43, 6.229, 7.77, 7.1, 6.966, 6.631, 7.569, 9.779, 11.588]\n            sum = 170.291, mean = 170.291/24 = 7.095458333\n\n          Nov3:\n            [16.276, 14.937, 15.74, 14.803, 16.075, 14.535, 16.678, 17.08, 11.32, 7.77, 7.703, 8.372, 6.296, 5.626, 6.497, 5.693, 6.095, 7.569, 7.435, 7.167, 6.363, 5.559, 8.506, 10.918]\n            sum = 230.999, mean = 9.624958333\n\n          Nov4:\n            [11.922, 10.918, 11.186, 11.721, 11.588, 10.985, 11.119, 13.53, 10.717, 10.717, 8.172, 8.707, 5.76, 6.698, 6.028, 6.229, 6.564, 7.77, 7.502, 7.033, 6.162, 5.425, 7.301, 8.908]\n            sum = 193.662, mean = 8.06925\n\n          Nov5:\n            [12.458, 12.458, 11.989, 12.592, 12.391, 12.19, 13.195, 13.463, 8.908, 7.167, 7.703, 8.372, 6.229, 6.899, 6.095, 6.229, 6.363, 8.105, 7.502, 6.966, 6.095, 5.492, 8.908, 10.047]\n            sum = 201.236, mean = 8.384833333\n\n        The daily means: [7.095, 9.625, 8.069, 8.385]\n\n        There is no clear trend. We see a jump on Nov3 and then a drop and then a slight rise.\n\n        We might take the average of the last two days: (8.069+8.385)/2 = 8.227\n\n        But note: the data on Nov5 is higher than Nov4, so we might project a slight increase? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire 4 days: (7.095+9.625+8.069+8.385)/4 = 8.2935\n\n        Then we can set the daily level for the next 4 days to 8.2935? \n\n        However, the pattern on weekdays vs weekends? We don't know the days: \n          2016-11-02: Wednesday\n          2016-11-03: Thursday\n          2016-11-04: Friday\n          2016-11-05: Saturday\n\n        The next days: \n          2016-11-06: Sunday\n          2016-11-07: Monday\n          2016-11-08: Tuesday\n          2016-11-09: Wednesday\n\n        We might expect a different pattern on Sunday and Monday? But we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n   Step 6: Given the complexity and the lack of data, we will use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 available days, and then adjust the daily level to the overall average (8.2935) to avoid drift.\n\n        Let H(h) = (value at hour h on Nov2 + Nov3 + Nov4 + Nov5) / 4   for h in 0..23.\n\n        Then the overall average of H(0..23) should be 8.2935? Actually, the average of the 24 H(h) would be the average of the 4 daily averages, which is 8.2935.\n\n        Then we can set the forecast for each hour h on any of the next 4 days to H(h).\n\n        But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we will have 24*4=96 points, each day having the same 24 values? \n\n        However, we see that the daily pattern is not exactly the same every day? But we are averaging to smooth.\n\n   Step 7: Compute H(h) for each hour:\n\n        h0 (00:00): (6.899 + 16.276 + 11.922 + 12.458)/4 = (6.899+16.276=23.175; +11.922=35.097; +12.458=47.555) -> 47.555/4 = 11.88875\n        h1 (01:00): (6.162+14.937+10.918+12.458)/4 = (6.162+14.937=21.099; +10.918=32.017; +12.458=44.475) -> 44.475/4 = 11.11875\n        h2 (02:00): (6.497+15.74+11.186+11.989)/4 = (6.497+15.74=22.237; +11.186=33.423; +11.989=45.412) -> 45.412/4 = 11.353\n        h3 (03:00): (6.698+14.803+11.721+12.592)/4 = (6.698+14.803=21.501; +11.721=33.222; +12.592=45.814) -> 45.814/4 = 11.4535\n        h4 (04:00): (5.626+16.075+11.588+12.391)/4 = (5.626+16.075=21.701; +11.588=33.289; +12.391=45.68) -> 45.68/4 = 11.42\n        h5 (05:00): (7.636+14.535+10.985+12.19)/4 = (7.636+14.535=22.171; +10.985=33.156; +12.19=45.346) -> 45.346/4 = 11.3365\n        h6 (06:00): (8.105+16.678+11.119+13.195)/4 = (8.105+16.678=24.783; +11.119=35.902; +13.195=49.097) -> 49.097/4 = 12.27425\n        h7 (07:00): (8.439+17.08+13.53+13.463)/4 = (8.439+17.08=25.519; +13.53=39.049; +13.463=52.512) -> 52.512/4 = 13.128\n        h8 (08:00): (7.569+11.32+10.717+8.908)/4 = (7.569+11.32=18.889; +10.717=29.606; +8.908=38.514) -> 38.514/4 = 9.6285\n        h9 (09:00): (7.368+7.77+10.717+7.167)/4 = (7.368+7.77=15.138; +10.717=25.855; +7.167=33.022) -> 33.022/4 = 8.2555\n        h10 (10:00): (7.569+7.703+8.172+7.703)/4 = (7.569+7.703=15.272; +8.172=23.444; +7.703=31.147) -> 31.147/4 = 7.78675\n        h11 (11:00): (9.042+8.372+8.707+8.372)/4 = (9.042+8.372=17.414; +8.707=26.121; +8.372=34.493) -> 34.493/4 = 8.62325\n        h12 (12:00): (5.626+6.296+5.76+6.229)/4 = (5.626+6.296=11.922; +5.76=17.682; +6.229=23.911) -> 23.911/4 = 5.97775\n        h13 (13:00): (5.693+5.626+6.698+6.899)/4 = (5.693+5.626=11.319; +6.698=18.017; +6.899=24.916) -> 24.916/4 = 6.229\n        h14 (14:00): (6.095+6.497+6.028+6.095)/4 = (6.095+6.497=12.592; +6.028=18.62; +6.095=24.715) -> 24.715/4 = 6.17875\n        h15 (15:00): (6.43+5.693+6.229+6.229)/4 = (6.43+5.693=12.123; +6.229=18.352; +6.229=24.581) -> 24.581/4 = 6.14525\n        h16 (16:00): (6.229+6.095+6.564+6.363)/4 = (6.229+6.095=12.324; +6.564=18.888; +6.363=25.251) -> 25.251/4 = 6.31275\n        h17 (17:00): (7.77+7.569+7.77+8.105)/4 = (7.77+7.569=15.339; +7.77=23.109; +8.105=31.214) -> 31.214/4 = 7.8035\n        h18 (18:00): (7.1+7.435+7.502+7.502)/4 = (7.1+7.435=14.535; +7.502=22.037; +7.502=29.539) -> 29.539/4 = 7.38475\n        h19 (19:00): (6.966+7.167+7.033+6.966)/4 = (6.966+7.167=14.133; +7.033=21.166; +6.966=28.132) -> 28.132/4 = 7.033\n        h20 (20:00): (6.631+6.363+6.162+6.095)/4 = (6.631+6.363=12.994; +6.162=19.156; +6.095=25.251) -> 25.251/4 = 6.31275\n        h21 (21:00): (7.569+5.559+5.425+5.492)/4 = (7.569+5.559=13.128; +5.425=18.553; +5.492=24.045) -> 24.045/4 = 6.01125\n        h22 (22:00): (9.779+8.506+7.301+8.908)/4 = (9.779+8.506=18.285; +7.301=25.586; +8.908=34.494) -> 34.494/4 = 8.6235\n        h23 (23:00): (11.588+10.918+8.908+10.047)/4 = (11.588+10.918=22.506; +8.908=31.414; +10.047=41.461) -> 41.461/4 = 10.36525\n\n   Step 8: Then the forecast for the next 4 days (Nov6 to Nov9) will be:\n\n        Nov6: [h0, h1, ..., h23] = [11.88875, 11.11875, ... , 10.36525]\n        Nov7: same as Nov6\n        Nov8: same as Nov6\n        Nov9: same as Nov6\n\n   However, this does not account for the fact that the next days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We don't have data to capture weekly effects, so we use the same pattern.\n\n   But note: the provided data includes a Saturday (Nov5) and we are forecasting Sunday (Nov6) and then Monday (Nov7) which might be different. However, without weekly data, we cannot adjust.\n\n   Therefore, we output the same 24 values repeated for 4 days.\n\n   Step 9: Format the output.\n\n        We must output 96 rows, starting from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n\n        The dates:\n\n          2016-11-06 00:00:00\n          2016-11-06 01:00:00\n          ...\n          2016-11-06 23:00:00\n          2016-11-07 00:00:00\n          ...\n          2016-11-09 23:00:00\n\n        And the HUFL values are the 24 values we computed above, repeated 4 times.\n\n   Step 10: We must round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n        But note: the input has 3 decimal places, but the computed averages might have more. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Example: h0: 11.88875 -> 11.889\n\n        However, the input sometimes has 3 decimal places but the numbers are integers? Actually, they are floats.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Step 11: Write the output.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" in the past, but we are not given any in the provided 96. We assumed no missing in the provided. For the future, we are providing a complete forecast.\n\n   However, if we had missing values in the provided, we would have to impute. But we don't.\n\n   Let's compute the 24 values rounded:\n\n        h0: 11.88875 -> 11.889\n        h1: 11.11875 -> 11.119\n        h2: 11.353 -> 11.353\n        h3: 11.4535 -> 11.454\n        h4: 11.42 -> 11.420\n        h5: 11.3365 -> 11.337\n        h6: 12.27425 -> 12.274\n        h7: 13.128 -> 13.128\n        h8: 9.6285 -> 9.629\n        h9: 8.2555 -> 8.256\n        h10: 7.78675 -> 7.787\n        h11: 8.62325 -> 8.623\n        h12: 5.97775 -> 5.978\n        h13: 6.229 -> 6.229\n        h14: 6.17875 -> 6.179\n        h15: 6.14525 -> 6.145\n        h16: 6.31275 -> 6.313\n        h17: 7.8035 -> 7.804\n        h18: 7.38475 -> 7.385\n        h19: 7.033 -> 7.033\n        h20: 6.31275 -> 6.313\n        h21: 6.01125 -> 6.011\n        h22: 8.6235 -> 8.624\n        h23: 10.36525 -> 10.365\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n        2016-11-06 00:00:00  11.889\n        2016-11-06 01:00:00  11.119\n        2016-11-06 02:00:00  11.353\n        ... until 2016-11-06 23:00:00: 10.365\n        then 2016-11-07 00:00:00: 11.889\n        and so on.\n\n   However, note: the last provided data point is 2016-11-05 23:00:00, so the next day starts at 2016-11-06 00:00:00.\n\n   We output 4 days of the same 24 values.\n\n   But wait: the data we have shows that the pattern on Saturday (Nov5) is different from Wednesday (Nov2). We are averaging all days, so the forecast pattern is a blend. This is the best we can do without more data.\n\n   We'll output the data accordingly.\n\n   However, the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we output 96 rows.\n\n   Let's write the output in the required format.\n\n   Note: We are to output the date and the HUFL value.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-06 00:00:00  11.889\n2016-11-06 01:00:00  11.119\n2016-11-06 02:00:00  11.353\n2016-11-06 03:00:00  11.454\n2016-11-06 04:00:00  11.420\n2016-11-06 05:00:00  11.337\n2016-11-06 06:00:00  12.274\n2016-11-06 07:00:00  13.128\n2016-11-06 08:00:00  9.629\n2016-11-06 09:00:00  8.256\n2016-11-06 10:00:00  7.787\n2016-11-06 11:00:00  8.623\n2016-11-06 12:00:00  5.978\n2016-11-06 13:00:00  6.229\n2016-11-06 14:00:00  6.179\n2016-11-06 15:00:00  6.145\n2016-11-06 16:00:00  6.313\n2016-11-06 17:00:00  7.804\n2016-11-06 18:00:00  7.385\n2016-11-06 19:00:00  7.033\n2016-11-06 20:00:00  6.313\n2016-11-06 21:00:00  6.011\n2016-11-06 22:00:00  8.624\n2016-11-06 23:00:00  10.365\n2016-11-07 00:00:00  11.889\n2016-11-07 01:00:00  11.119\n2016-11-07 02:00:00  11.353\n... (repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days) ...\n2016-11-09 23:00:00  10.365\n\n   We'll generate the dates programmatically in the output.\n\n   However, note: the last day we output is 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 4 days: 6,7,8,9 of November 2016.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the rounding we did might have introduced a slight change in the daily average? We are not adjusting the daily level, but the average of the 24 H(h) should be about 8.2935? \n\n   We can check: \n        Sum of the 24 H(h) = 11.889+11.119+...+10.365 = \n        Let me compute:\n\n        We had the daily averages of the past 4 days: 7.095, 9.625, 8.069, 8.385 -> average 8.2935.\n\n        The average of the 24 H(h) is the same 8.2935? Actually, we computed H(h) as the average per hour over the 4 days, so the average of H(h) over 24 hours is the average of the 4 daily averages, which is 8.2935.\n\n        But we rounded each H(h). The rounded values might not sum to 8.2935*24? We don't require that.\n\n   We'll output the rounded values.\n\n   This is a simple and reasonable forecast given the constraints.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we didn't have any in the provided. If there were missing values in the provided, we would have to impute them first. But we don't.\n\n   We output the forecast.\n\n   Let's code the output.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-06 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-11-09 23:00:00\n\n        We have 4 days, 24 hours.\n\n   We have the 24 values for one day: let's list them as:\n\n        hourly_forecast = [\n            11.889, 11.119, 11.353, 11.454, 11.420, 11.337, \n            12.274, 13.128, 9.629, 8.256, 7.787, 8.623, \n            5.978, 6.229, 6.179, 6.145, 6.313, 7.804, \n            7.385, 7.033, 6.313, 6.011, 8.624, 10.365\n        ]\n\n   Then for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n        for hour_offset in [0,1,...,23]:\n            date = 2016-11-06 + day_offset days\n            time = hour_offset:00:00\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        for day in range(6, 10):   # 6,7,8,9 -> 4 days\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = f\"2016-11-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                # But note: day 6,7,8,9: but 6 is 06, 7 is 07, etc.\n\n   However, 2016-11-06 to 2016-11-09.\n\n   We must be careful: November has 30 days.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        day 6: 2016-11-06\n        day 7: 2016-11-07\n        day 8: 2016-11-08\n        day 9: 2016-11-09\n\n   Then we assign the hourly_forecast[hour] for that day.\n\n   We output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's write the answer.\n",
