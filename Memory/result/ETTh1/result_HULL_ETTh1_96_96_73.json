        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours = 96).\n 2. The data has some negative values and zeros, and the values are in a range of about -1.875 to 3.282.\n 3. We must account for the possibility of missing values in the provided data? But the given data for the past 96 points does not have any missing values? \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? \n    So we assume the provided 96 points are complete. But for forecasting, we must handle if the model requires imputation? However, we are only given the past 96 and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 4. We choose a model for forecasting. Since we are to provide 96 points and the data is hourly, we might consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly? But we only have 4 days, so weekly is not visible.\n    - We can use a model that captures daily patterns.\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use a simple model that captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 6. We note that the data might have a pattern: \n    - The values during the night (around 21:00 to 4:00) seem to have more variability, and during the day they are more.\n\n 7. Approach:\n    We can use a) a naive seasonal model (like using the average of the same hour from the past 4 days) or \n    b) a more sophisticated model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. However, with only 4 days, SARIMA might be overkill and we don't have enough data to fit complex models.\n\n 8. Considering the constraints, we can do:\n    - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days we have, and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check the last day (2017-04-22) has a different pattern? \n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-04-22) as the forecast for the next day? But we have 4 days and we are to forecast 4 days? \n\n 10. We can also consider a moving average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n 11. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    hour0: (1.608 + 1.808 + 1.541 + 0.670) / 4 = (1.608+1.808+1.541+0.670)=5.627/4=1.40675\n    hour1: (2.076+1.541+1.808+1.541) = (2.076+1.541+1.808+1.541)=6.966/4=1.7415\n    ... and so on.\n\n 12. But note: the data might have a strong daily pattern? and we have 4 days, so we can use the average per hour.\n\n 13. However, we must be cautious: the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 there are none. So we can use the average.\n\n 14. But let's check: the data for the same hour across days:\n\n    Example for hour 0: \n        2017-04-19 00:00:00  1.608\n        2017-04-20 00:00:00  1.808\n        2017-04-21 00:00:00  1.541\n        2017-04-22 00:00:00  0.670\n\n    There is a downward trend? But we have only 4 points. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? \n\n 15. Since we are to forecast 4 days, we can use the same pattern as the last day? or the average pattern? \n\n 16. We decide: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. That is, for each hour h (0-23) in the next 4 days, we set:\n        forecast = average of the h-th hour from the 4 days.\n\n 17. But note: the last day (2017-04-22) has a lower value? Maybe we should use a moving window? \n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing for each hour? But we have only 4 points per hour.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have very limited data, we go with the average per hour.\n\n 20. Steps for the forecast:\n      - For hour 0: average of the four hour0: (1.608, 1.808, 1.541, 0.670) = 1.40675\n      - For hour 1: (2.076, 1.541, 1.808, 1.541) = (2.076+1.541+1.808+1.541)/4 = 1.7415\n      - ... until hour 23.\n\n 21. Then we repeat the same 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 22. However, note: the next 4 (i.e., the 4 days from 2017-04-23 to 2017-04-26) are consecutive. So we will have 4 copies of the same 24-hour average pattern? \n\n 23. But wait, that would be 4 identical days? We can add a small random noise? But the problem does not require that. Alternatively, we can use the average without noise.\n\n 24. However, the problem says \"be aware of missing values\" but we are not given any in the input. So we assume the input is complete. For the forecast, we are to provide 96 points without missing values.\n\n 25. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Let's create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n    We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n    Example:\n        hour0: (1.608 + 1.808 + 1.541 + 0.670) / 4 = 1.40675\n        hour1: (2.076 + 1.541 + 1.808 + 1.541) / 4 = (2.076+1.541+1.808+1.541)=6.966/4=1.7415\n        hour2: (0.938+2.612+1.674+1.072)/4 = (0.938+2.612+1.674+1.072)=6.296/4=1.574\n        hour3: (0.670+2.679+2.277+0.670)/4 = (0.670+2.679+2.277+0.670)=6.296/4=1.574\n        ... \n\n 26. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 27. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days) we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 28. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to model a trend. So we assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 29. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    hour0: [1.608, 1.808, 1.541, 0.670] -> 1.40675\n    hour1: [2.076, 1.541, 1.808, 1.541] -> 1.7415\n    hour2: [0.938, 2.612, 1.674, 1.072] -> (0.938+2.612+1.674+1.072)=6.296 -> 1.574\n    hour3: [0.670, 2.679, 2.277, 0.670] -> (0.670+2.679+2.277+0.670)=6.296 -> 1.574\n    hour4: [1.541, 3.148, 1.407, -0.536] -> (1.541+3.148+1.407-0.536)=5.56 -> 1.39\n    hour5: [0.938, 3.282, 1.273, -0.603] -> (0.938+3.282+1.273-0.603)=4.89 -> 1.2225\n    hour6: [1.741, 2.009, 1.741, 0.737] -> (1.741+2.009+1.741+0.737)=6.228 -> 1.557\n    hour7: [1.139, 1.808, 2.277, 0.134] -> (1.139+1.808+2.277+0.134)=5.358 -> 1.3395\n    hour8: [1.206, 0.469, 1.674, 0.335] -> (1.206+0.469+1.674+0.335)=3.684 -> 0.921\n    hour9: [0.268, -0.067, 0.469, 1.005] -> (0.268-0.067+0.469+1.005)=1.675 -> 0.41875\n    hour10: [0.804, 1.072, 0.804, 1.340] -> (0.804+1.072+0.804+1.340)=4.02 -> 1.005\n    hour11: [0.737, 1.072, 0.402, 1.340] -> (0.737+1.072+0.402+1.340)=3.551 -> 0.88775\n    hour12: [0.000, 0.469, -0.268, 0.603] -> (0.000+0.469-0.268+0.603)=0.804 -> 0.201\n    hour13: [0.134, 0.469, 0.134, 1.808] -> (0.134+0.469+0.134+1.808)=2.545 -> 0.63625\n    hour14: [0.201, 0.000, -0.201, -0.268] -> (0.201+0.000-0.201-0.268)=-0.268 -> -0.067\n    hour15: [0.268, 0.067, 0.067, 0.603] -> (0.268+0.067+0.067+0.603)=1.005 -> 0.25125\n    hour16: [0.000, -0.603, -0.134, -0.067] -> (0.000-0.603-0.134-0.067)=-0.804 -> -0.201\n    hour17: [-0.201, -0.268, -0.067, -0.469] -> (-0.201-0.268-0.067-0.469)=-1.005 -> -0.25125\n    hour18: [-0.603, -0.603, -0.670, -0.469] -> (-0.603-0.603-0.670-0.469)=-2.345 -> -0.58625\n    hour19: [-0.737, -0.335, -0.536, -0.536] -> (-0.737-0.335-0.536-0.536)=-2.144 -> -0.536\n    hour20: [-0.737, -0.737, -0.603, -0.536] -> (-0.737-0.737-0.603-0.536)=-2.613 -> -0.65325\n    hour21: [-1.875, -0.670, -1.474, -0.938] -> (-1.875-0.670-1.474-0.938)=-4.957 -> -1.23925\n    hour22: [0.268, 0.335, -0.670, 0.067] -> (0.268+0.335-0.670+0.067)=0 -> 0\n    hour23: [1.072, 1.808, 0.134, 1.072] -> (1.072+1.808+0.134+1.072)=4.086 -> 1.0215\n\n 30. Now, we create the next 4 days (from 2017-04-23 00:00:00 to 2017-04-26 23:00:00) by repeating the above 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 31. The dates: \n        Start: 2017-04-23 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-04-22 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-04-23 01:00:00, ... until 2017-04-23 23:00:00, then 2017-04-24 00:00:00, ... until 2017-04-26 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We generate the dates and the corresponding HULL value (the average for that hour).\n\n 33. We output the data in the same format as the input, but for the next 96 hours.\n\n 34. However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 35. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-23 00:00:00  <value>\n2017-04-23 01:00:00  <value>\n...\n2017-04-26 23:00:00  <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 36. We use the computed hourly_avg for the 24 hours and repeat 4 times.\n\n 37. Let's write the hourly_avg array:\n\n        hour0: 1.40675\n        hour1: 1.7415\n        hour2: 1.574\n        hour3: 1.574\n        hour4: 1.39\n        hour5: 1.2225\n        hour6: 1.557\n        hour7: 1.3395\n        hour8: 0.921\n        hour9: 0.41875\n        hour10: 1.005\n        hour11: 0.88775\n        hour12: 0.201\n        hour13: 0.63625\n        hour14: -0.067\n        hour15: 0.25125\n        hour16: -0.201\n        hour17: -0.25125\n        hour18: -0.58625\n        hour19: -0.536\n        hour20: -0.65325\n        hour21: -1.23925\n        hour22: 0.0\n        hour23: 1.0215\n\n 38. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-23\n           00:00:00 -> 1.40675\n           01:00:00 -> 1.7415\n           02:00:00 -> 1.574\n           ... until 23:00:00 -> 1.0215\n\n        Then Day2: 2017-04-24: same pattern\n        Day3: 2017-04-25\n        Day4: 2017-04-26\n\n 39. We output the data with the date and the value rounded to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n 40. We round the values to 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. Let's round:\n\n        1.40675 -> 1.407\n        1.7415 -> 1.742\n        1.574 -> 1.574\n        1.574 -> 1.574\n        1.39 -> 1.390\n        1.2225 -> 1.223\n        1.557 -> 1.557\n        1.3395 -> 1.340\n        0.921 -> 0.921\n        0.41875 -> 0.419\n        1.005 -> 1.005\n        0.88775 -> 0.888\n        0.201 -> 0.201\n        0.63625 -> 0.636\n        -0.067 -> -0.067\n        0.25125 -> 0.251\n        -0.201 -> -0.201\n        -0.25125 -> -0.251\n        -0.58625 -> -0.586\n        -0.536 -> -0.536\n        -0.65325 -> -0.653\n        -1.23925 -> -1.239\n        0.0 -> 0.000\n        1.0215 -> 1.022\n\n 42. Now, we write the data.\n\n 43. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-23 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-23 01:00:00, ... until 2017-04-23 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-24 00:00:00, ... until 2017-04-24 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-25 00:00:00, ... until 2017-04-25 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-26 00:00:00, ... until 2017-04-26 23:00:00\n\n 44. We output 96 lines.\n\n 45. We code the output accordingly.\n\n 46. Note: We are to output in the exact format as the input, with the date string and the value.\n\n 47.
