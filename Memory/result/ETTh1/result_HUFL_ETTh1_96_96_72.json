        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) as seen from the provided 4 days.\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 hours is complete? (at least the sample provided has no missing values in the given segment).\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality of 24, we can use seasonal decomposition or models like SARIMA, but note that we are only given 4 days (96 points) which is very limited.\n\n However, the problem states that the data may have missing values, but the provided past 96 points are given without gaps. So for forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n Given the small data size, we can use a simple seasonal model. But note: we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data shows a daily pattern, we can consider:\n   - Using the average of each hour across the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be a constant pattern and may not capture trends.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data has a trend within the day and also from day to day? Let's look at the overall:\n\n   Day 1 (04-15): starts at 12.726, then goes down to negative and then up again.\n   Day 2 (04-16): similar pattern but the values are a bit different.\n   Day 3 (04-17): again similar pattern but with some variations.\n   Day 4 (04-18): again similar.\n\n We can try to compute the hourly average for the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day.\n\n However, note that the problem does not to omit any content and must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Since we are limited by the data, we are going to use the following:\n\n   Let H(d, h) be the HUFL on day d at hour h (where d=0 for 2017-04-15, d=1 for 2017-04-16, ... and h from 0 to 23).\n\n   We can compute the average for each hour h over the 4 days we have:\n\n        avg_h = (H(0,h) + H(1,h) + H(2,h) + H(3,h)) / 4\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (d=4,5,6,7) we set:\n\n        H(4, h) = avg_h\n        H(5, h) = avg_h\n        H(6, h) = avg_h\n        H(7, h) = avg_h\n\n   But this ignores any trend. Alternatively, we might use a weighted average or exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent days.\n\n However, given the very limited data, and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can also consider using the last day (d=3) as a base and adjust by the average daily pattern? But that might be complex.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last two days for each hour? But again, we are to forecast 4 days and we have 4 days of history.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to be practical, we choose the average method for each hour of the day.\n\n Steps for calculation:\n\n   We have 24 hours. For each hour (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from day1 to day4). We take the average.\n\n Example for hour 0:\n   Day1: 12.726\n   Day2: 10.851\n   Day3: 9.779\n   Day4: 11.655\n   avg0 = (12.726 + 10.851 + 9.779 + 11.655) / 4 = 11.011 / 4? Let me compute:\n\n   12.726 + 10.851 = 23.577\n   23.577 + 9.779 = 33.356\n   33.356 + 11.655 = 45.011\n   avg0 = 45.011 / 4 = 11.25275\n\n Similarly for hour 1:\n   Day1: 12.257\n   Day2: 11.253\n   Day3: 11.655\n   Day4: 10.315\n   (12.257 + 11.253 + 11.655 + 10.315) = 45.48 / 4 = 11.37\n\n But note: we are to provide 4 days of forecast (96 hours). So we will have 4 days of the same 24-hour average pattern.\n\n However, we must generate 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We create a list of 24 average values (for hour0 to hour23).\n\n   Then we repeat this list 4 times to cover 4 days.\n\n   The dates: \n        Start: 2017-04-19 00:00:00 (next day after 2017-04-18 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-04-19 01:00:00 ... up to 2017-04-19 23:00:00 -> first day\n        Then 2017-04-20 00:00:00 ... -> second day\n        Then 2017-04-21 ... -> third day\n        Then 2017-04-22 ... -> fourth day (until 23:00:00)\n\n   Total: 24 * 4 = 96 records.\n\n But note: the data provided ends at 2017-04-18 23:00:00, so the next hour is 2017-04-19 00:00:00.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a weekly trend or longer. \n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple linear extrapolation for each hour? But that would require fitting a line to 4 points and then projecting 4 days ahead? That might be too.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics from electricity transformers\" and we are only given HUFL. The load might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have weekly data.\n\n Given the constraints, we choose the average method.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Extract the 4 days of data and arrange by hour of day.\n  2. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n  3. Create a new DataFrame for the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-04-19 00:00:00.\n  4. Assign the HUFL for each hour in the new days by the computed average for that hour.\n\n However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data? But the provided past 96 points are complete. So we don't need to impute for the past.\n\n But what if we are to forecast and the past has missing? The problem says \"be aware of that\", but in this case we are given the past 96 without missing. So we proceed.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 hours and for each hour, we take the values at that hour from each of the 4 days.\n\n   Hour 0 (00:00): [12.726, 10.851, 9.779, 11.655] -> average = (12.726+10.851+9.779+11.655)/4 = 45.011/4 = 11.25275\n   Hour 1 (01:00): [12.257, 11.253, 11.655, 10.315] -> (12.257+11.253+11.655+10.315)=45.48 -> 11.37\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days (96 hours) without gaps.\n\n We can code this in Python, but since we are to output the data, we can compute manually? That would be tedious.\n\n Alternatively, we can write a small code in our mind and compute the averages.\n\n However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must output 96 lines.\n\n We'll compute the 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n   Hour 0: (12.726 + 10.851 + 9.779 + 11.655) / 4 = 45.011 / 4 = 11.25275\n   Hour 1: (12.257 + 11.253 + 11.655 + 10.315) / 4 = 45.48 / 4 = 11.37\n   Hour 2: (12.726 + 11.186 + 9.243 + 10.717) / 4 = 43.872 / 4 = 10.968\n   Hour 3: (12.525 + 9.645 + 9.980 + 10.449) / 4 = 42.599 / 4 = 10.64975\n   Hour 4: (10.516 + 10.784 + 11.253 + 8.105) / 4 = 40.658 / 4 = 10.1645\n   Hour 5: (12.592 + 9.779 + 10.382 + 8.372) / 4 = 41.125 / 4 = 10.28125\n   Hour 6: (13.999 + 12.592 + 13.396 + 8.841) / 4 = 48.828 / 4 = 12.207\n   Hour 7: (9.980 + 9.913 + 9.444 + 6.028) / 4 = 35.365 / 4 = 8.84125\n   Hour 8: (2.210 + 2.478 + 4.421 + -0.067) / 4 = 9.042 / 4 = 2.2605\n   Hour 9: (-7.100 + -4.957 + -0.201 + -6.631) / 4 = -18.889 / 4 = -4.72225\n   Hour10: (-9.846 + -8.306 + -8.372 + -10.382) / 4 = -36.906 / 4 = -9.2265\n   Hour11: (-12.927 + -9.846 + -9.712 + -13.664) / 4 = -46.149 / 4 = -11.53725\n   Hour12: (-15.004 + -12.659 + -17.281 + -16.611) / 4 = -61.555 / 4 = -15.38875\n   Hour13: (-13.932 + -12.458 + -9.511 + -15.606) / 4 = -51.507 / 4 = -12.87675\n   Hour14: (-12.525 + -8.372 + -12.257 + -13.463) / 4 = -46.617 / 4 = -11.65425\n   Hour15: (-8.774 + -3.282 + -7.435 + -7.837) / 4 = -27.328 / 4 = -6.832\n   Hour16: (-5.693 + 5.894 + 0.000 + -1.407) / 4 = (-5.693+5.894=0.201; 0.201+0=0.201; 0.201-1.407=-1.206) -> -1.206/4 = -0.3015\n   Hour17: (1.005 + 5.157 + 2.210 + -0.402) / 4 = (1.005+5.157=6.162; 6.162+2.210=8.372; 8.372-0.402=7.97) -> 7.97/4 = 1.9925\n   Hour18: (6.095 + 6.430 + 5.090 + 5.425) / 4 = 23.04 / 4 = 5.76\n   Hour19: (6.497 + 6.296 + 6.028 + 6.899) / 4 = 25.72 / 4 = 6.43\n   Hour20: (6.765 + 6.564 + 6.698 + 7.502) / 4 = 27.529 / 4 = 6.88225\n   Hour21: (6.430 + 7.368 + 7.167 + 6.564) / 4 = 27.529 / 4 = 6.88225? Wait, let me compute: 6.430+7.368=13.798; 13.798+7.167=20.965; 20.965+6.564=27.529 -> 27.529/4=6.88225\n   Hour22: (7.301 + 8.038 + 7.569 + 8.105) / 4 = 31.013 / 4 = 7.75325\n   Hour23: (9.578 + 8.038 + 10.181 + 7.770) / 4 = 35.567 / 4 = 8.89175\n\n Now, we have 24 values:\n\n   [11.25275, 11.37, 10.968, 10.64975, 10.1645, 10.28125, 12.207, 8.84125, 2.2605, -4.72225, -9.2265, -11.53725, -15.38875, -12.87675, -11.65425, -6.832, -0.3015, 1.9925, 5.76, 6.43, 6.88225, 6.88225, 7.75325, 8.89175]\n\n We then repeat this list 4 times to form the 96 forecasts.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not told that the future will have missing, so we output the 96 values without missing.\n\n However, the problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You must provide the complete data\".\n\n We will generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n   Start: 2017-04-19 00:00:00, then 2017-04-19 01:00:00, ... until 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n   The HUFL values will be:\n\n        2017-04-19 00:00:00: 11.25275\n        2017-04-19 01:00:00: 11.37\n        ... and so on for the first 24 hours (day1 of forecast)\n        then for 2017-04-20 00:00:00: 11.25275 (again the first hour average)\n        and so on.\n\n But note: we computed the average for each hour, so the pattern repeats every 24 hours.\n\n However, we must output the data in the same format as the input, with the same precision? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll round to 3 decimal places? The input data had 3 decimal places. So we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's round:\n\n   Hour0: 11.25275 -> 11.253\n   Hour1: 11.37 -> 11.370 (if we round to 3 decimals, 11.37 is 11.370? But in the input we have 12.726, so we can have 3 decimals)\n\n   Actually, we can compute and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll recalc each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimals by formatting.\n\n   But note: the input has mixed: some have 3, some have 2? Actually, the input:\n\n   2017-04-15 00:00:00  12.726 -> 3\n   2017-04-15 01:00:00  12.257 -> 3\n   ... \n   2017-04-15 08:00:00   2.210 -> 3\n   2017-04-15 09:00:00  -7.100 -> 3? (but only one decimal? Actually, it's written as -7.100, so 3 decimals)\n\n   Actually, the data is given with 3 decimal places.\n\n   So we round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll compute the averages and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Hour0: 11.25275 -> 11.253\n   because 0.25275: the third decimal is 2, and the next digit is 7 which is >=5 -> round up: 11.253\n\n   Let me do:\n\n   Hour0: 45.011 / 4 = 11.25275 -> round to 3 decimals: 11.253\n   Hour1: 45.48 / 4 = 11.37 -> 11.370? But 11.48/4=11.37 -> 11.370? Actually, 45.48/4=11.37 exactly? \n        45.48 / 4 = 11.37 -> but we can write as 11.370 to show 3 decimals? \n        However, in the input, 12.257 has 3 decimals, so we should output 3 decimals.\n\n        But 11.37 is 11.370? We can output 11.370.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output without trailing zeros? The input has 12.726 and 2.210 (which has a trailing zero). So we should output 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll format to 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll recalc and round to 3 decimals:\n\n   Hour0: 11.25275 -> 11.253\n   Hour1: 11.37 -> 11.370 (because 11.37 is 11.370, but when we round 11.37 to 3 decimals, it's 11.370? Actually, 11.37 is already 2 decimals, so we add one zero? \n        we are rounding the average to 3 decimals: 11.37 is 11.370? \n\n   Actually, we are computing the average and then rounding to 3 decimal places. For hour1: 45.48/4 = 11.37 -> which is 11.370 when written to 3 decimals? \n\n   But note: 11.37 is the same as 11.370. So we can output 11.370.\n\n   However, to be consistent, we'll compute the average and then round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let me do the rounding for each:\n\n   Hour0: 11.25275 -> 11.253\n   Hour1: 11.37 -> 11.370? But 11.37 is exactly 11.370? So we can write 11.370.\n\n   Actually, we can use:\n\n        value = round(avg, 3)\n\n   This will give:\n\n        Hour0: round(11.25275, 3) -> 11.253\n        Hour1: round(11.37, 3) -> 11.37 -> but wait, 11.37 is 11.370, and when we round to 3 decimals, it remains 11.370? \n\n   However, in Python, round(11.37, 3) would be 11.37? But that is 2 decimals. We want 3.\n\n   Actually, we should format the number to have 3 decimal places. But the problem does not specify the exact string representation.\n\n   We'll output the numbers with 3 decimal places, so:\n\n        11.37 becomes 11.370\n        11.253 remains 11.253\n\n   How? We can use formatting: \"{:.3f}\".format(x)\n\n   But since we are writing the answer, we can write the numbers with 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can round to 3 decimals and then if it has less, we add zeros? \n\n   However, the problem's example input has:\n\n        12.726, 12.257, 2.210, -7.100\n\n   So we see that -7.100 has three decimals. So we output three decimals.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        For each value, we format to have 3 decimal places.\n\n   But note: negative numbers? We have to be careful.\n\n   We'll compute the averages and then round to 3 decimals, and then format to have 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, to save time, we'll compute and then write the numbers with 3 decimals.\n\n   Let me recalc the averages and round to 3 decimals:\n\n   Hour0: 11.25275 -> 11.253\n   Hour1: 11.37 -> 11.370 (because 11.37 is 11.37000, so we write 11.370)\n        But wait, 11.37 is exactly 11.370? So we can write 11.370.\n\n   However, let's do the calculation: 45.48 / 4 = 11.37 -> which is 11.370 when we write 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        Hour0: 11.253\n        Hour1: 11.370\n        Hour2: 10.968 -> 10.968 (exactly 10.968, so 10.968)\n        Hour3: 10.64975 -> 10.650 (because 0.64975: the third decimal is 9, and the next is 7 so round up the 9 -> becomes 10.650? \n                Actually: 10.64975: \n                    The third decimal is 9, and the next digit is 7 which is >=5 -> so we round up the 9 -> but 9 becomes 10 -> so 10.650\n        Hour4: 10.1645 -> 10.1645: third decimal is 4, next is 5 -> round up: 10.165\n        Hour5: 10.28125 -> 10.281 (because 1 is the third decimal, next is 2 which is <5 -> 10.281)\n        Hour6: 12.207 -> 12.207\n        Hour7: 8.84125 -> 8.841\n        Hour8: 2.2605 -> 2.261\n        Hour9: -4.72225 -> -4.722\n        Hour10: -9.2265 -> -9.227 (because 6 is the third decimal, next is 5 -> round up: 6 becomes 7 -> -9.227)\n        Hour11: -11.53725 -> -11.537\n        Hour12: -15.38875 -> -15.389 (because 8 is the third decimal, next is 7 -> round up: 8 becomes 9 -> -15.389)\n        Hour13: -12.87675 -> -12.877 (because 6 is the third decimal, next is 7 -> round up: 6 becomes 7 -> -12.877)\n        Hour14: -11.65425 -> -11.654\n        Hour15: -6.832 -> -6.832\n        Hour16: -0.3015 -> -0.302 (because 1 is the third decimal, next is 5 -> round up: 1 becomes 2 -> -0.302? \n                Actually: -0.3015: the third decimal is 1, and then 5 -> round up: 1 becomes 2 -> -0.302)\n        But note: -0.3015: \n            The number is negative, but rounding is towards the next more negative? \n            Actually, rounding is absolute: 0.3015 rounded to 3 decimals: 0.302 -> so the number becomes -0.302.\n        Hour17: 1.9925 -> 1.993 (because 2 is the third decimal, next is 5 -> round up: 2 becomes 3 -> 1.993)\n        Hour18: 5.76 -> 5.760\n        Hour19: 6.43 -> 6.430\n        Hour20: 6.88225 -> 6.882\n        Hour21: 6.88225 -> 6.882\n        But wait, we computed hour21 as 6.88225? Actually, we had two different sets for hour21? \n            Actually, I see: for hour21 we had: \n                Day1: 6.430\n                Day2: 7.368\n                Day3: 7.167\n                Day4: 6.564\n            Sum: 6.430+7.368=13.798; 13.798+7.167=20.965; 20.965+6.564=27.529 -> 27.529/4=6.88225 -> same as hour20? \n            But hour20: \n                Day1: 6.765\n                Day2: 6.564\n                Day3: 6.698\n                Day4: 7.502\n            Sum: 6.765+6.564=13.329; 13.329+6.698=20.027; 20.027+7.502=27.529 -> same sum? \n            So both hour20 and hour21 have the same average? \n\n        So hour20: 6.88225 -> 6.882 (because 2 is the third decimal, next is 2 which is <5 -> 6.882)\n        hour21: 6.88225 -> 6.882\n\n        Hour22: 7.75325 -> 7.753\n        Hour23: 8.89175 -> 8.892\n\n   So the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals) are:\n\n        [11.253, 11.370, 10.968, 10.650, 10.165, 10.281, 12.207, 8.841, 2.261, -4.722, -9.227, -11.537, -15.389, -12.877, -11.654, -6.832, -0.302, 1.993, 5.760, 6.430, 6.882, 6.882, 7.753, 8.892]\n\n   Now, we create the next 96 hours by repeating this list 4 times.\n\n   The dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-19 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-04-19 01:00:00\n        ...\n        Then 2017-04-19 23:00:00 -> first 24\n        Then 2017-04-20 00:00:00 -> same as 2017-04-19 00:00:00? -> 11.253\n        ... until 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n   We generate the timestamps:\n\n        We start at 2017-04-19 00:00:00 and add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n   We'll write the data in the same format: \n\n        date                  HUFL\n        2017-04-19 00:00:00  11.253\n        2017-04-19 01:00:00  11.370\n        ...\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   We'll write the 4 days: 2017-04-19, 2017-04-20, 2017-04-21, 2017-04-22.\n\n   We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-19 00:00:00 to 2017-04-19 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day2: 2017-04-20 00:00:00 to 2017-04-20 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day3: 2017-04-21 00:00:00 to 2017-04-21 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day4: 2017-04-22 00:00:00 to 2017-04-22 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n\n   Total 96.\n\n   The HUFL values for each day will be the same 24 numbers.\n\n   So:\n\n        Day1: [11.253, 11.370, 10.968, 10.650, 10.165, 10.281, 12.207, 8.841, 2.261, -4.722, -9.227, -11.537, -15.389, -12.877, -11.654, -6.832, -0.302, 1.993, 5.760, 6.430, 6.882, 6.882, 7.753, 8.892]\n        Day2: same list\n        Day3: same list\n        Day4: same list\n\n   We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-04-19 00:00:00  11.253\n2017-04-19 01:00:00  11.370\n2017-04-19 02:00:00  10.968\n2017-04-19 03:00:00  10.650\n2017-04-19 04:00:00  10.165\n2017-04-19 05:00:00  10.281\n2017-04-19 06:00:00  12.207\n2017-04-19 07:00:00  8.841\n2017-04-19 08:00:00  2.261\n2017-04-19 09:00:00  -4.722\n2017-04-19 10:00:00  -9.227\n2017-04-19 11:00:00  -11.537\n2017-04-19 12:00:00  -15.389\n2017-04-19 13:00:00  -12.877\n2017-04-19 14:00:00  -11.654\n2017-04-19 15:00:00  -6.832\n2017-04-19 16:00:00  -0.302\n2017-04-19 17:00:00  1.993\n2017-04-19 18:00:00  5.760\n2017-04-19 19:00:00  6.430\n2017-04-19 20:00:00  6.882\n2017-04-19 21:00:00  6.882\n2017-04-19 22:00:00  7.753\n2017-04-19 23:00:00  8.892\n2017-04-20 00:00:00  11.253\n2017-04-20 01:00:00  11.370\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n   We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we output all 96.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Let's code the answer in the <answer> block.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   We have the 24 values for one day:\n\n        values = [11.253, 11.370, 10.968, 10.650, 10.165, 10.281, 12.207, 8.841, 2.261, -4.722, -9.227, -11.537, -15.389, -12.877, -11.654, -6.832, -0.302, 1.993, 5.760, 6.430, 6.882, 6.882, 7.753, 8.892]\n\n   Then for each day in [19,20,21,22] (April 2017) and for each hour in 0..23, we output:\n\n        \"2017-04-%02d %02d:00:00  value\" \n\n   But note: the day must be 19,20,21,22.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        for day in [19, 20, 21, 22]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = \"2017-04-{:02d} {:02d}:00:00\".format(day, hour)\n                value = values[hour]\n                line = f\"{date_str}  {value:.3f}\"\n\n   But note: the value is already rounded to 3 decimals?
