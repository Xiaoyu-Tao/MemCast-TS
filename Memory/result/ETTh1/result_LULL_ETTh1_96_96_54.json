        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any missing value in the given segment.\n    However, the problem states that the dataset may have missing values. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we assume that for forecasting we can use this as a complete series.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a suitable time series forecasting method. Given the data is at hourly intervals, we might consider:\n    - Seasonality: There appears to be daily patterns (24-hour cycles). We can observe that the load is lower at night and higher during the day.\n\n 4. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple seasonal periods: 4 days of 24 hours each) and the data is univariate, \n    we can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short series for fitting a seasonal model with a seasonality of 24. \n    We might have to use a simpler model or use a model that can handle short series.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: \n    - Since the data shows a daily pattern, we can use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    For example, for the next day (2017-02-06) at 00:00:00, we take the average of the LULL at 00:00:00 on 2017-02-02, 2017-02-03, 2017-02-04, and 2017-02-05.\n\n 7. But note: the data for 2017-02-04 09:00:00 is 0.183, which is an outlier? It is significantly lower than the surrounding points. \n    However, without more context, we will treat it as a valid point.\n\n 8. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have exactly 4 days of data, we can use the \"seasonal naive\" method for each hour. \n    But we don't have multiple seasons? Actually, we have 4 days so we have 4 observations for each hour of the day.\n\n 9. We can compute the forecast for each hour of the day by taking the average of the same hour from the past 4 days.\n\n    Let H be the hour (0 to 23). For each hour H in the next 96 hours (which are 4 days: 2017-02-06, 2017-02-07, 2017-02-08, 2017-02-09), \n    we compute:\n\n        forecast(H) = (LULL of day1 at H + LULL of day2 at H + LULL of day3 at H + LULL of day4 at H) / 4\n\n    However, note that the first day in our data is 2017-02-02 (Thursday) and we are forecasting for 2017-02-06 (Monday) to 2017-02-09 (Thursday). \n    There might be weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and we are forecasting Monday to Thursday? \n    We don't have data for Monday in the history. So we are using the same hour from the past 4 days without regard to the day of week.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-02-05) as the pattern for the next days? But that would be a naive seasonal with period 24, \n     but we have 4 days so we can average to smooth.\n\n 11. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n 12. Steps for generating the next 96 hours:\n\n      - The next date starts at 2017-02-06 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n      - For each hour H in [0, 23] for each day in the next 4 days:\n\n          Let:\n            day1 = 2017-02-02 (Thursday) at hour H\n            day2 = 2017-02-03 (Friday) at hour H\n            day3 = 2017-02-04 (Saturday) at hour H\n            day4 = 2017-02-05 (Sunday) at hour H\n\n          Then, forecast for any day at hour H = (day1 + day2 + day3 + day4) / 4\n\n      - We do this for H=0 to 23 for the 4 days (so 4*24=96 points).\n\n 13. However, note that the data for 2017-02-04 09:00:00 is 0.183, which is an anomaly? \n     But we are not instructed to clean the data, so we use it as is.\n\n 14. Let's calculate an example for 00:00:00:\n\n        Day1 (02-02 00:00): 0.426\n        Day2 (02-03 00:00): 0.426\n        Day3 (02-04 00:00): 0.457\n        Day4 (02-05 00:00): 0.426\n\n        Average = (0.426 + 0.426 + 0.457 + 0.426) / 4 = 1.735 / 4 = 0.43375\n\n     We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input? The input has 3 decimal places.\n\n 15. We'll generate the entire forecast by iterating over the 24 hours (0 to 23) for the next 4 days.\n\n 16. The dates for the forecast:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-06 (Monday) from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-02-07 (Tuesday)\n        Day 3: 2017-02-08 (Wednesday)\n        Day 4: 2017-02-09 (Thursday)\n\n 17. We must output the data in the same structure: a list of dates (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS') and the forecasted LULL value.\n\n 18. Since the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we assume the forecast is based on the given 96 points.\n\n 19. We'll write a small program in our mind to compute the averages for each hour.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    Let's index the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and then for each of the 4 days we have:\n\n        hour0: [0.426, 0.426, 0.457, 0.426] -> 0.43375 -> 0.434\n        hour1: [0.396, 0.426, 0.426, 0.426] -> (0.396+0.426+0.426+0.426)/4 = 1.674/4 = 0.4185 -> 0.419\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. We'll compute the average for each hour and then assign that average to the same hour in each of the next 4 days? \n     But note: the pattern might change by day of week? However, we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality. \n     We are using the same value for each day? Actually, we are using the same average for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? \n     But our history includes Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. \n\n 21. Since we don't have data for Monday, we are using an average of the four days we have. This might not be ideal, but with only 4 days, it's the best we can do.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we could use the average of the same day of the week? But we don't have multiple Mondays. So we stick to the average by hour.\n\n 23. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n 24. Then, for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-02-06): hour0, hour1, ... hour23 -> using the computed averages for each hour.\n        Day 2 (2017-02-07): same set of averages (because we don't have a different pattern for Tuesday)\n        Day 3 (2017-02-08): same\n        Day 4 (2017-02-09): same\n\n 25. This means the forecast for each day will be identical? But that might not be the case if we had more data. However, with the method we are using, \n     will be the same for each day. \n\n 26. Alternatively, we could use a moving window? But we are not doing that. We are just averaging the same hour from the 4 days.\n\n 27. Let's do the calculation for each hour.\n\n 28. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) with the 4 values from the 4 days.\n\n 29. Example for hour 9 (09:00:00):\n\n        Day1 (02-02 09:00): 0.487\n        Day2 (02-03 09:00): 0.457\n        Day3 (02-04 09:00): 0.183   -> note: this is an outlier? but we use it.\n        Day4 (02-05 09:00): 0.518\n\n        Average = (0.487 + 0.457 + 0.183 + 0.518) / 4 = 1.645 / 4 = 0.41125 -> 0.411\n\n 30. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 31. Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24 averages in order.\n\n 32. The forecast for 2017-02-06 00:00:00: average of hour0 = 0.434\n        2017-02-06 01:00:00: average of hour1 = 0.419\n        ... until 2017-02-06 23:00:00: average of hour23 = ?\n\n 33. Then 2017-02-07 00:00:00: same as 2017-02-06 00:00:00? Actually, we use the same set of averages for each day. \n     So 2017-02-07 00:00:00 will be the same as 2017-02-06 00:00:00? But that is the average for hour0? \n     Actually, no: for 2017-02-07 00:00:00, we use the average for hour0 again? \n\n     But note: the pattern is for the same hour of the day. So every day at 00:00:00 we use the same average (0.434). \n     every day at 01:00:00 we use 0.419, etc.\n\n 34. Therefore, the forecast for the next 4 days will be 4 identical cycles of the 24-hour average pattern.\n\n 35. We must compute the 24 averages.\n\n 36. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n    Hour 0: [0.426, 0.426, 0.457, 0.426] -> (0.426+0.426+0.457+0.426)/4 = 1.735/4 = 0.43375 -> 0.434\n    Hour 1: [0.396, 0.426, 0.426, 0.426] -> (0.396+0.426+0.426+0.426)=1.674/4=0.4185 -> 0.419\n    Hour 2: [0.396, 0.426, 0.426, 0.396] -> (0.396+0.426+0.426+0.396)=1.644/4=0.411 -> 0.411\n    Hour 3: [0.335, 0.366, 0.426, 0.426] -> (0.335+0.366+0.426+0.426)=1.553/4=0.38825 -> 0.388\n    Hour 4: [0.366, 0.579, 0.366, 0.335] -> (0.366+0.579+0.366+0.335)=1.646/4=0.4115 -> 0.412\n    Hour 5: [0.396, 0.335, 0.366, 0.335] -> (0.396+0.335+0.366+0.335)=1.432/4=0.358 -> 0.358\n    Hour 6: [0.366, 0.335, 0.335, 0.396] -> (0.366+0.335+0.335+0.396)=1.432/4=0.358 -> 0.358\n    Hour 7: [0.426, 0.426, 0.396, 0.426] -> (0.426+0.426+0.396+0.426)=1.674/4=0.4185 -> 0.419\n    Hour 8: [0.426, 0.426, 0.487, 0.426] -> (0.426+0.426+0.487+0.426)=1.765/4=0.44125 -> 0.441\n    Hour 9: [0.487, 0.457, 0.183, 0.518] -> (0.487+0.457+0.183+0.518)=1.645/4=0.41125 -> 0.411\n    Hour 10: [0.457, 0.457, 0.548, 0.487] -> (0.457+0.457+0.548+0.487)=1.949/4=0.48725 -> 0.487\n    Hour 11: [0.487, 0.457, 0.457, 0.487] -> (0.487+0.457+0.457+0.487)=1.888/4=0.472 -> 0.472\n    Hour 12: [0.487, 0.457, 0.457, 0.548] -> (0.487+0.457+0.457+0.548)=1.949/4=0.48725 -> 0.487\n    Hour 13: [0.487, 0.457, 0.457, 0.579] -> (0.487+0.457+0.457+0.579)=1.98/4=0.495 -> 0.495\n    Hour 14: [0.487, 0.457, 0.426, 0.548] -> (0.487+0.457+0.426+0.548)=1.918/4=0.4795 -> 0.480\n    Hour 15: [0.518, 0.457, 0.457, 0.548] -> (0.518+0.457+0.457+0.548)=1.98/4=0.495 -> 0.495\n    Hour 16: [0.518, 0.518, 0.426, 0.487] -> (0.518+0.518+0.426+0.487)=1.949/4=0.48725 -> 0.487\n    Hour 17: [0.426, 0.518, 0.457, 0.457] -> (0.426+0.518+0.457+0.457)=1.858/4=0.4645 -> 0.465\n    Hour 18: [0.426, 0.487, 0.457, 0.457] -> (0.426+0.487+0.457+0.457)=1.827/4=0.45675 -> 0.457\n    Hour 19: [0.518, 0.548, 0.487, 0.548] -> (0.518+0.548+0.487+0.548)=2.101/4=0.52525 -> 0.525\n    Hour 20: [0.487, 0.579, 0.457, 0.640] -> (0.487+0.579+0.457+0.640)=2.163/4=0.54075 -> 0.541\n    Hour 21: [0.548, 0.518, 0.457, 0.518] -> (0.548+0.518+0.457+0.518)=2.041/4=0.51025 -> 0.510\n    Hour 22: [0.487, 0.518, 0.457, 0.487] -> (0.487+0.518+0.457+0.487)=1.949/4=0.48725 -> 0.487\n    Hour 23: [0.457, 0.457, 0.457, 0.487] -> (0.457+0.457+0.457+0.487)=1.858/4=0.4645 -> 0.465\n\n 37. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-06 \n           00:00:00 -> 0.434\n           01:00:00 -> 0.419\n           02:00:00 -> 0.411\n           03:00:00 -> 0.388\n           04:00:00 -> 0.412\n           05:00:00 -> 0.358\n           06:00:00 -> 0.358\n           07:00:00 -> 0.419\n           08:00:00 -> 0.441\n           09:00:00 -> 0.411\n           10:00:00 -> 0.487\n           11:00:00 -> 0.472\n           12:00:00 -> 0.487\n           13:00:00 -> 0.495\n           14:00:00 -> 0.480\n           15:00:00 -> 0.495\n           16:00:00 -> 0.487\n           17:00:00 -> 0.465\n           18:00:00 -> 0.457\n           19:00:00 -> 0.525\n           20:00:00 -> 0.541\n           21:00:00 -> 0.510\n           22:00:00 -> 0.487\n           23:00:00 -> 0.465\n\n        Day2: 2017-02-07: same 24 values in the same order.\n\n        Day3: 2017-02-08: same.\n\n        Day4: 2017-02-09: same.\n\n 38. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 39. We note that the dates must be generated as:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-06 00:00:00\n        Then add one hour until 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n 40.
