        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided 96 points do not have any missing values? But the problem says the data will have missing values. However, in the provided data, there are no missing values. So we assume that the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We note that the data is hourly.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we need to generate 96 rows of data with the timestamp and the forecasted HULL value.\n\n 4. Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we can proceed to model the time series and forecast.\n\n 5. We note that the data has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can see that the values drop during the night and rise during the day? But looking at the data, it's not very clear. However, we can try to use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 6. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need for 96 forecasts, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 7. We choose to use the Seasonal ARIMA model because it is suitable for data with seasonality and trends.\n\n 8. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We have to determine the order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,s). The seasonality period s is 24 (for daily seasonality in hourly data).\n    - We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters? But since we are not allowed to run code, we have to rely on typical patterns.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like a seasonal naive model, but that might not capture the trend.\n\n 10. However, note that the problem does not require a specific model, just the forecast. We are to provide the next 96 points.\n\n 11. Given the constraints, we will use a model that we can reason about. But without running actual code, we have to simulate the process.\n\n 12. Since we cannot run code, we have to make an educated guess. But the problem expects a complete set of 96 forecasted values.\n\n 13. Another idea: use the last 96 points and shift the pattern? But the data might have a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days, so we cannot see weekly. So we can assume daily seasonality.\n\n 14. We can use the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that to forecast the next 4 days? But we have to account for any trend? The data does not show a clear trend.\n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have:\n\n     Hour 0: (5.157 + 4.287 + 4.019 + 5.023) / 4 = 18.486 / 4 = 4.6215\n     Hour 1: (6.564 + 4.086 + 3.751 + 5.492) / 4 = 19.893 / 4 = 4.97325\n     ... and so on.\n\n 16. But note: the data might have a strong daily pattern? Let's check:\n\n     We see that the values at the same hour of the day are not very consistent. For example, at hour 0: 5.157, 4.287, 4.019, 5.023 -> so averaging might be reasonable.\n\n 17. However, we have only 4 days, so the average might be noisy.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-03) as the pattern for the next days? But the problem says \"High UseLess Load\", and we don't know if there is a weekly pattern (like weekends) but we only have 4 days from Thursday to Sunday? \n\n    2016-11-30: Thursday\n    2016-12-01: Friday\n    2016-12-02: Saturday\n    2016-12-03: Sunday\n\n    So the next 96 hours would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? (from 2016-12-04 to 2016-12-07). We don't have data for Monday? So we cannot rely on the same day of the week.\n\n 19. Given the complexity and without a clear model, we decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form the daily profile, and then use that to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 20. We calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n 21. Then we repeat that average for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 22. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can use the provided data as is.\n\n 23. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n     hour0: (5.157 + 4.287 + 4.019 + 5.023) / 4 = 4.6215\n     hour1: (6.564 + 4.086 + 3.751 + 5.492) / 4 = 4.97325\n     hour2: (5.626 + 4.555 + 3.952 + 4.890) / 4 = 4.75575\n     hour3: (5.760 + 4.220 + 3.952 + 5.157) / 4 = 4.77225\n     hour4: (5.626 + 3.885 + 2.947 + 4.890) / 4 = 4.337\n     hour5: (6.765 + 4.421 + 4.756 + 3.684) / 4 = 4.9065\n     hour6: (4.689 + 2.880 + 4.555 + 1.875) / 4 = 3.49975\n     hour7: (5.157 + 3.818 + 4.421 + 3.684) / 4 = 4.27\n     hour8: (4.890 + 3.684 + 3.349 + 4.220) / 4 = 4.03575\n     hour9: (3.952 + 3.885 + 3.617 + 2.143) / 4 = 3.39925\n     hour10: (3.349 + 4.019 + 3.282 + 3.416) / 4 = 3.5165\n     hour11: (3.952 + 4.019 + 3.416 + 2.746) / 4 = 3.53325\n     hour12: (2.411 + 2.009 + 2.344 + 1.741) / 4 = 2.12625\n     hour13: (3.215 + 3.148 + 2.478 + 3.081) / 4 = 2.9805\n     hour14: (3.416 + 3.952 + 3.751 + 3.952) / 4 = 3.76775\n     hour15: (3.148 + 3.952 + 3.349 + 3.751) / 4 = 3.55\n     hour16: (3.751 + 3.818 + 3.282 + 3.282) / 4 = 3.53325\n     hour17: (3.282 + 2.947 + 2.612 + 2.612) / 4 = 2.86325\n     hour18: (2.947 + 0.938 + 2.076 + 1.808) / 4 = 1.94225\n     hour19: (2.746 + 1.005 + 2.009 + 1.674) / 4 = 1.8585\n     hour20: (2.746 + 1.206 + 2.009 + 1.407) / 4 = 1.842\n     hour21: (2.545 + 0.737 + 1.005 + 0.268) / 4 = 1.13875\n     hour22: (2.009 + 2.076 + 3.215 + 2.746) / 4 = 2.5115\n     hour23: (2.947 + 3.483 + 4.488 + 3.617) / 4 = 3.63375\n\n 24. Now, we will use these 24 hourly averages to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours). The next day after 2016-12-03 is 2016-12-04 (Monday) and then 2016-12-05, 2016-12-06, 2016-12-07.\n\n 25. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n    2016-12-04 00:00:00 -> hour0: 4.6215\n    2016-12-04 01:00:00 -> hour1: 4.97325\n    ... until hour23: 3.63375\n\n    Then 2016-12-05 00:00:00 -> hour0: 4.6215\n    ... and so on.\n\n 26. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data. Since we are generating the forecast without gaps, we are providing complete data.\n\n 27. However, this method does not account for any trend or possible changes. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 28. We must output the data in the same format, with the date and the HULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 29. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n    Start from: 2016-12-04 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-12-03 23:00:00)\n    Then 2016-12-04 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We assign the corresponding average for the hour of the day.\n\n 31. We output the data in the format:\n\n        date  HULL\n        2016-12-04 00:00:00 4.622   (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        2016-12-04 01:00:00 4.973\n        ...\n\n 32. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. Let's create the list:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-12-04):\n        00:00:00 -> 4.6215 -> 4.622\n        01:00:00 -> 4.97325 -> 4.973\n        02:00:00 -> 4.75575 -> 4.756\n        03:00:00 -> 4.77225 -> 4.772\n        04:00:00 -> 4.337 -> 4.337\n        05:00:00 -> 4.9065 -> 4.907\n        06:00:00 -> 3.49975 -> 3.500\n        07:00:00 -> 4.27 -> 4.270\n        08:00:00 -> 4.03575 -> 4.036\n        09:00:00 -> 3.39925 -> 3.399\n        10:00:00 -> 3.5165 -> 3.517\n        11:00:00 -> 3.53325 -> 3.533\n        12:00:00 -> 2.12625 -> 2.126\n        13:00:00 -> 2.9805 -> 2.981\n        14:00:00 -> 3.76775 -> 3.768\n        15:00:00 -> 3.55 -> 3.550\n        16:00:00 -> 3.53325 -> 3.533\n        17:00:00 -> 2.86325 -> 2.863\n        18:00:00 -> 1.94225 -> 1.942\n        19:00:00 -> 1.8585 -> 1.859\n        20:00:00 -> 1.842 -> 1.842\n        21:00:00 -> 1.13875 -> 1.139\n        22:00:00 -> 2.5115 -> 2.512\n        23:00:00 -> 3.63375 -> 3.634\n\n    Then repeat the same for the next 3 days (2016-12-05, 2016-12-06, 2016-12-07).\n\n 34. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 35. Note: We are aware that this is a simple method and might not be the most accurate, but given the constraints, it is a feasible approach.\n\n 36. We output the data in the required format.\n\n Let's write the data for the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours) using the above averages.\n",
