        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a method for forecasting. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days) and we have hourly data, we can consider time series methods that capture daily seasonality (seasonality of 24 hours).\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the need for robustness, we can use a model that handles seasonality and potential non-stationarity. One common approach is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing State Space Model with seasonality (ETS) or even a simple seasonal naive method.\n\n 4. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) to forecast the next 96 points. This is a very short history. Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we might consider:\n    - The seasonal component: the data shows a daily pattern? Let's observe:\n        The data: \n          2016-08-02: starts at 22.3, drops to 16.0 at 07:00, then rises to 15.0 at 23:00.\n          2016-08-03: similar pattern? starts at 14.6, drops to 6.6 at 08:00, then rises to 8.5 at 23:00? \n        But the pattern is not very clear because the values on 2016-08-03 are much lower than 2016-08-02.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Since we have only 4 days, we can take the average of the same hour from the previous 4 days? But we only have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days (96 hours) and we are to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    We can do:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) of day 5 (2016-08-06) to day 8 (2016-08-09):\n            Let the forecast for hour h of day d (where d=5,6,7,8) be the average of the same hour h from the previous 4 days (days 1,2,3,4: \n            i.e., for 2016-08-06 00:00:00 (which is the first hour of day 5) we take the average of:\n                2016-08-02 00:00:00 -> 22.304001\n                2016-08-03 00:00:00 -> 14.669000\n                2016-08-04 00:00:00 -> 9.444000\n                2016-08-05 00:00:00 -> 13.798000\n\n            Then for 2016-08-06 01:00:00, average of 2016-08-02 01:00:00, 2016-08-03 01:00:00, ... and so on.\n\n 7. However, note that the data shows a downward trend? Let's see the first day (Aug 2) has higher values than the next days. So taking a simple average might be too low for the first day of forecast? But we don't have a long history to capture trend.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the last day (Aug 5) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might be complex.\n\n 9. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a forecast, and the short history, we choose the average by hour method.\n\n 10. Steps for the average by hour:\n        We have 4 days: \n            Day1: 2016-08-02 (index 0 to 23)\n            Day2: 2016-08-03 (index 24 to 47)\n            Day3: 2016-08-04 (index 48 to 71)\n            Day4: 2016-08-05 (index 72 to 95)\n\n        For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute:\n            avg_hour] = (value[hour] + value[24+hour] + value[48+hour] + value[72+hour]) / 4\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n            Day5 (2016-08-06): [avg_0, avg_1, ... , avg_23]\n            Day6 (2016-08-07): same as Day5? But we can use the same pattern? \n            However, note: we are to forecast 4 days. We can use the same set of averages for each of the next 4 days? \n\n        But wait: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data (only 4 days). So we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we assume that the pattern is daily and the same for the next 4 days.\n\n        So we will repeat the same daily pattern (the computed average for each hour) for 4 days.\n\n 11. However, note: the data provided does not show a clear consistent pattern? The values on the first day are higher than the subsequent days. Therefore, if we average, the forecast will be lower than the first day but higher than the last day? \n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n 13. We'll stick to the simple average by hour for the 4 days and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (22.304001 + 14.669000 + 9.444000 + 13.798000) / 4 = (22.304001+14.669000+9.444000+13.798000)=60.215001 /4 = 15.05375025\n        hour1: (20.830999 + 13.798000 + 9.042000 + 11.655000) / 4 = (20.830999+13.798000+9.042000+11.655000)=55.325999 /4 = 13.83149975\n        ... and so on.\n\n 16. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 17. Then the forecast for:\n        2016-08-06 00:00:00: hour0_avg\n        2016-08-06 01:00:00: hour1_avg\n        ...\n        2016-08-06 23:00:00: hour23_avg\n        2016-08-07 00:00:00: hour0_avg\n        ... until 2016-08-09 23:00:00: hour23_avg\n\n 18. We must generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2016-08-06 00:00:00.\n\n 19. The last date in the given data is 2016-08-05 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-08-06 00:00:00.\n\n 20. We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours.\n\n 21. We'll compute the 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times).\n\n 22. Let's do the computation:\n\n        hour0: (22.304001 + 14.669000 + 9.444000 + 13.798000) / 4 = 60.215001 / 4 = 15.05375025\n        hour1: (20.830999 + 13.798000 + 9.042000 + 11.655000) / 4 = 55.325999 / 4 = 13.83149975\n        hour2: (21.299999 + 9.578000 + 8.439000 + 13.865000) / 4 = 53.181999 / 4 = 13.29549975\n        hour3: (19.290001 + 9.377000 + 8.239000 + 11.454000) / 4 = 48.360001 / 4 = 12.09000025\n        hour4: (19.089001 + 9.578000 + 7.904000 + 13.396000) / 4 = 49.967001 / 4 = 12.49175025\n        hour5: (18.419001 + 8.372000 + 8.306000 + 12.123000) / 4 = 47.220001 / 4 = 11.80500025\n        hour6: (16.611000 + 9.913000 + 8.774000 + 14.267000) / 4 = 49.565000 / 4 = 12.39125\n        hour7: (16.075001 + 9.779000 + 8.640000 + 13.463000) / 4 = 47.957001 / 4 = 11.98925025\n        hour8: (13.262000 + 6.631000 + 8.707000 + 10.851000) / 4 = 39.451000 / 4 = 9.86275\n        hour9: (12.659000 + 6.966000 + 9.109000 + 9.980000) / 4 = 38.714000 / 4 = 9.6785\n        hour10: (13.463000 + 4.622000 + 10.851000 + 11.119000) / 4 = 40.055000 / 4 = 10.01375\n        hour11: (14.267000 + 3.014000 + 8.908000 + 10.985000) / 4 = 37.174000 / 4 = 9.2935\n        hour12: (14.803000 + 2.277000 + 8.239000 + 8.239000) / 4 = 33.558000 / 4 = 8.3895\n        hour13: (14.468000 + 2.411000 + 8.105000 + 9.042000) / 4 = 34.026000 / 4 = 8.5065\n        hour14: (12.056000 + 2.545000 + 7.435000 + 8.908000) / 4 = 30.944000 / 4 = 7.736\n        hour15: (11.186000 + 2.277000 + 8.105000 + 9.042000) / 4 = 30.610000 / 4 = 7.6525\n        hour16: (10.449000 + 5.358000 + 7.636000 + 8.439000) / 4 = 31.882000 / 4 = 7.9705\n        hour17: (10.985000 + 8.640000 + 8.306000 + 9.243000) / 4 = 37.174000 / 4 = 9.2935\n        hour18: (8.640000 + 8.439000 + 8.239000 + 8.239000) / 4 = 33.557000 / 4 = 8.38925\n        hour19: (9.511000 + 8.172000 + 8.105000 + 8.038000) / 4 = 33.826000 / 4 = 8.4565\n        hour20: (12.994000 + 10.650000 + 10.918000 + 10.516000) / 4 = 45.078000 / 4 = 11.2695\n        hour21: (11.588000 + 9.243000 + 9.980000 + 9.377000) / 4 = 40.188000 / 4 = 10.047\n        hour22: (12.659000 + 8.707000 + 10.784000 + 11.253000) / 4 = 43.403000 / 4 = 10.85075\n        hour23: (15.004000 + 8.573000 + 12.525000 + 12.525000) / 4 = 48.627000 / 4 = 12.15675\n\n 23. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1 (2016-08-06): \n            00:00:00 -> 15.05375025\n            01:00:00 -> 13.83149975\n            02:00:00 -> 13.29549975\n            03:00:00 -> 12.09000025\n            04:00:00 -> 12.49175025\n            05:00:00 -> 11.80500025\n            06:00:00 -> 12.39125\n            07:00:00 -> 11.98925025\n            08:00:00 -> 9.86275\n            09:00:00 -> 9.6785\n            10:00:00 -> 10.01375\n            11:00:00 -> 9.2935\n            12:00:00 -> 8.3895\n            13:00:00 -> 8.5065\n            14:00:00 -> 7.736\n            15:00:00 -> 7.6525\n            16:00:00 -> 7.9705\n            17:00:00 -> 9.2935\n            18:00:00 -> 8.38925\n            19:00:00 -> 8.4565\n            20:00:00 -> 11.2695\n            21:00:00 -> 10.047\n            22:00:00 -> 10.85075\n            23:00:00 -> 12.15675\n\n        Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 24. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values? We are not given any in the history, so we assume the history is complete. And we are forecasting without missing values? The problem says \"be aware of that\", but we are not told to impute the history. We are only to forecast the next 96. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96.\n\n 25. We'll output the forecast in the same format as the input, with the date and the HUFL value.\n\n 26. We must format the numbers to 6 decimal places? The input had 6 decimal places. But note the input had up to 3 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 decimal places but stored as floats. We'll output with 6 decimal places to match the format? But the example had 3 decimal places. However, the example also had 6 digits after the decimal? Actually, the example has 22.304001 -> 6 decimal places. So we output 6 decimal places.\n\n 27. We'll round to 6 decimal places.\n\n 28. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-06 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-08-06 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-09 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 30. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 31. Code for the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 8,6,0,0,0)\n        dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 32. But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n 33. We'll write the forecasted values for the 96 hours.\n\n 34. We have the 24 averages as a list:\n\n        avg = [15.05375025, 13.83149975, 13.29549975, 12.09000025, 12.49175025, 11.80500025, 12.39125, 11.98925025, 9.86275, 9.6785, 10.01375, 9.2935, 8.3895, 8.5065, 7.736, 7.6525, 7.9705, 9.2935, 8.38925, 8.4565, 11.2695, 10.047, 10.85075, 12.15675]\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 35. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-06 00:00:00 15.053750\n2016-08-06 01:00:00 13.831500\n2016-08-06 02:00:00 13.295500\n... \n        </answer>\n\n 36. We round each value to 6 decimal places.\n\n 37. Let's do the rounding:\n\n        [round(x, 6) for x in avg]\n\n        But note: the example had 22.304001 -> 6 decimal places.\n\n 38. We'll write the full 96 lines.\n\n 39. We note: the first day of forecast: 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-06 23:00:00 -> uses avg[0] to avg[23]\n        second day: 2016-08-07 00:00:00 to 2016-08-07 23:00:00 -> same avg[0] to avg[23]\n        third day: 2016-08-08 00:00:00 to 2016-08-08 23:00:00 -> same\n        fourth day: 2016-08-09 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00 -> same\n\n 40. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 41. We write the output.\n\n 42. We must be cautious: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 43.
