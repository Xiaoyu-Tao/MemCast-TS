        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might have missing values. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we will use the given 96 points as a complete series.\n\n 3. We need to choose a forecasting method. Given the hourly data, we might expect:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours) but we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly. Therefore, we focus on daily.\n\n 4. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast the next 4 days, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any) and daily seasonality.\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal autoregressive model (SARIMA) or exponential smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 4 days, we have limited data for training.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Calculate the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend.\n\n 7. However, looking at the data, there is a slight upward trend? Let's check the first day and the last day:\n    - 2017-10-12: min=2.673, max=7.879\n    - 2017-10-13: min=7.175, max=10.060\n    - 2017-10-14: min=4.924, max=8.582 -> note the drop at 04:00 to 4.924, but then it goes up again.\n    - 2017-10-15: min=6.120, max=8.442\n\n    The data does not show a clear overall trend. There are fluctuations.\n\n 8. Given the short history, we might use a naive seasonal method: the last available day (i.e., 2017-10-15) as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    But that would be 4 copies of 2017-10-15. However, we note that the data from 2017-10-12 to 2017-10-15 are consecutive days and we see some variation.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the 4 days for each hour. But note that the data on 2017-10-14 at 04:00:00 is 4.924 which is an outlier? \n    We can try to use the median for each hour to avoid the effect of outliers.\n\n 10. Steps for the median method:\n      - Group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the median of the 4 days for that hour.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (2017-10-16 to 2017-10-19), we use the median for each hour.\n\n 11. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the given 96 points, we don't have missing values, so we can compute the median for each hour.\n\n 12. However, we must consider that the median method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a model like ExponentialSmoothing with trend and seasonality. But with 4 days, the model might not be stable.\n\n 14. Given the constraints, we choose the median method for simplicity and robustness.\n\n 15. How to handle the dates for the next 96 hours?\n      - The last date in the input is 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n      - The next 96 hours will be from 2017-10-16 00:00:00 to 2017-10-19 23:00:00.\n\n 16. Steps:\n      a. Extract the hour from the time (e.g., 00:00:00, 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00).\n      b. Group the 96 points by the hour (ignoring the date) and compute the median for each hour.\n      c. Then, for the next 4 days, we assign the median value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 17. Example for 2017-10-16 00:00:00: take the median of the values at 00:00:00 from the 4 days (2017-10-12, 2017-10-13, 2017-10-14, 2017-10-15).\n\n 18. Let's compute the medians:\n\n      Hour 00:00:00: [6.613, 7.668, 8.160, 7.457] -> sorted: [6.613, 7.457, 7.668, 8.160] -> median = (7.457+7.668)/2 = 7.5625\n      Hour 01:00:00: [4.432, 7.738, 8.020, 7.527] -> sorted: [4.432, 7.527, 7.738, 8.020] -> median = (7.527+7.738)/2 = 7.6325\n      ... and so on.\n\n 19. However, note that the data on 2017-10-14 at 04:00:00 is 4.924, which is much lower than the others at 04:00:00. \n      The other days at 04:00:00: \n          2017-10-12: 3.658\n          2017-10-13: 7.175\n          2017-10-15: 6.824\n      So for 04:00:00: [3.658, 7.175, 4.924, 6.824] -> sorted: [3.658, 4.924, 6.824, 7.175] -> median = (4.924+6.824)/2 = 5.874\n\n 20. We'll compute the median for each hour and then repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 21. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the given 96 points, we don't have any missing, so we can compute the median for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 22. We'll create a list of 24 median values (for hours 0 to 23).\n\n 23. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours), we assign:\n        Day 1 (2017-10-16): medians for hour 0,1,...,23\n        Day 2 (2017-10-17): medians for hour 0,1,...,23\n        Day 3 (2017-10-18): medians for hour 0,1,...,23\n        Day 4 (2017-10-19): medians for hour 0,1,...,23\n\n 24. We must generate the dates as well.\n\n 25. Implementation in code (but we are to output the data in the required format).\n\n 26. Let's compute the medians for each hour:\n\n      We'll create a dictionary or list for each hour index (0 to 23) and collect the values.\n\n      Hour 0 (00:00:00): [6.613, 7.668, 8.160, 7.457] -> median = 7.5625\n      Hour 1 (01:00:00): [4.432, 7.738, 8.020, 7.527] -> median = 7.6325\n      Hour 2 (02:00:00): [5.346, 7.316, 7.879, 7.386] -> sorted: [5.346, 7.316, 7.386, 7.879] -> median = (7.316+7.386)/2 = 7.351\n      Hour 3 (03:00:00): [3.236, 7.527, 8.090, 7.457] -> sorted: [3.236, 7.457, 7.527, 8.090] -> median = (7.457+7.527)/2 = 7.492\n      Hour 4 (04:00:00): [3.658, 7.175, 4.924, 6.824] -> sorted: [3.658, 4.924, 6.824, 7.175] -> median = (4.924+6.824)/2 = 5.874\n      Hour 5 (05:00:00): [3.025, 7.457, 6.261, 6.331] -> sorted: [3.025, 6.261, 6.331, 7.457] -> median = (6.261+6.331)/2 = 6.296\n      Hour 6 (06:00:00): [2.673, 7.316, 6.402, 6.542] -> sorted: [2.673, 6.402, 6.542, 7.316] -> median = (6.402+6.542)/2 = 6.472\n      Hour 7 (07:00:00): [2.744, 6.964, 7.246, 6.542] -> sorted: [2.744, 6.542, 6.964, 7.246] -> median = (6.542+6.964)/2 = 6.753\n      Hour 8 (08:00:00): [4.362, 7.316, 7.809, 6.472] -> sorted: [4.362, 6.472, 7.316, 7.809] -> median = (6.472+7.316)/2 = 6.894\n      Hour 9 (09:00:00): [3.517, 7.386, 7.668, 6.542] -> sorted: [3.517, 6.542, 7.386, 7.668] -> median = (6.542+7.386)/2 = 6.964\n      Hour 10 (10:00:00): [4.502, 7.457, 8.160, 6.120] -> sorted: [4.502, 6.120, 7.457, 8.160] -> median = (6.120+7.457)/2 = 6.7885\n      Hour 11 (11:00:00): [4.502, 8.301, 8.301, 7.246] -> Note: the data for 2017-10-12 11:00:00 is 4.502, 2017-10-13 11:00:00 is 8.301, 2017-10-14 11:00:00 is 8.301, 2017-10-15 11:00:00 is 7.246 -> sorted: [4.502, 7.246, 8.301, 8.301] -> median = (7.246+8.301)/2 = 7.7735\n      Hour 12 (12:00:00): [4.502, 8.160, 8.020, 7.316] -> sorted: [4.502, 7.316, 8.020, 8.160] -> median = (7.316+8.020)/2 = 7.668\n      Hour 13 (13:00:00): [6.824, 8.653, 8.512, 8.371] -> sorted: [6.824, 8.371, 8.512, 8.653] -> median = (8.371+8.512)/2 = 8.4415\n      Hour 14 (14:00:00): [5.487, 9.286, 8.582, 8.442] -> sorted: [5.487, 8.442, 8.582, 9.286] -> median = (8.442+8.582)/2 = 8.512\n      Hour 15 (15:00:00): [5.065, 9.638, 8.160, 8.301] -> sorted: [5.065, 8.160, 8.301, 9.638] -> median = (8.160+8.301)/2 = 8.2305\n      Hour 16 (16:00:00): [5.487, 9.638, 7.597, 7.738] -> sorted: [5.487, 7.597, 7.738, 9.638] -> median = (7.597+7.738)/2 = 7.6675\n      Hour 17 (17:00:00): [4.995, 10.060, 7.246, 7.668] -> sorted: [4.995, 7.246, 7.668, 10.060] -> median = (7.246+7.668)/2 = 7.457\n      Hour 18 (18:00:00): [5.839, 10.060, 7.246, 6.894] -> sorted: [5.839, 6.894, 7.246, 10.060] -> median = (6.894+7.246)/2 = 7.070\n      Hour 19 (19:00:00): [6.191, 9.286, 6.894, 7.597] -> sorted: [6.191, 6.894, 7.597, 9.286] -> median = (6.894+7.597)/2 = 7.2455\n      Hour 20 (20:00:00): [6.261, 9.286, 6.894, 7.105] -> sorted: [6.261, 6.894, 7.105, 9.286] -> median = (6.894+7.105)/2 = 6.9995\n      Hour 21 (21:00:00): [7.105, 9.075, 7.246, 6.542] -> sorted: [6.542, 7.105, 7.246, 9.075] -> median = (7.105+7.246)/2 = 7.1755\n      Hour 22 (22:00:00): [7.035, 8.512, 7.316, 6.120] -> sorted: [6.120, 7.035, 7.316, 8.512] -> median = (7.035+7.316)/2 = 7.1755\n      Hour 23 (23:00:00): [7.879, 8.231, 7.105, 6.331] -> sorted: [6.331, 7.105, 7.879, 8.231] -> median = (7.105+7.879)/2 = 7.492\n\n 27.
