        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) metric.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can use the given data as is.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours), we can consider a model that captures seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 hours.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has negative values and does not look very stationary. We might need to consider differencing.\n\n 5. We'll use an automated approach to select the best parameters for SARIMA, but note that with only 96 points, we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like a seasonal naive forecast, but the problem requires a more sophisticated approach.\n\n 7. We are to provide the complete forecast for the next 96 hours.\n\n 8. Since we are in a simulated environment and cannot run actual code, we will simulate the forecasting process.\n\n However, note: The problem says that the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we proceed.\n\n Given the constraints, I will describe the steps we would take in a real scenario and then generate a simulated forecast.\n\n Real Approach:\n   - We would decompose the time series to see trend, seasonality, and residuals.\n   - We would check stationarity and apply differencing if needed (both regular and seasonal).\n   - We would use an auto_arima function (like pmdarima) to select the best SARIMA parameters (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m with m=24.\n   - Then we would generate the forecast for 96 steps.\n\n But since we cannot run code, we have to rely on the patterns in the data.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - The data has a clear daily pattern: \n        * During the day (from 9:00 to 16:00) the values are generally higher (positive) and at night they are lower (even negative).\n        * There are two days (July 5 and 6) that show negative values in the evening and night, and July 4 and 7 also show similar patterns.\n\n   - The magnitude of the peaks and troughs varies.\n\n   - We can try to capture the seasonality by taking the average of each hour over the 4 days and then adjust for any trend.\n\n   - However, note that the data is only 4 days, so we don't have a long-term trend. We might assume that the next 4 days will follow a similar pattern.\n\n   - We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be too simplistic and ignore the possibility of a trend.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use the last day (July 7) as the base and adjust by the average hourly pattern? \n\n   - Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will generate a forecast by:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the hourly average for the 24 hours over the 4 days.\n        Step 2: But note that the data has a downward trend? Let's check:\n\n            July 4: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n            July 5: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n            July 6: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n            July 7: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n\n        We can compute:\n\n            July 4: \n                1.875+3.014+2.478+2.679+2.076+2.679+1.072+1.541+1.875+3.684+5.425+5.224+4.086+3.684+5.492+3.751+1.875+1.407+0.000-0.067+0.000+0.000+0.335+1.340\n                = 1.875+3.014+2.478+2.679+2.076+2.679+1.072+1.541+1.875+3.684+5.425+5.224+4.086+3.684+5.492+3.751+1.875+1.407+0-0.067+0+0+0.335+1.340\n                = 60.256\n\n            July 5: \n                2.277+2.478+1.741+2.679+1.608+1.541+1.674+1.541+1.005+2.411+4.555+4.756+4.622+5.626+2.411+1.273+1.072-1.875-2.679-2.210-1.741-1.608-0.938-0.536\n                = 2.277+2.478+1.741+2.679+1.608+1.541+1.674+1.541+1.005+2.411+4.555+4.756+4.622+5.626+2.411+1.273+1.072-1.875-2.679-2.210-1.741-1.608-0.938-0.536\n                = 30.192\n\n            July 6:\n                0.134-0.201-0.469-0.134-0.268-0.938-0.871-0.737-0.201-0.938-0.335-0.134+2.210-0.402+2.009-0.402-0.603-1.206-2.143-2.076-1.407-1.474-1.407-1.005\n                = 0.134-0.201-0.469-0.134-0.268-0.938-0.871-0.737-0.201-0.938-0.335-0.134+2.210-0.402+2.009-0.402-0.603-1.206-2.143-2.076-1.407-1.474-1.407-1.005\n                = -10.135\n\n            July 7:\n                0.603-0.268+0.335-0.335-0.268-1.072-0.871-0.402+0.000+0.067+0.000+0.067-0.737-0.268-0.469-0.603-0.469-1.206-2.143-2.679-1.206-1.608-0.603-0.201\n                = 0.603-0.268+0.335-0.335-0.268-1.072-0.871-0.402+0+0.067+0+0.067-0.737-0.268-0.469-0.603-0.469-1.206-2.143-2.679-1.206-1.608-0.603-0.201\n                = -12.189\n\n        The daily averages are decreasing: 60.256/24\u22482.51, 30.192/24\u22481.26, -10.135/24\u2248-0.42, -12.189/24\u2248-0.51.\n\n        There is a clear downward trend. We might fit a linear trend to these 4 points and project for the next 4 days? But that would be too coarse.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without running actual code, we decide to use a simple method:\n\n        We will compute the hourly averages for the 4 days, but then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average for each hour (across the 4 days) to get a base pattern.\n\n        Step 2: Compute the daily average for each day and then the overall trend in daily averages.\n\n        Step 3: For the next 4 days, we assume the daily average will continue to decrease at the same rate? But the last two days are negative and the trend might be leveling off? \n\n        The daily averages: \n            Day1: 2.51\n            Day2: 1.26\n            Day3: -0.42\n            Day4: -0.51\n\n        The differences: \n            Day2 - Day1 = -1.25\n            Day3 - Day2 = -1.68\n            Day4 - Day3 = -0.09\n\n        The average daily change: (-1.25 -1.68 -0.09)/3 = -3.02/3 = -1.0067 per day.\n\n        Then we might project:\n            Day5: Day4 -1.0067 = -0.51 -1.0067 = -1.5167\n            Day6: Day5 -1.0067 = -2.5234\n            Day7: Day6 -1.0067 = -3.5301\n            Day8: Day7 -1.0067 = -4.5368\n\n        But this leads to increasingly negative values and we only need 4 days (96 hours) which is exactly 4 days.\n\n        However, note that the data might be stabilizing? The last two days are similar. Alternatively, we could use the average of the last two days as the base for the next days? \n\n        Given the volatility, a conservative approach is to assume the next 4 days will have the same daily average as the last two days? i.e., around (-0.42 -0.51)/2 = -0.465.\n\n        But then we have 4 days at that average? \n\n        We'll do:\n\n            Forecast for day5 to day8: each day has an average of -0.465.\n\n        Then, for each hour in the day, we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and then adjust so that the daily average becomes -0.465.\n\n        How? Let the base hourly pattern (from the 4 days) for hour i be H_i. The average of H_i over 24 hours is the overall average of the 4 days: (2.51+1.26-0.42-0.51)/4 = (2.51+1.26=3.77; 3.77-0.42=2.84; 2.84-0.51=2.33) -> 2.33/4 = 0.5825.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we want the daily average to be -0.465. So we shift the base pattern by: shift = -0.465 - 0.5825 = -1.0475.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour i in any of the next 4 days is: H_i - 1.0475.\n\n        But note: the base pattern H_i is the average of 4 days. We are not capturing the intra-day variation? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the shift? But the last day is very negative.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we choose a simpler method: use the average of the last two days for each hour as the forecast for the next four days? But that would be 48 hours, and we need 96. We can repeat the last two days twice? \n\n        The next 4 days: \n            Day5: same as Day3? \n            Day6: same as Day4?\n            Day7: same as Day3?\n            Day8: same as Day4?\n\n        But that would be:\n\n            Day5: 2017-07-06 pattern\n            Day6: 2017-07-07 pattern\n            Day7: 2017-07-06 pattern\n            Day8: 2017-07-07 pattern\n\n        However, the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are forecasting and we don't have missing values in the base data.\n\n        But note: the data provided for the last two days (Day3 and Day4) are:\n\n            Day3: 2017-07-06\n            Day4: 2017-07-07\n\n        We are to forecast:\n\n            Day5: 2017-07-08\n            Day6: 2017-07-09\n            Day7: 2017-07-10\n            Day8: 2017-07-11\n\n        We can use:\n\n            July 08: same as July 06\n            July 09: same as July 07\n            July 10: same as July 06\n            July 11: same as July 07\n\n        But note: the data for July 06 and 07 are:\n\n            July 06: [0.134, -0.201, -0.469, -0.134, -0.268, -0.938, -0.871, -0.737, -0.201, -0.938, -0.335, -0.134, 2.210, -0.402, 2.009, -0.402, -0.603, -1.206, -2.143, -2.076, -1.407, -1.474, -1.407, -1.005]\n            July 07: [0.603, -0.268, 0.335, -0.335, -0.268, -1.072, -0.871, -0.402, 0.000, 0.067, 0.000, 0.067, -0.737, -0.268, -0.469, -0.603, -0.469, -1.206, -2.143, -2.679, -1.206, -1.608, -0.603, -0.201]\n\n        Then the forecast:\n\n            2017-07-08 00:00:00: 0.134\n            2017-07-08 01:00:00: -0.201\n            ... until 23:00: -1.005\n\n            2017-07-09 00:00:00: 0.603\n            2017-07-09 01:00:00: -0.268\n            ... until 23:00: -0.201\n\n            2017-07-10 00:00:00: 0.134\n            ... same as July 08\n\n            2017-07-11 00:00:00: 0.603\n            ... same as July 09\n\n        This is a seasonal naive forecast with seasonality of 48 hours? But the data has a 24-hour seasonality. Why 48? Because we are taking two days as a cycle? \n\n        However, the problem has a daily seasonality (24 hours). So a more standard approach is to use the last day (24 hours) as the forecast for the next days? But we have two different patterns in the last two days.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days for each hour? \n\n        For hour 0: (0.134 + 0.603)/2 = 0.3685\n        For hour 1: (-0.201 -0.268)/2 = -0.2345\n        ... and so on.\n\n        Then we use that averaged day for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        This would be:\n\n            Day5 to Day8: each day is the same: the average of July 06 and July 07.\n\n        But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are not missing in the base. We are using the last two days to form an average day.\n\n        This method is simple and captures the recent pattern.\n\n 11. We choose the average of the last two days for each hour and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days? But wait, we have 4 days to forecast, and we are creating one averaged day. Then we repeat that averaged day 4 times.\n\n        So:\n\n            Let H_i = (value at hour i on July 06 + value at hour i on July 07) / 2, for i in 0..23.\n\n        Then the forecast for any day j in {5,6,7,8} and hour i is H_i.\n\n        But note: the dates:\n\n            We are to forecast 96 hours starting from 2017-07-08 00:00:00.\n\n            Day5: 2017-07-08 (00:00 to 23:00) -> 24 hours\n            Day6: 2017-07-09\n            Day7: 2017-07-10\n            Day8: 2017-07-11\n\n        So we will have 4 identical days? \n\n        However, we might want to account for a trend? The last two days are the most recent and we are averaging them. This assumes the next days will be like the average of the last two days.\n\n 12.

Actually July 07 hour18 is -2.143? \n        Let me check: \n            July 06: 18:00: -2.143\n            July 07: 18:00: -2.143? \n        But in the data for July 07: \n            2017-07-07 18:00:00 -2.143 -> yes, same as July 06.\n\n        hour18: (-2.143 -2.143)/2 = -2.143\n\n        hour19: (-2.076 + (-2.679)) / 2 = -2.3775\n        hour20: (-1.407 + (-1.206)) / 2 = -1.3065\n        hour21: (-1.474 + (-1.608)) / 2 = -1.541\n        hour22: (-1.407 + (-0.603)) / 2 = -1.005\n        hour23: (-1.005 + (-0.201)) / 2 = -0.603\n\n        Then the forecast for each day from 2017-07-08 to 2017-07-11 will be:\n\n            Day1 (2017-07-08): \n                00:00:00: 0.3685\n                01:00:00: -0.2345\n                02:00:00: -0.067\n                03:00:00: -0.2345\n                04:00:00: -0.268\n                05:00:00: -1.005\n                06:00:00: -0.871\n                07:00:00: -0.5695\n                08:00:00: -0.1005\n                09:00:00: -0.4355\n                10:00:00: -0.1675\n                11:00:00: -0.0335\n                12:00:00: 0.7365\n                13:00:00: -0.335\n                14:00:00: 0.77\n                15:00:00: -0.5025\n                16:00:00: -0.536\n                17:00:00: -1.206\n                18:00:00: -2.143\n                19:00:00: -2.3775\n                20:00:00: -1.3065\n                21:00:00: -1.541\n                22:00:00: -1.005\n                23:00:00: -0.603\n\n            And then repeat the same for the next three days.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but we are not missing in the base. We are providing a complete forecast.\n\n 14. We must format the answer exactly as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date] [value]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 15. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-08 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-08 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n 16. We'll write the forecasted values as the averaged day repeated 4 times.\n\n 17. However, note that the real data might have a trend, but we are not accounting for it. This is a simple and reasonable approach given the constraints.\n\n 18. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL', with the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.\n\n 19. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
