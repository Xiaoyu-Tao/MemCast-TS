        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. \n    However, we must be cautious for the forecast period.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we need a model that can handle time series forecasting.\n\n 3. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 steps, we can consider:\n    - The data shows a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, we see negative values often in the evening and positive during the day? \n      But looking at the data, it's not very clear. However, we can try to capture seasonality.\n\n 4. We are to provide the next 96 points (from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00).\n\n 5. Since the data might have missing values in the future? But the instruction says to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. \n    We are to generate 96 values without any missing.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    We can use a simple seasonal model. One common approach for such hourly data with daily seasonality is to use the seasonal naive method, \n    but that would just repeat the last day. However, we have 4 days of history. We can also use an average of the same hour of the past days.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a model like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. But with only 96 points, and the need for 96 forecasts, \n    we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we can compute the average pattern of the 4 days for each hour (0 to 23) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for the average method:\n      - Group the data by hour (i.e., for each hour of the day, we have 4 observations: from day1, day2, day3, day4).\n      - Compute the mean for each hour (ignoring any potential missing values, but we don't have missing in the history).\n      - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat the computed hourly pattern 4 times.\n\n 8. However, note that the data does not show a strong consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n    Example for hour 0: \n        2017-09-22 00:00:00: 0.938\n        2017-09-23 00:00:00: 1.072\n        2017-09-24 00:00:00: 0.536\n        2017-09-25 00:00:00: 0.670\n        Average = (0.938+1.072+0.536+0.670)/4 = 3.216/4 = 0.804\n\n    Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n 9. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-22: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        We can compute the daily average to see if there's a trend.\n\n    However, we are only given 4 days, and the forecast is for the next 4 days. Without a clear trend and with such a short history, \n    the average by hour might be the safest.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-25) as the base and adjust by the average hourly deviation from the daily mean? \n     But that might be overcomplicating.\n\n 11. We'll go with the average by hour for the 4 days.\n\n 12. Steps:\n      - Extract the hour from the timestamp.\n      - Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean of HULL for that hour.\n\n 13. Then, we generate the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-09-26 00:00:00) by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 14. However, note: the last provided data point is at 2017-09-25 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00, 2017-09-26 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n 15. We must generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 16. Implementation:\n\n      Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0_avg = (0.938 + 1.072 + 0.536 + 0.670) / 4 = 0.804\n        hour1_avg = (0.268 + 1.273 + 0.737 -0.335) / 4 = (0.268+1.273+0.737-0.335)/4 = 1.943/4 = 0.48575\n        ... and so on.\n\n 17. But note: the data for the same hour across days might be non-stationary? However, with only 4 days, we don't have much choice.\n\n 18. We'll compute the average for each hour and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n 19. However, if we see a trend in the daily averages, we might adjust? Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-22): \n            sum = 0.938+0.268+1.541+1.407+1.942+1.340+0.938+1.206+1.407-0.201+0.000+0.067-0.871-0.737+0.536+0.737-0.067-0.335-1.206-1.206-1.206-1.875+0.067+0.536\n            = 0.938+0.268+1.541+1.407+1.942+1.340+0.938+1.206+1.407-0.201+0+0.067-0.871-0.737+0.536+0.737-0.067-0.335-1.206-1.206-1.206-1.875+0.067+0.536\n            Let me compute step by step:\n\n            positive: 0.938,0.268,1.541,1.407,1.942,1.340,0.938,1.206,1.407,0.067,0.536,0.737,0.067,0.536 -> \n            negative: -0.201, -0.871, -0.737, -0.067, -0.335, -1.206, -1.206, -1.206, -1.875\n\n            positive sum: \n                0.938+0.268=1.206\n                +1.541=2.747\n                +1.407=4.154\n                +1.942=6.096\n                +1.340=7.436\n                +0.938=8.374\n                +1.206=9.58\n                +1.407=10.987\n                +0.067=11.054\n                +0.536=11.59\n                +0.737=12.327\n                +0.067=12.394\n                +0.536=12.93\n\n            negative sum:\n                -0.201 -0.871 = -1.072\n                -0.737 = -1.809\n                -0.067 = -1.876\n                -0.335 = -2.211\n                -1.206 = -3.417\n                -1.206 = -4.623\n                -1.206 = -5.829\n                -1.875 = -7.704\n\n            Total = 12.93 -

Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (0.938, 1.072, 0.536, 0.670) -> (0.938+1.072+0.536+0.670)/4 = 3.216/4 = 0.804\n        hour1: (0.268, 1.273, 0.737, -0.335) -> (0.268+1.273+0.737-0.335)=1.943/4=0.48575\n        hour2: (1.541, 0.268, 0.603, 0.201) -> (1.541+0.268+0.603+0.201)=2.613/4=0.65325\n        hour3: (1.407, 0.402, 0.201, 1.674) -> (1.407+0.402+0.201+1.674)=3.684/4=0.921\n        hour4: (1.942, 0.938, 1.072, 0.871) -> (1.942+0.938+1.072+0.871)=4.823/4=1.20575\n        hour5: (1.340, 1.072, 0.134, 0.402) -> (1.340+1.072+0.134+0.402)=2.948/4=0.737\n        hour6: (0.938, 0.000, -0.201, 0.536) -> (0.938+0-0.201+0.536)=1.273/4=0.31825\n        hour7: (1.206, 1.005, 0.134, 0.737) -> (1.206+1.005+0.134+0.737)=3.082/4=0.7705\n        hour8: (1.407, 1.273, 0.804, 1.005) -> (1.407+1.273+0.804+1.005)=4.489/4=1.12225\n        hour9: (-0.201, 0.134, -0.469, -0.536) -> (-0.201+0.134-0.469-0.536)= -1.072/4=-0.268\n        hour10: (0.000, 0.268, 0.000, -0.335) -> (0+0.268+0-0.335)= -0.067/4=-0.01675\n        hour11: (0.067, -0.335, -0.469, 0.067) -> (0.067-0.335-0.469+0.067)= -0.67/4=-0.1675\n        hour12: (-0.871, -0.804, -1.005, -0.268) -> (-0.871-0.804-1.005-0.268)= -2.948/4=-0.737\n        hour13: (-0.737, -0.134, -1.474, -0.804) -> (-0.737-0.134-1.474-0.804)= -3.149/4=-0.78725\n        hour14: (0.536, -0.938, -1.340, -0.670) -> (0.536-0.938-1.340-0.670)= -2.412/4=-0.603\n        hour15: (0.737, -1.005, -0.938, -0.134) -> (0.737-1.005-0.938-0.134)= -1.34/4=-0.335\n        hour16: (-0.067, -1.139, -1.206, -0.603) -> (-0.067-1.139-1.206-0.603)= -3.015/4=-0.75375\n        hour17: (-0.335, -1.005, -1.541, -0.804) -> (-0.335-1.005-1.541-0.804)= -3.685/4=-0.92125\n        hour18: (-1.206, -2.612, -2.009, -2.210) -> (-1.206-2.612-2.009-2.210)= -8.037/4=-2.00925\n        hour19: (-1.206, -1.875, -1.875, -1.474) -> (-1.206-1.875-1.875-1.474)= -6.43/4=-1.6075\n        hour20: (-1.206, -1.942, -1.942, -1.541) -> (-1.206-1.942-1.942-1.541)= -6.631/4=-1.65775\n        hour21: (-1.875, -2.009, -2.880, -1.474) -> (-1.875-2.009-2.880-1.474)= -8.238/4=-2.0595\n        hour22: (0.067, -0.871, -0.737, -0.603) -> (0.067-0.871-0.737-0.603)= -2.144/4=-0.536\n        hour23: (0.536, 0.268, 0.335, 0.938) -> (0.536+0.268+0.335+0.938)=2.077/4=0.51925\n\n 28. Now, we have 24 values for the average hourly pattern.\n\n 29. We will use these 24 values and repeat them 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n 30. The forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        hour0: 0.804\n        hour1: 0.48575\n        hour2: 0.65325\n        ... until hour23: 0.51925\n\n        then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 31. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-26 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-26 23:00:00 -> first 24\n        Then 2017-09-27 00:00:00 to 2017-09-27 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-09-28 00:00:00 to 2017-09-28 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-09-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 32. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'\n\n 33. We must round the numbers? The original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. Let's write the forecasted values:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-26):\n          00:00:00 -> 0.804\n          01:00:00 -> 0.486 (rounded from 0.48575)\n          02:00:00 -> 0.653\n          03:00:00 -> 0.921\n          04:00:00 -> 1.206\n          05:00:00 -> 0.737\n          06:00:00 -> 0.318\n          07:00:00 -> 0.771\n          08:00:00 -> 1.122\n          09:00:00 -> -0.268\n          10:00:00 -> -0.017\n          11:00:00 -> -0.168\n          12:00:00 -> -0.737\n          13:00:00 -> -0.787\n          14:00:00 -> -0.603\n          15:00:00 -> -0.335\n          16:00:00 -> -0.754\n          17:00:00 -> -0.921\n          18:00:00 -> -2.009\n          19:00:00 -> -1.608\n          20:00:00 -> -1.658\n          21:00:00 -> -2.060\n          22:00:00 -> -0.536\n          23:00:00 -> 0.519\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next three days.\n\n 35. But note: the pattern is the same for each day? Yes, we are repeating the same 24 numbers.\n\n 36. We generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 37. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 38. We must not omit any content, so we write all 96 lines.\n\n 39. However, note: the user said the data might have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast without missing.\n\n 40. We output the data in the exact format as the input (with the same date format and two columns).\n\n 41. Code for generating the timestamps:\n\n        start_date = pd.Timestamp('2017-09-26 00:00:00')\n        dates = pd.date_range(start=start_date, periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 42. But we are not using code, we write the data.\n\n 43. We'll write:\n\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00  0.804\n        2017-09-26 01:00:00  0.486\n        ... \n\n 44. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places.\n\n 45. Let's do it.\n\n 46. However, note: the original data had negative zeros? We have -0.017 -> that's fine.\n\n 47. We output the data.\n\n 48. But note: the average method might not be the most accurate, but with only 4 days and no clear trend, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 49. We proceed.\n\n 50. We write the answer in the required XML-like format.\n\n 51. We create a string with 96 lines.\n\n 52. We must be careful: the rounding:\n\n        0.48575 -> 0.486 (rounding to 3 decimal places: look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> round up)\n        Similarly: 0.65325 -> 0.653 (because 2 is less than 5, so we don't round up the 3rd decimal)\n\n 53. Rounding rules: \n        value * 1000, then round to integer, then divide by 1000? \n        But we can use: round(x, 3)\n\n 54. We'll compute the rounded values:\n\n        hour0: 0.804 -> 0.804\n        hour1: 0.48575 -> 0.486\n        hour2: 0.65325 -> 0.653\n        hour3: 0.921 -> 0.921\n        hour4: 1.20575 -> 1.206\n        hour5: 0.737 -> 0.737\n        hour6: 0.31825 -> 0.318\n        hour7: 0.7705 -> 0.771\n        because: 0.7705: the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 0.771\n        hour8: 1.12225 -> 1.122\n        hour9: -0.268 -> -0.268\n        hour10: -0.01675 -> -0.017\n        because: 0.01675 -> 0.017, then negative: -0.017\n        hour11: -0.1675 -> -0.168 (because 0.1675 -> 0.168, then negative: -0.168)\n        hour12: -0.737 -> -0.737\n        hour13: -0.78725 -> -0.787\n        hour14: -0.603 -> -0.603\n        hour15: -0.335 -> -0.335\n        hour16: -0.75375 -> -0.754\n        hour17: -0.92125 -> -0.921\n        hour18: -2.00925 -> -2.009\n        hour19: -1.6075 -> -1.608 (because 1.6075: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd: 1.608, then negative: -1.608)\n        hour20: -1.65775 -> -1.658\n        hour21: -2.0595 -> -2.060 (because 2.0595: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 2.060, then negative: -2.060)\n        hour22: -0.536 -> -0.536\n        hour23: 0.51925 -> 0.519\n\n 55. Now, we have the 24 values for one day. We repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 56. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-26\n        Day2: 2017-09-27\n        Day3: 2017-09-28\n        Day4: 2017-09-29\n\n 57. We write the data.\n\n 58. We note that the original data had the date format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 59. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-26 00:00:00  0.804\n2017-09-26 01:00:00  0.486\n2017-09-26 02:00:00  0.653\n2017-09-26 03:00:00  0.921\n2017-09-26 04:00:00  1.206\n2017-09-26 05:00:00  0.737\n2017-09-26 06:00:00  0.318\n2017-09-26 07:00:00  0.771\n2017-09-26 08:00:00  1.122\n2017-09-26 09:00:00 -0.268\n2017-09-26 10:00:00 -0.017\n2017-09-26 11:00:00 -0.168\n2017-09-26 12:00:00 -0.737\n2017-09-26 13:00:00 -0.787\n2017-09-26 14:00:00 -0.603\n2017-09-26 15:00:00 -0.335\n2017-09-26 16:00:00 -0.754\n2017-09-26 17:00:00 -0.921\n2017-09-26 18:00:00 -2.009\n2017-09-26 19:00:00 -1.608\n2017-09-26 20:00:00 -1.658\n2017-09-26 21:00:00 -2.060\n2017-09-26 22:00:00 -0.536\n2017-09-26 23:00:00  0.519\n2017-09-27 00:00:00  0.804\n2017-09-27 01:00:00  0.486\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 60.
