        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-07-04 00:00:00 to 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for the purpose of forecasting, we must handle any missing values. Since the given 96 points are complete, we can proceed to model.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might not be captured).\n\n 4. We can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality. Given the data is hourly, we might consider:\n    - SARIMA (with seasonal period 24)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality)\n    - Prophet (which can handle multiple seasonality and missing data, but we don't have missing data in-sample)\n\n 5. However, note that the data is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history. We must be cautious.\n\n 6. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate the timestamps and the forecasted OT.\n\n 7. Since the problem states that the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none, we can proceed without imputation for the history.\n\n 8. We choose a model: Given the small data, we might use a simple model. Let's try to decompose the series to see if there is a pattern.\n\n    Observing the data:\n      - There is a clear daily pattern: temperatures are lower at night and higher during the day? \n        But looking at the data, we see that on 2017-07-04, the temperature rises during the day (from 10:00 to 15:00) and then falls.\n        Similarly, on 2017-07-05, we see a rise from 09:00 to 15:00? But note the data on 2017-07-05: \n          09:00: 23.426001 -> then 10:00: 22.441, 11:00: 22.441, 12:00: 20.612, 13:00: 22.441, 14:00:22.089, 15:00:21.315 -> so not a clear peak at noon.\n\n    Actually, the pattern is not very clear. We might need to use a model that can capture the autocorrelation without a strong seasonal assumption.\n\n 9. Given the short history, we might use an AR model with lags. But 96 points is too short for a complex AR model.\n\n10. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) with a seasonal period of 24. However, with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be well estimated.\n\n11. We can also consider a naive method: using the last day (24 hours) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But the problem says to forecast 96 hours (4 days) and we have 4 days of history.\n\n    However, the data does not look exactly repeating. For example, the level on 2017-07-04 is around 19-23, then 2017-07-05 has a peak of 24.8, and then 2017-07-06 and 07 are around 19-23 again.\n\n12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we will use a simple model: \n    (Seasonal Autoregressive model) with a seasonality of 24. We can also try to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But that would be 4 points per hour? We have only 4 days.\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a flat forecast for each hour across the days.\n\n    However, we see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. The level changes.\n\n13. Another idea: use the last day (24 hours) and then adjust by the average change from day to day? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n14. Given the constraints, we will use a model that can capture a trend and seasonality. We'll use Holt-Winters with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n    We can use the `ExponentialSmoothing` from statsmodels. But note: we have only 4 days (96 points) and we are forecasting 4 days (96 points) which is the same length as the history.\n\n    This might be unstable.\n\n15. Alternatively, we can use a simple linear regression with dummy variables for the hour of the day and a time trend. But with 4 days, we can have:\n\n        OT = beta0 + beta1 * t + beta2 * hour1 + ... + beta24 * hour23   [if we use 24 dummy variables]\n\n    However, we have 96 points and 25 parameters (24 dummies + intercept + time trend) -> that's 26 parameters? That might overfit.\n\n16. We can try a time trend and then use the average of the residuals per hour? \n\n    Steps for that:\n      a. Fit a linear trend: regress OT on time index (t=0 to 95).\n      b. Compute the residuals.\n      c. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average residual for that hour over the 4 days.\n      d. Then for forecasting, for time t from 96 to 191, we:\n          - compute the linear trend prediction: intercept + slope * t\n          - add the average residual for the corresponding hour (i.e., hour = (t mod 24))\n\n    But note: the residuals might not be stationary? \n\n17. Given the time, we choose a simple method: the average of the last 4 days for each hour. \n\n    We group by hour (i.e., the hour of the day: 0,1,...,23) and take the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n    Then we repeat that pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n    How to do:\n        Step 1: Extract the hour from the datetime index.\n        Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n        Step 3: For the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00), assign the mean value for that hour.\n\n    Example: \n        For hour 0: we have 4 values: \n            2017-07-04 00:00:00 -> 19.697001\n            2017-07-05 00:00:00 -> 20.681999\n            2017-07-06 00:00:00 -> 21.385000\n            2017-07-07 00:00:00 -> 20.893000\n        Average = (19.697001+20.681999+21.385000+20.893000)/4 = 20.664\n\n    Then for 2017-07-08 00:00:00, 2017-07-09 00:00:00, 2017-07-10 00:00:00, 2017-07-11 00:00:00: we use 20.664.\n\n    Similarly for other hours.\n\n    This method is simple and captures the daily pattern.\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = (19.697+19.838+...+21.104)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n        Day1: from 19.697 to 23.143 then down to 21.104 -> average around 20.5?\n        Day2: 20.682 to 24.832 then down to 22.441 -> average around 22?\n        Day3: 21.385 to 22.792 then down to 21.808 -> average around 22?\n        Day4: 20.893 to 22.58 then down to 21.174 -> average around 21.5?\n\n        The average per day: \n          Day1: 20.697 (approx)\n          Day2: 21.8 (approx)\n          Day3: 21.8 (approx)\n          Day4: 21.3 (approx)\n\n        There is no clear upward or downward trend. So using the average per hour might be acceptable.\n\n    However, note that the last day (2017-07-07) has a lower average? But we are going to use the average of the four days for each hour.\n\n    This method will smooth out the daily pattern and ignore any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n18. We'll go with the average per hour.\n\n    Steps:\n        - Create a list of the 96 historical data points.\n        - Extract the hour of the time (the date string has the time, but we can parse the hour from the index).\n        - Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n        - For the next 96 hours, we will have 4 full days. For each hour in the day, we have 4 occurrences (one for each day in the forecast horizon).\n\n    How to generate the dates?\n        The last date in the history is 2017-07-07 23:00:00.\n        The next date is 2017-07-08 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n    We can generate the dates with pandas: \n        start = '2017-07-08 00:00:00'\n        end = '2017-07-11 23:00:00'\n        freq = 'H'\n\n    Then for each date in this new index, we get the hour and then assign the average OT for that hour.\n\n19. Implementation:\n\n    We are to output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00 <value>\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00 <value>\n        ...\n        2017-07-11 23:00:00 <value>\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n    We must not omit any.\n\n20. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We have 4 days, so for hour 0: \n        values: [19.697001, 20.681999, 21.385000, 20.893000] -> mean = (19.697001+20.681999+21.385000+20.893000)/4 = 82.656/4 = 20.664\n\n    hour 1: [19.837999, 20.612000, 21.597000, 21.878000] -> (19.838+20.612+21.597+21.878)/4 = 83.925/4 = 20.98125\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n    We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n21. We note: the data provided has 96 points, so we can split into 4 groups of 24.\n\n    We can reshape the OT data into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along axis=0.\n\n22. Code in mind (but we are not coding, we are to write the output):\n\n    We'll compute the 24 means:\n\n        hour0: 20.664\n        hour1: 20.98125\n        hour2: (19.979+20.541+21.808+21.456) = 84.784 -> 21.196\n        hour3: (19.486+20.682+21.878+21.315) = 83.361 -> 20.84025\n        hour4: (19.416+21.034+21.878+21.808) = 84.136 -> 21.034\n        hour5: (19.556+20.893+21.667+21.174) = 83.29 -> 20.8225\n        hour6: (19.627+21.034+21.878+22.3) = 84.839 -> 21.20975\n        hour7: (19.697+21.456+21.948+22.58) = 85.681 -> 21.42025\n        hour8: (19.838+21.104+22.722+21.878) = 85.542 -> 21.3855\n        hour9: (19.486+23.426+21.526+20.471) = 84.909 -> 21.22725\n        hour10: (18.783+22.441+20.823+19.344999) = 81.392 -> 20.348\n        hour11: (18.923+22.441+21.385+19.064) = 81.813 -> 20.45325\n        hour12: (19.486+20.612+21.245+19.275) = 80.618 -> 20.1545\n        hour13: (20.26+22.441+21.526+19.908) = 84.135 -> 21.03375\n        hour14: (22.652+22.089+22.018+20.541) = 87.3 -> 21.825\n        hour15: (23.144+21.315+22.792+20.893) = 88.144 -> 22.036\n        hour16: (22.37+22.581+21.526+22.23) = 88.707 -> 22.17675\n        hour17: (20.963+22.863+23.426+22.37) = 89.622 -> 22.4055\n        hour18: (20.682+24.832+22.23+22.019) = 89.763 -> 22.44075\n        hour19: (21.808+22.23+22.019+21.948) = 88.005 -> 22.00125\n        hour20: (20.823+22.441+22.722+21.526) = 87.512 -> 21.878\n        hour21: (21.385+21.808+22.511+21.597) = 87.301 -> 21.82525\n        hour22: (21.034+22.3+21.878+21.315) = 86.527 -> 21.63175\n        hour23: (21.104+22.441+21.808+21.174) = 86.527 -> 21.63175   [Note: 21.104+22.441+21.808+21.174 = 86.527]\n\n    But wait, let me recalc hour23: \n        21.104 + 22.441 = 43.545\n        +21.808 = 65.353\n        +21.174 = 86.527 -> 86.527/4 = 21.63175\n\n    However, note that the last value of the history (2017-07-07 23:00:00) is 21.174, which is included.\n\n23. Now, for the forecast:\n\n    The next 96 hours: \n        Day1: 2017-07-08 (Saturday) to 2017-07-08 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-07-09\n        Day3: 2017-07-10\n        Day4: 2017-07-11\n\n    We will assign:\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00 -> hour0: 20.664\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00 -> hour1: 20.98125\n        ... \n        2017-07-08 23:00:00 -> hour23: 21.63175\n\n        Then 2017-07-09 00:00:00 -> hour0: 20.664\n        ... and so on.\n\n24. We must output 96 lines.\n\n25. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-07-08 00:00:00 20.664\n        2017-07-08 01:00:00 20.98125\n        2017-07-08 02:00:00 21.196\n        2017-07-08 03:00:00 20.84025\n        2017-07-08 04:00:00 21.034\n        2017-07-08 05:00:00 20.8225\n        2017-07-08 06:00:00 21.20975\n        2017-07-08 07:00:00 21.42025\n        2017-07-08 08:00:00 21.3855\n        2017-07-08 09:00:00 21.22725\n        2017-07-08 10:00:00 20.348\n        2017-07-08 11:00:00 20.45325\n        2017-07-08 12:00:00 20.1545\n        2017-07-08 13:00:00 21.03375\n        2017-07-08 14:00:00 21.825\n        2017-07-08 15:00:00 22.036\n        2017-07-08 16:00:00 22.17675\n        2017-07-08 17:00:00 22.4055\n        2017-07-08 18:00:00 22.44075\n        2017-07-08 19:00:00 22.00125\n        2017-07-08 20:00:00 21.878\n        2017-07-08 21:00:00 21.82525\n        2017-07-08 22:00:00 21.63175\n        2017-07-08 23:00:00 21.63175\n\n    Then 2017-07-09 00:00:00: 20.664 (same as 2017-07-08 00:00:00)\n\n    and so on.\n\n26. We note: the hour23 average was 21.63175, and we use that for every day at 23:00.\n\n27. We must output the data in the same precision? The input had 3 decimal places, but we computed with more. We'll output with 6 decimal places as in the input.\n\n    But note: the input had up to 6 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 or 6? \n\n        Example: 19.697001 -> 6 decimal places.\n\n    We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n    However, our computed averages are at 5 decimal places? We can round to 6.\n\n    But note: the average might be an exact float? We'll write as float with 6 decimal places.\n\n    Example: 20.664 -> 20.664000\n\n28. But let me recalc hour0: \n        (19.697001+20.681999+21.385000+20.893000)/4 = (19.697001+20.681999=40.379, +21.385000=61.764, +20.893000=82.657) -> 82.657/4=20.664250\n\n    So we should use 20.664250.\n\n    We must recalc with the exact numbers.\n\n    We'll recalc each hour with the exact given numbers.\n\n    We'll do:\n\n        hour0: (19.697001 + 20.681999 + 21.385000 + 20.893000) / 4 = 82.656000 / 4 = 20.664000\n\n    hour1: (19.837999 + 20.612000 + 21.597000 + 21.878000) = 83.924999 -> 83.924999/4 = 20.98124975 -> round to 6 decimals: 20.981250\n\n    But let's do it step by step for one:\n\n        hour0: \n            19.697001\n            20.681999\n            21.385000\n            20.893000\n            Sum = 19.697001 + 20.681999 = 40.379000\n                 40.379000 + 21.385000 = 61.764000\n                 61.764000 + 20.893000 = 82.657000\n            Then 82.657000 / 4 = 20.664250\n\n    So hour0: 20.664250\n\n    We must do this for every hour.\n\n    We'll recalc all 24 hours with the exact numbers.\n\n    We'll list the exact values for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [19.697001, 20.681999, 21.385000, 20.893000] -> sum=82.657000 -> mean=20.664250\n        hour1: [19.837999, 20.612000, 21.597000, 21.878000] -> \n                19.837999+20.612000=40.449999\n                40.449999+21.597000=62.046999\n                62.046999+21.878000=83.924999 -> mean=20.98124975 -> 20.981250 (if rounded to 6 decimals, but we can keep as 20.981250)\n\n    We'll keep the full precision and output with 6 decimal places.\n\n    We can compute in a programmatic way in our code, but since we are writing by hand, we do:\n\n        hour0: 20.664250\n        hour1: 20.981250   (because 83.924999/4 = 20.98124975 -> rounded to 6 decimals: 20.981250? \n                Actually, we can output the exact float representation. We'll use 6 decimal places, so 20.981250)\n\n    However, note: the input had 6 decimal places, so we should output 6.\n\n    We'll compute each hour:\n\n        hour0: 20.657000? Wait, I think I made a mistake: \n            hour0: \n                19.697001\n                20.681999\n                21.385000\n                20.893000\n            Let me add again: \n
