        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00) for Oil Temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any explicit NaN. \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values\", but in the sample provided we don't see any. \n    So we assume that the provided 96 points are complete? But we are to be aware of missing values in general.\n\n 2. Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", we should handle missing values if present. But in the given data, there are none. \n    However, for forecasting, we must produce 96 points without any missing values.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. We can use a time series model. Given the hourly data and the seasonality (daily pattern might be present),\n    we can consider models like SARIMA, or even a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows:\n    - A daily pattern: for example, on 2017-09-02, the temperature starts at 10.693 at 00:00, then decreases until around 04:00-06:00, then increases during the day, and decreases again at night.\n    - There is a trend? The temperature on 2017-09-04 and 2017-09-05 seems higher than the previous days.\n\n 5. We are to provide the next 96 points (4 days) in the same format.\n\n 6. Since we are to provide the complete data, we must output 96 lines of forecasts with the corresponding timestamps.\n\n 7. We'll use an automated approach with a model that can handle seasonality. We choose SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). The seasonality period is 24 (for daily).\n\n 8. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We need to set the seasonal period s=24.\n    - We will use auto_arima from pmdarima to find the best parameters? But we cannot run code, so we have to simulate the process.\n\n 9. However, note: as an AI, I cannot run code. So I will have to use a heuristic or a simple model.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last few days and adjust for the daily pattern.\n\n 11. But the problem says we are an expert, so we must provide a reasonable method.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we can do:\n     - We have 4 days of data (96 hours). We can compute the daily average and then the hourly average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n     - Then we can use these hourly averages as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n 13. However, there is a trend: the temperature on the last two days is higher. We might need to account for that.\n\n 14. Let's break the data by day:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-09-02 (index 0-23): \n        [10.693, 10.482, 10.130, 9.638, 9.778, 9.778, 9.638, 9.638, 10.060, 10.130, 10.763, 10.482, 10.482, 10.904, 11.044, 11.326, 10.833, 10.693, 10.622, 10.552, 10.482, 10.341, 10.271, 10.060]\n     Day 2: 2017-09-03 (index 24-47): \n        [10.130, 9.708, 9.919, 9.708, 8.864, 9.778, 9.778, 9.919, 10.130, 8.442, 10.200, 7.809, 9.989, 7.668, 10.341, 10.411, 10.693, 10.482, 9.919, 9.145, 8.793, 8.371, 6.894, 6.120]\n     Day 3: 2017-09-04 (index 48-71):\n        [8.934, 9.215, 9.638, 10.271, 10.622, 10.693, 11.537, 12.170, 11.607, 12.029, 12.522, 13.647, 14.210, 15.547, 15.687, 14.843, 15.336, 15.687, 15.476, 15.406, 15.265, 14.773, 14.421, 15.054]\n     Day 4: 2017-09-05 (index 72-95):\n        [15.758, 14.280, 12.874, 13.647, 14.703, 15.406, 16.039, 14.562, 14.843, 14.210, 15.758, 15.336, 16.532, 16.954, 16.954, 17.446, 16.391, 15.054, 15.406, 14.562, 13.718, 12.733, 12.944, 13.366]\n\n 15. We see that the temperature on day 3 and 4 is generally higher than day 1 and 2. Also, day 2 has some unusually low values (like 6.12 at 23:00).\n\n 16. We can compute the hourly average for the same hour across the 4 days, but that might be skewed by the trend and the low day2.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last two days (day3 and day4) to compute the hourly pattern and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 18. Since we are forecasting the next 4 days (which is the same length as the history we have we can use a naive method: \n     - Use the last day (day4) as the base and then adjust by the difference between day4 and day3? \n\n 19. But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We can do:\n\n     Let F1 (first forecast day, 2017-09-06) = day4 (2017-09-05) + (day4 - day3) \n        But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 20. Another idea: use the average of day3 and day4 for each hour to form the base pattern, and then add a linear trend component?\n\n 21. We can compute the average of the last two days for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (8.934 + 15.758)/2 = 12.346\n        hour1: (9.215 + 14.280)/2 = 11.7475\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. Then we can compute the overall trend from the entire 4 days? The average of day1, day2, day3, day4:\n\n        day1_avg = mean(day1) = (sum of day1)/24\n        day2_avg = mean(day2) = (10.130+9.708+9.919+9.708+8.864+9.778+9.778+9.919+10.130+8.442+10.200+7.809+9.989+7.668+10.341+10.411+10.693+10.482+9.919+9.145+8.793+8.371+6.894+6.120)/24\n        ... \n\n 23. But we don't need to be too precise. We can see that the temperature is increasing. We can fit a linear regression on the entire 96 points to get a trend, then add the seasonal component.\n\n 24. However, without being able to compute, we can approximate:\n\n     We'll use the average of the last two days (day3 and day4) as the base pattern for the next days. Then, we assume that the next 4 days will follow the same pattern? \n\n 25. But the problem says we must provide the complete data. We are going to generate 96 points.\n\n 26. We can do:\n\n     Let base_pattern = (day3 + day4) / 2   [for each hour of the day]\n\n     Then, for the next 4 days, we use:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-06): base_pattern\n        Day2 (2017-09-07): base_pattern * (1 + growth_rate)   ? but we don't have growth_rate.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we can assume that the pattern is stable for the next 4 days? \n\n 28. Given the short forecast horizon (4 days) and the apparent stability (except for the increasing trend from day1 to day4), we can use the average of the last two days for each hour as the forecast for each of the next four days? \n\n 29. But note: the last two days are day3 and day4, and they are not the same. We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour00: (8.934 + 15.758) / 2 = 12.346\n        hour01: (9.215 + 14.280) / 2 = 11.7475\n        hour02: (9.638 + 12.874) / 2 = 11.256\n        hour03: (10.271 + 13.647) / 2 = 11.959\n        hour04: (10.622 + 14.703) / 2 = 12.6625\n        hour05: (10.693 + 15.406) / 2 = 13.0495\n        hour06: (11.537 + 16.039) / 2 = 13.788\n        hour07: (12.170 + 14.562) / 2 = 13.366\n        hour08: (11.607 + 14.843) / 2 = 13.225\n        hour09: (12.029 + 14.210) / 2 = 13.1195\n        hour10: (12.522 + 15.758) / 2 = 14.140\n        hour11: (13.647 + 15.336) / 2 = 14.4915\n        hour12: (14.210 + 16.532) / 2 = 15.371\n        hour13: (15.547 + 16.954) / 2 = 16.2505\n        hour14: (15.687 + 16.954) / 2 = 16.3205\n        hour15: (14.843 + 17.446) / 2 = 16.1445\n        hour16: (15.336 + 16.391) / 2 = 15.8635\n        hour17: (15.687 + 15.054) / 2 = 15.3705\n        hour18: (15.476 + 15.406) / 2 = 15.441\n        hour19: (15.406 + 14.562) / 2 = 14.984\n        hour20: (15.265 + 13.718) / 2 = 14.4915\n        hour21: (14.773 + 12.733) / 2 = 13.753\n        hour22: (14.421 + 12.944) / 2 = 13.6825\n        hour23: (15.054 + 13.366) / 2 = 14.210\n\n 30. Then we use this pattern for each of the next 4 days? But that would be constant over the 4 days. \n\n 31. However, we see an increasing trend from day3 to day4? \n\n        day3 average: (8.934+9.215+...+15.054)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            We can see day3: starts around 8.9 and goes up to 15.0, average around 13.5? \n        day4: starts at 15.758 and ends at 13.366, average around 15? \n\n        The difference is about 1.5. So if we project, the next day (day5) might be around 15 + 1.5 = 16.5? But that might be too reasonable for 4 days.\n\n 32. Alternatively, we can add a small increment each day? \n\n 33. Since we are not running a model, and to keep it simple, we will use the pattern from the last two days (the average) and then for each subsequent day add a constant increment to the entire day? \n\n        Let the base = average of day4 (which is the last day) \n        base_day4 = (15.758+14.280+...+13.366)/24\n\n        We can compute the average of day4: \n            Let me sum the day4: \n                15.758, 14.280, 12.874, 13.647, 14.703, 15.406, 16.039, 14.562, 14.843, 14.210, 15.758, 15.336, 16.532, 16.954, 16.954, 17.446, 16.391, 15.054, 15.406, 14.562, 13.718, 12.733, 12.944, 13.366\n\n            Sum = 15.758+14.280 = 30.038\n            +12.874 = 42.912\n            +13.647 = 56.559\n            +14.703 = 71.262\n            +15.406 = 86.668\n            +16.039 = 102.707\n            +14.562 = 117.269\n            +14.843 = 132.112\n            +14.210 = 146.322\n            +15.758 = 162.08\n            +15.336 = 177.416\n            +16.532 = 193.948\n            +16.954 = 210.902\n            +16.954 = 227.856\n            +17.446 = 245.302\n            +16.391 = 261.693\n            +15.054 = 276.747\n            +15.406 = 292.153\n            +14.562 = 306.715\n            +13.718 = 320.433\n            +12.733 = 333.166\n            +12.944 = 346.11\n            +13.366 = 359.476\n\n            Average = 359.476 / 24 = 14.9781666667\n\n        Similarly, day3: \n            Sum = 8.934+9.215+9.638+10.271+10.622+10.693+11.537+12.170+11.607+12.029+12.522+13.647+14.210+15.547+15.687+14.843+15.336+15.687+15.476+15.406+15.265+14.773+14.421+15.054\n            = 8.934+9.215=18.149\n            +9.638=27.787\n            +10.271=38.058\n            +10.622=48.68\n            +10.693=59.373\n            +11.537=70.91\n            +12.170=83.08\n            +11.607=94.687\n            +12.029=106.716\n            +12.522=119.238\n            +13.647=132.885\n            +14.210=147.095\n            +15.547=162.642\n            +15.687=178.329\n            +14.843=193.172\n            +15.336=208.508\n            +15.687=224.195\n            +15.476=239.671\n            +15.406=255.077\n            +15.265=270.342\n            +14.773=285.115\n            +14.421=299.536\n            +15.054=314.59\n\n            Average = 314.59 / 24 = 13.1079166667\n\n        The difference per day: 14.978 - 13.108 = 1.87\n\n        So the daily increase is about 1.87? Then for the next day (day5) we would expect the average to be 14.978 + 1.87 = 16.848, then day6: 18.718, day7: 20.588, day8: 22.458? \n\n        But that seems too steep and unrealistic. \n\n 34. We might be overfitting the last two days. The increase from day2 to day3 was:\n\n        day2: average of day2: \n            [10.130,9.708,9.919,9.708,8.864,9.778,9.778,9.919,10.130,8.442,10.200,7.809,9.989,7.668,10.341,10.411,10.693,10.482,9.919,9.145,8.793,8.371,6.894,6.120]\n            Sum = 10.130+9.708=19.838\n            +9.919=29.757\n            +9.708=39.465\n            +8.864=48.329\n            +9.778=58.107\n            +9.778=67.885\n            +9.919=77.804\n            +10.130=87.934\n            +8.442=96.376\n            +10.200=106.576\n            +7.809=114.385\n            +9.989=124.374\n            +7.668=132.042\n            +10.341=142.383\n            +10.411=152.794\n            +10.693=163.487\n            +10.482=173.969\n            +9.919=183.888\n            +9.145=193.033\n            +8.793=201.826\n            +8.371=210.197\n            +6.894=217.091\n            +6.120=223.211\n\n            Average = 223.211 / 24 = 9.30045833333\n\n        Then day3: 13.1079, so the jump from day2 to day3 was about 3.8, which is more than the jump from day3 to day4 (1.87). \n\n 35. Given the volatility, it might be better to use the average of the last two days as the pattern and not project the trend? \n\n 36. We decide to use the average of the last two days (day3 and day4) for each hour as the base pattern, and then use that same pattern for the next 4 days without any trend. \n\n 37. Why? Because the increasing trend might not continue (it might be a weekend effect? day2 was a Sunday and day3 Monday, day4 Tuesday). \n\n 38.

The input had 3 or 6? \n\n        Example: 10.693000 -> we can output 12.346000? But the input had 6 decimal places. However, the problem does not specify precision. \n\n        We'll output with 6 decimal places to match.\n\n 44. However, our computed values are averages and we have more precision. We'll round to 6 decimal places.\n\n 45. But note: the input had 6 decimal places, but the values are multiples of 0.001? Not exactly: we have 10.693000, 10.482000, etc.\n\n        We computed averages that are not necessarily multiples of 0.001, so we'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 46. Example: 12.346 -> 12.346000, 11.7475 -> 11.747500.\n\n 47. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        First 24 hours (2017-09-06):\n            00:00:00 -> 12.346000\n            01:00:00 -> 11.747500\n            02:00:00 -> 11.256000\n            03:00:00 -> 11.959000\n            04:00:00 -> 12.662500\n            05:00:00 -> 13.049500\n            06:00:00 -> 13.788000\n            07:00:00 -> 13.366000\n            08:00:00 -> 13.225000\n            09:00:00 -> 13.119500\n            10:00:00 -> 14.140000\n            11:00:00 -> 14.491500\n            12:00:00 -> 15.371000\n            13:00:00 -> 16.250500\n            14:00:00 -> 16.320500\n            15:00:00 -> 16.144500\n            16:00:00 -> 15.863500\n            17:00:00 -> 15.370500\n            18:00:00 -> 15.441000\n            19:00:00 -> 14.984000\n            20:00:00 -> 14.491500\n            21:00:00 -> 13.753000\n            22:00:00 -> 13.682500\n            23:00:00 -> 14.210000\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next three days.\n\n 48. But wait, we are using the same pattern for all four days? Yes.\n\n 49. We write the data in the same format.\n\n 50. However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 51. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-06 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-09-09 23:00:00\n\n 52. We'll write:\n\n        2017-09-06 00:00:00 <value>\n        2017-09-06 01:00:00 <value>\n        ...\n        2017-09-06 23:00:00 <value>\n        2017-09-07 00:00:00 <value as hour00 of the pattern>\n        ...\n\n 53. We use the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n 54. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-06 00:00:00 12.346000\n2017-09-06 01:00:00 11.747500\n... (and so on for 96 points)\n```\n\n 55. But note: the last two days (day3 and day4) are not exactly the same day of the week? We don't have day-of-week information. \n\n 56. Given the simplicity, we proceed.\n\n 57. We list the 24 base numbers:\n\n        base = [12.346, 11.7475, 11.256, 11.959, 12.6625, 13.0495, 13.788, 13.366, 13.225, 13.1195, 14.140, 14.4915, 15.371, 16.2505, 16.3205, 16.1445, 15.8635, 15.3705, 15.441, 14.984, 14.4915, 13.753, 13.6825, 14.210]\n\n 58. We'll format each to 6 decimal places by appending zeros if needed.\n\n 59. However, note: 12.346 -> 12.346000, 11.7475 -> 11.747500, etc.\n\n 60. We generate the next 96 points by repeating this list 4 times.\n\n 61. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n 62. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 63. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-06 00:00:00 12.346000\n2017-09-06 01:00:00 11.747500\n2017-09-06 02:00:00 11.256000\n2017-09-06 03:00:00 11.959000\n2017-09-06 04:00:00 12.662500\n2017-09-06 05:00:00 13.049500\n2017-09-06 06:00:00 13.788000\n2017-09-06 07:00:00 13.366000\n2017-09-06 08:00:00 13.225000\n2017-09-06 09:00:00 13.119500\n2017-09-06 10:00:00 14.140000\n2017-09-06 11:00:00 14.491500\n2017-09-06 12:00:00 15.371000\n2017-09-06 13:00:00 16.250500\n2017-09-06 14:00:00 16.320500\n2017-09-06 15:00:00 16.144500\n2017-09-06 16:00:00 15.863500\n2017-09-06 17:00:00 15.370500\n2017-09-06 18:00:00 15.441000\n2017-09-06 19:00:00 14.984000\n2017-09-06 20:00:00 14.491500\n2017-09-06 21:00:00 13.753000\n2017-09-06 22:00:00 13.682500\n2017-09-06 23:00:00 14.210000\n2017-09-07 00:00:00 12.346000\n2017-09-07 01:00:00 11.747500\n...

We output 96 lines.\n\n 67. We write the answer in the required XML-like tag.\n\n 68. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 69. We do as above.\n\n 70. However, note: this is a very naive forecast. In practice, we would use a more sophisticated model. But given the constraints, we use this.\n\n 71. We output the data.\n",
