        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some irregularities (like the drop at 07:00 on 2016-07-25).\n 2. Given the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days), we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality.\n 3. Since there might be missing values in the provided data, we should first check for missingness and impute if necessary. However, the provided 96 points are complete? Let's check:\n    - The data starts at 2016-07-25 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-07-28 23:00:00, which is exactly 4*24=96 points. So no missing in the given data.\n\n 4. We are to predict the next 96 points (from 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00).\n\n 5. We can use a model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 6. Given the data shows:\n    - A daily pattern: higher values during the night and lower during the day? Actually, looking at the data:\n        On 2016-07-25: \n          00:00: 12.117, then decreases until 07:00 (1.457) and 08:00 (0.107), then increases again until 12:00 (8.919) and then fluctuates.\n        It seems that the load drops significantly in the morning (around 7-10 AM) and then recovers.\n\n 7. We'll use an automated approach to select the best model parameters, but note that we are limited by the data length (only 96 points).\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Since the pattern seems to repeat daily, we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data does not look exactly the same every day. For example, the drop on 2016-07-25 at 07:00 is to 1.457 and 0.107, but on 2016-07-26 at 07:00 it's 8.066, and on 2016-07-27 at 07:00 it's 7.853, and 2016-07-28 at 07:00 is 8.848.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the last available day (2016-07-28) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would ignore the trend and variations.\n\n10. Given the complexity and the need for accuracy, we can use a model that automatically captures seasonality and trend. We'll use the `statsmodels` library in Python to fit a SARIMA model.\n\n However, note that we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a pre-defined method or a simple heuristic.\n\n11. Since I cannot run code here, I will use a simple averaging method that is often used in such settings:\n\n    For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 available days, and then use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for the averaging method:\n        - Group the data by hour of the day (so we have 24 groups).\n        - For each hour group (e.g., 00:00), we have 4 values (from day1, day2, day3, day4). We take the mean of these 4 values.\n        - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to see a long-term trend, so we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n12. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00):\n        Day1: 12.117\n        Day2: 11.016\n        Day3: 11.655\n        Day4: 14.178\n        Average = (12.117 + 11.016 + 11.655 + 14.178) / 4 = 12.2415\n\n    Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00):\n        Day1: 11.798\n        Day2: 11.762\n        Day3: 10.234\n        Day4: 13.077\n        Average = (11.798 + 11.762 + 10.234 + 13.077) / 4 = 11.71775\n\n    And so on.\n\n13. Then we will create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating these 24 hourly averages 4 times.\n\n14. However, note that the last provided day is 2016-07-28. The next 96 hours start at 2016-07-29 00:00:00 and end at 2016-08-01 23:00:00.\n\n15. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n16. But wait: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing. And we are to forecast the next 96. We are not told to impute the provided data because it is complete.\n\n17. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps and the corresponding MUFL values by the hourly average method.\n\n18. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n    We'll index the data by hour (0 to 23) and then for each hour, we have 4 values (from the 4 days).\n\n    We'll compute:\n\n        hour0: [12.117, 11.016, 11.655, 14.178] -> 12.2415\n        hour1: [11.798, 11.762, 10.234, 13.077] -> 11.71775\n        hour2: [11.727, 9.879, 10.234, 12.473] -> (11.727+9.879+10.234+12.473)/4 = 44.313/4 = 11.07825\n        hour3: [11.122, 10.270, 10.127, 10.874] -> (11.122+10.270+10.127+10.874)/4 = 42.393/4 = 10.59825\n        hour4: [9.737, 7.427, 10.234, 11.584] -> (9.737+7.427+10.234+11.584)/4 = 38.982/4 = 9.7455\n        hour5: [9.204, 7.640, 9.523, 11.727] -> (9.204+7.640+9.523+11.727)/4 = 38.094/4 = 9.5235\n        hour6: [8.635, 8.066, 9.559, 8.955] -> (8.635+8.066+9.559+8.955)/4 = 35.215/4 = 8.80375\n        hour7: [1.457, 8.066, 7.853, 8.848] -> (1.457+8.066+7.853+8.848)/4 = 26.224/4 = 6.556\n        hour8: [0.107, 8.457, 8.031, 7.889] -> (0.107+8.457+8.031+7.889)/4 = 24.484/4 = 6.121\n        hour9: [0.107, 8.422, 8.315, 8.706] -> (0.107+8.422+8.315+8.706)/4 = 25.55/4 = 6.3875\n        hour10: [0.142, 9.523, 9.808, 9.594] -> (0.142+9.523+9.808+9.594)/4 = 29.067/4 = 7.26675\n        hour11: [2.559, 9.559, 10.305, 9.594] -> (2.559+9.559+10.305+9.594)/4 = 32.017/4 = 8.00425\n        hour12: [8.919, 9.737, 10.341, 9.772] -> (8.919+9.737+10.341+9.772)/4 = 38.769/4 = 9.69225\n        hour13: [9.594, 9.879, 10.376, 11.265] -> (9.594+9.879+10.376+11.265)/4 = 41.114/4 = 10.2785\n        hour14: [9.097, 9.701, 10.376, 10.234] -> (9.097+9.701+10.376+10.234)/4 = 39.408/4 = 9.852\n        hour15: [9.061, 9.239, 10.518, 10.163] -> (9.061+9.239+10.518+10.163)/4 = 38.981/4 = 9.74525\n        hour16: [8.599, 8.990, 8.955, 9.417] -> (8.599+8.990+8.955+9.417)/4 = 35.961/4 = 8.99025\n        hour17: [8.493, 8.671, 8.706, 8.706] -> (8.493+8.671+8.706+8.706)/4 = 34.576/4 = 8.644\n        hour18: [8.138, 8.351, 8.351, 8.528] -> (8.138+8.351+8.351+8.528)/4 = 33.368/4 = 8.342\n        hour19: [8.635, 8.919, 9.132, 9.594] -> (8.635+8.919+9.132+9.594)/4 = 36.28/4 = 9.07\n        hour20: [11.158, 11.869, 12.082, 11.762] -> (11.158+11.869+12.082+11.762)/4 = 46.871/4 = 11.71775\n        hour21: [11.229, 10.803, 11.620, 11.655] -> (11.229+10.803+11.620+11.655)/4 = 45.307/4 = 11.32675\n        hour22: [11.798, 11.691, 13.326, 11.549] -> (11.798+11.691+13.326+11.549)/4 = 48.364/4 = 12.091\n        hour23: [11.407, 11.655, 14.711, 12.437] -> (11.407+11.655+14.711+12.437)/4 = 50.21/4 = 12.5525\n\n19. Now, we create the next 4 days (from 2016-07-29 to 2016-08-01) by repeating these 24 averages 4 times.\n\n    Day1: 2016-07-29\n        hour0: 12.2415\n        hour1: 11.71775\n        ... until hour23: 12.5525\n\n    Day2: 2016-07-30: same 24 values\n    Day3: 2016-07-31: same 24 values\n    Day4: 2016-08-01: same 24 values\n\n20. Format the dates:\n\n    Start: 2016-07-29 00:00:00\n    Then 2016-07-29 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-01 23:00:00.\n\n21. We must output the data in the same format as the input: two columns (date and MUFL) with the MUFL values rounded to 3 decimal places (as in the input).\n\n22. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n    hour0: 12.2415 -> 12.242\n    hour1: 11.71775 -> 11.718\n    hour2: 11.07825 -> 11.078\n    hour3: 10.59825 -> 10.598\n    hour4: 9.7455 -> 9.746\n    hour5: 9.5235 -> 9.524\n    hour6: 8.80375 -> 8.804\n    hour7: 6.556 -> 6.556\n    hour8: 6.121 -> 6.121\n    hour9: 6.3875 -> 6.388\n    hour10: 7.26675 -> 7.267\n    hour11: 8.00425 -> 8.004\n    hour12: 9.69225 -> 9.692\n    hour13: 10.2785 -> 10.279\n    hour14: 9.852 -> 9.852\n    hour15: 9.74525 -> 9.745\n    hour16: 8.99025 -> 8.990\n    hour17: 8.644 -> 8.644\n    hour18: 8.342 -> 8.342\n    hour19: 9.07 -> 9.070\n    But note: 9.07 is 9.070? Actually, the average was 9.07 exactly? We computed 36.28/4=9.07 -> so 9.070\n    However, let me check: 8.635+8.919+9.132+9.594 = 36.28 -> 36.28/4=9.07 -> so we write 9.070\n\n    hour20: 11.71775 -> 11.718\n    hour21: 11.32675 -> 11.327\n    hour22: 12.091 -> 12.091\n    hour23: 12.5525 -> 12.553\n\n23. Now, we'll generate the next 96 points:\n\n    Day1: 2016-07-29\n        00:00:00 -> 12.242\n        01:00:00 -> 11.718\n        02:00:00 -> 11.078\n        03:00:00 -> 10.598\n        04:00:00 -> 9.746\n        05:00:00 -> 9.524\n        06:00:00 -> 8.804\n        07:00:00 -> 6.556\n        08:00:00 -> 6.121\n        09:00:00 -> 6.388\n        10:00:00 -> 7.267\n        11:00:00 -> 8.004\n        12:00:00 -> 9.692\n        13:00:00 -> 10.279\n        14:00:00 -> 9.852\n        15:00:00 -> 9.745\n        16:00:00 -> 8.990\n        17:00:00 -> 8.644\n        18:00:00 -> 8.342\n        19:00:00 -> 9.070\n        20:00:00 -> 11.718\n        21:00:00 -> 11.327\n        22:00:00 -> 12.091\n        23:00:00 -> 12.553\n\n    Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n24. We must generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2016-07-29 00:00:00\n    Then 2016-07-29 01:00:00, ... until 2016-07-29 23:00:00\n    Then 2016-07-30 00:00:00 ... until 2016-07-30 23:00:00\n    Then 2016-07-31 00:00:00 ... until 2016-07-31 23:00:00\n    Then 2016-08-01 00:00:00 ... until 2016-08-01 23:00:00\n\n25. We write the data in the required format.\n\nNote: This method is simple and may not capture potential trends or changes, but with only 4 days of history, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\nLet's write the output.\n",
