        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and shows a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality). \n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete. \n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days) and we have a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n For forecasting, we assume that the model we build can handle the pattern and we will generate 96 future points.\n\n Given the constraints and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we can use a simple but effective method:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal Naive Method - using the last available season (last day) as the forecast for the next days? But note: the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n Option 2: We can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. However, we are limited to 96 points (only 4 days) which is very little for training a seasonal model with 24 seasons.\n\n Option 3: Given the small data, we can also consider using the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern but also a trend? Let's check:\n\n Looking at the data: \n   The values at 00:00: 8.372, 6.296, 7.569, 6.966 -> not a clear trend? \n   The values at 12:00: 9.511, 8.506, 7.770, 8.038 -> also not a clear trend.\n\n However, we can observe that the pattern repeats roughly every 24 hours.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can compute the average for each hour of the day and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n   - We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n   - We compute the mean for each hour (ignoring any missing values if present, but in our case there are none).\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. \n   If we were to handle missing values in the training data, we would have to impute. But the problem does not specify any missing in the given 96.\n\n However, the forecast must be for the next 96 points (4 days) and we are to provide the complete data.\n\n Let's do:\n\n   For hour 0: (8.372 + 6.296 + 7.569 + 6.966) / 4 = 7.30075\n   For hour 1: (7.770 + 6.765 + 8.372 + 6.899) / 4 = 7.4515\n   ... and so on.\n\n Then we repeat this 4 times (for the next 4 days) to get 96 points.\n\n But note: the last day in the data is 2017-08-24. The next day is 2017-08-25? \n\n However, we must be cautious: the data in the same hour of different days might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-24) as the base and adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n But the problem does not specify a method. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have very few data points, the hourly average over the 4 days is a reasonable approach.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"High UseLess Load\" and the values seem to fluctuate. We don't have any external variables.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We'll group by the time of day (hour) and take the mean.\n\n Steps:\n\n   hour0: [8.372, 6.296, 7.569, 6.966] -> mean = (8.372+6.296+7.569+6.966)/4 = 7.30075\n   hour1: [7.770, 6.765, 8.372, 6.899] -> mean = (7.770+6.765+8.372+6.899)/4 = 7.4515\n   hour2: [7.971, 6.363, 7.167, 6.966] -> mean = (7.971+6.363+7.167+6.966)/4 = 7.11675\n   hour3: [7.837, 6.229, 6.631, 6.497] -> mean = (7.837+6.229+6.631+6.497)/4 = 6.7985\n   hour4: [8.105, 5.693, 7.569, 6.430] -> mean = (8.105+5.693+7.569+6.430)/4 = 6.94925\n   hour5: [7.234, 6.899, 6.966, 6.028] -> mean = (7.234+6.899+6.966+6.028)/4 = 6.78175\n   hour6: [7.904, 5.492, 5.961, 7.033] -> mean = (7.904+5.492+5.961+7.033)/4 = 6.5975\n   hour7: [8.239, 6.363, 6.698, 6.765] -> mean = (8.239+6.363+6.698+6.765)/4 = 7.01625\n   hour8: [8.774, 5.157, 6.899, 6.899] -> mean = (8.774+5.157+6.899+6.899)/4 = 6.93225\n   hour9: [7.837, 5.827, 6.095, 6.296] -> mean = (7.837+5.827+6.095+6.296)/4 = 6.51375\n   hour10: [9.779, 6.832, 7.234, 7.837] -> mean = (9.779+6.832+7.234+7.837)/4 = 7.9205\n   hour11: [10.114, 8.640, 8.439, 7.368] -> mean = (10.114+8.640+8.439+7.368)/4 = 8.64025\n   hour12: [9.511, 8.506, 7.770, 8.038] -> mean = (9.511+8.506+7.770+8.038)/4 = 8.45625\n   hour13: [7.636, 8.573, 8.506, 8.774] -> mean = (7.636+8.573+8.506+8.774)/4 = 8.37225\n   hour14: [8.707, 8.640, 7.837, 8.105] -> mean = (8.707+8.640+7.837+8.105)/4 = 8.32225\n   hour15: [7.837, 7.368, 6.497, 6.430] -> mean = (7.837+7.368+6.497+6.430)/4 = 7.033\n   hour16: [6.229, 5.425, 5.492, 4.890] -> mean = (6.229+5.425+5.492+4.890)/4 = 5.509\n   hour17: [6.363, 4.220, 4.622, 4.890] -> mean = (6.363+4.220+4.622+4.890)/4 = 5.02375\n   hour18: [4.287, 4.622, 4.354, 3.952] -> mean = (4.287+4.622+4.354+3.952)/4 = 4.30375\n   hour19: [4.421, 5.224, 4.086, 4.220] -> mean = (4.421+5.224+4.086+4.220)/4 = 4.48775\n   hour20: [5.693, 5.492, 5.358, 5.090] -> mean = (5.693+5.492+5.358+5.090)/4 = 5.40825\n   hour21: [5.090, 4.823, 7.301, 5.559] -> mean = (5.090+4.823+7.301+5.559)/4 = 5.69325\n   hour22: [5.358, 5.894, 6.497, 7.100] -> mean = (5.358+5.894+6.497+7.100)/4 = 6.21225\n   hour23: [5.492, 6.832, 7.100, 7.636] -> mean = (5.492+6.832+7.100+7.636)/4 = 6.765\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2017-08-25 to 2017-08-28) we assign:\n\n   2017-08-25 00:00:00 -> 7.30075\n   2017-08-25 01:00:00 -> 7.4515\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the training set, so we don't need to impute for training.\n\n However, the forecast must be complete.\n\n We'll generate the numbers and round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input has 3 decimal places? Actually, the input has 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model? But with only 4 days, it's hard. The average per hour is a common baseline.\n\n Let's consider: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all in a row) and no day of week information. So we ignore.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of 24 average values (for hour0 to hour23) and then repeat that list 4 times.\n\n   The next 96 hours:\n\n      Day1: 25th Aug 2017: from 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 hours\n      Day2: 26th Aug 2017: 24 hours\n      Day3: 27th Aug 2017: 24 hours\n      Day4: 28th Aug 2017: 24 hours\n\n   Total 96.\n\n   We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   The last date in the input is 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n\n   The next date is 2017-08-25 00:00:00.\n\n   We can use pandas to generate the date range? But we are to output in the same format.\n\n   We'll be:\n\n        date                  HULL\n        2017-08-25 00:00:00  7.301\n        2017-08-25 01:00:00  7.452\n        ...\n\n   We round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's compute the averages and round:\n\n   hour0: 7.30075 -> 7.301\n   hour1: 7.4515  -> 7.452\n   hour2: 7.11675 -> 7.117\n   hour3: 6.7985  -> 6.799\n   hour4: 6.94925 -> 6.949\n   hour5: 6.78175 -> 6.782\n   hour6: 6.5975  -> 6.598\n   hour7: 7.01625 -> 7.016\n   hour8: 6.93225 -> 6.932\n   hour9: 6.51375 -> 6.514\n   hour10: 7.9205 -> 7.921\n   hour11: 8.64025 -> 8.640\n   hour12: 8.45625 -> 8.456\n   hour13: 8.37225 -> 8.372\n   hour14: 8.32225 -> 8.322\n   hour15: 7.033 -> 7.033\n   hour16: 5.509 -> 5.509\n   hour17: 5.02375 -> 5.024\n   hour18: 4.30375 -> 4.304\n   hour19: 4.48775 -> 4.488\n   hour20: 5.40825 -> 5.408\n   hour21: 5.69325 -> 5.693\n   hour22: 6.21225 -> 6.212\n   hour23: 6.765 -> 6.765\n\n Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n   end:   2017-08-28 23:00:00\n\n We can generate the dates by:\n\n   base = datetime(2017, 8, 25)\n   then for day in range(0,4):\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date = base + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n\n But note: the input data ends at 2017-08-24 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-08-25 00:00:00.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data is sampled every hour? Yes, hourly.\n\n Let's code the output.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\".\n\n We'll output 96 lines.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\n2017-08-25 00:00:00  7.301\n2017-08-25 01:00:00  7.452\n... (until 2017-08-28 23:00:00)\n```\n\n    </answer>\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n But the forecast is for the average of the past 4 days for each hour. This is a simple and common approach.\n\n Let's generate the data.\n\n We'll create a list of the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n But note: the rounding we did above.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the average and then round to 3 decimals in code.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   averages = [ \n        round((8.372+6.296+7.569+6.966)/4, 3),\n        round((7.770+6.765+8.372+6.899)/4, 3),\n        ... \n   ]\n\n But to avoid manual, we can compute from the data? But the data is given as text.\n\n Since the data is small, we can parse the provided data and compute the average for each hour.\n\n However, the problem says we are to forecast and we are given the data. We are to output the next 96.\n\n We have already computed the 24 averages.\n\n We'll write the 96 points.\n\n But note: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 = 96).\n\n We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-08-25 01:00:00 ... until 2017-08-25 23:00:00 -> day0\n   Then 2017-08-26 00:00:00 ... until 2017-08-26 23:00:00 -> day1\n   Then 2017-08-27 00:00:00 ... until 2017-08-27 23:00:00 -> day2\n   Then 2017-08-28 00:00:00 ... until 2017-08-28 23:00:00 -> day3\n\n We'll assign the hour0 average to 00:00, hour1 to 01:00, etc.\n\n We'll output:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2017-08-25 00:00:00 7.301\n        2017-08-25 01:00:00 7.452\n        ...\n\n We'll do this for 4 days.\n\n Let's write the code in our mind:\n\n   averages = [7.301, 7.452, 7.117, 6.799, 6.949, 6.782, 6.598, 7.016, 6.932, 6.514, 7.921, 8.640, 8.456, 8.372, 8.322, 7.033, 5.509, 5.024, 4.304, 4.488, 5.408, 5.693, 6.212, 6.765]\n\n   for day in range(0,4):\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n            value = averages[hour]\n\n   But we must format the date as string: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   The start_date is 2017-08-25 00:00:00.\n\n   We can generate:\n\n        day0: 2017-08-25\n        day1: 2017-08-26\n        day2: 2017-08-27\n        day3: 2017-08-28\n\n   We'll write 96 lines.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
