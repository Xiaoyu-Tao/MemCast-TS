        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-08-22 00:00:00 to 2016-08-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input. Since the given data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same format.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a suitable model. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps (which is multiple steps ahead), \n we can use models like:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because of the hourly pattern and potential daily seasonality (seasonality period = 24).\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n   - Or a machine learning model, but we are limited by the data and the requirement to forecast 96 points.\n\n However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) to train on. This is a very short history. Therefore, we must choose a model that can work with limited data.\n\n Given the constraints, we are not going to run actual code, but we must simulate the process.\n\n Considering the data:\n   - There is a daily pattern: note that each day the load drops during the night and rises during the evening? \n     For example, on 2016-08-18, the HUFL starts at around 20.9, drops to around 14-16 during the day, then rises again in the evening to 22.17 and then drops again at night.\n   - The next days show a similar pattern but with variations.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture:\n   - A daily seasonality (period=24)\n\n We can use a simple seasonal naive model: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? \n But note: the last day (2016-08-21) might not be a typical day? \n\n Alternatively, we can average the same hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast? \n\n However, the problem says we are experts and we must account for potential missing values. Since the given data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's look at the overall level:\n\n 2016-08-18: min ~11.387, max ~22.17\n 2016-08-19: min ~13.262, max ~23.64\n 2016-08-20: min ~7.904, max ~22.70\n 2016-08-21: min ~9.377, max ~15.74\n\n The pattern is not very stable. The 20th has a drop during the day (down to 7.9) and the 21st doesn't recover as much in the evening.\n\n Given the complexity and the short history, we might use a model that can adapt quickly. \n\n However, the problem does not require us to specify the model, only to provide the forecast.\n\n Since we must provide the complete data, we will generate 96 values.\n\n Considering the above, we decide to use a simple method: \n   - We will use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data has 4 days? \n   Day1: 2016-08-18 (00:00 to 23:00) -> 24 hours\n   Day2: 2016-08-19\n   Day3: 2016-08-20\n   Day4: 2016-08-21\n\n We have 4 days. So for hour 00:00, we have 4 values: \n   2016-08-18 00:00: 20.898001\n   2016-08-19 00:00: 21.166000\n   2016-08-20 00:00: 19.759001\n   2016-08-21 00:00: 14.602000\n\n The average for 00:00: (20.898001 + 21.166000 + 19.759001 + 14.602000) / 4 = 19.1062505\n\n Similarly, we compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average over the 4 days.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n   Day1 (2016-08-22): use the computed average for each hour (0 to 23)\n   Day2 (2016-08-23): same as Day1 (because we only have 4 days and we are using the same pattern)\n   Day3 (2016-08-24): same\n   Day4 (2016-08-25): same\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are told to be aware, but the provided data is complete. \n   So we use the above.\n\n However, let's check if there is a trend? The last day (2016-08-21) has lower values. We might want to adjust for a downward trend? \n   But with only 4 days, it's hard to say. We can use a moving average without trend adjustment.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-08-21) as the forecast? But that would ignore the previous days.\n\n Considering the requirement for 96 points and the simplicity, we go with the average by hour.\n\n Steps for calculation:\n\n   For hour h (0<=h<24):\n        avg_h = (value_h of day1 + value_h of day2 + value_h of day3 + value_h of day4) / 4\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign:\n        Day1, hour h: avg_h\n        Day2, hour h: avg_h\n        Day3, hour h: avg_h\n        Day4, hour h: avg_h\n\n But note: the pattern might be changing. However, without more data, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   Hour0 (00:00): [20.898001, 21.166000, 19.759001, 14.602000] -> (20.898001+21.166000+19.759001+14.602000)/4 = 76.425002/4 = 19.1062505\n   Hour1 (01:00): [19.089001, 19.156000, 19.959999, 15.070000] -> (19.089001+19.156000+19.959999+15.070000)/4 = 73.275/4 = 18.31875\n   ... and so on.\n\n However, note that the data for 2016-08-21 23:00:00 15.740000 is the last point.\n\n We must generate 96 points: from 2016-08-22 00:00:00 to 2016-08-25 23:00:00.\n\n We'll compute the 24 hourly averages and then repeat the same pattern for 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not told that the next 96 will have missing values? \n   We are to provide the complete data, meaning we must fill in the forecast for every hour. So we are generating 96 points without missing values.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Group the given data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n   Step 2: Create the next 96 timestamps: \n        Start: 2016-08-22 00:00:00 (the next day after 2016-08-21 23:00:00)\n        Then hourly until 2016-08-25 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 = 96 hours)\n\n   Step 3: For each hour in the forecast period, assign the average value corresponding to that hour.\n\n However, note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can compute the average for each of the 24 hours by:\n\n        hour0_avg = (row0 + row24 + row48 + row72) / 4\n        hour1_avg = (row1 + row25 + row49 + row73) / 4\n        ... \n\n   Then for the forecast:\n        row96 (2016-08-22 00:00:00) = hour0_avg\n        row97 (2016-08-22 01:00:00) = hour1_avg\n        ...\n        row119 (2016-08-22 23:00:00) = hour23_avg\n        row120 (2016-08-23 00:00:00) = hour0_avg\n        ... and so on.\n\n Let's do the calculation for the first few hours:\n\n   Hour0 (00:00): \n        indices: 0, 24, 48, 72 -> 20.898001, 21.166000, 19.759001, 14.602000 -> sum=76.425002 -> avg=19.1062505\n\n   Hour1 (01:00):\n        indices: 1, 25, 49, 73 -> 19.089001, 19.156000, 19.959999, 15.070000 -> \n        19.089001+19.156000 = 38.245001; 19.959999+15.070000=35.029999; total=73.275 -> avg=18.31875\n\n   Hour2 (02:00):\n        indices: 2,26,50,74 -> 16.476999, 19.558001, 17.816999, 13.798000 -> \n        16.476999+19.558001=36.035; 17.816999+13.798000=31.614999; total=67.65 -> avg=16.9125\n\n   Hour3 (03:00):\n        indices: 3,27,51,75 -> 16.544001, 17.951000, 17.281000, 13.329000 -> \n        16.544001+17.951000=34.495001; 17.281000+13.329000=30.61; total=65.105001 -> avg=16.27625025\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the data we are given is exactly 4 days? \n        Day1: 0-23\n        Day2: 24-47\n        Day3: 48-71\n        Day4: 72-95\n\n We have 96 points, so index 0 to 95.\n\n We can write a small program in our mind to compute the 24 averages.\n\n But since we are an expert, we can compute and then write the forecast.\n\n However, note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n We'll compute the 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) and then assign:\n\n   Day1 (2016-08-22): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n   Day2 (2016-08-23): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n   Day3 (2016-08-24): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n   Day4 (2016-08-25): [avg0, avg1, ..., avg23]\n\n We'll round to 6 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input has up to 6 decimal places? \n        Example: 20.898001 -> 6 decimal places.\n\n We'll keep the same precision.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the average might have more decimals.

You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We are providing the next 96 dates and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-22 00:00:00 19.106251\n2016-08-22 01:00:00 18.318750\n2016-08-22 02:00:00 16.912500\n2016-08-22 03:00:00 16.276250\n2016-08-22 04:00:00 15.338500\n2016-08-22 05:00:00 14.685250\n2016-08-22 06:00:00 14.953000\n2016-08-22 07:00:00 14.852750\n2016-08-22 08:00:00 13.630500\n2016-08-22 09:00:00 13.379250\n2016-08-22 10:00:00 14.283750\n2016-08-22 11:00:00 14.166250\n2016-08-22 12:00:00 13.329000\n2016-08-22 13:00:00 14.099500\n2016-08-22 14:00:00 13.479750\n2016-08-22 15:00:00 13.178250\n2016-08-22 16:00:00 12.157000\n2016-08-22 17:00:00 12.508750\n2016-08-22 18:00:00 10.917750\n2016-08-22 19:00:00 12.290750\n2016-08-22 20:00:00 16.627750\n2016-08-22 21:00:00 16.694750\n2016-08-22 22:00:00 18.453000\n2016-08-22 23:00:00 18.921750\n2016-08-23 00:00:00 19.106251\n2016-08-23 01:00:00 18.318750\n2016-08-23 02:00:00 16.912500\n2016-08-23 03:00:00 16.276250\n2016-08-23 04:00:00 15.338500\n2016-08-23 05:00:00 14.685250\n2016-08-23 06:00:00 14.953000\n2016-08-23 07:00:00 14.852750\n2016-08-23 08:00:00 13.630500\n2016-08-23 09:00:00 13.379250\n2016-08-23 10:00:00 14.283750\n2016-08-23 11:00:00 14.166250\n2016-08-23 12:00:00 13.329000\n2016-08-23 13:00:00 14.099500\n2016-08-23 14:00:00 13.479750\n2016-08-23 15:00:00 13.178250\n2016-08-23 16:00:00 12.157000\n2016-08-23 17:00:00 12.508750\n2016-08-23 18:00:00 10.917750\n2016-08-23 19:00:00 12.290750\n2016-08-23 20:00:00 16.627750\n2016-08-23 21:00:00 16.694750\n2016-08-23 22:00:00 18.453000\n2016-08-23 23:00:00 18.921750\n2016-08-24 00:00:00 19.106251\n2016-08-24 01:00:00 18.318750\n2016-08-24 02:00:00 16.912500\n2016-08-24 03:00:00 16.276250\n2016-08-24 04:00:00 15.338500\n2016-08-24 05:00:00 14.685250\n2016-08-24 06:00:00 14.953000\n2016-08-24 07:00:00 14.852750\n2016-08-24 08:00:00 13.630500\n2016-08-24 09:00:00 13.379250\n2016-08-24 10:00:00 14.283750\n2016-08-24 11:00:00 14.166250\n2016-08-24 12:00:00 13.329000\n2016-08-24 13:00:00 14.099500\n2016-08-24 14:00:00 13.479750\n2016-08-24 15:00:00 13.178250\n2016-08-24 16:00:00 12.157000\n2016-08-24 17:00:00 12.508750\n2016-08-24 18:00:00 10.917750\n2016-08-24 19:00:00 12.290750\n2016-08-24 20:00:00 16.627750\n2016-08-24 21:00:00 16.694750\n2016-08-24 22:00:00 18.453000\n2016-08-24 23:00:00 18.921750\n2016-08-25 00:00:00 19.106251\n2016-08-25 01:00:00 18.318750\n2016-08-25 02:00:00 16.912500\n2016-08-25 03:00:00 16.276250\n2016-08-25 04:00:00 15.338500\n2016-08-25 05:00:00 14.685250\n2016-08-25 06:00:00 14.953000\n2016-08-25 07:00:00 14.852750\n2016-08-25 08:00:00 13.630500\n2016-08-25 09:00:00 13.379250\n2016-08-25 10:00:00 14.283750\n2016-08-25 11:00:00 14.166250\n2016-08-25 12:00:00 13.329000\n2016-08-25 13:00:00 14.099500\n2016-08-25 14:00:00 13.479750\n2016-08-25 15:00:00 13.178250\n2016-08-25 16:00:00 12.157000\n2016-08-25 17:00:00 12.508750\n2016-08-25 18:00:00 10.917750\n2016-08-25 19:00:00 12.290750\n2016-08-25 20:00:00 16.627750\n2016-08-25 21:00:00 16.694750\n2016-08-25 22:00:00 18.453000\n2016-08-25 23:00:00 18.921750\n```\n\n    </answer>\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
