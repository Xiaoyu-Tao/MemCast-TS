        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have been given a complete block.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 consecutive hourly timestamps starting from 2017-01-05 00:00:00.\n\n 3. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the data is relatively short (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon for such short history),\n      we must choose a model that can handle this.\n\n    - Given the data shows some patterns (daily seasonality?): we can observe that the values are negative and there are fluctuations throughout the day.\n\n    - We can try to use a model that captures seasonality. Since the data is hourly and we see a daily pattern (24 hours), we can set the seasonality to 24.\n\n    - However, with only 4 days of data, it's challenging to capture weekly seasonality (which would be 168 hours) but we don't have that much data.\n\n    - We can use a simple model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonality. But note: the data is non-stationary? Let's check the pattern.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use a model like Prophet by Facebook, which is robust to missing data and handles seasonality well, but we are limited to 4 days of history.\n\n    - Given the constraints, we are not allowed to use complex models that require long history, we might use a naive seasonal method or a simple average.\n\n    - However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a model that can capture the patterns.\n\n    - Since the data is only 96 points, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal component (SARIMA) with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24). But fitting a SARIMA with 24 seasonality on 96 points might be too heavy and we have only 4 seasons.\n\n    - Another idea: use a rolling window of the last 24 hours to predict the next 24 hours? But we need 96 hours.\n\n    - We can break the forecast into 4 chunks of 24 hours, each using the corresponding hour from the previous days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n    - However, the data does not look exactly the same every day. Let's see:\n\n        Day1: min around -3.02, max around 0.036\n        Day2: min around -3.376, max around 0.391\n        Day3: min around -2.523, max around 0.391\n        Day4: min around -2.878, max around -0.391? (we see -0.497 and then -0.746, but also -0.391 and -0.995)\n\n    - The pattern: each day seems to have a similar shape? Let's try to compute the average day.\n\n    - We can calculate the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the pattern for the next day? But then we have 4 days to forecast.\n\n    - Given the complexity and the short history, I propose to use a seasonal naive method: \n        For each hour in the next 96 hours, we have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n        We can use the value from the same hour of the previous day? But we have 4 days of history. We can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n    - However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = mean of 24 hours: \n            Let me compute: \n                Day1: \n                    [-0.020875] (I did a quick average in mind, but let me calculate properly: \n                    -0.959,0.036,-0.142,-0.497,-0.142,-0.817,-1.279,-0.782,-0.888,-1.777,-0.782,-1.244,-2.416,-2.132,-1.741,-1.137,-2.416,-2.878,-2.559,-3.020,-2.807,-2.843,-2.274,-1.848\n                    Sum = -44.289, mean = -1.845375\n\n                Day2: \n                    -1.599,-1.812,-1.421,-1.457,-1.599,-0.888,-2.594,-2.061,-1.670,-1.386,-1.670,-1.102,-1.919,-0.959,-1.599,-1.670,-1.599,-2.345,-2.061,-2.132,-2.310,-3.376,-0.497,-0.604\n                    Sum = -40.21, mean = -1.6754167\n\n                Day3:\n                    0.000,0.391,0.249,0.178,0.000,-0.249,-0.462,-0.071,0.000,-1.208,-1.102,-1.315,-2.061,-1.670,-1.635,-2.203,-1.883,-1.990,-1.848,-2.132,-2.132,-2.523,-1.848,-1.421\n                    Sum = -25.225, mean = -1.0510417\n\n                Day4:\n                    -1.599,-1.173,-1.528,-0.497,-0.746,-1.173,-1.670,-0.782,-0.391,-1.421,-1.244,-1.635,-2.097,-1.848,-1.919,-1.670,-2.203,-2.452,-2.345,-2.381,-2.416,-2.878,-0.995,-1.137\n                    Sum = -36.32, mean = -1.513333\n\n            The means are: -1.845, -1.675, -1.051, -1.513 -> there is a trend? It went up (less negative) then down? Not a clear trend.\n\n    - Given the above, we can try to use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    - How: \n        For hour 00:00: average of [2017-01-01 00:00:00, 2017-01-02 00:00:00, 2017-01-03 00:00:00, 2017-01-04 00:00:00] = (-0.959 + -1.599 + 0.000 + -1.599)/4 = (-5.157)/4 = -1.28925\n        Then for the next 4 days at 00:00:00, we use this average? But that would be the same for each day.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use the last value of the same hour from the last day? But that would be the same as the last day repeated.\n\n    - Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the last two days? \n\n    - However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We have to make a decision.\n\n    - Considering the data is short and we are experts, we can use a simple model. Let's use a seasonal naive model that uses the last available day (day4) as the pattern for the next day? Then for the next 4 days, we repeat day4? But that would be:\n\n        Day5: same as day4\n        Day6: same as day4\n        Day7: same as day4\n        Day8: same as day4\n\n    - But that ignores any trend. However, we don't have a clear trend.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour? Then the next 4 days will be the same: each day is the average of the 4 days for that hour.\n\n    - Let me compare: \n        Option1: Repeat the last day (day4) for the next 4 days.\n        Option2: Use the average of the 4 days for each hour and repeat that for 4 days.\n\n    - We can also consider a drift? But that might not be necessary.\n\n    - Since the problem does not specify the model, and we are to provide a forecast, I choose Option2: because it smooths out the noise and uses all the data.\n\n    - Steps for Option2:\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n        Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average for hour0 to the 00:00 of each day, hour1 to 01:00, etc.\n\n    - Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n        Values: \n            2017-01-01 00:00:00: -0.959\n            2017-01-02 00:00:00: -1.599\n            2017-01-03 00:00:00: 0.000\n            2017-01-04 00:00:00: -1.599\n        Average: (-0.959 -1.599 + 0.000 -1.599) / 4 = (-5.157) /4 = -1.28925\n\n    - Then for the next 4 days at 00:00:00 (i.e., 2017-01-05 00:00:00, 2017-01-06 00:00:00, 2017-01-07 00:00:00, 2017-01-08 00:00:00) we use -1.28925.\n\n    - Similarly for hour1 (01:00:00):\n        Values: 0.036, -1.812, 0.391, -1.173 -> (0.036 -1.812 + 0.391 -1.173) /4 = (-2.558)/4 = -0.6395\n\n    - And so on.\n\n    - This will give us 24 average values, and then we repeat the same 24 values for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 4. Implementation:\n\n    - We will create a list of the 24 hourly averages.\n\n    - Then, we generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-01-05 00:00:00, then 2017-01-05 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n\n    - For each day in the next 4 days, we assign the 24 averages in order.\n\n 5. But note: the data we are given ends at 2017-01-04 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2017-01-05 00:00:00.\n\n 6.

However, note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places? But the problem does not specify. \n    Since the input had 3 decimals, we output 3 decimals.\n\n    So we round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Let me recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: -1.03925 -> -1.039\n        hour1: -0.6395 -> -0.640 (if we round half up: 0.5 rounds up, so -0.6395: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal: 9 becomes 10 -> so -0.640)\n\n        But note: negative numbers: rounding -0.6395: \n            The absolute value is 0.6395, which rounds to 0.640, so the negative is -0.640.\n\n        We'll do for each.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the exact value and format to 3 decimals. But note: the original data had up to 3 decimals.\n\n    We'll compute the average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n    Let me recalc the averages and round:\n\n        hour0: (-0.959 -1.599 +0 -1.599)/4 = (-4.157)/4 = -1.03925 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            -1.039 (since 2 is in the thousandths and next is 5 -> but wait: 1.03925: the third decimal is 9, the fourth is 2 -> so we don't round up? \n            Actually, 1.03925: the digit in the thousandths place is 9, and the next digit is 2 which is less than 5, so we leave it as 1.039 -> then negative: -1.039.\n\n        But wait, the calculation: \n            -0.959 -1.599 = -2.558\n            -2.558 + 0 = -2.558\n            -2.558 -1.599 = -4.157\n            -4.157 / 4 = -1.03925 -> rounding to 3 decimals: look at the fourth decimal (2) -> so we round to -1.039.\n\n        hour1: (0.036 -1.812 +0.391 -1.173) = (-2.558) /4 = -0.6395 -> rounding: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal: 9 becomes 10 -> so we get -0.640.\n\n        We'll do similarly for others.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the exact fraction and then round. We'll do that.\n\n    We'll compute the average for each hour and then round to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Let me recalc all with rounding:\n\n        hour0: -1.03925 -> -1.039\n        hour1: -0.6395 -> -0.640\n        hour2: -0.7105 -> -0.710 (because 0.7105: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal? \n            Actually, 0.7105: the third decimal is 0, the fourth is 5 -> we round up the 0 to 1? \n            But wait: 0.7105: the digits are: tenths:7, hundredths:1, thousandths:0, ten-thousandths:5.\n            Rounding: we look at the thousandths place (0) and the next digit is 5 -> we round up the thousandths to 1? \n            So 0.7105 becomes 0.711? Then negative: -0.711.\n\n        But let me check: \n            The rule: round half up: \n                0.7105: \n                    We want 3 decimal places: so we look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> then we round the 3rd decimal (0) up to 1 -> 0.711.\n\n            So hour2: -0.7105 -> -0.711\n\n        Similarly, hour3: -0.56825 -> \n            The fourth decimal is 2 -> so we leave as -0.568\n\n        hour4: -0.62175 -> \n            fourth decimal is 7 -> which is >=5, so we round up the third decimal: 1 becomes 2 -> -0.622\n\n        We must be consistent.\n\n    We'll write a function to round to 3 decimals? But we are doing by hand.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the following rule: \n        value = round(avg, 3)   # which in Python uses round half to even? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n    Since the problem is in a professional context, we use standard rounding (round half up).\n\n    We'll recalc all 24 hours with rounding to 3 decimals using round half up.\n\n    Steps for each hour:\n        Compute the average (as above) and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n    Let me do it:\n\n        hour0: -1.03925 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            -1.039   (because the 4th decimal is 2, which is <5, so we leave the 3rd decimal as is)\n\n        hour1: -0.6395 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> we round up the 3rd decimal: 9 becomes 10 -> so we have to carry: \n            -0.6395: the 3rd decimal is 9, adding 1 makes it 10 -> so we get -0.640\n\n        hour2: -0.7105 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> we round up the 3rd decimal: 0 becomes 1 -> -0.711\n\n        hour3: -0.56825 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> so -0.568\n\n        hour4: -0.62175 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 1 becomes 2 -> -0.622\n\n        hour5: -0.78175 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 7 -> round up: 1 becomes 2 -> -0.782\n\n        hour6: -1.50125 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -1.501\n\n        hour7: -0.924 -> already 3 decimals? Actually, -0.924 is -0.9240 -> so -0.924\n\n        hour8: -0.73725 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 7 becomes 8 -> -0.738\n\n        hour9: -1.448 -> -1.448\n\n        hour10: -1.1995 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 9 becomes 10 -> so -1.200\n\n        hour11: -1.324 -> -1.324   (because -1.324 is the average? Actually, we computed -1.324? \n            But wait: -5.296/4 = -1.324 -> so exactly -1.324 -> so -1.324\n\n        hour12: -2.12325 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -2.123\n\n        hour13: -1.65225 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -1.652\n\n        hour14: -1.7235 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 3 becomes 4 -> -1.724\n\n        hour15: -1.670 -> -1.670\n\n        hour16: -2.02525 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -2.025\n\n        hour17: -2.41625 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -2.416\n\n        hour18: -2.20325 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -2.203\n\n        hour19: -2.41625 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -2.416\n\n        hour20: -2.41625 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 2 -> -2.416\n\n        hour21: -2.905 -> -2.905   (because -11.62/4 = -2.905 exactly)\n\n        hour22: -1.4035 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 3 becomes 4 -> -1.404\n\n        hour23: -1.2525 -> \n            The 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 2 becomes 3 -> -1.253\n\n    So the 24 averages (rounded) are:\n\n        hour0: -1.039\n        hour1: -0.640\n        hour2: -0.711\n        hour3: -0.568\n        hour4: -0.622\n        hour5: -0.782\n        hour6: -1.501\n        hour7: -0.924\n        hour8: -0.738\n        hour9: -1.448\n        hour10: -1.200\n        hour11: -1.324\n        hour12: -2.123\n        hour13: -1.652\n        hour14: -1.724\n        hour15: -1.670\n        hour16: -2.025\n        hour17: -2.416\n        hour18: -2.203\n        hour19: -2.416\n        hour20: -2.416\n        hour21: -2.905\n        hour22: -1.404\n        hour23: -1.253\n\n 9. Now, we generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-01-05 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-01-08 23:00:00\n\n        We have 4 days, so we repeat the above 24 values 4 times.\n\n 10. Write the output in the required format.\n\n 11. Note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are given complete data and we are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 12. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MULL'\n\n 13. Example of the first two days:\n\n        2017-01-05 00:00:00 -1.039\n        2017-01-05 01:00:00 -0.640\n        2017-01-05 02:00:00 -0.711\n        ... \n        2017-01-05 23:00:00 -1.253\n        2017-01-06 00:00:00 -1.039\n        2017-01-06 01:00:00 -0.640\n        ...\n        2017-01-08 23:00:00 -1.253\n\n 14. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n Let's code this in the answer.\n\n But note: we are to output in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [the data in the same format as input, with timestamp and value]\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n We'll write the data as:\n\n        date   MULL\n        2017-01-05 00:00:00 -1.039\n        ... \n\n However, the input had the index as the date and then a column named 'MULL'. But the output should be the same.\n\n But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n We are to output 96 lines.\n\n Let's generate the data.\n",
