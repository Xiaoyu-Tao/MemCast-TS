        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any missing values in the training data. Since the given data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series forecasting method. Given the data appears to have hourly seasonality (daily pattern of 24 hours) and some trend, we can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple moving average. However, with only 96 points (4 days) we have limited data.\n\n 3. Given the small data size, we can try to capture:\n    - Trend: The data might have a slight downward trend? But let's see: \n        The values on 2017-09-30: from 2.009 to 1.474 (last value of the day)\n        Then 2017-10-01: from 1.942 to 0.804\n        Then 2017-10-02: from 1.340 to 0.402\n        Then 2017-10-03: from 0.670 to 1.273 (last value)\n        It's not a clear trend.\n\n 4. We observe a daily pattern (24 hours). For example, on each day we see a peak and a trough.\n\n 5. We'll use a seasonal model. Since we have hourly data and daily seasonality (period=24), we can use SARIMA. However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA model with 24 seasonal lags might be challenging. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or a naive seasonal method.\n\n 6. Considering the constraints, we can use a seasonal naive method: \n    forecast for the next day (24 hours) by taking the last day's values? But note: the last day (2017-10-03) has values: \n        00:00: 0.670, 01:00:0.938, ... 23:00:1.273.\n\n    Then the next day (2017-10-04) would be the same as 2017-10-03? But we have 4 days of data and we see that the pattern is not exactly repeating.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. For example, the 00:00 value for 2017-10-04 would be the average of the 00:00 values of the previous 4 days.\n\n    Previous 4 days at 00:00:\n        2017-09-30: 2.009\n        2017-10-01: 1.942\n        2017-10-02: 1.340\n        2017-10-03: 0.670\n        Average = (2.009+1.942+1.340+0.670)/4 = 5.961/4 = 1.49025\n\n    Similarly for 01:00, etc.\n\n 8. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality. However, it does not capture trend. We see that the 00:00 values are decreasing? But then the last day (2017-10-03) is lower. We might adjust by a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the last day (2017-10-03) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous day? But that might be too noisy.\n\n10. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have very limited data, we'll use the average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n    Steps for the forecast:\n        For hour h in [0,23]:\n            Let v1 = value at hour h on day 1 (2017-09-30)\n            v2 = value at hour h on day 2 (2017-10-01)\n            v3 = value at hour h on day 3 (2017-10-02)\n            v4 = value at hour h on day 4 (2017-10-03)\n            Then forecast for hour h on day 5 (2017-10-04), day6 (2017-10-05), day7 (2017-10-06), day8 (2017-10-07) is the average: (v1+v2+v3+v4)/4.\n\n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So we will repeat the same 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n11. However, we note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n12. Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n    We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00):\n        days: [2.009, 1.942, 1.340, 0.670] -> average = (2.009+1.942+1.340+0.670)/4 = 1.49025\n\n    Similarly for hour 1 (01:00):\n        [2.076, 2.143, 1.541, 0.938] -> (2.076+2.143+1.541+0.938)/4 = 6.698/4 = 1.6745\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n13. Then the forecast for 2017-10-04 00:00:00 is 1.49025, 2017-10-04 01:00:00 is 1.6745, ... up to 2017-10-04 23:00:00 (which is the 23rd hour average).\n\n    Then for 2017-10-05, we use the same 24 averages again.\n\n14. We'll generate the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n15. We must format the dates: \n    - Start: 2017-10-04 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-10-03 23:00:00)\n    - Then 2017-10-04 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-07 23:00:00.\n\n16. We'll compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n17. But note: the data we have is exactly 4 days? \n        From 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00 -> 4 days * 24 = 96 points.\n\n18. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and accumulate the values for that hour from the 4 days.\n\n    We can index the data by hour of the day.\n\n    The data is in order, so:\n        hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n        hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73\n        ... \n        hour23: indices 23, 47, 71, 95\n\n19. We'll:\n    - Extract the 4 values for each hour from the 96 data points.\n    - Compute the average for that hour.\n\n20. Then we create the forecast for the next 4 days by repeating the 24 averages 4 times.\n\n21. Format the output: \n        <answer>\n        date                HULL\n        2017-10-04 00:00:00 [value0]\n        2017-10-04 01:00:00 [value1]\n        ...\n        2017-10-07 23:00:00 [value95]\n\n    The value0 is the average for hour0, value1 for hour1, ... value23 for hour23, then value24 (which is the first hour of the next day) is again the average for hour0, and so on.\n\n22. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n23. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We have the data as a string. We'll parse the data into a list of floats for the HULL values.\n\n    The HULL values in order (96 points):\n\n    [2.009, 2.076, 2.076, 1.674, 1.608, 1.407, 1.407, 1.206, 0.938, 0.067, 0.670, 0.603, 0.670, -0.268, -0.402, -1.608, -0.871, -0.804, -1.139, 0.536, 1.474, 1.942, 2.143, 2.143, 2.746, 1.674, 2.277, 0.737, 1.206, 1.541, 1.541, 2.679, 1.474, 4.488, 0.938, 0.603, 0.603, -0.268, 0.000, -0.804, -0.201, -0.201, 0.134, 0.670, 0.804, 1.340, 1.541, 1.407, 1.741, 1.541, 1.139, 1.072, 0.670, 1.139, 0.067, 0.335, 0.737, -0.335, -0.134, 0.134, 0.067, -0.469, 0.000, -0.536, -0.670, -0.938, -1.608, -0.536, 0.402, 0.670, 0.938, 0.402, 0.737, 0.201, 0.871, 0.402, 0.804, 0.938, 0.938, 0.737, 0.871, 0.402, 0.000, -0.067, 0.201, -0.067, -0.603, -1.139, -1.273, -1.273, -2.277, -0.067, 1.273]\n\n    Now, for hour in 0..23:\n\n    hour0: indices 0,24,48,72 -> [2.009, 1.942, 1.340, 0.670] -> avg = (2.009+1.942+1.340+0.670)/4 = 5.961/4 = 1.49025 -> 1.490\n    hour1: indices 1,25,49,73 -> [2.076, 2.143, 1.541, 0.938] -> (2.076+2.143+1.541+0.938)=6.698 -> 1.6745 -> 1.675\n    hour2: indices 2,26,50,74 -> [2.076, 2.143, 1.407, 0.402] -> (2.076+2.143+1.407+0.402)=6.028 -> 1.507\n    hour3: indices 3,27,51,75 -> [1.674, 2.746, 1.741, 0.737] -> (1.674+2.746+1.741+0.737)=6.898 -> 1.7245 -> 1.725\n    hour4: indices 4,28,52,76 -> [1.608, 1.674, 1.541, 0.201] -> (1.608+1.674+1.541+0.201)=5.024 -> 1.256\n    hour5: indices 5,29,53,77 -> [1.407, 2.277, 1.139, 0.871] -> (1.407+2.277+1.139+0.871)=5.694 -> 1.4235 -> 1.424\n    hour6: indices 6,30,54,78 -> [1.407, 0.737, 1.072, 0.402] -> (1.407+0.737+1.072+0.402)=3.618 -> 0.9045 -> 0.905\n    hour7: indices 7,31,55,79 -> [1.206, 1.206, 0.670, 0.804] -> (1.206+1.206+0.670+0.804)=3.886 -> 0.9715 -> 0.972\n    hour8: indices 8,32,56,80 -> [0.938, 1.541, 1.139, 0.938] -> (0.938+1.541+1.139+0.938)=4.556 -> 1.139\n    hour9: indices 9,33,57,81 -> [0.067, 1.541, 0.067, 0.737] -> (0.067+1.541+0.067+0.737)=2.412 -> 0.603\n    hour10: indices 10,34,58,82 -> [0.670, 2.679, 0.335, 0.871] -> (0.670+2.679+0.335+0.871)=4.555 -> 1.13875 -> 1.139\n    hour11: indices 11,35,59,83 -> [0.603, 1.474, -0.335, 0.402] -> (0.603+1.474-0.335+0.402)=2.144 -> 0.536\n    hour12: indices 12,36,60,84 -> [0.670, 4.488, -0.134, 0.000] -> (0.670+4.488-0.134+0.000)=5.024 -> 1.256\n    hour13: indices 13,37,61,85 -> [0.603, 0.938, 0.134, -0.067] -> (0.603+0.938+0.134-0.067)=1.608 -> 0.402\n    hour14: indices 14,38,62,86 -> [0.670, 0.603, 0.067, -0.603] -> (0.670+0.603+0.067-0.603)=0.737 -> 0.737\n    hour15: indices 15,39,63,87 -> [-0.268, 0.603, -0.469, -1.139] -> (-0.268+0.603-0.469-1.139)= -1.273 -> -0.31825 -> -0.318\n    hour16: indices 16,40,64,88 -> [-0.402, -0.268, 0.000, -1.273] -> (-0.402-0.268+0.000-1.273)= -1.943 -> -0.48575 -> -0.486\n    hour17: indices 17,41,65,89 -> [-1.608, 0.000, -0.536, -1.273] -> (-1.608+0.000-0.536-1.273)= -3.417 -> -0.85425 -> -0.854\n    hour18: indices 18,42,66,90 -> [-0.871, -0.804, -0.670, -2.277] -> (-0.871-0.804-0.670-2.277)= -4.622 -> -1.1555 -> -1.156\n    hour19: indices 19,43,67,91 -> [-0.804, -0.201, -0.938, -0.067] -> (-0.804-0.201-0.938-0.067)= -2.010 -> -0.5025 -> -0.503\n    hour20: indices 20,44,68,92 -> [-1.139, -0.201, -1.608, 1.273] -> (-1.139-0.201-1.608+1.273)= -1.675 -> -0.41875 -> -0.419\n    hour21: indices 21,45,69,93 -> [0.536, 0.134, -0.536, -0.067] -> (0.536+0.134-0.536-0.067)= 0.067 -> 0.01675 -> 0.017\n    hour22: indices 22,46,70,94 -> [1.474, 0.670, 0.402, 0.000] -> (1.474+0.670+0.402+0.000)=2.546 -> 0.6365 -> 0.637\n    hour23: indices 23,47,71,95 -> [1.273, 0.804, 0.402, 1.273] -> (1.273+0.804+0.402+1.273)=3.752 -> 0.938\n\n24.
