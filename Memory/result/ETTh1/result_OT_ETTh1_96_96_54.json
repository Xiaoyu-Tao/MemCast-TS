        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, for the given 96 points, we have complete data.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data is at hourly frequency, we can use:\n    - SARIMA: to capture both the daily seasonality (24 hours) and potential trends.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but given the small data (only 96 points for training) and the requirement for 96 forecasts, SARIMA might be more straightforward.\n\n 3. However, we have only 96 points (4 days) which is very limited for training a model with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24). We might face challenges in fitting a SARIMA model because of the short history.\n\n 4. Considering the limited data, we might use a simpler model. Let's check the data pattern:\n    - The data shows a daily pattern: temperatures drop during the night and rise during the day? But looking at the data, it's not very clear. For example, on 2017-02-02, the temperature starts at 9.075 at 00:00, then decreases until 08:00 (4.291), then increases until 19:00 (6.753) and then fluctuates.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only required to forecast 4 days (96 hours) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can try to use a naive seasonal approach: \n    - Forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day? But we have 4 days of data. We can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? However, 4 days is very short.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality, or the TBATS model which can handle multiple seasonality, but again, with only 96 points, the daily seasonality (24 points per season) and 4 seasons (days) might be too short.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we decide to use a simple moving average of the same hour over the available 4 days. For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour for the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Example:\n        For hour 00:00: \n            Day1: 9.075, Day2: 7.457, Day3: 11.396, Day4: 9.989 -> average = (9.075+7.457+11.396+9.989)/4 = 9.47925\n        Then for 2017-02-06 00:00:00, we forecast 9.479, and similarly for 2017-02-07 00:00:00, 2017-02-08 00:00:00, 2017-02-09 00:00:00 we use the same value? \n        But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n    However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n 8. Another approach: use the last available day (2017-02-05) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast with seasonality=24, and step=1 (using the last day as the forecast for the next days). \n\n    We can try: \n        Forecast for 2017-02-06 00:00:00 = value of 2017-02-05 00:00:00 (which is 9.989)\n        Forecast for 2017-02-06 01:00:00 = value of 2017-02-05 01:00:00 (10.622) and so on.\n\n    But note: the data on 2017-02-05 might be different from the previous days. However, without a clear trend and with only 4 days, this might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 9. We can also consider a combination: use the average of the last two days? But the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 points.\n\n10. After consideration, we choose the naive seasonal method with seasonality=24, using the last day (2017-02-05) as the pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n    Why?\n        - It's simple and commonly used for short-term forecasting in seasonal data.\n        - We have observed that the pattern repeats daily, even if the levels change. However, the levels do change: the first day (02-02) has a minimum of 3.869 and maximum of 9.075, the last day (02-05) has a minimum of 8.020 and maximum of 12.029. \n        - But without more data, we cannot adjust for the level change. So we assume the pattern of the last day will repeat.\n\n    Steps:\n        Let the last day (2017-02-05) be our base day: from 00:00 to 23:00.\n        Then the next 4 days (2017-02-06, 2017-02-07, 2017-02-08, 2017-02-09) will be the same as 2017-02-05, repeated.\n\n    However, note: the last day we have is 2017-02-05, so:\n        Day 1 of forecast: 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 23:00:00:00 -> same as 2017-02-05 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-02-07 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same as 2017-02-05 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-02-08 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same as 2017-02-05 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-02-09 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same as 2017-02-05 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n    But wait, the last day (2017-02-05) has 24 hours of data? Yes, from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n    Therefore, we will generate the next 96 hours by repeating the last 24 hours (2017-02-05) four times.\n\n11. However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values. But for the forecast period, we are to provide 96 points without missing values. So we are generating 96 points.\n\n12. Let's extract the last 24 hours (2017-02-05) from the given data:\n\n    2017-02-05 00:00:00  9.989\n    2017-02-05 01:00:00 10.622\n    2017-02-05 02:00:00 11.326\n    2017-02-05 03:00:00 11.467\n    2017-02-05 04:00:00 10.693\n    2017-02-05 05:00:00 11.185\n    2017-02-05 06:00:00 10.693\n    2017-02-05 07:00:00 10.622\n    2017-02-05 08:00:00 11.396\n    2017-02-05 09:00:00 10.200\n    2017-02-05 10:00:00  9.426\n    2017-02-05 11:00:00  9.075\n    2017-02-05 12:00:00  8.723\n    2017-02-05 13:00:00  9.778\n    2017-02-05 14:00:00 11.537\n    2017-02-05 15:00:00 12.029\n    2017-02-05 16:00:00 10.974\n    2017-02-05 17:00:00 10.904\n    2017-02-05 18:00:00 11.044\n    2017-02-05 19:00:00  9.919\n    2017-02-05 20:00:00 10.130\n    2017-02-05 21:00:00  9.778\n    2017-02-05 22:00:00  8.793\n    2017-02-05 23:00:00  8.020\n\n13. Now, we will create the next 96 hours:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same as above 24 values.\n    Day 2: 2017-02-07 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same 24 values again.\n    Day 3: 2017-02-08 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same 24 values again.\n    Day 4: 2017-02-09 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> same 24 values again.\n\n14. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n    The last date in the given data is 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n    The next date is 2017-02-06 00:00:00, then 2017-02-06 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n15. We write the forecast:\n\n    We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n    For i in range(0, 96):\n        date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i+1)  [but note: the last point is 2017-02-05 23:00:00, so the first forecast is 2017-02-06 00:00:00]\n\n    Actually, we can generate the dates by:\n        base_date = datetime(2017,2,6,0,0,0) then add hours.\n\n    But we can also note that the data is every hour.\n\n    We'll generate:\n        date = 2017-02-06 00:00:00, 2017-02-06 01:00:00, ... until 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n\n    And the OT values will be:\n        [9.989, 10.622, 11.326, 11.467, 8.020] for the first day, then repeat the same sequence for the next three days.\n\n16. However, note: the last day of the given data (2017-02-05) has 24 values. We are going to use these 24 values in order, and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n17. Let's code the sequence:\n\n    base_sequence = [9.989, 10.622, 11.326, 11.467, 10.693, 11.185, 10.693, 10.622, 11.396, 10.200, 9.426, 9.075, 8.723, 9.778, 11.537, 12.029, 10.974, 10.904, 11.044, 9.919, 10.130, 9.778, 8.793, 8.020]\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is: base_sequence * 4\n\n18. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not missing any in the provided 96, and for the forecast we are generating without missing values.\n\n19. We output the data in the required format.\n\n20.
