        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for LUFL (Low UseFul Load) from 2016-11-30 00:00:00 to 2016-12-03 23:00:00.\n We note that the data has a daily pattern and some seasonality. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 points. But we are to be cautious for the forecast.\n 2. We will use a time series model that can handle hourly data and multiple seasonality. However, with only 96 points, we have limited history.\n 3. Given the short history, we can consider using a model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA. But note the data has:\n    - A daily pattern (24 hours) and also a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture a weekly pattern.\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Decompose the series into trend and seasonality and then forecast by extending the seasonal component and adjusting with the trend.\n    - However, with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture.\n\n 5. Another idea: use the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days to form a daily profile, then adjust by the overall trend of the 4 days.\n\n 6. But note: the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. It seems to fluctuate daily.\n\n 7. We can use the following:\n    - Calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have. Then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 8. However, let's check the data: \n    - The first day (2016-11-30) is a Wednesday? We don't have the day of week, but we have 4 consecutive days: Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat? \n      Actually, 2016-11-30 is Wednesday, then Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n 9. The pattern might change on weekends? We have one Saturday (2016-12-03). We can see that Saturday's pattern is different? \n    Let's compare the same hour on different days.\n\n 10. But we only have one Saturday, so we cannot form a reliable weekend profile. Therefore, we might have to use the average of all days.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we will use the average of each hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n   - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 13. But note: the data might have a trend? We can check the overall average per day:\n        Day 1 (2016-11-30): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: average\n        Day 3: average\n        Day 4: average\n\n    Then we see if there is a trend? If there is, we can adjust the forecast by the trend.\n\n 14. Let's compute the daily averages:\n        Day1: 2016-11-30: \n            values: [3.838,4.021,3.929,3.929,3.807,3.96,4.508,5.148,2.589,2.376,2.559,2.985,2.193,2.163,2.041,2.345,2.711,3.686,3.229,2.802,2.528,2.071,1.553,1.645]\n            average = (sum of these)/24 = 2.899375\n\n        Day2: 2016-12-01: \n            [1.401,1.249,1.157,1.127,1.127,1.401,1.919,2.559,2.559,2.528,3.411,3.107,2.498,2.284,2.467,2.863,2.467,2.741,2.68,2.772,2.437,2.071,1.706,1.797]\n            average = 2.1991666666666665\n\n        Day3: 2016-12-02:\n            [4.021,3.868,3.777,3.716,3.807,4.264,4.66,5.3,2.559,2.924,3.015,3.929,3.046,2.68,2.041,2.132,2.68,2.955,3.503,3.198,2.711,2.619,1.919,1.767]\n            average = 3.125\n\n        Day4: 2016-12-03:\n            [1.523,1.614,1.553,1.31,1.401,1.736,2.193,2.68,1.949,1.858,1.675,2.224,1.828,2.01,2.345,2.071,2.284,2.924,2.924,2.772,2.772,2.193,1.675,1.919]\n            average = 2.080833333333333\n\n    The daily averages: [2.899, 2.199, 3.125, 2.081] -> no clear trend? It goes down then up then down.\n\n 15. Therefore, we will not adjust for trend and just use the hourly averages.\n\n 16. Compute the hourly average (over the 4 days) for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 17. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00) will be:\n        Day1: 2016-12-04: hour0, hour1, ... hour23 -> using the computed hourly averages\n        Day2: 2016-12-05: same hourly averages\n        Day3: 2016-12-06: same\n        Day4: 2016-12-07: same\n\n 18. But note: the starting point of the forecast is the next day after 2016-12-03, which is 2016-12-04 (Sunday).\n\n 19. We have one Saturday in the training (2016-12-03) and the next days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n     But we don't have any Sunday, Monday, etc. in the training. So we cannot do day-of-week adjustment.\n\n 20. Therefore, we stick to the simple hourly average.\n\n 21. How to compute the hourly average?\n        For hour0: (3.838 + 1.401 + 4.021 + 1.523) / 4 = (3.838+1.401+4.021+1.523)/4 = 10.783/4 = 2.69575\n        For hour1: (4.021+1.249+3.868+1.614)/4 = (4.021+1.249+3.868+1.614)/4 = 10.752/4 = 2.688\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 23. Then, we generate the next 96 hours (4 days) of data by repeating these 24 hourly averages for 4 days.\n\n 24. The dates will be from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n 25. Format: \n        date in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n        LUFL: rounded to 3 decimal places (as in the input)\n\n 26. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Step 1: Parse the given data and group by hour of day (0 to 23).\n\n  Step 2: For each hour, average the values.\n\n  Step 3: Generate the next 96 timestamps: \n        Start: 2016-12-04 00:00:00, then hourly until 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n  Step 4: For each timestamp, assign the average value for that hour (the hour in the day, 0 to 23).\n\n  Step 5: Format the output.\n\n 27. But note: the input data ends at 2016-12-03 23:00:00, so the next hour is 2016-12-04 00:00:00.\n\n 28. We'll generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 29. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [3.838, 1.401, 4.021, 1.523] -> (3.838+1.401+4.021+1.523)/4 = 10.783/4 = 2.69575 -> 2.696\n        hour1: [4.021, 1.249, 3.868, 1.614] -> (4.021+1.249+3.868+1.614)=10.752 -> 2.688\n        hour2: [3.929, 1.157, 3.777, 1.553] -> (3.929+1.157+3.777+1.553)=10.416 -> 2.604\n        hour3: [3.929, 1.127, 3.716, 1.310] -> (3.929+1.127+3.716+1.310)=10.082 -> 2.5205 -> 2.521\n        hour4: [3.807, 1.127, 3.807, 1.401] -> (3.807+1.127+3.807+1.401)=10.142 -> 2.5355 -> 2.536\n        hour5: [3.960, 1.401, 4.264, 1.736] -> (3.960+1.401+4.264+1.736)=11.361 -> 2.84025 -> 2.840\n        hour6: [4.508, 1.919, 4.660, 2.193] -> (4.508+1.919+4.660+2.193)=13.28 -> 3.320\n        hour7: [5.148, 2.559, 5.300, 2.680] -> (5.148+2.559+5.300+2.680)=15.687 -> 3.92175 -> 3.922\n        hour8: [2.589, 2.559, 2.559, 1.949] -> (2.589+2.559+2.559+1.949)=9.656 -> 2.414\n        hour9: [2.376, 2.528, 2.924, 1.858] -> (2.376+2.528+2.924+1.858)=9.686 -> 2.4215 -> 2.422\n        hour10: [2.559, 3.411, 3.015, 1.675] -> (2.559+3.411+3.015+1.675)=10.66 -> 2.665\n        hour11: [2.985, 3.107, 3.929, 2.224] -> (2.985+3.107+3.929+2.224)=12.245 -> 3.06125 -> 3.061\n        hour12: [2.193, 2.498, 3.046, 1.828] -> (2.193+2.498+3.046+1.828)=9.565 -> 2.39125 -> 2.391\n        hour13: [2.163, 2.284, 2.680, 2.010] -> (2.163+2.284+2.680+2.010)=9.137 -> 2.28425 -> 2.284\n        hour14: [2.041, 2.467, 2.041, 2.345] -> (2.041+2.467+2.041+2.345)=8.894 -> 2.2235 -> 2.224\n        hour15: [2.345, 2.863, 2.132, 2.071] -> (2.345+2.863+2.132+2.071)=9.411 -> 2.35275 -> 2.353\n        hour16: [2.711, 2.467, 2.680, 2.284] -> (2.711+2.467+2.680+2.284)=10.142 -> 2.5355 -> 2.536\n        hour17: [3.686, 2.741, 2.955, 2.924] -> (3.686+2.741+2.955+2.924)=12.306 -> 3.0765 -> 3.077\n        hour18: [3.229, 2.680, 3.503, 2.924] -> (3.229+2.680+3.503+2.924)=12.336 -> 3.084\n        hour19: [2.802, 2.772, 3.198, 2.772] -> (2.802+2.772+3.198+2.772)=11.544 -> 2.886\n        hour20: [2.528, 2.437, 2.711, 2.772] -> (2.528+2.437+2.711+2.772)=10.448 -> 2.612\n        hour21: [2.071, 2.071, 2.619, 2.193] -> (2.071+2.071+2.619+2.193)=8.954 -> 2.2385 -> 2.239\n        hour22: [1.553, 1.706, 1.919, 1.675] -> (1.553+1.706+1.919+1.675)=6.853 -> 1.71325 -> 1.713\n        hour23: [1.645, 1.797, 1.767, 1.919] -> (1.645+1.797+1.767+1.919)=7.128 -> 1.782\n\n 30. Now, we create the forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2016-12-04: hour0: 2.696, hour1: 2.688, ... hour23: 1.782\n        Day2: 2016-12-05: same as above\n        Day3: 2016-12-06: same\n        Day4: 2016-12-07: same\n\n 31. We must output the data in the same format.\n\n 32. We note that the dates are in the order: \n        2016-12-04 00:00:00\n        2016-12-04 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-12-04 23:00:00\n        2016-12-05 00:00:00\n        ... until 2016-12-07 23:00:00\n\n 33. We'll generate the timestamps and then assign the hourly average for the corresponding hour.\n\n 34. Let's code accordingly.\n\n 35. However, note: the original data has some variation and we are using a very simple method. But given the limited data, it is acceptable.\n\n 36. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 37. We must not omit any content, so we output 96 lines.\n\n Let's write the forecast data.\n",
