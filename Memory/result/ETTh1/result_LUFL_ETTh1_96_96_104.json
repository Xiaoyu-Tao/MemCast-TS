        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours in a day). Also, there might be weekly patterns but we only have 4 days, so we focus on daily.\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast should be robust to potential missingness in the future? \n    But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". \n    However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we assume the given 96 points are complete for the purpose of building the model.\n\n 3. We choose a model: Given the seasonality and the frequency (hourly), we can use a seasonal model. \n    Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days) and we have daily seasonality (period=24), we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or \n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or \n    - A simple seasonal naive model (but that might not capture trends) or \n    - Prophet by Facebook (if we had more data, but we only have 4 days).\n\n 4. Considering the limited data (only 4 days), we cannot use a model that requires long seasonal periods (like weekly). \n    We can try to use a model that uses daily seasonality (24 points) and we have 4 cycles.\n\n 5. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern: lower during the night, higher during the day, with peaks in the evening (around 20:00-21:00).\n    - There might be a slight increasing trend? But 4 days is too short to tell.\n\n 6. We decide to use a simple but effective model: Seasonal Naive. \n    Why? Because with only 4 days, complex models might overfit. The seasonal naive takes the value from the same time in the previous cycle (i.e., same hour of the previous day).\n\n    However, note that the last day (2017-08-24) is a Thursday. The next 4 days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? \n    But we don't have information about weekends? The given 4 days are from Monday (2017-08-21) to Thursday (2017-08-24). \n    The next 4 days would be Friday (2017-08-25) to Monday (2017-08-28). \n\n    Since we don't have weekend data, we cannot account for weekly seasonality. Therefore, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n    Or we can use the last day (Thursday) for Friday? But that might not be accurate because Friday might be different from Thursday.\n\n 7. Given the ambiguity and the lack of data, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note: the problem says the data has missing values. But in the given 96 points, we don't have any. So we are safe to average.\n\n    But wait: the next 4 days might have a different pattern? We don't know. \n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-24) as the pattern for the next day (2017-08-25) because it's the most recent. \n    Then for 2017-08-26, we can use the same pattern? But that would be a Saturday and we don't have Saturday data. \n\n    Since we don't have any data for weekends, we have to assume that the pattern for the next 4 days is similar to the last 4 days? \n\n 9. We decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days. This will smooth out any day-to-day variations and give a typical day.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        For hour 00:00:00: average of [2017-08-21 00:00:00, 2017-08-22 00:00:00, 2017-08-23 00:00:00, 2017-08-24 00:00:00]\n        Similarly for each hour (00 to 23).\n\n    Then, we will use this averaged daily pattern and repeat it for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 10. Why not use the last day? Because the problem says the data has missing values, but we don't have any in the given. \n     However, if we use the last day only, then we are ignoring the previous days. The average is more robust.\n\n 11. But note: the data shows a possible increasing pattern? Let's check the daily average:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-08-21): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: (2017-08-22): \n        Day 3: (2017-08-23):\n        Day 4: (2017-08-24):\n\n     We can compute the daily average to see if there's a trend.\n\n 12. However, we are only forecasting 4 days and we don't have a clear trend, so we can ignore the trend and just use the average.\n\n 13. Implementation:\n\n        We will group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n        Then, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 14. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-08-24 23:00:00. The next time point is 2017-08-25 00:00:00.\n\n 15. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-08-28 23:00:00\n\n        We can use pandas to generate the date range.\n\n 16. However, the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the given data we don't. \n     For the forecast, we are generating the full 96 points without missing.\n\n 17. Steps in code (if we were to code) but we have to write the output.\n\n        Step 1: Parse the given data (we have it as a string, but we can simulate grouping by hour).\n        Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), take the values at that hour for the 4 days and average.\n        Step 3: Create a list of 24 values (the average for each hour).\n        Step 4: Repeat this list 4 times to get 96 values.\n        Step 5: Generate the dates: from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00 (every hour).\n\n 18. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        Hour 0: (3.746 + 3.929 + 4.630 + 4.630) / 4? \n        Wait, the last day (2017-08-24) at 00:00:00 is 4.630? Actually, the data for 2017-08-24 00:00:00 is 4.630? \n        But the data:\n\n            2017-08-21 00:00:00 3.746\n            2017-08-22 00:00:00 3.929\n            2017-08-23 00:00:00 4.630\n            2017-08-24 00:00:00 4.630   -> Actually, the last day at 00:00:00 is 4.630? \n            But wait, the last day starts at 2017-08-24 00:00:00: 4.630? \n\n        Actually, the data for 2017-08-24 00:00:00 is 4.630? Let me check:\n\n            The last few lines:\n\n                2017-08-24 21:00:00 6.305\n                2017-08-24 22:00:00 5.818\n                2017-08-24 23:00:00 4.995\n\n            Then the next day (2017-08-25) would start at 00:00:00? But we don't have 2017-08-25.\n\n            The data for 2017-08-24 00:00:00 is actually the first entry of that day: 2017-08-24 00:00:00 4.630\n\n        So the four values for hour 00:00:00 are:\n\n            Day1: 3.746\n            Day2: 3.929\n            Day3: 4.630\n            Day4: 4.630\n\n        Average = (3.746 + 3.929 + 4.630 + 4.630) / 4 = (3.746+3.929=7.675; 4.630+4.630=9.26; total=16.935) -> 16.935/4 = 4.23375\n\n        Similarly for each hour.\n\n 19. But note: the data for the same hour might vary by day. We are taking the average to smooth.\n\n 20. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-25: [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... avg_hour23]\n        Day2: 2017-08-26: same pattern\n        Day3: 2017-08-27: same pattern\n        Day4: 2017-08-28: same pattern\n\n 22. We must generate the dates in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 23. We write the data in the same format as the input: two columns: 'date' and 'LUFL'\n\n 24. Since we are to provide the complete data, we output 96 rows.\n\n 25. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values. But we are generating the forecast without missing. \n     So we are providing a complete forecast.\n\n 26. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n        We note the data:\n\n            Hour 0: [3.746, 3.929, 4.630, 4.630] -> average = (3.746+3.929+4.630+4.630)/4 = 4.23375\n            Hour 1: [3.655, 3.807, 4.142, 4.142] -> wait, let me extract:\n\n            Actually, we have:\n\n                2017-08-21 00:00:00 -> hour0: 3.746\n                2017-08-21 01:00:00 -> hour1: 3.655\n                2017-08-22 00:00:00 -> hour0: 3.929\n                2017-08-22 01:00:00 -> hour1: 3.807\n\n                2017-08-23 00:00:00 -> hour0: 4.630\n                2017-08-23 01:00:00 -> hour1: 4.142\n\n                2017-08-24 00:00:00 -> hour0: 4.630\n                2017-08-24 01:00:00 -> hour1: 4.142   -> but wait, the data for 2017-08-24 01:00:00 is not given? \n\n            Actually, the data for 2017-08-24 starts at 00:00:00 and then 01:00:00 is missing? \n\n            Let me check the provided data:\n\n                The last day provided:\n\n                    2017-08-24 00:00:00 4.630\n                    2017-08-24 01:00:00 ??? -> the next line is 2017-08-24 02:00:00 3.838\n\n            Oh no! The data for 2017-08-24 01:00:00 is missing? \n\n            But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\". So we must handle that.\n\n 27. Correction: The provided data for 2017-08-24:\n\n        2017-08-24 00:00:00 4.630\n        2017-08-24 01:00:00 -> not provided? The next is 2017-08-24 02:00:00.\n\n        Actually, the data:\n\n            2017-08-24 00:00:00 4.630\n            2017-08-24 01:00:00 -> missing? \n            2017-08-24 02:00:00 3.838\n\n        So we have a missing value at 2017-08-24 01:00:00.\n\n 28. How to handle? We can impute the missing value. Since we are going to average, we can use the average of the previous and next? \n     or the same hour from the previous days? \n\n     We have:\n\n        Hour 1: \n            Day1: 3.655\n            Day2: 3.807\n            Day3: 4.142\n            Day4: missing\n\n        We can use the average of the other three? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use linear interpolation for the missing value in the last day? But we are only given 4 days.\n\n        We decide to use the average of the same hour from the previous three days for the missing hour in the last day.\n\n        So for 2017-08-24 01:00:00, we use: (3.655 + 3.807 + 4.142) / 3 = 3.868\n\n        Then we have for hour1: [3.655, 3.807, 4.142, 3.868] -> average = (3.655+3.807+4.142+3.868)/4 = 3.868\n\n        But note: we are imputing the missing value and then including it in the average.\n\n 29. Alternatively, we can compute the average for each hour using only the available days? \n     But then for hour1 we have 3 values, and for other hours we have 4? That would be inconsistent.\n\n 30. We decide to impute all missing values in the training data (the given 96 points) before computing the average.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        We first check the given 96 points for missing hours.\n\n        The data is hourly from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00 -> 4*24=96 points.\n\n        We have 96 rows? Let's count:\n\n            Day1: 24\n            Day2: 24\n            Day3: 24\n            Day4: 24? \n\n        But in the provided data, the last day (2017-08-24) has:\n\n            00:00:00 -> present\n            01:00:00 -> missing? \n            02:00:00 -> present\n            ... until 23:00:00.\n\n        So we have 23 points for day4? Then total 24+24+24+23 = 95 points?\n\n        But the problem says 96 recorded dates? \n\n        Actually, the data provided:\n\n            Starts: 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00 -> that should be 4*24=96.\n\n        But in the text, the last day ends at 23:00:00 and we have 24 entries? \n\n        However, the last day in the provided data:\n\n            2017-08-24 00:00:00\n            2017-08-24 02:00:00 -> wait, after 00:00:00, the next is 02:00:00? So we are missing 01:00:00.\n\n        Therefore, we have 95 rows? \n\n        But the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", so we should have 96. \n\n        Let me count the rows:\n\n            From 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-21 23:00:00 -> 24\n            Then 2017-08-22: 24 -> total 48\n            Then 2017-08-23: 24 -> total 72\n            Then 2017-08-24: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24? \n\n        But in the provided data, the last day has:\n\n            2017-08-24 00:00:00\n            2017-08-24 02:00:00   -> so we are missing 01:00:00 and then we have 02:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> that is 23 entries.\n\n        So total: 24+24+24+23 = 95.\n\n        Therefore, we are missing one point.\n\n 31. We must impute the missing point at 2017-08-24 01:00:00.\n\n     We can use linear interpolation for that day? \n\n        We have:\n            time0: 2017-08-24 00:00:00 -> 4.630\n            time2 : 2017-08-24 02:00:00 -> 3.838\n\n        Then at time1 (01:00:00): we can do: 4.630 + (3.838-4.630)/(2) * 1) = 4.630 - 0.396 = 4.234? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous days? \n\n        We decide to use the average of the same hour from the previous three days: (3.655, 3.807, 4.142) -> 3.868 as above.\n\n        We'll use 3.868.\n\n 32. So we add a row for 2017-08-24 01:00:00 with value 3.868.\n\n 33. Now we have 96 points.\n\n 34. Then we group by hour and average.\n\n 35. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n 36. Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 37. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-25 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-25 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-26 00:00:00 ... until 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n 38. We output the data in the same format.\n\n 39. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 40. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) after imputing the missing value.\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the average.\n\n     We'll write a table:\n\n        Hour0: [3.746, 3.929, 4.630, 4.630] -> (3.746+3.929+4.630+4.630)/4 = 4.23375\n        Hour1: [3.655, 3.807, 4.142, 3.868] -> (3.655+3.807+4.142+3.868)/4 = 3.472? \n            Let me calculate: 3.655+3.807=7.462; 4.142+3.868=8.01; total=15.472 -> 15.472/4=3.868\n\n        Hour2: [3.716, 3.472, 3.838, 3.838] -> \n            Day1: 3.716\n            Day2: 3.472\n            Day3: 3.838 (from 2017-08-23 02:00:00: 3.838?
