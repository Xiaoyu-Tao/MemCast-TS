        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (from 2017-03-30 00:00:00 to 2017-04-02 23:00:00) of oil temperature (OT) for a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, we don't see any explicit missing values (like NaN). \n    However, the problem states to be aware of missing values. Since the provided data does not have missing values in the given segment, \n    we assume the provided 96 points are complete. But we must handle any potential missing values in the forecasting process appropriately.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we will generate 96 future timestamps.\n\n 3. We must choose a model. Since we are in a constrained environment without the ability to run complex model training, \n    we will use a simple but effective method: Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA. However, note that the data shows:\n      - A daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly is not visible.\n      - The data from 2017-03-31 is constant (6.753) for the entire day, which might be an anomaly or missing data? \n        But the problem says there are missing values, so we must be cautious.\n\n 4. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the presence of a constant day (which might be an issue), we can consider:\n      - Using a model that can handle seasonality. Since we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) and we want to forecast 4 days, \n        we can use a seasonal model with period=24.\n\n 5. However, the constant day (2017-03-31) might distort the seasonality. We might need to treat it as missing? \n    But the problem says the data has missing values and we are to be aware of that. However, the provided data does not have NaNs. \n    We are not instructed to impute the past, but to forecast the future.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    We will use the Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) because it can capture level, trend, and seasonality.\n\n    But note: the data has:\n        - March 30: varying, with a dip in the day and then a constant at night? \n        - March 31: constant all day (which is unusual) -> this might be an anomaly or an error? \n        - April 1 and 2: more typical with a daily pattern (higher during the day, lower at night) but note that April 2 has a significant increase.\n\n    Given the anomaly on March 31, we might consider it as an outlier and try to adjust? But without more context, we proceed with caution.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a model that is robust to such anomalies? Or we can use an ARIMA model with seasonality.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we choose to use a simple average of the last two days (April 1 and 2) to forecast the next days? \n    But that would ignore the trend and the level of the last day is higher than the previous.\n\n    Another idea: use the last two days (April 1 and 2) to compute a daily profile and then adjust by the level of the last day? \n    But we are forecasting 4 days, and we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will use a model that can automatically capture the patterns.\n\n    We'll use the `statsmodels` library for Exponential Smoothing (if available) or SARIMA. However, since we are in a text-based environment, \n    we cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a simple method.\n\n 9. We decide to use a naive seasonal method: \n        forecast = average of the same hour in the previous two days (April 1 and 2) \n        but adjusted by the overall level change.\n\n    However, note that the data on March 30 is also available, but March 31 is constant and not useful.\n\n    Steps for the method:\n        Let D1 = April 1 (24 hours: index 24 to 47 in the 96 points)\n        Let D2 = April 2 (24 hours: index 48 to 71 in the 96 points)\n\n        We are missing the last 24 hours? Actually, the data ends at 2017-04-02 23:00:00, which is the 96th point.\n\n        We have 96 points: \n            [0:24] -> March 30\n            [24:48] -> March 31 (constant, so we skip)\n            [48:72] -> April 1\n            [72:96] -> April 2\n\n        So we use April 1 and April 2 to form the daily profiles.\n\n        For each hour h (0 to 23):\n            base_h = (D1[h] + D2[h]) / 2   [if we use average]\n\n        But note: there is an increasing trend? The temperatures on April 2 are generally higher than April 1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? Or we can project the trend.\n\n        We can compute the trend factor: \n            total_avg_D1 = average of D1\n            total_avg_D2 = average of D2\n            trend_factor = (total_avg_D2 - total_avg_D1)   [per day]\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (day1: April 3, day2: April 4, day3: April 5, day4: April 6), we can set:\n\n        For day i (i=1,2,3,4) and hour h:\n            forecast = base_h + i * (trend_factor)   [but this might be too aggressive?]\n\n        However, we only have two days, so the trend might not be linear. Also, the constant day in between breaks the pattern.\n\n 10. Given the challenges, we decide to use a simple average of the last two days (April 1 and 2) for each hour, \n     and then add a small trend component for the next days? But without more data, we cannot be sure.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the trend from the entire dataset? The entire dataset is only 4 days, and the first day (March 30) is lower, \n     then a constant day, then two increasing. \n\n     We can compute the overall trend by linear regression? But that might be overkill.\n\n 11. We decide to use the following:\n\n     Let the base profile be the last two days (April 1 and 2). For each hour h (0-23), we compute:\n        base_h = (D1[h] + D2[h]) / 2\n\n     Then, for the next 4 days? Actually, we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). We will repeat the base profile for the next 4 days? \n     But note: the problem says \"next 96 recorded dates\", which is 4 days? Actually, 96 hours is 4 days.\n\n     However, we see that the two days we have (April 1 and 2) are consecutive and show an increase. \n     We can compute the daily average for April 1 and April 2:\n\n        April 1: average = (10.693+11.467+...+12.592)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            We can see the values are around 10-15, average about 12.5? \n        April 2: average = (13.085+13.014+...+14.069)/24 -> roughly 15? \n\n        The difference is about 2.5 per day? That would be a very strong trend and likely not sustainable for 4 more days.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the average of the two days and then project the trend for the next days by adding half the daily difference per day? \n\n     But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so:\n\n        Day1 (April 3): base_h + (trend_per_day) * 1\n        Day2 (April 4): base_h + (trend_per_day) * 2\n        Day3: base_h + (trend_per_day) * 3\n        Day4: base_h + (trend_per_day) * 4\n\n     However, the trend might not be linear and we only have two points. We might cap the trend? \n\n 12. Considering the risk of over-extrapolation, we might assume the trend flattens. \n\n     We can do:\n\n        Let T1 = average of April 1\n        Let T2 = average of April 2\n        trend_per_day = (T2 - T1)\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we assume the daily average increases by (trend_per_day) for the first day, then by half of that for the next, and then flattens? \n\n     But without domain knowledge, we keep it simple: we use the average of the two days and then add a linear trend for the next 4 days? \n\n     However, we note that the temperature cannot keep increasing indefinitely. \n\n 13. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide an answer, we decide to use:\n\n        For each hour h (0-23) in the day:\n\n        Let base_h = (D1[h] + D2[h]) / 2   [this is the average for that hour]\n\n        Then, we compute the daily average for April 1 and April 2:\n\n            T1 = average of D1 (April 1)\n            T2 = average of D2 (April 2)\n\n        Then the daily average for the next days:\n\n            T3 = T2 + (T2 - T1)   [for April 3]\n            T4 = T3 + (T2 - T1)   [for April 4]\n            T5 = T4 + (T2 - T1)   [for April 5]\n            T6 = T5 + (T2 - T1)   [for April 6]\n\n        But we are only forecasting 4 days (April 3,4,5,6) so we need T3, T4, T5, T6.\n\n        Then, for a given day i (i=3,4,5,6) and hour h:\n\n            forecast = base_h + (T_i - (T1+T2)/2)\n\n        This adjusts the base_h by the difference between the projected daily average and the average of the two base days.\n\n 14. But note: the base_h already is the average of the two days. The average of the base_h over 24 hours is (T1+T2)/2.\n\n        So we want to shift the entire daily profile for day i by: (T_i - (T1+T2)/2)\n\n        However, this might not capture the intra-day variations appropriately.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can scale the entire day by a factor? \n\n        For day i, we can do: \n            forecast = base_h * (T_i) / ((T1+T2)/2)\n\n        But that would change the shape. We don't know if the change is additive or multiplicative.\n\n 16. Given the short history, we choose additive.\n\n 17. Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Compute T1 and T2 (the daily averages for April 1 and April 2).\n\n        Step 2: Compute the base profile for each hour: base_h = (D1[h] + D2[h]) / 2, for h in 0..23.\n\n        Step 3: Compute the overall base average: T_base = (T1+T2)/2.\n\n        Step 4: For each day i in [3,4,5,6]:\n                    T_i = T2 + (i-2) * (T2 - T1)   [so for April 3: i=3 -> T3 = T2 + (3-2)*(T2-T1) = T2 + (T2-T1) = 2*T2 - T1]\n                    Then for each hour h in 0..23:\n                         value = base_h + (T_i - T_base)\n\n        Step 5: Generate the timestamps: starting from 2017-04-03 00:00:00, then hourly for 96 hours.\n\n 18. But note: the data on March 31 is constant and we skipped it. We are only using April 1 and 2.\n\n 19. Let's compute T1 and T2:\n\n        April 1 (D1: indices 48 to 71? Actually, the data:\n\n            The first 24: March 30 (0-23)\n            next 24: March 31 (24-47) -> skip\n            next 24: April 1 (48-71)\n            next 24: April 2 (72-95) [because 96 points: 0 to 95]\n\n        So:\n            D1: 2017-04-01 00:00:00 to 2017-04-01 23:00:00 -> indices 48 to 71 (24 points)\n            D2: 2017-04-02 00:00:00 to 2017-04-02 23:00:00 -> indices 72 to 95 (24 points)\n\n        T1 = average of the 24 values on April 1.\n        T2 = average of the 24 values on April 2.\n\n        We calculate:\n\n            T1 = (10.693+11.467+11.889+11.326+11.818+11.185+9.145+9.215+9.638+10.763+12.381+12.100+12.311+12.170+12.874+13.366+14.632+14.703+14.843+13.507+13.788+13.718+12.733+12.592) / 24\n\n            Let's compute step by step:\n\n                We can sum the values for April 1:\n\n                10.693, 11.467, 11.889, 11.326, 11.818, 11.185, 9.145, 9.215, 9.638, 10.763, 12.381, 12.100, \n                12.311, 12.170, 12.874, 13.366, 14.632, 14.703, 14.843, 13.507, 13.788, 13.718, 12.733, 12.592\n\n                Sum = 10.693+11.467 = 22.16\n                +11.889 = 34.049\n                +11.326 = 45.375\n                +11.818 = 57.193\n                +11.185 = 68.378\n                +9.145 = 77.523\n                +9.215 = 86.738\n                +9.638 = 96.376\n                +10.763 = 107.139\n                +12.381 = 119.52\n                +12.100 = 131.62\n                +12.311 = 143.931\n                +12.170 = 156.101\n                +12.874 = 168.975\n                +13.366 = 182.341\n                +14.632 = 196.973\n                +14.703 = 211.676\n                +14.843 = 226.519\n                +13.507 = 240.026\n                +13.788 = 253.814\n                +13.718 = 267.532\n                +12.733 = 280.265\n                +12.592 = 292.857\n\n                T1 = 292.857 / 24 = 12.202375\n\n            T2: April 2 (indices 72 to 95)\n\n                13.085, 13.014, 13.085, 12.029, 12.944, 12.592, 12.170, 13.014, 13.999, 11.818, 13.647, 13.436, \n                14.140, 14.914, 17.094, 18.783, 19.486, 20.330, 18.220, 17.305, 16.743, 14.843, 14.562, 14.069\n\n                Sum = 13.085+13.014 = 26.099\n                +13.085 = 39.184\n                +12.029 = 51.213\n                +12.944 = 64.157\n                +12.592 = 76.749\n                +12.170 = 88.919\n                +13.014 = 101.933\n                +13.999 = 115.932\n                +11.818 = 127.75\n                +13.647 = 141.397\n                +13.436 = 154.833\n                +14.140 = 168.973\n                +14.914 = 183.887\n                +17.094 = 200.981\n                +18.783 = 219.764\n                +19.486 = 239.25\n                +20.330 = 259.58\n                +18.220 = 277.8\n                +17.305 = 295.105\n                +16.743 = 311.848\n                +14.843 = 326.691\n                +14.562 = 341.253\n                +14.069 = 355.322\n\n                T2 = 355.322 / 24 = 14.805083333333333\n\n        Then:\n            trend_per_day = T2 - T1 = 14.805083333333333 - 12.202375 = 2.602708333333333\n\n        T_base = (T1+T2)/2 = (12.202375 + 14.805083333333333)/2 = 13.503729166666666\n\n        Now, for the next 4 days:\n\n            Day 3 (April 3): T3 = T2 + 1 * trend_per_day = 14.805083333333333 + 2.602708333333333 = 17.407791666666666\n            Day 4 (April 4): T4 = T2 + 2 * trend_per_day = 14.805083333333333 + 2*2.602708333333333 = 20.0105\n            Day 5 (April 5): T5 = T2 + 3 * trend_per_day = 14.805083333333333 + 3*2.602708333333333 = 22.61320833333333\n            Day 6 (April 6): T6 = T2 + 4 * trend_per_day = 14.805083333333333 + 4*2.602708333333333 = 25.215916666666665\n\n        But note: these daily averages are increasing very fast. The temperature on April 2 was already high (max 20.33) and we are projecting an average of 25.2 for April 6? \n        That might be too high. However, we are following the trend of the last two days.\n\n        Alternatively, we might cap the trend? But the problem does not give us domain constraints.\n\n        We'll proceed as per the method.\n\n 20. Now, we compute the base_h for each hour (0-23) by averaging the corresponding hour of April 1 and April 2.\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): \n            April 1: 10.693, April 2: 13.085 -> base_0 = (10.693+13.085)/2 = 11.889\n        For hour 1 (01:00):\n            April 1: 11.467, April 2: 13.014 -> base_1 = (11.467+13.014)/2 = 12.2405\n        ... and so on.\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then, for each day i (3,4,5,6) and hour h (0-23):\n\n        value = base_h + (T_i - T_base)\n\n        For example, for April 3 (day3) at 00:00: \n            value = 11.889 + (17.407791666666666 - 13.503729166666666) \n                   = 11.889 + 3.9040625 = 15.7930625\n\n        For April 3 at 01:00:\n            value = 12.2405 + 3.9040625 = 16.1445625\n\n        And similarly for the rest.\n\n 22. We generate 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n 23. However, note that the method might produce values that are not realistic? For example, the temperature might be too high. \n     But we are following the data trend.\n\n 24. We must also note that the data on March 30 and 31 are not used. This is because March 31 is constant and March 30 is before the constant day and might be a different pattern.\n\n 25. We'll compute the base_h for all 24 hours:\n\n        Hour 0: (10.693 + 13.085)/2 = 11.889\n        Hour 1: (11.467 + 13.014)/2 = 12.2405\n        Hour 2: (11.889 + 13.085)/2 = 12.487\n        [Note: April 1, hour2: 11.889; April 2, hour2: 13.085? Actually, the data for April 2 hour2 is 13.085? \n         But the data for April 2: \n            00:00: 13.085\n            01:00: 13.014\n            02:00: 13.085   -> so yes, hour2 is 13.085.\n\n        Hour 3: (11.326 + 12.029)/2 = 11.6775\n        Hour 4: (11.818 + 12.944)/2 = 12.381\n        Hour 5: (11.185 + 12.592)/2 = 11.8885\n        Hour 6: (9.145 + 12.170)/2 = 10.6575\n        Hour 7: (9.215 + 13.014)/2 = 11.1145\n        Hour 8: (9.638 + 13.999)/2 = 11.8185\n        Hour 9: (10.763 + 11.818)/2 = 11.2905\n        Hour 10: (12.381 + 13.647)/2 = 13.014\n        Hour 11: (12.100 + 13.436)/2 = 12.768\n        Hour 12: (12.311 + 14.140)/2 = 13.2255\n        Hour 13: (12.170 + 14.914)/2 = 13.542\n        Hour 14: (12.874 + 17.094)/2 = 14.984\n        Hour 15: (13.366 + 18.783)/2 = 16.0745\n        Hour 16: (14.632 + 19.486)/2 = 17.059\n        Hour 17: (14.703 + 20.330)/2 = 17.5165\n        Hour 18: (14.843 + 18.220)/2 = 16.5315\n        Hour 19: (13.507 + 17.305)/2 = 15.406\n        Hour 20: (13.788 + 16.743)/2 = 15.2655\n        Hour 21: (13.718 + 14.843)/2 = 14.2805\n        Hour 22: (12.733 + 14.562)/2 = 13.6475\n        Hour 23: (12.592 + 14.069)/2 = 13.3305\n\n 26. Now, we compute the adjustment for each day:\n\n        Day3 (April 3): adjustment = T3 - T_base = 17.407791666666666 - 13.503729166666666 = 3.9040625\n        Day4 (April 4): adjustment = T4 - T_base = 20.0105 - 13.503729166666666 = 6.506770833333334\n        Day5 (April 5): adjustment = T5 - T_base = 22.61320833333333 - 13.503729166666666 = 9.109479166666664\n        Day6 (April 6): adjustment = T6 - T_base = 25.215916666666665 - 13.503729166666666 = 11.7121875\n\n 27. Then, for each day and hour:\n\n        April 3: \n            hour0: 11.889 + 3.9040625 = 15.7930625\n            hour1: 12.2405 + 3.9040625 = 16.1445625\n            hour2: 12.487 + 3.9040625 = 16.3910625\n            hour3: 11.6775 + 3.9040625 = 15.5815625\n            hour4: 12.381 + 3.9040625 = 16.2850625\n            hour5: 11.8885 + 3.9040625 = 15.7925625\n            hour6: 10.6575 + 3.9040625 = 14.5615625\n            hour7: 11.1145 + 3.9040625 = 15.0185625\n            hour8: 11.8185 + 3.9040625 = 15.7225625\n            hour9: 11.2905 + 3.9040625 = 15.1945625\n            hour10: 13.014 + 3.9040625 = 16.9180625\n            hour11: 12.768 + 3.9040625 = 16.6720625\n            hour12: 13.2255 + 3.9040625 = 17.1295625\n            hour13: 13.542 + 3.9040625 = 17.4460625\n            hour14: 14.984 + 3.9040625 = 18.8880625\n            hour15: 16.0745 + 3.9040625 = 19.9785625\n            hour16: 17.059 + 3.9040625 = 20.9630625\n            hour17: 17.5165 + 3.9040625 = 21.4205625\n            hour18: 16.5315 + 3.9040625 = 20.4355625\n            hour19: 15.406 + 3.9040625 = 19.3100625\n            hour20: 15.2655 + 3.9040625 = 19.1695625\n            hour21: 14.2805 + 3.9040625 = 18.1845625\n            hour22: 13.6475 + 3.9040625 = 17.5515625\n            hour23: 13.3305 + 3.9040625 = 17.2345625\n\n        Similarly for the next days, we add the corresponding adjustment.\n\n 28. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-04-03 00:00:00, then 2017-04-03 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-06 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 30. However, note: the method produces increasing temperatures and the values for April 6 might be very high (over 25 average). \n     But we are following the instructions and the trend.\n\n 31. We output the data in the same structure as the input: two columns (date and OT), with OT rounded to 6 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 32. We'll generate the next 96 points.\n\n 33. Code for generation (conceptually):\n\n        base_h = [11.889, 12.2405, 12.487, 11.6775, 12.381, 11.8885, 10.6575, 11.1145, 11.8185, 11.2905, 13.014, 12.768, 13.2255, 13.542, 14.984, 16.0745, 17.059, 17.5165, 16.5315, 15.406, 15.2655, 14.2805, 13.6475, 13.3305]\n        adjustments = [3.9040625, 6.506770833333334, 9.109479166666664, 11.7121875]\n\n        dates = []\n        values = []\n        start_date = datetime(2017,4,3,0,0,0)\n        for day_idx in range(4):\n            adjustment = adjustments[day_idx]\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day_idx, hours=hour)\n                value = base_h[hour] + adjustment\n                dates.append(date)\n                values.append(value)\n\n 34. Format the dates as string: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 35. We write the data in the answer block.\n\n 36. But note: the input data has 6 decimal places? Actually, it has 3. But we computed with more precision. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. However, the input: \n        10.341000 -> 3 decimal places? Actually, it has 3 decimal places but stored as 6. We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n        So we round the OT to 3 decimal places.\n\n 38. Let's do the first few for April 3:\n\n        hour0: 15.7930625 -> 15.793\n        hour1: 16.1445625 -> 16.145 (rounded to 3 decimals: we round half up)\n\n        We'll round each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. We generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 40. Due to the length, we will write a program to generate the values and then format them. But since we are in text, we do it manually for the first few and then use a pattern? \n\n However, we are to provide the complete data. We'll compute all 96.\n\n 41. We decide to write a table for the answer.\n\n 42. We note: the adjustments for the days:\n\n        Day0 (April3): 3.9040625 -> adjustment = 3.904\n        Day1 (April4): 6.506770833333334 -> 6.507\n        Day2 (April5): 9.109479166666664 -> 9.109\n        Day3 (April6): 11.7121875 -> 11.712\n\n        But we are adding to base_h which has 4 decimal places? Then we round the final value to 3.\n\n 43. We'll compute each value and round.\n\n 44. We generate the dates:\n\n        April 3: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        April 4: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        April 5: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        April 6: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 45. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 46. Due to the large amount of data, we will only show the first few and last few in the thinking, but in the answer we must provide all.\n\n 47. We'll generate the entire 96 rows.\n\n 48. Let's do the first day (April 3) as an example:\n\n        base_h[0] = 11.889 -> 11.889 + 3.9040625 = 15.7930625 -> 15.793\n        base_h[1] = 12.2405 -> 12.2405+3.9040625 = 16.1445625 -> 16.145\n        base_h[2] = 12.487+3.9040625 = 16.3910625 -> 16.391\n        base_h[3] = 11.6775+3.9040625 = 15.5815625 -> 15.582\n        base_h[4] = 12.381+3.9040625 = 16.2850625 -> 16.285\n        base_h[5] = 11.8885+3.9040625 = 15.7925625 -> 15.793\n        base_h[6] = 10.6575+3.9040625 = 14.5615625 -> 14.562\n        base_h[7] = 11.1145+3.9040625 = 15.0185625 -> 15.019\n        base_h[8] = 11.8185+3.9040625 = 15.7225625 -> 15.723\n        base_h[9] = 11.2905+3.9040625 = 15.1945625 -> 15.195\n        base_h[10] = 13.014+3.9040625 = 16.9180625 -> 16.918\n        base_h[11] = 12.768+3.9040625 = 16.6720625 -> 16.672\n        base_h[12] = 13.2255+3.9040625 = 17.1295625 -> 17.130\n        base_h[13] = 13.542+3.9040625 = 17.4460625 -> 17.446\n        base_h[14] = 14.984+3.9040625 = 18.8880625 -> 18.888\n        base_h[15] = 16.0745+3.9040625 = 19.9785625 -> 19.979\n        base_h[16] = 17.059+3.9040625 = 20.9630625 -> 20.963\n        base_h[17] = 17.5165+3.9040625 = 21.4205625 -> 21.421\n        base_h[18] = 16.5315+3.9040625 = 20.4355625 -> 20.436\n        base_h[19] = 15.406+3.9040625 = 19.3100625 -> 19.310\n        base_h[20] = 15.2655+3.9040625 = 19.1695625 -> 19.170\n        base_h[21] = 14.2805+3.9040625 = 18.1845625 -> 18.185\n        base_h[22] = 13.6475+3.9040625 = 17.5515625 -> 17.552\n        base_h[23] = 13.3305+3.9040625 = 17.2345625 -> 17.235\n\n 49. Similarly for the next days, we add the corresponding adjustment (6.507, 9.109, 11.712) to the same base_h.\n\n 50. We write the answer in the format.\n\n 51. Note: The rounding is to 3 decimal places (round half to even? but the input uses 3 decimal places, so we use round to 3 decimals).\n\n 52. We'll generate the entire 96 rows.\n\n 53. Due to the length, we do it programmatically in our mind and write the answer.\n\n 54. We provide the answer in the required format.\n",
