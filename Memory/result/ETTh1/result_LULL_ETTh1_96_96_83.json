        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-29 00:00:00 to 2017-06-01 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-06-02 00:00:00 to 2017-06-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, the provided data for the past 96 points is complete. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle) and possibly weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly patterns might not be captured. We can use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 steps ahead, we can use a model that is suitable for time series with seasonality. Since the data is hourly and we have 24 points per day, the seasonality period is 24.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality. However, note that the data has a step change on 2017-05-31 (all values become 1.097 for a whole day) and then changes again on 2017-06-01. This might be an anomaly or a change in the operating condition.\n\n 5. Considering the short history and the anomaly, a naive approach might not be sufficient. We can try to use a model that is robust to such changes. However, without more context, we have to rely on the available data.\n\n 6. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 7. Approach:\n    - We can use a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by taking the same hour of the previous day. But the last day (2017-06-01) is different from the previous days. \n    - Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available days? But note that 2017-05-31 is an anomaly (constant 1.097). So we might exclude that day? Or use the most recent day (2017-06-01) as the pattern for the last day (2017-06-01) has a pattern that is more similar to the first two days (2017-05-29 and 2017-05-30) than the constant day (2017-05-31). \n\n 8. Since we have only one normal day after the constant day, we can use the pattern of 2017-06-01 for the next day? But that would be a naive forecast of one day ahead and then repeat? \n\n 9. However, we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). We can do:\n    - Day 1 (2017-06-02): use the pattern of 2017-06-01 (the day immediately before) but adjusted? \n    - But note: the data on 2017-06-01 ends with 0.640 at 23:00, which is a drop. We don't know if that is an outlier or a real pattern.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the short data, we can use a simple exponential smoothing model with seasonality (Holt-Winters) for hourly data with seasonality=24. But the model might not capture the anomaly well.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use an average of the non-anomalous days (2017-05-29, 2017-05-30, and 2017-06-01) for the same hour. But note that 2017-05-31 is anomalous (constant) so we skip it.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        - For each hour (0 to 23) of the day, we have:\n            Day1: 2017-05-29\n            Day2: 2017-05-30\n            Day3: 2017-06-01   [skip 2017-05-31 because it is constant and might be a special day?]\n\n        - Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-06-02 to 2017-06-05) will be the average of these three days for each hour.\n\n    But note: the last value of 2017-06-01 at 23:00 is 0.640, which is lower than the previous days. So if we average, we include that.\n\n 12. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.249 + 1.492 + 1.127) / 3 = (1.249+1.492+1.127)/3 = 3.868/3 = 1.289333\n        hour1: (0.883 + 1.432 + 0.944) / 3 = (0.883+1.432+0.944)/3 = 3.259/3 = 1.086333\n        ... and so on.\n\n    Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n 13. However, the data on 2017-06-01 might be the most recent and most representative? But we are averaging with two other days. Alternatively, we can use only 2017-06-01 and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would ignore the previous days.\n\n 14. Considering the instruction and the fact that we don't have a clear trend, and the data is short, I will use the average of the three non-constant days (2017-05-29, 2017-05-30, 2017-06-01) for each hour and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 15. But note: the last day (2017-06-01) has a value 0.640 at 23:00, which is an outlier? Let's check the previous days at 23:00:\n        2017-05-29 23:00:00 -> 1.127\n        2017-05-30 23:00:00 -> 1.218\n        2017-06-01 23:00:00 -> 0.640\n\n    The average for hour23: (1.127 + 1.218 + 0.640)/3 = 2.985/3 = 0.995\n\n 16. We'll create a template of 24 hours (from hour0 to hour23) by averaging the three days (excluding the constant day). Then we repeat this template 4 times (for 4 days).\n\n 17. Steps to compute:\n\n    Let's extract the data:\n\n        Day0: 2017-05-29 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day1: 2017-05-30 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day2: 2017-05-31 (constant, skip)\n        Day3: 2017-06-01 (index 72 to 95)   [Note: 96 points: 0-23, 24-47, 48-71 (constant), 72-95]\n\n    So for each hour in the day (0 to 23) we take:\n        hour0: index0, index24, index72\n        hour1: index1, index25, index73\n        ... \n\n 18. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 19. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day4 (2017-06-02): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... avg_hour23]\n        Day5 (2017-06-03): same as above\n        Day6 (2017-06-04): same\n        Day7 (2017-06-05): same\n\n 20. But note: the dates must be generated as:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-02 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-06-01 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-06-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-05 23:00:00.\n\n 21. We'll generate the dates and the forecasted values.\n\n 22. However, note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days and one of them constant, it's hard to capture. So we go with the average.\n\n 23. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: (1.249 + 1.492 + 1.127) / 3 = 3.868 / 3 = 1.289333\n        hour1: (0.883 + 1.432 + 0.944) / 3 = 3.259 / 3 = 1.086333\n        hour2: (1.005 + 1.675 + 0.975) / 3 = 3.655 / 3 = 1.218333\n        hour3: (0.975 + 1.675 + 0.944) / 3 = 3.594 / 3 = 1.198000\n        hour4: (1.188 + 1.218 + 0.914) / 3 = 3.32 / 3 = 1.106667\n        hour5: (1.157 + 0.822 + 0.975) / 3 = 2.954 / 3 = 0.984667\n        hour6: (1.462 + 1.036 + 1.218) / 3 = 3.716 / 3 = 1.238667\n        hour7: (1.523 + 1.127 + 1.432) / 3 = 4.082 / 3 = 1.360667\n        hour8: (1.371 + 1.401 + 1.097) / 3 = 3.869 / 3 = 1.289667\n        hour9: (1.310 + 1.249 + 0.944) / 3 = 3.503 / 3 = 1.167667\n        hour10: (1.218 + 1.371 + 0.944) / 3 = 3.533 / 3 = 1.177667\n        hour11: (1.279 + 1.310 + 1.097) / 3 = 3.686 / 3 = 1.228667\n        hour12: (1.249 + 1.249 + 1.218) / 3 = 3.716 / 3 = 1.238667\n        hour13: (1.249 + 1.218 + 1.127) / 3 = 3.594 / 3 = 1.198000\n        hour14: (1.218 + 1.188 + 1.066) / 3 = 3.472 / 3 = 1.157333\n        hour15: (1.279 + 1.218 + 1.097) / 3 = 3.594 / 3 = 1.198000\n        hour16: (1.249 + 1.188 + 1.218) / 3 = 3.655 / 3 = 1.218333\n        hour17: (1.157 + 1.310 + 1.310) / 3 = 3.777 / 3 = 1.259000\n        hour18: (1.127 + 1.097 + 1.188) / 3 = 3.412 / 3 = 1.137333\n        hour19: (1.066 + 1.157 + 1.340) / 3 = 3.563 / 3 = 1.187667\n        hour20: (1.188 + 1.005 + 1.157) / 3 = 3.35 / 3 = 1.116667\n        hour21: (1.188 + 1.097 + 1.218) / 3 = 3.503 / 3 = 1.167667\n        hour22: (1.188 + 1.249 + 1.249) / 3 = 3.686 / 3 = 1.228667\n        hour23: (1.127 + 1.218 + 0.640) / 3 = 2.985 / 3 = 0.995000\n\n 24. Now, we have 24 values (from hour0 to hour23). We will repeat these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 25. Generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-06-02 00:00:00 to 2017-06-02 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-06-03 00:00:00 to 2017-06-03 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-06-04 00:00:00 to 2017-06-04 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-06-05 00:00:00 to 2017-06-05 23:00:00\n\n 26. Format the answer as per requirement.\n\n 27. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 28. Let's create the data:\n\n        date: starting from '2017-06-02 00:00:00' to '2017-06-05 23:00:00' (96 points)\n\n        values: \n           2017-06-02 00:00:00: 1.289\n           2017-06-02 01:00:00: 1.086\n           ... and so on.\n\n 29. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n 30. But note: the last day of the given data is 2017-06-01 23:00:00, so the next day starts at 2017-06-02 00:00:00.\n\n 31. We'll generate the next 96 points.\n\n 32. Code for generating the dates in Python for clarity (but we are to write the answer):\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        start_date = '2017-06-02 00:00:00'\n        end_date = '2017-06-05 23:00:00'\n        date_range = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date, freq='H')\n\n        This gives 96 dates.\n\n 33. The values are the 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 34. We'll list the averages we computed, rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n        pattern = [\n            1.289, 1.086, 1.218, 1.198, 1.107, 0.985, \n            1.239, 1.361, 1.290, 1.168, 1.178, 1.229, \n            1.239, 1.198, 1.157, 1.198, 1.218, 1.259, \n            1.137, 1.188, 1.117, 1.168, 1.229, 0.995\n        ]\n\n        Then the full forecast = pattern * 4\n\n 35. But note: the computed averages have more than 3 decimals, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n        We did the calculation and then rounded.\n\n 36. Let's write the data:\n\n        We'll have 96 lines.\n\n 37. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-06-02 00:00:00 1.289\n2017-06-02 01:00:00 1.086\n2017-06-02 02:00:00 1.218\n2017-06-02 03:00:00 1.198\n2017-06-02 04:00:00 1.107\n2017-06-02 05:00:00 0.985\n2017-06-02 06:00:00 1.239\n2017-06-02 07:00:00 1.361\n2017-06-02 08:00:00 1.290\n2017-06-02 09:00:00 1.168\n2017-06-02 10:00:00 1.178\n2017-06-02 11:00:00 1.229\n2017-06-02 12:00:00 1.239\n2017-06-02 13:00:00 1.198\n2017-06-02 14:00:00 1.157\n2017-06-02 15:00:00 1.198\n2017-06-02 16:00:00 1.218\n2017-06-02 17:00:00 1.259\n2017-06-02 18:00:00 1.137\n2017-06-02 19:00:00 1.188\n2017-06-02 20:00:00 1.117\n2017-06-02 21:00:00 1.168\n2017-06-02 22:00:00 1.229\n2017-06-02 23:00:00 0.995\n... and then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 38. We'll generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 39. Note: The pattern is fixed for each day.\n\n 40. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 41. But note: the rounding. We computed:\n\n        hour0: 1.289333 -> 1.289\n        hour1: 1.086333 -> 1.086\n        hour2: 1.218333 -> 1.218\n        hour3: 1.198000 -> 1.198\n        hour4: 1.106667 -> 1.107   (because 1.106667 rounded to 1.107)\n        hour5: 0.984667 -> 0.985\n        hour6: 1.238667 -> 1.239\n        hour7: 1.360667 -> 1.361\n        hour8: 1.289667 -> 1.290\n        hour9: 1.167667 -> 1.168\n        hour10: 1.177667 -> 1.178\n        hour11: 1.228667 -> 1.229\n        hour12: 1.238667 -> 1.239\n        hour13: 1.198000 -> 1.198\n        hour14: 1.157333 -> 1.157\n        hour15: 1.198000 -> 1.198\n        hour16: 1.218333 -> 1.218\n        hour17: 1.259000 -> 1.259\n        hour18: 1.137333 -> 1.137\n        hour19: 1.187667 -> 1.188\n        hour20: 1.116667 -> 1.117\n        hour21: 1.167667 -> 1.168\n        hour22: 1.228667 -> 1.229\n        hour23: 0.995000 -> 0.995\n\n 42. So the pattern array (rounded) is:\n\n        [1.289, 1.086, 1.218, 1.198, 1.107, 0.985, \n         1.239, 1.361, 1.290, 1.168, 1.178, 1.229, \n         1.239, 1.198, 1.157, 1.198, 1.218, 1.259, \n         1.137, 1.188, 1.117, 1.168, 1.229, 0.995]\n\n 43. Now, we generate the next 96 points by repeating this pattern 4 times.\n\n 44. Write the answer in the required format.\n\n 45.
