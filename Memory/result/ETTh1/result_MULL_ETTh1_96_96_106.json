        "reasoning": "We are given 96 data points (from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 recorded dates (i.e., 96 hours ahead, which is 4 days).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? We note that in the provided data, there is a long stretch of constant value (-4.584) from 2017-08-31 00:00:00 to 2017-08-31 23:00:00 (24 hours). This might indicate missing data or an anomaly. However, the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided segment, we have 96 points without any explicit gap (all hours are present). So we have to assume that the provided 96 points are complete, but the future 96 might have missing? Actually, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" \u2014 meaning the provided data? But in the provided 96 points, we have 96 rows. Alternatively, it might mean that in the future 96 points, there could be missing? However, the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we have to provide 96 points without missing.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n\n 3. Approach:\n    - We note that the data has a daily pattern? Let's look: \n        On 2017-08-29: values start at 4.868 (00:00) and then go negative, with a dip in the evening (lowest at -4.158 at 18:00).\n        On 2017-08-30: similar pattern? It starts at -3.909 (00:00) and goes down to -5.934 at 12:00 and then recovers a bit but stays negative.\n        On 2017-08-31: constant -4.584 for the entire day. This is unusual and might be an anomaly or missing data. But we are given it as is.\n        Then on 2017-09-01: the pattern breaks? It starts at -0.497 and then goes negative again.\n\n    - Given the complexity and the presence of an anomaly (constant value for a whole day), we might need a robust method.\n\n 4. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points, we must generate 96 values.\n\n 5. We can use a time series model. Given the hourly data, we might consider:\n    - Seasonal component: daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so weekly is not feasible.\n    - We can use a simple moving average, exponential smoothing, or an ARIMA model.\n\n 6. However, note the anomaly on 2017-08-31. We might treat that day as an outlier. But without more context, we can either:\n    a) Use the entire data including the anomaly to forecast.\n    b) Impute the anomaly with more reasonable values? But the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96, and we are not asked to fix the past.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we will use a model that can handle the anomaly. One robust method is to use the median of each hour of the previous days (excluding the anomaly day) to forecast the next days.\n\n    Steps for a simple approach:\n    - We have 3 days without the constant value? Actually, 2017-08-29, 2017-08-30, and 2017-09-01. But 2017-08-31 is constant and might be an error.\n\n    - We can create an hourly profile by taking the median (or mean) of the same hour from the available non-anomaly days (i.e., 29th, 30th, and 1st). However, note that 1st of September is a different month and might have different behavior? But we have only 3 days.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-01) as the pattern for the next days? But that day also has a different pattern.\n\n 8. Considering the above, we decide to use the median of the three days (29th, 30th, and 1st) for each hour. But note: the 31st is an anomaly and we skip it.\n\n    How many non-anomaly days? \n        Day1: 2017-08-29 (Tuesday)\n        Day2: 2017-08-30 (Wednesday)\n        Day3: 2017-09-01 (Friday)   [Note: 2017-08-31 was Thursday and was constant]\n\n    We have three days, but they are not consecutive? Actually, 29,30, and 1st (skipping 31st). The 1st is the next day after 31st.\n\n    We can compute for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) the median of the three values from the three days.\n\n    Example for 00:00:\n        2017-08-29 00:00:00: 4.868\n        2017-08-30 00:00:00: -3.909\n        2017-09-01 00:00:00: -0.497\n        Median: sort: -3.909, -0.497, 4.868 -> median is -0.497\n\n    But note: the 00:00 on 2017-08-29 is positive and the others are negative. The median is the middle value: -0.497.\n\n    Similarly, we compute for each hour.\n\n 9. Then we can use this hourly profile for the next 4 days (96 hours). That is, for each day in the forecast period, we assign the median value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 10. Why median? Because it is robust to outliers. The 00:00 on 2017-08-29 (4.868) is an outlier compared to the other two, so median gives -0.497.\n\n 11. However, note that the pattern might change. But with only 3 days of non-anomaly data, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 12. Steps to generate the forecast_dates = pd.date_range(start='2017-09-02 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 13. For each hour in [0,23] (the hour of the day), we have a value (the median of the three days at that hour). Then we repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 14. But note: the three days we have are not all normal? The 2017-08-29 and 2017-08-30 are in August and 2017-09-01 is in September. There might be a monthly pattern? But we don't have enough data.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-01) as the pattern for the next days? But that day might be a Friday and the next days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday? So we might need to adjust for day of week? But we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality.\n\n 16. Given the constraints, we will use the median method.\n\n 17. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00: [4.868, -3.909, -0.497] -> sorted: [-3.909, -0.497, 4.868] -> median = -0.497\n     Hour 01: [-0.604, -3.660, 0.142] -> sorted: [-3.660, -0.604, 0.142] -> median = -0.604\n     Hour 02: [-1.528, -3.340, 0.071] -> sorted: [-3.340, -1.528, 0.071] -> median = -1.528\n     Hour 03: [-0.640, -4.584, -0.675] -> but wait, the 2017-08-31 is an anomaly? We are excluding 2017-08-31? Actually, we are only using 29th, 30th, and 1st. So for 03:00:\n          29th: -0.640, 30th: -4.584? -> wait, 30th at 03:00 is -4.584? But 30th is 2017-08-30, which we are including? \n          Actually, we are including 29th, 30th, and 1st. The 30th is not the anomaly day? The anomaly day is 31st. So we include 30th.\n\n          So for 03: \n            2017-08-29 03:00: -0.640\n            2017-08-30 03:00: -4.584\n            2017-09-01 03:00: -0.675\n          Sorted: [-4.584, -0.675, -0.640] -> median = -0.675\n\n     But wait, the 2017-08-30 03:00 is -4.584, which is the same as the anomaly day? Actually, the anomaly day is 2017-08-31 (whole day constant). The 2017-08-30 is a normal day? It has variation. So we include it.\n\n 18. However, note that the 2017-08-30 03:00 is -4.584, which is an outlier? But we are using median so it is robust.\n\n 19. We compute the median for each hour (0 to 23) from the three days: 29th, 30th, and 1st.\n\n 20. Then for the next 4 days (2017-09-02 to 2017-09-05), we assign:\n        Day 1 (2017-09-02): use the median for hour0, hour1, ... hour23\n        Day 2 (2017-09-03): same pattern (the same medians)\n        Day 3 (2017-09-04): same pattern\n        Day 4 (2017-09-05): same pattern\n\n 21. Why the same pattern for all days? Because we don't have data to model weekly seasonality, and the three days we have are from different weekdays. We are essentially assuming a constant daily pattern.\n\n 22. Let's compute the medians:\n\n      Hour 00: [4.868, -3.909, -0.497] -> median = -0.497\n      Hour 01: [-0.604, -3.660, 0.142] -> median = [-3.660, -0.604, 0.142] -> -0.604\n      Hour 02: [-1.528, -3.340, 0.071] -> [-3.340, -1.528, 0.071] -> -1.528\n      Hour 03: [-0.640, -4.584, -0.675] -> [-4.584, -0.675, -0.640] -> -0.675\n          Actually, sorted: -4.584, -0.675, -0.640 -> the middle is -0.675? \n          But wait: \n            -4.584 (smallest)\n            -0.675 \n            -0.640 (largest)\n          So the middle one is -0.675? Actually, no: when sorted: \n            [-4.584, -0.675, -0.640] -> the middle is the second one: -0.675.\n\n      Hour 04: [-1.670, -2.949, 0.000] -> sorted: [-2.949, -1.670, 0.000] -> median = -1.670\n      Hour 05: [-1.883, -3.376, 0.036] -> sorted: [-3.376, -1.883, 0.036] -> median = -1.883\n      Hour 06: [-2.025, -4.335, -1.528] -> sorted: [-4.335, -2.025, -1.528] -> wait, sorted: [-4.335, -2.025, -1.528] -> the middle is -2.025\n          Actually: \n            -4.335 (smallest)\n            -2.025 \n            -1.528 (largest) -> so median is -2.025\n\n      Hour 07: [-1.031, -3.411, -0.995] -> sorted: [-3.411, -1.031, -0.995] -> wait, sorted: [-3.411, -1.031, -0.995] -> but -1.031 is less than -0.995? \n          Actually: -3.411, then -1.031, then -0.995? That's not sorted. \n          Correct sorted: [-3.411, -1.031, -0.995] -> because -1.031 is -1.031 and -0.995 is greater than -1.031? \n          Actually: -1.031 is -1.031 and -0.995 is -0.995 -> which is greater? -0.995 > -1.031. So sorted: [-3.411, -1.031, -0.995] -> then the median is -1.031.\n\n      But wait: the values for 07:00:\n          29th: -1.031\n          30th: -3.411\n          1st: -0.995\n          Sorted: [-3.411, -1.031, -0.995] -> but that is not sorted by value? \n          Actually, we sort numerically: \n            -3.411, -1.031, -0.995 -> that is in increasing order? \n            Because -3.411 < -1.031 < -0.995? \n          But wait: -3.411 is the smallest, then -1.031 is next (because -1.031 is greater than -3.411), and then -0.995 is the largest? \n          Actually: -0.995 is greater than -1.031? Yes, because -0.995 is to the right of -1.031 on the number line.\n\n          So sorted: [-3.411, -1.031, -0.995] -> then the median is the middle value: -1.031.\n\n      Hour 08: [-1.599, -3.696, -1.670] -> sorted: [-3.696, -1.670, -1.599] -> wait, let me sort: \n          -3.696, -1.670, -1.599 -> sorted: [-3.696, -1.670, -1.599] -> median = -1.670? \n          Actually, the values: \n            29th: -1.599\n            30th: -3.696\n            1st: -1.670\n          Sorted: [-3.696, -1.670, -1.599] -> median is -1.670.\n\n      Hour 09: [-1.954, -5.757, -1.635] -> sorted: [-5.757, -1.954, -1.635] -> median = -1.954\n      Hour 10: [-2.097, -5.010, -1.031] -> sorted: [-5.010, -2.097, -1.031] -> median = -2.097\n      Hour 11: [-2.274, -5.046, -2.914] -> sorted: [-5.046, -2.914, -2.274] -> median = -2.914\n      Hour 12: [-2.381, -5.934, -3.482] -> sorted: [-5.934, -3.482, -2.381] -> median = -3.482\n      Hour 13: [-2.097, -5.188, -2.630] -> sorted: [-5.188, -2.630, -2.097] -> median = -2.630\n      Hour 14: [-1.670, -4.193, -2.985] -> sorted: [-4.193, -2.985, -1.670] -> median = -2.985\n      Hour 15: [-1.919, -4.975, 0.071] -> sorted: [-4.975, -1.919, 0.071] -> median = -1.919\n      Hour 16: [-2.914, -5.224, -1.919] -> sorted: [-5.224, -2.914, -1.919] -> median = -2.914\n      Hour 17: [-2.559, -5.437, -2.274] -> sorted: [-5.437, -2.559, -2.274] -> median = -2.559\n      Hour 18: [-4.158, -5.899, -2.381] -> sorted: [-5.899, -4.158, -2.381] -> median = -4.158\n      Hour 19: [-3.482, -5.757, -2.559] -> sorted: [-5.757, -3.482, -2.559] -> median = -3.482\n      Hour 20: [-3.305, -5.863, -2.736] -> sorted: [-5.863, -3.305, -2.736] -> median = -3.305\n      Hour 21: [-3.092, -5.863, -3.305] -> sorted: [-5.863, -3.305, -3.092] -> wait, let me sort: \n          -5.863, then -3.305, then -3.092? But -3.305 is greater than -3.092? No: -3.305 is less than -3.092? \n          Actually: -3.305 < -3.092? Yes, because -3.305 is more negative. So sorted: [-5.863, -3.305, -3.092] -> median = -3.305\n          But wait: the values are:\n            29th: -3.092\n            30th: -5.863\n            1st: -3.305\n          Actually, the 1st at 21:00 is -3.305? The data: \n            2017-09-01 21:00:00 -3.305 -> yes.\n          So sorted: [-5.863, -3.305, -3.092] -> the middle is -3.305.\n\n      Hour 22: [-2.310, -5.934, -2.807] -> sorted: [-5.934, -2.807, -2.310] -> median = -2.807\n      But wait: \n          29th: -2.310\n          30th: -5.934\n          1st: -2.807\n          Sorted: [-5.934, -2.807, -2.310] -> median = -2.807\n\n      Hour 23: [-3.696, -4.620, -1.954] -> sorted: [-4.620, -3.696, -1.954] -> median = -3.696\n\n 23. So the daily pattern (median for each hour) is:\n\n      hour00: -0.497\n      hour01: -0.604\n      hour02: -1.528\n      hour03: -0.675\n      hour04: -1.670\n      hour05: -1.883\n      hour06: -2.025\n      hour07: -1.031\n      hour08: -1.670\n      hour09: -1.954\n      hour10: -2.097\n      hour11: -2.914\n      hour12: -3.482\n      hour13: -2.630\n      hour14: -2.985\n      hour15: -1.919\n      hour16: -2.914\n      hour17: -2.559\n      hour18: -4.158\n      hour19: -3.482\n      hour20: -3.305\n      hour21: -3.305\n      hour22: -2.807\n      hour23: -3.696\n\n 24. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this pattern 4 times.\n\n 25. The forecast period starts at 2017-09-02 00:00:00 (which is a Saturday) and ends at 2017-09-05 23:00:00 (Tuesday). But we are using the same pattern for each day.\n\n 26. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 27. Note: The problem says the data might have missing values? But we are providing the complete 96 points. We are not missing any.\n\n 28. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-02 00:00:00  -0.497\n2017-09-02 01:00:00  -0.604\n... \n2017-09-05 23:00:00  -3.696\n```\n\n 29. We generate the dates: \n        Start: 2017-09-02 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 31. Let's code the pattern:\n\n      pattern = [\n          -0.497, -0.604, -1.528, -0.675, -1.670, -1.883, -2.025, -1.031, \n          -1.670, -1.954, -2.097, -2.914, -3.482, -2.630, -2.985, -1.919,\n          -2.914, -2.559, -4.158, -3.482, -3.305, -3.305, -2.807, -3.696\n      ]\n\n 32. For day 1 (2017-09-02): pattern[0] to pattern[23]\n      day 2: same pattern\n      day 3: same\n      day 4: same\n\n 33. We output the data.\n\n 34. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We'll keep the same.\n\n 35. However, the medians we computed are exactly as in the data? We are taking the median of the given numbers, so we can use the exact value.\n\n 36. Let's write the data.\n\n 37. We must be cautious: the pattern for the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-09-02 (Saturday) -> we use the pattern\n      Day 2: 2017-09-03 (Sunday)\n      Day 3: 2017-09-04 (Monday)\n      Day 4: 2017-09-05 (Tuesday)\n\n 38. We are not adjusting for weekends? Because we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality.\n\n 39. We output the data.\n\n 40. Let's generate the 96 lines.\n\n 41. We'll create a list of dates and then assign the pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 42. Code:\n\n      base_date = datetime(2017,9,2)\n      dates = [base_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n      values = pattern * 4   # because 24*4=96\n\n 43. Then we output each date in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n 44. But note: the pattern we computed for hour00 is -0.497, which is exactly as in the data? Yes.\n\n 45. We write the answer.\n\n 46. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output all 96.\n\n 47. Let's do it.\n\n 48. We note that the medians we computed are based on the three days. This is a simple and robust method.\n\n 49. If we had more data, we might use a more sophisticated model, but with only 4 days (and one of them anomaly) we use this.\n\n 50. We output the answer in the required format.\n",
