        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-22 00:00:00 to 2016-08-25 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-26 00:00:00 to 2016-08-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours in a day). Therefore, we can use a seasonal time series model.\n 2. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points ahead, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend.\n 3. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast might need to account for the possibility of missing data in the future? \n    But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n    However, the provided 96 points do not have any missing values. So we assume the provided data is complete? But the future data we are to forecast might have missing values? \n    Actually, the instruction says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\" and then we are to forecast the next 96. The problem says the dataset has missing values, but the provided 96 are complete? \n    We are to forecast the next 96, and we must provide the complete data (without missing values). So we will produce 96-point forecast without any missing values.\n\n 4. We can use a model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n Given the data, we observe:\n   - There is a daily pattern: the load is higher during the night and early morning (e.g., 00:00 to 05:00) and lower during the day? \n     Actually, looking at the data: \n        On 2016-08-22: \n          00:00: 14.001, then decreases until 09:00 (6.396), then increases again until 12:00? and then fluctuates.\n        But let's see the pattern: \n          It starts high at midnight, then decreases until around 09:00, then a small peak at 10:00-11:00, then decreases again until 15:00-16:00, then increases in the evening.\n\n 5. We can try to fit a model. However, without the ability to run code, we must rely on typical patterns and extrapolation.\n\n 6. Since we cannot run actual code, we have to use a heuristic:\n    - We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then use that pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours) but adjust for any trend.\n\n 7. Let's check for trend: \n      The data is only for 4 days. We can compute the average for each day:\n        Day1 (2016-08-22): average = (14.001+13.432+...+10.909)/24 -> we don't have to compute exactly, but we can see the values.\n        Instead, we can look at the overall level: \n          Day1: min=5.863, max=14.001\n          Day2: min=6.467, max=12.331\n          Day3: min=6.503, max=11.904\n          Day4: min=6.716, max=12.650\n\n      There is no clear upward or downward trend in the 4 days. So we can assume stationarity in the mean.\n\n 8. Approach: \n      We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 9. Steps for the average for hour 0 (00:00): \n      (14.001 + 11.549 + 11.584 + 12.473) / 4 = \n        14.001 + 11.549 = 25.55; +11.584=37.134; +12.473=49.607 -> 49.607/4 = 12.40175\n\n    Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00): \n      13.432, 12.331, 10.412, 10.518 -> (13.432+12.331+10.412+10.518)/4 = 46.693/4 = 11.67325\n\n    But note: the last day (2016-08-25) has 24 hours? Actually, the data ends at 2016-08-25 23:00:00, so we have 4 full days.\n\n 10. We do this for each hour (0 to 23) and then repeat the same pattern for the next 4 days (2016-08-26 to 2016-08-29).\n\n 11. However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are to provide the complete data. Since we are using the average of the same hour, we are not introducing any missing values.\n\n 12. But what if the future period includes a holiday or a different pattern? We don't have that information, so we stick to the average.\n\n 13.
