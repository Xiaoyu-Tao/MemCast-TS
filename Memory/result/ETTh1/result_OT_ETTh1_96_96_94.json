        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing value problem? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided data, we don't see any missing values in the given 96 points. However, we must be cautious for the forecast.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model. Given the context, we might use a model that can handle potential seasonality (daily seasonality of 24 hours) and trends.\n\n 3. We can use an ARIMA model or Exponential Smoothing, but note that we have multiple seasonality? However, the data is hourly and we are only given 4 days. We might consider a simple model due to the limited data.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but with only 96 points, it's challenging.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a simple Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). However, note that we have only 4 days (so 4 seasonal periods) which is very few for seasonal models.\n\n 6. Another approach: use an autoregressive model (like AR) with lags at 24 hours (daily seasonality). We can set up an AR model with lags up to 24.\n\n 7. But note: the data might have a daily pattern. Let's observe the provided data:\n\n    - The temperature seems to have a daily cycle: lower at night and higher during the day? But looking at the data, it's not very clear. For example, on 2017-07-12, the temperature starts at 21.17 at midnight, then goes up to 22.23 at 1am, then down to 20.82 at 6am, then up to 22.44 at 8am, and then peaks at 23.28 at 5pm, then decreases.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we must generate the forecast. We'll use a simple method: \n\n    Option: Use the last 24 hours as a template and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days we have to form a daily profile and then use that to forecast the next four days? But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have a clear trend in 4 days.\n\n 10. We can do:\n\n     - Calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have.\n     - Then, use that average as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n     However, we must account for any trend? We can compute the overall level of the series and adjust the daily profile.\n\n 11. Steps for the naive seasonal forecast:\n\n      a. Extract the hour of the day for each record.\n      b. Group by hour and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n      c. Since we have 4 days, we have 4 observations per hour. We can take the mean.\n\n      But note: the data might have a slight increasing or decreasing trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-07-12): average = (21.174+22.23+...+22.089001)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n          We don't need exact, but let's see the last day (2017-07-15) and the first day? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the last day as the base and then adjust by the average daily profile? \n\n 12. However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data? But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. So for the forecast, we assume we are to generate 96 points without missing.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity and the requirement, we'll use the average by hour of day over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        - Create a list of the 4 days of data (96 points).\n        - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), take the average of the 4 values at that hour.\n\n        Example: \n          For hour 0: (21.174000 + 22.089001 + 22.018999 + 21.808001) / 4\n          ... and so on.\n\n        - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we simply repeat the computed 24-hour profile 4 times.\n\n 14. But note: what if there is a trend? We can adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n      We can compute the average of the last day (2017-07-15) and the average of the entire 4 days. Then adjust the daily profile by the ratio? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the last value of the starting point and then adjust the daily pattern? \n\n 15. We can do:\n\n      Let the daily profile be the average for each hour over the 4 days: H[0], H[1], ... H[23]\n\n      Then, for the first forecast day (2017-07-16), we can set the level to the last day's average? \n\n      But note: the last day (2017-07-15) average is:\n\n        We have 24 points: \n          21.808001, 21.878000, 22.230000, 21.597000, 21.455999, 20.962999, 21.174000, 22.089001, 22.792000, 23.355000, 21.104000, 19.979000, 20.893000, 20.681999, 22.089001, 22.933001, 23.917999, 23.073999, 23.566000, 23.073999, 22.722000, 22.933001, 22.299999, 22.580999\n\n        Average = (sum of above) / 24 = ?\n\n        We can compute: \n          Let me quickly add: \n          21.808+21.878+22.23+21.597+21.456+20.963+21.174+22.089+22.792+23.355+21.104+19.979+20.893+20.682+22.089+22.933+23.918+23.074+23.566+23.074+22.722+22.933+22.3+22.581\n\n        = 21.808+21.878=43.686\n        +22.23=65.916\n        +21.597=87.513\n        +21.456=108.969\n        +20.963=129.932\n        +21.174=151.106\n        +22.089=173.195\n        +22.792=196.987\n        +23.355=220.342\n        +21.104=241.446\n        +19.979=261.425\n        +20.893=282.318\n        +20.682=303.0\n        +22.089=325.089\n        +22.933=348.022\n        +23.918=371.94\n        +23.074=395.014\n        +23.566=418.58\n        +23.074=441.654\n        +22.722=464.376\n        +22.933=487.309\n        +22.3=509.609\n        +22.581=532.19\n\n        Average = 532.19 / 24 = 22.1745833333\n\n        Now, the overall average for the entire 4 days? We have 96 points. We can compute the average of all 96? But that might be too much. Alternatively, we can compute the average of the daily profiles? \n\n        We have the daily profile as the average per hour over 4 days. Then the overall average would be the average of the 24 hourly averages? \n\n        But note: the daily profile is computed by averaging 4 points for each hour. Then the overall average is the same as the average of the 96 points.\n\n        Let the overall average be A_total.\n\n        Then, for the next days, we can set the level to the last day's average (22.1746) and then adjust the daily profile by a multiplicative factor? Or additive? \n\n        Since temperature is additive, we can do additive adjustment: \n\n          For each hour i in the daily profile, we have H[i]. The overall average of the daily profile (i.e., the average of H[0] to H[23]) is A_profile.\n\n          Then, the forecast for hour i in the future is: \n             forecast = H[i] + (last_day_avg - A_profile)\n\n        Why? We are shifting the entire daily profile by the difference between the last day's average and the overall average of the profile.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can also use the last day's average as the base and then adjust the daily profile to have that average? \n\n        We can scale the daily profile by: \n          new_H[i] = H[i] * (last_day_avg / A_profile)   -> multiplicative\n\n        But additive is more common for temperatures.\n\n 17. We'll do additive:\n\n        Let A_profile = average of the 24 hourly averages (which is the same as the overall average of the 96 points).\n\n        Then, for each hour i in the forecast period, the value = H[i] + (last_day_avg - A_profile)\n\n        But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We assume the same daily profile for each day? \n\n 18. However, we don't have the overall average of the 96 points? We can compute it.\n\n        We have 96 points. We can sum all the OT values and divide by 96.\n\n        But we don't have the exact sum? We can approximate by the 4 daily averages? \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the overall average by:\n\n          A_total = (average_day1 + average_day2 + average_day3 + average_day4) / 4\n\n        But that is not exact because the days might have different lengths? They are all 24.\n\n        Actually, the overall average is the average of the 4 daily averages? \n\n          Let: \n            d1 = average of day1 (2017-07-12)\n            d2 = average of day2 (2017-07-13)\n            d3 = average of day3 (2017-07-14)\n            d4 = average of day4 (2017-07-15) = 22.1746\n\n        Then A_total = (d1+d2+d3+d4)/4.\n\n        But we don't have d1, d2, d3? We can compute them? \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the entire 96 points? \n\n        Since we have the data, we can do:\n\n          total_sum = 0\n          for each row in the 96 rows: total_sum += OT\n\n          A_total = total_sum / 96\n\n        But we don't have the data in a list? We can use the provided data and add them.\n\n        However, to save time, we can approximate. But we are going to write code? Actually, we are to provide the forecast.\n\n        Since we are to provide the forecast, we can do without the exact overall average? We can compute the daily profile and then the overall average of the profile is the same as the overall average of the data? \n\n        How? The daily profile is computed by averaging the 4 days for each hour. Then the average of the 24 hourly averages is:\n\n          (sum_{i=0}^{23} H[i]) / 24 = (sum_{i=0}^{23} [ (x_i1 + x_i2 + x_i3 + x_i4)/4 ]) / 24\n          = ( (sum_{all data}) / 4 ) / 24 = (sum_{all data}) / 96) = A_total.\n\n        So the average of the 24 H[i] is A_total.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n          adjustment = last_day_avg - A_total\n\n        But we don't have A_total? We can compute it by averaging the 24 H[i]? \n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Compute H[0] to H[23] (the average for each hour over 4 days).\n          Step 2: Compute A_total = average of H[0..23] (which is the same as the overall average of the 96 points).\n          Step 3: Compute last_day_avg (which we have for 2017-07-15: 22.1746).\n          Step 4: adjustment = last_day_avg - A_total\n          Step 5: For each hour i in the next 96 hours (which is 4 days * 24 hours), \n                  forecast_value = H[i mod 24] + adjustment\n\n 19. But note: the last day average is 22.1746, and if the overall average A_total is, say, 22.0, then we add 0.1746 to every hour? \n\n 20. Let's compute the daily profile and A_total.\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and accumulate the 4 values.\n\n     Hour 0: \n        2017-07-12: 21.174\n        2017-07-13: 22.089001\n        2017-07-14: 22.018999\n        2017-07-15: 21.808001\n        H[0] = (21.174 + 22.089001 + 22.018999 + 21.808001) / 4 = 21.7725\n\n     Hour 1:\n        2017-07-12: 22.23\n        2017-07-13: 21.667\n        2017-07-14: 22.580999\n        2017-07-15: 21.878\n        H[1] = (22.23 + 21.667 + 22.580999 + 21.878) /4 = 22.08899975\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n     Then we compute the average of H[0] to H[23] to get A_total.\n\n 21. However, we are to provide the forecast for 96 points. We can do the computation programmatically? But we are to write the answer in a text box.\n\n     We can do the computation for the 24 hourly averages and then the overall average, then adjust.\n\n     But note: we are to provide the forecast for 96 points. We can compute the 24 (for the next day) and then repeat the same 24 for 4 days? \n\n     Actually, we are going to use the same adjusted daily profile for each of the 4 days.\n\n 22. Implementation:\n\n     We'll compute:\n\n        H = [0]*24   # to store the sum for each hour\n        count = [4]*24   # we have 4 days, so 4 points per hour\n\n        But we have the data? We can iterate the given 96 points and accumulate by hour.\n\n        How to get the hour from the date? The date string is the index? We can parse the time part.\n\n        Actually, the data is in order: first 24 for day1, then day2, etc.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          for i in range(96):\n              hour = i % 24\n              H[hour] += OT[i]\n\n        Then, for each hour, H[hour] /= 4\n\n        Then, A_total = sum(H) / 24\n\n        Then, adjustment = last_day_avg - A_total\n\n        Then, for the forecast:\n\n          for day in range(4):   # 4 days\n             for hour in range(24):\n                 value = H[hour] + adjustment\n                 # and then output the date: starting from 2017-07-16 00:00:00\n\n 23. But we don't have the data in a list? We have it as a string. We can parse the data? \n\n     Alternatively, we can note that the last day (2017-07-15) is the last 24 points. We can compute the last_day_avg from the last 24 points.\n\n 24. Since we are to do it manually, we can compute the daily profile and the adjustment.\n\n     However, to save time and given the constraints, we can use a simpler method: \n\n        We use the daily profile without adjustment? \n\n        Why? Because the overall average of the last day (22.1746) is close to the overall average of the entire data? \n\n        We can compute the overall average of the entire data? \n\n        We have 96 points. We can add them all? \n\n        But that is tedious. Alternatively, we can assume that the daily profile is representative and use it as is.\n\n 25. Given the time, we decide to use the daily profile without adjustment. \n\n     Steps:\n\n        Compute H[0..23] as the average for each hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days, we output:\n\n            Day1: 2017-07-16: H[0] to H[23]\n            Day2: 2017-07-17: H[0] to H[23]\n            Day3: 2017-07-18: H[0] to H[23]\n            Day4: 2017-07-19: H[0] to H[23]\n\n 26. But note: the last day is 2017-07-15, so the next day is 2017-07-16.\n\n 27. How to compute H[0..23]? \n\n     We'll create an array for H of 24 zeros.\n\n     Then, we go through the 96 points in order. The first 24 are for 2017-07-12 (hour0 to hour23), then 2017-07-13, etc.\n\n     We can do:\n\n        H = [0.0]*24\n        # the data is given in 96 rows. We split into 4 chunks of 24.\n\n        chunk1 = rows[0:24]   # 2017-07-12\n        chunk2 = rows[24:48]  # 2017-07-13\n        chunk3 = rows[48:72]  # 2017-07-14\n        chunk4 = rows[72:96]  # 2017-07-15\n\n        Then for hour i (0<=i<24):\n            H[i] = (chunk1[i] + chunk2[i] + chunk3[i] + chunk4[i]) / 4.0\n\n 28. Then, the forecast for 2017-07-16 00:00:00 is H[0], 01:00:00 is H[1], ... until 23:00:00 is H[23].\n\n     Then 2017-07-17 00:00:00 is H[0], and so on.\n\n 29. We must generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-16 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-07-16 01:00:00 ... until 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll compute H[i] for i in 0..23.\n\n     We'll list the 96 points in order. The given data:\n\n        Row0: 2017-07-12 00:00:00 -> 21.174000\n        Row1: 01:00:00 -> 22.230000\n        ...\n        Row23: 23:00:00 -> 22.089001\n\n        Row24: 2017-07-13 00:00:00 -> 22.089001\n        Row25: 01:00:00 -> 21.667000\n        ...\n\n        Row48: 2017-07-14 00:00:00 -> 22.018999\n        Row49: 01:00:00 -> 22.580999\n        ...\n\n        Row72: 2017-07-15 00:00:00 -> 21.808001\n        Row73: 01:00:00 -> 21.878000\n        ...\n\n        Row95: 2017-07-15 23:00:00 -> 22.580999\n\n 31. Now, compute H[0] (midnight):\n\n        H[0] = (row0 + row24 + row48 + row72) / 4\n             = (21.174000 + 22.089001 + 22.018999 + 21.808001) / 4\n             = (21.174000 + 22.089001 = 43.263001; +22.018999=65.282; +21.808001=87.09) -> 87.09/4 = 21.77250025\n\n     H[1] = (row1 + row25 + row49 + row73) / 4\n          = (22.230000 + 21.667000 + 22.580999 + 21.878000) / 4\n          = (22.23+21.667=43.897; +22.580999=66.477999; +21.878=88.355999) -> 88.355999/4 = 22.08899975\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 32. We'll compute all 24 and then use them for the forecast.\n\n 33. But note: we are to provide 96 points. We can write a program to do it? But we are to output in text.\n\n     We can compute the 24 H[i] values and then list them 4 times.\n\n 34. However, we must output the exact dates and the forecasted OT.\n\n 35. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-16 00:00:00, then 1 hour increment until 96 steps.\n\n 36. Steps:\n\n        dates = []\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 7, 16, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n        Then, the OT values: \n            i from 0 to 95: \n                hour_index = i % 24\n                OT_value = H[hour_index]\n\n 37. But we haven't computed H for all 24 hours.
