        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to predict the next 96 hours.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But in the provided segment, we have complete data. For forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete for modeling.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, we can try to capture:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Possibly weekly seasonality, but we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly. Therefore, we focus on daily pattern.\n\n 4. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead (2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00) ).\n\n 5. We are required to output the next 96 dates and the forecasted HULL values in the same format.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data is short, we can use a model that handles seasonality. We can use:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data has negative values (e.g., -0.134) so we cannot use models that require positive data (like multiplicative seasonality) without transformation.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model (like Prophet) but the data is very short.\n\n Given the constraints, we choose SARIMA: We will try to fit a seasonal ARIMA model with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24).\n\n But note: with only 4 days, we have limited data for seasonal modeling. We might have to use a simple model.\n\n Steps for SARIMA:\n   - Check stationarity: We might need to take differences (both regular and seasonal).\n   - We have 96 points, so we can do a seasonal difference (lag 24) and then check for stationarity.\n\n However, due to the complexity and the fact that we are to generate 96 points (which is the same length as the input) and the data is short, we might also use a naive method: \n   - Use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But that would ignore trends and recent patterns.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a rolling forecast method, but we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Given the problem, we must provide the next 96 points. We will use a simple model: \n   - We will decompose the time series and then forecast the components.\n\n But note: the data has negative values so additive decomposition is acceptable.\n\n However, due to the short length, we can also consider using the last available day (2017-06-21) as a template and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n But let's try to use a model-based approach.\n\n We'll use an automated approach to select the best SARIMA model using AIC. But with only 96 points, we cannot use too many parameters.\n\n We'll use:\n   - d: 1 (since there might be a trend) \n   - D: 1 (for seasonal differencing with period 24)\n   - Then we try p, q, P, Q in a small range (0 to 2) and choose the model with lowest AIC.\n\n However, note: we are in a constrained environment and we must output the forecast. We can use `pmdarima` to auto_arima, but since we are not in a code environment, we have to do it manually.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: \n   - We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We can compute the average pattern for the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n Steps for a simple method:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the average value for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n   Step 2: Look at the overall trend: we can compute the daily average and see if there is a trend? \n        Day 1: 2017-06-18: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: 2017-06-19: average = ...\n        Day 3: 2017-06-20: average = ...\n        Day 4: 2017-06-21: average = ...\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n        Day1 (06-18): \n          1.875, 1.674, 2.478, 1.808, 0.134 -> average = (sum of 24) / 24\n          We can calculate: \n        We don't have to do by hand, but we can note that the data doesn't show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n   Step 3: If the trend is negligible, then we can use the average daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   However, we note that the last day (2017-06-21) has a different pattern? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-06-21) as the base and then adjust by the average of the previous days? \n\n   But the problem requires 96 points, so 4 days. We can use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form the next 4 days.\n\n   However, we must account for the fact that the data might have a trend. Let's check the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2017-06-18): \n          values: [1.875, 1.674, 2.478, 1.808, 1.942, 2.344, 0.134] ... we have 24 values.\n          average = (1.875+1.674+2.134)/24 -> we can compute:\n\n        We'll compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1: 1.9995 / 24? Actually, we have 24 values. Let me compute:\n\n        Day1: \n          1.875 + 1.674 + 2.478 + 1.808 + 1.942 + 2.344 + 1.474 + 2.545 + 2.813 + 4.220 + 3.416 + 2.880 +  + 2.411 + 1.206 + 2.076 + 2.210 + 2.076 + 1.340 + 0.938 + 0.469 + 0.268 + 0.000 + 0.670 + 0.134\n        = 1.875+1.674=3.549; +2.478=6.027; +1.808=7.835; +1.942=9.777; +2.344=12.121; +1.474=13.595; +2.545=16.14; +2.813=18.953; +4.22=23.173; +3.416=26.589; +2.88=29.469; +2.411=31.88; +1.206=33.086; +2.076=35.162; +2.21=37.372; +2.076=39.448; +1.34=40.788; +0.938=41.726; +0.469=42.195; +0.268=42.463; +0.0=42.463; +0.67=43.133; +0.134=43.267\n        average = 43.267 / 24 = 1.8028\n\n        Day2 (2017-06-19): \n          values: 1.407,0.804,...,0.938\n          sum = 1.407+0.804+1.942+1.206+1.206+2.076+1.808+2.612+2.277+3.148+2.478+3.416+2.21+3.416+3.014+2.478+1.608+1.407+0.268+0.0+(-0.134)+(-0.134)+0.0+0.938\n          = 1.407+0.804=2.211; +1.942=4.153; +1.206=5.359; +1.206=6.565; +2.076=8.641; +1.808=10.449; +2.612=13.061; +2.277=15.338; +3.148=18.486; +2.478=20.964; +3.416=24.38; +2.21=26.59; +3.416=30.006; +3.014=33.02; +2.478=35.498; +1.608=37.106; +1.407=38.513; +0.268=38.781; +0.0=38.781; -0.134=38.647; -0.134=38.513; +0.0=38.513; +0.938=39.451\n          average = 39.451/24 = 1.6438\n\n        Day3 (2017-06-20): \n          values: 1.808,1.474,1.608,2.143,1.741,1.808,1.942,1.674,2.21,1.474,2.21,3.55,3.349,2.21,4.019,1.875,1.34,1.139,0.469,0.469,0.201,0.737,0.804,0.804\n          sum = 1.808+1.474=3.282; +1.608=4.89; +2.143=7.033; +1.741=8.774; +1.808=10.582; +1.942=12.524; +1.674=14.198; +2.21=16.408; +1.474=17.882; +2.21=20.092; +3.55=23.642; +3.349=26.991; +2.21=29.201; +4.019=33.22; +1.875=35.095; +1.34=36.435; +1.139=37.574; +0.469=38.043; +0.469=38.512; +0.201=38.713; +0.737=39.45; +0.804=40.254; +0.804=41.058\n          average = 41.058/24 = 1.71075\n\n        Day4 (2017-06-21): \n          values: 1.608,1.608,1.608,2.21,0.201,1.942,1.34,2.143,2.143,1.808,1.474,1.541,1.808,2.746,4.488,2.746,0.938,1.139,0.67,0.067,0.201,0.0,0.0,1.741\n          sum = 1.608+1.608=3.216; +1.608=4.824; +2.21=7.034; +0.201=7.235; +1.942=9.177; +1.34=10.517; +2.143=12.66; +2.143=14.803; +1.808=16.611; +1.474=18.085; +1.541=19.626; +1.808=21.434; +2.746=24.18; +4.488=28.668; +2.746=31.414; +0.938=32.352; +1.139=33.491; +0.67=34.161; +0.067=34.228; +0.201=34.429; +0.0=34.429; +0.0=34.429; +1.741=36.17\n          average = 36.17/24 = 1.5071\n\n        The daily averages: \n          Day1: 1.8028\n          Day2: 1.6438\n          Day3: 1.71075\n          Day4: 1.5071\n\n        There is a slight downward trend? But not consistent. We might not have enough data to model the trend.\n\n 6. We decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form the next 4 days.\n\n    For each hour (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n\n    Example for hour 0: \n        Day1: 1.875\n        Day2: 1.407\n        Day3: 1.808\n        Day4: 1.608\n        average = (1.875+1.407+1.808+1.608)/4 = 6.698/4 = 1.6745\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, each hour 0 will be 1.6745.\n\n    But note: the data has negative values? In hour 20 and 21 of day2 we have negative. We must include them.\n\n    However, this method will smooth out the pattern and might not capture the recent variation.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences from the overall average? \n\n    But given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a clear trend, we go with the average per hour.\n\n 8. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n    hour0: (1.875 + 1.407 + 1.808 + 1.608) / 4 = (1.875+1.407=3.282; +1.808=5.09; +1.608=6.698) -> 6.698/4 = 1.6745\n    hour1: (1.674 + 0.804 + 1.474 + 1.608) / 4 = (1.674+0.804=2.478; +1.474=3.952; +1.608=5.56) -> 5.56/4 = 1.39\n    hour2: (2.478+1.942+1.608+1.608)/4 = (2.478+1.942=4.42; +1.608=6.028; +1.608=7.636) -> 7.636/4 = 1.909\n    hour3: (1.808+1.206+2.143+2.21)/4 = (1.808+1.206=3.014; +2.143=5.157; +2.21=7.367) -> 7.367/4 = 1.84175\n    hour4: (1.942+1.206+1.741+0.201)/4 = (1.942+1.206=3.148; +1.741=4.889; +0.201=5.09) -> 5.09/4 = 1.2725\n    hour5: (2.344+2.076+1.808+1.942)/4 = (2.344+2.076=4.42; +1.808=6.228; +1.942=8.17) -> 8.17/4 = 2.0425\n    hour6: (1.474+1.808+1.942+1.34)/4 = (1.474+1.808=3.282; +1.942=5.224; +1.34=6.564) -> 6.564/4 = 1.641\n    hour7: (2.545+2.612+1.674+2.143)/4 = (2.545+2.612=5.157; +1.674=6.831; +2.143=8.974) -> 8.974/4 = 2.2435\n    hour8: (2.813+2.277+2.21+2.143)/4 = (2.813+2.277=5.09; +2.21=7.3; +2.143=9.443) -> 9.443/4 = 2.36075\n    hour9: (4.22+3.148+1.474+1.808)/4 = (4.22+3.148=7.368; +1.474=8.842; +1.808=10.65) -> 10.65/4 = 2.6625\n    hour10: (3.416+2.478+2.21+1.474)/4 = (3.416+2.478=5.894; +2.21=8.104; +1.474=9.578) -> 9.578/4 = 2.3945\n    hour11: (2.88+3.416+3.55+1.541)/4 = (2.88+3.416=6.296; +3.55=9.846; +1.541=11.387) -> 11.387/4 = 2.84675\n    hour12: (2.411+2.21+3.349+1.808)/4 = (2.411+2.21=4.621; +3.349=7.97; +1.808=9.778) -> 9.778/4 = 2.4445\n    hour13: (1.206+3.416+2.21+2.746)/4 = (1.206+3.416=4.622; +2.21=6.832; +2.746=9.578) -> 9.578/4 = 2.3945\n    hour14: (2.076+3.014+4.019+4.488)/4 = (2.076+3.014=5.09; +4.019=9.109; +4.488=13.597) -> 13.597/4 = 3.39925\n    hour15: (2.21+2.478+1.875+2.746)/4 = (2.21+2.478=4.688; +1.875=6.563; +2.746=9.309) -> 9.309/4 = 2.32725\n    hour16: (2.076+1.608+1.34+0.938)/4 = (2.076+1.608=3.684; +1.34=5.024; +0.938=5.962) -> 5.962/4 = 1.4905\n    hour17: (1.34+1.407+1.139+1.139)/4 = (1.34+1.407=2.747; +1.139=3.886; +1.139=5.025) -> 5.025/4 = 1.25625\n    hour18: (0.938+0.268+0.469+0.67)/4 = (0.938+0.268=1.206; +0.469=1.675; +0.67=2.345) -> 2.345/4 = 0.58625\n    hour19: (0.469+0.0+0.469+0.067)/4 = (0.469+0.0=0.469; +0.469=0.938; +0.067=1.005) -> 1.005/4 = 0.25125\n    hour20: (0.268-0.134+0.201+0.201)/4 = (0.268-0.134=0.134; +0.201=0.335; +0.201=0.536) -> 0.536/4 = 0.134\n    hour21: (0.0-0.134+0.737+0.0)/4 = (0.0-0.134=-0.134; +0.737=0.603; +0.0=0.603) -> 0.603/4 = 0.15075\n    hour22: (0.67+0.0+0.804+0.0)/4 = (0.67+0.0=0.67; +0.804=1.474; +0.0=1.474) -> 1.474/4 = 0.3685\n    hour23: (0.134+0.938+0.804+1.741)/4 = (0.134+0.938=1.072; +0.804=1.876; +1.741=3.617) -> 3.617/4 = 0.90425\n\n 9.

You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be as in the example.\n\n We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date                 HULL\n        2017-06-22 00:00:00  [value]\n        ... 96 rows\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the input had 4 decimal places? We see up to 3. So we can round to 3 decimal places? \n\n The input has 3 decimal places. So we round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's recalculate the averages and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n    hour0: 1.6745 -> 1.675\n    hour1: 1.39 -> 1.390\n    hour2: 1.909 -> 1.909\n    hour3: 1.84175 -> 1.842\n    hour4: 1.2725 -> 1.273\n    hour5: 2.0425 -> 2.043\n    hour6: 1.641 -> 1.641\n    hour7: 2.2435 -> 2.244\n    hour8: 2.36075 -> 2.361\n    hour9: 2.6625 -> 2.663\n    hour10: 2.3945 -> 2.395\n    hour11: 2.84675 -> 2.847\n    hour12: 2.4445 -> 2.445\n    hour13: 2.3945 -> 2.395\n    hour14: 3.39925 -> 3.399\n    hour15: 2.32725 -> 2.327\n    hour16: 1.4905 -> 1.491\n    hour17: 1.25625 -> 1.256\n    hour18: 0.58625 -> 0.586\n    hour19: 0.25125 -> 0.251\n    hour20: 0.134 -> 0.134\n    hour21: 0.15075 -> 0.151\n    hour22: 0.3685 -> 0.369\n    hour23: 0.90425 -> 0.904\n\n But note: the input had negative values? In our averages, we have negative? Only hour20 and hour21 had negative in one day, but the average is positive? So we are okay.\n\n 14. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-22 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-06-25 23:00:00\n\n 15. We write the data accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are forecasting, so we are generating the full 96 points without missing.\n\n We'll output the data as described.\n\n But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the input might have missing? But we are given 96 points without missing. So we are safe.\n\n Let's generate the output.\n\n We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-06-22 00:00:00.\n\n        date = pd.date_range(start='2017-06-22 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n 16. Then we repeat the 24 values 4 times.\n\n 17. We output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"High UseLess Load\" and the column is \"HULL\", so we use that.\n\n We'll write the data in the answer block.\n\n But note: the example input had the date as index? We output as two columns: date and then HULL.\n\n We'll write:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2017-06-22 00:00:00  1.675\n        2017-06-22 01:00:00  1.390\n        ... \n\n 18. We must be cautious: the input had the date as a string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. We output the same.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output 96 rows.\n\n We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n But note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", meaning we must not skip any hour.\n\n We are generating 96 consecutive hours.\n\n We'll write the answer in the required format.\n",
