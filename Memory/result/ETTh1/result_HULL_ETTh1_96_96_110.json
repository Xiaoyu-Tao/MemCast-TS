        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to predict the next 96 hours.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we have to use the given 96 points to build a model and then forecast the next 96.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is a long horizon) and the data is hourly, we might consider a model that can capture:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - Possibly weekly seasonality (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not feasible to capture)\n\n However, note that the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history.\n\n Given the constraints, we are limited in model complexity. We can try:\n   - Seasonal models like SARIMA (with seasonality of 24) but with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be well estimated.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n But note: the data shows a clear daily cycle (with peaks during the day and troughs at night). We can try to decompose and then forecast.\n\n However, the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n Given the short history, we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) ahead.\n\n We choose a model: We'll use a seasonal naive approach as a baseline? But the problem requires a forecast and we can use a simple model that uses the average of the same hour in the past days.\n\n Approach 1: \n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data ends at 2017-09-17 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00.\n\n However, we see that the pattern might not be exactly the same every day? Let's look at the data:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-09-14): \n        HULL: [2.210, 2.076, 1.340, 1.340, 2.344, 0.804, 0.804, 0.938, 2.277, 1.474, 3.282, 5.224, 4.086, 4.890, 4.086, 2.277, 0.067, -0.670, -1.875, -1.674, -1.608, -1.206, -0.536, 0.670]\n   Day 2 (2017-09-15): \n        [1.808, 1.474, -0.402, 1.808, 0.536, 1.206, -0.067, 0.938, 1.005, 0.268, 0.469, 0.000, -0.603, 1.942, 1.273, 1.273, -1.139, -1.407, -2.076, -1.942, -1.407, -1.808, 0.536, 2.344]\n   Day 3 (2017-09-16): \n        [2.411, 2.076, 1.608, 2.210, 2.813, 2.545, 1.474, 1.741, 2.947, 2.813, 3.081, 5.224, 4.689, 5.090, 1.474, 1.875, 0.469, -0.804, -1.273, -0.670, -1.005, -1.808, 0.402, 1.407]\n   Day 4 (2017-09-17): \n        [1.875, 2.612, 1.674, 1.875, 1.808, 1.072, 0.871, 1.206, 1.474, 1.474, 3.885, 3.416, 3.684, 3.952, 3.416, 1.541, 0.402, -0.737, -1.407, -0.938, -0.871, -0.603, -0.402, 0.804]\n\n We can see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. However, we can compute the average for each hour across the 4 days.\n\n But note: the last day (2017-09-17) has a different pattern? It's a Sunday? (2017-09-14 is Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday). \n The next 4 days would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? So we might not have the same day of week.\n\n However, with only 4 days and no clear weekly pattern (because we don't have multiple weeks), we can only use the daily average.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   For hour 0: (2.210 + 1.808 + 2.411 + 1.875) / 4 = (2.210+1.808=4.018; 4.018+2.411=6.429; 6.429+1.875=8.304) -> 8.304/4 = 2.076\n   For hour 1: (2.076+1.474+2.076+2.612)/4 = (2.076+1.474=3.55; 3.55+2.076=5.626; 5.626+2.612=8.238) -> 8.238/4 = 2.0595 -> 2.060\n\n But note: the data has 3 decimal places? So we can round to 3 decimals.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. But given the constraints (only 4 days of history) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we might stick with the daily average.\n\n But let's check the last day (Sunday) might be different? We don't have a Monday to compare. So we have to use all the data.\n\n We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n However, note that the data for the same hour across days might be volatile. We can also consider using the median to be robust to outliers? But let's see:\n\n   For hour 0: [2.210, 1.808, 2.411, 1.875] -> sorted: [1.808, 1.875, 2.210, 2.411] -> median = (1.875+2.210)/2 = 2.0425 -> 2.043\n   But the average was 2.076.\n\n We have to choose one. Since the data does not have extreme outliers, we can use the average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n  0: (2.210 + 1.808 + 2.411 + 1.875) / 4 = 8.304 / 4 = 2.076\n  1: (2.076 + 1.474 + 2.076 + 2.612) / 4 = 8.238 / 4 = 2.0595 -> 2.060\n  2: (1.340 + (-0.402) + 1.608 + 1.674) / 4 = (1.340 -0.402 = 0.938; 0.938+1.608=2.546; 2.546+1.674=4.22) -> 4.22/4=1.055\n  3: (1.340 + 1.808 + 2.210 + 1.875) / 4 = (1.340+1.808=3.148; 3.148+2.210=5.358; 5.358+1.875=7.233) -> 7.233/4=1.80825 -> 1.808\n  4: (2.344 + 0.536 + 2.813 + 1.808) / 4 = (2.344+0.536=2.88; 2.88+2.813=5.693; 5.693+1.808=7.501) -> 7.501/4=1.87525 -> 1.875\n  5: (0.804 + 1.206 + 2.545 + 1.072) / 4 = (0.804+1.206=2.01; 2.01+2.545=4.555; 4.555+1.072=5.627) -> 5.627/4=1.40675 -> 1.407\n  6: (0.804 + (-0.067) + 1.474 + 0.871) / 4 = (0.804-0.067=0.737; 0.737+1.474=2.211; 2.211+0.871=3.082) -> 3.082/4=0.7705 -> 0.771\n  7: (0.938 + 0.938 + 1.741 + 1.206) / 4 = (0.938+0.938=1.876; 1.876+1.741=3.617; 3.617+1.206=4.823) -> 4.823/4=1.20575 -> 1.206\n  8: (2.277 + 1.005 + 2.947 + 1.474) / 4 = (2.277+1.005=3.282; 3.282+2.947=6.229; 6.229+1.474=7.703) -> 7.703/4=1.92575 -> 1.926\n  9: (1.474 + 0.268 + 2.813 + 1.474) / 4 = (1.474+0.268=1.742; 1.742+2.813=4.555; 4.555+1.474=6.029) -> 6.029/4=1.50725 -> 1.507\n  10: (3.282 + 0.469 + 3.081 + 3.885) / 4 = (3.282+0.469=3.751; 3.751+3.081=6.832; 6.832+3.885=10.717) -> 10.717/4=2.67925 -> 2.679\n  11: (5.224 + 0.000 + 5.224 + 3.416) / 4 = (5.224+0.000=5.224; 5.224+5.224=10.448; 10.448+3.416=13.864) -> 13.864/4=3.466\n  12: (4.086 + (-0.603) + 4.689 + 3.684) / 4 = (4.086-0.603=3.483; 3.483+4.689=8.172; 8.172+3.684=11.856) -> 11.856/4=2.964\n  13: (4.890 + 1.942 + 5.090 + 3.952) / 4 = (4.890+1.942=6.832; 6.832+5.090=11.922; 11.922+3.952=15.874) -> 15.874/4=3.9685 -> 3.969\n  14: (4.086 + 1.273 + 1.474 + 3.416) / 4 = (4.086+1.273=5.359; 5.359+1.474=6.833; 6.833+3.416=10.249) -> 10.249/4=2.56225 -> 2.562\n  15: (2.277 + 1.273 + 1.875 + 1.541) / 4 = (2.277+1.273=3.55; 3.55+1.875=5.425; 5.425+1.541=6.966) -> 6.966/4=1.7415 -> 1.742\n  16: (0.067 + (-1.139) + 0.469 + 0.402) / 4 = (0.067-1.139=-1.072; -1.072+0.469=-0.603; -0.603+0.402=-0.201) -> -0.201/4 = -0.05025 -> -0.050\n  17: (-0.670 + (-1.407) + (-0.804) + (-0.737)) / 4 = (-0.670-1.407=-2.077; -2.077-0.804=-2.881; -2.881-0.737=-3.618) -> -3.618/4 = -0.9045 -> -0.905\n  18: (-1.875 + (-2.076) + (-1.273) + (-1.407)) / 4 = (-1.875-2.076=-3.951; -3.951-1.273=-5.224; -5.224-1.407=-6.631) -> -6.631/4 = -1.65775 -> -1.658\n  19: (-1.674 + (-1.942) + (-0.670) + (-0.938)) / 4 = (-1.674-1.942=-3.616; -3.616-0.670=-4.286; -4.286-0.938=-5.224) -> -5.224/4 = -1.306\n  20: (-1.608 + (-1.407) + (-1.005) + (-0.871)) / 4 = (-1.608-1.407=-3.015; -3.015-1.005=-4.02; -4.02-0.871=-4.891) -> -4.891/4 = -1.22275 -> -1.223\n  21: (-1.206 + (-1.808) + (-1.808) + (-0.603)) / 4 = (-1.206-1.808=-3.014; -3.014-1.808=-4.822; -4.822-0.603=-5.425) -> -5.425/4 = -1.35625 -> -1.356\n  22: (-0.536 + 0.536 + 0.402 + (-0.402)) / 4 = (-0.536+0.536=0; 0+0.402=0.402; 0.402-0.402=0) -> 0/4=0.000\n  23: (0.670 + 2.344 + 1.407 + 0.804) / 4 = (0.670+2.344=3.014; 3.014+1.407=4.421; 4.421+0.804=5.225) -> 5.225/4=1.30625 -> 1.306\n\n So the average for each hour (0 to 23) is:\n  0: 2.076\n  1: 2.060\n  2: 1.055\n  3: 1.808\n  4: 1.875\n  5: 1.407\n  6: 0.771\n  7: 1.206\n  8: 1.926\n  9: 1.507\n  10: 2.679\n  11: 3.466\n  12: 2.964\n  13: 3.969\n  14: 2.562\n  15: 1.742\n  16: -0.050\n  17: -0.905\n  18: -1.658\n  19: -1.306\n  20: -1.223\n  21: -1.356\n  22: 0.000\n  23: 1.306\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-09-18): [2.076, 2.060, 1.055, 1.808, 1.875, 1.407, 0.771, 1.206, 1.926, 1.507, 2.679, 3.466, 2.964, 3.969, 2.562, 1.742, -0.050, -0.905, -1.658, -1.306, -1.223, -1.356, 0.000, 1.306]\n   Day 2 (2017-09-19): same 24 numbers\n   Day 3 (2017-09-20): same\n   Day 4 (2017-09-21): same\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough to capture it. Also, the average method might be too simplistic.\n\n However, given the data, we have no other information. We'll use this.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not told that the next 96 will have missing values? We are to provide the complete data. So we will output 96 numbers without missing values.\n\n We must generate the dates as well.\n\n The last date in the input is 2017-09-17 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n   2017-09-18 00:00:00\n   2017-09-18 01:00:00\n   ...\n   2017-09-18 23:00:00\n   2017-09-19 00:00:00\n   ...\n   2017-09-21 23:00:00\n\n We'll generate the dates and then assign the average values for the corresponding hour.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n   For i in range(96):\n        hour = i % 24\n        value = average[hour]\n\n   Then we assign the date starting from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 and increment by hour.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-09-18 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-09-18 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-18 23:00:00 -> 2017-09-19 00:00:00, etc.\n\n We'll create a list of dates and the corresponding HULL value.\n\n However, note: the input data has the date as index? We are to output in the same format.\n\n Format of the answer:\n\n    <answer>\n        date   HULL\n        2017-09-18 00:00:00  [value]\n        2017-09-18 01:00:00  [value]\n        ...\n        2017-09-21 23:00:00  [value]\n    </answer>\n\n We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll output the data as:\n\n        date                HULL\n        2017-09-18 00:00:00 2.076\n        2017-09-18 01:00:00 2.060\n        ... \n\n However, we computed the averages to 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n But note: the input data has 3 decimals? So we output 3 decimals.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-09-18\n        00:00:00 -> 2.076\n        01:00:00 -> 2.060\n        02:00:00 -> 1.055\n        03:00:00 -> 1.808\n        04:00:00 -> 1.875\n        05:00:00 -> 1.407\n        06:00:00 -> 0.771\n        07:00:00 -> 1.206\n        08:00:00 -> 1.926\n        09:00:00 -> 1.507\n        10:00:00 -> 2.679\n        11:00:00 -> 3.466\n        12:00:00 -> 2.964\n        13:00:00 -> 3.969\n        14:00:00 -> 2.562\n        15:00:00 -> 1.742\n        16:00:00 -> -0.050\n        17:00:00 -> -0.905\n        18:00:00 -> -1.658\n        19:00:00 -> -1.306\n        20:00:00 -> -1.223\n        21:00:00 -> -1.356\n        22:00:00 -> 0.000\n        23:00:00 -> 1.306\n\n   Day 2: 2017-09-19: same 24 numbers\n   Day 3: 2017-09-20: same\n   Day 4: 2017-09-21: same\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n However, note: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have enough history to capture weekly. So we use the same daily pattern for all days.\n\n This is a simple and reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's write the data.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You are an expert in time series forecasting\". We are using a simple method because of the very short history.\n\n If we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model (like SARIMA, Prophet, etc.). But with 4 days, we cannot.\n\n We output the data in the required format.\n\n Important: the date format is exactly as in the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-09-18 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n We can use Python's datetime and timedelta, but since we are writing by hand, we can do:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-09-18\n   Day 2: 2017-09-19\n   Day 3: 2017-09-20\n   Day 4: 2017-09-21\n\n And for each day, the 24 hours.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   for day in [18,19,20,21]:\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date = f\"2017-09-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n But note: the day must be two digits.\n\n However, 18,19,20,21 are two digits.\n\n But the month is 09 (September) and the days are 18,19,20,21.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n  2017-09-18 00:00:00\n  2017-09-18 01:00:00\n  ...\n  2017-09-18 23:00:00\n  2017-09-19 00:00:00\n  ...\n  2017-09-21 23:00:00\n\n We have 4*24=96 lines.\n\n We'll assign the HULL values by the hour of the day.\n\n Let's code the output.\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must output 96 lines.\n\n We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the input data had negative values and three decimal places. We output the same.\n\n We'll write:\n\n    <answer>\n        2017-09-18 00:00:00  2.076\n        2017-09-18 01:00:00  2.060\n        2017-09-18 02:00:00  1.055\n        2017-09-18 03:00:00  1.808\n        2017-09-18 04:00:00  1.875\n        2017-09-18 05:00:00  1.407\n        2017-09-18 06:00:00  0.771\n        2017-09-18 07:00:00  1.206\n        2017-09-18 08:00:00  1.926\n        2017-09-18 09:00:00  1.507\n        2017-09-18 10:00:00  2.679\n        2017-09-18 11:00:00  3.466\n        2017-09-18 12:00:00  2.964\n        2017-09-18 13:00:00  3.969\n        2017-09-18 14:00:00  2.562\n        2017-09-18 15:00:00  1.742\n        2017-09-18 16:00:00  -0.050\n        2017-09-18 17:00:00  -0.905\n        2017-09-18 18:00:00  -1.658\n        2017-09-18 19:00:00  -1.306\n        2017-09-18 20:00:00  -1.223\n        2017-09-18 21:00:00  -1.356\n        2017-09-18 22:00:00  0.000\n        2017-09-18 23:00:00  1.306\n\n        ... and then the same for the next 3 days? Actually, we have the same pattern for each day.\n\n        So for 2017-09-19 00:00:00: 2.076\n        and so on.\n\n We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we write all 96.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   dates = []\n   values = []\n\n   for day_offset in range(4): # 4 days\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date_str = (start_date + day_offset * 24 hours + hour hours) ... \n\n   We know the start date for the forecast is 2017-09-18 00:00:00.\n\n   We can generate:\n\n        day 0: 2017-09-18\n        day 1: 2017-09-19\n        day 2: 2017-09-20\n        day 3: 2017-09-21\n\n   And for each day, we output the 24 values in the order of the hour.\n\n   The hour index (0 to 23) corresponds to the average we computed.\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 average values in order.\n\n   avg = [2.076, 2.060, 1.055, 1.808, 1.875, 1.407, 0.771, 1.206, 1.926, 1.507, 2.679, 3.466, 2.964, 3.969, 2.562, 1.742, -0.050, -0.905, -1.658, -1.306, -1.223, -1.356, 0.000, 1.306]\n\n   Then for each of the 4 days, we output:\n\n        for i in [0,1,2,3]: # day index\n            for j in range(24): # hour index\n                date = f\"2017-09-{18+i} {j:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = avg[j]\n\n   But note: the day 18,19,20,21: \n        i=0 -> 18\n        i=1 -> 19\n        i=2 -> 20\n        i=3 -> 21\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the day 09 has 30 days? September has 30 days. So 18,19,20,21 are valid.\n\n   We write the day as two digits: 18, 19, 20, 21.\n\n   But note: the month is 09, so we write \"2017-09-18\", etc.\n\n   We'll generate the data.\n\n   We must output in the exact format: \n        \"2017-09-18 00:00:00  2.076\"\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        print(f\"{date}  {value:.3f} }\")   but we have to format the value to 3 decimals.\n\n   However, note: the value for hour 22 is 0.000 -> we output 0.000? But the input had negative and positive.\n\n   We'll format each value to 3 decimal places.\n\n   But note: the average for hour 16 is -0.050 -> we output -0.050.\n\n   We'll do: \n        value_str = f\"{value:.3f}\"\n\n   However, if the value is integer? we still output 0.000.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        for i in range(4): # days\n            for j in range(24):\n                day_str = str(18+i).zfill(2)   # but 18,19,20,21 are two digits, so no need to pad.\n                date_str = f\"2017-09-{18+i} {j:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = avg[j]\n                # Format the value to 3 decimal places\n                # If the value is integer, we still want 3 decimals? The input had 3 decimals.\n                # So we format to 3 decimals.\n                value_str = f\"{value:.3f}\"\n\n   But note: the value might be negative? and we want to keep the negative sign.\n\n   Example: -0.050 -> formatted to 3 decimals: it will be -0.050.\n\n   However, in Python formatting: \n        >>> f\"{-0.050:.3f}\"\n        '-0.050'\n\n   So it's fine.\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.

The input had:\n\n        \"2017-09-14 00:00:00  2.210\"\n\n   So we use a space.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        for each row: \n            f\"{date_str}  {value_str}\"\n\n   We use two spaces? The input had two spaces? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2017-09-14 00:00:00  2.210\" -> two spaces? Actually, in the example it was:\n\n        \"2017-09-14 00:00:00  2.210\" -> but in the text it's hard to see. We'll use one space.\n\n   But the example input had:\n\n        \"2017-09-14 00:00:00  2.210\" -> it has two spaces? Actually, in the markdown, it's two spaces? We'll use one space to separate.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact spacing. We'll use one space between the time and the value.\n\n   But note: the date string has a space between date and time: \"2017-09-14 00:00:00\", then we add a space and then the value.\n\n   So: \"2017-09-14 00:00:00 2.210\"\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n   We'll write the answer.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   We output 96 lines.\n\n   We do:\n\n        <answer>\n            2017-09-18 00:00:00 2.076\n            2017-09-18 01:00:00 2.060\n            ... \n        </answer>\n\n   We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the average for hour 2 is 1.055 -> that's 3 decimals.\n\n   We are confident.\n\n   Let's write the answer.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Please obey the format strictly\".
