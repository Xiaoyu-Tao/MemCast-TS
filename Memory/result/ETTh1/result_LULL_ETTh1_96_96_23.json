        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series structure with hourly frequency.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any (all hours are present). However, we are to be cautious.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to provide a complete set of 96 forecasted values, we must generate 96-step forecast.\n\n Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 points, we can use a simple time series method that can capture:\n   - Daily seasonality (since we see a pattern repeating every day, though not exactly)\n   - Possibly an autoregressive component.\n\n However, note that the data does not have a clear trend but does show intra-day variations.\n\n Given the constraints, we cannot use complex models that require long training, but we can try:\n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? (but with only 4 days, seasonality might be hard to capture robustly)\n   - Using a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) might be suitable.\n\n But note: we have only 4 days (96 points) and we want to forecast 4 days (96 points). This is a challenge.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an autoregressive model (like ARIMA) with seasonal component (SARIMA). However, with only 4 days, the seasonal period is 24 (for hourly data with daily seasonality). But 4 days is very short to fit a SARIMA model with 24 seasonal lags.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? That is, for hour 00:00, take the average of the 00:00 of the 4 days we have, and use that for the next 00:00, and so on.\n\n However, let's look at the data: the days are not exactly the same. For example, the first day (2016-10-01) at 00:00:00 is 0.883, the next day (2016-10-02) is 0.853, then 2016-10-03 is 1.310, and 2016-10-04 is 0.701. So the average for 00:00:00 would be (0.883+0.853+1.310+0.701)/4 = 0.93675.\n\n But note: the data for 2016-10-03 is quite different. Maybe we can use a median to be robust? Or we can use the last day (2016-10-04) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n   Method: Use a naive seasonal forecast: take the last day (2016-10-04) and use it as the forecast for the next day? But that would only give 24 hours. We need 4 days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the four days for each hour of the day to form a 24-hour profile and then repeat that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n   Steps:\n     - Group by hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the mean (or median) for that hour across the 4 days.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2016-10-05 to 2016-10-08), assign the corresponding hour's average.\n\n   Why this might be acceptable?\n     - It captures the daily pattern and averages out the day-to-day variations.\n\n   But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day 1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: average\n        Day 3: average\n        Day 4: average\n\n   We can compute:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-01: \n            mean = (0.883+0.944+0.914+1. + ... +0.914) -> let's not compute by hand, but we can note that the values are around 1.\n        Instead, we can compute the overall mean of the entire 96 points: \n            total = 0.883+0.944+0.883+0.883+0.883+0.914+1.005+1.005+1.340+1.249+1.310+1.218+1.127+1.097+1.188+1.188+1.188+1.097+1.097+0.975+0.761+0.883+0.822+0.914\n            +0.853+0.853+0.701+0.640+0.609+0.670+0.761+1.066+1.066+1.066+1.036+1.005+0.883+1.066+1.218+1.218+1.340+1.432+0.883+0.731+0.731+0.731+0.883+0.822\n            +1.310+1.371+1.279+1.310+1.371+1.340+1.340+1.767+1.218+1.218+1.066+0.975+0.944+1.005+1.127+0.944+0.944+0.670+0.701+0.640+0.609+0.640+0.609+0.731\n            +0.701+0.701+0.579+0.609+0.701+0.731+0.670+0.761+0.914+1.066+1.005+0.944+0.670+1.005+1.005+1.005+0.975+0.883+0.701+0.701+0.548+0.670+0.701+0.640\n\n        We can calculate the mean of the entire 96 points: \n            Let me do it step by step:\n\n            We can break it into 4 days:\n\n            Day1: 24 points: \n                [0.883,0.944,0.883,0.883,0.883,0.914,1.005,1.005,1.340,1.249,1.310,1.218,1.127,1.097,1.188,1.188,1.188,1.097,1.097,0.975,0.761,0.883,0.822,0.914]\n                Sum = 25.006\n\n            Day2: \n                [0.853,0.853,0.701,0.640,0.609,0.670,0.761,1.066,1.066,1.066,1.036,1.005,0.883,1.066,1.218,1.218,1.340,1.432,0.883,0.731,0.731,0.731,0.883,0.822]\n                Sum = 23.635\n\n            Day3:\n                [1.310,1.371,1.279,1.310,1.371,1.340,1.340,1.767,1.218,1.218,1.066,0.975,0.944,1.005,1.127,0.944,0.944,0.670,0.701,0.640,0.609,0.640,0.609,0.731]\n                Sum = 25.309\n\n            Day4:\n                [0.701,0.701,0.579,0.609,0.701,0.731,0.670,0.761,0.914,1.066,1.005,0.944,0.670,1.005,1.005,1.005,0.975,0.883,0.701,0.701,0.548,0.670,0.701,0.640]\n                Sum = 19.366\n\n            Total = 25.006 + 23.635 + 25.309 + 19.366 = 93.316\n            Mean per hour = 93.316 / 96 = 0.97225\n\n        Now, if we take the average by hour of the day over the 4 days, we get 24 values. The overall mean of these 24 values should be 0.97225.\n\n        But note: the last day (day4) has a lower average (19.366/24=0.8069) than the others. This might indicate a downward trend? Or just a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days.\n\n        However, without more data, it's hard to capture a trend. Therefore, we can either:\n          a) Use the average of the 4 days for each hour (ignoring trend) -> this will give a flat daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n          b) Try to adjust for the trend? But with only 4 days, it's risky.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide a complete set, we choose the average by hour.\n\n        Steps for average by hour:\n\n          We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00): \n            day1: 0.883, day2: 0.853, day3: 1.310, day4: 0.701 -> average = (0.883+0.853+1.310+0.701)/4 = 3.747/4 = 0.93675\n\n          Similarly for hour 1 (01:00): \n            day1: 0.944, day2: 0.853, day3: 1.371, day4: 0.701 -> (0.944+0.853+1.371+0.701)/4 = 3.869/4 = 0.96725\n\n          ... and so on.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days (2016-10-05 to 2016-10-08), we assign:\n          2016-10-05 00:00:00 -> 0.93675\n          2016-10-05 01:00:00 -> 0.96725\n          ... until 2016-10-05 23:00:00 (the 24th hour of the next day)\n          then 2016-10-06 00:00:00 -> 0.93675 (again) and so on.\n\n        This will give 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n        However, note: the data provided ends at 2016-10-04 23:00:00. The next 96 points start at 2016-10-05 00:00:00 and go to 2016-10-08 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n        We'll create a list of 24 values (the average for each hour of the day) and then repeat that list 4 times.\n\n        But note: the data might have some anomalies? For example, on day3 the values are higher. By taking the mean we smooth that out.\n\n        Alternatively, we could use the last day (day4) as the pattern and adjust it by the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n        Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only 4 days, the average by hour is a reasonable baseline.\n\n        Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        We'll index the hours from 0 to 23.\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): [0.883, 0.853, 1.310, 0.701] -> 0.93675\n        Hour 1 (01:00): [0.944, 0.853, 1.371, 0.701] -> 0.96725\n        Hour 2 (02:00): [0.883, 0.701, 1.279, 0.579] -> (0.883+0.701+1.279+0.579)/4 = 3.442/4 = 0.8605\n        Hour 3 (03:00): [0.883, 0.640, 1.310, 0.609] -> (0.883+0.640+1.310+0.609)/4 = 3.442/4 = 0.8605\n        Hour 4 (04:00): [0.883, 0.609, 1.371, 0.701] -> (0.883+0.609+1.371+0.701)/4 = 3.564/4 = 0.891\n        Hour 5 (05:00): [0.914, 0.670, 1.340, 0.731] -> (0.914+0.670+1.340+0.731)/4 = 3.655/4 = 0.91375\n        Hour 6 (06:00): [1.005, 0.761, 1.340, 0.670] -> (1.005+0.761+1.340+0.670)/4 = 3.776/4 = 0.944\n        Hour 7 (07:00): [1.005, 1.066, 1.767, 0.761] -> (1.005+1.066+1.767+0.761)/4 = 4.599/4 = 1.14975\n        Hour 8 (08:00): [1.340, 1.066, 1.218, 0.914] -> (1.340+1.066+1.218+0.914)/4 = 4.538/4 = 1.1345\n        Hour 9 (09:00): [1.249, 1.066, 1.218, 1.066] -> (1.249+1.066+1.218+1.066)/4 = 4.599/4 = 1.14975\n        Hour 10 (10:00): [1.310, 1.036, 1.066, 1.005] -> (1.310+1.036+1.066+1.005)/4 = 4.417/4 = 1.10425\n        Hour 11 (11:00): [1.218, 1.005, 0.975, 0.944] -> (1.218+1.005+0.975+0.944)/4 = 4.142/4 = 1.0355\n        Hour 12 (12:00): [1.127, 0.883, 0.944, 0.670] -> (1.127+0.883+0.944+0.670)/4 = 3.624/4 = 0.906\n        Hour 13 (13:00): [1.097, 1.066, 1.005, 1.005] -> (1.097+1.066+1.005+1.005)/4 = 4.173/4 = 1.04325\n        Hour 14 (14:00): [1.188, 1.218, 1.127, 1.005] -> (1.188+1.218+1.127+1.005)/4 = 4.538/4 = 1.1345\n        Hour 15 (15:00): [1.188, 1.218, 0.944, 1.005] -> (1.188+1.218+0.944+1.005)/4 = 4.355/4 = 1.08875\n        Hour 16 (16:00): [1.188, 1.340, 0.944, 0.975] -> (1.188+1.340+0.944+0.975)/4 = 4.447/4 = 1.11175\n        Hour 17 (17:00): [1.097, 1.432, 0.670, 0.883] -> (1.097+1.432+0.670+0.883)/4 = 4.082/4 = 1.0205\n        Hour 18 (18:00): [1.097, 0.883, 0.701, 0.701] -> (1.097+0.883+0.701+0.701)/4 = 3.382/4 = 0.8455\n        Hour 19 (19:00): [0.975, 0.731, 0.640, 0.701] -> (0.975+0.731+0.640+0.701)/4 = 3.047/4 = 0.76175\n        Hour 20 (20:00): [0.761, 0.731, 0.609, 0.548] -> (0.761+0.731+0.609+0.548)/4 = 2.649/4 = 0.66225\n        Hour 21 (21:00): [0.883, 0.731, 0.640, 0.670] -> (0.883+0.731+0.640+0.670)/4 = 2.924/4 = 0.731\n        Hour 22 (22:00): [0.822, 0.883, 0.609, 0.701] -> (0.822+0.883+0.609+0.701)/4 = 3.015/4 = 0.75375\n        Hour 23 (23:00): [0.914, 0.822, 0.731, 0.640] -> (0.914+0.822+0.731+0.640)/4 = 3.107/4 = 0.77675\n\n        Now, we have 24 values for the 0-23 hours.\n\n        Then, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n          Day 5: 2016-10-05 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.93675\n                  2016-10-05 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.96725\n                  ... until 2016-10-05 23:00:00 -> hour23: 0.77675\n\n          Day 6: 2016-10-06 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.93675\n                  ... and so on.\n\n        We do this for 4 days.\n\n        We must format the dates accordingly.\n\n        The last date in the given data is 2016-10-04 23:00:00.

But the problem does not specify.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        But note: the average of 0.883,0.853,1.310,0.701 is 0.93675 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 0.937.\n\n        However, let me check: 0.93675 rounded to 3 decimals: \n            The fourth decimal is 7, which is >=5, so we round up: 0.937.\n\n        Similarly, 0.96725 -> 0.967 (because 0.96725: the fourth decimal is 2, so we don't round up -> 0.967)\n\n        Actually, the rule: \n          Look at the fourth decimal: \n            if >=5, then add 1 to the third, else leave.\n\n        So:\n\n          0.93675 -> 0.937\n          0.96725 -> 0.967\n          0.8605 -> 0.861 (because 0.8605: the fourth decimal would be 5 -> round up: 0.861)\n\n        But note: 0.8605 is 0.8605 -> to 3 decimals: \n            The third decimal is 0, the fourth is 5 -> round up the third decimal: 0.861.\n\n        However, let me do it consistently.\n\n        We'll compute each average to 3 decimal places by rounding.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the exact value and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll recalc:\n\n          Hour0: 0.93675 -> 0.937\n          Hour1: 0.96725 -> 0.967\n          Hour2: 0.8605 -> 0.861\n          Hour3: 0.8605 -> 0.861\n          Hour4: 0.891 -> 0.891\n          But wait: 0.891 is already 3 decimals? Actually, 0.891 is 0.8910 -> so 0.891.\n\n          However, let me check: 0.891 is the same as 0.8910.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          Hour0: (0.883+0.853+1.310+0.701)/4 = 3.747/4 = 0.93675 -> round to 3 decimals: 0.937\n          Hour1: (0.944+0.853+1.371+0.701)/4 = 3.869/4 = 0.96725 -> 0.967\n          Hour2: (0.883+0.701+1.279+0.579)/4 = 3.442/4 = 0.8605 -> 0.861\n          Hour3: (0.883+0.640+1.310+0.609)/4 = 3.442/4 = 0.8605 -> 0.861\n          Hour4: (0.883+0.609+1.371+0.701)/4 = 3.564/4 = 0.891 -> 0.891\n          Hour5: (0.914+0.670+1.340+0.731)/4 = 3.655/4 = 0.91375 -> 0.914\n          Hour6: (1.005+0.761+1.340+0.670)/4 = 3.776/4 = 0.944 -> 0.944\n          Hour7: (1.005+1.066+1.767+0.761)/4 = 4.599/4 = 1.14975 -> 1.150\n          Hour8: (1.340+1.066+1.218+0.914)/4 = 4.538/4 = 1.1345 -> 1.135\n          Hour9: (1.249+1.066+1.218+1.066)/4 = 4.599/4 = 1.14975 -> 1.150\n          Hour10: (1.310+1.036+1.066+1.005)/4 = 4.417/4 = 1.10425 -> 1.104\n          Hour11: (1.218+1.005+0.975+0.944)/4 = 4.142/4 = 1.0355 -> 1.036\n          Hour12: (1.127+0.883+0.944+0.670)/4 = 3.624/4 = 0.906 -> 0.906\n          Hour13: (1.097+1.066+1.005+1.005)/4 = 4.173/4 = 1.04325 -> 1.043\n          Hour14: (1.188+1.218+1.127+1.005)/4 = 4.538/4 = 1.1345 -> 1.135\n          Hour15: (1.188+1.218+0.944+1.005)/4 = 4.355/4 = 1.08875 -> 1.089\n          Hour16: (1.188+1.340+0.944+0.975)/4 = 4.447/4 = 1.11175 -> 1.112\n          Hour17: (1.097+1.432+0.670+0.883)/4 = 4.082/4 = 1.0205 -> 1.021\n          Hour18: (1.097+0.883+0.701+0.701)/4 = 3.382/4 = 0.8455 -> 0.846\n          Hour19: (0.975+0.731+0.640+0.701)/4 = 3.047/4 = 0.76175 -> 0.762\n          Hour20: (0.761+0.731+0.609+0.548)/4 = 2.649/4 = 0.66225 -> 0.662\n          Hour21: (0.883+0.731+0.640+0.670)/4 = 2.924/4 = 0.731 -> 0.731\n          Hour22: (0.822+0.883+0.609+0.701)/4 = 3.015/4 = 0.75375 -> 0.754\n          Hour23: (0.914+0.822+0.731+0.640)/4 = 3.107/4 = 0.77675 -> 0.777\n\n        Now, we have 24 values for the day:\n\n          [0.937, 0.967, 0.861, 0.861, 0.891, 0.914, 0.944, 1.150, 1.135, 1.150, 1.104, 1.036, 0.906, 1.043, 1.135, 1.089, 1.112, 1.021, 0.846, 0.762, 0.662, 0.731, 0.754, 0.777]\n\n        Then we repeat this list 4 times for the 4 days.\n\n        We generate the dates:\n\n          Start: 2016-10-05 00:00:00\n          End: 2016-10-08 23:00:00\n\n        We can use pandas to generate the date range? But we are to output in a text format.\n\n        We'll generate:\n\n          date: from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00, hourly frequency.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Day 5: 2016-10-05, hours 0 to 23\n          Day 6: 2016-10-06, hours 0 to 23\n          Day 7: 2016-10-07, hours 0 to 23\n          Day 8: 2016-10-08, hours 0 to 23\n\n        We'll write 96 lines.\n\n        Format: \n          \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and then the LULL value (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n        Example first line: \"2016-10-05 00:00:00 0.937\"\n\n        We must output in the same structure as the input: two columns, with the date string and the value.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n            date  LULL\n            2016-10-05 00:00:00 0.937\n            2016-10-05 01:00:00 0.967\n            ...\n\n        We'll put it in the answer block.\n\n        Note: This method does not account for any trend, but with only 4 days of history, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n        If we had more data, we might use a more sophisticated model.\n\n        But the problem states: \"You are an expert in time series forecasting\" and we are to provide the complete data.\n\n        We'll go with this.\n\n        Let's code the 24 values:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            0.937, 0.967, 0.861, 0.861, 0.891, 0.914, 0.944, 1.150, \n            1.135, 1.150, 1.104, 1.036, 0.906, 1.043, 1.135, 1.089, \n            1.112, 1.021, 0.846, 0.762, 0.662, 0.731, 0.754, 0.777\n        ]\n\n        Then for i in range(0,4):\n            for j in range(0,24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=i, hours=j)\n\n        How to compute the start_date? The last date in the input is 2016-10-04 23:00:00, so the next date is 2016-10-05 00:00:00.\n\n        We can set: \n            start_date = datetime(2016,10,5,0,0,0)\n\n        Then:\n            day0: 2016-10-05 00:00:00 -> index0: 0.937\n            day0: 2016-10-05 01:00:00 -> index1: 0.967\n            ...\n            day0: 2016-10-05 23:00:00 -> index23: 0.777\n\n            day1: 2016-10-06 00:00:00 -> index0: 0.937\n            ... until day3: 2016-10-08 23:00:00 -> index23: 0.777\n\n        We'll generate the dates as strings in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n        We note that the input uses two-digit hours, etc.\n\n        We'll generate:\n\n          base_date = datetime(2016,10,5,0,0,0)\n          for i in range(96):\n              current_date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n              hour_of_day = i % 24\n              value = hourly_avg[hour_of_day]\n\n        Then output: current_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\") and the value.\n\n        But we are to output in the same format as the input: the date string and then the value (with 3 decimals).\n\n        We'll write:\n\n          2016-10-05 00:00:00 0.937\n          2016-10-05 01:00:00 0.967\n          ...\n\n        We'll do that.\n\n        However, note: the input has the date as index?
