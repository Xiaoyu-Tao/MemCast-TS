        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we have to handle the given data as is and then forecast.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 consecutive hourly timestamps starting from 2016-08-18 00:00:00.\n\n 3. Approach:\n    - We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, we might consider:\n        a) Seasonal decomposition: The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours). We can try to model the seasonality and trend.\n        b) Exponential smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n        c) ARIMA or SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA) which can model both non-seasonal and seasonal components.\n\n 4. However, note that we are only given 4 days of data. This is very limited for training a model with daily seasonality (which requires at least one full cycle). But we can try to capture the daily pattern.\n\n 5. Let's check the data pattern:\n    - Looking at the data, we see that the values fluctuate throughout the day. For example, on 2016-08-14, the values start at 1.188, go up to 1.706 (at 12:00) and then come down.\n    - The next day (2016-08-15) has a different pattern: it starts at 1.919 and then goes down and then up again? But note that the values are not exactly the same.\n\n 6. Given the limited data, we can try a simple approach: \n    - Use the average of each hour across the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that profile to forecast the next 4 days (since 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours).\n\n    Steps for the simple approach:\n      a) Group by hour of the day (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n      b) Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this daily profile.\n\n    But note: the data does not show a strong consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n      Example for hour 00:00:\n        2016-08-14 00:00:00: 1.188\n        2016-08-15 00:00:00: 1.919\n        2016-08-16 00:00:00: 1.371\n        2016-08-17 00:00:00: 1.218\n\n        Average = (1.188 + 1.919 + 1.371 + 1.218) / 4 = 1.424\n\n      Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n    c) Then, for the next 4 days (2016-08-18 to 2016-08-21), we assign the average value for each hour.\n\n 7. However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the level and then apply the seasonal component.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the last day (2016-08-17) as the base and then adjust by the average hourly profile? But again, we have limited data.\n\n 9. Considering the constraints, I will use the average hourly profile method.\n\n 10. Steps in code (if we were to code) but since we are to output, we can compute manually for each hour:\n\n      We have 24 hours. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n      Let me create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the 11. But note: the data starts at 2016-08-14 00:00:00 (which is hour0) and ends at 2016-08-17 23:00:00 (which is hour23 of the fourth day).\n\n      We have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n 12. Compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0 (00:00): [1.188, 1.919, 1.371, 1.218] -> (1.188+1.919+1.371+1.218)/4 = 5.696/4 = 1.424\n      hour1 (01:00): [1.188, 1.767, 1.157, 1.218] -> (1.188+1.767+1.157+1.218)/4 = 5.33/4 = 1.3325\n      hour2 (02:00): [1.218, 1.767, 1.127, 1.157] -> (1.218+1.767+1.127+1.157)/4 = 5.269/4 = 1.31725\n      hour3 (03:00): [1.157, 1.675, 1.097, 1.066] -> (1.157+1.675+1.097+1.066)/4 = 4.995/4 = 1.24875\n      hour4 (04:00): [1.371, 1.767, 1.066, 1.340] -> (1.371+1.767+1.066+1.340)/4 = 5.544/4 = 1.386\n      hour5 (05:00): [1.157, 1.767, 1.066, 1.127] -> (1.157+1.767+1.066+1.127)/4 = 5.117/4 = 1.27925\n      hour6 (06:00): [1.097, 1.797, 1.097, 1.218] -> (1.097+1.797+1.097+1.218)/4 = 5.209/4 = 1.30225\n      hour7 (07:00): [1.310, 2.132, 1.310, 0.853] -> (1.310+2.132+1.310+0.853)/4 = 5.605/4 = 1.40125\n      hour8 (08:00): [1.553, 1.462, 1.279, 1.249] -> (1.553+1.462+1.279+1.249)/4 = 5.543/4 = 1.38575\n      hour9 (09:00): [1.523, 1.371, 1.310, 1.432] -> (1.523+1.371+1.310+1.432)/4 = 5.636/4 = 1.409\n      hour10 (10:00): [1.553, 1.371, 1.553, 1.492] -> (1.553+1.371+1.553+1.492)/4 = 5.969/4 = 1.49225\n      hour11 (11:00): [1.492, 1.310, 1.492, 1.371] -> (1.492+1.310+1.492+1.371)/4 = 5.665/4 = 1.41625\n      hour12 (12:00): [1.706, 1.432, 1.432, 1.614] -> (1.706+1.432+1.432+1.614)/4 = 6.184/4 = 1.546\n      hour13 (13:00): [1.523, 1.432, 1.553, 1.614] -> (1.523+1.432+1.553+1.614)/4 = 6.122/4 = 1.5305\n      hour14 (14:00): [1.371, 1.401, 1.553, 1.645] -> (1.371+1.401+1.553+1.645)/4 = 5.97/4 = 1.4925\n      hour15 (15:00): [1.371, 1.492, 1.340, 1.645] -> (1.371+1.492+1.340+1.645)/4 = 5.848/4 = 1.462\n      hour16 (16:00): [1.645, 1.675, 1.462, 1.553] -> (1.645+1.675+1.462+1.553)/4 = 6.335/4 = 1.58375\n      hour17 (17:00): [1.432, 1.401, 1.340, 1.523] -> (1.432+1.401+1.340+1.523)/4 = 5.696/4 = 1.424\n      hour18 (18:00): [1.188, 1.401, 1.553, 1.492] -> (1.188+1.401+1.553+1.492)/4 = 5.634/4 = 1.4085\n      hour19 (19:00): [1.340, 1.371, 1.310, 1.340] -> (1.340+1.371+1.310+1.340)/4 = 5.361/4 = 1.34025\n      hour20 (20:00): [1.523, 1.492, 1.492, 1.492] -> (1.523+1.492+1.492+1.492)/4 = 5.999/4 = 1.49975\n      hour21 (21:00): [1.492, 1.371, 1.675, 1.736] -> (1.492+1.371+1.675+1.736)/4 = 6.274/4 = 1.5685\n      hour22 (22:00): [1.462, 1.340, 1.401, 1.553] -> (1.462+1.340+1.401+1.553)/4 = 5.756/4 = 1.439\n      hour23 (23:00): [1.371, 1.401, 1.279, 1.401] -> (1.371+1.401+1.279+1.401)/4 = 5.452/4 = 1.363\n\n 13. Now, we will use these hourly averages for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00). \n\n 14. Generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Day 1: 2016-08-18 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.424\n              2016-08-18 01:00:00 -> hour1: 1.3325\n              ... until 2016-08-18 23:00:00 -> hour23: 1.363\n\n      Day 2: 2016-08-19 00:00:00 -> hour0: 1.424\n              ... and so on.\n\n 15. We'll output the data in the same format: two columns (date and LULL) for 96 rows.\n\n 16. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 17. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: 1.424 -> 1.424\n        hour1: 1.3325 -> 1.333 (rounded to 3 decimals: 1.333)\n        hour2: 1.31725 -> 1.317\n        hour3: 1.24875 -> 1.249\n        hour4: 1.386 -> 1.386\n        hour5: 1.27925 -> 1.279\n        hour6: 1.30225 -> 1.302\n        hour7: 1.40125 -> 1.401\n        hour8: 1.38575 -> 1.386\n        hour9: 1.409 -> 1.409\n        hour10: 1.49225 -> 1.492\n        hour11: 1.41625 -> 1.416\n        hour12: 1.546 -> 1.546\n        hour13: 1.5305 -> 1.531\n        hour14: 1.4925 -> 1.493\n        hour15: 1.462 -> 1.462\n        hour16: 1.58375 -> 1.584\n        hour17: 1.424 -> 1.424\n        hour18: 1.4085 -> 1.409\n        hour19: 1.34025 -> 1.340\n        hour20: 1.49975 -> 1.500\n        hour21: 1.5685 -> 1.569\n        hour22: 1.439 -> 1.439\n        hour23: 1.363 -> 1.363\n\n 18. Now, we'll create the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2016-08-18 00:00:00\n      End: 2016-08-21 23:00:00\n\n 19. We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n 20. But note: the original data has the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. We'll generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 21. Let's generate:\n\n      Day 1: 2016-08-18\n        hour0: 2016-08-18 00:00:00, 1.424\n        hour1: 2016-08-18 01:00:00, 1.333\n        ... until hour23: 2016-08-18 23:00:00, 1.363\n\n      Day 2: 2016-08-19\n        hour0: 1.424\n        ... \n\n      Day 3: 2016-08-20\n      Day 4: 2016-08-21\n\n 22. We'll output 96 rows.\n\n 23. However, note: the original data index is given as a string? But in the output, we are to output the date as a string in the same way.\n\n 24. We must output the complete data without any omission.\n\n 25. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-18 00:00:00 1.424\n2016-08-18 01:00:00 1.333\n... (96 lines)\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 26. But note: the original data had the column name \"LULL\", but in the output we are just giving two columns without headers? The example input did not have headers in the data rows. So we output without headers.\n\n 27. Let's write the data.\n\n 28. However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 29. We'll generate the 96 rows.\n\n 30. We'll use the rounded values for each hour.\n\n 31. The hourly averages (rounded) for the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: 1.424\n        hour1: 1.333\n        hour2: 1.317\n        hour3: 1.249\n        hour4: 1.386\n        hour5: 1.279\n        hour6: 1.302\n        hour7: 1.401\n        hour8: 1.386\n        hour9: 1.409\n        hour10: 1.492\n        hour11: 1.416\n        hour12: 1.546\n        hour13: 1.531\n        hour14: 1.493\n        hour15: 1.462\n        hour16: 1.584\n        hour17: 1.424\n        hour18: 1.409\n        hour19: 1.340\n        hour20: 1.500\n        hour21: 1.569\n        hour22: 1.439\n        hour23: 1.363\n\n 32. Now, we write for 4 days: 2016-08-18, 2016-08-19, 2016-08-20, 2016-08-21.\n\n 33. We must be cautious: the next day after 2016-08-17 is 2016-08-18.\n\n 34. Let's generate the dates:\n\n      Day 1: 2016-08-18\n      Day 2: 2016-08-19\n      Day 3: 2016-08-20\n      Day 4: 2016-08-21\n\n 35. We'll write the data in the same format as the input (without the index numbers, just the date string and the value).\n\n 36. Example: \n        \"2016-08-18 00:00:00 1.424\"\n\n 37. We'll do this for 96 rows.\n\n 38. Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n 39. Note: We are to output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 40. We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-18 00:00:00 1.424\n2016-08-18 01:00:00 1.333\n2016-08-18 02:00:00 1.317\n2016-08-18 03:00:00 1.249\n2016-08-18 04:00:00 1.386\n2016-08-18 05:00:00 1.279\n2016-08-18 06:00:00 1.302\n2016-08-18 07:00:00 1.401\n2016-08-18 08:00:00 1.386\n2016-08-18 09:00:00 1.409\n2016-08-18 10:00:00 1.492\n2016-08-18 11:00:00 1.416\n2016-08-18 12:00:00 1.546\n2016-08-18 13:00:00 1.531\n2016-08-18 14:00:00 1.493\n2016-08-18 15:00:00 1.462\n2016-08-18 16:00:00 1.584\n2016-08-18 17:00:00 1.424\n2016-08-18 18:00:00 1.409\n2016-08-18 19:00:00 1.340\n2016-08-18 20:00:00 1.500\n2016-08-18 21:00:00 1.569\n2016-08-18 22:00:00 1.439\n2016-08-18 23:00:00 1.363\n2016-08-19 00:00:00 1.424\n2016-08-19 01:00:00 1.333\n...

We'll generate the dates programmatically in our mind: \n        Day1: 18 -> 19 -> 20 -> 21.\n\n 44. We output 4 full days.\n\n 45. Let's write the entire 96 rows.\n\n 46.
