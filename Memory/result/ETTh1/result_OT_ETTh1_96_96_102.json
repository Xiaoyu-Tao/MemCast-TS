        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00) for Oil Temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missingness in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We must choose a forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and we have hourly data with potential daily seasonality, we can consider:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because of the hourly pattern and possible daily seasonality (24 hours in a day).\n    - Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but given the small data (only 96 points) and the requirement for a complete forecast, a statistical method might be more straightforward.\n\n 3. However, note that we only have 96 points (4 days) to train on. This is a very short history. We must be cautious.\n\n 4. We observe the data: \n    - There is a clear daily pattern: temperatures drop during the night and rise during the day? But looking at the data, it's not very clear because we have only 4 days.\n    - There are some abrupt changes (like on 2017-08-16 06:00:00 and 07:00:00, the temperature drops to 11.467 and 10.552, then 9.356). This might be due to external factors.\n\n 5. Given the short history and the requirement to forecast 96 points (another 4 days), we can try to capture:\n    - Trend: We might not have enough for a long-term trend, but we can look for a daily pattern.\n    - Seasonality: We suspect a daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 6. We will use a simple method: \n    - Since the data is short, we can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, but that might be too simplistic.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet (which handles seasonality and missing data) or an ARIMA model with a seasonal component.\n\n 7. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values, so we can proceed.\n\n 8. Given the constraints (being an expert and having to provide a complete answer without omitting any content) and the fact that we are in a text-based environment without the ability to run code, \n    we must rely on a method that we can describe and then generate the forecast.\n\n 9. But note: the instruction says \"You must provide the complete data\" for the next 96 dates. We cannot run an actual model here, so we have to simulate a forecast.\n\n 10. Alternative approach: \n     Since we are to provide the data and we don't have a model to run, we can generate a forecast by:\n        a) Extending the last day's pattern? But the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n        b) Using a naive method: the last value repeated? That would be poor.\n\n 11. Given the complexity, we might have to use a simple average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n     We can compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of that hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps for this method:\n        - We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n        - We group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and take the average for that hour.\n\n     However, note that the data does not start at the beginning of a day? Actually, it starts at 2017-08-13 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-08-16 23:00:00, so exactly 4 days.\n\n     We can create a table for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [14.843, 15.054, 14.703, 16.250] -> average?\n        But let's do it properly.\n\n     But note: the data for the same hour might vary. Also, we see a drop on the last day? So maybe we should consider the last day as an outlier?\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-16) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that would be repeating the same day. However, the problem does not to omit any content and we must provide 96 points.\n\n 13. Considering the above, we decide to use the average by hour of the four days. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out some of the noise.\n\n     How to compute:\n        For hour h (0..23), we have 4 values: from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days at hour h will be the average of the 4 days for that hour.\n\n     But note: the next 4 days? Actually, we are forecasting the next 96 hours (4 days). So we will have 4 days of 24 hours.\n\n     We will create a list of 24 values (the average for each hour) and then repeat that list 4 times? But that would be the same pattern for each day.\n\n     However, we see that the pattern changes over the 4 days? Maybe due to a trend? We don't have enough to capture a trend.\n\n 14. We can also to adjust for a linear trend? But with 4 points per hour, we can't really. So we'll stick to the average.\n\n 15. Steps:\n\n     Let's extract the data by hour:\n\n        hour 0: [14.843, 15.054, 14.703, 16.250] -> average = (14.843+15.054+14.703+16.250)/4 = 15.2125\n        hour 1: [14.914, 15.336, 14.562, 16.250] -> (14.914+15.336+14.562+16.250)/4 = 15.2655\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00), we assign:\n        Day1 (2017-08-17): hour0: 15.2125, hour1: 15.2655, ... hour23: (average of hour23 of the 4 days)\n        Day2 (2017-08-18): same as day1? Actually, we are using the same 24 averages for each day.\n\n     But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning the next 96 hours. So we are going to have 4 days, each with 24 hours.\n\n     We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 16. However, we must be cautious: the last provided date is 2017-08-16 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2017-08-17 00:00:00\n        2017-08-17 01:00:00\n        ...\n        up to\n        2017-08-20 23:00:00\n\n 17. How to handle the fact that the average might not be the best? We are not accounting for any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n 18. We'll proceed with the average method for simplicity and because we have to provide an answer.\n\n 19. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n     We have 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-13 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day2: 2017-08-14 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day3: 2017-08-15 (index 48 to 71)\n        Day4: 2017-08-16 (index 72 to 95)\n\n     We can group by the hour of the day.\n\n 20. We'll compute:\n\n        hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72 -> [14.843, 15.054, 14.703, 16.250] -> 15.2125\n        hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73 -> [14.914, 15.336, 14.562, 16.250] -> 15.2655\n        hour2: indices 2, 50, 74 -> Wait, note: \n            Actually, index2: 2017-08-13 02:00:00 -> 15.054\n            index26: 2017-08-14 02:00:00 -> 15.265 (but wait, 2017-08-14 02:00:00 is index 26? Let me count: \n        Correction: \n            Day1: 0-23: 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n            Day2: 24-47: 2017-08-14 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> so 2017-08-14 02:00:00 is index 26? Actually, index0: 2017-08-13 00:00:00, index1: 01:00:00, index2: 02:00:00 -> so for 2017-08-14 02:00:00 is 24+2=26? \n        But we are grouping by the hour of the day, so we want the hour component.\n\n        Actually, we can ignore the index and just take every 24th point starting at the hour offset.\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour:\n\n            hour0: [data[0], data[24], data[48], data[72]]\n            hour1: [data[1], data[25], data[49], data[73]]\n            ... \n            hour23: [data[23], data[47], data[71], data[95]]\n\n 21. Then we compute the average for each hour.\n\n 22. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        We start at 2017-08-17 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-08-16 23:00:00) and go for 96 hours.\n\n        The forecast for:\n            2017-08-17 00:00:00 -> average of hour0\n            2017-08-17 01:00:00 -> average of hour1\n            ...\n            2017-08-17 23:00:00 -> average of hour23\n\n        Then 2017-08-18 00:00:00 -> average of hour0\n        ... until 2017-08-20 23:00:00 -> average of hour23\n\n 23. We must be cautious: the data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 24. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [14.843, 15.054, 14.703, 16.250] -> (14.843+15.054+14.703+16.250) = 60.85 -> 60.85/4 = 15.2125 -> 15.213 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        hour1: [14.914, 15.336, 14.562, 16.250] -> (14.914+15.336+14.562+16.250) = 61.062 -> 61.062/4 = 15.2655 -> 15.266\n        hour2: [15.054, 15.265, 14.773, 15.969] -> (15.054+15.265+14.773+15.969) = 61.061 -> 15.26525 -> 15.265\n        hour3: [15.265, 15.406, 14.703, 16.391] -> (15.265+15.406+14.703+16.391) = 61.765 -> 15.44125 -> 15.441\n        hour4: [15.054, 15.336, 14.421, 16.039] -> (15.054+15.336+14.421+16.039) = 60.85 -> 15.2125 -> 15.213\n        hour5: [15.406, 14.773, 14.491, 16.250] -> (15.406+14.773+14.491+16.250) = 60.92 -> 15.230\n        hour6: [15.617, 15.336, 14.351, 11.467] -> (15.617+15.336+14.351+11.467) = 56.771 -> 14.19275 -> 14.193\n        hour7: [14.914, 15.406, 14.421, 10.552] -> (14.914+15.406+14.421+10.552) = 55.293 -> 13.82325 -> 13.823\n        hour8: [12.029, 15.687, 14.984, 9.356] -> (12.029+15.687+14.984+9.356) = 52.056 -> 13.014\n        hour9: [14.914, 15.476, 15.476, 10.833] -> (14.914+15.476+15.476+10.833) = 56.699 -> 14.17475 -> 14.175\n        hour10: [13.085, 15.687, 15.969, 12.451] -> (13.085+15.687+15.969+12.451) = 57.192 -> 14.298\n        hour11: [13.366, 16.250, 15.336, 14.491] -> (13.366+16.250+15.336+14.491) = 59.443 -> 14.86075 -> 14.861\n        hour12: [14.843, 16.532, 15.758, 14.491] -> (14.843+16.532+15.758+14.491) = 61.624 -> 15.406\n        hour13: [14.491, 16.109, 16.743, 14.773] -> (14.491+16.109+16.743+14.773) = 62.116 -> 15.529\n        hour14: [15.476, 15.898, 17.798, 16.461] -> (15.476+15.898+17.798+16.461) = 65.633 -> 16.40825 -> 16.408\n        hour15: [15.898, 14.140, 18.009, 17.235] -> (15.898+14.140+18.009+17.235) = 65.282 -> 16.3205 -> 16.321\n        hour16: [15.547, 15.265, 18.501, 18.572] -> (15.547+15.265+18.501+18.572) = 67.885 -> 16.97125 -> 16.971\n        hour17: [15.617, 11.818, 18.712, 17.305] -> (15.617+11.818+18.712+17.305) = 63.452 -> 15.863\n        hour18: [15.758, 11.467, 17.657, 16.109] -> (15.758+11.467+17.657+16.109) = 60.991 -> 15.24775 -> 15.248\n        hour19: [15.125, 12.029, 16.461, 15.336] -> (15.125+12.029+16.461+15.336) = 58.951 -> 14.73775 -> 14.738\n        hour20: [14.491, 14.280, 16.391, 14.984] -> (14.491+14.280+16.391+14.984) = 60.146 -> 15.0365 -> 15.037\n        hour21: [12.381, 14.703, 16.321, 14.351] -> (12.381+14.703+16.321+14.351) = 57.756 -> 14.439\n        hour22: [14.280, 14.843, 16.250, 14.773] -> (14.280+14.843+16.250+14.773) = 60.146 -> 15.0365 -> 15.037\n        But wait, the last day (2017-08-16) at 22:00:00 is 14.773? Actually, the last day has:\n            2017-08-16 22:00:00 -> 14.773000 -> that's the last day's hour22? \n        Let me check: \n            Day1: 2017-08-13 22:00:00 -> 14.280\n            Day2: 2017-08-14 22:00:00 -> 14.843\n            Day3: 2017-08-15 22:00:00 -> 16.250\n            But wait, 2017-08-15 22:00:00 is 16.250? Actually, the data for 2017-08-15 22:00:00 is 16.250000? \n            The data: \n                2017-08-15 20:00:00 16.391001\n                2017-08-15 21:00:00 16.320999\n                2017-08-15 22:00:00 16.250000\n                2017-08-15 23:00:00 16.180000\n            So yes, 16.250.\n\n        Then hour22: [14.280, 14.843, 16.250, 14.773] -> average = (14.280+14.843+16.250+14.773)/4 = 60.146/4 = 15.0365 -> 15.037\n\n        hour23: [14.984, 14.773, 16.180, 14.773] -> (14.984+14.773+16.180+14.773) = 60.71 -> 15.1775 -> 15.178\n\n 25. Now, we create the forecast for the next 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-17\n            hour0: 15.213\n            hour1: 15.266\n            hour2: 15.265\n            hour3: 15.441\n            hour4: 15.213\n            hour5: 15.230\n            hour6: 14.193\n            hour7: 13.823\n            hour8: 13.014\n            hour9: 14.175\n            hour10: 14.298\n            hour11: 14.861\n            hour12: 15.406\n            hour13: 15.529\n            hour14: 16.408\n            hour15: 16.321\n            hour16: 16.971\n            hour17: 15.863\n            hour18: 15.248\n            hour19: 14.738\n            hour20: 15.037\n            hour21: 14.439\n            hour22: 15.037\n            hour23: 15.178\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 26. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not missing in the input, but the forecast we are generating is complete.\n\n 27. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 28. We must generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-17 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-17 01:00:00 ... until 2017-08-20 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 30.

We note that the last day (2017-08-20) hour23 is the same as the first day's hour23? Actually, we are repeating the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n 32. Let's write the first day:\n\n        2017-08-17 00:00:00 15.213\n        2017-08-17 01:00:00 15.266\n        2017-08-17 02:00:00 15.265\n        2017-08-17 03:00:00 15.441\n        2017-08-17 04:00:00 15.213\n        2017-08-17 05:00:00 15.230\n        2017-08-17 06:00:00 14.193\n        2017-08-17 07:00:00 13.823\n        2017-08-17 08:00:00 13.014\n        2017-08-17 09:00:00 14.175\n        2017-08-17 10:00:00 14.298\n        2017-08-17 11:00:00 14.861\n        2017-08-17 12:00:00 15.406\n        2017-08-17 13:00:00 15.529\n        2017-08-17 14:00:00 16.408\n        2017-08-17 15:00:00 16.321\n        2017-08-17 16:00:00 16.971\n        2017-08-17 17:00:00 15.863\n        2017-08-17 18:00:00 15.248\n        2017-08-17 19:00:00 14.738\n        2017-08-17 20:00:00 15.037\n        2017-08-17 21:00:00 14.439\n        2017-08-17 22:00:00 15.037\n        2017-08-17 23:00:00 15.178\n\n        Then the next day (2017-08-18) same values:\n\n        2017-08-18 00:00:00 15.213\n        ... and so on.\n\n 33. We'll generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 34. We note: the dates must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 35. We'll write the answer accordingly.\n\n 36. However, note that the input data has 3 decimal places. We are rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n 37. Let's code the output.\n\n 38. But note: we are not omit any content, so we must write all 96 lines.\n\n 39. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 40. We do not have any missing values in the forecast because we are providing the average for each hour.\n\n 41.
