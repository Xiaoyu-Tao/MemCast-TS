        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (4 days) of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily seasonality (24 hours). We might also consider weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not apparent.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality), or even a simple seasonal naive if the pattern is very stable.\n\n 4. Let's observe the data:\n    - The data shows a clear daily pattern: \n        * Lower values during the night (around 1.5 to 2.5) \n        * Higher values during the day (peaks around 5.5 in the first day, then around 3-4 in the following days) \n        * But note: the first day (2017-03-06) has a peak of 5.574 at 7:00, but the next days have lower peaks (around 3.32, 2.985, etc.). \n        * This might be a weekly pattern (Monday vs other weekdays) or a decreasing trend? However, we only have 4 days (Monday to Thursday). \n\n 5. Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can try to capture the daily seasonality.\n\n 6. We can use a seasonal decomposition to see the trend and seasonality, but with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Calculate the average pattern for a day from the available 4 days? But note: the first day (Monday) seems different. \n    - We have:\n        Day1: Monday\n        Day2: Tuesday\n        Day3: Wednesday\n        Day4: Thursday\n\n    - We are for the next week? Actually, the next 96 hours would be:\n        2017-03-10 (Friday), 2017-03-11 (Saturday), 2017-03-12 (Sunday), 2017-03-13 (Monday)\n\n    - So we have a weekend and then a Monday.\n\n 8. Since we don't have weekend data in the history, we cannot directly use the same daily pattern. We must be cautious.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the limited data, we can use a model that automatically captures seasonality and short-term dependencies.\n\n 10. We choose to use a simple model: Seasonal Naive. \n      - For each hour in the day, we take the average of the same hour from the last 4 days? \n      - But the pattern might change on weekends.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality, or an ARIMA model with seasonal components.\n\n 12. However, note: we are required to provide the complete data for the next 96 points. We must not omit any.\n\n 13. We'll use a model that can be fit on 96 points and forecast 96 points. We choose SARIMA.\n\n 14. Steps for SARIMA:\n      - We have seasonality of 24 hours (so seasonal period s=24).\n      - We have only 4 days (96 points) so we cannot use a very complex model.\n\n 15. We can try a simple SARIMA model: (0,0,0) x (0,1,0)[24] -> but that would be a seasonal random walk. \n      - Alternatively, we can use (0,1,1) x (0,1,1)[24] but that might be too complex for 4 days.\n\n 16. Given the small data, we can use a simple approach: \n      - We take the last week same day? But we don't have a full week. We have only 4 days.\n\n 17. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the available days for the next days? \n      - For Friday: we don't have Friday in history -> so we can use the average of the last 4 days? \n      - But the weekend might be different.\n\n 18. Since we don't have weekend data, we might assume that the pattern for Friday is similar to the average of Monday-Thursday? \n      - Then Saturday and Sunday might be similar to the average of the same hour of the weekdays? But that might not hold.\n\n 19. Given the constraints, we decide to use a simple moving average of the same hour over the last 4 days for the next day. \n      - For the first forecast day (Friday, 2017-03-10), we use the average of the same hour from Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n      - For Saturday, we use the same: average of the same hour from Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and ... we don't have Friday? \n        But we are forecasting sequentially? We are forecasting 96 points at once.\n\n 20. We can do:\n      - For the first 24 hours (Friday): use the average of the 4 previous same hours (i.e., hour0: average of the 4 previous hour0, etc.)\n      - For Saturday: we don't have Friday in history, so we use the same 4 days? But that would be the same as Friday? \n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour from the last 4 days (which are Monday to Thursday) for all the 4 days? \n        That would be the simplest.\n\n 21. However, note that the weekend might have a different pattern. But without data, we cannot adjust. \n\n 22. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 23. Steps:\n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days we have.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign for each hour the computed average.\n\n 24. But let's check: the data shows a decreasing trend? \n        Day1: Monday: max=5.574\n        Day2: Tuesday: max=3.32\n        Day3: Wednesday: max=3.32? (actually 3.32 on day2, then 2.985 on day3, and day4: 2.863? at 11:00 but then 2.985 at 7:00 on day3 and 2.863 at 11:00 on day4? \n        Actually, the peak on day4 (Thursday) was 2.985 at 7:00? and then 2.863 at 11:00? \n        So the peaks: 5.574, 3.32, 2.985, 2.863 -> decreasing.\n\n 25. If we use the average, we are ignoring the trend. \n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? \n      - For example, for Friday, we take the average of the same hour from the last 4 days, but with weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] for [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday] respectively.\n\n 27. But without knowing the future, and given the task, we can try to capture the trend by using a linear extrapolation for the same hour? \n      - For each hour, we fit a linear regression over the 4 points (one per day) and then predict the next 4 days? \n      - However, that would be 4 linear models (one per hour) and we have only 4 points per model -> overfitting and unstable.\n\n 28. Given the challenges, we decide to use the average per hour without trend adjustment. \n\n 29. We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n 30. Then, we generate the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the same 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n 31. Steps to compute the average for hour h:\n        avg_h = 0] = (4.112 + 1.797 + 2.071 + 1.888) / 4\n        ... and so on.\n\n 32. But note: the data we have 4 days? \n        Day1: 2017-03-06 (Monday) -> 24\n        Day2: 2017-03-07 (Tuesday) -> 24\n        Day3: 2017-03-08 (Wednesday) -> 24\n        Day4: 2017-03-09 (Thursday) -> 24\n\n 33. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average.\n\n 34. Then the forecast for:\n        Friday: 2017-03-10 00:00:00 -> avg_0\n        Friday: 2017-03-10 01:00:00 -> avg_1\n        ... \n        Monday: 2017-03-13 23:00:00 -> avg_23\n\n 35. However, note that the weekend might be different. But without data, we cannot adjust. \n\n 36. We'll proceed with the average.\n\n 37. Let's compute the averages:\n\n    hour0: [4.112, 1.797, 2.071, 1.888] -> (4.112+1.797+2.071+1.888)/4 = 9.868/4 = 2.467\n    hour1: [3.716, 1.706, 1.523, 1.888] -> (3.716+1.706+1.523+1.888)/4 = 8.833/4 = 2.20825\n    hour2: [4.477, 1.462, 1.614, 1.675] -> (4.477+1.462+1.614+1.675)/4 = 9.228/4 = 2.307\n    hour3: [4.173, 1.401, 1.767, 1.797] -> (4.173+1.401+1.767+1.797)/4 = 9.138/4 = 2.2845\n    hour4: [4.203, 1.492, 1.919, 1.888] -> (4.203+1.492+1.919+1.888)/4 = 9.502/4 = 2.3755\n    hour5: [4.264, 2.041, 2.102, 1.980] -> (4.264+2.041+2.102+1.980)/4 = 10.387/4 = 2.59675\n    hour6: [4.782, 2.376, 2.528, 2.437] -> (4.782+2.376+2.528+2.437)/4 = 12.123/4 = 3.03075\n    hour7: [5.574, 3.107, 3.320, 2.985] -> (5.574+3.107+3.320+2.985)/4 = 14.986/4 = 3.7465\n    hour8: [3.198, 2.772, 3.015, 2.833] -> (3.198+2.772+3.015+2.833)/4 = 11.818/4 = 2.9545\n    hour9: [2.955, 2.528, 2.589, 2.376] -> (2.955+2.528+2.589+2.376)/4 = 10.448/4 = 2.612\n    hour10: [2.955, 2.589, 3.259, 2.437] -> (2.955+2.589+3.259+2.437)/4 = 11.24/4 = 2.81\n    hour11: [3.076, 2.955, 3.015, 2.863] -> (3.076+2.955+3.015+2.863)/4 = 11.909/4 = 2.97725\n    hour12: [2.224, 2.163, 2.193, 2.041] -> (2.224+2.163+2.193+2.041)/4 = 8.621/4 = 2.15525\n    hour13: [2.163, 2.315, 2.559, 2.376] -> (2.163+2.315+2.559+2.376)/4 = 9.413/4 = 2.35325\n    hour14: [2.224, 2.437, 2.102, 2.193] -> (2.224+2.437+2.102+2.193)/4 = 8.956/4 = 2.239\n    hour15: [2.224, 2.437, 2.102, 2.376] -> (2.224+2.437+2.102+2.376)/4 = 9.139/4 = 2.28475\n    hour16: [2.376, 2.315, 2.315, 2.132] -> (2.376+2.315+2.315+2.132)/4 = 9.138/4 = 2.2845\n    hour17: [3.046, 2.741, 2.711, 2.589] -> (3.046+2.741+2.711+2.589)/4 = 11.087/4 = 2.77175\n    hour18: [2.650, 2.680, 2.467, 2.315] -> (2.650+2.680+2.467+2.315)/4 = 10.112/4 = 2.528\n    hour19: [2.863, 2.863, 2.680, 2.802] -> (2.863+2.863+2.680+2.802)/4 = 11.208/4 = 2.802\n    hour20: [2.772, 2.589, 2.376, 2.863] -> (2.772+2.589+2.376+2.863)/4 = 10.6/4 = 2.65\n    hour21: [2.376, 2.193, 2.224, 2.315] -> (2.376+2.193+2.224+2.315)/4 = 9.108/4 = 2.277\n    hour22: [1.919, 1.980, 2.132, 2.254] -> (1.919+1.980+2.132+2.254)/4 = 8.285/4 = 2.07125\n    hour23: [1.888, 2.071, 2.010, 1.828] -> (1.888+2.071+2.010+1.828)/4 = 7.797/4 = 1.94925\n\n 38. Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 39. The dates will be:\n        Start: 2017-03-10 00:00:00 (Friday)\n        Then 2017-03-10 01:00:00 ... until 2017-03-13 23:00:00 (Monday)\n\n 40. We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'LUFL'\n\n 41. We must not omit any content, so we output 96 lines.\n\n 42. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-10 00:00:00 2.467\n2017-03-10 01:00:00 2.20825\n...\n2017-03-13 23:00:00 1.94925\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 43. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 44. We round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 45. Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: round(2.467, 3) -> 2.467\n        hour1: 2.20825 -> 2.208\n        hour2: 2.307 -> 2.307\n        hour3: 2.2845 -> 2.285\n        hour4: 2.3755 -> 2.376\n        hour5: 2.59675 -> 2.597\n        hour6: 3.03075 -> 3.031\n        hour7: 3.7465 -> 3.747\n        hour8: 2.9545 -> 2.955\n        hour9: 2.612 -> 2.612\n        hour10: 2.81 -> 2.810\n        hour11: 2.97725 -> 2.977\n        hour12: 2.15525 -> 2.155\n        hour13: 2.35325 -> 2.353\n        hour14: 2.239 -> 2.239\n        hour15: 2.28475 -> 2.285\n        hour16: 2.2845 -> 2.285\n        hour17: 2.77175 -> 2.772\n        hour18: 2.528 -> 2.528\n        hour19: 2.802 -> 2.802\n        hour20: 2.65 -> 2.650\n        hour21: 2.277 -> 2.277\n        hour22: 2.07125 -> 2.071\n        hour23: 1.94925 -> 1.949\n\n 46. Now, we write the next 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2017-03-10 (Friday): hours 0 to 23 -> [2.467, 2.208, 2.307, 1.949]\n        Day2: 2017-03-11 (Saturday): same pattern: [2.467, 2.208, ...]\n        Day3: 2017-03-12 (Sunday): same pattern\n        Day4: 2017-03-13 (Monday): same pattern\n\n 47. But note: the pattern for the next Monday (2017-03-13) is the same as the previous Monday? \n        However, we are using the average of the 4 days, so it's a fixed pattern.\n\n 48. We output the dates and the corresponding value for the hour.\n\n 49. We generate the dates:\n\n        from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00, hourly.\n\n 50. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 51. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        start = '2017-03-10 00:00:00'\n        end = '2017-03-13 23:00:00'\n        date_range = pd.date_range(start=start, end=end, freq='H')\n\n        Then we have 96 dates.\n\n 52. But we are writing manually? We can do:\n\n        Day1: 2017-03-10 00:00:00 -> hour0: 2.467\n        Day1: 2017-03-10 01:00:00 -> hour1: 2.208\n        ...\n        Day1: 2017-03-10 23:00:00 -> hour23: 1.949\n\n        Day2: 2017-03-11 00:00:00 -> hour0: 2.467\n        ... and so on.\n\n 53. So the pattern repeats every 24 hours.\n\n 54. We write the 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 55. We note that the rounding might cause slight changes, but we have rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 56. Let's write the data:\n\n        We'll write 4 blocks of 24 lines, each block having the same 24 values.\n\n 57. We output:\n\n        2017-03-10 00:00:00 2.467\n        2017-03-10 01:00:00 2.208\n        2017-03-10 02:00:00 2.307\n        2017-03-10 03:00:00 2.285\n        2017-03-10 04:00:00 2.376\n        2017-03-10 05:00:00 2.597\n        2017-03-10 06:00:00 3.031\n        2017-03-10 07:00:00 3.747\n        2017-03-10 08:00:00 2.955\n        2017-03-10 09:00:00 2.612\n        2017-03-10 10:00:00 2.810\n        2017-03-10 11:00:00 2.977\n        2017-03-10 12:00:00 2.155\n        2017-03-10 13:00:00 2.353\n        2017-03-10 14:00:00 2.239\n        2017-03-10 15:00:00 2.285\n        2017-03-10 16:00:00 2.285\n        2017-03-10 17:00:00 2.772\n        2017-03-10 18:00:00 2.528\n        2017-03-10 19:00:00 2.802\n        2017-03-10 20:00:00 2.650\n        2017-03-10 21:00:00 2.277\n        2017-03-10 22:00:00 2.071\n        2017-03-10 23:00:00 1.949\n\n        Then for 2017-03-11 (Saturday) we repeat the same 24 numbers.\n\n        And similarly for 2017-03-12 and 2017-03-13.\n\n 58. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 59. Note: This is a simple method. In practice, one might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints (only 4 days) and the requirement for 96 points, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 60. We output the answer in the required format.\n",
