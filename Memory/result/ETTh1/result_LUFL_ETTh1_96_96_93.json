        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low Useful Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The data ranges from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n Since the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)\n   - Possibly weekly seasonality (but we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality from the data)\n\n However, note that the data might have missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Preprocess the data: The given data is complete, so we can use it as is.\n 2. We'll use a model that can handle multiple seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we can only model daily seasonality (period=24).\n 3. Given the small data size, we can use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, or a model that can extrapolate trends and seasonality.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data is at hourly frequency, we can use:\n   - SARIMA (with daily seasonality, i.e., seasonal period=24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality\n   - Or a simple method: use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But note we only have 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that might be changing. We see a drop in the last day (July 11) during the day, but then a peak at night.\n\n Considering the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a model that can capture the daily pattern and a trend.\n\n Approach:\n   We'll use a SARIMA model. We'll try to find the best parameters by using auto_arima or by analyzing the ACF and PACF, but we are limited by the data.\n\n However, note: the data is only 96 points. We can try a simple model: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1,24) or let auto_arima choose.\n\n But since we are to provide a complete forecast and the problem does not require showing the model building, we can use an automated method.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal forecast: using the last day (July 11) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be too naive and we have 4 days of history.\n\n Another idea: use the average of each hour over the 4 days we have.\n\n However, let's look at the data: \n   The first day (July 8): LUFL values at 20:00 is 4.538, then July 9: 2.802, July 10: 3.411, July 11: 4.386.\n   The pattern is not stable? \n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use a model that can capture the seasonality and a possible trend. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels with additive trend and additive seasonality of period 24.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   model = ExponentialSmoothing(data, trend='add', seasonal='add', seasonal_periods=24)\n   model_fit = model.fit()\n   forecast = model_fit.forecast(96)\n\n But note: we are not coding, we are to provide the forecasted values.\n\n However, we are to provide the next 96 points. We must generate the dates and the LUFL values.\n\n Since we cannot run code in this environment, we have to simulate the output of such a model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average by hour of the four days to forecast the next four days.\n\n Let me calculate the average for each hour:\n\n   For hour 00:00: (3.411, 2.955, 2.224, 2.315) -> average = (3.411+2.955+2.224+2.315)/4 = 2.72625\n   For hour 01:00: (3.868, 2.863, 2.345, 2.102) -> average = (3.868+2.863+2.345+2.102)/4 = 2.7945\n   ... and so on for each of the 24 hours.\n\n Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be:\n   Day 1 (2017-07-12): the 24 hourly averages (from 00:00 to 23:00) of the past 4 days.\n   Day 2 (2017-07-13): same 24 hourly averages (repeated).\n   Day 3 (2017-07-14): same.\n   Day 4 (2017-07-15): same.\n\n But note: this method ignores any trend and recent changes. However, with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n However, looking at the data, there is a drop on July 10 and 11 in the early hours? But then a peak at night on July 11.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n Given the problem, we must provide the data. We'll use the average method.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n  00:00: (3.411 + 2.955 + 2.224 + 2.315) / 4 = 2.72625\n  01:00: (3.868 + 2.863 + 2.345 + 2.102) / 4 = 2.7945\n  02:00: (3.594 + 2.833 + 2.345 + 1.858) / 4 = 2.6575\n  03:00: (2.894 + 2.802 + 2.193 + 1.828) / 4 = 2.42925\n  04:00: (3.015 + 2.833 + 2.163 + 1.949) / 4 = 2.4900\n  05:00: (3.381 + 2.924 + 2.376 + 2.406) / 4 = 2.77175\n  06:00: (3.168 + 3.046 + 2.955 + 2.680) / 4 = 2.96225\n  07:00: (3.320 + 3.229 + 3.137 + 2.833) / 4 = 3.12975\n  08:00: (3.290 + 3.107 + 3.259 + 3.015) / 4 = 3.16775\n  09:00: (3.107 + 2.833 + 3.350 + 3.046) / 4 = 3.084\n  10:00: (3.381 + 3.472 + 3.594 + 3.564) / 4 = 3.50275\n  11:00: (3.655 + 3.503 + 3.503 + 3.198) / 4 = 3.46475\n  12:00: (3.564 + 2.802 + 2.833 + 3.015) / 4 = 3.0535\n  13:00: (3.229 + 2.559 + 2.772 + 3.046) / 4 = 2.9015\n  14:00: (3.137 + 2.741 + 2.833 + 3.015) / 4 = 2.9315\n  15:00: (2.955 + 2.467 + 3.107 + 2.802) / 4 = 2.83275\n  16:00: (2.924 + 2.985 + 2.863 + 2.924) / 4 = 2.924\n  17:00: (3.411 + 3.076 + 3.107 + 3.320) / 4 = 3.2285\n  18:00: (3.259 + 2.741 + 2.619 + 3.350) / 4 = 2.99225\n  19:00: (3.686 + 2.254 + 2.498 + 3.472) / 4 = 2.9775\n  20:00: (4.538 + 2.802 + 3.411 + 4.386) / 4 = 3.78425\n  21:00: (3.899 + 2.772 + 2.985 + 4.173) / 4 = 3.45725\n  22:00: (3.594 + 2.498 + 2.559 + 3.960) / 4 = 3.15275\n  23:00: (3.533 + 2.528 + 2.528 + 3.594) / 4 = 3.04575\n\n Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is:\n\n  2017-07-12 00:00:00  2.72625\n  2017-07-12 01:00:00  2.7945\n  ... until 23:00:00 of 2017-07-12: 3.04575\n\n Then 2017-07-13 00:00:00: 2.72625 (same as 2017-07-12 00:00:00)\n and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not encountered in the provided 96 points, so we are safe.\n\n However, this method is very simple and might not capture the dynamics. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the last day (July 11) as the forecast? But that would be:\n\n  2017-07-12 00:00:00: 2.315\n  2017-07-12 01:00:00: 2.102\n  ... \n\n But then we ignore the previous days.\n\n Considering the requirement and the simplicity, we'll go with the average by hour.\n\n Let me write the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00) using the hourly averages.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n  Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00\n  Then 2017-07-12 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-12 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n  Then 2017-07-13 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n  Then 2017-07-14 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n  Then 2017-07-15 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n And the LUFL values will be the 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n We'll format the answer as:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\n2017-07-12 00:00:00 2.726\n2017-07-12 01:00:00 2.795\n...\n2017-07-15 23:00:00 3.046\n```\n\n But note: we must provide the exact numbers we calculated? We rounded to 3 decimals? The original data had 3 decimals.\n\n We'll round to 3 decimals as in the input.\n\n However, let's recalculate and round to 3 decimals:\n\n  00:00: (3.411+2.955+2.224+2.315)/4 = 10.905/4 = 2.72625 -> 2.726\n  01:00: (3.868+2.863+2.345+2.102)/4 = 11.178/4 = 2.7945 -> 2.795 (if we round to 3 decimals: 2.795)\n  02:00: (3.594+2.833+2.345+1.858)/4 = 10.63/4 = 2.6575 -> 2.658\n  03:00: (2.894+2.802+2.193+1.828)/4 = 9.717/4 = 2.42925 -> 2.429\n  04:00: (3.015+2.833+2.163+1.949)/4 = 9.96/4 = 2.490 -> 2.490\n  05:00: (3.381+2.924+2.376+2.406)/4 = 11.087/4 = 2.77175 -> 2.772\n  06:00: (3.168+3.046+2.955+2.680)/4 = 11.849/4 = 2.96225 -> 2.962\n  07:00: (3.320+3.229+3.137+2.833)/4 = 12.519/4 = 3.12975 -> 3.130\n  08:00: (3.290+3.107+3.259+3.015)/4 = 12.671/4 = 3.16775 -> 3.168\n  09:00: (3.107+2.833+3.350+3.046)/4 = 12.336/4 = 3.084 -> 3.084\n  10:00: (3.381+3.472+3.594+3.564)/4 = 14.011/4 = 3.50275 -> 3.503\n  11:00: (3.655+3.503+3.503+3.198)/4 = 13.859/4 = 3.46475 -> 3.465\n  12:00: (3.564+2.802+2.833+3.015)/4 = 12.214/4 = 3.0535 -> 3.054\n  13:00: (3.229+2.559+2.772+3.046)/4 = 11.606/4 = 2.9015 -> 2.902\n  14:00: (3.137+2.741+2.833+3.015)/4 = 11.726/4 = 2.9315 -> 2.932\n  15:00: (2.955+2.467+3.107+2.802)/4 = 11.331/4 = 2.83275 -> 2.833\n  16:00: (2.924+2.985+2.863+2.924)/4 = 11.696/4 = 2.924 -> 2.924\n  17:00: (3.411+3.076+3.107+3.320)/4 = 12.914/4 = 3.2285 -> 3.229\n  18:00: (3.259+2.741+2.619+3.350)/4 = 11.969/4 = 2.99225 -> 2.992\n  19:00: (3.686+2.254+2.498+3.472)/4 = 11.91/4 = 2.9775 -> 2.978\n  20:00: (4.538+2.802+3.411+4.386)/4 = 15.137/4 = 3.78425 -> 3.784\n  21:00: (3.899+2.772+2.985+4.173)/4 = 13.829/4 = 3.45725 -> 3.457\n  22:00: (3.594+2.498+2.559+3.960)/4 = 12.611/4 = 3.15275 -> 3.153\n  23:00: (3.533+2.528+2.528+3.594)/4 = 12.183/4 = 3.04575 -> 3.046\n\n Now, we'll create the next 96 points by repeating these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n We write the data in the format: \n   \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" <space> value\n\n We must generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... 23:00:00\n   Then 2017-07-13 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00\n   Then 2017-07-14 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00\n   Then 2017-07-15 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00\n\n And the LUFL values for each hour of the day are fixed as above.\n\n Let's write the first day (2017-07-12) with the 24 values:\n\n  2017-07-12 00:00:00 2.726\n  2017-07-12 01:00:00 2.795\n  2017-07-12 02:00:00 2.658\n  2017-07-12 03:00:00 2.429\n  2017-07-12 04:00:00 2.490\n  2017-07-12 05:00:00 2.772\n  2017-07-12 06:00:00 2.962\n  2017-07-12 07:00:00 3.130\n  2017-07-12 08:00:00 3.168\n  2017-07-12 09:00:00 3.084\n  2017-07-12 10:00:00 3.503\n  2017-07-12 11:00:00 3.465\n  2017-07-12 12:00:00 3.054\n  2017-07-12 13:00:00 2.902\n  2017-07-12 14:00:00 2.932\n  2017-07-12 15:00:00 2.833\n  2017-07-12 16:00:00 2.924\n  2017-07-12 17:00:00 3.229\n  2017-07-12 18:00:00 2.992\n  2017-07-12 19:00:00 2.978\n  2017-07-12 20:00:00 3.784\n  2017-07-12 21:00:00 3.457\n  2017-07-12 22:00:00 3.153\n  2017-07-12 23:00:00 3.046\n\n Then the next day (2017-07-13) we repeat the same 24 numbers:\n\n  2017-07-13 00:00:00 2.726\n  2017-07-13 01:00:00 2.795\n  ... and so on.\n\n We'll write all 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
