        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL data, starting from 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also weekly patterns might be present (but we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern is not evident).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates does not have any missing values in the given sample. However, the problem says the data will have missing values, so we should be cautious. Since we are only given a complete 96 points, we assume that for forecasting we can use the complete history provided.\n\n 3. We choose a model: Given the seasonality and the frequency (hourly), we can use a seasonal time series model. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) is a good candidate.\n\n 4. We need to determine the order of the SARIMA model. We can try to use auto_arima to find the best parameters, but since we are not running code, we have to rely on typical patterns.\n\n    - The data shows:\n        * Daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n        * The series has non-stationary features (mean and variance change over time) but we note that the pattern repeats daily.\n\n 5. Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days, we might also consider simpler models like:\n      - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, but ETS typically for shorter seasonal periods and we have 24.\n      - Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: forecast each hour of the same hour in the previous day. But that might not capture trends.\n\n 6. However, the problem states that we are an expert and we must provide the forecast. Since we cannot run code, we have to simulate the process.\n\n 7. Considering the constraints, we are going to use a simple approach: \n      - We will compute the average of each hour across the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n      But note: the data from 2016-11-15 and 2016-11-17 have a spike at midnight (00:00) that is not present on 2016-11-14 and 2016-11-16. \n      Also, the pattern on 2016-11-15 and 2016-11-17 are similar (with higher values) and 2016-11-14 and 2016-11-16 are similar (with lower values). \n      This might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot see weekly.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day? But we don't have a full week.\n\n 9. Since we are required to provide the next 96 points, we must generate 96 values.\n\n 10. We decide to use a moving average of the same hour for the past 4 days, but with a twist: we note that the pattern for weekdays might be different. \n      However, 2016-11-14 is Monday, 2016-11-15 Tuesday, 2016-11-16 Wednesday, 2016-11-17 Thursday. Then the next 4 days are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\n\n 11. Without having data, we cannot know the weekend pattern. Therefore, we assume that the pattern for Friday will be similar to Thursday (2016-11-17) and then Saturday and Sunday might be different? \n      But we don't have historical weekends. So we have to rely on the available 4 days.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide an answer, we will use the following:\n\n      For the first 24 hours (2016-11-18, Friday): we use the values from 2016-11-17 (Thursday) but adjusted by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the last 4 days for each hour, but with more weight on the most recent day.\n\n 14. We decide to use a simple average of the same hour for the last 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. However, note that the next 4 days are 4 different days of the week. \n      But without more history, we cannot account for weekly seasonality. So we will use the same pattern for all 4 days? That is, we forecast each hour by the average of that hour over the past 4 days.\n\n 15. Steps for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00):\n        Let h in [0,23]:\n            avg_h = average of LUFL at hour h on 2016-11-14, 2016-11-15, 2016-11-16, 2016-11-17.\n\n        Then for each day in the next 4 days (2016-11-18, 2016-11-19, 2016-11-20, 2016-11-21), the forecast for hour h is avg_h.\n\n 16. But note: the data for 2016-11-15 and 2016-11-17 are higher than 2016-11-14 and 2016-11-16. So the pattern for Tuesday and Thursday might be higher? \n      However, we are forecasting Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. We don't know if Friday is similar to Thursday? \n\n 17. Since we don't have information about the weekly pattern, we stick to the average.\n\n 18. Calculate the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00:00: (1.462 + 4.051 + 1.401 + 3.868) / 4 = (1.462+4.051=5.513; 5.513+1.401=6.914; 6.914+3.868=10.782) -> 10.782/4 = 2.6955\n      Similarly for the rest.\n\n 19. However, note that the data for 2016-11-15 00:00 is 4.051 and 2016-11-17 00:00 is 3.868, which are much higher than the other two days. \n      This might be an anomaly? But we are told to forecast, so we use the available.\n\n 20. We compute the average for each hour and then repeat that same 24-hour average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 21. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. We are not told that the future has missing values? \n      We are to forecast the next 96 points without missing? So we provide 96 numbers.\n\n 22. We generate the next 96 points by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 23. However, we must also consider that there might be a trend? The data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. \n      The values on 2016-11-17 are similar to 2016-11-15. So we ignore trend.\n\n 24. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00: (1.462 + 4.051 + 1.401 + 3.868) / 4 = 2.6955\n      Hour 01: (1.097 + 3.777 + 1.127 + 3.716) / 4 = (1.097+3.777=4.874; 4.874+1.127=6.001; 6.001+3.716=9.717) -> 9.717/4=2.42925\n      Hour 02: (1.127+3.594+1.157+3.807)/4 = (1.127+3.594=4.721; 4.721+1.157=5.878; 5.878+3.807=9.685) -> 9.685/4=2.42125\n      Hour 03: (1.127+3.686+1.218+3.686)/4 = (1.127+3.686=4.813; 4.813+1.218=6.031; 6.031+3.686=9.717) -> 9.717/4=2.42925\n      Hour 04: (1.066+3.716+1.432+3.777)/4 = (1.066+3.716=4.782; 4.782+1.432=6.214; 6.214+3.777=9.991) -> 9.991/4=2.49775\n      Hour 05: (1.340+3.960+1.462+3.990)/4 = (1.340+3.960=5.3; 5.3+1.462=6.762; 6.762+3.990=10.752) -> 10.752/4=2.688\n      Hour 06: (1.828+4.630+2.071+4.417)/4 = (1.828+4.630=6.458; 6.458+2.071=8.529; 8.529+4.417=12.946) -> 12.946/4=3.2365\n      Hour 07: (2.528+5.087+2.467+4.934)/4 = (2.528+5.087=7.615; 7.615+2.467=10.082; 10.082+4.934=15.016) -> 15.016/4=3.754\n      Hour 08: (2.559+2.467+2.376+2.345)/4 = (2.559+2.467=5.026; 5.026+2.376=7.402; 7.402+2.345=9.747) -> 9.747/4=2.43675\n      Hour 09: (2.589+2.315+2.376+2.224)/4 = (2.589+2.315=4.904; 4.904+2.376=7.28; 7.28+2.224=9.504) -> 9.504/4=2.376\n      Hour 10: (2.863+2.345+2.528+2.315)/4 = (2.863+2.345=5.208; 5.208+2.528=7.736; 7.736+2.315=10.051) -> 10.051/4=2.51275\n      Hour 11: (3.137+2.894+2.924+3.107)/4 = (3.137+2.894=6.031; 6.031+2.924=8.955; 8.955+3.107=12.062) -> 12.062/4=3.0155\n      Hour 12: (2.498+2.102+2.193+2.041)/4 = (2.498+2.102=4.6; 4.6+2.193=6.793; 6.793+2.041=8.834) -> 8.834/4=2.2085\n      Hour 13: (2.224+2.132+2.193+1.797)/4 = (2.224+2.132=4.356; 4.356+2.193=6.549; 6.549+1.797=8.346) -> 8.346/4=2.0865\n      Hour 14: (1.949+2.102+1.858+2.102)/4 = (1.949+2.102=4.051; 4.051+1.858=5.909; 5.909+2.102=8.011) -> 8.011/4=2.00275\n      Hour 15: (1.980+2.254+1.675+2.041)/4 = (1.980+2.254=4.234; 4.234+1.675=5.909; 5.909+2.041=7.95) -> 7.95/4=1.9875\n      Hour 16: (2.041+2.132+3.015+2.132)/4 = (2.041+2.132=4.173; 4.173+3.015=7.188; 7.188+2.132=9.32) -> 9.32/4=2.33\n      Hour 17: (2.619+2.619+3.046+2.589)/4 = (2.619+2.619=5.238; 5.238+3.046=8.284; 8.284+2.589=10.873) -> 10.873/4=2.71825\n      Hour 18: (2.559+2.650+3.015+2.559)/4 = (2.559+2.650=5.209; 5.209+3.015=8.224; 8.224+2.559=10.783) -> 10.783/4=2.69575\n      Hour 19: (2.467+2.406+2.406+2.132)/4 = (2.467+2.406=4.873; 4.873+2.406=7.279; 7.279+2.132=9.411) -> 9.411/4=2.35275\n      Hour 20: (2.102+2.224+2.102+1.919)/4 = (2.102+2.224=4.326; 4.326+2.102=6.428; 6.428+1.919=8.347) -> 8.347/4=2.08675\n      Hour 21: (1.736+1.675+1.614+1.553)/4 = (1.736+1.675=3.411; 3.411+1.614=5.025; 5.025+1.553=6.578) -> 6.578/4=1.6445\n      Hour 22: (1.340+1.401+1.340+1.218)/4 = (1.340+1.401=2.741; 2.741+1.340=4.081; 4.081+1.218=5.299) -> 5.299/4=1.32475\n      Hour 23: (1.401+1.584+1.462+1.218)/4 = (1.401+1.584=2.985; 2.985+1.462=4.447; 4.447+1.218=5.665) -> 5.665/4=1.41625\n\n 25. Now, we create the next 96 points by repeating these 24 averages 4 times.\n\n 26. The dates: \n        Start: 2016-11-18 00:00:00 (next after 2016-11-17 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-11-18 01:00:00 ... up to 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n\n 27. Format: We must output the data in the same format as the input, with two columns: date and LUFL.\n\n 28. We round the LUFL values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 29. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values. But we are generating a forecast without missing values? \n      The instruction: \"forecast the data for next 96 recorded dates\" and \"give me the complete data\". So we provide 96 records without missing.\n\n 30. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-18 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-11-18 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-11-21 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n 31. We use the computed averages for each hour and repeat for 4 days.\n\n 32. Let's list the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimal places):\n\n        h00: 2.696\n        h01: 2.429\n        h02: 2.421\n        h03: 2.429\n        h04: 2.498\n        h05: 2.688\n        h06: 3.237\n        h07: 3.754\n        h08: 2.437\n        h09: 2.376\n        h10: 2.513\n        h11: 3.016\n        h12: 2.209\n        h13: 2.087\n        h14: 2.003\n        h15: 1.988\n        h16: 2.330\n        h17: 2.718\n        h18: 2.696\n        h19: 2.353\n        h20: 2.087\n        h21: 1.645\n        h22: 1.325\n        h23: 1.416\n\n 33. Now, we generate 4 days of data.\n\n 34. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 35. Note: The original data had some variation and our forecast is a smoothed average. This is a simple approach.\n\n 36. We output the entire 96 records.\n\n 37. We are aware that this is a naive method, but given the constraints (no code, only 4 days of history) it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 38. We note that in practice, one would use more sophisticated models and more data.\n\n 39. We write the answer in the required format.\n",
