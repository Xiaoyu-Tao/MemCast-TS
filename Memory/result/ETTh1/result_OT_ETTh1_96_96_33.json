        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 24*4=96).\n 3. We need to choose a suitable time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history and the hourly seasonality (daily pattern of 24 hours),\n    we can consider models that capture seasonality. However, with only 4 days of data, it's challenging to capture weekly patterns, but we can try to capture daily seasonality.\n\n 4. Since we are to provide the forecast for the next 96 dates, we must generate the datetime index accordingly.\n\n 5. We can use a simple seasonal model or a model like SARIMA. However, note that we have only 96 points, which is limited for fitting a SARIMA model with multiple seasonal parameters.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler method such as:\n    - Using the last 24 hours (one day) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend and might not be accurate.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24).\n\n 7. Given the data, we observe a daily pattern? Let's check:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-11-10): \n        OT starts at 12.522, goes down to 10.904 at 17:00 and 18:00, then rises to 12.381 at 23:00.\n    Day 2 (2016-11-11): \n        Starts at 13.085, then rises to 19.768 at 14:00, then falls to 15.406 at 23:00.\n    Day 3 (2016-11-12): \n        Starts at 16.039, peaks at 18.572 at 16:00, then falls to 16.883 at 23:00.\n    Day 4 (2016-11-13): \n        Starts at 17.165, peaks at 20.471 at 15:00, then falls to 19.486 at 23:00.\n\n    There is a pattern of a daily peak in the afternoon? But the magnitude varies.\n\n 8. Given the limited data, we can try to use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, we are required to forecast 96 points.\n\n 9. We can use the following approach:\n    - Use a seasonal decomposition to separate the data into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n    - Then forecast each component? But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal forecast: \n      y_{t+24} = y_t   (for the first day ahead) but then for the next 96, we can do:\n      For the first 24 hours: use the last available day (day 4) as the base, then for the next 24, use day 3? \n      But that doesn't seem right.\n\n 11. Given the constraints, I propose to use a simple Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n 12. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n      - We have to handle the fact that we have only 4 periods (4 days) of data for a 24-hour cycle.\n\n 13. We can be done using `statsmodels` but note: we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a method that we can compute manually or describe.\n\n 14. However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. Since we cannot run code, we need to think of an alternative.\n\n 15. Another idea: use the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n     For example:\n        Let H00 = average of the 00:00:00 of the 4 days: (12.522 + 13.085 + 16.039 + 17.165)/4\n        Similarly for H01, H02, ... H23.\n\n     Then the forecast for the next 4 days would be:\n        Day5: H00, H01, ... H23\n        Day6: H00, H01, ... H23\n        Day7: H00, H01, ... H23\n        Day8: H00, H01, ... H23\n\n 16. But note: there might be a trend? The data shows an increasing trend from day1 to day4? \n        Day1: max=14.773, min=10.904\n        Day2: max=19.768, min=13.085\n        Day3: max=18.572, min=15.828? (but note: at 00:00: 16.039, then 15.828 at 14:00? Actually the min on day3 is 15.828 at 14:00? \n        Actually looking at the data, the minimums are increasing: 10.904 (day1), 15.406 (day2), 16.250 (day3? but at 15:00 it was 17.305, then 16.672, ... actually the min on day3 is 15.828 at 14:00? \n        But then at 19:00: 17.727, 20:00:16.813, 21:00:17.376, 22:00:17.657, 23:00:16.883 -> so the min is 15.828 at 14:00? \n        Day4: min=17.165 at 00:00? Actually the min on day4 is 15.969 at 07:00? \n\n     It's not clear. Alternatively, we can compute the average of each hour and then adjust by a linear trend? \n\n 17. Given the complexity and the fact that we have only 4 days, the average by hour might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 18. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00): \n        day1: 12.522\n        day2: 13.085\n        day3: 16.039\n        day4: 17.165\n        average = (12.522 + 13.085 + 16.039 + 17.165) / 4 = 14.70275\n\n     Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00):\n        day1: 12.381\n        day2: 13.296\n        day3: 16.109\n        day4: 18.009\n        average = (12.381+13.296+16.109+18.009)/4 = 14.94875\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 19. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same 24-hour average pattern for 4 times.\n\n 20. However, note that the data might have a trend. We can try to adjust the average pattern by a linear trend? \n\n     We can compute the overall average for each day and see if there's a trend:\n\n        Day1: average of 24 hours = (sum of day1 values)/24\n        Day1: 12.522, 12.381, 13.085, 12.874, 12.944, 14.491, 14.280, 14.773, 14.491, 14.280, 12.240, 12.029, 11.678, 13.366, 12.592, 11.256, 11.537, 10.904, 10.904, 11.326, 11.748, 12.522, 12.592, 12.381\n        Sum = 300.??? (let me compute:)\n\n        Actually, we can note that the average of each day might be increasing. But without exact calculation, we can see that day1 has lower values than day4.\n\n 21. We can do:\n\n        Let T = 4 (days) and we are at time t (from 0 to 95). We want to forecast t=96 to 191.\n\n        We can model: \n          y_t = (level + trend * t) * seasonal_index\n\n        But we don't have enough data to estimate a multiplicative model. Alternatively, additive:\n\n          y_t = level + trend * t + seasonal_index\n\n        We can estimate the trend: \n        We can take the average of the first day and the last day and compute the slope.\n\n        Let day1_avg = average of day1\n        day4_avg = average of day4\n\n        Then the trend per day (24 hours) = (day4_avg - day1_avg) / 3   (because from day1 to day4, 3 intervals)\n\n        Then the trend per hour = (day4_avg - day1_avg) / (3*24)\n\n        Then for the forecast period (day5 to day8, which are days 5,6,7,8), the trend component would be:\n\n          For hour i in the forecast (i from 0 to 95, which corresponds to day5: hour0 to day8: hour23):\n\n          total_hours_from_start = 96 + i   (since the first hour of the forecast is the 96th hour from the start of the given data)\n\n          trend_value = initial_trend + (96+i) * hourly_trend\n\n        But we don't have an initial_trend? We can set the level at the last point? \n\n 22. This becomes complex. Given the time and the fact that we are to provide the data, and the method must be simple, we might stick to the average by hour without trend.\n\n 23. However, let's compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1: \n          sum = 12.522+12.381+13.085+12.874+12.944+14.491+14.280+14.773+14.491+14.280+12.240+12.029+11.678+13.366+12.592+11.256+11.537+10.904+10.904+11.326+11.748+12.522+12.592+12.381\n          = 12.522+12.381=24.903; +13.085=37.988; +12.874=50.862; +12.944=63.806; +14.491=78.297; +14.280=92.577; +14.773=107.35; +14.491=121.841; +14.280=136.121; +12.240=148.361; +12.029=160.39; +11.678=172.068; +13.366=185.434; +12.592=198.026; +11.256=209.282; +11.537=220.819; +10.904=231.723; +10.904=242.627; +11.326=253.953; +11.748=265.701; +12.522=278.223; +12.592=290.815; +12.381=303.196\n\n          average_day1 = 303.196 / 24 = 12.633166666666667\n\n        Day2:\n          data: 13.085,13.296,13.436,14.351,13.014,13.296,12.874,12.944,13.999,13.647,13.507,14.703,15.547,18.994,19.768,18.572,18.572,17.657,15.687,15.758,16.321,15.828,15.406\n          Wait, I see 24 points? \n          Actually, the data for day2: from 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 points.\n\n          Let me sum: \n          13.085+13.296=26.381; +13.436=39.817; +14.351=54.168; +13.014=67.182; +13.296=80.478; +12.874=93.352; +12.944=106.296; +13.999=120.295; +13.647=133.942; +13.507=147.449; +14.703=162.152; +15.547=177.699; +18.994=196.693; +19.768=216.461; +18.572=235.033; +18.572=253.605; +17.657=271.262; +15.687=286.949; +15.758=302.707; +16.321=319.028; +15.828=334.856; +15.406=350.262\n\n          average_day2 = 350.262 / 24 = 14.59425\n\n        Day3:\n          data: 16.039,16.109,15.969,16.461,16.250,16.321,16.461,16.602,17.094,16.602,16.321,16.532,16.250,16.250,15.828,17.305,16.672,18.572,17.727,16.813,17.376,17.657,16.883\n          Sum: \n          16.039+16.109=32.148; +15.969=48.117; +16.461=64.578; +16.250=80.828; +16.321=97.149; +16.461=113.61; +16.602=130.212; +17.094=147.306; +16.602=163.908; +16.321=180.229; +16.532=196.761; +16.250=213.011; +16.250=229.261; +15.828=245.089; +17.305=262.394; +16.672=279.066; +18.572=297.638; +17.727=315.365; +16.813=332.178; +17.376=349.554; +17.657=367.211; +16.883=384.094\n\n          average_day3 = 384.094 / 24 = 16.003916666666666\n\n        Day4:\n          data: 17.165,18.009,17.798,17.516,18.501,17.868,17.516,15.969,16.743,18.009,18.220,18.853,19.556,19.205,19.627,20.471,20.119,19.556,19.697,19.064,19.768,19.768,20.330,19.486\n          Sum:\n          17.165+18.009=35.174; +17.798=52.972; +17.516=70.488; +18.501=88.989; +17.868=106.857; +17.516=124.373; +15.969=140.342; +16.743=157.085; +18.009=175.094; +18.220=193.314; +18.853=212.167; +19.556=231.723; +19.205=250.928; +19.627=270.555; +20.471=291.026; +20.119=311.145; +19.556=330.701; +19.697=350.398; +19.064=369.462; +19.768=389.230; +19.768=408.998; +20.330=429.328; +19.486=448.814\n\n          average_day4 = 448.814 / 24 = 18.700583333333333\n\n        The daily averages: \n          day1: 12.6332\n          day2: 14.5943\n          day3: 16.0039\n          day4: 18.7006\n\n        The trend per day: \n          from day1 to day2: +1.9611\n          day2 to day3: +1.4096\n          day3 to day4: +2.6967\n\n        Average daily increase: (1.9611+1.4096+2.6967)/3 = 2.0224666666666665\n\n        So the trend per day is about 2.0225.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we can project the daily average:\n\n          day5: 18.7006 + 2.0225 = 20.7231\n          day6: 20.7231 + 2.0225 = 22.7456\n          day7: 22.7456 + 2.0225 = 24.7681\n          day8: 24.7681 + 2.0225 = 26.7906\n\n 24. Now, we have the daily average for the next 4 days. How to distribute by hour?\n\n      We can use the relative seasonal pattern from the last day (day4) or the average of the 4 days? \n\n      Since the pattern might change, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour (as computed in step 18) and then scale it to the projected daily average.\n\n      But note: the average of the 4 days for a fixed hour is the average of 4 days, which had increasing averages. \n\n      Alternatively, we can compute the seasonal indices for each hour relative to the daily average.\n\n      For each hour_i in [0,23]:\n          seasonal_index_i = (average of hour_i over 4 days) / (overall average of all data)\n\n      But we want to preserve the relative pattern.\n\n 25. Let's compute the overall average of the entire 96 points:\n\n        total_sum = 303.196 (day1) + 350.262 (day2) + 384.094 (day3) + 448.814 (day4) = 1486.366\n        overall_avg = 1486.366 / 96 = 15.483\n\n      Then for each hour_i, we have:\n          avg_hour_i = (value_day1_i + value_day2_i + value_day3_i + value_day4_i) / 4\n          seasonal_index_i = avg_hour_i / overall_avg   [if multiplicative]\n\n      But we are going to use additive? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use additive seasonal indices:\n\n          seasonal_index_i = avg_hour_i - overall_avg\n\n      Then for a future day j (j=5,6,7,8) with daily average = M_j, we set:\n\n          forecast for hour_i in day j = M_j + seasonal_index_i\n\n      But note: the sum of the seasonal indices for a day should be zero? \n\n      Let me check: \n          Sum_{i=0}^{23} seasonal_index_i = sum_{i} (avg_hour_i) - 24 * overall_avg\n          = (sum_{i} (avg_hour_i)) - 24 * (total_sum/96)\n          = (total_sum/4) - 24 * (total_sum/96) ) \n          = (total_sum/4) - (total_sum/4) = 0.\n\n      So additive indices sum to zero.\n\n 26. Steps:\n\n      Step 1: Compute the overall average = total_sum / 96 = 1486.366 / 96 = 15.483\n\n      Step 2: For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days -> avg_hour_i.\n\n      Step 3: Compute the additive seasonal index: s_i = avg_hour_i - 15.483\n\n      Step 4: For each future day j (from 5 to 8) with projected daily average M_j (20.7231, 22.7456, 24.7681, 26.7906), \n              the forecast for hour i in day j is: M_j + s_i\n\n 27. But note: the daily average M_j is the average of the 24 hours of that day. And we have:\n\n        average of (M_j + s_i for i in 0..23) = M_j + (sum_i s_i)/24 = M_j + 0 = M_j.\n\n      So it matches.\n\n 28. Now, we need to compute the 24 seasonal indices.\n\n      We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (12.522 + 13.085 + 16.039 + 17.165)/4 = (12.522+13.085=25.607; +16.039=41.646; +17.165=58.811) -> 58.811/4=14.70275\n        hour1: (12.381+13.296+16.109+18.009)/4 = (12.381+13.296=25.677; +16.109=41.786; +18.009=59.795) -> 59.795/4=14.94875\n        hour2: (13.085+13.436+15.969+17.798)/4 = (13.085+13.436=26.521; +15.969=42.49; +17.798=60.288) -> 60.288/4=15.072\n        hour3: (12.874+14.351+16.461+17.516)/4 = (12.874+14.351=27.225; +16.461=43.686; +17.516=61.202) -> 61.202/4=15.3005\n        hour4: (12.944+13.014+16.250+18.501)/4 = (12.944+13.014=25.958; +16.250=42.208; +18.501=60.709) -> 60.709/4=15.17725\n        hour5: (14.491+13.296+16.321+17.868)/4 = (14.491+13.296=27.787; +16.321=44.108; +17.868=61.976) -> 61.976/4=15.494\n        hour6: (14.280+12.874+16.461+17.516)/4 = (14.280+12.874=27.154; +16.461=43.615; +17.516=61.131) -> 61.131/4=15.28275\n        hour7: (14.773+12.944+16.602+15.969)/4 = (14.773+12.944=27.717; +16.602=44.319; +15.969=60.288) -> 60.288/4=15.072\n        hour8: (14.491+13.999+17.094+16.743)/4 = (14.491+13.999=28.49; +17.094=45.584; +16.743=62.327) -> 62.327/4=15.58175\n        hour9: (14.280+13.647+16.602+18.009)/4 = (14.280+13.647=27.927; +16.602=44.529; +18.009=62.538) -> 62.538/4=15.6345\n        hour10: (12.240+13.507+16.321+18.220)/4 = (12.240+13.507=25.747; +16.321=42.068; +18.220=60.288) -> 60.288/4=15.072\n        hour11: (12.029+14.703+16.532+18.853)/4 = (12.029+14.703=26.732; +16.532=43.264; +18.853=62.117) -> 62.117/4=15.52925\n        hour12: (11.678+15.547+16.250+19.556)/4 = (11.678+15.547=27.225; +16.250=43.475; +19.556=63.031) -> 63.031/4=15.75775\n        hour13: (13.366+18.994+16.250+19.205)/4 = (13.366+18.994=32.36; +16.250=48.61; +19.205=67.815) -> 67.815/4=16.95375\n        hour14: (12.592+19.768+15.828+19.627)/4 = (12.592+19.768=32.36; +15.828=48.188; +19.627=67.815) -> 67.815/4=16.95375\n        hour15: (11.256+18.572+17.305+20.471)/4 = (11.256+18.572=29.828; +17.305=47.133; +20.471=67.604) -> 67.604/4=16.901\n        hour16: (11.537+18.572+16.672+20.119)/4 = (11.537+18.572=30.109; +16.672=46.781; +20.119=66.9) -> 66.9/4=16.725\n        hour17: (10.904+17.657+18.572+19.556)/4 = (10.904+17.657=28.561; +18.572=47.133; +19.556=66.689) -> 66.689/4=16.67225\n        hour18: (10.904+15.687+17.727+19.697)/4 = (10.904+15.687=26.591; +17.727=44.318; +19.697=64.015) -> 64.015/4=16.00375\n        hour19: (11.326+15.758+16.813+19.064)/4 = (11.326+15.758=27.084; +16.813=43.897; +19.064=62.961) -> 62.961/4=15.74025\n        hour20: (11.748+16.321+17.376+19.768)/4 = (11.748+16.321=28.069; +17.376=45.445; +19.768=65.213) -> 65.213/4=16.30325\n        hour21: (12.522+15.828+17.657+19.768)/4 = (12.522+15.828=28.35; +17.657=46.007; +19.768=65.775) -> 65.775/4=16.44375\n        hour22: (12.592+15.406+16.883+20.330)/4 = (12.592+15.406=27.998; +16.883=44.881; +20.330=65.211) -> 65.211/4=16.30275\n        hour23: (12.381+15.406+16.883+19.486)/4 = (12.381+15.406=27.787; +16.883=44.67; +19.486=64.156) -> 64.156/4=16.039\n\n      Then the seasonal indices s_i = avg_hour_i - 15.483\n\n        hour0: 14.70275 - 15.483 = -0.78025\n        hour1: 14.94875 - 15.483 = -0.53425\n        hour2: 15.072 - 15.483 = -0.411\n        hour3: 15.3005 - 15.483 = -0.1825\n        hour4: 15.17725 - 15.483 = -0.30575\n        hour5: 15.494 - 15.483 = 0.011\n        hour6: 15.28275 - 15.483 = -0.20025\n        hour7: 15.072 - 15.483 = -0.411\n        hour8: 15.58175 - 15.483 = 0.09875\n        hour9: 15.6345 - 15.483 = 0.1515\n        hour10: 15.072 - 15.483 = -0.411\n        hour11: 15.52925 - 15.483 = 0.04625\n        hour12: 15.75775 - 15.483 = 0.27475\n        hour13: 16.95375 - 15.483 = 1.47075\n        hour14: 16.95375 - 15.483 = 1.47075\n        hour15: 16.901 - 15.483 = 1.418\n        hour16: 16.725 - 15.483 = 1.242\n        hour17: 16.67225 - 15.483 = 1.18925\n        hour18: 16.00375 - 15.483 = 0.52075\n        hour19: 15.74025 - 15.483 = 0.25725\n        hour20: 16.30325 - 15.483 = 0.82025\n        hour21: 16.44375 - 15.483 = 0.96075\n        hour22: 16.30275 - 15.483 = 0.81975\n        hour23: 16.039 - 15.483 = 0.556\n\n 29. Now, the projected daily averages for the next 4 days:\n\n        day5: 20.7231\n        day6: 22.7456\n        day7: 24.7681\n        day8: 26.7906\n\n 30. Then the forecast for:\n\n        Day5, hour0: 20.7231 + (-0.78025) = 19.94285\n        Day5, hour1: 20.7231 + (-0.53425) = 20.18885\n        ... and so on.\n\n 31. We'll generate 96 points.\n\n 32. However, note: the last given data point is at 2016-11-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours start at 2016-11-14 00:00:00 and go to 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n\n 33. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 34. But note: the data provided starts at 2016-11-10 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-11-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00, 2016-11-14 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n\n 35. We'll create the forecast in the order of the next 96 hours.\n\n 36. Let's write the first few:\n\n        date: 2016-11-14 00:00:00 -> OT = 20.7231 + s0 = 20.7231 - 0.78025 = 19.94285\n        date: 2016-11-14 01:00:00 -> OT = 20.7231 + s1 = 20.7231 - 0.53425 = 20.18885\n        date: 2016-11-14 02:00:00 -> OT = 20.7231 + s2 = 20.7231 - 0.411 = 20.3121\n        date: 2016-11-14 03:00:00 -> OT = 20.7231 + s3 = 20.7231 - 0.1825 = 20.5406\n        date: 2016-11-14 04:00:00 -> OT = 20.7231 + s4 = 20.7231 - 0.30575 = 20.41735\n        date: 2016-11-14 05:00:00 -> OT = 20.7231 + s5 = 20.7231 + 0.011 = 20.7341\n        ...\n\n 37. Then for day6 (2016-11-15) we use M_j = 22.7456 and the same s_i.\n\n 38. We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 39. But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the provided data? But in the given 96 points, we have no missing. So we are safe.\n\n 40. We'll output the next 96 points in the format.\n\n 41. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 42. Let's do the first day (day5: 2016-11-14) as an example:\n\n        hour0: 19.943\n        hour1: 20.189\n        hour2: 20.312\n        hour3: 20.541\n        hour4: 20.417\n        hour5: 20.734\n        hour6: 20.523\n        [because: 20.7231 -0.20025 = 20.52285 -> 20.523]\n        hour7: 20.312   [20.7231-0.411=20.3121 -> 20.312]\n        hour8: 20.822   [20.7231+0.09875=20.82185 -> 20.822]\n        hour9: 20.875   [20.7231+0.1515=20.8746 -> 20.875]\n        hour10: 20.312  [20.7231-0.411=20.3121 -> 20.312]\n        hour11: 20.769  [20.7231+0.04625=20.76935 -> 20.769]\n        hour12: 20.998  [20.7231+0.27475=20.99785 -> 20.998]\n        hour13: 22.194  [20.7231+1.47075=22.19385 -> 22.194]\n        hour14: 22.194  [same as hour13? Actually, we have two hours with the same index? But note: hour13 and hour14 have the same s_i? \n                Actually, in our calculation, hour13 and hour14 both had 16.95375, so same s_i? \n                But in the data, hour13 and hour14 are different. However, in the average over 4 days, they happened to be the same? \n                So we use the same s_i for both? \n                But note: hour13 is 13:00 and hour14 is 14:00. They are different hours. \n                Actually, we computed:\n\n                  hour13: (13.366+18.994+16.250+19.205)/4 = 16.95375\n                  hour14: (12.592+19.768+15.828+19.627)/4 = 16.95375\n\n                So they are the same. So we use the same index.\n\n        hour14: 22.194\n        hour15: 22.141  [20.7231+1.418=22.1411 -> 22.141]\n        hour16: 21.965  [20.7231+1.242=21.9651 -> 21.965]\n        hour17: 21.912  [20.7231+1.18925=21.91235 -> 21.912]\n        hour18: 21.244  [20.7231+0.52075=21.24385 -> 21.244]\n        hour19: 20.980  [20.7231+0.25725=20.98035 -> 20.980]\n        hour20: 21.543  [20.7231+0.82025=21.54335 -> 21.543]\n        hour21: 21.684  [20.7231+0.96075=21.68385 -> 21.684]\n        hour22: 21.543  [20.7231+0.81975=21.54285 -> 21.543]\n        hour23: 21.279  [20.7231+0.556=21.2791 -> 21.279]\n\n 43. Then for day6 (2016-11-15) we use 22.7456:\n\n        hour0: 22.7456 - 0.78025 = 21.96535 -> 21.965\n        hour1: 22.7456 - 0.53425 = 22.21135 -> 22.211\n        ... and so on.\n\n 44. We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 45. However, note: the method is a bit simplistic and the data might have more complex patterns, but given the constraints, we proceed.\n\n 46. We'll write the full 96 points in the required format.\n\n 47. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we are safe.\n\n 48. We output the data in the same format: two columns: \"date\" and \"OT\", with the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 49. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        start: 2016-11-14 00:00:00\n        then 2016-11-14 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n\n 50. We'll write the data in a code block.\n\n 51. Due to the length, we'll generate the data programmatically in our mind and write it.\n\n 52. But note: we are to provide the complete data, so we must write 96 lines.\n\n 53. We'll do it by creating a list of the seasonal indices and then for each day (5,6,7,8) we add the daily average and the index.\n\n 54. Let s = [ \n        -0.78025, -0.53425, -0.411, -0.1825, -0.30575, 0.011, -0.20025, -0.411, \n        0.09875, 0.1515, -0.411, 0.04625, 0.27475, 1.47075, 1.47075, 1.418, \n        1.242, 1.18925, 0.52075, 0.25725, 0.82025, 0.96075, 0.81975, 0.556 \n    ]\n\n    and daily_avgs = [20.7231, 22.7456, 24.7681, 26.7906]\n\n 55. Then for day_index in [0,1,2,3] (representing day5 to day8):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            value = daily_avgs[day_index] + s[hour]\n            round to 3 decimals.\n\n 56. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 57. Let's code the dates:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016, 11, 14)\n        Then for i in range(96):\n            date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n 58. But we are writing by hand? We can do:\n\n        Day5: 2016-11-14 00:00:00 -> value0\n        ...\n        Day5: 2016-11-14 23:00:00 -> value23\n\n        Day6: 2016-11-15 00:00:00 -> value24 (which is the first hour of day6: using daily_avgs[1] and s[0])\n        ...\n\n 59. Actually, we can iterate:\n\n        for day in 0..3:\n            for hour in 0..23:\n                date = 2016-11-14 + day days and hour hours.\n\n 60. We'll write the data in order.\n\n 61.
