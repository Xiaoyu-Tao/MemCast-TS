        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, for forecasting, we will assume the given data is complete for the past 96 points. If there were missing values, we would have to impute them, but the provided data seems complete.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series method that can handle hourly data and capture daily seasonality (since there is a pattern every 24 hours).\n\n 4. Since we are in an expert setting and without specific model constraints, we can choose a model. Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. One common approach is to use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. However, with 96 points, we have limited data. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which is suitable for seasonality and short series.\n\n 5. But note: the data shows multiple seasonality? We only have 4 days, so we can only capture daily seasonality (24 hours). \n\n 6. We can also consider using a simple moving average or linear regression with time and lag features, but given the seasonality, we need to account for the daily pattern.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we will use a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n 8. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n    - We have to set the seasonal period to 24 (for daily seasonality in hourly data).\n    - We'll fit the model on the provided 96 points.\n\n 9. However, note that the data might have non-constant variance or trend? Let's observe:\n    - The data does not to have a strong trend (it goes up and down daily) but the level changes from day? \n    - We'll let the model capture the level, trend (if any) and seasonality.\n\n 10. We'll use the `ExponentialSmoothing` from `statsmodels` library. But note: we are in a text-based environment and must generate the forecast without running code? \n\n 11. Since I cannot run code in this environment, I will describe the process and then generate a forecast by hand? That is not feasible. Instead, I will simulate the process by using a similar pattern from the past.\n\n 12. Alternative approach: \n     - We can use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? \n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 days we have and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 13. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the first day and the last day: \n     - Day 1 (2016-12-12): starts at 10.092, then goes down and then up to 10.589 at 6:00, then down again.\n     - Day 4 (2016-12-15): starts at 9.523, then 12.224 at 1:00, then down and then up to 10.127 at 6:00, then down.\n\n     The pattern is not exactly the same. However, without more data, the average per hour might be a simple and robust method.\n\n 14. We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days (which are 96 hours).\n\n 15. Steps for averaging:\n     - For hour 0: (10.092 + 8.066 + 10.270 + 9.523) / 4 = (10.092+8.066=18.158; 18.158+10.270=28.428; 28.428+9.523=37.951) -> 37.951/4 = 9.48775\n     - Similarly for hour 1: (7.747 + 6.574 + 11.300 + 12.224) / 4 = (7.747+6.574=14.321; 14.321+11.300=25.621; 25.621+12.224=37.845) -> 37.845/4 = 9.46125\n     - ... and so on for all 24 hours.\n\n 16. Then we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times (for the next 4 days).\n\n 17. However, note that the problem says there might be missing values in the data? But the provided 96 points are complete. So we can use them.\n\n 18. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then assign the same pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 19. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (10.092, 8.066, 10.270, 9.523) -> 9.48775\n     Hour 1: (7.747, 6.574, 11.300, 12.224) -> 9.46125\n     Hour 2: (9.594, 7.000, 9.808, 9.737) -> (9.594+7.000=16.594; 16.594+9.808=26.402; 26.402+9.737=36.139) -> 9.03475\n     Hour 3: (8.990, 7.676, 10.234, 9.666) -> (8.990+7.676=16.666; 16.666+10.234=26.9; 26.9+9.666=36.566) -> 9.1415\n     Hour 4: (9.310, 6.396, 9.985, 8.706) -> (9.310+6.396=15.706; 15.706+9.985=25.691; 25.691+8.706=34.397) -> 8.59925\n     Hour 5: (9.204, 6.858, 10.696, 9.914) -> (9.204+6.858=16.062; 16.062+10.696=26.758; 26.758+9.914=36.672) -> 9.168\n     Hour 6: (10.589, 6.325, 10.980, 10.127) -> (10.589+6.325=16.914; 16.914+10.980=27.894; 27.894+10.127=38.021) -> 9.50525\n     Hour 7: (9.061, 6.610, 11.975, 9.452) -> (9.061+6.610=15.671; 15.671+11.975=27.646; 27.646+9.452=37.098) -> 9.2745\n     Hour 8: (7.285, 6.823, 9.559, 9.097) -> (7.285+6.823=14.108; 14.108+9.559=23.667; 23.667+9.097=32.764) -> 8.191\n     Hour 9: (5.828, 6.254, 8.138, 6.858) -> (5.828+6.254=12.082; 12.082+8.138=20.220; 20.220+6.858=27.078) -> 6.7695\n     Hour 10: (6.183, 7.000, 8.635, 6.929) -> (6.183+7.000=13.183; 13.183+8.635=21.818; 21.818+6.929=28.747) -> 7.18675\n     Hour 11: (6.858, 6.325, 8.422, 7.143) -> (6.858+6.325=13.183; 13.183+8.422=21.605; 21.605+7.143=28.748) -> 7.187\n     Hour 12: (4.335, 4.868, 7.356, 5.010) -> (4.335+4.868=9.203; 9.203+7.356=16.559; 16.559+5.010=21.569) -> 5.39225\n     Hour 13: (4.797, 5.508, 6.858, 5.934) -> (4.797+5.508=10.305; 10.305+6.858=17.163; 17.163+5.934=23.097) -> 5.77425\n     Hour 14: (5.686, 5.010, 6.965, 6.290) -> (5.686+5.010=10.696; 10.696+6.965=17.661; 17.661+6.290=23.951) -> 5.98775\n     Hour 15: (5.615, 4.762, 6.787, 5.224) -> (5.615+4.762=10.377; 10.377+6.787=17.164; 17.164+5.224=22.388) -> 5.597\n     Hour 16: (5.543, 5.259, 7.320, 6.361) -> (5.543+5.259=10.802; 10.802+7.320=18.122; 18.122+6.361=24.483) -> 6.12075\n     Hour 17: (5.934, 5.721, 6.112, 6.361) -> (5.934+5.721=11.655; 11.655+6.112=17.767; 17.767+6.361=24.128) -> 6.032\n     Hour 18: (5.792, 5.010, 6.183, 6.645) -> (5.792+5.010=10.802; 10.802+6.183=16.985; 16.985+6.645=23.63) -> 5.9075\n     Hour 19: (5.117, 4.726, 6.148, 6.467) -> (5.117+4.726=9.843; 9.843+6.148=15.991; 15.991+6.467=22.458) -> 5.6145\n     Hour 20: (4.939, 4.193, 5.579, 5.899) -> (4.939+4.193=9.132; 9.132+5.579=14.711; 14.711+5.899=20.61) -> 5.1525\n     Hour 21: (4.087, 4.122, 5.224, 5.437) -> (4.087+4.122=8.209; 8.209+5.224=13.433; 13.433+5.437=18.87) -> 4.7175\n     Hour 22: (6.112, 6.610, 6.858, 6.752) -> (6.112+6.610=12.722; 12.722+6.858=19.580; 19.580+6.752=26.332) -> 6.583\n     Hour 23: (5.970, 7.889, 8.031, 7.640) -> (5.970+7.889=13.859; 13.859+8.031=21.890; 21.890+7.640=29.530) -> 7.3825\n\n 20. Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the above 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n 21. The next 96 hours start at 2016-12-16 00:00:00 and go to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We'll output the data in the same format: two columns: date\" and \"MUFL\", with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 23. We'll generate the dates: \n     - Start: 2016-12-16 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n 24. The MUFL values will be:\n        Day 1 (2016-12-16): [9.48775, 9.46125, 9.03475, 9.1415, 8.59925, 9.168, 9.50525, 9.2745, 8.191, 6.7695, 7.18675, 7.187, 5.39225, 5.77425, 5.98775, 5.597, 6.12075, 6.032, 5.9075, 5.6145, 5.1525, 4.7175, 6.583, 7.3825]\n        Day 2 (2016-12-17): same as above\n        Day 3 (2016-12-18): same as above\n        Day 4 (2016-12-19): same as above\n\n 25. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 26. However, note: the input has 3 decimal places. So we round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n 27. Let's round the averages:\n\n     Hour0: 9.48775 -> 9.488\n     Hour1: 9.46125 -> 9.461\n     Hour2: 9.03475 -> 9.035\n     Hour3: 9.1415  -> 9.142\n     Hour4: 8.59925 -> 8.599\n     Hour5: 9.168   -> 9.168\n     Hour6: 9.50525 -> 9.505\n     Hour7: 9.2745  -> 9.275\n     Hour8: 8.191   -> 8.191\n     Hour9: 6.7695  -> 6.770\n     Hour10:7.18675 -> 7.187\n     Hour11:7.187   -> 7.187\n     Hour12:5.39225 -> 5.392\n     Hour13:5.77425 -> 5.774\n     Hour14:5.98775 -> 5.988\n     Hour15:5.597   -> 5.597\n     Hour16:6.12075 -> 6.121\n     Hour17:6.032   -> 6.032\n     Hour18:5.9075  -> 5.908\n     Hour19:5.6145  -> 5.615\n     Hour20:5.1525  -> 5.153\n     Hour21:4.7175  -> 4.718\n     Hour22:6.583   -> 6.583\n     Hour23:7.3825  -> 7.383\n\n 28.
