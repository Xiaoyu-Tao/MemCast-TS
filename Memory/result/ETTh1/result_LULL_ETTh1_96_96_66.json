        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to produce 96 future points (so 4 days).\n 2. The data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete? We are only given 96 consecutive points without missing values in the provided segment.\n 3. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data for the past 96 dates does not show any missing value. So we assume that the provided 96 points are complete and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is a multi-step forecast) and the data is time series with possible seasonality (daily pattern, as we have 24 points per day), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex model training. Therefore, we will use a simple but effective method: \n   - We will decompose the series to capture the daily seasonality and then use an autoregressive method or a seasonal naive method.\n\n However, note: the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history. \n\n Alternative approach:\n   - We can use the average of each hour of the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that profile to forecast the next 4 days (since 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours).\n\n But note: the data does not only have daily seasonality? Let's check the pattern for each day:\n\n Day 1 (2017-03-22): \n   - Starts at 0.822, then decreases to 0.761, 0.731, then up to 1.036 at 4:00, then down and up again.\n\n However, looking at the four days, the pattern is not exactly the same. We might need a more robust method.\n\n Given the short history, we can try:\n   - Using a moving average model or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n But without being able to run code, we have to rely on a simple method.\n\n Proposed method:\n   - We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days, and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the method:\n   1. Group the data by hour (i.e., for hour 0, we have 4 values: one from each day; similarly for hour 1, etc.)\n   2. Compute the mean for each hour (if we have 4 values for that hour, then average them; if there are missing values we would have to handle, but in our case we have 4 complete days).\n   3. Then, for the next 96 hours (which are 4 days), we repeat the computed daily profile (the 24 hourly means) 4 times.\n\n However, note: the data might have a trend? But 4 days is too short to capture a trend. Also, the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", which might be relatively stable? \n\n Let's check the average of each day:\n   Day1: 2017-03-22: average = (0.822+0.761+0.731+0.761+1.036+0.853+0.761+0.914+1.097+1.279+1.005+1.097+0.853+0.822+0.914+0.944+0.914+0.975+0.944+0.914+0.975+0.975+0.883+0.548) / 24\n   Let me compute quickly: \n        Sum = 0.822+0.761+0.731+0.761+1.036+0.853+0.761+0.914+1.097+1.279+1.005+1.097+0.853+0.822+0.914+0.944+0.914+0.975+0.944+0.914+0.975+0.975+0.883+0.548\n        = 21.584\n        Average = 21.584 / 24 = 0.899333\n\n   Day2: 2017-03-23: \n        Sum = 1.249+1.157+1.310+1.218+1.432+0.731+0.853+1.127+1.279+1.127+1.249+1.005+0.883+1.127+1.036+1.066+1.188+1.066+0.883+1.005+1.005+0.975+0.914+0.792\n        = 25.271\n        Average = 25.271/24 = 1.052958\n\n   Day3: 2017-03-24:\n        Sum = 1.218+1.188+1.157+1.432+1.340+1.371+1.310+1.218+0.914+0.761+1.005+0.914+0.944+1.066+0.975+0.944+1.127+0.914+1.036+0.853+0.944+1.036+0.975+0.944\n        = 25.182\n        Average = 25.182/24 = 1.04925\n\n   Day4: 2017-03-25:\n        Sum = 0.853+0.853+0.822+0.761+0.792+0.792+0.670+0.883+1.249+1.310+1.279+1.188+0.975+1.005+1.097+0.975+1.036+0.975+0.792+0.731+0.853+0.761+0.761+0.761\n        = 22.114\n        Average = 22.114/24 = 0.9214167\n\n The daily averages are: 0.899, 1.053, 1.049, 0.921. There is no clear trend. So we can assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n Therefore, we can compute the hourly average over the 4 days and use that for the next 4 days.\n\n How to compute the hourly average?\n   For hour 0: (0.822 + 1.249 + 1.218 + 0.853) / 4 = (0.142) -> let me calculate:\n        0.822 + 1.249 = 2.071\n        +1.218 = 3.289\n        +0.853 = 4.142\n        average = 4.142 / 4 = 1.0355\n\n   Similarly for hour 1: (0.761+1.157+1.188+0.853) = 0.761+1.157=1.918; +1.188=3.106; +0.853=3.959; average=3.959/4=0.98975\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-29 23:00:00) will be:\n   Day1 (2017-03-26): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ..., hour23_avg]\n   Day2 (2017-03-27): same as above\n   Day3 (2017-03-28): same\n   Day4 (2017-03-29): same\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? However, we are only given 96 complete points. For the next 96, we are to produce the complete data. So we output 96 points without missing values.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the method above does not account for any trend or autocorrelation beyond the daily cycle. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable simple approach.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n Hour 0: (0.822, 1.249, 1.218, 0.853) -> 4.142 / 4 = 1.0355\n Hour 1: (0.761, 1.157, 1.188, 0.853) -> 3.959 / 4 = 0.98975\n Hour 2: (0.731, 1.310, 1.157, 0.822) -> 0.731+1.310=2.041; +1.157=3.198; +0.822=4.020; 4.020/4=1.005\n Hour 3: (0.761, 1.218, 1.432, 0.761) -> 0.761+1.218=1.979; +1.432=3.411; +0.761=4.172; 4.172/4=1.043\n Hour 4: (1.036, 1.432, 1.340, 0.792) -> 1.036+1.432=2.468; +1.340=3.808; +0.792=4.600; 4.600/4=1.15\n Hour 5: (0.853, 0.731, 1.371, 0.792) -> 0.853+0.731=1.584; +1.371=2.955; +0.792=3.747; 3.747/4=0.93675\n Hour 6: (0.761, 0.853, 1.310, 0.670) -> 0.761+0.853=1.614; +1.310=2.924; +0.670=3.594; 3.594/4=0.8985\n Hour 7: (0.914, 1.127, 1.218, 0.883) -> 0.914+1.127=2.041; +1.218=3.259; +0.883=4.142; 4.142/4=1.0355\n Hour 8: (1.097, 1.279, 0.914, 1.249) -> 1.097+1.279=2.376; +0.914=3.290; +1.249=4.539; 4.539/4=1.13475\n Hour 9: (1.279, 1.127, 0.761, 1.310) -> 1.279+1.127=2.406; +0.761=3.167; +1.310=4.477; 4.477/4=1.11925\n Hour 10: (1.005, 1.249, 1.005, 1.279) -> 1.005+1.249=2.254; +1.005=3.259; +1.279=4.538; 4.538/4=1.1345\n Hour 11: (1.097, 1.005, 0.914, 1.188) -> 1.097+1.005=2.102; +0.914=3.016; +1.188=4.204; 4.204/4=1.051\n Hour 12: (0.853, 0.883, 0.944, 0.975) -> 0.853+0.883=1.736; +0.944=2.680; +0.975=3.655; 3.655/4=0.91375\n Hour 13: (0.822, 1.127, 1.066, 1.005) -> 0.822+1.127=1.949; +1.066=3.015; +1.005=4.020; 4.020/4=1.005\n Hour 14: (0.914, 1.036, 0.975, 1.097) -> 0.914+1.036=1.950; +0.975=2.925; +1.097=4.022; 4.022/4=1.0055\n Hour 15: (0.944, 1.066, 0.944, 0.975) -> 0.944+1.066=2.010; +0.944=2.954; +0.975=3.929; 3.929/4=0.98225\n Hour 16: (0.914, 1.188, 1.127, 1.036) -> 0.914+1.188=2.102; +1.127=3.229; +1.036=4.265; 4.265/4=1.06625\n Hour 17: (0.975, 1.066, 0.914, 0.975) -> 0.975+1.066=2.041; +0.914=2.955; +0.975=3.930; 3.930/4=0.9825\n Hour 18: (0.944, 0.883, 1.036, 0.792) -> 0.944+0.883=1.827; +1.036=2.863; +0.792=3.655; 3.655/4=0.91375\n Hour 19: (0.914, 1.005, 0.853, 0.731) -> 0.914+1.005=1.919; +0.853=2.772; +0.731=3.503; 3.503/4=0.87575\n Hour 20: (0.975, 1.005, 0.944, 0.853) -> 0.975+1.005=1.980; +0.944=2.924; +0.853=3.777; 3.777/4=0.94425\n Hour 21: (0.975, 0.975, 1.036, 0.761) -> 0.975+0.975=1.950; +1.036=2.986; +0.761=3.747; 3.747/4=0.93675\n Hour 22: (0.883, 0.914, 0.975, 0.761) -> 0.883+0.914=1.797; +0.975=2.772; +0.761=3.533; 3.533/4=0.88325\n Hour 23: (0.548, 0.792, 0.944, 0.761) -> 0.548+0.792=1.340; +0.944=2.284; +0.761=3.045; 3.045/4=0.76125\n\n Now, we have 24 hourly averages. We will use these to form the next 4 days.\n\n The next 96 hours start from 2017-03-26 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-03-25 23:00:00).\n\n So:\n   Day 1: 2017-03-26\n        Hour 00:00:00 -> 1.0355\n        Hour 01:00:00 -> 0.98975\n        ... until hour 23:00:00 -> 0.76125\n\n   Day 2: 2017-03-27: same 24 values\n   Day 3: 2017-03-28: same\n   Day 4: 2017-03-29: same\n\n We must output the dates and the forecasted LULL.\n\n Format: \n        date (as datetime) and LULL (as float, with 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places, but we computed more. We'll round to 3 decimal places for consistency.)\n\n However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places, but we computed averages that might have more. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's round the hourly averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n Hour0: 1.0355 -> 1.036\n Hour1: 0.98975 -> 0.990\n Hour2: 1.005 -> 1.005\n Hour3: 1.043 -> 1.043\n Hour4: 1.15 -> 1.150\n Hour5: 0.93675 -> 0.937\n Hour6: 0.8985 -> 0.899\n Hour7: 1.0355 -> 1.036\n Hour8: 1.13475 -> 1.135\n Hour9: 1.11925 -> 1.119\n Hour10: 1.1345 -> 1.135\n Hour11: 1.051 -> 1.051\n Hour12: 0.91375 -> 0.914\n Hour13: 1.005 -> 1.005\n Hour14: 1.0055 -> 1.006\n Hour14: 1.0055 rounded to 3 decimals: 1.006 (since 1.0055 is exactly halfway? but in 3 decimals, we round to even? Actually, 1.0055 to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal: 1.006)\n Hour15: 0.98225 -> 0.982\n Hour16: 1.06625 -> 1.066\n Hour17: 0.9825 -> 0.983 (because 0.9825: the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal: 0.983)\n        But note: 0.9825 is exactly halfway? The rule: round to nearest even? However, common practice is to round 0.9825 to 0.983. But let me check: \n        Actually, 0.9825: \n          The digit in the thousandths place is 2, and the next digit is 5, so we round up the 2 to 3 -> 0.983.\n Hour18: 0.91375 -> 0.914\n Hour19: 0.87575 -> 0.876\n Hour20: 0.94425 -> 0.944\n Hour21: 0.93675 -> 0.937\n Hour22: 0.88325 -> 0.883 (because 0.88325: the 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5, so we leave as 0.883? \n        Actually, 0.88325: \n          The thousandths place is 3, and the next digit is 2 -> so we leave it as 0.883. But wait, 0.88325 has 3 decimal places: \n          We are rounding to 3 decimals: \n            0.88325 -> look at the 4th decimal (2) -> so we leave the 3rd decimal as 3 -> 0.883.\n        However, note: 0.88325 is 0.883 when rounded to 3 decimals? Actually, no: \n          The number is 0.88325, which is between 0.883 and 0.884. The 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5, so we round down -> 0.883.\n Hour23: 0.76125 -> 0.761\n\n But wait, let me double-check the rounding for a few:\n\n Hour1: 0.98975 -> \n        The 3rd decimal is 9, the 4th is 7 -> round up the 9 -> but 9 becomes 10, so we get 0.990.\n\n We'll do the rounding as above.\n\n However, note: the input data had values like 0.548, 0.761, etc. So we are consistent.\n\n Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n Start date: 2017-03-26 00:00:00\n Then 2017-03-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Day1: 2017-03-26: hours 0 to 23\n   Day2: 2017-03-27: hours 0 to 23\n   Day3: 2017-03-28: hours 0 to 23\n   Day4: 2017-03-29: hours 0 to 23\n\n And the LULL values for each day are the same 24 values (the rounded hourly averages we computed).\n\n Therefore, the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n 2017-03-26 00:00:00 1.036\n 2017-03-26 01:00:00 0.990\n 2017-03-26 02:00:00 1.005\n 2017-03-26 03:00:00 1.043\n 2017-03-26 04:00:00 1.150\n 2017-03-26 05:00:00 0.937\n 2017-03-26 06:00:00 0.899\n 2017-03-26 07:00:00 1.036\n 2017-03-26 08:00:00 1.135\n 2017-03-26 09:00:00 1.119\n 2017-03-26 10:00:00 1.135\n 2017-03-26 11:00:00 1.051\n 2017-03-26 12:00:00 0.914\n 2017-03-26 13:00:00 1.005\n 2017-03-26 14:00:00 1.006\n 2017-03-26 15:00:00 0.982\n 2017-03-26 16:00:00 1.066\n 2017-03-26 17:00:00 0.983\n 2017-03-26 18:00:00 0.914\n 2017-03-26 19:00:00 0.876\n 2017-03-26 20:00:00 0.944\n 2017-03-26 21:00:00 0.937\n 2017-03-26 22:00:00 0.883\n 2017-03-26 23:00:00 0.761\n\n Then repeat the same 24 values for the next three days.\n\n We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n But note: the dates must be consecutive and in the correct order.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-03-26 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 2017-03-29 23:00:00.\n\n We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n However, we must note: the last given date was 2017-03-25 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-03-26 00:00:00.\n\n We'll output in the same format: \n        date (as string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS') and LULL (as a number with 3 decimal places).\n\n We'll write the entire 96 points.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the rounding might have introduced slight inaccuracies, but it's acceptable.\n\n Let me write the 24-hour profile we are going to repeat:\n\n   [1.036, 0.990, 1.005, 1.043, 1.150, 0.937, 0.899, 1.036, 1.135, 1.119, 1.135, 1.051, 0.914, 1.005, 1.006, 0.982, 1.066, 0.983, 0.914, 0.876, 0.944, 0.937, 0.883, 0.761]\n\n We'll repeat this list 4 times.\n\n Now, we write the answer in the required format.\n\n Note: The answer must be enclosed in <answer> and </answer> tags, and the data in a code block (with triple backticks).\n\n We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-26 00:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-26 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-26 02:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-26 03:00:00 1.043\n2017-03-26 04:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-26 05:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-26 06:00:00 0.899\n2017-03-26 07:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-26 08:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-26 09:00:00 1.119\n2017-03-26 10:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-26 11:00:00 1.051\n2017-03-26 12:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-26 13:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-26 14:00:00 1.006\n2017-03-26 15:00:00 0.982\n2017-03-26 16:00:00 1.066\n2017-03-26 17:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-26 18:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-26 19:00:00 0.876\n2017-03-26 20:00:00 0.944\n2017-03-26 21:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-26 22:00:00 0.883\n2017-03-26 23:00:00 0.761\n2017-03-27 00:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-27 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-27 02:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-27 03:00:00 1.043\n2017-03-27 04:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-27 05:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-27 06:00:00 0.899\n2017-03-27 07:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-27 08:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-27 09:00:00 1.119\n2017-03-27 10:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-27 11:00:00 1.051\n2017-03-27 12:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-27 13:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-27 14:00:00 1.006\n2017-03-27 15:00:00 0.982\n2017-03-27 16:00:00 1.066\n2017-03-27 17:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-27 18:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-27 19:00:00 0.876\n2017-03-27 20:00:00 0.944\n2017-03-27 21:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-27 22:00:00 0.883\n2017-03-27 23:00:00 0.761\n2017-03-28 00:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-28 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-28 02:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-28 03:00:00 1.043\n2017-03-28 04:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-28 05:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-28 06:00:00 0.899\n2017-03-28 07:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-28 08:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-28 09:00:00 1.119\n2017-03-28 10:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-28 11:00:00 1.051\n2017-03-28 12:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-28 13:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-28 14:00:00 1.006\n2017-03-28 15:00:00 0.982\n2017-03-28 16:00:00 1.066\n2017-03-28 17:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-28 18:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-28 19:00:00 0.876\n2017-03-28 20:00:00 0.944\n2017-03-28 21:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-28 22:00:00 0.883\n2017-03-28 23:00:00 0.761\n2017-03-29 00:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-29 01:00:00 0.990\n2017-03-29 02:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-29 03:00:00 1.043\n2017-03-29 04:00:00 1.150\n2017-03-29 05:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-29 06:00:00 0.899\n2017-03-29 07:00:00 1.036\n2017-03-29 08:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-29 09:00:00 1.119\n2017-03-29 10:00:00 1.135\n2017-03-29 11:00:00 1.051\n2017-03-29 12:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-29 13:00:00 1.005\n2017-03-29 14:00:00 1.006\n2017-03-29 15:00:00 0.982\n2017-03-29 16:00:00 1.066\n2017-03-29 17:00:00 0.983\n2017-03-29 18:00:00 0.914\n2017-03-29 19:00:00 0.876\n2017-03-29 20:00:00 0.944\n2017-03-29 21:00:00 0.937\n2017-03-29 22:00:00 0.883\n2017-03-29 23:00:00 0.761\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the date format in the input was without the space?
