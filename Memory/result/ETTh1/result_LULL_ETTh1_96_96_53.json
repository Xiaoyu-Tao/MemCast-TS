        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) and also some level shifts and possible missing values (though the provided 96 points are complete).\n 2. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the future? But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? However, the provided 96 points are complete. \n    But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the entire dataset (which we are not given beyond 96 points) has missing values? \n    However, we are only given 96 points and they are complete. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is 4 days) and the data is hourly, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any, but from the data it seems stable with daily cycles)\n    - Seasonality: daily seasonality (24 hours)\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, note that the data has a step change on 2017-01-31 (all values become 0.457 for a whole day) \n    and then returns to a pattern similar to the first day on 2017-02-01. This might be an anomaly? But we have to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 5. Given the small data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n    - Using a simple approach: average the patterns of the available days? But the days are not exactly the same.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a time series model with seasonality. Let's try to decompose the series.\n\n 7. We are constrained by the fact that we must provide 96 points without any omission.\n\n 8. Approach:\n    - We'll use a SARIMA model. We note that the data has a seasonality of 24 hours.\n    - We can also consider using a naive seasonal method: using the last day (2017-02-01) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n      But the problem is that 2017-02-01 is a Wednesday? and we are going to forecast the next days which might be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday? \n      However, we don't have multiple weeks to capture weekly seasonality. We only have 4 days.\n\n 9. Given the limited data, we might use a simple average of the four days for each hour? But note the anomaly on 2017-01-31 (Tuesday) which was constant.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the median of the same hour for the available days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 11. Let's check the data:\n\n      Day 1 (2017-01-29, Sunday?): \n        pattern: starts at 0.426, then drops to 0.366, then rises to 0.548 and then falls to 0.487.\n\n      Day 2 (2017-01-30, Monday?): \n        similar pattern but with higher peak (0.579) and ends at 0.487.\n\n      Day 3 (2017-01-31, Tuesday?): \n        constant 0.457 all day. This is an anomaly? or a holiday? \n\n      Day 4 (2017-02-01, Wednesday?): \n        pattern: starts at 0.457, then drops to 0.335, then rises to 0.579 and then falls to 0.426.\n\n 12. Since we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality and the Tuesday is an anomaly, we might consider excluding the anomaly day? \n     But the problem says we must forecast the next 96 points. We cannot omit.\n\n 13. We can use a model that is robust to such anomalies? Or we can use the median for each hour of the non-anomaly days? But we have only 3 non-anomaly days? \n\n 14. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any missing. So we can proceed.\n\n 15. We decide to use the median of the same hour for the three non-anomaly days (excluding 2017-01-31) for the forecast? \n     But what if the next days include a Tuesday? We don't know. We are forecasting from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-01) as the pattern for the next day? and then repeat it? But that would ignore the weekly pattern? \n     However, we don't have enough data for weekly pattern.\n\n 17. Given the constraints, we will use a simple method: \n     - We note that the data on 2017-01-31 is an anomaly. We will use the data from the other three days (2017-01-29, 2017-01-30, 2017-02-01) to compute the median for each hour.\n\n 18. Steps for the median method:\n      - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the values from the three days (excluding 2017-01-31) and compute the median.\n      - Then we repeat this pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 19. Why median? Because it is robust to outliers. The day 2017-01-31 is an anomaly and we are excluding it. The other three days are used.\n\n 20. How to handle the fact that 2017-01-29 is a Sunday, 2017-01-30 Monday, and 2017-02-01 Wednesday? We don't have Tuesday? \n     But we are excluding Tuesday because it was an anomaly. We are going to use the same pattern for every day? \n\n 21. This might be acceptable because we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality.\n\n 22. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: [0.426 (Sun), 0.426 (Mon), 0.457 (Wed)] -> sorted: 0.426, 0.426, 0.457 -> median = 0.426\n      Hour 1: [0.366, 0.366, 0.457] -> sorted: 0.366, 0.366, 0.457 -> median = 0.366\n      Hour 2: [0.366, 0.366, 0.426] -> sorted: 0.366, 0.366, 0.426 -> median = 0.366\n      Hour 3: [0.366, 0.335, 0.335] -> sorted: 0.335, 0.335, 0.366 -> median = 0.335\n      Hour 4: [0.335, 0.335, 0.335] -> sorted: 0.335, 0.335, 0.335 -> median = 0.335\n      Hour 5: [0.366, 0.366, 0.366] -> median = 0.366\n      Hour 6: [0.366, 0.366, 0.366] -> median = 0.366\n      Hour 7: [0.396, 0.426, 0.426] -> sorted: 0.396, 0.426, 0.426 -> median = 0.426\n      Hour 8: [0.426, 0.426, 0.457] -> sorted: 0.426, 0.426, 0.457 -> median = 0.426\n      Hour 9: [0.426, 0.426, 0.457] -> median = 0.426\n      Hour 10: [0.396, 0.426, 0.457] -> sorted: 0.396, 0.426, 0.457 -> median = 0.426\n      Hour 11: [0.426, 0.426, 0.487] -> sorted: 0.426, 0.426, 0.487 -> median = 0.426\n      Hour 12: [0.457, 0.396, 0.457] -> sorted: 0.396, 0.457, 0.457 -> median = 0.457\n      Hour 13: [0.457, 0.396, 0.457] -> sorted: 0.396, 0.457, 0.457 -> median = 0.457\n      Hour 14: [0.457, 0.457, 0.487] -> sorted: 0.457, 0.457, 0.487 -> median = 0.457\n      Hour 15: [0.487, 0.487, 0.487] -> median = 0.487\n      Hour 16: [0.487, 0.457, 0.487] -> sorted: 0.457, 0.487, 0.487 -> median = 0.487\n      Hour 17: [0.457, 0.457, 0.518] -> sorted: 0.457, 0.457, 0.518 -> median = 0.457\n      Hour 18: [0.487, 0.518, 0.518] -> sorted: 0.487, 0.518, 0.518 -> median = 0.518\n      Hour 19: [0.518, 0.548, 0.548] -> sorted: 0.518, 0.548, 0.548 -> median = 0.548\n      Hour 20: [0.548, 0.579, 0.579] -> sorted: 0.548, 0.579, 0.579 -> median = 0.579\n      Hour 21: [0.518, 0.579, 0.548] -> sorted: 0.518, 0.548, 0.579 -> median = 0.548\n      Hour 22: [0.487, 0.548, 0.518] -> sorted: 0.487, 0.518, 0.548 -> median = 0.518\n      Hour 23: [0.487, 0.487, 0.426] -> sorted: 0.426, 0.487, 0.487 -> median = 0.487\n\n 23. Now, we will create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 24. The forecast will start from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 26. However, note: the last given timestamp is 2017-02-01 23:00:00. The next one is 2017-02-02 00:00:00.\n\n 27. We create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-02-02\n        00:00:00 -> 0.426\n        01:00:00 -> 0.366\n        02:00:00 -> 0.366\n        03:00:00 -> 0.335\n        04:00:00 -> 0.335\n        05:00:00 -> 0.366\n        06:00:00 -> 0.366\n        07:00:00 -> 0.426\n        08:00:00 -> 0.426\n        09:00:00 -> 0.426\n        10:00:00 -> 0.426\n        11:00:00 -> 0.426\n        12:00:00 -> 0.457\n        13:00:00 -> 0.457\n        14:00:00 -> 0.457\n        15:00:00 -> 0.487\n        16:00:00 -> 0.487\n        17:00:00 -> 0.457\n        18:00:00 -> 0.518\n        19:00:00 -> 0.548\n        20:00:00 -> 0.579\n        21:00:00 -> 0.548\n        22:00:00 -> 0.518\n        23:00:00 -> 0.487\n\n      Then repeat the same pattern for the next three days.\n\n 28. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? However, we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 29. We output the next 96 points in the required format.\n\n 30. However, note: the median method might not be the most sophisticated, but given the data and the anomaly, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 31. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 32. Let's generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-02-02 00:00:00\n      Then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 33. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 34. The pattern for 24 hours (as above) and then repeat 4 times.\n\n 35. Code for the dates:\n\n      from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n      start = datetime(2017, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0)\n      dates = [start + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 36. But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n 37. We write the data in the same format as the input: two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'\n\n 38. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 39. We note: the median values for each hour (0-23) as computed above.\n\n 40. We write the next 96 points.\n\n 41. Example for the first day:\n\n      2017-02-02 00:00:00 0.426\n      2017-02-02 01:00:00 0.366\n      ... until 2017-02-02 23:00:00 0.487\n\n      Then the next day (2017-02-03) same pattern: \n      2017-02-03 00:00:00 0.426\n      ... and so on.\n\n 42. We output the entire 96 points.\n\n 43. We note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 44. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 45. Let's do it.\n",
