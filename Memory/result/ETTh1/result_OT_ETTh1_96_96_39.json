        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-12-04 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values. \n    However, in the provided data, we don't have missing values. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a clear daily seasonality (with temperatures dropping at night and rising during the day) and also a downward trend in the given 4 days (from around 17 to negative and then back up a bit), we need a model that can capture seasonality and trend.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement for 96 steps, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality. However, without the ability to run code, we must rely on a heuristic or a simple method.\n\n 4. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. Since we are only given 96 points without missing values, we assume that for forecasting we can use the complete provided data.\n\n 5. However, the problem also says that the next 96 might have missing values? Actually, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". \n    But in the context, it might mean that the provided data for the past 96 might have missing values? But in the example, we don't. \n\n    Since we are to forecast the next 96, and we are to provide the complete data (without missing values) for the next 96, we must generate 96 values without any missing.\n\n 6. Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models. We can use a simple method:\n\n    - We observe the last 24 hours (from 2016-12-07 00:00:00 to 2016-12-07 23:00:00) and note the pattern.\n\n    The last day (2016-12-07) data:\n        00:00:00 -3.025000\n        01:00:00 -3.166000\n        02:00:00 -3.377000\n        03:00:00 -3.517000\n        04:00:00 -3.939000\n        05:00:00 -4.080000\n        06:00:00 -4.010000\n        07:00:00 -4.010000\n        08:00:00 -3.939000\n        09:00:00 -2.181000\n        10:00:00  0.000000\n        11:00:00  1.266000\n        12:00:00  2.181000\n        13:00:00  3.447000\n        14:00:00  3.799000\n        15:00:00  3.588000\n        16:00:00  3.236000\n        17:00:00  2.321000\n        18:00:00  1.266000\n        19:00:00  0.915000\n        20:00:00  1.266000\n        21:00:00  4.080000\n        22:00:00  6.261000\n        23:00:00  7.668000\n\n    We see that the temperature starts very low (negative) and then rises during the day, and then drops again? Actually, on 2016-12-07, the temperature kept rising until 14:00 (3.799) and then started to drop until 19:00 (0.915) and then rose again at 20:00 and 21:00-23:00.\n\n    However, looking at the previous days, the pattern is not exactly the same. The temperature on 2016-12-05 and 2016-12-06 was very low and then started to rise on 2016-12-07.\n\n 7. Since we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) and we have 4 days of history, we can try to capture the daily seasonality and the trend.\n\n    The overall trend: \n        The first day (2016-12-04) had temperatures mostly above 15, then dropped to negative on 2016-12-06 and then started to recover on 2016-12-07.\n\n    We might assume that the trend is increasing because the last day (2016-12-07) ended at 7.668, which is higher than the previous days.\n\n 8. A simple approach: \n    - Use the last day (24 hours) as a base and then adjust by a trend factor.\n\n    However, note that the temperature on 2016-12-07 was increasing. We can project that the next days will be similar to the last day but with an upward shift.\n\n    How much shift? We can compute the difference between the same hour of the previous days? But the pattern is changing.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the level and then add the seasonal component.\n\n    We can decompose the series into level, trend, and seasonality.\n\n    Since we have only 96 points, we can compute:\n\n        level: we can take the average of the last 24 hours? or use the last value? \n\n    But note: the data has a clear daily pattern (seasonality of 24 hours).\n\n 10. We can use a naive method: \n        Forecast for the next 24 hours (day 5) = last 24 hours (day 4) + (day4 - day3) difference? \n\n     But the difference between day4 and day3:\n\n        Day3: 2016-12-06 (from 00:00 to 23:00) -> mostly negative, then some positive in the middle.\n        Day4: 2016-12-07 -> started negative and then rose to positive.\n\n     The difference between day4 and day3 at the same hour:\n\n        For example, at 00:00: \n            day3: 0.633000 -> became -3.025000 on day4? That doesn't look additive.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to form the next day? But the trend is changing.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and without running a model, we can assume that the temperature will continue the pattern of the last day but with a slight upward trend.\n\n    We can set:\n        Forecast for hour h of day5 (2016-12-08) = value of hour h of day4 (2016-12-07) + (value of hour h of day4 - value of hour h of day3)\n\n    But then for day6: similarly, we can use the same method? \n\n    However, note that the difference between day4 and day3 might be too large and not sustainable.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a linear trend for the level and then add the seasonal component.\n\n    We can compute the average for each day:\n\n        Day1 (2016-12-04): average of 24 hours: around (17.657+15.969+...+18.009)/24 -> let's roughly calculate: \n            The values are mostly in the teens -> average around 17? (exact calculation not possible here)\n\n        Day2 (2016-12-05): from 17.587 down to 1.337 and then 0 and negative -> average is low, maybe around 5?\n        Day3 (2016-12-06): from 0.633 to -2.884 -> average negative, around -1?\n        Day4 (2016-12-07): from -3.025 to 7.668 -> average around 1?\n\n        The daily averages: [17, 5, -1, 1] -> we see a trend: 17, then 5 (drop of 12), then -1 (drop of 6), then 1 (rise of 2). \n\n        The trend is not linear. But the last two days show a recovery.\n\n    We can fit a linear trend to the last two days? or use exponential smoothing.\n\n 14. Given the time and the requirement to produce 96 values, we can do:\n\n        Let the daily average for the next 4 days be: \n            day5: 1 + (1 - (-1)) = 3?  -> but that might be too simplistic.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the trend from the last two days: \n            from day3 to day4: from -1 to 1 -> increase of 2 per day.\n\n        So for the next 4 days: \n            day5: 1 + 2 = 3\n            day6: 3 + 2 = 5\n            day7: 5 + 2 = 7\n            day8: 7 + 2 = 9\n\n        Then for each hour, we take the seasonal component from the last day (day4) and adjust by the daily level.\n\n        How? \n            Let S_h be the value at hour h on day4.\n            The average of day4 is 1 (we don't have the exact average, but we can compute it).\n\n        Actually, we can compute the average of day4 (2016-12-07) exactly from the 24 values:\n\n            Sum = (-3.025) + (-3.166) + ... + 7.668\n\n            We can approximate: \n                The negative part: from 00:00 to 10:00 (11 hours) are negative, then positive for 13 hours.\n                The negative values: around -3 to -4 -> average about -3.5 for 11 hours -> total -38.5\n                The positive: from 0 to 7.668 -> average about 3.5 for 13 hours -> total 45.5\n                Total = -38.5 + 45.5 = 7, then average = 7/24 \u2248 0.29\n\n        So the average of day4 is about 0.29.\n\n        Then for day5, we want the average to be 3. So we add (3 - 0.29) = 2.71 to every hour of day4 to get day5.\n\n        Similarly, for day6: we add (5 - 0.29) = 4.71 to every hour of day4.\n\n        For day7: add (7 - 0.29)=6.71\n        For day8: add (9 - 0.29)=8.71\n\n        But note: the daily pattern might change? We are assuming the same shape.\n\n 15. However, the problem is that the last day (day4) had a very cold morning and then a warm afternoon. If the trend is increasing, the next days might have less cold mornings and warmer afternoons? \n\n     But our method adds a constant to the entire day.\n\n 16. We can try to compute the seasonal indices by averaging each hour over the 4 days? But we only have 4 days and the trend is strong, so it might not be stationary.\n\n 17. Given the time, we will use the above method.\n\n     Steps for forecasting:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average of each of the 4 days.\n\n        We have the data, so we can compute:\n\n            Day1: 2016-12-04: \n                We have 24 values: \n                Let me compute the sum: \n                    17.657+15.969+17.305+17.938+18.361+18.290001+18.219999+18.219999+18.572001+17.375999+17.305+16.954+16.601999+18.009001+17.235001+16.108999+16.672001+18.572001+17.305+17.798+17.938+17.516001+17.868+18.009001\n\n                This is tedious, but we can approximate: \n                    Most values are between 16 and 18 -> average around 17.5? \n\n                Actually, let's do a rough: \n                    18*10 = 180, 17*10=170, 16*4=64 -> total 180+170+64=414? then 414/24=17.25\n\n            Day2: 2016-12-05: \n                Starts at 17.587 and goes down to 1.337 and then negative? \n                We can see: \n                    First 10 hours: from 17.587 to 12.451 -> average about 15? \n                    Then drops to 10.482, 11.889, 9.708, 8.864, 7.527, 4.573, 3.236, 2.884, 2.040, 1.829, 1.337, 0.633, 0, -0.633, ... until -2.884 at 23:00.\n\n                This is hard to compute exactly without a calculator. We can use the fact that the day started at 17.587 and ended at 1.337? but that's not the whole day.\n\n                Actually, the day has 24 hours: \n                    The first 12 hours: 12 values: \n                        17.587, 16.813, 17.094, 15.758, 16.108999, 15.336, 16.954, 17.516001, 15.406, 15.336, 12.874, 12.451 -> average about 15.5?\n                    The next 12 hours: \n                        10.482, 11.889, 11.678, 9.708, 8.864, 7.527, 4.573, 3.236, 2.884, 2.040, 1.829, 1.337 -> average about 7?\n\n                    Total average: (15.5*12 + 7*12)/24 = (186+84)/24 = 270/24 = 11.25\n\n            Day3: 2016-12-06: \n                Starts at 0.633 and goes to -2.884\n                Values: \n                    0.633,0,-0.633,-1.548,-2.110,-2.462,-3.025,-3.236,-2.955,-1.759,-0.985,0.492,0,0,0,0,0,0.844,-0.774,-1.407,-1.759,-2.110,-2.673,-2.884\n\n                Sum = \n                    positive: 0.633+0.492+0.844 = 1.969\n                    negative: -0.633-1.548-2.110-2.462-3.025-3.236-2.955-1.759-0.985-0.774-1.407-1.759-2.110-2.673-2.884 = \n                    Let's add: \n                        - (0.633+1.548+2.884) = -5.065\n                        - (2.110+2.462+3.025+3.236) = -10.833\n                        - (2.955+1.759+0.985) = -5.699\n                        - (0.774+1.407+1.759+2.110+2.673) = -8.723\n                    Total negative = -(5.065+10.833+5.699+8.723) = -30.32\n                    Total = 1.969 - 30.32 = -28.351\n                    average = -28.351/24 \u2248 -1.18\n\n            Day4: 2016-12-07: \n                Values: \n                    -3.025, -3.166, -3.377, -3.517, -3.939, -4.080, -4.010, -4.010, -3.939, -2.181, 0, 1.266, 2.181, 3.447, 3.799, 3.588, 3.236, 2.321, 1.266, 0.915, 1.266, 4.080, 6.261, 7.668\n\n                Sum = \n                    negative part (first 9 hours): \n                        -3.025-3.166-3.377-3.517-3.939-4.080-4.010-4.010-3.939 = \n                        = - (3.025+3.166+3.377+3.517+3.939+4.080+4.010+4.010+3.939) \n                        = - (let's add: 3+3.2+3.4+3.5+3.9+4.1+4.0+4.0+3.9) = - (3+3.2=6.2; 6.2+3.4=9.6; 9.6+3.5=13.1; 13.1+3.9=17; 17+4.1=21.1; 21.1+4.0=25.1; 25.1+4.0=29.1; 29.1+3.9=33) -> -33\n                    positive part (next 15 hours): \n                        0+1.266+2.181+3.447+3.799+3.588+3.236+2.321+1.266+0.915+1.266+4.080+6.261+7.668\n                        = 1.266+2.181=3.447; +3.447=6.894; +3.799=10.693; +3.588=14.281; +3.236=17.517; +2.321=19.838; +1.266=21.104; +0.915=22.019; +1.266=23.285; +4.080=27.365; +6.261=33.626; +7.668=41.294\n                    Total = -33 + 41.294 = 8.294\n                    average = 8.294/24 \u2248 0.3456\n\n        So the daily averages: \n            Day1: 17.25\n            Day2: 11.25\n            Day3: -1.18\n            Day4: 0.3456\n\n        The trend: \n            Day1 to Day2: 11.25 - 17.25 = -6\n            Day2 to Day3: -1.18 - 11.25 = -12.43\n            Day3 to Day4: 0.3456 - (-1.18) = 1.5256\n\n        The last trend is positive. We can take the average trend over the last 3 intervals? \n            (-6 -12.43 + 1.5256)/3 = (-16.9044)/3 \u2248 -5.6348 -> that doesn't look right.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the last change: +1.5256 per day.\n\n        We'll assume the next 4 days will have an increase of about 1.5 per day.\n\n        So:\n            Day5: 0.3456 + 1.5 = 1.8456\n            Day6: 1.8456 + 1.5 = 3.3456\n            Day7: 3.3456 + 1.5 = 4.8456\n            Day8: 4.8456 + 1.5 = 6.3456\n\n        Then for each hour h in [0,23] for the next 4 days:\n\n            Forecast for day5, hour h = (day4 at hour h) + (1.8456 - 0.3456) = day4 at hour h + 1.5\n            Forecast for day6, hour h = day4 at hour h + (3.3456 - 0.3456) = day4 at hour h + 3.0\n            Forecast for day7, hour h = day4 at hour h + (4.8456 - 0.3456) = day4 at hour h + 4.5\n            Forecast for day8, hour h = day4 at hour h + (6.3456 - 0.3456) = day4 at hour h + 6.0\n\n        This will give us 96 values.\n\n 18. But note: the last day (day4) had a very cold night and morning) and a warm afternoon. Adding a constant might make the cold hours less cold and the warm hours warmer.\n\n 19. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day5: 2016-12-08 00:00:00: -3.025 + 1.5 = -1.525\n               01:00:00: -3.166 + 1.5 = -1.666\n               ... until 23:00: 7.668+1.5=9.168\n\n        Day6: 2016-12-09 00:00:00: -3.025 + 3.0 = -0.025\n               ... 23:00: 7.668+3.0=10.668\n\n        Day7: 2016-12-10 00:00:00: -3.025+4.5=1.475\n               ... 23:00: 7.668+4.5=12.168\n\n        Day8: 2016-12-11 00:00:00: -3.025+6.0=2.975\n               ... 23:00: 7.668+6.0=13.668\n\n 20. We must output the dates and the forecasted OT.\n\n     The last date in the input is 2016-12-07 23:00:00.\n\n     The next 96 hours:\n\n        2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n\n 21.

We must be cautious: the data provided for the last day (2016-12-07) has 24 values. We'll use them in order.\n\n 23. Let's list the 24 values for 2016-12-07:\n\n        h0: -3.025\n        h1: -3.166\n        h2: -3.377\n        h3: -3.517\n        h4: -3.939\n        h5: -4.080\n        h6: -4.010\n        h7: -4.010\n        h8: -3.939\n        h9: -2.181\n        h10: 0.000\n        h11: 1.266\n        h12: 2.181\n        h13: 3.447\n        h14: 3.799\n        h15: 3.588\n        h16: 3.236\n        h17: 2.321\n        h18: 1.266\n        h19: 0.915\n        h20: 1.266\n        h21: 4.080\n        h22: 6.261\n        h23: 7.668\n\n 24.
