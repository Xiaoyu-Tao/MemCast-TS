        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing entries (every hour is present). So we assume the data is complete for the past.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data, we can consider a time series model that captures daily seasonality (24-hour pattern).\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast, we can use a model that handles seasonality. Since we are in a constrained environment without the ability to run complex model training, we can use a simple but effective method: \n    - We can use the seasonal component from the last available cycle (last 24 hours) and adjust it with a trend if necessary.\n\n 4. However, looking at the data, there is a clear daily pattern (with values becoming more negative during the day and recovering at night). But the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n 5. We can try to decompose the series and then forecast the components. But without being able to run extensive code, we can use a naive seasonal approach:\n\n    Option: \n      - We take the last 24 hours (2017-09-05 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00) and use that as the base pattern for the next days.\n\n    However, we note that the level of the series might be changing. We can adjust by the average change between consecutive days.\n\n 6. Let's compute the average of each day:\n\n    2017-09-02: from 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 points\n    2017-09-03: 24 points\n    2017-09-04: 24 points\n    2017-09-05: 24 points\n\n    We can compute the daily averages and then the trend in these averages.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average to detrend and then forecast the seasonal component.\n\n 8. Given the simplicity required and the fact that we are to provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n    - Calculate the daily average for the last 4 days and then compute the average daily trend (the difference between consecutive days).\n    - Then, for the next 4 days, we set the daily average as the last day's average plus the average trend multiplied by the day index (1,2,3,4).\n    - Then, for each hour in the day, we take the corresponding hour from the last day (2017-09-05) and adjust it by the difference in the daily average.\n\n    However, note that the last day (2017-09-05) might be the most relevant.\n\n 9. Another approach: use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days and then adjust by a linear trend? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will use a method that uses the last day's pattern and then adjusts by the overall trend of the last 4 days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n   a) Compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-02): avg1 = mean of the 24 values on 2017-09-02\n        Day2 (2017-09-03): avg2\n        Day3 (2017-09-04): avg3\n        Day4 (2017-09-05): avg4\n\n   b) Compute the daily changes: \n        diff1 = avg2 - avg1\n        diff2 = avg3 - avg2\n        diff3 = avg4 - avg3\n\n        average_daily_change = (diff1 + diff2 + diff3) / 3\n\n   c) Then, the forecasted daily averages for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) would be:\n\n        avg5 = avg4 + average_daily_change\n        avg6 = avg4 + 2 * average_daily_change\n        avg7 = avg4 + 3 * average_daily_change\n        avg8 = avg4 + 4 * average_daily_change\n\n   d) For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have a base value from the last day (2017-09-05). We adjust each hour by the difference between the forecasted daily average and the last day's average.\n\n        Let H_last[i] be the value at hour i on 2017-09-05.\n        Then for the next day (first forecast day, 2017-09-06) at hour i:\n            forecast = H_last[i] + (avg5 - avg4)\n\n        Similarly, for the second day (2017-09-07) at hour i:\n            forecast = H_last[i] + (avg6 - avg4)\n\n        And so on.\n\n 11. However, note that the pattern might not be additive. Alternatively, we can use a multiplicative adjustment? But the data has negative values so multiplicative might not be suitable.\n\n 12. We'll stick to additive.\n\n 13. But wait, what if the daily pattern is changing? We might also consider the average pattern of the last 4 days? But the last day is the most recent and might be the most relevant.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days and then add the trend? But that would smooth out the pattern.\n\n 15. Given the short history, we are forecasting 4 days, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the trend.\n\n 16. Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-02): \n            values: [-0.462, -0.924, -2.061] ... (24 values)\n            avg1 = (-0.462 -0.924 -0.604 -1.919 -0.924 -1.528 -1.564 -1.599 -1.528 -1.777 -1.990 -2.097 -2.416 -2.416 -1.990 -2.203 -2.630 -3.020 -3.127 -3.340 -3.305 -3.340 -2.736 -2.061) \n            We can compute: \n                sum = -0.462 -0.924 -2.061 ... (we don't compute by hand, but we can note that the values are negative and the average should be around -2.0)\n\n        Instead, we can write a small code in mind? But we are not running code. We have to do it manually? \n\n        Since we are an expert, we can approximate:\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid exact calculation and use the method without the daily averages? \n\n 17. We can use a simpler method: use the last 24 hours as the pattern and then adjust by the average of the last 3 daily changes in the overall level at the same hour? \n\n 18. Another idea: use a naive seasonal forecast: \n        forecast for the next 24 hours = the values of the previous 24 hours (i.e., 2017-09-05) \n        then the next 24 hours = the values of 2017-09-05 again? \n\n     But that ignores any trend.\n\n 19. We can compute the average of the entire series and then the average of the last 24 hours? \n\n 20. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide an answer, we will use the following:\n\n     We note that the data shows a clear daily pattern and a slight trend? Let's check the daily averages roughly:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-02: \n            The values range from -0.462 to -3.340 -> average around -2.0? \n            Let's add: \n                The first 6 hours: -0.462, -0.924, -0.604, -1.919, -0.924, -1.528 -> sum = -6.361\n                Then 6 hours: -1.564, -1.599, -1.528, -1.777, -1.990, -2.097 -> sum = -10.555\n                Then 6 hours: -2.416, -2.416, -1.990, -2.203, -2.630, -3.020 -> sum = -14.675\n                Then 6 hours: -3.127, -3.340, -3.305, -3.340, -2.736, -2.061 -> sum = -17.909\n                Total = -6.361 -10.555 -14.675 -17.909 = -49.5\n                avg1 = -49.5 / 24 = -2.0625\n\n        Day2: 2017-09-03:\n            First 6: -0.782, -1.102, -1.528, -1.777, -0.355, -1.635 -> sum = -7.179\n            Next 6: -2.025, -1.386, -2.132, -1.848, -1.990, -2.416 -> sum = -11.797\n            Next 6: -2.843, -2.701, -2.487, -2.168, -2.487, -2.878 -> sum = -15.564\n            Last 6: -3.411, -3.447, -3.376, -3.198, -1.706, -0.817 -> sum = -15.955\n            Total = -7.179 -11.797 -15.564 -15.955 = -50.495\n            avg2 = -50.495 / 24 = -2.10396\n\n        Day3: 2017-09-04:\n            First 6: -0.284, -0.284, -0.462, -0.853, -0.995, -0.569 -> sum = -3.447\n            Next 6: -2.132, -1.102, -0.924, -1.599, -1.421, -1.990 -> sum = -9.168\n            Next 6: -2.878, -1.173, -1.528, -1.919, -2.452, -2.949 -> sum = -12.899\n            Last 6: -3.482, -3.589, -3.340, -3.340, -3.092, -1.599 -> sum = -18.442\n            Total = -3.447 -9.168 -12.899 -18.442 = -43.956\n            avg3 = -43.956 / 24 = -1.8315\n\n        Day4: 2017-09-05:\n            First 6: -1.208, -1.350, -1.492, -1.031, -1.812, -0.959 -> sum = -7.852\n            Next 6: -2.949, -0.569, -1.919, -1.279, -1.244, -1.315 -> sum = -9.275\n            Next 6: -1.350, 0.036, -0.782, -1.848, -1.954, -2.310 -> sum = -8.208\n            Last 6: -2.772, -2.559, -2.701, -2.345, -1.564, -1.670 -> sum = -13.611\n            Total = -7.852 -9.275 -8.208 -13.611 = -38.946\n            avg4 = -38.946 / 24 = -1.62275\n\n     Now, the daily changes:\n        diff1 = avg2 - avg1 = -2.10396 - (-2.0625) = -0.04146\n        diff2 = avg3 - avg2 = -1.8315 - (-2.10396) = 0.27246\n        diff3 = avg4 - avg3 = -1.62275 - (-1.8315) = 0.20875\n\n        average_daily_change = (-0.04146 + 0.27246 + 0.20875) / 3 = (0.43975) / 3 = 0.14658\n\n     Then the next days:\n        avg5 = avg4 + average_daily_change = -1.62275 + 0.14658 = -1.47617\n        avg6 = avg4 + 2 * average_daily_change = -1.62275 + 0.29316 = -1.32959\n        avg7 = avg4 + 3 * average_daily_change = -1.62275 + 0.43974 = -1.18301\n        avg8 = avg4 + 4 * average_daily_change = -1.62275 + 0.58632 = -1.03643\n\n     Now, we adjust the last day (2017-09-05) pattern by the difference between the forecasted average and the last day's average.\n\n        For day5 (2017-09-06): \n            adjustment = avg5 - avg4 = -1.47617 - (-1.62275) = 0.14658\n            So for each hour i in 00:00 to 23:00 of 2017-09-05, we add 0.14658 to get the forecast for the same hour on 2017-09-06.\n\n        Similarly, for day6 (2017-09-07): \n            adjustment = avg6 - avg4 = -1.32959 - (-1.62275) = 0.29316\n\n        For day7 (2017-09-08): \n            adjustment = 0.43974\n\n        For day8 (2017-09-09): \n            adjustment = 0.58632\n\n 21. Now, we take the last day (2017-09-05) data:\n\n        hour00: -1.208 -> for 2017-09-06 00:00:00: -1.208 + 0.14658 = -1.06142\n        hour01: -1.350 -> -1.350 + 0.14658 = -1.20342\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. But note: the trend we computed is positive (increasing the value, making it less negative) and the data seems to be increasing (becoming less negative) over the 4 days.\n\n 23. We'll generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 24. However, note that the data provided for 2017-09-05 is:\n\n        2017-09-05 00:00:00 -1.208\n        2017-09-05 01:00:00 -1.350\n        2017-09-05 02:00:00 -1.492\n        2017-09-05 03:00:00 -1.031\n        2017-09-05 04:00:00 -1.812\n        2017-09-05 05:00:00 -0.959\n        2017-09-05 06:00:00 -2.949\n        2017-09-05 07:00:00 -0.569\n        2017-09-05 08:00:00 -1.919\n        2017-09-05 09:00:00 -1.279\n        2017-09-05 10:00:00 -1.244\n        2017-09-05 11:00:00 -1.315\n        2017-09-05 12:00:00 -1.350\n        2017-09-05 13:00:00  0.036\n        2017-09-05 14:00:00 -0.782\n        2017-09-05 15:00:00 -1.848\n        2017-09-05 16:00:00 -1.954\n        2017-09-05 17:00:00 -2.310\n        2017-09-05 18:00:00 -2.772\n        2017-09-05 19:00:00 -2.559\n        2017-09-05 20:00:00 -2.701\n        2017-09-05 21:00:00 -2.345\n        2017-09-05 22:00:00 -1.564\n        2017-09-05 23:00:00 -1.670\n\n 25. We will generate:\n\n        Day5: 2017-09-06: each value = value of 2017-09-05 at same hour + 0.14658\n        Day6: 2017-09-07: each value = value of 2017-09-05 at same hour + 0.29316\n        Day7: 2017-09-08: each value = value of 2017-09-05 at same hour + 0.43974\n        Day8: 2017-09-09: each value = value of 2017-09-05 at same hour + 0.58632\n\n 26. We must note: the adjustment is additive and constant per day.\n\n 27. We output the next 96 points (4 days) in the same format.\n\n 28. We must be cautious: the data has negative values and we are adding a positive number, so the values become less negative.\n\n 29. Let's compute the first few:\n\n        For 2017-09-06 00:00:00: -1.208 + 0.14658 = -1.06142\n        For 2017-09-06 01:00:00: -1.350 + 0.14658 = -1.20342\n        For 2017-09-06 02:00:00: -1.492 + 0.14658 = -1.34542\n        For 2017-09-06 03:00:00: -1.031 + 0.14658 = -0.88442\n        For 2017-09-06 04:00:00: -1.812 + 0.14658 = -1.66542\n        For 2017-09-06 05:00:00: -0.959 + 0.14658 = -0.81242\n        For 2017-09-06 06:00:00: -2.949 + 0.14658 = -2.80242\n        ... and so on.\n\n 30. We do the same for the next days.\n\n 31. We must output the dates as well, starting from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00.\n\n 32.

However, the adjustment values are small and we must be careful with rounding.\n\n 36. We'll compute each value and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. We must generate 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n 38. Let's do the first day (2017-09-06) with adjustment 0.14658:\n\n        hour00: -1.208 + 0.14658 = -1.06142 -> -1.061\n        hour01: -1.350 + 0.14658 = -1.20342 -> -1.203\n        hour02: -1.492 + 0.14658 = -1.34542 -> -1.345\n        hour03: -1.031 + 0.14658 = -0.88442 -> -0.884\n        hour04: -1.812 + 0.14658 = -1.66542 -> -1.665\n        hour05: -0.959 + 0.14658 = -0.81242 -> -0.812\n        hour06: -2.949 + 0.14658 = -2.80242 -> -2.802\n        hour07: -0.569 + 0.14658 = -0.42242 -> -0.422\n        hour08: -1.919 + 0.14658 = -1.77242 -> -1.772\n        hour09: -1.279 + 0.14658 = -1.13242 -> -1.132\n        hour10: -1.244 + 0.14658 = -1.09742 -> -1.097\n        hour11: -1.315 + 0.14658 = -1.16842 -> -1.168\n        hour12: -1.350 + 0.14658 = -1.20342 -> -1.203\n        hour13:  0.036 + 0.14658 =  0.18258 ->  0.183\n        hour14: -0.782 + 0.14658 = -0.63542 -> -0.635\n        hour15: -1.848 + 0.14658 = -1.70142 -> -1.701\n        hour16: -1.954 + 0.14658 = -1.80742 -> -1.807\n        hour17: -2.310 + 0.14658 = -2.16342 -> -2.163\n        hour18: -2.772 + 0.14658 = -2.62542 -> -2.625\n        hour19: -2.559 + 0.14658 = -2.41242 -> -2.412\n        hour20: -2.701 + 0.14658 = -2.55442 -> -2.554\n        hour21: -2.345 + 0.14658 = -2.19842 -> -2.198\n        hour22: -1.564 + 0.14658 = -1.41742 -> -1.417\n        hour23: -1.670 + 0.14658 = -1.52342 -> -1.523\n\n 39. Now for the second day (2017-09-07) with adjustment 0.29316:\n\n        hour00: -1.208 + 0.29316 = -0.91484 -> -0.915\n        hour01: -1.350 + 0.29316 = -1.05684 -> -1.057\n        ... and so on.\n\n 40. We do the same for the next two days.\n\n 41. We write the entire 96 records.\n\n 42. Note: The dates must be consecutive and in the same format.\n\n 43. We start from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 and go to 2017-09-09 23:00:00.\n\n 44. We output in the format:\n\n        date   MULL\n        [date string] [value]\n\n 45. We must note: the adjustment per day is increasing by 0.14658 each day.\n\n 46. We'll generate the data and output.\n\n 47. However, note: the average_daily_change was 0.14658, so the adjustments for the days are:\n\n        day5: 0.14658\n        day6: 0.29316\n        day7: 0.43974\n        day8: 0.58632\n\n 48. We'll generate the 96 records accordingly.\n\n 49. We must be cautious: the rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n 50. We output the entire block in the required format.\n\n 51. Since the calculation is repetitive, we can do it systematically.\n\n 52. We list the base values for 2017-09-05 (24 values):\n\n        base = [-1.208, -1.350, -1.492, -1.031, -1.812, -0.959, -2.949, -0.569, -1.919, -1.279, -1.244, -1.315, -1.350, 0.036, -0.782, -1.848, -1.954, -2.310, -2.772, -2.559, -2.701, -2.345, -1.564, -1.670]\n\n 53. Then for each day in the next 4 days, we add the corresponding adjustment and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 54. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-06, adjustment = 0.14658\n        Day2: 2017-09-07, adjustment = 0.29316\n        Day3: 2017-09-08, adjustment = 0.43974\n        Day4: 2017-09-09, adjustment = 0.58632\n\n 55. We write the data.\n\n 56. Note: The data must be in chronological order.\n\n 57. We'll write the code in our response as a formatted block.\n\n 58. Since we are to provide the complete data, we will write all 96 lines.\n\n 59. We note that the method is simple and may not capture all the dynamics, but it is a reasonable approach given the constraints.\n\n 60. We output.\n",
