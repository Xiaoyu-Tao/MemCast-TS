        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must be cautious: the data might have seasonality (daily, weekly) and trends.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we might consider:\n    - Seasonal models: since we have daily seasonality (24 hours in a day), we can use a seasonal decomposition or SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) might be appropriate.\n\n 5. However, note that we only have 4 days of data. This is very limited for training a model with weekly seasonality (if any) but we can capture daily seasonality.\n\n 6. Steps for modeling:\n    a. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    b. If non-stationary, we may need to difference (both regular and seasonal).\n    c. We'll use the 96 points to fit a model and then forecast 96 steps.\n\n 7. But note: the data provided is only 4 days. We have to be cautious about overfitting.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Use the average of each hour of the day from the available 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    However, the data might have a trend? Let's look at the data:\n\n    The data starts at 2016-11-10 and ends at 2016-11-13. We see that the values are fluctuating without a clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n    Example: \n        Day 1: min -0.469, max 3.483\n        Day 2: min 0.938, max 6.028\n        Day 3: min 0.603, max 3.818\n        Day 4: min -0.335, max 4.689\n\n    The pattern each day: \n        - The load tends to be lower during the night and higher during the day? But note the first day: \n          00:00: 3.349, 01:00: 3.014, ... 12:00: 1.206, 13:00: 2.947 -> so not exactly.\n\n    Since we have only 4 days, and the pattern is not very clear, we might consider a model that uses the average of the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data might have an anomaly (like the 6.028 on 2016-11-11 03:00:00. So we might use the median to be robust.\n\n 9. Approach: \n    We can group by the hour of the day (0 to 23) and take the median (or mean) of the 4 available days for that hour.\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat the daily pattern 4 times.\n\n    Why median? Because it is robust to outliers. For example, the 6.028 on 2016-11-11 03:00:00 is an outlier? \n\n    Let's check the values at 03:00:00 for the 4 days:\n        2016-11-10 03:00:00: 2.210\n        2016-11-11 03:00:00: 6.028   (outlier)\n        2016-11-12 03:00:00: 3.215\n        2016-11-13 03:00:00: 3.885\n\n    The median of [2.210, 6.028, 3.215, 3.885] is: \n        sorted: [2.210, 3.215, 3.885, 6.028] -> median = (3.215+3.885)/2 = 3.55\n\n    So we would use 3.55 for the 03:00 hour.\n\n 10. Steps for the simple model:\n     - Extract the hour from the datetime.\n     - Group by hour and compute the median (or mean) of the HULL values for that hour over the 4 days.\n     - Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00), we assign the median value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 11. Why not a more complex model? \n     With only 4 days, it is hard to fit a model that captures trends and seasonality beyond the daily cycle. \n     Also, we are not given any external variables.\n\n 12. However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. \n     But if we were to use a model that requires a contiguous series, we would have to impute. But in this case, we have no missing in the given.\n\n 13. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps: \n        Start: 2016-11-14 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-11-13 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-11-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-17 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 = 96 hours)\n\n 14. For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have a representative value (median of the 4 days for that hour).\n\n 15. Then we repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 16. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: [3.349, 3.014, 2.076, 4.689] -> sorted: [2.076, 3.014, 3.349, 4.689] -> median = (3.014+3.349)/2 = 3.1815\n     Hour 1: [3.014, 2.813, 2.947, 4.086] -> sorted: [2.813, 2.947, 3.014, 4.086] -> median = (2.947+3.014)/2 = 2.9805\n     Hour 2: [3.483, 2.210, 3.416, 3.416] -> sorted: [2.210, 3.416, 3.416, 3.483] -> median = (3.416+3.416)/2 = 3.416\n     Hour 3: [2.210, 6.028, 3.215, 3.885] -> sorted: [2.210, 3.215, 3.885, 6.028] -> median = (3.215+3.885)/2 = 3.55\n     Hour 4: [2.813, 2.813, 3.818, 3.282] -> sorted: [2.813, 2.813, 3.282, 3.818] -> median = (2.813+3.282)/2 = 3.0475\n     Hour 5: [2.679, 5.425, 3.550, 2.545] -> sorted: [2.545, 2.679, 3.550, 5.425] -> median = (2.679+3.550)/2 = 3.1145\n     Hour 6: [2.210, 3.885, 3.617, 3.148] -> sorted: [2.210, 3.148, 3.617, 3.885] -> median = (3.148+3.617)/2 = 3.3825\n     Hour 7: [2.746, 2.344, 3.751, 3.148] -> sorted: [2.344, 2.746, 3.148, 3.751] -> median = (2.746+3.148)/2 = 2.947\n     Hour 8: [3.349, 3.148, 2.679, 1.674] -> sorted: [1.674, 2.679, 3.148, 3.349] -> median = (2.679+3.148)/2 = 2.9135\n     Hour 9: [2.947, 1.474, 2.679, 2.277] -> sorted: [1.474, 2.277, 2.679, 2.947] -> median = (2.277+2.679)/2 = 2.478\n     Hour 10: [2.478, 2.344, 2.478, 2.143] -> sorted: [2.143, 2.344, 2.478, 2.478] -> median = (2.344+2.478)/2 = 2.411\n     Hour 11: [2.076, 2.143, 1.942, 2.009] -> sorted: [1.942, 2.009, 2.076, 2.143] -> median = (2.009+2.076)/2 = 2.0425\n     Hour 12: [1.206, 1.206, 1.608, 1.541] -> sorted: [1.206, 1.206, 1.541, 1.608] -> median = (1.206+1.541)/2 = 1.3735\n     Hour 13: [2.947, 1.808, 2.277, 2.143] -> sorted: [1.808, 2.143, 2.277, 2.947] -> median = (2.143+2.277)/2 = 2.21\n     Hour 14: [2.478, 1.608, 2.545, 2.344] -> sorted: [1.608, 2.344, 2.478, 2.545] -> median = (2.344+2.478)/2 = 2.411\n     Hour 15: [2.210, 1.808, 1.942, 2.076] -> sorted: [1.808, 1.942, 2.076, 2.210] -> median = (1.942+2.076)/2 = 2.009\n     Hour 16: [2.813, 1.808, 2.746, 1.875] -> sorted: [1.808, 1.875, 2.746, 2.813] -> median = (1.875+2.746)/2 = 2.3105\n     Hour 17: [2.277, 1.674, 2.143, 1.608] -> sorted: [1.608, 1.674, 2.143, 2.277] -> median = (1.674+2.143)/2 = 1.9085\n     Hour 18: [1.474, 1.072, 0.938, 1.139] -> sorted: [0.938, 1.072, 1.139, 1.474] -> median = (1.072+1.139)/2 = 1.1055\n     Hour 19: [0.938, 1.139, 1.139, 0.670] -> sorted: [0.670, 0.938, 1.139, 1.139] -> median = (0.938+1.139)/2 = 1.0385\n     Hour 20: [1.072, 0.938, 1.005, 0.603] -> sorted: [0.603, 0.938, 1.005, 1.072] -> median = (0.938+1.005)/2 = 0.9715\n     Hour 21: [-0.469, 1.072, 0.603, -0.335] -> sorted: [-0.469, -0.335, 0.603, 1.072] -> median = (-0.335+0.603)/2 = 0.134\n     Hour 22: [1.608, 2.880, 1.875, 1.608] -> sorted: [1.608, 1.608, 1.875, 2.880] -> median = (1.608+1.875)/2 = 1.7415\n     Hour 23: [1.005, 3.349, 2.143, 2.210] -> sorted: [1.005, 2.143, 2.210, 3.349] -> median = (2.143+2.210)/2 = 2.1765\n\n 17.

We output the data in the required format.\n\n 19. Note: This method is simple and robust, but it ignores any potential trend. However, with only 4 days, it's hard to estimate a trend.\n\n 20. We'll generate the timestamps and the corresponding median value for the hour.\n\n Implementation:\n\n     Start date: 2016-11-14 00:00:00\n     End date: 2016-11-17 23:00:00\n\n     We'll create a list of 96 timestamps, and for each timestamp, we take the hour and assign the median value we computed for that hour.\n\n 21. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 22. Let's write the data:\n\n     We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n     The median values by hour (0 to 23) as above.\n\n 23. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-14 00:00:00  <value>\n2016-11-14 01:00:00  <value>\n...\n2016-11-17 23:00:00  <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 24. We must not omit any content.\n\n Let's code the output.\n\n However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n But note: the median calculations above were done with more precision. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n Revised medians rounded to 3 decimals:\n\n Hour 0: 3.182\n Hour 1: 2.981\n Hour 2: 3.416\n Hour 3: 3.550\n Hour 4: 3.048\n Hour 5: 3.115\n Hour 6: 3.383\n Hour 7: 2.947\n Hour 8: 2.914\n Hour 9: 2.478\n Hour 10: 2.411\n Hour 11: 2.043\n Hour 12: 1.374\n Hour 13: 2.210\n Hour 14: 2.411\n Hour 15: 2.009\n Hour 16: 2.311\n Hour 17: 1.909\n Hour 18: 1.106\n Hour 19: 1.039\n Hour 20: 0.972\n Hour 21: 0.134\n Hour 22: 1.742\n Hour 23: 2.177\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Day 1: 2016-11-14: hours 0 to 23 -> use the above 24 values in order.\n   Day 2: 2016-11-15: same 24 values.\n   Day 3: 2016-11-16: same 24 values.\n   Day 4: 2016-11-17: same 24 values.\n\n 25. We output the date in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 26. We must be careful: the date format.\n\n 27. We write the data.\n\n 28. Note: This method does not account for any trend, but with only 4 days of data, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 29. If we had more data, we could use a more sophisticated model. But the problem states we are an expert and we must provide the complete data.\n\n 30. We output the 96 lines.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
