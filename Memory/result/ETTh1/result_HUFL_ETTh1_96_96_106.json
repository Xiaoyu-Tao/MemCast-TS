        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series structure with hourly frequency.\n 2. There are missing values in the provided data? Actually, the provided data for the past 96 points does not have missing values? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", however, in the provided 96 points, we don't have any missing value? \n    But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning that in the forecasting we might have to handle potential missing values? \n    However, the provided past data is complete. So we can use it to build a model.\n\n 3. Since the problem does not specify the method, we choose a suitable time series forecasting method. \n    Given the data is at hourly intervals and likely to have daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 4. We note that the last part of the provided data (2017-08-31) has a constant value of 9.578 for 24 hours? This might be an anomaly or missing data? \n    But the problem says the data will have missing values. However, in the provided segment, we don't see any explicit missing value (like NaN) but we see a constant for a whole day? \n    This might be an indicator of a problem. But we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we have to forecast the next 96.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a model that is robust to some anomalies. Since the data is only 96 points, we can use:\n      - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) such as Holt-Winters.\n      - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) which can handle seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data has a potential anomaly on 2017-08-31 (constant for 24 hours). We might consider that as missing? \n    But the problem says the data has missing values, so we should handle it. But in the provided data, it's given as 9.578 for 24 hours? \n    We have two options:\n        a) Treat that day as missing and impute the values? But we are not asked to impute the past, we are asked to forecast the future.\n        b) Use the data as is and hope the model can handle it? \n\n    Since we are forecasting, we can use the entire provided data to build the model. The constant day might be a data collection issue, but without more context, we proceed.\n\n 7. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24 hours). \n\n 8. We choose SARIMA because it can model both non-seasonal and seasonal components.\n\n 9. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We have seasonality of period 24 (hourly data, daily seasonality).\n    - We need to determine the orders: (p, d, q) and (P, D, Q, s) with s=24.\n\n 10. However, to keep it simple and because we are limited in data (only 4 days), we might use a simple model. \n     note: 4 days is very short for a seasonal model with 24 periods. We might not have enough seasonal cycles.\n\n 11. Alternative: Use a non-seasonal model and include time features (like hour of day) in a regression model? \n     But we are forecasting 96 steps ahead, so we can use a model that uses lag features and cyclic encoding of the hour.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to forecast 96 points, we can use a simpler method: \n     - We can use the last week pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we don't have a full week.\n\n 13. Another idea: Use a naive method? But the problem says we are an expert.\n\n 14. We note that the data shows a daily pattern: \n        - During the day (from 00:00 to about 11:00) the values are generally higher? \n        - Then they drop during the day? \n        But looking at the data, for example on 2017-08-29: \n            - It starts at 16.879 at 00:00, then decreases until 11:00 (3.081) and then increases again in the evening.\n\n 15. We can try to use a model that uses the average of the same hour in the past days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 16. Considering the constraints, we will use a SARIMA model with a fixed seasonal period of 24. We'll choose a simple order.\n\n 17. Steps for SARIMA:\n     - We need to make the series stationary? We can check for stationarity.\n     - But with only 4 days, it's hard. We can assume d=1 and D=1 (for non-seasonal and seasonal differencing).\n\n 18. We'll use auto_arima from pmdarima to select the best parameters? But we cannot run code, so we have to simulate.\n\n 19. Since we are an AI and we have to provide an answer, we will generate a forecast using a pre-trained model? \n     But we are not given the entire history, only 96 points.\n\n 20. We note that the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", meaning we have to base our forecast on these 96 points.\n\n 21. We decide to use a simple SARIMA model: (1,0,1) for non-seasonal and (0,1,1) for seasonal with period 24.\n\n 22. Why? \n     - We don't have a trend? The data doesn't show a clear trend over the 4 days? \n     - We have seasonality, so we take a seasonal difference (D=1) and a seasonal MA term (Q=1) to capture the seasonal pattern.\n\n 23. We fit the model on the 96 points and then forecast 96 steps.\n\n 24. However, we cannot actually run the model because we are in a text-based environment. So we have to simulate the output.\n\n 25. But note: the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates. We must provide the dates and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n 26. How to simulate? \n     - We can generate a pattern that follows the same daily cycle? \n     - We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days? But the 4th day (2017-08-31) is constant and might be an anomaly? \n        So we can use the first 3 days to compute the hourly average? \n\n 27. Let's compute the hourly average for the first 3 days (excluding the constant day) for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     We have:\n        Day1: 2017-08-29 (00:00 to 23:00) -> 24 values\n        Day2: 2017-08-30 (00:00 to 23:00) -> 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-08-31 (00:00 to 23:00) -> 24 values, but they are all 9.578? This day is suspicious.\n\n     We decide to use only Day1 and Day2 for the pattern? Because Day3 is constant and might be an error.\n\n 28. Then we have two days of data for each hour. We average the two for each hour.\n\n     Hour 00: (16.879 + 12.391) / 2 = 14.635\n     Hour 01: (14.200 + 11.855) / 2 = 13.0275\n     ... and so on.\n\n 29. Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we can use the same pattern? But we have to account for the fact that the level might change? \n     We can adjust by the last known value? \n\n 30. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-01) as a base? But that day is not complete? Actually, we have the entire day.\n\n 31. We note that the data on 2017-09-01 is not constant? So we can use the pattern from 2017-09-01? \n\n 32. However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-02 00:00:00.\n\n 33. We can do:\n     - Use the average of the last two non-constant days (2017-08-29 and 2017-08-30) for the pattern, and then adjust the level of the last day (2017-09-01).\n\n 34. Steps for the forecast:\n     a) Compute the hourly profile (average for each of the 24 hours) from 2017-08-29 and 2017-08-30.\n     b) Compute the average of the entire day for 2017-08-29 and 2017-08-30: \n          Day1: average = (16.879+14.200+...+11.320)/24 = we can compute roughly? \n          But we don't need to, because we are going to use the relative pattern.\n\n     c) Alternatively, we can normalize the profile by the daily average? But we don't have to.\n\n     d) Then we take the last day (2017-09-01) and compute its daily average? \n          Let's compute: \n            values: 11.922, 12.592, 12.458, 8.506, ... until 8.506 (last value 8.506? Actually the last value is 8.506 at 23:00? \n            But the data for 2017-09-01: \n                00:00: 11.922\n                01:00: 12.592\n                02:00: 12.458\n                03:00: 11.454\n                04:00: 11.588\n                05:00: 12.458\n                06:00: 13.128\n                07:00: 10.717\n                08:00: 8.506\n                09:00: 7.904\n                10:00: 5.894\n                11:00: 3.282\n                12:00: -1.608\n                13:00: -0.938\n                14:00: -1.474\n                15:00: -13.262\n                16:00: 0.938\n                17:00: 6.028\n                18:00: 7.167\n                19:00: 7.636\n                20:00: 7.368\n                21:00: 6.698\n                22:00: 6.966\n                23:00: 8.506   -> The average of 2017-09-01: \n        We can compute: \n          Sum = 11.922+12.592+12.458+11.454+11.588+12.458+13.128+10.717+8.506+7.904+5.894+3.282-1.608-0.938-1.474-13.262+0.938+6.028+7.167+7.636+7.368+6.698+6.966+8.506\n        Let's do step by step:\n          Positive: 11.922+12.592+12.458+11.454+11.588+12.458+13.128+10.717+8.506+7.904+5.894+3.282+0.938+6.028+7.167+7.636+7.368+6.698+6.966+8.506 = \n          Negative: -1.608 -0.938 -1.474 -13.262\n\n        Positive sum: \n          11.922+12.592 = 24.514\n          +12.458 = 36.972\n          +11.454 = 48.426\n          +11.588 = 60.014\n          +12.458 = 72.472\n          +13.128 = 85.6\n          +10.717 = 96.317\n          +8.506 = 104.823\n          +7.904 = 112.727\n          +5.894 = 118.621\n          +3.282 = 121.903\n          +0.938 = 122.841\n          +6.028 = 128.869\n          +7.167 = 136.036\n          +7.636 = 143.672\n          +7.368 = 151.04\n          +6.698 = 157.738\n          +6.966 = 164.704\n          +8.506 = 173.21\n\n        Negative sum: -1.608 -0.938 = -2.546; -1.474 = -4.02; -13.262 = -17.282\n\n        Total = 173.21 - 17.282 = 155.928\n        Average = 155.928 / 24 = 6.497\n\n     e) Similarly, for the average of the two days (2017-08-29 and 2017-08-30) we can compute the overall average? \n        But we don't need the overall average? We need the hourly pattern.\n\n     f) We compute the hourly pattern (average for each hour of the day) from the two days:\n\n        Hour 00: (16.879 + 12.391) / 2 = 14.635\n        Hour 01: (14.200 + 11.855) / 2 = 13.0275\n        Hour 02: (12.123 + 11.788) / 2 = 11.9555\n        Hour 03: (12.860 + 10.650) / 2 = 11.755\n        Hour 04: (11.855 + 12.190) / 2 = 12.0225\n        Hour 05: (11.119 + 12.056) / 2 = 11.5875\n        Hour 06: (11.788 + 11.989) / 2 = 11.8885\n        Hour 07: (10.784 + 10.315) / 2 = 10.5495\n        Hour 08: (8.640 + 9.176) / 2 = 8.908\n        Hour 09: (8.172 + 5.760) / 2 = 6.966\n        Hour 10: (8.239 + 6.229) / 2 = 7.234\n        Hour 11: (3.081 + 3.885) / 2 = 3.483\n        Hour 12: (3.885 + 1.608) / 2 = 2.7465\n        Hour 13: (4.488 + 1.674) / 2 = 3.081\n        Hour 14: (4.287 + 2.478) / 2 = 3.3825\n        Hour 15: (4.756 + 3.952) / 2 = 4.354\n        Hour 16: (6.430 + 4.086) / 2 = 5.258\n        Hour 17: (8.038 + 6.430) / 2 = 7.234\n        Hour 18: (7.234 + 6.765) / 2 = 6.9995\n        Hour 19: (7.636 + 7.368) / 2 = 7.502\n        Hour 20: (8.439 + 7.971) / 2 = 8.205\n        Hour 21: (9.310 + 6.966) / 2 = 8.138\n        Hour 22: (8.975 + 6.296) / 2 = 7.6355\n        Hour 23: (11.320 + 8.306) / 2 = 9.813\n\n     g) Now, the average of this pattern over 24 hours: \n          Sum = 14.635+13.0275+11.9555+11.755+12.0225+11.5875+11.8885+10.5495+8.908+6.966+7.234+3.483+2.7465+3.081+3.3825+4.354+5.258+7.234+6.9995+7.502+8.205+8.138+7.6355+9.813\n          Let's compute:\n            14.635+13.0275 = 27.6625\n            +11.9555 = 39.618\n            +11.755 = 51.373\n            +12.0225 = 63.3955\n            +11.5875 = 74.983\n            +11.8885 = 86.8715\n            +10.5495 = 97.421\n            +8.908 = 106.329\n            +6.966 = 113.295\n            +7.234 = 120.529\n            +3.483 = 124.012\n            +2.7465 = 126.7585\n            +3.081 = 129.8395\n            +3.3825 = 133.222\n            +4.354 = 137.576\n            +5.258 = 142.834\n            +7.234 = 150.068\n            +6.9995 = 157.0675\n            +7.502 = 164.5695\n            +8.205 = 172.7745\n            +8.138 = 180.9125\n            +7.6355 = 188.548\n            +9.813 = 198.361\n\n          Average = 198.361 / 24 = 8.265\n\n     h) The last day (2017-09-01) had an average of 6.497. So we adjust the pattern by a factor? \n        We can shift the pattern by the difference in average? \n        Factor = 6.497 / 8.265 = approximately 0.786\n\n        Then for each hour in the pattern, we multiply by 0.786 to get the forecast for the same hour in the next day? \n\n     i) But note: the pattern we computed is from two days that are earlier and might be at a different level. \n        We are using the last day's average to adjust.\n\n     j) Then for the next 4 days, we can use the adjusted pattern? \n\n 35. However, we note that the pattern might change? But we have no way to know. \n\n 36. We generate the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the adjusted pattern 4 times? \n\n 37. Steps for each day in the next 4 days (starting from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00):\n     - For hour 00: 14.635 * 0.786 = 11.50\n     - For hour 01: 13.0275 * 0.786 = 10.24\n     - ... and so on.\n\n 38. But note: the adjusted pattern might be too low? Because the last day had a negative value? \n\n 39. Alternatively, we can use additive adjustment? \n        adjustment = average of last day (6.497) - average of pattern (8.265) = -1.768\n        Then for each hour: pattern_value + adjustment\n\n     Then:\n        Hour 00: 14.635 - 1.768 = 12.867\n        Hour 01: 13.0275 - 1.768 = 11.2595\n        ... \n\n 40. Which one is better? Multiplicative might not be suitable because we have negative values in the last day? \n     But the pattern we computed is all positive? \n\n     However, the last day had a negative value at 15:00? So additive is safer.\n\n 41. We choose additive adjustment.\n\n 42. Then the forecast for the first day (2017-09-02) is the pattern (for 00 to 23) plus the adjustment (-1.768).\n\n 43. For the next three days, we can use the same pattern? But we don't know if the level will change? \n     We can keep the same pattern? \n\n 44. Alternatively, we can use the pattern and adjust by the same additive factor? \n\n 45. We decide to use the same pattern for all 4 days? \n\n 46. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not given any in the past 96? \n     And we are forecasting the future. We are not handling missing values in the forecast? \n\n 47. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day1: 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-02 23:00:00: \n        hour00: 14.635 - 1.768 = 12.867\n        hour01: 13.0275 - 1.768 = 11.2595\n        hour02: 11.9555 - 1.768 = 10.1875\n        hour03: 11.755 - 1.768 = 9.987\n        hour04: 12.0225 - 1.768 = 10.2545\n        hour05: 11.5875 - 1.768 = 9.8195\n        hour06: 11.8885 - 1.768 = 10.1205\n        hour07: 10.5495 - 1.768 = 8.7815\n        hour08: 8.908 - 1.768 = 7.14\n        hour09: 6.966 - 1.768 = 5.198\n        hour10: 7.234 - 1.768 = 5.466\n        hour11: 3.483 - 1.768 = 1.715\n        hour12: 2.7465 - 1.768 = 0.9785\n        hour13: 3.081 - 1.768 = 1.313\n        hour14: 3.3825 - 1.768 = 1.6145\n        hour15: 4.354 - 1.768 = 2.586\n        hour16: 5.258 - 1.768 = 3.49\n        hour17: 7.234 - 1.768 = 5.466\n        hour18: 6.9995 - 1.768 = 5.2315\n        hour19: 7.502 - 1.768 = 5.734\n        hour20: 8.205 - 1.768 = 6.437\n        hour21: 8.138 - 1.768 = 6.37\n        hour22: 7.6355 - 1.768 = 5.8675\n        hour23: 9.813 - 1.768 = 8.045\n\n     Then we repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days? \n\n 48. But note: the level might change? We don't know. We assume the same pattern? \n\n 49. Alternatively, we can use the pattern without adjustment for the next days? But the adjustment was for the level of the last day? \n     We don't have information for the next days. So we keep the same pattern? \n\n 50. However, we note that the problem says the data has load metrics and might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days? \n\n 51. We decide to use the same pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n 52. But the last day we used for adjustment (2017-09-01) was a Friday? Then 2017-09-02 is Saturday, 2017-09-03 Sunday, 2017-09-04 Monday, 2017-09-05 Tuesday? \n     We don't have information about weekends? \n\n 53. Since we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality, we use the same pattern.\n\n 54. We generate the next 96 hours by repeating the above 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 55. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimals.\n\n 56. But note: the original data had negative values? So our forecast might have negative? \n\n 57. We write the dates starting from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n\n 58. We must provide the complete data in the format:\n\n        date                  HUFL\n        2017-09-02 00:00:00  12.867\n        2017-09-02 01:00:00  11.259\n        ... \n\n 59. We note: the adjustment factor was computed as -1.768, and the pattern values are as above.\n\n 60. We compute the pattern for 24 hours (with additive adjustment) and then repeat 4 times.\n\n 61. Let's list the 24 adjusted values:\n\n        h00: 14.635 - 1.768 = 12.867\n        h01: 13.0275 - 1.768 = 11.2595 -> 11.260\n        h02: 11.9555 - 1.768 = 10.1875 -> 10.188\n        h03: 11.755 - 1.768 = 9.987\n        h04: 12.0225 - 1.768 = 10.2545 -> 10.255\n        h05: 11.5875 - 1.768 = 9.8195 -> 9.820\n        h06: 11.8885 - 1.768 = 10.1205 -> 10.121\n        h07: 10.5495 - 1.768 = 8.7815 -> 8.782\n        h08: 8.908 - 1.768 = 7.140\n        h09: 6.966 - 1.768 = 5.198\n        h10: 7.234 - 1.768 = 5.466\n        h11: 3.483 - 1.768 = 1.715\n        h12: 2.7465 - 1.768 = 0.9785 -> 0.979\n        h13: 3.081 - 1.768 = 1.313\n        h14: 3.3825 - 1.768 = 1.6145 -> 1.614\n        h15: 4.354 - 1.768 = 2.586\n        h16: 5.258 - 1.768 = 3.490\n        h17: 7.234 - 1.768 = 5.466\n        h18: 6.9995 - 1.768 = 5.2315 -> 5.232\n        h19: 7.502 - 1.768 = 5.734\n        h20: 8.205 - 1.768 = 6.437\n        h21: 8.138 - 1.768 = 6.370\n        h22: 7.6355 - 1.768 = 5.8675 -> 5.868\n        h23: 9.813 - 1.768 = 8.045\n\n 62. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 63. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-02 23:00:00: the 24 values above.\n        Day2: 2017-09-03 00:00:00 to 2017-09-03 23:00:00: same 24 values.\n        Day3: 2017-09-04 00:00:00 to 2017-09-04 23:00:00: same 24 values.\n        Day4: 2017-09-05 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00: same 24 values.\n\n 64. But note: the last provided day was 2017-09-01 (Friday). Then:\n        2017-09-02: Saturday\n        2017-09-03: Sunday\n        2017-09-04: Monday\n        2017-09-05: Tuesday\n\n     We don't have data to account for weekend effect? So we use the same pattern.\n\n 65. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate, HUFL\n2017-09-02 00:00:00, 12.867\n2017-09-02 01:00:00, 11.260\n2017-09-02 02:00:00, 10.188\n2017-09-02 03:00:00, 9.987\n2017-09-02 04:00:00, 10.255\n2017-09-02 05:00:00, 9.820\n2017-09-02 06:00:00, 10.121\n2017-09-02 07:00:00, 8.782\n2017-09-02 08:00:00, 7.140\n2017-09-02 09:00:00, 5.198\n2017-09-02 10:00:00, 5.466\n2017-09-02 11:00:00, 1.715\n2017-09-02 12:00:00, 0.979\n2017-09-02 13:00:00, 1.313\n2017-09-02 14:00:00, 1.614\n2017-09-02 15:00:00, 2.586\n2017-09-02 16:00:00, 3.490\n2017-09-02 17:00:00, 5.466\n2017-09-02 18:00:00, 5.232\n2017-09-02 19:00:00, 5.734\n2017-09-02 20:00:00, 6.437\n2017-09-02 21:00:00, 6.370\n2017-09-02 22:00:00, 5.868\n2017-09-02 23:00:00, 8.045\n\n        ... and then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 66.
