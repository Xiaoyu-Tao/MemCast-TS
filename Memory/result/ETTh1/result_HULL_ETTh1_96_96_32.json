        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series structure with hourly frequency.\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing (we have 24*4=96). However, the problem says the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. But the provided data for the past 96 is complete.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data shows some daily seasonality (as we see patterns repeating every 24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data is very short (only 4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days. We can try to model the daily pattern and also the trend, but the trend over 4 days might be hard to capture.\n\n Given the constraints, we can consider:\n - Using a simple seasonal model: for example, the last available day (2016-11-09) might be similar to the next day? But we see that the pattern is not exactly repeating.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an automated time series model. Since we are in a constrained environment and cannot run complex models, we can use a naive seasonal approach or a moving average.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more robust method.\n\n However, without the ability to run code, we must rely on a heuristic.\n\n Proposed method:\n We observe that the data has:\n   - A daily pattern: lower values during the day (especially around noon) and higher at night? But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same each day.\n\n We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a flat forecast for each hour.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-09) and adjust it by the trend of the previous days? But the trend is not clear.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the model and we must provide the data, we will use a simple approach:\n\n 1. Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual.\n 2. For the trend, we can use a linear regression over the 4 days? But 4 days is very short. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last day as the base and then add the seasonal component.\n\n However, we are limited by the fact that we are not running code. We must make a reasonable forecast.\n\n Let me try to compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 observations.\n\n We can calculate the mean for each hour and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would ignore any trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-09) and then adjust by the average of the differences between consecutive days? \n\n But note: the data for 2016-11-09 is:\n\n 00:00: 2.143\n 01:00: 1.072\n 02:00: 0.536\n 03:00: 0.804\n 04:00: 1.340\n 05:00: 0.938\n 06:00: 0.670\n 07:00: 1.005\n 08:00: 0.536\n 09:00: 0.871\n 10:00: 0.603\n 11:00: 0.536\n 12:00: -0.938\n 13:00: 1.139\n 14:00: 2.478\n 15:00: 1.674\n 16:00: 2.143\n 17:00: 2.344\n 18:00: 1.206\n 19:00: 1.206\n 20:00: 1.541\n 21:00: 0.268\n 22:00: 1.407\n 23:00: 2.277\n\n We can use this day as the base and then adjust by the average change from day to day? \n\n How to compute the average change per hour from one day to the next?\n\n We have:\n Day1: 2016-11-06\n Day2: 2016-11-07\n Day3: 2016-11-08\n Day4: 2016-11-09\n\n For each hour, we can compute the difference between consecutive days and then average the differences? But we only have 3 differences per hour.\n\n Example for hour 00:00:\n   Day1: 3.215\n   Day2: 3.617 -> diff1 = 3.617 - 3.215 = 0.402\n   Day3: 2.478 -> diff2 = 2.478 - 3.617 = -1.139\n   Day4: 2.143 -> diff3 = 2.143 - 2.478 = -0.335\n\n Average change for 00:00: (0.402 -1.139 -0.335)/3 = (-1.072)/3 = -0.357\n\n Then the forecast for 2016-11-10 00:00:00 would be 2.143 (last value for 00:00) + (-0.357) = 1.786\n\n But note: the trend might not be linear and we have only 4 days. Also, the average change is negative.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the overall trend? The average of the entire series and then project? \n\n However, we are going to forecast 96 points. We can do this for each hour.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. We are to forecast the next 96 without missing? We must provide complete.\n\n Since we are to provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n For each hour in the day (0 to 23) for the next 4 days (2016-11-10 to 2016-11-13), we compute:\n\n   forecast_hour_i = last_observed_hour_i (from 2016-11-09) + average_difference_hour_i\n\n But we have to be cautious: the average_difference might be computed from only 3 differences and might be volatile.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the overall average for each hour without trend? \n\n Let me compute the average for each hour over the 4 days:\n\n Hour 00: (3.215 + 3.617 + 2.478 + 2.143) / 4 = (3.215+3.617=6.832; 6.832+2.478=9.31; 9.31+2.143=11.453) -> 11.453/4 = 2.86325\n\n Similarly for other hours.\n\n Then we use these averages for each hour for the next 4 days? That would be a constant daily pattern.\n\n But note: the data shows a downward trend? The 00:00 hour: 3.215, 3.617, 2.478, 2.143 -> decreasing.\n\n So we might want to account for the trend. We can do:\n\n   Forecast for day5 (2016-11-10) at hour i = average_hour_i + (slope * 5)   [if we consider day1 as 1, day2 as 2, ...]\n\n But we don't have a global trend for each hour? We can compute a linear trend for each hour? \n\n However, with 4 points, linear regression per hour is overkill.\n\n We can use the average of the differences as the daily change and then project:\n\n   For hour i, let the values be: x1, x2, x3, x4 for day1, day2, day4.\n   The differences: d1 = x2 - x1, d2 = x3 - x2, d3 = x4 - x3.\n   Average difference d_avg = (d1+d2+d3)/3.\n\n   Then for day5: x5 = x4 + d_avg\n        day6: x6 = x5 + d_avg = x4 + 2*d_avg\n        day7: x7 = x4 + 3*d_avg\n        day8: x8 = x4 + 4*d_avg\n\n But wait, we are forecasting 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) for each hour.\n\n However, note: the trend might not be linear and we are extrapolating 4 days from 4 days. This might be unstable.\n\n Considering the above, and the fact that the data is very short, we decide to use the average per hour without trend for simplicity and stability.\n\n But let's compare:\n\n Without trend: we get a constant daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n With trend: we get a linear change per day for each hour.\n\n Given the volatility in the differences (as seen in 00:00: 0.402, -1.139, -0.335 -> which are not consistent), the average difference might not be reliable.\n\n Therefore, we choose to use the average per hour over the 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n 2. For the next 4 days (2016-11-10 to 2016-11-13), we repeat the same 24-hour pattern (the computed mean for each hour) for each day.\n\n This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n Hour 0: (3.215 + 3.617 + 2.478 + 2.143) / 4 = 11.453 / 4 = 2.86325\n Hour 1: (2.210 + 3.617 + 1.942 + 1.072) / 4 = (2.210+3.617=5.827;
