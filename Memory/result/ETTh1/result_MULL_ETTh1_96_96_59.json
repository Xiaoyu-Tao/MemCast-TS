        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-02 00:00:00? Let's check: 96 hours from 2017-02-25 23:00:00 is 4 days, so 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-01 23:00:00? Actually, 96 hours is exactly 4 days, so we are forecasting from 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-03-01 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the last provided data point is at 2017-02-25 23:00:00. The next 96 points would be:\n  2017-02-26 00:00:00, 2017-02-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-01 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours).\n\n But note: the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. However, we are told that the dataset may have missing values, so we must be cautious. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we can proceed.\n\n Approach:\n We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the complexity and the fact that we are not provided with the entire history (only 96 points) and that the data is hourly, we can use a model that can handle time series with multiple seasonality. However, 96 points (4 days) is a very short history for training a model. We might consider:\n\n 1. Using a simple model like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing, but with such a short history and the need for 96-step ahead forecast, it might be challenging.\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality. Since we have 24 points per day, we can set seasonality of 24.\n\n But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern? Let's observe:\n\n   The values are negative during the day and positive at night? Actually, looking at the data:\n\n   On 2017-02-22: \n        Daytime (e.g., 8:00 to 20:00) has values that are mostly negative and become more negative in the evening (around 18:00-20:00) and then become less negative at night.\n\n   On 2017-02-23: \n        Similar pattern: negative during the day, then at 20:00 it becomes positive? Actually, on 2017-02-23 at 20:00: 0.213, then 21:00: 0.071, 22:00: 0.817, 23:00: 2.878.\n\n   Then 2017-02-24: \n        00:00: 2.630, 01:00: 3.163, ... then at 08:00: 0.249, and then becomes negative again.\n\n   So it seems there is a daily pattern: the load is more during the night (positive) and less (or negative) during the day? \n\n However, note the variable is called \"Middle UseLess Load\", so the interpretation of the sign is not clear.\n\n Given the short history, we can use a seasonal model. We'll use a seasonal naive approach? But that would just repeat the last day? Or we can use an average of the four days we have.\n\n But note: the data has 4 days? Actually, from 2017-02-22 to 2017-02-25: that's 4 days? \n   From 2017-02-22 00:00) to 2017-02-25 23:00: that's 4*24=96 points.\n\n We can try to compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n However, the data shows a trend? Let's see:\n\n   The last day (2017-02-25) has a pattern that seems to have more negative values? But then again, the night of 2017-02-25 ends with 0.249 at 23:00.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that decomposes the time series and then forecasts the components. But given the constraints, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Check for stationarity? We don't have enough points for a proper test.\n\n   Step 2: We can use a simple average of the same hour across the four days.\n\n   However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). The next 4 days would be Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed? So we don't have the same days of the week.\n\n   But we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality (which would require at least 2 weeks). So we stick to daily.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n   But note: the four days are consecutive and might have different behaviors (weekday vs weekend). The 25th is a Saturday? Then the next day (26th) is Sunday, then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? We don't have Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in the history? We have:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-22: Wednesday\n        Day 2: 2017-02-23: Thursday\n        Day 3: 2017-02-24: Friday\n        Day 4: 2017-02-25: Saturday\n\n   The next 4 days:\n\n        Day 5: 2017-02-26: Sunday\n        Day 6: 2017-02-27: Monday\n        Day 7: 2017-02-28: Tuesday\n        Day 8: 2017-03-01: Wednesday\n\n   We don't have Sunday, Monday, Tuesday in the history. So we cannot use the same-hour average for Sunday? \n\n   Alternative: we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But we only have one Wednesday, one Thursday, etc.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        For the first 24 hours (2017-02-26, Sunday): we use the average of the only Sunday we have? But we don't have Sunday. \n\n        Instead, we can use the average of all days? Or we can use the average of the same hour over the four days? \n\n   Since we don't have weekly data, we'll assume the daily pattern is dominant and use the average of the same hour over the four days.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For hour 0: average of [2017-02-22 00:00, 2017-02-23 00:00, 2017-02-24 00:00, 2017-02-25 00:00]\n        For hour 1: average of [2017-02-22 01:00, 2017-02-23 01:00, 2017-02-25 01:00]\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   However, note: the data might have a trend? We can try to remove a linear trend? But with 4 days, it's hard. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern? \n\n   But the problem: the last day (Saturday) might be different from the next day (Sunday). \n\n   Given the ambiguity, we'll use the average of the four days for each hour.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (-0.782 + -0.462 + 2.630 + -0.497) / 4 = ( -0.782 -0.462 +2.630 -0.497 ) /4 = (0.889) /4 = 0.22225\n        hour1: (-0.924 + -0.497 + 3.163 + -0.604) /4 = (-0.924-0.497+3.163-0.604)/4 = (1.138)/4 = 0.2845\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We must compute for all 24 hours.\n\n   However, note: the data might have missing values? The provided 96 points are complete. So we can compute.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the data will have missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n   We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-26, Sunday: hours 0 to 23): [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n        Day2 (2017-02-27, Monday): same [avg0, avg1, ... avg23]\n        Day3 (2017-02-28, Tuesday): same\n        Day4 (2017-03-01, Wednesday): same\n\n   But note: the last day in the history is a Saturday, and we are forecasting a Wednesday? We are using the same pattern for every day? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same day of the week? But we only have one Wednesday, one Thursday, etc. So we can do:\n\n        For Sunday: we don't have, so we use the overall average? Or we can use the average of Saturday? But we have only one Saturday.\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            Wednesday: 2017-02-22\n            Thursday: 2017-02-23\n            Friday: 2017-02-24\n            Saturday: 2017-02-25\n\n        For the forecast:\n\n            Sunday: 2017-02-26 -> we don't have Sunday in history -> use the average of all days? or use the Saturday pattern? \n\n        We don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality. So we stick to the daily average.\n\n   Therefore, we compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the four days and then repeat that pattern for the next four days.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the values.\n\n        hour0: [ -0.782, -0.462, 2.630, -0.497 ] -> mean = ( -0.782 -0.462 +2.630 -0.497 ) /4 = (0.889)/4 = 0.22225\n        hour1: [ -0.924, -0.497, 3.163, -0.604 ] -> ( -0.924 -0.497 +3.163 -0.604 ) = 1.138 /4 = 0.2845\n        hour2: [ -0.817, -0.497, 3.127, -0.107 ] -> ( -0.817 -0.497 +3.127 -0.107 ) = 1.706 /4 = 0.4265\n        hour3: [ -0.924, -0.249, 2.274, -0.497 ] -> ( -0.924 -0.249 +2.274 -0.497 ) = 0.604 /4 = 0.151\n        hour4: [ -1.670, -1.954, 1.919, -0.213 ] -> ( -1.670 -1.954 +1.919 -0.213 ) = -1.918 /4 = -0.4795\n        hour5: [ -0.995, -1.386, 3.234, -1.528 ] -> ( -0.995 -1.386 +3.234 -1.528 ) = -0.675 /4 = -0.16875\n        hour6: [ -0.924, -1.208, 2.594, -0.924 ] -> ( -0.924 -1.208 +2.594 -0.924 ) = -0.462 /4 = -0.1155\n        hour7: [ -0.320, -1.208, 3.340, -0.071 ] -> ( -0.320 -1.208 +3.340 -0.071 ) = 1.741 /4 = 0.43525\n        hour8: [ -0.426, -1.244, 0.249, -1.350 ] -> ( -0.426 -1.244 +0.249 -1.350 ) = -2.771 /4 = -0.69275\n        hour9: [ -1.102, -0.853, 0.071, -0.711 ] -> ( -1.102 -0.853 +0.071 -0.711 ) = -2.595 /4 = -0.64875\n        hour10: [ -1.777, -0.640, 0.249, 0.320 ] -> ( -1.777 -0.640 +0.249 +0.320 ) = -1.848 /4 = -0.462\n        hour11: [ -1.670, -0.782, 0.249, 1.137 ] -> ( -1.670 -0.782 +0.249 +1.137 ) = -1.066 /4 = -0.2665\n        hour12: [ -2.239, -1.848, -0.249, -0.249 ] -> ( -2.239 -1.848 -0.249 -0.249 ) = -4.585 /4 = -1.14625\n        hour13: [ -1.812, -1.457, 0.604, 0.178 ] -> ( -1.812 -1.457 +0.604 +0.178 ) = -2.487 /4 = -0.62175\n        hour14: [ -1.066, -1.635, -0.071, 0.071 ] -> ( -1.066 -1.635 -0.071 +0.071 ) = -2.701 /4 = -0.67525\n        hour15: [ -0.711, -1.492, -0.497, -0.497 ] -> ( -0.711 -1.492 -0.497 -0.497 ) = -3.197 /4 = -0.79925\n        hour16: [ -1.954, -1.706, -1.492, -1.315 ] -> ( -1.954 -1.706 -1.492 -1.315 ) = -6.467 /4 = -1.61675\n        hour17: [ -2.310, -2.416, -1.777, -1.421 ] -> ( -2.310 -2.416 -1.777 -1.421 ) = -7.924 /4 = -1.981\n        hour18: [ -3.020, -2.772, -2.203, -2.168 ] -> ( -3.020 -2.772 -2.203 -2.168 ) = -10.163 /4 = -2.54075\n        hour19: [ -2.949, -2.807, -2.203, -2.274 ] -> ( -2.949 -2.807 -2.203 -2.274 ) = -10.233 /4 = -2.55825\n        hour20: [ -3.020, 0.213, -2.132, -2.345 ] -> ( -3.020 +0.213 -2.132 -2.345 ) = -7.284 /4 = -1.821\n        hour21: [ -1.564, 0.071, -2.559, -2.949 ] -> ( -1.564 +0.071 -2.559 -2.949 ) = -7.001 /4 = -1.75025\n        hour22: [ -1.386, 0.817, -1.528, -1.812 ] -> ( -1.386 +0.817 -1.528 -1.812 ) = -3.909 /4 = -0.97725\n        hour23: [ -0.213, 2.878, -0.497, 0.249 ] -> ( -0.213 +2.878 -0.497 +0.249 ) = 2.417 /4 = 0.60425\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-26, Sunday): \n            00:00:00 -> 0.22225\n            01:00:00 -> 0.2845\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.60425\n\n        Day2 (2017-02-27, Monday): same pattern\n        Day3 (2017-02-28, Tuesday): same pattern\n        Day4 (2017-03-01, Wednesday): same pattern\n\n   But note: the last day in the history is 2017-02-25 (Saturday) and the next day is 2017-02-26 (Sunday). We are generating 4 days: 2017-02-26, 2017-02-27, 2017-02-28, 2017-03-01.\n\n   We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-26 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-02-25 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-02-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-01 23:00:00.\n\n   How many? 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        start_date = '2017-02-26 00:00:00'\n        end_date = '2017-03-01 23:00:00'\n\n        We can generate with pd.date_range(start='2017-02-26 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n\n   But we are not coding, we are just writing the output.\n\n   We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast.

But the problem says \"complete data\", so we write all.\n\n   But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n   So we write 96 lines.\n\n   We'll format the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. But the computed averages have more. We'll round to 3 decimal places? \n\n   The input data had 3 decimal places. So we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: 0.22225 -> 0.222\n        hour1: 0.2845 -> 0.285\n        ... \n\n   But note: the problem does not specify the precision. We'll use 3 decimal places to match the input.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output with the same precision as the input? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Revised averages:\n\n        hour0: 0.222\n        hour1: 0.285\n        hour2: 0.427\n        hour3: 0.151\n        hour4: -0.480\n        (because -0.4795 rounds to -0.480? Actually, -0.4795 is exactly -0.480 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n         But note: rounding -0.4795: \n             The digit in the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal? But negative? \n             Actually, the rule is:\n                 -0.4795: absolute value 0.4795 -> round to 0.480, then negative: -0.480.\n\n         Similarly, -0.16875: \n             absolute 0.16875 -> round to 0.169 -> negative: -0.169.\n\n        Let me recalc with rounding to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: ( -0.782 -0.462 +2.630 -0.497 ) = 0.889 -> 0.889/4 = 0.22225 -> round to 0.222\n        hour1: 0.2845 -> 0.284 (if we round half to even? 0.2845: the 4th digit is 5 and the 3rd is even? 4 is even -> round to 0.284? \n        Actually, 0.2845: \n            The digit in the 3rd decimal is 4, the next is 5 -> round up: 0.285.\n\n        We'll use standard rounding: round half up? \n\n        But note: Python's default rounding is round half to even. However, the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        We'll use 3 decimal places and round half up? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the exact value? But the input has 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n            hour0: 0.22225 -> 0.222 (if we round to 3 decimals: 0.222)\n            hour1: 0.2845 -> 0.285 (because 0.2845: 4 is the third decimal, and the next is 5 -> round up to 0.285)\n\n        But note: 0.2845 is exactly halfway between 0.284 and 0.285? Actually, no: 0.2845 is 2845/10000, which is 0.2845. \n        The rule for round half up: if the next digit is >=5, then round up.\n\n        So:\n\n            hour0: 0.22225 -> 0.222 (because 2 in the 4th decimal is <5)\n            hour1: 0.2845 -> 0.285 (because 5 in the 4th decimal -> round up)\n\n        Similarly, hour4: -0.4795 -> round to 3 decimals: \n            The absolute value is 0.4795 -> round to 0.480 -> so -0.480.\n\n        Let's recalc all with rounding to 3 decimals (using round half up):\n\n        We'll recalc:\n\n        hour0: 0.22225 -> 0.222\n        hour1: 0.2845 -> 0.285\n        hour2: 0.4265 -> 0.427\n        hour3: 0.151 -> 0.151\n        hour4: -0.4795 -> -0.480\n        hour5: -0.16875 -> -0.169\n        hour6: -0.1155 -> -0.116\n        hour7: 0.43525 -> 0.435\n        hour8: -0.69275 -> -0.693\n        hour9: -0.64875 -> -0.649\n        hour10: -0.462 -> -0.462   (exactly -0.462)\n        hour11: -0.2665 -> -0.267\n        hour12: -1.14625 -> -1.146\n        hour13: -0.62175 -> -0.622\n        hour14: -0.67525 -> -0.675\n        hour15: -0.79925 -> -0.799\n        hour16: -1.61675 -> -1.617\n        hour17: -1.981 -> -1.981\n        hour18: -2.54075 -> -2.541\n        hour19: -2.55825 -> -2.558\n        hour20: -1.821 -> -1.821\n        hour21: -1.75025 -> -1.750\n        hour22: -0.97725 -> -0.977\n        hour23: 0.60425 -> 0.604\n\n   Now we write the forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-26\n            00:00:00  0.222\n            01:00:00  0.285\n            02:00:00  0.427\n            03:00:00  0.151\n            04:00:00 -0.480\n            05:00:00 -0.169\n            06:00:00 -0.116\n            07:00:00  0.435\n            08:00:00 -0.693\n            09:00:00 -0.649\n            10:00:00 -0.462\n            11:00:00 -0.267\n            12:00:00 -1.146\n            13:00:00 -0.622\n            14:00:00 -0.675\n            15:00:00 -0.799\n            16:00:00 -1.617\n            17:00:00 -1.981\n            18:00:00 -2.541\n            19:00:00 -2.558\n            20:00:00 -1.821\n            21:00:00 -1.750\n            22:00:00 -0.977\n            23:00:00  0.604\n\n        Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-26 00:00:00 to 2017-02-26 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-02-27 00:00:00 to 2017-02-27 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2017-02-28 00:00:00 to 2017-02-28 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-03-01 00:00:00 to 2017-03-01 23:00:00\n\n   We'll write the data in the same format as the input: two columns: date and MULL.\n\n   We must write 96 lines.\n\n   Let's do it in the answer block.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.

In practice, we might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Prophet, etc.) but given the short history and the requirement to forecast 96 steps, and without the ability to run complex model training, we use this simple average.\n\n   Also note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. We assumed the next 96 are to be forecasted without gaps.\n\n   We output the complete 96 lines.\n\n   Let me double-check the number of lines: 4 days * 24 = 96, and we have 96 lines.\n\n   We are done.\n",
