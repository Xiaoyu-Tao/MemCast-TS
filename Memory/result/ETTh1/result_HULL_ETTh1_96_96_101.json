        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values in the dataset. However, for forecasting, we must handle the given data appropriately.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the data shows some patterns (daily seasonality, as it's hourly data) and potential non-stationarity, we can consider models like:\n    - SARIMA (with seasonal component) or SARIMAX\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) \n    - Prophet by Facebook\n    - LSTM if we were to use deep learning, but given the small data (only 96 points) and the requirement for a quick forecast, we might avoid that.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has negative values? Yes, so we must choose a model that can handle negative values (so multiplicative seasonality might not be appropriate in some models).\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points (which is a lot relative to the history), we must be cautious.\n\n 6. We'll use a model that can capture seasonality. Let's try to use a seasonal decomposition and then model the components, but with only 4 days of data, the seasonality might be daily (period=24).\n\n 7. But note: we have 4 days (96 hours) and we are to forecast 4 days. We can try to fit a model with daily seasonality.\n\n 8. We'll use the `statsmodels` library for SARIMA. However, the data is short and we are forecasting a long horizon, so we might also consider a simpler model.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a model that uses the last day as a template and adjust with recent trends? But the data shows variability.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will use a SARIMA model with parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). We have to choose the parameters.\n\n 11. We can do a grid search for the best parameters? But with only 96 points, we can try too many. We'll use a simple set.\n\n 12. Steps for SARIMA:\n     - Check stationarity: if not stationary, take differences (d and D).\n     - We might need to difference once (d=1) and seasonal difference (D=1) with period 24.\n\n 13. We can also consider using auto_arima from pmdarima to find the best parameters? But since we are in a simulated environment, we'll have to do without.\n\n 14. Given the time, we'll choose a model: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1,24). We choose d=0 because the data might be stationary? Let's check:\n\n     The data over 4 days: \n        Day1: [1.005, 1.139, ... , 0.402]\n        Day2: [0.536, 1.808, ... , 1.875]\n        Day3: [3.081, 2.880, ... , 0.603]\n        Day4: [1.474, 1.808, ... , 0.670]\n\n     The mean and variance might be changing? We see a spike on day3. So we might need differencing.\n\n 15. We'll try to use d=1 and D=1 (for non-stationary and seasonal non-stationary) and then use p=1, q=1, P=1, Q=1.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? But that would ignore trends and recent changes.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we'll use a model and then generate the forecast.\n\n 18. We'll use `statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX` to model the data.\n\n 19. Steps in code (if we were to code) but since we are to output the forecast, we must generate the next 96 dates and the forecasted HULL.\n\n 20. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? We are given 96 points without any gap? The dates are consecutive.\n\n 21. We are to output the next 96 dates: starting from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n 22. We must provide the complete data in the same format.\n\n 23. Since we cannot run code in this environment, we have to simulate the process. But note: the problem expects a complete set of 96 forecasted values.\n\n 24. We'll generate the next 96 dates and then provide the forecast. However, as an AI, I can simulate having run a model and then output the forecast.\n\n 25. But wait: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we have to output 96 lines of forecast.\n\n 26. Given the constraints, I will use a precomputed forecast using a standard method. However, without actual computation, I cannot provide accurate numbers.\n\n 27. Alternative: Since the problem is to test the ability to generate a forecast, and we are to output the data, I will generate a forecast by:\n\n     a) Taking the average of each hour across the 4 days we have, and then adjust by the last day's trend? \n\n     b) But note: the data has a clear daily pattern? Let's look at the first day: \n        00:00: 1.005, 01:00: 1.139, ... 23:00: 0.402\n        second day: 0.536, 1.808, ... 1.875\n        third day: 3.081, 2.880, ... 0.603\n        fourth day: 1.474, 1.808, ... 0.670\n\n     We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.005 + 0.536 + 3.081 + 1.474)/4 = 1.524\n        hour1: (1.139 + 1.808 + 2.880 + 1.808)/4 = 1.90875\n\n     But we see that the third day is higher. Also, the last day (day4) is the 12th, and we are forecasting the 13th to 16th.\n\n     c) We can also consider a weighted average? Or use exponential smoothing for the daily pattern.\n\n 28. However, we also note that there might be a downward trend from day3 to day4? So we might adjust the average by a trend factor.\n\n 29. Given the complexity and without running actual code, we decide to use the average of the last two days for each hour? Because the last two days might be more representative.\n\n 30. But the problem requires 96 points, so we can generate 4 days of the same as the average of the last 4 days? But that would be 24*4=96.\n\n 31. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days? But that ignores any trend.\n\n 32. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-12) as a base and then adjust by the difference between the last day and the previous day? \n\n 33. We'll do:\n\n     Let D0 = 2017-08-09, D1=2017-08-10, D2=2017-08-11, D3=2017-08-12.\n\n     For each hour h in 0..23:\n\n        base = D3[h]   # the last day's value at hour h\n        # trend: (D3[h] - D2[h])  -> the change from D2 to D3 at hour h\n\n        Then for the next day D4 (2017-08-13) at hour h: \n            forecast = base + (D3[h] - D2[h])   # but this is a naive trend\n\n        Then for D5: we would use the same trend? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 34. Since we are forecasting 4 days, we can do:\n\n        Day4 (2017-08-13): for hour h, value = D3[h] + (D3[h] - D2[h])\n        Day5 (2017-08-14): for hour h, value = Day4[h] + (D3[h] - D2[h])   # same trend\n        ... \n\n     But this might lead to unbounded growth? And we see that the differences can be negative.\n\n 35. Alternatively, we can use the average trend over the last 3 days? \n\n     For hour h: \n        trend_h = ( (D1[h]-D0[h]) + (D2[h]-D1[h]) + (D3[h]-D2[h]) ) / 3\n\n     Then for the next day at hour h: \n        D4[h] = D3[h] + trend_h\n\n     Then D5[h] = D4[h] + trend_h, etc.\n\n 36. But note: we only have 4 days, so we can compute the trend from D0 to D3? \n\n        overall_trend = (D3[h] - D0[h]) / 3   # per day\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we project:\n\n        D4[h] = D3[h] + overall_trend\n        D5[h] = D4[h] + overall_trend\n        D6[h] = D5[h] + overall_trend\n        D7[h] = D6[h] + overall_trend\n\n 37. However, the overall_trend might be negative? \n\n 38. Let's test for hour0:\n\n        D0: 1.005\n        D1: 0.536\n        D2: 3.081\n        D3: 1.474\n\n        overall_trend = (1.474 - 1.005) / 3 = 0.469/3 = 0.1563\n\n        Then D4: 1.474 + 0.1563 = 1.6303\n        D5: 1.6303 + 0.1563 = 1.7866\n        D6: 1.7866 + 0.1563 = 1.9429\n        D7: 1.9429 + 0.1563 = 2.0992\n\n     But the data at hour0 has been fluctuating, so this linear trend might not be appropriate.\n\n 39. Given the complexity and without a proper model, we decide to use the average of the last 4 days for each hour for the next 4 days. This is a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n     For each hour h (0 to 23) in the day, we compute:\n\n        avg_h = (D0[h] + D1[h] + D2[h] + D3[h]) / 4\n\n     Then the forecast for the next 4 days at the same hour will be avg_h.\n\n 40. This method will give us 24 distinct values, repeated for 4 days.\n\n 41. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.005 + 0.536 + 3.081 + 1.474) / 4 = 6.096/4 = 1.524\n        hour1: (1.139 + 1.808 + 2.880 + 1.808) / 4 = 7.635/4 = 1.90875\n        hour2: (0.804 + 0.670 + 2.746 + 2.143) / 4 = 6.363/4 = 1.59075\n        hour3: (0.871 + 0.871 + 2.076 + 1.608) / 4 = 5.426/4 = 1.3565\n        hour4: (0.536 + 0.469 + 2.746 + 1.340) / 4 = 5.091/4 = 1.27275\n        hour5: (0.804 + 1.206 + 1.407 + 0.536) / 4 = 3.953/4 = 0.98825\n        hour6: (0.000 + 0.737 + 1.942 + 0.871) / 4 = 3.55/4 = 0.8875\n        hour7: (0.536 + 1.206 + 2.411 + 1.072) / 4 = 5.225/4 = 1.30625\n        hour8: (1.741 + 2.009 + 1.608 + 0.402) / 4 = 5.76/4 = 1.44\n        hour9: (1.340 + 2.746 + 1.340 + 0.938) / 4 = 6.364/4 = 1.591\n        hour10: (1.407 + 4.555 + 1.942 + 1.072) / 4 = 8.976/4 = 2.244\n        hour11: (1.942 + 3.349 + 4.354 + 0.670) / 4 = 10.315/4 = 2.57875\n        hour12: (1.474 + 4.153 + 2.679 + 0.067) / 4 = 8.373/4 = 2.09325\n        hour13: (0.938 + 4.488 + 1.072 + -0.201) / 4 = 6.297/4 = 1.57425\n        hour14: (1.340 + 4.354 + 1.741 + -0.268) / 4 = 7.167/4 = 1.79175\n        hour15: (1.072 + 2.545 + 1.340 + -0.067) / 4 = 4.89/4 = 1.2225\n        hour16: (0.134 + 1.674 + 0.737 + 0.134) / 4 = 2.679/4 = 0.66975\n        hour17: (0.000 + 0.469 + 0.469 + 0.000) / 4 = 0.938/4 = 0.2345\n        hour18: (0.000 + -0.268 + 0.201 + -0.469) / 4 = -0.536/4 = -0.134\n        hour19: (-0.737 + -0.067 + 0.603 + -1.340) / 4 = -1.541/4 = -0.38525\n        hour20: (0.000 + 0.402 + 1.139 + -0.737) / 4 = 0.804/4 = 0.201\n        hour21: (-0.603 + 0.268 + 0.469 + -1.072) / 4 = -0.938/4 = -0.2345\n        hour22: (0.000 + 1.072 + 0.804 + 0.000) / 4 = 1.876/4 = 0.469\n        hour23: (0.402 + 1.875 + 0.603 + 0.670) / 4 = 3.55/4 = 0.8875\n\n 42. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-08-13 to 2017-08-16) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-08-13): [1.524, 1.90875, 1.59075, ... , 0.8875]\n        Day2 (2017-08-14): same as Day1\n        Day3 (2017-08-15): same as Day1\n        Day4 (2017-08-16): same as Day1\n\n 43. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not encountered in the provided 96, so we assume the forecast is complete.\n\n 44. We must generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-13 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n 45. We'll output 96 lines.\n\n 46. However, note: this method ignores any trend and recent changes. But it is a simple and common method for seasonal data.\n\n 47. We'll output the data in the required format.\n\n 48. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-08-13 00:00:00  1.524\n2017-08-13 01:00:00  1.90875\n2017-08-13 02:00:00  1.59075\n2017-08-13 03:00:00  1.3565\n2017-08-13 04:00:00  1.27275\n2017-08-13 05:00:00  0.98825\n2017-08-13 06:00:00  0.8875\n2017-08-13 07:00:00  1.30625\n2017-08-13 08:00:00  1.44\n2017-08-13 09:00:00  1.591\n2017-08-13 10:00:00  2.244\n2017-08-13 11:00:00  2.57875\n2017-08-13 12:00:00  2.09325\n2017-08-13 13:00:00  1.57425\n2017-08-13 14:00:00  1.79175\n2017-08-13 15:00:00  1.2225\n2017-08-13 16:00:00  0.66975\n2017-08-13 17:00:00  0.2345\n2017-08-13 18:00:00  -0.134\n2017-08-13 19:00:00  -0.38525\n2017-08-13 20:00:00  0.201\n2017-08-13 21:00:00  -0.2345\n2017-08-13 22:00:00  0.469\n2017-08-13 23:00:00  0.8875\n2017-08-14 00:00:00  1.524\n2017-08-14 01:00:00  1.90875\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 49. We'll write the full 96 lines.\n\n 50. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We'll round to 3 decimal places to match.\n\n 51. However, the original data had up to 3 decimal places? Let's check: \n        1.005, 1.139, ... 0.536, 0.804, ... 0.000, ... 1.741, ... 4.555, ... 0.134, ... -0.737, ... -0.603, ... 0.402.\n\n     So we'll round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 52. Rounding:\n\n        hour0: 1.524 -> 1.524\n        hour1: 1.90875 -> 1.909 (if rounded to 3 decimals) but note: 1.90875 rounded to 3 decimals is 1.909? \n            Actually, 1.90875: \n                The fourth decimal is 7, which is >=5, so we round up: 1.909\n\n        We'll round each average to 3 decimal places.\n\n 53. Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: 1.524 -> 1.524\n        hour1: 1.90875 -> 1.909\n        hour2: 1.59075 -> 1.591\n        hour3: 1.3565 -> 1.357 (because 1.3565 -> 1.357? Actually, 1.3565: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the 6 to 7 -> 1.357)\n        hour4: 1.27275 -> 1.273\n        hour5: 0.98825 -> 0.988\n        hour6: 0.8875 -> 0.888 (because 0.8875 -> 0.888? Yes, because 0.8875 is exactly halfway, but typically we round to the nearest even? However, common practice: 0.8875 -> 0.888)\n        hour7: 1.30625 -> 1.306\n        because: 1.30625 -> look at the fourth decimal (2) and fifth (5) -> actually, 1.30625: \n            The fourth decimal is 2, then 5 -> we round up the 6 to 7? No, wait: \n            The number is 1.30625, we want 3 decimals: \n                The digit in the third decimal is 6, the next is 2 which is less than 5, so we leave 6 -> 1.306? \n            But wait, 1.30625: \n                The fourth decimal is 2, so we do not round up the third decimal? So 1.306.\n\n        However, let me check: \n            1.30625: \n                We are to round to 3 decimals: \n                Look at the fourth decimal: 2 -> which is <5, so we leave the third decimal as 6 -> 1.306.\n\n        But note: 0.8875: \n            The third decimal is 7 (after the decimal: 8,8,7,5). \n            We are rounding to 3: so we look at the fourth decimal: 5 -> then we round up the 7 to 8 -> 0.888.\n\n        So:\n\n            hour0: 1.524\n            hour1: 1.909\n            hour2: 1.591\n            hour3: 1.357\n            hour4: 1.273\n            hour5: 0.988\n            hour6: 0.888\n            hour7: 1.306\n            hour8: 1.440\n            hour9: 1.591\n            hour10: 2.244 -> 2.244\n            hour11: 2.579 (because 2.57875 -> 2.579)\n            hour12: 2.093 (2.09325 -> 2.093)\n            hour13: 1.574 (1.57425 -> 1.574)\n            hour14: 1.792 (1.79175 -> 1.792)\n            hour15: 1.223 (1.2225 -> 1.223) because 1.2225: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the 2 to 3? \n                Actually, 1.2225: \n                    The third decimal is 2, the fourth is 5 -> we round up the second 2? \n                    But note: the number is 1.2225: \n                        We look at the fourth decimal: 5 -> then we round up the third decimal (which is 2) to 3? \n                    So 1.223.\n            hour16: 0.670 (0.66975 -> 0.670)\n            hour17: 0.2345 -> 0.234 (if we round to 3 decimals: 0.2345 -> the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the 4 to 5? \n                    But 0.2345: \n                        The third decimal is 4, the fourth is 5 -> round up the 4 to 5 -> 0.235)\n            Let me recalc: 0.2345 * 10000 = 2345 -> rounding to 3 decimals: \n                We are at 0.2345: \n                    The digit in the thousandths place is 4, the next is 5 -> so we add 1 to the 4 -> 0.235.\n\n            hour18: -0.134 -> -0.134\n            hour19: -0.38525 -> -0.385 (because the fourth decimal is 2, so we leave it as -0.385)\n            hour20: 0.201 -> 0.201\n            hour21: -0.2345 -> -0.234 (if we round: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the 4 to 5? \n                    But negative: \n                    The absolute value: 0.2345 -> rounded to 0.235, then negative: -0.235)\n            hour22: 0.469 -> 0.469\n            hour23: 0.8875 -> 0.888\n\n 54. We must be consistent. We'll round to 3 decimal places using the standard rule: \n        If the digit in the 4th decimal is 5 or more, we round up the 3rd decimal by one.\n\n 55.
