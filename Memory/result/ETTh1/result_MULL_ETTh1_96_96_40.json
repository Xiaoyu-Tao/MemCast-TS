        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the data has missing values pattern? Actually, in the provided data, we see zeros and negative values, but no explicit NaNs. \n But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". In the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing (NaN) but the values are given as 0.000 in many places.\n\n Since the problem states there are missing values, we must handle them. But in the provided 96 points, there are no NaNs. \n However, we are to forecast the next 96 points and we must be cautious that the future data might have missing? \n But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we are to generate 96 points without any missing.\n\n Approach:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations). \n 2. We can use a time series forecasting method that can handle the pattern and also account for potential seasonality.\n\n However, the data provided is only 96 points (4 days). This is a very short history. \n\n Steps:\n - We will use a model that can capture daily seasonality. Since we have 24 data points per day, the seasonality period is 24.\n - We can use models like SARIMA, but with only 4 days, it might be challenging to fit a seasonal model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n   - Compute the average of each hour across the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n   But note: the data does not look exactly the same every day. Also, we have negative values and zeros.\n\n Another idea: use an automated forecasting model that can handle short time series, such as Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) or a simple moving average.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a robust method.\n\n Considering the short history, we can try:\n   - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive seasonality and trend) because we have a seasonality of 24.\n\n But note: the data has a very short history (only 4 days). We can try to fit a model and then forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data has a pattern that might be changing. Also, the last day (2016-12-11) has negative values and a drop.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last day (2016-12-11) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have 4 days to forecast.\n\n But the problem says: we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Since the data is very short, we can see that the pattern is not consistent. We might need to use a model that can capture the daily pattern and the trend.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to output the data in the code block.\n\n However, we are not coding but providing the forecast. We must generate 96 numbers.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n 1. We decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n 2. But with only 4 days, the seasonal component can be estimated by averaging each hour over the 4 days? \n    However, the 4 days are not complete? Actually, we have 4 full days (24*4=96 points).\n\n 3. We can calculate the average for each hour of the day:\n\n    hour0: average of [2016-12-08 00:00:00, 2016-12-09 00:00:00, 2016-12-10 00:00:00, 2016-12-11 00:00:00] \n        = (0.000, 3.482, 2.665, -0.391) -> (0+3.482+2.665-0.391)/4 = 5.756/4 = 1.439\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n 4. But note: the data has a trend? The last day is lower. We might need to adjust for trend.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-11) as the base and then adjust by the average seasonal component? \n\n However, let's look at the data: \n   Day1: 2016-12-08: starts at 0 and then increases, then decreases at the end? \n   Day2: 2016-12-09: starts at 3.482 and then goes down? \n   Day3: 2016-12-10: starts at 2.665, then goes up and down? \n   Day4: 2016-12-11: starts at -0.391 and then mostly negative.\n\n There is a downward trend? \n\n 6. We can compute the overall trend by linear regression on the entire series? Then remove the trend, compute the seasonal indices, and then forecast by adding the trend and seasonal.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n   a) Fit a linear regression: time index (0 to 95) as X, MULL as y. Then get the slope and intercept.\n   b) Compute the detrended series: y - (intercept + slope * time)\n   c) For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average detrended value for that hour across the 4 days -> seasonal indices.\n   d) Then for the next 96 points (time index 96 to 191), \n        forecast = intercept + slope * (96+i) + seasonal_index[i % 24]\n\n But note: the trend might not be linear? And with only 4 days, the trend might be overfitted.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days as the base and then add the seasonal component? \n\n Given the complexity and the short data, I will use the method of:\n\n   - Calculate the seasonal indices (without detrending) and then use the last day's values as the starting point and then apply the seasonal indices as a daily pattern? \n\n But note: the last day (2016-12-11) is very different. \n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the last two days for each hour? But we have 4 days.\n\n 9. Since the problem says we must provide the data, and we are experts, we can use a simple average of the 4 days for each hour? \n\n    Let F(t) for hour h (0<=h<24) = average of the MULL at hour h for the 4 days.\n\n    Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n        Day1: F(0), F(1), ... F(23)\n        Day2: F(0), F(1), ... F(23)\n        Day3: F(0), F(1), ... F(23)\n        Day4: F(0), F(1), ... F(23)\n\n 10. But this ignores any trend. However, the last day was negative and the first day was positive. The average might be a compromise.\n\n 11. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll group by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and take the mean.\n\n 12. However, we have 4 days. We can compute the mean for each hour:\n\n     hour0: (0.000 + 3.482 + 2.665 + (-0.391)) / 4 = (0+3.482+2.665-0.391)/4 = 5.756/4 = 1.439\n     hour1: (0.000 + 3.376 + 2.843 + (-0.320)) / 4 = (0+3.376+2.843-0.320)/4 = 5.899/4 = 1.47475\n     ... and so on.\n\n 13. But note: the data has negative values and zeros. This method will produce a fixed pattern for every day.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But we only have 4 points per hour.\n\n 15. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 numbers, we will compute the mean for each hour of the day and then repeat that for 4 days.\n\n 16. Steps:\n\n     - Extract the hour of the day for each record.\n     - Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n 17. But note: the data provided is exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can reshape the MULL into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the days.\n\n 18. Let's do:\n\n        import numpy as np   [but we were not allowed to code? We have to output the data]\n\n     We can do it manually? That would be tedious. But we are to provide the forecast.\n\n 19. Since we are to provide the data, we can compute the 24 hourly means and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 20. However, the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing. So we can use the provided 96 points to compute the 24 means.\n\n 21. But note: the last day is very different. The average might be pulled down by the last day.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the median per hour? That might be more robust.\n\n 23. Given the time, we decide to use the mean per hour.\n\n 24. We'll compute the mean for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     hour0: (0.000, 3.482, 2.665, -0.391) -> mean = (0.000+3.482+2.665-0.391)/4 = 5.756/4 = 1.439\n     hour1: (0.000, 3.376, 2.843, -0.320) -> (0.000+3.376+2.843-0.320)=5.899 -> 1.47475\n     hour2: (0.000, 2.559, 2.239, -0.426) -> (0+2.559+2.239-0.426)=4.372 -> 1.093\n     hour3: (0.000, 3.056, 3.056, 0.249) -> (0+3.056+3.056+0.249)=6.361 -> 1.59025\n     hour4: (0.000, 3.234, 2.310, 0.178) -> (0+3.234+2.310+0.178)=5.722 -> 1.4305\n     hour5: (0.000, 1.848, 2.310, 0.000) -> (0+1.848+2.310+0)=4.158 -> 1.0395\n     hour6: (0.000, 2.132, 1.883, -1.137) -> (0+2.132+1.883-1.137)=2.878 -> 0.7195\n     hour7: (0.000, 1.777, 2.168, -0.853) -> (0+1.777+2.168-0.853)=3.092 -> 0.773\n     hour8: (1.741, 2.345, 2.772, 0.000) -> (1.741+2.345+2.772+0)=6.858 -> 1.7145\n     hour9: (-0.071, 1.777, 2.061, -0.497) -> (-0.071+1.777+2.061-0.497)=3.27 -> 0.8175\n     hour10: (1.919, 1.350, 2.630, -0.569) -> (1.919+1.350+2.630-0.569)=5.33 -> 1.3325\n     hour11: (0.853, 1.848, 1.990, -0.711) -> (0.853+1.848+1.990-0.711)=3.98 -> 0.995\n     hour12: (0.853, 1.528, 1.528, -1.564) -> (0.853+1.528+1.528-1.564)=2.345 -> 0.58625\n     hour13: (1.564, 1.954, 2.168, -1.031) -> (1.564+1.954+2.168-1.031)=4.655 -> 1.16375\n     hour14: (1.244, 2.097, 2.594, -0.817) -> (1.244+2.097+2.594-0.817)=5.118 -> 1.2795\n     hour15: (1.883, 1.706, 2.061, -0.533) -> (1.883+1.706+2.061-0.533)=5.117 -> 1.27925\n     hour16: (2.772, 1.315, 2.594, -0.640) -> (2.772+1.315+2.594-0.640)=6.041 -> 1.51025\n     hour17: (1.919, 1.350, 1.564, -1.315) -> (1.919+1.350+1.564-1.315)=3.518 -> 0.8795\n     hour18: (1.812, 2.381, 0.924, -1.919) -> (1.812+2.381+0.924-1.919)=3.198 -> 0.7995\n     hour19: (1.564, 1.954, 0.746, -1.777) -> (1.564+1.954+0.746-1.777)=2.487 -> 0.62175\n     hour20: (1.599, 1.457, 0.782, -1.883) -> (1.599+1.457+0.782-1.883)=1.955 -> 0.48875\n     hour21: (0.604, 1.599, 0.000, -1.954) -> (0.604+1.599+0-1.954)=0.249 -> 0.06225\n     hour22: (1.599, 1.777, 3.127, -1.173) -> (1.599+1.777+3.127-1.173)=5.33 -> 1.3325\n     hour23: (2.594, 2.132, -0.426, 0.284) -> (2.594+2.132-0.426+0.284)=4.584 -> 1.146\n\n 25. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-12-12): \n            00:00:00 -> 1.439\n            01:00:00 -> 1.47475\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 1.146\n\n        Day2 (2016-12-13): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (2016-12-14): same\n        Day4 (2016-12-15): same\n\n 26. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are generating a complete forecast without missing.\n\n 27. However, we must output the data in the same format as the input, with the date and the MULL.\n\n 28. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-12 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2016-12-15 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n\n 29. We have the 24 means as above. We'll round to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n 30. Let's list the 24 means (hour0 to hour23) with rounding to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 1.439 -> 1.439\n        hour1: 1.47475 -> 1.475\n        hour2: 1.093 -> 1.093\n        hour3: 1.59025 -> 1.590\n        hour4: 1.4305 -> 1.430\n        hour5: 1.0395 -> 1.040\n        hour6: 0.7195 -> 0.720\n        hour7: 0.773 -> 0.773\n        hour8: 1.7145 -> 1.714\n        hour9: 0.8175 -> 0.818\n        hour10: 1.3325 -> 1.333\n        hour11: 0.995 -> 0.995\n        hour12: 0.58625 -> 0.586\n        hour13: 1.16375 -> 1.164\n        hour14: 1.2795 -> 1.280\n        hour15: 1.27925 -> 1.279\n        hour16: 1.51025 -> 1.510\n        hour17: 0.8795 -> 0.880\n        hour18: 0.7995 -> 0.800\n        hour19: 0.62175 -> 0.622\n        hour20: 0.48875 -> 0.489\n        hour21: 0.06225 -> 0.062\n        hour22: 1.3325 -> 1.333\n        hour23: 1.146 -> 1.146\n\n 31. Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 32. Now, we write the output in the required format.\n\n 33. The dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-12 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-12-12 01:00:00 ... until 2016-12-12 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-12-13 00:00:00 ... until 2016-12-13 23:00:00\n        ... until 2016-12-15 23:00:00\n\n 34. We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n 35. The MULL values: \n        First 24: [1.439, 1.475, 1.093, 1.590, 1.430, 1.040, 0.720, 0.773, 1.714, 0.818, 1.333, 0.995, 0.586, 1.164, 1.280, 1.279, 1.510, 0.880, 0.800, 0.622, 0.489, 0.062, 1.333, 1.146]\n        Then repeat 3 more times.\n\n 36. But note: the last day in the history (2016-12-11) had a drop. Our forecast is using the average of 4 days, which includes that drop. \n     This might be acceptable.\n\n 37. We must output the data in the exact same format.\n\n 38. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-12 00:00:00  1.439\n2016-12-12 01:00:00  1.475\n... \n2016-12-15 23:00:00  1.146\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 39. We'll generate the 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 40. However, note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are not given any in the history, and we are to forecast without missing? \n     So we output all 96 points.\n\n 41. Let's write the data.\n\n 42. We have the 24 values for one day:\n\n        values = [\n            1.439, 1.475, 1.093, 1.590, 1.430, 1.040, 0.720, 0.773, \n            1.714, 0.818, 1.333, 0.995, 0.586, 1.164, 1.280, 1.279, \n            1.510, 0.880, 0.800, 0.622, 0.489, 0.062, 1.333, 1.146\n        ]\n\n 43. Then for 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 44. The dates:\n\n        day1: 2016-12-12\n        day2: 2016-12-13\n        day3: 2016-12-14\n        day4: 2016-12-15\n\n 45. We'll generate:\n\n        for day in [12,13,14,15]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = f\"2016-12-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n 46. But note: the day must be two digits: 12,13,14,15 are all two digits.\n\n 47. We output the date and then the value (with 3 decimal places).\n\n 48. Let's do it in the answer block.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We are providing 96 lines.\n\n Let's write the first 5 and last 5:\n\n        First 5:\n            2016-12-12 00:00:00  1.439\n            2016-12-12 01:00:00  1.475\n            2016-12-12 02:00:00  1.093\n            2016-12-12 03:00:00  1.590\n            2016-12-12 04:00:00  1.430\n\n        Last 5:\n            2016-12-15 19:00:00  0.622\n            2016-12-15 20:00:00  0.489\n            2016-12-15 21:00:00  0.062\n            2016-12-15 22:00:00  1.333\n            2016-12-15 23:00:00  1.146\n\n 49.
