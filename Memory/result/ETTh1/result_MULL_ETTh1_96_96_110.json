        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). Also, there might be weekly patterns but we only have 4 days (so we don't have a full week of data). However, we can use the daily pattern.\n\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, we are told that the data may have missing values. Since the provided data is complete, we proceed to model.\n\n 3. We choose a model: Given the seasonality and the relatively short history, we can use a seasonal model. One common approach is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing with seasonality (like Holt-Winters).\n\n 4. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily seasonality (period=24)\n    - The data does not show a clear trend (it oscillates around zero) but we see daily peaks and troughs.\n\n 5. We will use the SARIMA model. We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). We have limited data (only 96 points) so we cannot use very complex models.\n\n 6. We can try to automatically select the best SARIMA parameters using an information criterion (like AIC) but due to the small data size, we can also try a simple model.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive method: using the last available day (or the average of the last few days) as the forecast. However, the problem requires forecasting 96 points and we have 4 days of history. We can take the average of the 4 days for each hour and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the data might have a weekly pattern and we don't have a full week. Also, the data from 14th to 17th of September 2017: 14th (Thursday), 15th (Friday), 16th (Saturday), 17th (Sunday). The next 4 days would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? Actually, 18th is Monday, 19th Tuesday, 20th Wednesday, 21st Thursday.\n\n 8. Since we have only 4-day history and the days are of different types (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and the next 4 days are Monday to Thursday, we cannot directly use the same-day from the previous week. We don't have Monday data in the history.\n\n 9. Therefore, we might use a model that captures the daily seasonality and the recent pattern.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we are not going to build a very complex model. We can use:\n     - A seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component by repeating the last season? But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? But note: the days are different types. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Sunday) for Monday? That might not be appropriate.\n\n 11. We can use a simple average of the 4 days for each hour. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 12. However, we note that the data might have a trend? Let's check: \n     - The values on 2017-09-14: from 0.462 to -1.492\n     - 2017-09-15: 0.355 to 0.284\n     - 2017-09-16: 0.782 to 0.107\n     - 2017-09-17: 0.746 to -1.528\n     There is no obvious long-term trend over these 4 days.\n\n 13. We will compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days (from 2017-09-18 to 2017-09-21). This is a simple but effective method for short-term daily seasonality.\n\n 14. Steps for the data we have: \n     We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We can group by hour (i.e., all 00:00, all 01:00, ...) and take the mean.\n\n 15. But note: the provided data ends at 2017-09-17 23:00:00. The next 96 hours start at 2017-09-18 00:00:00 and end at 2017-09-21 23:00:00.\n\n 16. We create the forecast:\n     For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days we have.\n\n     Then, for the next 4 days (which are 4*24=96 hours), we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 17. However, we must note that the average might smooth out some patterns. But given the data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have for that hour.\n\n     Example for hour 0 (00:00):\n        2017-09-14 00:00:00: 0.462\n        2017-09-15 00:00:00: 0.355\n        2017-09-16 00:00:00: 0.782\n        2017-09-17 00:00:00: 0.746\n        average = (0.462 + 0.355 + 0.782 + 0.746) / 4 = 2.345 / 4 = 0.58625\n\n     Similarly for hour 1 (01:00):\n        0.320, 0.071, 0.320, 0.391 -> (0.320+0.071+0.320+0.391)/4 = 1.102/4 = 0.2755\n\n     ... and so on.\n\n 19. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days) we will assign:\n        Day 1 (2017-09-18): [avg0, avg1, ... , avg23]\n        Day 2 (2017-09-19): [avg0, avg1, ... , avg23]\n        Day 3 (2017-09-20): [avg0, avg1, ... , avg23]\n        Day 4 (2017-09-21): [avg0, avg1, ... , avg23]\n\n 20. We must generate the dates as well. The next date after 2017-09-17 23:00:00 is 2017-09-18 00:00:00.\n\n 21. We'll create a list of dates starting from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 with a frequency of 1 hour for 96 hours.\n\n 22. We must format the answer exactly as the input: two columns, \"date\" and \"MULL\", without any index.\n\n 23. We note: the original data had 4 decimal places? The numbers are given with 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 24. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and then average.\n\n     We can extract the data by hour:\n\n        hour0: [0.462, 0.355, 0.782, 0.746] -> 0.586\n        hour1: [0.320, 0.071, 0.320, 0.391] -> 0.276\n        ... \n\n 25. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 26. Then we repeat the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 27. We generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = '2017-09-18 00:00:00'\n        end_date = '2017-09-21 23:00:00'\n\n 28. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 29. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we are safe to use the average.\n\n 30. But what if we had missing values? We would have to impute them. Since we are told to be aware of missing values, but the provided data is complete, we proceed.\n\n 31. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n    hour0: [0.462, 0.355, 0.782, 0.746] -> (0.462+0.355+0.782+0.746)/4 = 2.345/4 = 0.58625 -> 0.586\n    hour1: [0.320, 0.071, 0.320, 0.391] -> (0.320+0.071+0.320+0.391)=1.102 -> 1.102/4=0.2755 -> 0.276\n    hour2: [-0.320, -0.711, 0.142, 0.213] -> (-0.320-0.711+0.142+0.213)= -0.676 -> -0.676/4 = -0.169 -> -0.169\n    hour3: [-0.071, 0.426, 0.640, 0.178] -> (-0.071+0.426+0.640+0.178)=1.173 -> 1.173/4=0.29325 -> 0.293\n    hour4: [0.284, -0.817, 1.492, 0.320] -> (0.284-0.817+1.492+0.320)=1.279 -> 1.279/4=0.31975 -> 0.320\n    hour5: [-1.173, -0.497, 0.569, -0.640] -> (-1.173-0.497+0.569-0.640)= -1.741 -> -1.741/4 = -0.43525 -> -0.435\n    hour6: [-0.959, -1.173, -0.640, -1.350] -> (-0.959-1.173-0.640-1.350)= -4.122 -> -4.122/4 = -1.0305 -> -1.031\n    hour7: [-0.249, -0.355, 0.284, -0.178] -> (-0.249-0.355+0.284-0.178)= -0.498 -> -0.498/4 = -0.1245 -> -0.125\n    But wait: the data for hour7 on 2017-09-16 is 0.284? Actually, 2017-09-16 07:00:00 is 0.284? Let me check the data: \n        2017-09-16 07:00:00: 0.284 -> correct.\n\n    hour8: [0.426, -0.178, 0.888, 0.071] -> (0.426-0.178+0.888+0.071)=1.207 -> 1.207/4=0.30175 -> 0.302\n    hour9: [0.355, -0.746, 0.995, 0.249] -> (0.355-0.746+0.995+0.249)=0.853 -> 0.853/4=0.21325 -> 0.213\n    hour10: [1.848, -0.355, 0.924, 2.168] -> (1.848-0.355+0.924+2.168)=4.585 -> 4.585/4=1.14625 -> 1.146\n    hour11: [2.985, -0.924, 3.198, 1.137] -> (2.985-0.924+3.198+1.137)=6.396 -> 6.396/4=1.599 -> 1.599\n    hour12: [2.025, -1.137, 2.772, 1.777] -> (2.025-1.137+2.772+1.777)=5.437 -> 5.437/4=1.35925 -> 1.359\n    hour13: [3.198, 0.320, 2.416, 2.168] -> (3.198+0.320+2.416+2.168)=8.102 -> 8.102/4=2.0255 -> 2.026\n    hour14: [1.812, 0.604, 0.320, 0.213] -> (1.812+0.604+0.320+0.213)=2.949 -> 2.949/4=0.73725 -> 0.737\n    hour15: [0.995, -1.066, 0.533, 0.000] -> (0.995-1.066+0.533+0.000)=0.462 -> 0.462/4=0.1155 -> 0.116\n    hour16: [-1.315, -2.239, -1.315, -0.995] -> (-1.315-2.239-1.315-0.995)= -5.864 -> -5.864/4 = -1.466 -> -1.466\n    hour17: [-2.025, -2.914, -2.416, -2.381] -> (-2.025-2.914-2.416-2.381)= -9.736 -> -9.736/4 = -2.434 -> -2.434\n    hour18: [-3.340, -3.269, -2.416, -3.020] -> (-3.340-3.269-2.416-3.020)= -12.045 -> -12.045/4 = -3.01125 -> -3.011\n    hour19: [-2.772, -3.269, -2.487, -2.239] -> (-2.772-3.269-2.487-2.239)= -10.767 -> -10.767/4 = -2.69175 -> -2.692\n    hour20: [-2.772, -3.127, -2.381, -2.487] -> (-2.772-3.127-2.381-2.487)= -10.767 -> -10.767/4 = -2.69175 -> -2.692\n    But wait: the data for hour20 on 2017-09-15 is -3.127? and 2017-09-16 is -2.381? and 2017-09-17 is -2.487? and 2017-09-14 is -2.772? \n        So: -2.772, -3.127, -2.381, -2.487 -> sum = -10.767 -> average = -2.69175 -> -2.692\n\n    hour21: [-2.381, -3.376, -3.447, -2.772] -> (-2.381-3.376-3.447-2.772)= -11.976 -> -11.976/4 = -2.994 -> -2.994\n    hour22: [-1.279, -1.741, -1.954, -1.883] -> (-1.279-1.741-1.954-1.883)= -6.857 -> -6.857/4 = -1.71425 -> -1.714\n    hour23: [-1.492, 0.284, 0.107, -1.528] -> (-1.492+0.284+0.107-1.528)= -2.629 -> -2.629/4 = -0.65725 -> -0.657\n\n 32. Now, we have 24 values (for hours 0 to 23) that we will repeat 4 times.\n\n 33. The forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-18 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.586\n               2017-09-18 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.276\n               ... until 2017-09-18 23:00:00 -> hour23: -0.657\n\n        Day2: 2017-09-19 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.586\n               ... and so on.\n\n 34. We generate the dates:\n\n        from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00\n\n 35. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 36. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 37. Let's code the output.\n\n 38. We note: the original data had the date as index? But the output should have two columns: \"date\" and \"MULL\".\n\n 39.

We output the answer in the required format.\n\n 44. Since the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content\", we will output all 96 lines.\n\n 45. We note: the method is very simple and might not capture the dynamics, but with limited data and no clear trend, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 46.
