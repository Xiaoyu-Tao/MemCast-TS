        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-18 00:00:00 to 2017-09-21 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, the provided sample for the past 96 is complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we consider:\n    - The data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (24-hour seasonality).\n    - We have 4-day history (96 hours).\n\n 3. Approach:\n    We can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need for 96 forecasts, we might use:\n        - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the past 4 days? \n        - Alternatively, we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note: the data shows some non-stationarity and possible multiple seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we can only capture daily seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n    - Compute the average of each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    - But note: the pattern might change. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-21) as the pattern for the next day? \n\n 6. However, the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n 7. We decide to use a seasonal naive method that uses the last day (2017-09-21) and repeats it for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 copies of 2017-09-21? \n    However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the 4 days. Let's do:\n\n    For hour h (where h from 0 to 23), the forecast for the next day at hour h will be the average of the 4 values at hour h in the past 4 days.\n\n    Then we repeat the same daily pattern for 4 days.\n\n 9. Steps for calculation:\n\n    We have 4 days: day1 (2017-09-18), day2 (2017-09-19), day3 (2017-09-20), day4 (2017-09-21)\n\n    For hour 00:00: \n        values: 1.218, 1.218, 0.914, 0.670 -> average = (1.218+1.218+0.914+0.670)/4 = 4.02/4 = 1.005\n\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n 10. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-22): [avg_00, avg_01, ... avg_23]\n        Day2 (2017-09-23): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-09-24): same\n        Day4 (2017-09-25): same\n\n 11. But note: the data shows a trend? The last day (2017-09-21) has lower values. So we might want to use only the last day? \n     However, the problem does not to have a clear trend. We are only given 4 days. \n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights? But without a clear trend, we stick to simple average.\n\n 13. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n 14. However, note: the data for 2017-09-20 and 2017-09-21 are lower. So the average might be a bit low? \n\n 15. We'll compute:\n\n     hour0: (1.218 + 1.218 + 0.914 + 0.670) / 4 = 1.005\n     hour1: (1.127 + 1.127 + 0.761 + 0.731) / 4 = (1.127+1.127=2.254, 2.254+0.761=3.015, 3.015+0.731=3.746) -> 3.746/4 = 0.9365\n     hour2: (1.127 + 1.279 + 0.883 + 0.731) / 4 = (1.127+1.279=2.406, 2.406+0.883=3.289, 3.289+0.731=4.02) -> 4.02/4=1.005\n     hour3: (1.097+1.462+0.914+0.701)/4 = (1.097+1.462=2.559, 2.559+0.914=3.473, 3.473+0.701=4.174) -> 4.174/4=1.0435\n     hour4: (1.310+1.310+1.005+1.157)/4 = (1.310+1.310=2.62, 2.62+1.005=3.625, 3.625+1.157=4.782) -> 4.782/4=1.1955\n     hour5: (1.279+1.249+1.036+1.036)/4 = (1.279+1.249=2.528, 2.528+1.036=3.564, 3.564+1.036=4.6) -> 4.6/4=1.15\n     hour6: (1.218+1.371+0.883+1.066)/4 = (1.218+1.371=2.589, 2.589+0.883=3.472, 3.472+1.066=4.538) -> 4.538/4=1.1345\n     hour7: (1.249+1.218+0.975+1.005)/4 = (1.249+1.218=2.467, 2.467+0.975=3.442, 3.442+1.005=4.447) -> 4.447/4=1.11175\n     hour8: (1.401+1.432+1.218+1.218)/4 = (1.401+1.432=2.833, 2.833+1.218=4.051, 4.051+1.218=5.269) -> 5.269/4=1.31725\n     hour9: (1.127+1.340+1.310+1.340)/4 = (1.127+1.340=2.467, 2.467+1.310=3.777, 3.777+1.340=5.117) -> 5.117/4=1.27925\n     hour10: (1.097+1.340+1.310+1.279)/4 = (1.097+1.340=2.437, 2.437+1.310=3.747, 3.747+1.279=5.026) -> 5.026/4=1.2565\n     hour11: (1.066+1.401+1.249+1.127)/4 = (1.066+1.401=2.467, 2.467+1.249=3.716, 3.716+1.127=4.843) -> 4.843/4=1.21075\n     hour12: (1.005+1.340+1.492+1.097)/4 = (1.005+1.340=2.345, 2.345+1.492=3.837, 3.837+1.097=4.934) -> 4.934/4=1.2335\n     hour13: (1.036+1.157+1.005+1.066)/4 = (1.036+1.157=2.193, 2.193+1.005=3.198, 3.198+1.066=4.264) -> 4.264/4=1.066\n     hour14: (1.005+1.066+1.097+1.127)/4 = (1.005+1.066=2.071, 2.071+1.097=3.168, 3.168+1.127=4.295) -> 4.295/4=1.07375\n     hour15: (1.249+0.975+1.066+0.975)/4 = (1.249+0.975=2.224, 2.224+1.066=3.29, 3.29+0.975=4.265) -> 4.265/4=1.06625\n     hour16: (1.066+1.127+1.188+1.157)/4 = (1.066+1.127=2.193, 2.193+1.188=3.381, 3.381+1.157=4.538) -> 4.538/4=1.1345\n     hour17: (1.005+1.097+1.005+0.822)/4 = (1.005+1.097=2.102, 2.102+1.005=3.107, 3.107+0.822=3.929) -> 3.929/4=0.98225\n     hour18: (1.066+1.127+1.127+0.701)/4 = (1.066+1.127=2.193, 2.193+1.127=3.32, 3.32+0.701=4.021) -> 4.021/4=1.00525\n     hour19: (1.157+1.066+0.792+0.731)/4 = (1.157+1.066=2.223, 2.223+0.792=3.015, 3.015+0.731=3.746) -> 3.746/4=0.9365\n     hour20: (1.218+1.310+0.853+0.761)/4 = (1.218+1.310=2.528, 2.528+0.853=3.381, 3.381+0.761=4.142) -> 4.142/4=1.0355\n     hour21: (1.371+1.249+0.822+0.670)/4 = (1.371+1.249=2.62, 2.62+0.822=3.442, 3.442+0.670=4.112) -> 4.112/4=1.028\n     hour22: (1.310+1.127+0.761+0.670)/4 = (1.310+1.127=2.437, 2.437+0.761=3.198, 3.198+0.670=3.868) -> 3.868/4=0.967\n     hour23: (1.157+1.066+0.670+0.731)/4 = (1.157+1.066=2.223, 2.223+0.670=2.893, 2.893+0.731=3.624) -> 3.624/4=0.906\n\n 16. Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the above 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 17. The starting time is 2017-09-22 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-09-21 23:00:00).\n\n 18. We generate:\n\n        date: from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-22 23:00:00 -> [1.005, 0.9365, 1.005, 0.906] for the first day? \n        But note: the last hour of the day (23:00) is 0.906.\n\n 19. We'll generate the numbers and round to 3 decimal places? The original data has 3 decimals.\n\n 20. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: 1.005\n        hour1: 0.9365 -> 0.937 (rounded to 3 decimals:  But note: 0.9365 rounded to 3 decimals is 0.937? \n        Actually, 0.9365: \n            The fourth decimal is 5 -> round up: 0.937\n\n        Similarly:\n\n        hour0: 1.005 -> 1.005\n        hour1: 0.9365 -> 0.937\n        hour2: 1.005 -> 1.005\n        hour3: 1.0435 -> 1.044\n        hour4: 1.1955 -> 1.196\n        hour5: 1.15 -> 1.150\n        hour6: 1.1345 -> 1.135\n        hour7: 1.11175 -> 1.112\n        hour8: 1.31725 -> 1.317\n        hour9: 1.27925 -> 1.279\n        hour10: 1.2565 -> 1.257\n        hour11: 1.21075 -> 1.211\n        hour12: 1.2335 -> 1.234\n        hour13: 1.066 -> 1.066\n        hour14: 1.07375 -> 1.074\n        hour15: 1.06625 -> 1.066\n        hour16: 1.1345 -> 1.135\n        hour17: 0.98225 -> 0.982\n        hour18: 1.00525 -> 1.005\n        hour19: 0.9365 -> 0.937\n        hour20: 1.0355 -> 1.036\n        hour21: 1.028 -> 1.028\n        hour22: 0.967 -> 0.967\n        hour23: 0.906 -> 0.906\n\n 21. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-22 00:00:00 -> 1.005\n               2017-09-22 01:00:00 -> 0.937\n               2017-09-22 02:00:00 -> 1.005\n               2017-09-22 03:00:00 -> 1.044\n               2017-09-22 04:00:00 -> 1.196\n               2017-09-22 05:00:00 -> 1.150\n               2017-09-22 06:00:00 -> 1.135\n               2017-09-22 07:00:00 -> 1.112\n               2017-09-22 08:00:00 -> 1.317\n               2017-09-22 09:00:00 -> 1.279\n               2017-09-22 10:00:00 -> 1.257\n               2017-09-22 11:00:00 -> 1.211\n               2017-09-22 12:00:00 -> 1.234\n               2017-09-22 13:00:00 -> 1.066\n               2017-09-22 14:00:00 -> 1.074\n               2017-09-22 15:00:00 -> 1.066\n               2017-09-22 16:00:00 -> 1.135\n               2017-09-22 17:00:00 -> 0.982\n               2017-09-22 18:00:00 -> 1.005\n               2017-09-22 19:00:00 -> 0.937\n               2017-09-22 20:00:00 -> 1.036\n               2017-09-22 21:00:00 -> 1.028\n               2017-09-22 22:00:00 -> 0.967\n               2017-09-22 23:00:00 -> 0.906\n\n        Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 22. We generate 4 days: 2017-09-22, 2017-09-23, 2017-09-24, 2017-09-25.\n\n 23. We must output 96 rows.\n\n 24. Format: \n        <answer>\n        date and time in the same format, and the LULL value (rounded to 3 decimals as above).\n\n 25. We note: the dates must be consecutive and hourly.\n\n 26. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2017-09-22 00:00:00 1.005\n        2017-09-22 01:00:00 0.937\n        ... until 2017-09-25 23:00:00\n\n 27. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-22 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-09-25 23:00:00\n\n 28. We have 4*24=96 records.\n\n 29. We'll create a list of the 24 average values (rounded) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n 30. The list of the 24 values (in order from hour0 to hour23) is:\n\n        [1.005, 0.937, 1.005, 1.044, 1.196, 1.150, 1.135, 1.112, 1.317, 1.279, 1.257, 1.211, 1.234, 1.066, 1.074, 1.066, 1.135, 0.982, 1.005, 0.937, 1.036, 1.028, 0.967, 0.906]\n\n 31. Then we write:\n\n        for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour_index in range(24):\n                date = start_date + day_offset days and hour_index hours.\n\n        Start date: 2017-09-22 00:00:00\n\n 32. We output:\n\n        We must output in the same format: \n            \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and then the value.\n\n 33. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017, 9, 22)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                current_date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # format: \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n\n 34. But we are writing the code? No, we are writing the output.\n\n 35. We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n 36. Let's do:\n\n        Day0: 2017-09-22\n        Day1: 2017-09-23\n        Day2: 2017-09-24\n        Day3: 2017-09-25\n\n 37. We write the data.\n\n 38. Note: We are not using any model that accounts for potential missing values in the past because the given 96 are complete. And for the future, we are just repeating the average pattern.\n\n 39.
