        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates is complete.\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 time steps and the data shows daily seasonality (with patterns repeating every 24 hours),\n we can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete answer without the ability to run code,\n we can use a simple method such as seasonal naive forecasting or exponential smoothing. However, the data also shows some non-stationarity and trends.\n\n But note: the data has a clear daily pattern (lower at night, higher during the day) but also some non-repeating variations.\n\n Given the constraints of this environment, we will use a simple seasonal model. However, we must be cautious because the last day (2017-02-21) shows a drop in temperature.\n\n Since we are to provide the next 96 points (which is 4 days) and we have 4 days of history, we can consider a seasonal naive approach for each hour.\n\n However, the data does not show a strong consistency in the 4 days. Let's break down:\n\n Option: We can use the last day (2017-02-21) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But the pattern might be evolving.\n\n Given the complexity and without running a full model, we can do:\n\n  - Calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have.\n  - Then use that average for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n However, note that the last day (2017-02-21) is significantly colder. So if we average, we might smooth out the recent drop.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (2017-02-21) and then adjust by the average daily pattern? But we are to forecast 4 days.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the time of year and we are going forward only 4 days, we can assume that the pattern (the daily cycle) remains but the level might change.\n\n We can do:\n  1. Compute the daily average for each of the 4 days.\n  2. Observe the trend in the daily averages? \n        Day1 (2017-02-18): average = (6.964+7.457+...+9.286)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            We see values: min ~6.6, max ~13.2 -> average around 9-10?\n        Day2: 2017-02-19: min ~9, max ~14.8 -> average around 11-12?\n        Day3: 2017-02-20: min ~3.6, max ~15 -> average around 8?\n        Day4: 2017-02-21: min ~1, max ~6 -> average around 3-4?\n\n  The daily averages: \n      Day1: let's calculate: \n          sum = 6.964+7.457+6.894+7.105+6.683+6.753+6.613+7.035+6.753+6.824+7.597+8.582+9.919+9.778+13.014+13.225+11.748+11.326+11.326+10.622+9.426+9.215+9.778+9.286\n          = 222.738 -> average = 222.738/24 = 9.28075\n      Day2: \n          sum = 9.004+9.426+8.864+9.145+9.215+9.215+9.849+10.552+11.678+11.537+12.381+12.944+12.592+12.944+13.014+11.889+11.678+11.678+11.396+13.647+14.843+14.351+14.210+14.351\n          = 270.339 -> average = 11.264125\n      Day3:\n          sum = 14.280+14.140+14.280+14.491+14.703+15.054+13.085+11.185+9.426+7.246+6.402+6.120+5.276+6.261+5.698+6.050+4.995+4.713+5.206+4.221+4.573+3.939+4.150+3.658\n          = 180.111 -> average = 7.504625\n      Day4:\n          sum = 3.166+2.744+2.110+1.899+2.040+2.040+2.040+1.548+1.055+1.759+2.532+3.095+3.517+4.502+4.924+5.206+4.995+4.854+6.050+5.768+3.306+2.040+1.477+1.829\n          = 72.001 -> average = 3.0000416667\n\n  The daily averages are: [9.28075, 11.264125, 7.504625, 3.0000416667]\n\n  There is a clear downward trend in the last two days. We might extrapolate the level for the next 4 days? \n  But 4 days is short and the drop is sharp. We could use a linear trend for the daily levels? \n\n  However, note that the last day (day4) is very cold. It might be an anomaly or the start of a cold period.\n\n  Without more context, we can try to model the daily level with a simple method. Let's fit a line to the last two days? \n  But two points are not enough. Alternatively, we can use the last day's level and assume it remains? \n\n  But the problem says we must forecast 96 points (4 days). We can do:\n\n    For each hour h (0-23) in the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8), we set:\n        OT_{day5, h} = OT_{day4, h}   [if we think the last day is the most relevant] \n        but that would be a flat forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n  However, the data shows a clear drop. We might use the last day as the base and then adjust by the average daily pattern relative to the daily mean? \n\n  Let me try:\n\n    Step 1: For each day, compute the daily mean (as above).\n    Step 2: For each hour in a day, compute the deviation from the daily mean for that day.\n    Step 2: Then average the deviations for the same hour across the 4 days -> this gives an average daily pattern.\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, we need to set a daily level (the mean for that day). How to forecast the daily mean for the next 4 days?\n\n    We can use a simple exponential smoothing or linear regression on the daily means? \n\n    The daily means: \n        Day1: 9.28\n        Day2: 11.26\n        Day3: 7.50\n        Day4: 3.00\n\n    We see a peak on day2 and then a drop. We can try to fit a linear trend to the last two days? \n        Day3: 7.50, Day4: 3.00 -> slope = (3.00 - 7.50)/1 = -4.5 per day.\n\n    Then for the next 4 days:\n        Day5: 3.00 - 1 * 4.5 = -1.5? -> that doesn't make sense (negative temperature? but the data has been as low as 1.055)\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days for the next days? \n\n    Given the volatility, a conservative approach is to use the last day's pattern and then a slight adjustment.\n\n    Since we are not allowed to output negative, we must avoid negative forecasts.\n\n    Another idea: use the last day (day4) as the base and then for the next day, use the same as day4, but then the next day a little higher? \n\n    However, the problem does not to omit any content and we must provide 96 points.\n\n  Considering the above, I propose:\n\n    We use the average daily pattern (the deviations) and then set the daily level to the last day's level (3.00) for the next 4 days? \n    But that would be constant. Alternatively, we can assume the level remains at 3.00 for the next 4 days? \n\n    But the data on day4 is the coldest and it might be an anomaly. Without more context, we can use the average of the last two days for the level? \n    (7.50 + 3.00)/2 = 5.25, then use that for the next 4 days? \n\n    However, the pattern of day4 is very different: it started at 3.166 at 00:00 and then went up to 6.050 at 19:00 and then dropped.\n\n  After careful thought, I think the safest is to use the last day (day4) as the pattern for the next 4 days. That is, we repeat the day4 pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n  Why?\n    - The data shows a sudden drop and we don't have information to predict a recovery.\n    - The problem says we must provide the next 96 points, and repeating the last day's pattern for 4 days is a common naive approach for short-term forecasting when there is a strong daily pattern and recent anomaly.\n\n  So:\n    We will take the 24 hours of day4 (2017-02-21) and repeat them 4 times.\n\n  But note: the dates must be continuous. The last given date is 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n  The next 96 hours (4 days) will be from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n  We will set:\n      2017-02-22 00:00:00: same as 2017-02-21 00:00:00 -> 3.166\n      2017-02-22 01:00:00: same as 2017-02-21 01:00:00 -> 2.744\n      ... until 2017-02-22 23:00:00: same as 2017-02-21 23:00:00 -> 1.829\n\n      then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n  However, this might be too simplistic and does not account for any recovery. But without more data, it is a safe bet.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n  Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 00: (6.964, 9.004, 14.280, 3.166) -> average = (6.964+9.004+14.280+3.166)/4 = 8.3535\n    Hour 01: (7.457, 9.426, 14.140, 2.744) -> (7.457+9.426+14.140+2.744)/4 = 8.44175\n    ... \n\n  But note: the last day is very cold, so the average might be higher than the last day but lower than the first two days.\n\n  However, if we use the average, we are ignoring the recent drop. \n\n  Another idea: use the median? \n\n  Given the time, and since the problem requires a complete answer, I will choose the method of repeating the last day's pattern for 4 days.\n\n  Why?\n    - It is simple and captures the most recent pattern.\n    - The data shows a sudden drop and we don't know if it will recover or not. Repeating the last day is a conservative approach.\n\n  Steps for repeating:\n\n    We have 24 values for 2017-02-21 (from 00:00 to 23:00). We will repeat these 24 values 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n  The values for 2017-02-21:\n    00:00: 3.166\n    01:00: 2.744\n    02:00: 2.110\n    03:00: 1.899\n    04:00: 2.040\n    05:00: 2.040\n    06:00: 2.040\n    07:00: 1.548\n    08:00: 1.055\n    09:00: 1.759\n    10:00: 2.532\n    11:00: 3.095\n    12:00: 3.517\n    13:00: 4.502\n    14:00: 4.924\n    15:00: 5.206\n    16:00: 4.995\n    17:00: 4.854\n    18:00: 6.050\n    19:00: 5.768\n    20:00: 3.306\n    21:00: 2.040\n    22:00: 1.477\n    23:00: 1.829\n\n  We will use these 24 numbers for the next 4 days.\n\n  The dates:\n\n    Day1: 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-22 23:00:00 -> values: [3.166, 2.744, ... , 1.829]\n    Day2: 2017-02-23 00:00:00 to 2017-02-23 23:00:00 -> same 24 values\n    Day3: 2017-02-24 00:00:00 to 2017-02-24 23:00:00 -> same\n    Day4: 2017-02-25 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00 -> same\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data. We are providing 96 values.\n\n  However, we must generate the dates. The last given date is 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n  The next date is 2017-02-22 00:00:00, then 2017-02-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-25 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n  Format: \n        date (as string in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS') and the OT value (with 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n  The input had 3 decimal places, so we'll keep the same.\n\n  We'll write 96 lines.\n\n  Let's do:\n\n      date: starting from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00, hourly.\n\n  Code for generating the dates:\n\n      base_date = '2017-02-22'\n      for day in range(4): # 4 days\n          for hour in range(24):\n              date_str = f\"2017-02-{22+day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n              # but note: 22+0 -> 22, 22+1->23, 22+2->24, 22+3->25\n\n  However, we must be cautious: February 2017 had 28 days? \n      February 2017: 2017 is not a leap year (2016 was). So February 2017 has 28 days.\n\n  So:\n      2017-02-22, 23, 24, 25 are all in February.\n\n  We'll generate:\n\n      2017-02-22 00:00:00\n      2017-02-22 01:00:00\n      ...\n      2017-02-22 23:00:00\n      2017-02-23 00:00:00\n      ...\n      2017-02-25 23:00:00\n\n  And the OT values: we have a list of 24 values (from 2017-02-21) that we repeat 4 times.\n\n  Let the list be:\n      base_OT = [3.166, 2.744, 2.110, 1.899, 2.040, 2.040, 2.040, 1.548, 1.055, 1.759, 2.532, 3.095, \n                 3.517, 4.502, 4.924, 5.206, 4.995, 4.854, 6.050, 5.768, 3.306, 2.040, 1.477, 1.829]\n\n  Then for the next 96 hours, we do:\n      OT = base_OT * 4   (which is 96 values)\n\n  But note: the input had 3 decimal places, so we output the same.\n\n  However, we must note that the last day (2017-02-21) might be an anomaly and this forecast might be low. \n  But without more information, we stick to this.\n\n  We output in the required format.\n\n  Let's write the answer.\n",
