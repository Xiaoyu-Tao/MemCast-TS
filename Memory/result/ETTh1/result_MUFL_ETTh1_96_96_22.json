        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). There are 4 days of data (96 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method that can handle seasonality. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, but we have 4 days and we are forecasting 4 days? \n      However, we note that the pattern might change from day to day. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) might be suitable, but we have only 4 days (one season) so it might not be enough to fit multiple seasons.\n\n 4. Given the very limited data, a simple approach is to use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days? \n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) and we have 4 days of history. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days? \n    However, that would be a constant pattern for each day. Alternatively, we can use the last day (the 4th day) as the forecast for the next day? But we are to forecast 4 days.\n\n 5. Another idea: use a moving window or a simple exponential smoothing. But with only 4 days, we can try to use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days for each of the next 4 days? That would be:\n\n    Let H_i (for i=0 to 23) be the average of the i-th hour of the day over the 4 days we have.\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (from 2016-10-01 to 2016-10-04), the forecast for each hour i in each day would be H_i.\n\n    However, this method ignores any trend and recent changes. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture trend.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-09-30) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? But again, we have only 4 days.\n\n 7. Considering the above, and the fact that we are required to provide 96 points, we decide to use the average by hour of the day over the 4 available days.\n\n    Steps for this method:\n      - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days, we will use these 24 means and repeat them 4 times.\n\n 8. However, note that the data shows some variation and the last day (2016-09-30) might be the most recent pattern. But without more data, we stick to the overall average per hour.\n\n 9. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00): \n        Day1: 11.371, Day2: 13.219, Day3: 9.097, Day4: 7.071 -> average = (11.371+13.219+9.097+7.071)/4 = 40.758/4 = 10.1895\n\n    Similarly for hour 1 (01:00): \n        Day1: 10.163, Day2: 12.899, Day3: 8.209, Day4: 7.036 -> average = (10.163+12.899+8.209+7.036)/4 = 38.307/4 = 9.57675\n\n    And so on.\n\n 10. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n        Day 5 (2016-10-01): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... , avg_hour23]\n        Day 6 (2016-10-02): same 24 values\n        Day 7 (2016-10-03): same 24 values\n        Day 8 (2016-10-04): same 24 values\n\n 11. But note: the data ends at 2016-09-30 23:00:00, so the next day is 2016-10-01.\n\n 12. We must generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 13. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? Let's look at the last day (2016-09-30) and the first day (2016-09-27). \n     The values on 2016-09-30 are generally lower than the first day. So using the overall average might be higher than the recent pattern.\n\n 14. Alternative: use only the last two days? or the last day? But the requirement is to forecast 4 days and we have 4 days. \n\n 15. Considering the trade-off, we choose to use the average of the last two days (2016-09-29 and 2016-09-30) for each hour? \n     That would be 2 days of data per hour. This might capture the recent pattern better.\n\n 16. Let me compare:\n\n     Option 1: Use all 4 days -> might be too high for the recent trend?\n     Option 2: Use the last 2 days.\n\n 17. We can also consider: the problem says there are missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we don't need to impute for the historical data.\n\n 18. We decide to use the average of the last two days (which are 48 hours) for each hour of the day. Why? Because the last two days are more recent and might be more representative.\n\n     For hour0: Day3: 9.097, Day4: 7.071 -> average = (9.097+7.071)/2 = 8.084\n     For hour1: Day3: 8.209, Day4: 7.036 -> average = (8.209+7.036)/2 = 7.6225\n\n 19. Then we repeat this pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. But note: we are forecasting 4 days, and we are using 2 days to form the pattern. This might be acceptable.\n\n 21. However, let's see the pattern of the data: the load seems to have a daily cycle. The last two days (2016-09-29 and 2016-09-30) are both lower than the first two days. \n     So using the last two days might be more conservative and reflect a possible downward trend? But we don't have enough data to confirm a trend.\n\n 22. Given the ambiguity, and the requirement to provide a forecast, we choose the last two days average.\n\n 23. Steps:\n\n     - Extract the last 48 hours (two days: 2016-09-29 and 2016-09-30) and group by hour (0-23).\n     - Compute the mean for each hour across these two days.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean for the corresponding hour.\n\n 24. We must generate the dates: \n        Start: 2016-10-01 00:00:00, then hourly until 2016-10-04 23:00:00.\n\n 25. How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (2016-09-29 00:00:00: 9.097, 2016-09-30 00:00:00: 7.071) -> 8.084\n        Hour 1: (2016-09-29 01:00:00: 8.209, 2016-09-30 01:00:00: 7.036) -> 7.6225\n        ... and so on.\n\n 26. We'll compute the 24 hourly averages.\n\n 27. Then, the forecast for:\n        2016-10-01 00:00:00 -> 8.084\n        2016-10-01 01:00:00 -> 7.6225\n        ... \n        2016-10-01 23:00:00 -> average of 2016-09-29 23:00:00 (5.082) and 2016-09-30 23:00:00 (5.330) -> (5.082+5.330)/2 = 5.206\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 numbers for 2016-10-02, 2016-10-03, 2016-10-04.\n\n 28. We must format the answer exactly as the input: two columns, with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the MUFL value as a float with three decimal places.\n\n 29. However, note that the input data has some values with three decimal places and some with less, but we will output three decimal places.\n\n 30. Let's compute the 24 hourly means from the last two days (2016-09-29 and 2016-09-30):\n\n        Hour0: (9.097 + 7.071) / 2 = 8.084\n        Hour1: (8.209 + 7.036) / 2 = 7.6225 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 7.623\n        Hour2: (7.995 + 5.508) / 2 = 6.7515 -> 6.752\n        Hour3: (8.315 + 5.863) / 2 = 7.089 -> 7.089\n        Hour4: (8.173 + 6.716) / 2 = 7.4445 -> 7.445\n        Hour5: (4.300 + 5.686) / 2 = 4.993 -> 4.993\n        Hour6: (4.087 + 6.965) / 2 = 5.526 -> 5.526\n        Hour7: (5.295 + 4.762) / 2 = 5.0285 -> 5.029\n        Hour8: (4.477 + 4.655) / 2 = 4.566 -> 4.566\n        Hour9: (2.203 + 4.406) / 2 = 3.3045 -> 3.305\n        Hour10: (2.168 + 4.797) / 2 = 3.4825 -> 3.483\n        Hour11: (2.843 + 4.904) / 2 = 3.8735 -> 3.874\n        Hour12: (2.665 + 4.513) / 2 = 3.589 -> 3.589\n        Hour13: (3.305 + 4.868) / 2 = 4.0865 -> 4.087\n        Hour14: (2.878 + 4.513) / 2 = 3.6955 -> 3.696\n        Hour15: (3.411 + 4.939) / 2 = 4.175 -> 4.175\n        Hour16: (3.838 + 4.939) / 2 = 4.3885 -> 4.389\n        Hour17: (4.584 + 5.508) / 2 = 5.046 -> 5.046\n        Hour18: (4.158 + 4.620) / 2 = 4.389 -> 4.389\n        Hour19: (3.198 + 4.477) / 2 = 3.8375 -> 3.838\n        Hour20: (2.701 + 3.944) / 2 = 3.3225 -> 3.323\n        Hour21: (2.949 + 3.553) / 2 = 3.251 -> 3.251\n        Hour22: (3.482 + 5.224) / 2 = 4.353 -> 4.353\n        Hour23: (5.082 + 5.330) / 2 = 5.206\n\n 31. Now, we will create 4 days of data (from 2016-10-01 to 2016-10-04) using these 24 values in order, repeated for each day.\n\n 32. We generate the timestamps:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-01 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2016-10-02 00:00:00 to 2016-10-02 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2016-10-03 00:00:00 to 2016-10-03 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2016-10-04 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00\n\n 33. We write the data in the same format.\n\n 34. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 35. Let's code the output.\n\n 36. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are not given any missing values in the history, so we don't need to impute for the history. For the forecast, we are generating a complete set.\n\n 37. We output the forecasted values as described.\n\n 38. We must follow the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-01 00:00:00 8.084\n2016-10-01 01:00:00 7.623\n... \n2016-10-04 23:00:00 5.206\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 39. But note: the example input has the MUFL value aligned to three decimal places. We rounded our computed averages to three decimal places.\n\n 40. We'll generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 41. The list of averages for 24 hours (from hour0 to hour23) is:\n\n        [8.084, 7.623, 6.752, 7.089, 7.445, 4.993, 5.526, 5.029, 4.566, 3.305, 3.483, 3.874, 3.589, 4.087, 3.696, 4.175, 4.389, 5.046, 4.389, 3.838, 3.323, 3.251, 4.353, 5.206]\n\n 42. Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n 43. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-01 00:00:00\n        Then add one hour until we have 96 records.\n\n 44. We note that the last date in the input is 2016-09-30 23:00:00, so the next hour is 2016-10-01 00:00:00.\n\n 45. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 46. Let's write the output.\n",
