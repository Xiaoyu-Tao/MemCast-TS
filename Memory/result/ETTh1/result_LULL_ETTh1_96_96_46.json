        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the \"Low UseLess Load\" (LULL) of a transformer.\n The data starts at 2017-01-01 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-01-04 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and shows a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method that can capture seasonality. Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and need to forecast 96 points, \n    we can use a simple seasonal model or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data has a clear daily cycle (24 hours). We can use a seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day. \n Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour.\n\n Approach:\n We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps in detail:\n - Group the data by the hour of the day (i.e., 0,1,...,23).\n - For each hour, compute the average of the LULL values at that hour across the 4 days.\n - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n Why this approach?\n - It's simple and leverages the daily seasonality.\n - With only 4 days, we don't have a long history, so taking an average per hour is reasonable.\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall pattern:\n\n Day 1: \n   00:00: 1.432, 01:00: 1.218, ... 23:00: 0.518\n Day 2:\n   00:00: 0.487, ... 23:00: 0.640\n Day 3:\n   00:00: 0.579, ... 23:00: 0.701\n Day 4:\n   00:00: 0.761, ... 23:00: 0.731\n\n We see that the values at the same hour are not exactly the same, but we are going to average them.\n\n Example for hour 0:\n   Day1: 1.432, Day2: 0.487, Day3: 0.579, Day4: 0.761\n   Average = (1.432 + 0.487 + 0.579 + 0.761) / 4 = 3.259 / 4 = 0.81475\n\n We do this for each hour.\n\n But note: the data might have a slight increasing trend? However, with only 4 days, it's hard to tell. \n We'll stick with the average per hour.\n\n Implementation:\n\n 1. Create a list of the 96 data points.\n 2. Reshape the data into a 4x24 matrix (4 days, 24 hours per day).\n 3. For each hour (column), compute the mean.\n 4. The forecast for the next 4 days will be the same 24-hour pattern (the computed means) repeated for 4 days.\n\n However, note: the provided data ends at 2017-01-04 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n   Day 5: 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-05 23:00:00\n   Day 6: 2017-01-06 00:00:00 to 2017-01-06 23:00:00\n   Day 7: 2017-01-07 00:00:00 to 2017-01-07 23:00:00\n   Day 8: 2017-01-08 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00\n\n We will generate the dates accordingly.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n Hour 0: (1.432 + 0.487 + 0.579 + 0.761) / 4 = 0.81475\n Hour 1: (1.218 + 0.640 + 0.579 + 0.640) / 4 = (1.218+0.640+0.579+0.640)=3.077/4=0.76925\n Hour 2: (1.097 + 0.609 + 0.670 + 0.701) / 4 = (1.097+0.609+0.670+0.701)=3.077/4=0.76925\n Hour 3: (1.249 + 0.579 + 0.640 + 0.518) / 4 = (1.249+0.579+0.640+0.518)=2.986/4=0.7465\n Hour 4: (1.401 + 1.005 + 0.670 + 0.518) / 4 = (1.401+1.005+0.670+0.518)=3.594/4=0.8985\n Hour 5: (1.371 + 0.701 + 0.609 + 0.518) / 4 = (1.371+0.701+0.609+0.518)=3.199/4=0.79975\n Hour 6: (1.401 + 0.670 + 0.579 + 0.670) / 4 = (1.401+0.670+0.579+0.670)=3.32/4=0.83\n Hour 7: (1.249 + 0.761 + 0.609 + 0.853) / 4 = (1.249+0.761+0.609+0.853)=3.472/4=0.868\n Hour 8: (1.036 + 1.127 + 0.761 + 0.975) / 4 = (1.036+1.127+0.761+0.975)=3.899/4=0.97475\n Hour 9: (1.401 + 1.127 + 1.066 + 0.914) / 4 = (1.401+1.127+1.066+0.914)=4.508/4=1.127\n Hour 10: (1.523 + 0.944 + 1.036 + 1.279) / 4 = (1.523+0.944+1.036+1.279)=4.782/4=1.1955\n Hour 11: (1.462 + 0.853 + 1.036 + 0.944) / 4 = (1.462+0.853+1.036+0.944)=4.295/4=1.07375\n Hour 12: (1.371 + 0.761 + 0.670 + 0.701) / 4 = (1.371+0.761+0.670+0.701)=3.503/4=0.87575\n Hour 13: (1.340 + 0.761 + 0.883 + 0.822) / 4 = (1.340+0.761+0.883+0.822)=3.806/4=0.9515\n Hour 14: (1.340 + 1.097 + 1.097 + 0.975) / 4 = (1.340+1.097+1.097+0.975)=4.509/4=1.12725\n Hour 15: (1.218 + 0.914 + 1.036 + 0.853) / 4 = (1.218+0.914+1.036+0.853)=4.021/4=1.00525\n Hour 16: (1.036 + 0.853 + 0.914 + 0.975) / 4 = (1.036+0.853+0.914+0.975)=3.778/4=0.9445\n Hour 17: (0.914 + 0.853 + 0.761 + 0.701) / 4 = (0.914+0.853+0.761+0.701)=3.229/4=0.80725\n Hour 18: (0.761 + 0.761 + 0.761 + 0.822) / 4 = (0.761+0.761+0.761+0.822)=3.105/4=0.77625\n Hour 19: (0.914 + 0.609 + 0.761 + 0.883) / 4 = (0.914+0.609+0.761+0.883)=3.167/4=0.79175\n Hour 20: (0.792 + 0.609 + 0.701 + 0.822) / 4 = (0.792+0.609+0.701+0.822)=2.924/4=0.731\n Hour 21: (0.640 + 0.609 + 0.640 + 0.731) / 4 = (0.640+0.609+0.640+0.731)=2.62/4=0.655\n Hour 22: (0.518 + 0.518 + 0.640 + 0.731) / 4 = (0.518+0.518+0.640+0.731)=2.407/4=0.60175\n Hour 23: (0.518 + 0.640 + 0.701 + 0.731) / 4 = (0.518+0.640+0.701+0.731)=2.59/4=0.6475\n\n Now, we will create the next 96 points by repeating these 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n The forecast for:\n   2017-01-05 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.81475\n   2017-01-05 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.76925\n   ... and so on.\n\n We must format the dates correctly and output the data.\n\n However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places.
