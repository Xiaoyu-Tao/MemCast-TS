        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n We note that the data has 24*4 = 96 records (4 days of hourly data).\n\n The task is to forecast the next 96 recorded dates (i.e., the next 4 days, from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 records we don't see any missing. \n But we are to be cautious.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we are dealing with a time series that has:\n   - Hourly frequency\n   - Only 96 points (4 days) of history.\n\n We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same format.\n\n Approach:\n   We can use a simple time series forecasting method that can handle multiple steps ahead. Given the limited history, \n   we might consider:\n     - Seasonal Naive: if we see a daily pattern, we can use the value from the same hour of the previous day.\n     - However, we have 4 days of data, so we can average the same hour over the past 4 days? But note: the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model or a simple AR model. But with only 96 points, and we need 96 steps ahead, \n   we must be cautious.\n\n   Observing the data: \n     The data shows a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, on each day, the load is higher during the day and lower at night? \n     But let's look:\n\n        Day 1 (09-11): \n          Starts at 17.348 (00:00) and then goes down to 10.918 at 09:00, then down to 5.626 at 21:00 and then up to 8.707 at 23:00.\n\n        Day 2 (09-12): \n          Starts at 9.31 (00:00) and then goes up to 10.65 at 06:00, then down to 6.966 at 08:00, then up to 8.306 at 10:00, then down to 6.296 at 14:00, then up to 8.105 at 17:00, then down to 6.966 at 20:00 and then up to 10.784 at 23:00.\n\n        Day 3 (09-13): \n          Starts at 14.602 (00:00) and then stays around 14.5 until 06:00 (16.142), then drops to 10.65 at 08:00, then down to 6.899 at 09:00, then fluctuates and ends at 11.989 at 23:00.\n\n        Day 4 (09-14): \n          Starts at 12.525 (00:00) and then goes down to 9.444 at 03:00, then up to 11.454 at 06:00, then down to 8.908 at 09:00, then up to 10.047 at 10:00, then down to 5.492 at 21:00 and then up to 9.779 at 23:00.\n\n     The pattern is not very clear, but we can see that the load is higher at the beginning (00:00) and then drops during the day and then rises again at night? \n     However, the values are not exactly repeating.\n\n   Given the complexity and the requirement to forecast 96 steps, we can use a simple method:\n\n     Method: We will use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n     For example, for the hour 00:00, we have:\n        Day1: 17.348\n        Day2: 9.310\n        Day3: 14.602\n        Day4: 12.525\n\n        Average = (17.348 + 9.310 + 14.602 + 12.525) / 4 = 13.44625\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, each 00:00 will be 13.44625? But that would be the same for every day. Alternatively, we can use the last available same hour (i.e., seasonal naive with seasonality=24) but using the last day? \n\n     However, note: we are forecasting 4 days. We can do:\n\n        Day5 (2016-09-15 00:00:00: use the average of the 4 previous 00:00\n        Day5 01:00:00: average of the 4 previous 01:00:00\n\n        and so on.\n\n     But we have only 4 days, so we can compute 24 averages (for each hour of the day) and then use that for each day in the forecast.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Group the data by hour (i.e., 0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n        Step 2: For the next 4 days (96 hours), assign the mean of the corresponding hour.\n\n     However, note: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture. Also, we are not given any other variables.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the pattern for the next day? But the problem says the data has missing values? We don't see any in the provided data, but we are to be cautious.\n\n     Since the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 we don't, we can proceed with the average method.\n\n     But note: the average might smooth out the pattern. Another idea: use the median? But we have only 4 points per hour.\n\n     We'll use the mean for each hour.\n\n     How to compute:\n\n        For hour 0: (17.348 + 9.310 + 14.602 + 12.525) / 4 = 13.44625\n        For hour 1: (16.611 + 9.846 + 14.468 + 11.855) / 4 = 13.195\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Then for the next 4 days? Actually, we are forecasting 4 days, so we will have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n        Day5 (2016-09-15) 00:00:00 -> 13.44625\n        Day5 01:00:00 -> 13.195\n        ...\n        Day5 23:00:00 -> (8.707 + 10.784 + 11.989 + 9.779) / 4 = 10.31475\n\n        Then Day6 (2016-09-16) 00:00:00 -> same as Day5 00:00:00? Actually, we are using the same hourly average for every day.\n\n     But note: the problem does not specify that the pattern is the same for every day? However, with only 4 days of history, we cannot capture weekly patterns.\n\n     Therefore, we will use the same 24 hourly means for each of the 4 forecasted days.\n\n     However, we must generate the dates:\n\n        The last date is 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n        The next date is 2016-09-15 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n     We can generate the next 96 timestamps by starting from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 and adding 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        Let base_date = 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n        Then for i in range(0,96):\n            date = base_date + i * timedelta(hours=1)\n\n        Then assign the HUFL value for that hour by the average we computed for that hour (i.e., the hour of the day).\n\n     How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the values.\n\n     But note: the provided data has 4 days, so we have 4 values for each hour.\n\n     Implementation:\n\n        We'll create a dictionary for each hour (0-23) and then for each hour, we'll collect the 4 values and average.\n\n     However, note: the data is in a fixed block of 4 days. We can reshape the HUFL into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the day axis.\n\n     But let's check: the first day is 2016-09-11 (Sunday) to 2016-09-14 (Wednesday). The next days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday? \n     But we are not accounting for weekly seasonality? We don't have enough data.\n\n     So we stick to daily seasonality.\n\n     Let's code:\n\n        hours = [0,1,...,23] -> 24 hours.\n\n        avg_hufl = [0]*24\n\n        For hour in range(0,24):\n            indices = [hour + i*24 for i in range(0,4)]   # because we have 4 days, 24 hours per day\n            values = [hufl[i] for i in indices]\n            avg_hufl[hour] = sum(values) / len(values)\n\n        Then for the forecast:\n\n            for i in range(0,96):\n                hour_of_day = i % 24\n                forecast_hufl = avg_hufl[hour_of_day]\n\n     But note: the data we are given is exactly 96 points (4*24). So we can reshape the HUFL array into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along axis=0.\n\n     However, we must be cautious: the data is in order? Yes, from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n     Let's do:\n\n        import numpy as np\n        But we are not allowed to use code? We have to compute manually? Actually, we are to provide the data.\n\n     We can compute the averages manually? It's 24 averages, each with 4 numbers.\n\n     Alternatively, we can write a small program in our mind and compute.\n\n     But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n     We'll compute the 24 averages and then assign them to the next 4 days.\n\n     Let me compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): (17.348 + 9.310 + 14.602 + 12.525) /

6.27925, 7.81975, 10.31475]\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n     The dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-09-15 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-15 23:00:00 -> uses the 24 values above in order.\n        Then 2016-09-16 00:00:00: same as 2016-09-15 00:00:00 -> 13.44625, and so on.\n\n     We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n     Format:\n\n        date, HUFL\n\n     We must output the HUFL with 6 decimal places? The input had 3 to 6 decimal places. We'll output with 6 to be safe.\n\n     But note: the input had up to 3 decimal places? Actually, we see 3 decimal places. But we computed averages have more. We'll round to 6 decimal places? \n     The problem does not specify. We'll output as we computed.\n\n     However, the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n     We'll output the numbers as we computed (with the precision we have) but we'll format to 6 decimal places to match the input.\n\n     But note: the input had 3 decimal places for some, but we have computed averages that might have more. We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n     Example:\n\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00,13.446250\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00,13.195000\n        ...\n\n     But note: the input had 3 decimal places? Actually, the input had 3 to 6 digits? For example: 17.348000 -> 6 digits.\n\n     So we'll output 6 digits.\n\n     Steps:\n\n        We have a list of 24 values: let's call it hourly_avg.\n\n        Then for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date = datetime(2016,9,15) + timedelta(days=day_offset, hours=hour)\n                HUFL = hourly_avg[hour]\n\n        But note: the first day is 2016-09-15 (which is Thursday) and we are adding 0,1,2,3 days.\n\n        The dates:\n\n            day0: 2016-09-15\n            day1: 2016-09-16\n            day2: 2016-09-17\n            day3: 2016-09-18\n\n        We must output in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n     We'll generate the dates as strings.\n\n     However, we are to output in the exact format.\n\n     We'll write:\n\n        base_date = \"2016-09-15\"\n        Then for i in range(0,96):\n            date_str = base_date + \" \" + (hour string) \n\n        How to format the hour: \n            hour 0: \"00:00:00\"\n            hour 1: \"01:00:00\"\n            ...\n            hour 23: \"23:00:00\"\n\n        Then for the next day, we change the day.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            from datetime import datetime, timedelta   [But we are not coding, we are writing the output]\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n            Then 2016-09-15 01:00:00\n            ...\n            Then 2016-09-15 23:00:00\n            Then 2016-09-16 00:00:00\n            ... until 2016-09-18 23:00:00\n\n     We'll generate:\n\n        dates = []\n        base = datetime(2016, 9, 15)\n        for i in range(0,96):\n            d = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(d.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n     But we are to write the data without using code? We can compute the dates:\n\n        Day 5: 2016-09-15: hours 00 to 23 -> 24 hours\n        Day 6: 2016-09-16: hours 00 to 23 -> 24 hours\n        Day 7: 2016-09-17: hours 00 to 23 -> 24 hours\n        Day 8: 2016-09-18: hours 00 to 23 -> 24 hours\n\n     We'll write:\n\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00, <hour0_avg>\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00, <hour1_avg>\n        ...\n        2016-09-15 23:00:00, <hour23_avg>\n        2016-09-16 00:00:00, <hour0_avg>\n        ...\n        2016-09-18 23:00:00, <hour23_avg>\n\n     We have the list of 24 averages. We'll repeat it 4 times.\n\n     We'll write the data in the answer.\n\n     But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the history, but we are to be cautious? \n        We are forecasting, so we are generating the next 96 without missing? \n\n     We are to provide the complete data, so we must not have any.\n\n     We'll output 96 rows.\n\n     Let me write the first few:\n\n        date                HUFL\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 13.446250\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00 13.195000\n        2016-09-15 02:00:00 13.479750\n        2016-09-15 03:00:00 12.391250\n        2016-09-15 04:00:00 11.721500\n        2016-09-15 05:00:00 12.324250\n        2016-09-15 06:00:00 14.049250\n        2016-09-15 07:00:00 13.094750\n        2016-09-15 08:00:00 11.102000\n        2016-09-15 09:00:00 8.422750\n        2016-09-15 10:00:00 8.741000\n        2016-09-15 11:00:00 8.657250\n        2016-09-15 12:00:00 6.865500\n        2016-09-15 13:00:00 6.731500\n        2016-09-15 14:00:00 6.765000\n        2016-09-15 15:00:00 6.731500\n        2016-09-15 16:00:00 6.312750\n        2016-09-15 17:00:00 7.200500\n        2016-09-15 18:00:00 6.580750\n        2016-09-15 19:00:00 7.250750\n        2016-09-15 20:00:00 6.982750\n        2016-09-15 21:00:00 6.279250\n        2016-09-15 22:00:00 7.819750\n        2016-09-15 23:00:00 10.314750\n\n        Then for 2016-09-16 00:00:00: 13.446250\n        and so on.\n\n     We'll write the entire 96 rows.\n\n     Note: We rounded the averages to 6 decimal places? Actually, we computed with more precision, but we output 6.\n\n     But note: 12.39125025 -> we output 12.391250? or 12.39125025? \n        The input had 3 decimal places? but we see 6. So we output 6.\n\n        We'll round to 6 decimal places.\n\n        Actually, we computed:\n\n            hour3: 12.39125025 -> we can output 12.391250\n\n        But let's be consistent: we'll output 6 decimal digits.\n\n        We can do: format as %.6f\n\n     We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n     However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we must output all 96 rows.\n\n     We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n     Let me write the first 24 (for 2016-09-15) and then the next 24 will be the same pattern.\n\n     We'll generate:\n\n        dates: \n          for day in [15,16,17,18]:\n            for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n                date_str = \"2016-09-%02d %02d:00:00\" % (day, hour)\n\n        But note: the day 15,16,17,18: we sure? \n          2016-09-15, 16, 17, 18.\n\n        But 2016-09-15 is Thursday?
