        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00) for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data is at hourly frequency, we can use:\n    - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) because of potential seasonality (daily pattern: 24 hours).\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) if seasonality is present.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but given the small data (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96 forecasts, a classical method might be more appropriate.\n\n 3. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (24 hours). For example, the load drops during certain hours (like at night) and rises during the day? \n    - However, the values are negative and positive, so it might be normalized. We don't have context on normalization.\n\n 4. We'll use a model that can capture seasonality. Since the seasonality is 24 hours (daily) and we have hourly data, we set seasonal period to 24.\n\n 5. We'll use SARIMA. We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24). We can try to automatically select the best parameters via grid search, but due to the small data and the fact that we are to generate 96 points, we can use a standard approach.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like ExponentialSmoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) because the data might have a trend and seasonality.\n\n 7. However, note: the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short time series for fitting a seasonal model with 24 periods. We might have to do with a simple model.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can try:\n    - Using a naive seasonal model: forecast each hour of the next day by the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use an automated method like auto_arima from the pmdarima library to select the best parameters. But since we are to code without libraries, we have to think of a method.\n\n 10. But note: the problem does not specify the tools. Since we are an AI, we can use a simulated method.\n\n 11. However, the problem says: \"You are an expert in time series forecasting\". We must provide a forecast.\n\n 12. Approach:\n     - We'll use a simple average of the same hour from the available days (4 days) to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours). Why 4 days? Because we have 4 days of history and we are to forecast 4 days.\n\n     Steps for the simple method:\n        For hour 00:00: we have 4 values (from 2017-03-06, 2017-03-07, 2017-03-08, 2017-03-09). We average these to get the forecast for 2017-03-10 00:00:00, and then use the same average for 2017-03-11 00:00:00, 2017-03-12 00:00:00, 2017-03-13 00:00:00? \n        But that would be the same value for each day at 00:00. However, we want to capture the pattern of the week? But we only have 4 days and they are consecutive? And we don't know if they are weekdays or weekends.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-03-09) as a template and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 13. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next day? But we are to forecast 4 days. We can use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days? \n\n     Specifically:\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n        Then, for the next 4 days, we use that average for the same hour.\n\n     Example:\n        Hour 00:00: average of [-0.036, -0.497, 0.036, -0.071] = (-0.036 -0.497 +0.036 -0.071)/4 = (-0.568)/4 = -0.142\n        Then for 2017-03-10 00:00:00, 2017-03-11 00:00:00, 2017-03-12 00:00:00, 2017-03-13 00:00:00 we use -0.142.\n\n     But note: the data shows variation per day. However, without more data, this might be a simple and robust method.\n\n 14. However, we note that the data might have a trend? Looking at the last day (2017-03-09) the values at the end are very negative. But we are only 4 days, so we cannot capture a long-term trend.\n\n 15. We decide to use the average by hour method.\n\n 16. Steps:\n      - Group the data by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean for each of the 24 hours.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean for hour 0 to the 00:00 of each day, hour 1 to 01:00, etc.\n\n 17. How to handle missing values? The problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't have to handle missing in the input.\n\n 18. We'll calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n     Let's compute:\n\n        hour0: [2017-03-06 00:00:00: -0.036, 2017-03-07 00:00:00: -0.497, 2017-03-08 00:00:00: 0.036, 2017-03-09 00:00:00: -0.071] -> (-0.036 -0.497 +0.036 -0.071)/4 = (-0.568)/4 = -0.142\n\n        hour1: [0.284, 0.036, 0.000, -0.604] -> (0.284+0.036+0.000-0.604)/4 = (-0.284)/4 = -0.071\n\n        hour2: [-1.564, -0.107, -0.249, -1.066] -> (-1.564 -0.107 -0.249 -1.066)/4 = (-2.986)/4 = -0.7465\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 19. Then, for the next 4 days (2017-03-10 to 2017-03-13), we assign:\n\n        2017-03-10 00:00:00: -0.142\n        2017-03-10 01:00:00: -0.071\n        2017-03-10 02:00:00: -0.7465\n        ... until 23:00:00\n\n        and then repeat the same 24 numbers for 2017-03-11, 2017-03-12, 2017-03-13.\n\n 20. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not told about the next 96 having missing? We are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 numbers without missing.\n\n 21. However, this method does not account for any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture trend. Alternatively, we could use the last day (2017-03-09) as the base and adjust by the average daily change? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 22. We'll stick to the average by hour.\n\n 23. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n        hour0: (-0.036, -0.497, 0.036, -0.071) -> (-0.036 -0.497 +0.036 -0.071) = -0.568 -> -0.142\n        hour1: (0.284, 0.036, 0.000, -0.604) -> (0.284+0.036+0.000-0.604) = -0.284 -> -0.071\n        hour2: (-1.564, -0.107, -0.249, -1.066) -> (-1.564-0.107-0.249-1.066) = -2.986 -> -0.7465\n        hour3: (0.213, -0.071, -0.320, -1.066) -> (0.213-0.071-0.320-1.066) = -1.244 -> -0.311\n        hour4: (-0.249, -0.213, -0.640, 0.000) -> (-0.249-0.213-0.640+0.000) = -1.102 -> -0.2755\n        hour5: (0.142, -0.284, -0.391, -0.533) -> (0.142-0.284-0.391-0.533) = -1.066 -> -0.2665\n        hour6: (-1.244, -0.711, -1.315, -0.569) -> (-1.244-0.711-1.315-0.569) = -3.839 -> -0.95975\n        hour7: (-0.817, -1.315, -0.924, -0.853) -> (-0.817-1.315-0.924-0.853) = -3.909 -> -0.97725\n        hour8: (-0.249, -0.462, -0.391, -0.355) -> (-0.249-0.462-0.391-0.355) = -1.457 -> -0.36425\n        hour9: (-1.102, -2.168, -0.213, 0.000) -> (-1.102-2.168-0.213+0.000) = -3.483 -> -0.87075\n        hour10: (0.213, -1.173, 0.071, 0.249) -> (0.213-1.173+0.071+0.249) = -0.64 -> -0.16\n        hour11: (0.355, 0.000, 0.569, 0.071) -> (0.355+0.000+0.569+0.071) = 0.995 -> 0.24875\n        hour12: (0.142, -0.142, -0.640, -0.320) -> (0.142-0.142-0.640-0.320) = -0.96 -> -0.24\n        hour13: (0.391, 0.426, 0.142, 0.675) -> (0.391+0.426+0.142+0.675) = 1.634 -> 0.4085\n        hour14: (0.533, 0.249, 0.036, -0.178) -> (0.533+0.249+0.036-0.178) = 0.64 -> 0.16\n        hour15: (-0.071, -0.142, -0.213, -0.036) -> (-0.071-0.142-0.213-0.036) = -0.462 -> -0.1155\n        hour16: (-1.421, -1.777, -1.137, -1.102) -> (-1.421-1.777-1.137-1.102) = -5.437 -> -1.35925\n        hour17: (-1.741, -1.883, -1.599, -1.564) -> (-1.741-1.883-1.599-1.564) = -6.787 -> -1.69675\n        hour18: (-2.452, -2.452, -2.487, -2.345) -> (-2.452-2.452-2.487-2.345) = -9.736 -> -2.434\n        hour19: (-2.132, -2.594, -2.274, -2.345) -> (-2.132-2.594-2.274-2.345) = -9.345 -> -2.33625\n        hour20: (-2.274, -2.523, -2.345, -2.345) -> (-2.274-2.523-2.345-2.345) = -9.487 -> -2.37175\n        hour21: (-0.711, -2.452, -2.203, -3.553) -> (-0.711-2.452-2.203-3.553) = -8.919 -> -2.22975\n        hour22: (-1.564, -1.741, -2.487, -3.127) -> (-1.564-1.741-2.487-3.127) = -8.919 -> -2.22975\n        hour23: (-0.355, 0.071, -1.848, -0.497) -> (-0.355+0.071-1.848-0.497) = -2.629 -> -0.65725\n\n 24. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-10 23:00:00: use the 24 averages we computed above in order.\n        Day 2: 2017-03-11 00:00:00 to 2017-03-11 23:00:00: same 24 averages.\n        Day 3: 2017-03-12 00:00:00 to 2017-03-12 23:00:00: same 24 averages.\n        Day 4: 2017-03-13 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00: same 24 averages.\n\n 25. We must generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-10 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-03-09 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-03-10 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-13 23:00:00.\n\n 26. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, with two columns: 'date' and 'MULL'. The MULL values are the averages we computed.\n\n 27. We output 96 rows.\n\n 28. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 29. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output all 96 rows.\n\n 30. Let's code the output.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are generating the forecast without missing. We are providing the complete forecast.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    We'll generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-03-10 00:00:00.\n\n    We have the 24 averages for the hours. We'll store them in a list:\n\n        hourly_avg = [-0.142, -0.071, -0.7465, -0.311, -0.2755, -0.2665, -0.95975, -0.97725, -0.36425, -0.87075, -0.16, 0.24875, -0.24, 0.4085, 0.16, -0.1155, -1.35925, -1.69675, -2.434, -2.33625, -2.37175, -2.22975, -2.22975, -0.65725]\n\n    Then for each day in [10,11,12,13] of March 2017, we assign the 24 values.\n\n 31. We must be cautious: the last day in the input is 2017-03-09, so the next day is 2017-03-10.\n\n 32. We generate:\n\n        for day in range(10, 14):   # 10,11,12,13\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date = f\"2017-03-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = hourly_avg[hour]\n\n 33. But note: the day 10,11,12,13: we must format with two digits.\n\n 34. However, the date format in the input: \"2017-03-06 00:00:00\", so we use:\n\n        day 10: \"2017-03-10\"\n        hour 0: \"00:00:00\", hour 1: \"01:00:00\", ... hour 23: \"23:00:00\"\n\n 35. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-10 00:00:00 -0.142\n2017-03-10 01:00:00 -0.071\n2017-03-10 02:00:00 -0.7465\n...\n2017-03-13 23:00:00 -0.65725\n```\n\n 36. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? We see values like -0.036, 0.284, etc. We'll round to 3 decimal places? \n\n    The computed averages have more than 3 decimal places. We should round to 3 decimal places to match.\n\n    Example: -0.142 -> -0.142 (already 3 decimal) but -0.7465 -> -0.747? \n\n    We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. Rounding:\n\n        -0.142 -> -0.142\n        -0.071 -> -0.071\n        -0.7465 -> -0.747 (if we round half up: 0.7465 -> 0.747? but negative: same as absolute value: round(-0.7465, 3) -> -0.747)\n\n        Let's do: \n            -0.7465: the fourth decimal is 5 -> round up the third decimal from 6 to 7 -> -0.747\n\n        We'll use standard rounding.\n\n 38. We recalc with rounding to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: -0.142\n        hour1: -0.071\n        hour2: -0.7465 -> -0.747\n        hour3: -0.311\n        hour4: -0.2755 -> -0.276\n        hour5: -0.2665 -> -0.267\n        hour6: -0.95975 -> -0.960\n        hour7: -0.97725 -> -0.977\n        hour8: -0.36425 -> -0.364\n        hour9: -0.87075 -> -0.871\n        hour10: -0.16 -> -0.160\n        hour11: 0.24875 -> 0.249\n        hour12: -0.24 -> -0.240\n        hour13: 0.4085 -> 0.409\n        hour14: 0.16 -> 0.160\n        hour15: -0.1155 -> -0.116\n        hour16: -1.35925 -> -1.359\n        hour17: -1.69675 -> -1.697\n        hour18: -2.434 -> -2.434\n        hour19: -2.33625 -> -2.336\n        hour20: -2.37175 -> -2.372\n        hour21: -2.22975 -> -2.230\n        hour22: -2.22975 -> -2.230\n        hour23: -0.65725 -> -0.657\n\n 39.
