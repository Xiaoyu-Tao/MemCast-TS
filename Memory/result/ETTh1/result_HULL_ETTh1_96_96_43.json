        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series pattern with potential daily seasonality (24 hours in a day).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the next 96 might have missing values? \n    However, the instruction says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n    This might refer to the fact that the provided data could have had missing values, but in this case, we are given 96 consecutive hours without missing values.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 5. However, note that the data shows:\n    - A daily pattern: for example, on each day we see a peak and a trough.\n    - The values are negative and positive, so we can consider a model that accounts for seasonality.\n\n 6. We are to provide missing values? The problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" but it is not clear if the next 96 will have missing values? \n    Actually, the instruction says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates, and please help me forecast the data for next 96 recorded dates. But please note that these data will have missing values\"\n\n    This is ambiguous. It might mean that the provided past data has missing values? But in the given data, there are 96 consecutive points without gaps.\n\n    Alternatively, it might mean that the future data (which we are to forecast) might have missing values? But we are to forecast the next 96, and we must provide the complete data.\n\n    Clarification: The problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must output 96 points without missing values.\n\n    So we interpret: the provided past data might have had missing values (but in this case, it doesn't) and we are to forecast 96 points without missing values.\n\n 7. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal model. Since the seasonality is 24 hours, we have 24 periods in a season.\n\n    We can use:\n      - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by taking the same hour from the last available day.\n      - But we have 4 days of data. We can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? Or use the last day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day.\n\n    However, let's look at the data: \n        The last day (2016-12-23) is the 4th day. We can use the values of 2016-12-23 for 2016-12-24, then 2016-12-25 would be the same as 2016-12-20? \n        But that might not be the best because the pattern might be changing.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) with additive seasonality and a seasonality of 24.\n\n    But note: we only have 4 days (96 points) and we are to forecast 4 days (96 points). This is a very short series for fitting a Holt-Winters model.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we choose a simple method: use the last complete season (last 24 hours) and repeat it for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n    Why? Because the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data. We must output 96 points.\n\n    Steps for the simple method:\n        - The last 24 hours: from 2016-12-23 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n        - We will use these 24 values and repeat them 4 times to get 96 points.\n\n    However, let's check if there is a trend? The data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days. It fluctuates daily.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"High UseLess Load\", which might be a derived metric. Without more context, we assume that the daily pattern is the dominant feature.\n\n 9. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n        Start: 2016-12-24 00:00:00\n        Then: 2016-12-24 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n 10. The forecast for:\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00 = value of 2016-12-23 00:00:00 (which is 1.072)\n        2016-12-24 01:00:00 = value of 2016-12-23 01:00:00 (1.808)\n        ... \n        until 2016-12-24 23:00:00 = value of 2016-12-23 23:00:00 (1.273)\n\n        Then 2016-12-25 00:00:00 = value of 2016-12-23 00:00:00 (1.072) again, and so on.\n\n 11. However, note that the data for 2016-12-23 might be an outlier? But we are using the most recent day.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days? But that would smooth out the pattern and we only have 4 days.\n\n    Let's compare:\n\n        Option 1: Use only the last day (2016-12-23) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n        Option 2: Use the average of each hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to be quick, and because the last day might be the most representative (especially if there are changes in the pattern), we choose Option 1.\n\n 13. But note: the problem says \"You are an expert\", so we should use a more robust method? However, with only 4 days, complex models might overfit.\n\n 14. We decide to use the last seasonal cycle (last 24 hours) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n 15. The last 24 hours (2016-12-23) data:\n\n        date                HULL\n        2016-12-23 00:00:00  1.072\n        2016-12-23 01:00:00  1.808\n        2016-12-23 02:00:00  1.808\n        2016-12-23 03:00:00  1.674\n        2016-12-23 04:00:00  1.608\n        2016-12-23 05:00:00  0.871\n        2016-12-23 06:00:00  1.005\n        2016-12-23 07:00:00  1.674\n        2016-12-23 08:00:00  2.143\n        2016-12-23 09:00:00  0.469\n        2016-12-23 10:00:00  0.871\n        2016-12-23 11:00:00  0.804\n        2016-12-23 12:00:00 -0.402\n        2016-12-23 13:00:00  0.804\n        2016-12-23 14:00:00  0.938\n        2016-12-23 15:00:00  0.335\n        2016-12-23 16:00:00  0.067\n        2016-12-23 17:00:00 -0.268\n        2016-12-23 18:00:00 -1.139\n        2016-12-23 19:00:00 -0.871\n        2016-12-23 20:00:00 -0.804\n        2016-12-23 21:00:00 -1.206\n        2016-12-23 22:00:00  0.871\n        2016-12-23 23:00:00  1.273\n\n 16. We will generate 4 copies of this 24-hour pattern.\n\n 17. The dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-24 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2016-12-25 00:00:00 to 2016-12-25 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2016-12-26 00:00:00 to 2016-12-26 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2016-12-27 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00\n\n 18. We output the data in the same format as the input, with two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'.\n\n 19. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 20. Code for generating the dates and the repeated values:\n\n        base_dates = pd.date_range(start='2016-12-24 00:00:00', periods=96, freq='H')\n        base_pattern = [1.072, 1.808, 1.808, 1.674, 1.608, 0.871, 1.005, 1.674, 2.143, 0.469, 0.871, 0.804, -0.402, 0.804, 0.938, 0.335, 0.067, -0.268, -1.139, -0.871, -0.804, -1.206, 0.871, 1.273]\n        forecasted_values = base_pattern * 4   # This will repeat the pattern 4 times\n\n 21. Then we create a DataFrame with these dates and values.\n\n 22. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are to provide the complete data. So we are generating without missing values.\n\n 23. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 24. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 25. We write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date                 HULL\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00  1.072\n        2016-12-24 01:00:00  1.808\n        ... \n        2016-12-27 23:00:00  1.273\n\n        </answer>\n\n 26. However, we are repeating the same pattern 4 times. This is a simple and common approach for short-term forecasting with strong seasonality.\n\n 27. Let's do it.\n\n 28. We note: the last day of the provided data is 2016-12-23, so the next day starts at 2016-12-24.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    We'll generate the dates and the repeated values.\n\n    The pattern for one day (24 hours) is the last 24 points of the given data.\n\n    We have 4 days, so we repeat the pattern 4 times.\n\n 29. The values for the last 24 hours (2016-12-23) are:\n\n        [1.072, 1.808, 1.808, 1.674, 1.608, 0.871, 1.005, 1.674, 2.143, 0.469, 0.871, 0.804, -0.402, 0.804, 0.938, 0.335, 0.067, -0.268, -1.139, -0.871, -0.804, -1.206, 0.871, 1.273]\n\n 30. We output 96 rows.\n\n 31. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 32. Note: The problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", meaning we must output all 96 points.\n\n 33. We do not have any missing values in our forecast because we are repeating the pattern.\n\n 34. We output the data in the example format, with the date and the value.\n\n 35. We use the same precision (3 decimal places) as the input.\n\n 36. We generate the dates: from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n 37. We write the answer in the markdown code block as specified.\n\n Let's code it in Python for clarity (but we are to output the text):\n\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    # The last 24 hours of the given data (2016-12-23)\n    last_day_values = [1.072, 1.808, 1.808, 1.674, 1.608, 0.871, 1.005, 1.674, 2.143, 0.469, 0.871, 0.804, -0.402, 0.804, 0.938, 0.335, 0.067, -0.268, -1.139, -0.871, -0.804, -1.206, 0.871, 1.273]\n\n    # Generate the next 96 hours (4 days) of dates\n    start_date = '2016-12-24 00:00:00'\n    dates = pd.date_range(start=start_date, periods=96, freq='H')\n\n    # Repeat the last_day_values 4 times\n    forecasted_hull = last_day_values * 4\n\n    # Create a list of strings for the output\n    # Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS  value\" with the value having 3 decimal places.\n\n    # But note: the example input has the date as string in the format \"2016-12-20 00:00:00\"\n\n    # We output:\n\n    output_lines = []\n    for i in range(96):\n        date_str = dates[i].strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n        value = forecasted_hull[i]\n        # Format the value to have 3 decimal places\n        output_lines.append(f\"{date_str}  {value:.3f}\")\n\n    Then we write the answer block.\n\n 38. However, we are to output in the exact format as the example, which has two columns: the date string and the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. We note that the example input has the value aligned? But we can just output as:\n\n        \"2016-12-24 00:00:00  1.072\"\n\n 40. We do it.\n\n 41. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output all 96 lines.\n\n 42. We write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n 43. Let's generate the output.\n",
