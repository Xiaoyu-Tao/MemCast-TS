        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete for modeling.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series model. Given the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (as seen by the fluctuations), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Since the data is relatively short (only 4 days) and we need to forecast 4 days, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 4. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily seasonality (24 hours in a day). So the seasonal period is 24.\n\n 5. We'll use the following approach:\n    a. Check for stationarity and differences if needed.\n    b. Fit a SARIMA model with seasonal order.\n\n 6. However, note: the data is very short (only 4 days) so we have only 4 seasonal cycles. This might be challenging.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like a seasonal naive method, but we want to capture potential patterns.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we'll use an automated approach to select the best SARIMA model using auto_arima from the pmdarima library (if available) or use a simple model.\n\n 9. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n 10. However, since we are in a simulated environment and cannot run actual code, we have to rely on a pre-defined method.\n\n 11. Given the instructions, we must provide the next 96 points. We'll generate the forecast using a reasonable method.\n\n 12. We'll use a simple method: \n     - The data shows a daily pattern. We can take the average of each hour across the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2016-07-12) and adjust it slightly? But that might not capture the trend.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the data, we'll use an automated forecasting procedure in our mind.\n\n 15. We'll use the following SARIMA model: (1,0,0) x (1,0,0,24) - but we don't have enough data to fit a complex model.\n\n 16. Since we must provide the data, we'll generate the forecast by:\n\n     a. Decomposing the series into trend and seasonal components (using moving averages) and then project the trend and repeat the seasonal pattern.\n\n     b. However, without actual computation, we can use the following:\n\n        - The data from 00:00 to 23:00 of each day:\n\n          Day 1: [3.340, 3.909, 3.944, 3.198, 3.482, 3.020, 3.056, 1.066, 1.102, 1.706, 1.244, 1.350, 0.853, 1.244, 1.564, 1.492, 1.528, 1.208, 1.208, 1.102, 1.812, 2.701, 3.553, 2.452]\n          Day 2: [2.736, 3.163, 3.234, 2.985, 2.452, 2.132, 1.919, 1.457, 2.203, 1.812, 1.706, 1.812, 1.137, 1.031, 0.711, 1.350, 0.888, 1.137, 1.421, 1.102, 1.279, 0.604, 1.315, 1.883]\n          Day 3: [2.701, 1.919, 1.777, 1.599, 1.599, 1.599, 2.097, 2.025, 1.564, 1.670, 1.812, 1.599, 0.569, 0.746, 0.995, 1.031, 1.244, 1.244, 0.746, 0.533, 0.604, 0.604, 1.208, 2.310]\n          Day 4: [2.310, 2.701, 3.482, 2.949, 2.452, 2.416, 1.848, 1.386, 1.599, 1.528, 1.421, 1.777, 0.959, 0.497, 0.959, 0.888, 0.462, 1.137, 0.604, 0.462, 0.533, 0.604, 1.706, 3.482]\n\n     c. We can compute the average for each hour of the day (across the 4 days) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the last day (day4) has a higher value at the end? \n\n     d. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and adjust by the average seasonal effect? \n\n 17. We decide to use the average of each hour over the 4 days. This is a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n     Steps for each hour (0 to 23) in a day:\n        forecast_hour = (day1[hour] + day2[hour] + day3[hour] + day4[hour]) / 4\n\n     Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat this 4 times? Actually, we have 4 days to forecast, so we use the same 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 18. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the average of each day:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day2: average = (sum)/24\n        Day3: average = (sum)/24\n        Day4: average = (sum)/24\n\n     We can compute:\n\n        Day1: 2.19 (approx)\n        Day2: 1.60 (approx)\n        Day3: 1.35 (approx)\n        Day4: 1.65 (approx)\n\n     There is no clear trend? It goes down then up. So we might just use the average pattern.\n\n 19. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (3.340 + 2.736 + 2.701 + 2.310) / 4 = 2.77175\n        hour1: (3.909 + 3.163 + 1.919 + 2.701) / 4 = 2.923\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day5: [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ... , avg_hour23]\n        Day6: same as Day5\n        Day7: same as Day5\n        Day8: same as Day5\n\n 21. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values. We are forecasting the next 96 points and we are to provide the complete data. So we will not have missing values in the forecast? We are to generate the complete 96 points.\n\n 22. However, this method is very naive and might not be the best. But given the ability to compute without a model, we do so.\n\n 23. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (3.340, 2.736, 2.701, 2.310) -> 2.77175\n        hour1: (3.909, 3.163, 1.919, 2.701) -> 2.923\n        hour2: (3.944, 3.234, 1.777, 3.482) -> 3.10925\n        hour3: (3.198, 2.985, 1.599, 2.949) -> 2.68275\n        hour4: (3.482, 2.452, 1.599, 2.452) -> 2.49625\n        hour5: (3.020, 2.132, 1.599, 2.416) -> 2.29175\n        hour6: (3.056, 1.919, 2.097, 1.848) -> 2.230\n        hour7: (1.066, 1.457, 2.025, 1.386) -> 1.4835\n        hour8: (1.102, 2.203, 1.564, 1.599) -> 1.617\n        hour9: (1.706, 1.812, 1.670, 1.528) -> 1.679\n        hour10: (1.244, 1.706, 1.812, 1.421) -> 1.54575\n        hour11: (1.350, 1.812, 1.599, 1.777) -> 1.6345\n        hour12: (0.853, 1.137, 0.569, 0.959) -> 0.8795\n        hour13: (1.244, 1.031, 0.746, 0.497) -> 0.8795\n        hour14: (1.564, 0.711, 0.995, 0.959) -> 1.05725\n        hour15: (1.492, 1.350, 1.031, 0.888) -> 1.19025\n        hour16: (1.528, 0.888, 1.244, 0.462) -> 1.0305\n        hour17: (1.208, 1.137, 1.244, 1.137) -> 1.1815\n        hour18: (1.208, 1.421, 0.746, 0.604) -> 0.99475\n        hour19: (1.102, 1.102, 0.533, 0.462) -> 0.79975\n        hour20: (1.812, 1.279, 0.604, 0.533) -> 1.057\n        hour21: (2.701, 0.604, 0.604, 0.604) -> 1.12825\n        hour22: (3.553, 1.315, 1.208, 1.706) -> 1.9455\n        hour23: (2.452, 1.883, 2.310, 3.482) -> 2.53175\n\n 24. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day5 (2016-07-13): [2.77175, 2.923, 3.10925, 2.68275, 2.49625, 2.29175, 2.230, 1.4835, 1.617, 1.679, 1.54575, 1.6345, 0.8795, 0.8795, 1.05725, 1.19025, 1.0305, 1.1815, 0.99475, 0.79975, 1.057, 1.12825, 1.9455, 2.53175]\n        Day6: same as Day5\n        Day7: same as Day5\n        Day8: same as Day5\n\n 25. But note: the dates must be generated. The last date in the input is 2016-07-12 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-13 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-07-16 23:00:00\n\n 26. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 27. However, the problem says the data may have missing values. But we are generating the forecast without missing values. So we output the 96 points.\n\n 28. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 29. But note: the input has 3 decimal places, but we computed with more. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 30. Let's round each value to 3 decimals.\n\n 31. Alternatively, we can use a better method? But given the constraints, we use this.\n\n 32. We'll write the forecast:\n\n        date, MULL\n        2016-07-13 00:00:00, 2.772\n        2016-07-13 01:00:00, 2.923\n        2016-07-13 02:00:00, 3.109\n        2016-07-13 03:00:00, 2.683\n        2016-07-13 04:00:00, 2.496\n        2016-07-13 05:00:00, 2.292\n        2016-07-13 06:00:00, 2.230\n        2016-07-13 07:00:00, 1.484\n        2016-07-13 08:00:00, 1.617\n        2016-07-13 09:00:00, 1.679\n        2016-07-13 10:00:00, 1.546\n        2016-07-13 11:00:00, 1.635\n        2016-07-13 12:00:00, 0.880\n        2016-07-13 13:00:00, 0.880\n        2016-07-13 14:00:00, 1.057\n        2016-07-13 15:00:00, 1.190\n        2016-07-13 16:00:00, 1.031\n        2016-07-13 17:00:00, 1.182\n        2016-07-13 18:00:00, 0.995\n        2016-07-13 19:00:00, 0.800\n        2016-07-13 20:00:00, 1.057\n        2016-07-13 21:00:00, 1.128\n        2016-07-13 22:00:00, 1.946\n        2016-07-13 23:00:00, 2.532\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 hours for the next 3 days.\n\n 33. But note: the average for hour12 and hour13 are both 0.8795 -> rounded to 0.880.\n\n 34. We'll generate 4 days of the same pattern.\n\n 35. However, we must note that the problem might expect a more sophisticated forecast. But without the ability to run code, we use this method.\n\n 36. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 37. Let's write the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 38.
