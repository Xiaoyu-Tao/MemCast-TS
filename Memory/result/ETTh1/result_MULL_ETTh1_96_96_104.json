        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a daily seasonality (24 hours) and also weekly patterns might be present, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not captured.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. But we are told to be aware of missing values. However, for forecasting, we assume the given data is complete for modeling.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle hourly data and daily patterns. Given the small data size (only 4 days), we might use a simple model like seasonal naive, or exponential smoothing with seasonality, or even a small LSTM/ARIMA model. However, the requirement is to provide the next 96 points.\n\n Considering the constraints and the fact that we have only 4 days, we can observe:\n   - The data shows a clear pattern: \n        * During the day (from 8:00 to 18:00) the load is generally higher.\n        * At night (especially 18:00 to 8:00) the load is lower.\n\n 4. Since we have only 4 days, we can use a seasonal naive approach: using the last day (or the average of the last few days) as the forecast for the next day. However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern (but we don't have a week of data). So we can use the daily pattern.\n\n Approach:\n   We can compute the average of the 4 days for each hour of the day and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the next 4 days might be similar to the previous 4 days? However, we don't have any trend or other information.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-24) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would ignore any potential differences in the days (like weekdays vs weekends). However, the given data is from Monday (2017-08-21) to Thursday (2017-08-24). The next 4 days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So we might expect a different pattern on the weekend.\n\n But we don't have weekend data in the history. So we have to rely on the available data.\n\n 6. Given the ambiguity, a safe approach is to use the average of the available 4 days for each hour and then project that for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n   - Group by hour of the day (so for hour 0, we have 4 values: 5.330, 4.229, 5.082, 4.548; for hour 1: 5.082, 4.442, 5.757, 4.087; etc.)\n   - Then the forecast for 2017-08-25 00:00:00 (which is hour 0 of the next day) would be the average of the 4 values for hour 0.\n\n 7. However, note that the data might have a trend? Looking at the 4 days, the values at the same hour do not show a clear increasing or decreasing trend. So averaging is acceptable.\n\n 8. But also note: the problem says there are missing values. We are not told which ones are missing in the provided data? The provided data has 96 points without any missing. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 9. We will create a table of 24 hours (0 to 23) and for each hour, we take the average of the 4 days.\n\n 10. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 11. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (5.330 + 4.229 + 5.082 + 4.548) / 4 = (5.330+4.229=9.559; 9.559+5.082=14.641; 14.641+4.548=19.189) -> 19.189/4 = 4.79725\n        hour1: (5.082 + 4.442 + 5.757 + 4.087) / 4 = (5.082+4.442=9.524; 9.524+5.757=15.281; 15.281+4.087=19.368) -> 19.368/4 = 4.842\n        ... and so on.\n\n 12. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 13. Then the forecast for:\n        2017-08-25 00:00:00 -> hour0: 4.79725\n        2017-08-25 01:00:00 -> hour1: 4.842\n        ... until 2017-08-25 23:00:00 -> hour23: average of the 23rd hour of the 4 days.\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n 14. However, note: the next 4 days are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. We might expect lower loads on the weekend? But without historical weekend data, we cannot adjust. So we use the same pattern.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we could use the last day (Thursday) for Friday, and then use the average of the entire 4 days for Saturday and Sunday? But that might be overcomplicating without enough data.\n\n 16. Given the instructions and the data, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. We must output the complete data for the next 96 dates (from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00) with the MULL values as the computed averages for the corresponding hour.\n\n 18. We'll compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [5.330, 4.229, 5.082, 4.548] -> mean = (5.330+4.229+5.082+4.548)/4 = 19.189/4 = 4.79725\n        hour1: [5.082, 4.442, 5.757, 4.087] -> (5.082+4.442+5.757+4.087)=19.368 -> 4.842\n        hour2: [5.153, 4.193, 4.868, 4.797] -> (5.153+4.193+4.868+4.797)=19.011 -> 4.75275\n        hour3: [5.224, 4.193, 4.548, 4.406] -> (5.224+4.193+4.548+4.406)=18.371 -> 4.59275\n        hour4: [5.188, 3.696, 5.472, 4.193] -> (5.188+3.696+5.472+4.193)=18.549 -> 4.63725\n        hour5: [4.584, 3.980, 4.939, 4.051] -> (4.584+3.980+4.939+4.051)=17.554 -> 4.3885\n        hour6: [5.153, 2.878, 3.589, 3.944] -> (5.153+2.878+3.589+3.944)=15.564 -> 3.891\n        hour7: [5.472, 3.696, 4.833, 4.620] -> (5.472+3.696+4.833+4.620)=18.621 -> 4.65525\n        hour8: [6.290, 2.949, 5.330, 4.975] -> (6.290+2.949+5.330+4.975)=19.544 -> 4.886\n        hour9: [5.330, 3.838, 4.406, 3.696] -> (5.330+3.838+4.406+3.696)=17.27 -> 4.3175\n        hour10: [7.071, 4.691, 5.295, 5.401] -> (7.071+4.691+5.295+5.401)=22.458 -> 5.6145\n        hour11: [7.569, 6.538, 6.005, 5.792] -> (7.569+6.538+6.005+5.792)=25.904 -> 6.476\n        hour12: [6.965, 6.254, 6.112, 6.112] -> (6.965+6.254+6.112+6.112)=25.443 -> 6.36075\n        hour13: [5.295, 6.645, 6.858, 6.681] -> (5.295+6.645+6.858+6.681)=25.479 -> 6.36975\n        hour14: [6.325, 6.929, 5.686, 5.934] -> (6.325+6.929+5.686+5.934)=24.874 -> 6.2185\n        hour15: [5.543, 5.721, 4.797, 4.584] -> (5.543+5.721+4.797+4.584)=20.645 -> 5.16125\n        hour16: [3.980, 3.802, 3.482, 3.198] -> (3.980+3.802+3.482+3.198)=14.462 -> 3.6155\n        hour17: [4.087, 2.559, 3.020, 3.092] -> (4.087+2.559+3.020+3.092)=12.758 -> 3.1895\n        hour18: [2.203, 2.736, 2.203, 2.168] -> (2.203+2.736+2.203+2.168)=9.31 -> 2.3275\n        hour19: [2.239, 2.772, 2.487, 2.310] -> (2.239+2.772+2.487+2.310)=9.808 -> 2.452\n        hour20: [3.411, 3.127, 2.772, 2.914] -> (3.411+3.127+2.772+2.914)=12.224 -> 3.056\n        hour21: [2.594, 2.168, 4.620, 3.411] -> (2.594+2.168+4.620+3.411)=12.793 -> 3.19825\n        hour22: [3.411, 3.767, 3.376, 4.264] -> (3.411+3.767+3.376+4.264)=14.818 -> 3.7045\n        hour23: [3.411, 4.300, 4.051, 5.082] -> (3.411+4.300+4.051+5.082)=16.844 -> 4.211\n\n 19. Now, we have 24 values. We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n        hour0: 4.797\n        hour1: 4.842\n        hour2: 4.753\n        hour3: 4.593\n        hour4: 4.637\n        hour5: 4.389\n        hour6: 3.891\n        hour7: 4.655\n        hour8: 4.886\n        hour9: 4.318\n        hour10: 5.615\n        hour11: 6.476\n        hour12: 6.361\n        hour13: 6.370\n        hour14: 6.219\n        hour15: 5.161\n        hour16: 3.616\n        hour17: 3.190\n        hour18: 2.328\n        hour19: 2.452\n        hour20: 3.056\n        hour21: 3.198\n        hour22: 3.705\n        hour23: 4.211\n\n 20. Then we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-08-25 (Friday) -> [4.797, 4.842, 4.753, ... , 4.211] (24 values)\n        Day2: 2017-08-26 (Saturday) -> same 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-08-27 (Sunday) -> same 24 values\n        Day4: 2017-08-28 (Monday) -> same 24 values\n\n 21. We must output the data in the same format: two columns, with the date in the format and the MULL value.\n\n 22. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-25 01:00:00, ... until 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n 23. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 24. Note: The problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast. We are not given any information about missing values in the forecast period, so we assume we are to provide a complete set.\n\n 25. We output the data in the answer block.\n\n However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We will round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let me recalculate the averages and round to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: (5.330+4.229+5.082+4.548)/4 = 19.189/4 = 4.79725 -> 4.797\n        hour1: (5.082+4.442+5.757+4.087)/4 = 19.368/4 = 4.842 -> 4.842\n        hour2: (5.153+4.193+4.868+4.797)/4 = 19.011/4 = 4.75275 -> 4.753\n        hour3: (5.224+4.193+4.548+4.406)/4 = 18.371/4 = 4.59275 -> 4.593\n        hour4: (5.188+3.696+5.472+4.193)/4 = 18.549/4 = 4.63725 -> 4.637\n        hour5: (4.584+3.980+4.939+4.051)/4 = 17.554/4 = 4.3885 -> 4.389\n        hour6: (5.153+2.878+3.589+3.944)/4 = 15.564/4 = 3.891 -> 3.891\n        hour7: (5.472+3.696+4.833+4.620)/4 = 18.621/4 = 4.65525 -> 4.655\n        hour8: (6.290+2.949+5.330+4.975)/4 = 19.544/4 = 4.886 -> 4.886\n        hour9: (5.330+3.838+4.406+3.696)/4 = 17.27/4 = 4.3175 -> 4.318\n        hour10: (7.071+4.691+5.295+5.401)/4 = 22.458/4 = 5.6145 -> 5.615\n        hour11: (7.569+6.538+6.005+5.792)/4 = 25.904/4 = 6.476 -> 6.476\n        hour12: (6.965+6.254+6.112+6.112)/4 = 25.443/4 = 6.36075 -> 6.361\n        hour13: (5.295+6.645+6.858+6.681)/4 = 25.479/4 = 6.36975 -> 6.370\n        hour14: (6.325+6.929+5.686+5.934)/4 = 24.874/4 = 6.2185 -> 6.219\n        hour15: (5.543+5.721+4.797+4.584)/4 = 20.645/4 = 5.16125 -> 5.161\n        hour16: (3.980+3.802+3.482+3.198)/4 = 14.462/4 = 3.6155 -> 3.616\n        hour17: (4.087+2.559+3.020+3.092)/4 = 12.758/4 = 3.1895 -> 3.190\n        hour18: (2.203+2.736+2.203+2.168)/4 = 9.31/4 = 2.3275 -> 2.328\n        hour19: (2.239+2.772+2.487+2.310)/4 = 9.808/4 = 2.452 -> 2.452\n        hour20: (3.411+3.127+2.772+2.914)/4 = 12.224/4 = 3.056 -> 3.056\n        hour21: (2.594+2.168+4.620+3.411)/4 = 12.793/4 = 3.19825 -> 3.198\n        hour22: (3.411+3.767+3.376+4.264)/4 = 14.818/4 = 3.7045 -> 3.705\n        hour23: (3.411+4.300+4.051+5.082)/4 = 16.844/4 = 4.211 -> 4.211\n\n 26.
