        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (4 days * 24 hours) of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL data, starting from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also there might be weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not evident.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data we are to forecast might have missing values? \n    Actually, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided past data might have missing values? \n    However, looking at the provided data, it has 96 consecutive hours without gaps. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 4. Since the data is hourly and we have a clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model. However, with only 4 days, building a complex model might be challenging.\n\n 5. We can use a simple approach: \n    - Decompose the series to capture the daily seasonality and then project forward.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: using the average of the same hour in the past 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n 6. But note: the data shows some non-stationarity and also the pattern on the first day (2016-09-11) is a bit different from the following days? \n    However, we have only 4 days. We can try to compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n 7. However, let's check the pattern:\n\n    Day 1 (2016-09-11): \n        Starts at 4.203, then drops to around 4.0, then rises to 5.117 at 06:00, then drops to 2.467 at 08:00, then stays around 2-3 until 17:00, then drops to 1.858 at 23:00.\n\n    Day 2 (2016-09-12): \n        Starts at 1.492, then gradually rises to 2.376 at 06:00, then stays around 2.5 until 20:00, then drops.\n\n    Day 3 (2016-09-13): \n        Starts at 4.082, then drops to 3.716, then rises to 4.813 at 06:00, then drops to 3.899 at 07:00, then drops to 1.371 at 08:00, then stays around 1-2 until 18:00, then jumps to 2.68 at 19:00 and then drops.\n\n    Day 4 (2016-09-14): \n        Starts at 1.828, then fluctuates, rises to 2.559 at 06:00, then around 2.2-2.7 until 20:00, then drops.\n\n 8. The pattern is not very consistent. Therefore, we might need a more robust method.\n\n 9. Given the small data, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality. But note: we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have only 4 days of history.\n\n 10. We can use the following approach:\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days we have, and then use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 11. However, the data on the first day (2016-09-11) is a Sunday? We don't have the day of week. But the data starts on a Sunday (2016-09-11 is Sunday). \n     Then 2016-09-12 Monday, 2016-09-13 Tuesday, 2016-09-14 Wednesday. The next 4 days would be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n 12. Since we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality, we ignore weekly and only use daily.\n\n 13. Steps for the method:\n     - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n     - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 14. But note: the data on the first day (Sunday) might be different from the weekdays? We have 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day? \n     However, we don't have enough data to separate. So we use the average of the 4 days.\n\n 15. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 0: (4.203 + 1.492 + 4.082 + 1.828) / 4 = (4.203+1.492+4.082+1.828)/4 = 11.605/4 = 2.90125\n     Hour 1: (4.173 + 1.371 + 3.990 + 1.645) / 4 = (4.173+1.371+3.990+1.645)/4 = 11.179/4 = 2.79475\n     ... and so on.\n\n 16. Then we create the next 96 hours (from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00) by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 17. However, note that the pattern might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing state space model with seasonality (Holt-Winters) but with 4 days, the initialization might be challenging.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete set, we choose the averaging method.\n\n 20. We must generate the dates: \n     - The last date in the input is 2016-09-14 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-09-15 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n 21. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 22. How to handle missing values in the forecast? The problem says the data we are to forecast might have missing values? \n     But note: the instruction says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided past data might have missing values? \n     However, the provided past data does not have missing values. And we are to forecast the next 96, and we are to provide the complete data. \n     So we are to generate 96 values without any missing.\n\n 23. Therefore, we will generate 96 values by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 24. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll create a list of 24 values (for hour0 to hour23) by averaging the 4 days.\n\n     Hour 0: (4.203, 1.492, 4.082, 1.828) -> average = (4.203+1.492+4.082+1.828)/4 = 11.605/4 = 2.90125\n     Hour 1: (4.173, 1.371, 3.990, 1.645) -> average = (4.173+1.371+3.990+1.645) = 11.179/4 = 2.79475\n     Hour 2: (4.082, 1.310, 3.716, 1.675) -> average = (4.082+1.310+3.716+1.675) = 10.783/4 = 2.69575\n     Hour 3: (3.868, 1.340, 3.960, 1.523) -> average = (3.868+1.340+3.960+1.523) = 10.691/4 = 2.67275\n     Hour 4: (4.021, 1.492, 3.868, 1.492) -> average = (4.021+1.492+3.868+1.492) = 10.873/4 = 2.71825\n     Hour 5: (4.569, 1.767, 4.173, 1.888) -> average = (4.569+1.767+4.173+1.888) = 12.397/4 = 3.09925\n     Hour 6: (5.117, 2.376, 4.813, 2.559) -> average = (5.117+2.376+4.813+2.559) = 14.865/4 = 3.71625\n     Hour 7: (4.965, 2.345, 3.899, 2.224) -> average = (4.965+2.345+3.899+2.224) = 13.433/4 = 3.35825\n     Hour 8: (2.467, 2.498, 1.371, 2.284) -> average = (2.467+2.498+1.371+2.284) = 8.62/4 = 2.155\n     Hour 9: (2.193, 2.528, 1.310, 2.193) -> average = (2.193+2.528+1.310+2.193) = 8.224/4 = 2.056\n     Hour 10: (2.589, 2.711, 1.553, 2.619) -> average = (2.589+2.711+1.553+2.619) = 9.472/4 = 2.368\n     Hour 11: (3.229, 2.772, 1.736, 2.711) -> average = (3.229+2.772+1.736+2.711) = 10.448/4 = 2.612\n     Hour 12: (2.345, 2.284, 1.249, 2.102) -> average = (2.345+2.284+1.249+2.102) = 7.98/4 = 1.995\n     Hour 13: (2.376, 2.163, 1.310, 2.254) -> average = (2.376+2.163+1.310+2.254) = 8.103/4 = 2.02575\n     Hour 14: (2.224, 1.980, 1.157, 2.254) -> average = (2.224+1.980+1.157+2.254) = 7.615/4 = 1.90375\n     Hour 15: (2.132, 2.102, 1.188, 1.949) -> average = (2.132+2.102+1.188+1.949) = 7.371/4 = 1.84275\n     Hour 16: (2.315, 2.224, 1.188, 1.949) -> average = (2.315+2.224+1.188+1.949) = 7.676/4 = 1.919\n     Hour 17: (2.650, 2.467, 1.279, 2.102) -> average = (2.650+2.467+1.279+2.102) = 8.498/4 = 2.1245\n     Hour 18: (2.315, 2.467, 1.249, 2.163) -> average = (2.315+2.467+1.249+2.163) = 8.194/4 = 2.0485\n     Hour 19: (2.376, 2.437, 2.680, 2.224) -> average = (2.376+2.437+2.680+2.224) = 9.717/4 = 2.42925\n     Hour 20: (2.041, 2.376, 2.741, 2.376) -> average = (2.041+2.376+2.741+2.376) = 9.534/4 = 2.3835\n     Hour 21: (1.767, 2.010, 2.680, 1.828) -> average = (1.767+2.010+2.680+1.828) = 8.285/4 = 2.07125\n     Hour 22: (1.584, 1.828, 2.193, 1.523) -> average = (1.584+1.828+2.193+1.523) = 7.128/4 = 1.782\n     Hour 23: (1.858, 1.736, 1.949, 1.462) -> average = (1.858+1.736+1.949+1.462) = 7.005/4 = 1.75125\n\n 25. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-09-15 (Thursday) from hour0 to hour23: [2.90125, 2.79475, 2.69575, 2.67275, 2.71825, 3.09925, 3.71625, 3.35825, 2.155, 2.056, 2.368, 2.612, 1.995, 2.02575, 1.90375, 1.84275, 1.919, 2.1245, 2.0485, 2.42925, 2.3835, 2.07125, 1.782, 1.75125]\n     Day 2: 2016-09-16 (Friday): same 24 values\n     Day 3: 2016-09-17 (Saturday): same 24 values\n     Day 4: 2016-09-18 (Sunday): same 24 values\n\n 26. We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 27. But note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We will round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 28. However, the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing values. \n     And the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n 29. Therefore, we output 96 rows of data.\n\n 30. Format the dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n     Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-09-18 23:00:00.\n\n 31. We write the data in the same format as the input: two columns: 'date' and 'LUFL'\n\n 32. We output in the required format.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages rounded to 3 decimal places:\n\n  H0: 2.90125 -> 2.901\n  H1: 2.79475 -> 2.795\n  H2: 2.69575 -> 2.696\n  H3: 2.67275 -> 2.673\n  H4: 2.71825 -> 2.718\n  H5: 3.09925 -> 3.099\n  H6: 3.71625 -> 3.716\n  H7: 3.35825 -> 3.358\n  H8: 2.155 -> 2.155\n  H9: 2.056 -> 2.056\n  H10: 2.368 -> 2.368\n  H11: 2.612 -> 2.612\n  H12: 1.995 -> 1.995\n  H13: 2.02575 -> 2.026\n  H14: 1.90375 -> 1.904\n  H15: 1.84275 -> 1.843\n  H16: 1.919 -> 1.919\n  H17: 2.1245 -> 2.125\n  H18: 2.0485 -> 2.049\n  H19: 2.42925 -> 2.429\n  H20: 2.3835 -> 2.384\n  H21: 2.07125 -> 2.071\n  H22: 1.782 -> 1.782\n  H23: 1.75125 -> 1.751\n\n 33. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n     2016-09-15 00:00:00  2.901\n     2016-09-15 01:00:00  2.795\n     ... until\n     2016-09-15 23:00:00  1.751\n\n     2016-09-16 00:00:00  2.901\n     ... and so on.\n\n 34. We write 4 full days.\n\n 35. We output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast and we are to provide the complete data. \n So we generate without missing.\n\n Let's code the output.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We output 96 rows.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n```\n2016-09-15 00:00:00 2.901\n2016-09-15 01:00:00 2.795\n... (96 lines)\n2016-09-18 23:00:00 1.751\n```\n\n    </answer>\n\n However, the example input had the date as index? But we are to output two columns: date and LUFL.\n\n We output as:\n\n        date                 LUFL\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 2.901\n        ...\n\n But the example input did not have a header? Actually, the input had:\n\n               date  LUFL\n 2016-09-11 00:00:00 4.203\n\n So we output without the header? The problem says \"complete data\", and the example input included the header? \n But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n And the example input was given without the header in the data rows? Actually, the example input had:\n\n        date  LUFL\n 2016-09-11 00:00:00 4.203\n\n But we are to output only the data? The problem says: \"the complete data\" meaning the 96 rows? \n\n Since the example input included a header, but the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and then listed 96 rows without the header? \n Actually, the example input had:\n\n        date  LUFL\n 2016-09-11 00:00:00 4.203\n ... \n\n But when we output, we are to output in the same format? \n\n However, the instruction for the answer format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n And the example input was given without the header in the code block? \n\n We decide to output without the header, just the 96 rows of:\n\n        [date string] [value]\n\n with the date string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the value rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n But note: the example input had the date as index? Actually, the example input had the date as a column? \n\n We output:\n\n        2016-09-15 00:00:00 2.901\n        2016-09-15 01:00:00 2.795\n        ...\n\n 36. We generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-09-15 00:00:00\n     End: 2016-09-18 23:00:00\n\n 37. We have 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n 38. We create a list of dates:\n\n     from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n     start_date = datetime(2016, 9, 15, 0, 0, 0)\n     then add 0,1,...,95 hours.\n\n 39. But we are writing the code in our mind? We can generate:\n\n     dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n 40. Then the LUFL values: we have a list of 24 values (the hourly averages) and we repeat it 4 times.\n\n 41. We output:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            date_str = (start_date + timedelta(hours=i)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            value = hourly_avg[i % 24]\n            print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")\n\n 42. But note: the hourly_avg list we computed above for the 24 hours.\n\n 43. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, we are not allowed to use code?
