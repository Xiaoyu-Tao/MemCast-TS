        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00) for the MULL (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a pattern (with daily seasonality of 24 hours), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the need for a forecast, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). \n    However, without the ability to run code, we must rely on a method that can be reasoned step by step.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - The data shows a daily pattern (with lower values during the day and higher at night? but looking at the data, it's not very clear). \n    - We can compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours). \n    - But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the last day (2017-03-21) has more negative values? \n\n 5. However, the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So for forecasting, we assume the pattern continues.\n\n 6. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 hours. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 7. Approach: \n    We can use the following:\n    - Calculate the hourly average for the same hour of the day over the 4 days we have 4 days: 18,19,20,21 March 2017.\n    - Then, we use these hourly averages as the forecast for the next 4 days (22,23,24,25 March 2017).\n\n    But note: the data might have a trend? We can also adjust for trend by taking the average of the last day and the previous days? \n    However, without a clear trend and with only 4 days, it's hard. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the overall change? \n\n 8. Let's try to compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We have 4 days, each with 24 hours. We can group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n    Example for hour 0: \n        2017-03-18 00:00:00: 0.355\n        2017-03-19 00:00:00: 0.391\n        2017-03-20 00:00:00: -0.036\n        2017-03-21 00:00:00: -1.031\n        Average = (0.355 + 0.391 -0.036 -1.031)/4 = (0.355+0.391=0.746; 0.746-0.036=0.71; 0.71-1.031=-0.321) -> -0.321/4 = -0.08025\n\n    Similarly for hour 1:\n        0.924, -0.107, -0.320, -1.421 -> (0.924 -0.107 -0.320 -1.421) = (0.924-0.107=0.817; 0.817-0.320=0.497; 0.497-1.421=-0.924) -> -0.924/4 = -0.231\n\n    But note: the data on 2017-03-21 is more negative. This might be a downward trend? \n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-21) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences between consecutive days? \n\n    However, the problem requires 96 points and we must provide the data. Since we are not running actual code, we have to use a simple method.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will use the hourly average over the 4 days as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 11. Steps for computation:\n      - Group the 96 points by hour of the day (0 to 23) -> 24 groups.\n      - For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values (from the 4 days).\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-03-22 to 2017-03-25), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 12. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data to capture weekly (only 4 days, which are consecutive). So we ignore weekly.\n\n 13. We generate the next 96 hours by repeating the 24 hourly means for 4 days.\n\n 14. However, we must account for the fact that the last day (21st) was more negative. But without a trend component, we are just averaging.\n\n 15. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n     Hour 0: (0.355 + 0.391 -0.036 -1.031)/4 = (0.355+0.391=0.746; 0.746-0.036=0.71; 0.71-1.031=-0.321) -> -0.08025\n     Hour 1: (0.924 -0.107 -0.320 -1.421)/4 = (0.924-0.107=0.817; 0.817-0.320=0.497; 0.497-1.421=-0.924) -> -0.231\n     Hour 2: (0.284 -0.284 -0.178 -0.959)/4 = (0.284-0.284=0; 0-0.178=-0.178; -0.178-0.959=-1.137) -> -0.28425\n     Hour 3: (-0.142 -0.107 +0.711 -1.883)/4 = (-0.142-0.107=-0.249; -0.249+0.711=0.462; 0.462-1.883=-1.421) -> -0.35525\n     Hour 4: (0.284 -0.462 +0.000 -1.706)/4 = (0.284-0.462=-0.178; -0.178+0.000=-0.178; -0.178-1.706=-1.884) -> -0.471\n     Hour 5: (-0.036 -1.102 -0.711 -1.457)/4 = (-0.036-1.102=-1.138; -1.138-0.711=-1.849; -1.849-1.457=-3.306) -> -0.8265\n     Hour 6: (-0.355 -1.990 -2.025 -1.919)/4 = (-0.355-1.990=-2.345; -2.345-2.025=-4.37; -4.37-1.919=-6.289) -> -1.57225\n     Hour 7: (0.071 -1.599 -0.071 -0.391)/4 = (0.071-1.599=-1.528; -1.528-0.071=-1.599; -1.599-0.391=-1.99) -> -0.4975\n     Hour 8: (0.284 -0.888 -0.497 -1.031)/4 = (0.284-0.888=-0.604; -0.604-0.497=-1.101; -1.101-1.031=-2.132) -> -0.533\n     Hour 9: (-1.528 -1.848 -1.350 -2.807)/4 = (-1.528-1.848=-3.376; -3.376-1.350=-4.726; -4.726-2.807=-7.533) -> -1.88325\n     Hour 10: (-1.066 -1.137 -0.746 -1.990)/4 = (-1.066-1.137=-2.203; -2.203-0.746=-2.949; -2.949-1.990=-4.939) -> -1.23475\n     Hour 11: (-0.711 -1.635 -1.528 -2.132)/4 = (-0.711-1.635=-2.346; -2.346-1.528=-3.874; -3.874-2.132=-6.006) -> -1.5015\n     Hour 12: (-2.168 -1.457 -2.274 -2.559)/4 = (-2.168-1.457=-3.625; -3.625-2.274=-5.899; -5.899-2.559=-8.458) -> -2.1145\n     Hour 13: (-1.137 -1.635 -2.203 +0.036)/4 = (-1.137-1.635=-2.772; -2.772-2.203=-4.975; -4.975+0.036=-4.939) -> -1.23475\n     Hour 14: (-0.888 -1.031 -1.777 -0.711)/4 = (-0.888-1.031=-1.919; -1.919-1.777=-3.696; -3.696-0.711=-4.407) -> -1.10175\n     Hour 15: (-1.066 -1.350 -2.203 -0.782)/4 = (-1.066-1.350=-2.416; -2.416-2.203=-4.619; -4.619-0.782=-5.401) -> -1.35025\n     Hour 16: (-1.457 -1.777 -1.954 -1.990)/4 = (-1.457-1.777=-3.234; -3.234-1.954=-5.188; -5.188-1.990=-7.178) -> -1.7945\n     Hour 17: (-1.706 -1.990 -1.990 -3.092)/4 = (-1.706-1.990=-3.696; -3.696-1.990=-5.686; -5.686-3.092=-8.778) -> -2.1945\n     Hour 18: (-2.345 -2.381 -2.274 -2.878)/4 = (-2.345-2.381=-4.726; -4.726-2.274=-7.0; -7.0-2.878=-9.878) -> -2.4695\n     Hour 19: (-2.345 -2.487 -1.848 -2.345)/4 = (-2.345-2.487=-4.832; -4.832-1.848=-6.68; -6.68-2.345=-9.025) -> -2.25625\n     Hour 20: (-2.416 -2.523 -2.239 -2.487)/4 = (-2.416-2.523=-4.939; -4.939-2.239=-7.178; -7.178-2.487=-9.665) -> -2.41625\n     Hour 21: (-2.452 -2.949 -2.452 -3.340)/4 = (-2.452-2.949=-5.401; -5.401-2.452=-7.853; -7.853-3.340=-11.193) -> -2.79825\n     Hour 22: (-1.066 -2.559 -1.244 -0.959)/4 = (-1.066-2.559=-3.625; -3.625-1.244=-4.869; -4.869-0.959=-5.828) -> -1.457\n     Hour 23: (-0.178 -1.173 -1.954 -0.817)/4 = (-0.178-1.173=-1.351; -1.351-1.954=-3.305; -3.305-0.817=-4.122) -> -1.0305\n\n 16. Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating these 24 hourly means for 4 days.\n\n 17. The next day starts at 2017-03-22 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-03-22 23:00:00, then 2017-03-23, 2017-03-24, 2017-03-25.\n\n 18. We output the data in the same format: \n        date and time in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", and the MULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 19. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We will round the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 20. Let's round the hourly means:\n\n     Hour 0: -0.08025 -> -0.080\n     Hour 1: -0.231 -> -0.231\n     Hour 2: -0.28425 -> -0.284\n     Hour 3: -0.35525 -> -0.355\n     Hour 4: -0.471 -> -0.471\n     Hour 5: -0.8265 -> -0.827\n     Note: rounding to 3 decimals: -0.8265 is -0.827 because 0.8265 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal from 6 to 7 -> -0.827\n     But note: negative numbers: rounding is towards the more negative? Actually, in absolute value: 0.8265 rounds to 0.827, so negative becomes -0.827.\n\n     We'll round each to 3 decimals.\n\n 21. We'll create a list of the 24 rounded means:\n\n     Hour0: -0.080\n     Hour1: -0.231\n     Hour2: -0.284\n     Hour3: -0.355\n     Hour4: -0.471\n     Hour5: -0.827\n     Hour6: -1.572\n     Hour7: -0.498   (because -0.4975 -> -0.498: 0.4975 rounded to 3 decimals: 0.498 -> so -0.498)\n     Hour8: -0.533\n     Hour9: -1.883\n     Hour10: -1.235\n     Hour11: -1.502\n     Hour12: -2.115\n     Hour13: -1.235\n     Hour14: -1.102\n     Hour15: -1.350\n     Hour16: -1.795\n     Hour17: -2.195\n     Hour18: -2.470\n     Hour19: -2.256\n     Hour20: -2.416\n     Hour21: -2.798\n     Hour22: -1.457\n     Hour23: -1.031   (because -1.0305 -> -1.031: 0.0305 rounded to 3 decimals: 0.031 -> so -1.031)\n\n 22. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n     Day 1: 2017-03-22\n        Hour0: 00:00:00 -> -0.080\n        Hour1: 01:00:00 -> -0.231\n        ... until hour23: 23:00:00 -> -1.031\n\n     Day 2: 2017-03-23: same 24 values\n     Day 3: 2017-03-24: same\n     Day 4: 2017-03-25: same\n\n 23. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 24. Note: The last provided data point is 2017-03-21 23:00:00. The next point is 2017-03-22 00:00:00.\n\n 25. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-22 00:00:00 -0.080\n2017-03-22 01:00:00 -0.231\n2017-03-22 02:00:00 -0.284\n... (and so on for 96 lines)\n        </answer>\n\n 26. We must be cautious: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast without missing values.\n\n 27. Since we are forecasting, we are generating the expected values. If the model had missing values, we would have imputed them, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 28. We output the 96 forecasted points.\n\n Let's write the first day (2017-03-22) and then the next three days.\n\n 2017-03-22 00:00:00: -0.080\n 2017-03-22 01:00:00: -0.231\n 2017-03-22 02:00:00: -0.284\n 2017-03-22 03:00:00: -0.355\n 2017-03-22 04:00:00: -0.471\n 2017-03-22 05:00:00: -0.827\n 2017-03-22 06:00:00: -1.572\n 2017-03-22 07:00:00: -0.498\n 2017-03-22 08:00:00: -0.533\n 2017-03-22 09:00:00: -1.883\n 2017-03-22 10:00:00: -1.235\n 2017-03-22 11:00:00: -1.502\n 2017-03-22 12:00:00: -2.115\n 2017-03-22 13:00:00: -1.235\n 2017-03-22 14:00:00: -1.102\n 2017-03-22 15:00:00: -1.350\n 2017-03-22 16:00:00: -1.795\n 2017-03-22 17:00:00: -2.195\n 2017-03-22 18:00:00: -2.470\n 2017-03-22 19:00:00: -2.256\n 2017-03-22 20:00:00: -2.416\n 2017-03-22 21:00:00: -2.798\n 2017-03-22 22:00:00: -1.457\n 2017-03-22 23:00:00: -1.031\n\n Then 2017-03-23: same 24 times.\n\n 29.
