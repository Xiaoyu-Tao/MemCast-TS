        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided sample, there are no missing values. So we assume that the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows some patterns (like daily seasonality), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. We note that the data has a daily seasonality (24 hours). So the seasonal period is 24.\n\n 5. However, with only 4 days of data, it is challenging to fit a model with multiple seasonal parameters. We can try a simple seasonal model.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like a seasonal naive forecast, but that would just repeat the last day. However, the problem asks for a forecast and the data might have trends and other patterns.\n\n 7. Considering the constraints, we can use an automated model like AutoARIMA that can select the best parameters. But note: we are in a simulated environment and we cannot run code. Therefore, we have to rely on a heuristic.\n\n 8. Let's observe the data: \n    - The data for each day shows a similar pattern: \n        * Values are higher during the night (00:00 to 07:00) of the first day, but then we see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n    - There is a drop during the day and then a peak again in the evening? But the pattern is not very clear.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without running actual code, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n    For example, for the next 00:00 (2016-10-05 00:00:00), we take the average of the 00:00 values of the previous 4 days: \n        2016-10-01 00:00:00: 9.712\n        2016-10-02 00:00:00: 8.172\n        2016-10-03 00:00:00: 11.320\n        2016-10-04 00:00:00: 11.320\n        Average = (9.712 + 8.172 + 11.320 + 11.320) / 4 = 10.131\n\n    Similarly, for 01:00: \n        2016-10-01 01:00:00: 9.846\n        2016-10-02 01:00:00: 6.497\n        2016-10-03 01:00:00: 10.985\n        2016-10-04 01:00:00: 10.583\n        Average = (9.846 + 6.497 + 10.985 + 10.583) / 4 = 9.47775\n\n 10. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality. However, it does not capture any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to determine a trend.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-04) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But that might be complex.\n\n 12. Since the problem does not specify the method and we must provide a forecast, we will use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days.\n\n 13. We note that the data for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00.\n\n 14. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 15. However, the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we assume the same for the forecast.\n\n 16. We will generate the next 96 hours by:\n      For hour h in [0, 23] for each of the next 4 days (day 5,6,7,8 of October 2016):\n          value = (value of hour h on day1 + day2 + day3 + day4) / 4\n\n 17. But note: the first day in our data is 2016-10-01 (day1), then 2016-10-02 (day2), 2016-10-03 (day3), 2016-10-04 (day4).\n\n 18. So for the next day (2016-10-05, which is day5) at hour h, we use the average of the same hour from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n 19. Similarly, for 2016-10-06 (day6) at hour h, we also use the same average? But that would be the same as day5. \n\n     However, we don't have a better method. Alternatively, we can use a moving window? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 20. Since we are forecasting 4 days ahead, and we don't have any trend, we will use the same daily pattern for all 4 forecasted days.\n\n     That is, the forecast for each day will be identical: the average of the previous 4 days for each hour.\n\n 21. But note: the problem does not specify that the pattern is stable. However, without more data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 22. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00: (9.712 + 8.172 + 11.320 + 11.320) / 4 = 10.131\n     Hour 01: (9.846 + 6.497 + 10.985 + 10.583) / 4 = 9.47775 -> 9.478 (rounded to 3 decimals as in the input)\n     Hour 02: (9.645 + 6.832 + 10.583 + 9.310) / 4 = 9.0925 -> 9.093\n     Hour 03: (8.975 + 6.497 + 11.052 + 10.315) / 4 = 9.20975 -> 9.210\n     Hour 04: (9.511 + 7.502 + 9.511 + 8.640) / 4 = 8.791 -> 8.791\n        Correction: The third value for hour 04 is from 2016-10-03 04:00:00? Actually, the data for hour 04:\n            2016-10-01 04:00:00: 9.511\n            2016-10-02 04:00:00: 7.502\n            2016-10-03 04:00:00: 9.511? But wait, the data for 2016-10-03 04:00:00 is 9.511? \n            Actually, in the provided data, 2016-10-03 04:00:00 is 9.511? Let me check:\n\n            The data for 2016-10-03:\n                2016-10-03 00:00:00 11.320\n                2016-10-03 01:00:00 10.985\n                2016-10-03 02:00:00 10.583\n                2016-10-03 03:00:00 11.052\n                2016-10-03 04:00:00 9.511   -> yes, 9.511\n\n        So: (9.511 + 7.502 + 9.511 + 8.640) = 35.164 -> 35.164/4 = 8.791\n\n     We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 23. Then, for each day in the forecast period (4 days: 2016-10-05 to 2016-10-08), we assign the 24-hour average pattern.\n\n 24. We must be cautious: the data has 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 25. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        hour00: (9.712, 8.172, 11.320, 11.320) -> (9.712+8.172+11.320+11.320)/4 = 40.524/4 = 10.131\n        hour01: (9.846, 6.497, 10.985, 10.583) -> (9.846+6.497+10.985+10.583)=37.911 -> 37.911/4=9.47775 -> 9.478\n        hour02: (9.645, 6.832, 10.583, 9.310) -> (9.645+6.832+10.583+9.310)=36.37 -> 36.37/4=9.0925 -> 9.093\n        hour03: (8.975, 6.497, 11.052, 10.315) -> (8.975+6.497+11.052+10.315)=36.839 -> 36.839/4=9.20975 -> 9.210\n        hour04: (9.511, 7.502, 9.511, 8.640) -> (9.511+7.502+9.511+8.640)=35.164 -> 35.164/4=8.791\n        hour05: (8.439, 5.693, 10.985, 8.372) -> (8.439+5.693+10.985+8.372)=33.489 -> 33.489/4=8.37225 -> 8.372\n        hour06: (9.846, 7.435, 11.655, 10.918) -> (9.846+7.435+11.655+10.918)=39.854 -> 39.854/4=9.9635 -> 9.964\n        hour07: (10.784, 6.698, 12.659, 10.047) -> (10.784+6.698+12.659+10.047)=40.188 -> 40.188/4=10.047\n        hour08: (8.306, 6.564, 8.172, 8.239) -> (8.306+6.564+8.172+8.239)=31.281 -> 31.281/4=7.82025 -> 7.820\n        hour09: (7.234, 6.631, 6.966, 6.899) -> (7.234+6.631+6.966+6.899)=27.73 -> 27.73/4=6.9325 -> 6.933\n        hour10: (8.172, 7.837, 7.167, 8.506) -> (8.172+7.837+7.167+8.506)=31.682 -> 31.682/4=7.9205 -> 7.921\n        hour11: (8.172, 7.703, 7.569, 8.908) -> (8.172+7.703+7.569+8.908)=32.352 -> 32.352/4=8.088\n        hour12: (6.631, 5.827, 5.693, 6.765) -> (6.631+5.827+5.693+6.765)=24.916 -> 24.916/4=6.229\n        hour13: (6.966, 5.827, 6.430, 7.368) -> (6.966+5.827+6.430+7.368)=26.591 -> 26.591/4=6.64775 -> 6.648\n        hour14: (7.100, 6.229, 7.033, 5.961) -> (7.100+6.229+7.033+5.961)=26.323 -> 26.323/4=6.58075 -> 6.581\n        hour15: (6.564, 7.301, 6.631, 6.832) -> (6.564+7.301+6.631+6.832)=27.328 -> 27.328/4=6.832\n        hour16: (6.095, 7.100, 6.296, 6.564) -> (6.095+7.100+6.296+6.564)=26.055 -> 26.055/4=6.51375 -> 6.514\n        hour17: (7.971, 8.372, 6.966, 7.435) -> (7.971+8.372+6.966+7.435)=30.744 -> 30.744/4=7.686\n        hour18: (7.167, 6.832, 6.430, 6.363) -> (7.167+6.832+6.430+6.363)=26.792 -> 26.792/4=6.698\n        hour19: (7.368, 7.033, 6.564, 6.497) -> (7.368+7.033+6.564+6.497)=27.462 -> 27.462/4=6.8655 -> 6.866\n        hour20: (6.296, 6.095, 6.363, 5.961) -> (6.296+6.095+6.363+5.961)=24.715 -> 24.715/4=6.17875 -> 6.179\n        hour21: (5.894, 5.559, 5.760, 5.425) -> (5.894+5.559+5.760+5.425)=22.638 -> 22.638/4=5.6595 -> 5.660\n        hour22: (5.090, 6.430, 4.823, 7.904) -> (5.090+6.430+4.823+7.904)=24.247 -> 24.247/4=6.06175 -> 6.062\n        hour23: (8.038, 8.707, 7.569, 9.310) -> (8.038+8.707+7.569+9.310)=33.624 -> 33.624/4=8.406\n\n 26.
