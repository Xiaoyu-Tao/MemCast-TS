        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to  Steps:\n  1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values.\n     However, the provided 96 points are complete. So we assume the given 96 points are without missing values for modeling.\n\n  2. We are to forecast 96 points ahead.\n\n  3. We can use a time series model. Since the data is hourly and we might expect daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n  4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n  5. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24 periods per day). Since we have 4 days of data, we can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n  6. We must be cautious: the data might have missing values in the future? But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the problem says: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". \n     However, the provided 96 points do not have missing values. So we interpret that the future 96 points we are to forecast might have missing values? \n     But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must provide 96 points without missing values.\n\n  7. Therefore, we will forecast 96 points without any missing values.\n\n  8. We choose a model: We'll use SARIMA because it can handle seasonality and we have a fixed seasonal period (24).\n\n  9. Steps for SARIMA:\n      - We need to set (p,d,q) for non-seasonal part and (P,D,Q,m) for seasonal part with m=24.\n      - We have limited data (only 4 days) so we cannot use a very complex model.\n\n 10. We can do:\n      - First, check for stationarity. We might need to take differences (both regular and seasonal).\n      - We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters? But we are not allowed to run code? We are an expert and must reason.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: We note that the data has a daily pattern. We can use a seasonal naive approach? But that would just repeat the last day? \n      However, the problem asks for a forecast and we are an expert so we should use a proper model.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a model with:\n      - Non-seasonal: We see some short-term correlation. We can try AR(1) or MA(1). \n      - Seasonal: We might set a seasonal AR or MA term of order 1.\n\n 13. But without running code, we have to make an educated guess? Actually, the problem expects us to generate the forecast without the ability to run code? \n      That is not practical. However, we are to simulate an expert.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? That is, for hour 00:00, we take the average of the 00:00 of the past 4 days and use that for the next 00:00, and so on.\n\n 15. But note: the data shows a pattern that is not exactly repeating. Also, we have only 4 days, so we can do:\n\n      Let the historical data be:\n        Day1: 2016-10-25 -> values for 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00\n        Day2: 2016-10-26\n        Day3: 2016-10-27\n        Day4: 2016-10-28\n\n      Then for the next day (2016-10-29) at hour h (where h from 00:00 to 23:00), we can compute:\n        forecast = (value of Day1 at h + Day2 at h + Day3 at h + Day4 at h) / 4\n\n      Then for 2016-10-30, we can use the same values? But that would be the same as 2016-10-29? \n      Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last 4 days for each day in the forecast.\n\n      So for the next 96 hours (4 days), we would have:\n        Day1 (2016-10-29): [avg of 4 days at 00:00, avg at 01:00, ... avg at 23:00]\n        Day2 (2016-10-30): same as Day1? \n        But that would be constant per hour over the 4 forecasted days? \n\n      That doesn't account for any trend. However, we don't have enough data to see a trend? \n\n 16. Another idea: use the last day (2016-10-28) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences from the same hour in the previous days? \n\n 17. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without running code, we choose a simple method: \n      We will use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days for each hour in the forecast. This will give a daily pattern that repeats.\n\n      Steps:\n        For each hour h in [0,23]:\n            Let v1 = value at h on 2016-10-25\n            v2 = value at h on 2016-10-26\n            v3 = value at h on 2016-10-27\n            v4 = value at h on 2016-10-28\n            avg_h = (v1+v2+v3+v4)/4\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n            Day1 (2016-10-29): [avg_00, avg_01, ... avg_23]\n            Day2 (2016-10-30): [avg_00, avg_01, ... avg_23]\n            Day3 (2016-10-31): [avg_00, avg_01, ... avg_23]\n            Day4 (2016-11-01): [avg_00, avg_01, ... avg_23]\n\n 18. But note: the data ends at 2016-10-28 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n        2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00.\n\n 19. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the 4 days.\n\n      Example for hour 00:00:\n        2016-10-25 00:00:00: 2.487\n        2016-10-26 00:00:00: 3.127\n        2016-10-27 00:00:00: 3.198\n        2016-10-28 00:00:00: 3.802\n        avg_00 = (2.487+3.127+3.198+3.802)/4 = 12.614/4 = 3.1535\n\n      Similarly for hour 01:00:\n        2016-10-25 01:00:00: 2.949\n        2016-10-26 01:00:00: 1.919\n        2016-10-27 01:00:00: 3.944\n        2016-10-28 01:00:00: 3.909\n        avg_01 = (2.949+1.919+3.944+3.909)/4 = 12.721/4 = 3.18025\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 20. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n 22. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are creating a forecast without missing values. So we are providing a complete forecast.\n\n 23. We must note: this method ignores any trend and any other patterns. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 24. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: (2.487 + 3.127 + 3.198 + 3.802) / 4 = 12.614 / 4 = 3.1535\n      Hour 1: (2.949 + 1.919 + 3.944 + 3.909) / 4 = 12.721 / 4 = 3.18025\n      Hour 2: (2.701 + 2.843 + 4.442 + 2.630) / 4 = 12.616 / 4 = 3.154\n      Hour 3: (3.340 + 2.665 + 3.767 + 3.447) / 4 = 13.219 / 4 = 3.30475\n      Hour 4: (2.630 + 2.523 + 3.625 + 3.305) / 4 = 12.083 / 4 = 3.02075\n      Hour 5: (2.914 + 2.203 + 3.340 + 3.340) / 4 = 11.797 / 4 = 2.94925\n      Hour 6: (2.665 + 2.487 + 2.736 + 2.843) / 4 = 10.731 / 4 = 2.68275\n      Hour 7: (3.163 + 2.665 + 3.234 + 3.340) / 4 = 12.402 / 4 = 3.1005\n      Hour 8: (2.310 + 2.736 + 3.269 + 2.559) / 4 = 10.874 / 4 = 2.7185\n      Hour 9: (2.168 + 2.772 + 2.701 + 1.990) / 4 = 9.631 / 4 = 2.40775\n      Hour 10: (1.990 + 2.274 + 3.127 + 2.025) / 4 = 9.416 / 4 = 2.354\n      Hour 11: (1.706 + 2.665 + 2.914 + 1.883) / 4 = 9.168 / 4 = 2.292\n      Hour 12: (1.564 + 1.919 + 1.635 + 1.635) / 4 = 6.753 / 4 = 1.68825\n      Hour 13: (1.599 + 2.061 + 2.843 + 1.919) / 4 = 8.422 / 4 = 2.1055\n      Hour 14: (2.274 + 1.883 + 3.020 + 2.665) / 4 = 9.842 / 4 = 2.4605\n      Hour 15: (2.416 + 1.635 + 2.878 + 1.883) / 4 = 8.812 / 4 = 2.203\n      Hour 16: (2.487 + 2.097 + 2.203 + 2.168) / 4 = 8.955 / 4 = 2.23875\n      Hour 17: (1.883 + 2.025 + 2.345 + 1.599) / 4 = 7.852 / 4 = 1.963\n      Hour 18: (1.421 + 1.599 + 1.777 + 1.528) / 4 = 6.325 / 4 = 1.58125\n      Hour 19: (1.102 + 1.599 + 1.812 + 0.924) / 4 = 5.437 / 4 = 1.35925\n      Hour 20: (1.208 + 1.208 + 1.315 + 0.888) / 4 = 4.619 / 4 = 1.15475\n      Hour 21: (0.249 + 1.102 + 1.066 + 0.497) / 4 = 2.914 / 4 = 0.7285\n      Hour 22: (1.599 + 1.883 + 1.635 + 1.599) / 4 = 6.716 / 4 = 1.679\n      Hour 23: (2.701 + 2.630 + 2.559 + 1.954) / 4 = 9.844 / 4 = 2.461\n\n 25. Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n      Day1: 2016-10-29\n        00:00:00 -> 3.1535\n        01:00:00 -> 3.18025\n        02:00:00 -> 3.154\n        03:00:00 -> 3.30475\n        04:00:00 -> 3.02075\n        05:00:00 -> 2.94925\n        06:00:00 -> 2.68275\n        07:00:00 -> 3.1005\n        08:00:00 -> 2.7185\n        09:00:00 -> 2.40775\n        10:00:00 -> 2.354\n        11:00:00 -> 2.292\n        12:00:00 -> 1.68825\n        13:00:00 -> 2.1055\n        14:00:00 -> 2.4605\n        15:00:00 -> 2.203\n        16:00:00 -> 2.23875\n        17:00:00 -> 1.963\n        18:00:00 -> 1.58125\n        19:00:00 -> 1.35925\n        20:00:00 -> 1.15475\n        21:00:00 -> 0.7285\n        22:00:00 -> 1.679\n        23:00:00 -> 2.461\n\n      Day2: 2016-10-30: same 24 values as above.\n      Day3: 2016-10-31: same.\n      Day4: 2016-11-01: same.\n\n 26. But note: the problem says the data is recorded either hourly or every 15 minutes. In this case, the given data is hourly. So we output hourly.\n\n 27. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MULL'. The date must be in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 28. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-10-29 00:00:00\n      Then 2016-10-29 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-01 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n 30. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 31. However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output all 96 lines.\n\n 32. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. So we round our averages to 3 decimals.\n\n 33. Let's round:\n\n        Hour0: 3.1535 -> 3.154\n        Hour1: 3.18025 -> 3.180\n        Hour2: 3.154 -> 3.154\n        Hour3: 3.30475 -> 3.305\n        Hour4: 3.02075 -> 3.021\n        Hour5: 2.94925 -> 2.949\n        Hour6: 2.68275 -> 2.683\n        Hour7: 3.1005 -> 3.101\n        Hour8: 2.7185 -> 2.718\n        Hour9: 2.40775 -> 2.408\n        Hour10: 2.354 -> 2.354\n        Hour11: 2.292 -> 2.292\n        Hour12: 1.68825 -> 1.688\n        Hour13: 2.1055 -> 2.106\n        Hour14: 2.4605 -> 2.461\n        Hour15: 2.203 -> 2.203\n        Hour16: 2.23875 -> 2.239\n        Hour17: 1.963 -> 1.963\n        Hour18: 1.58125 -> 1.581\n        Hour19: 1.35925 -> 1.359\n        Hour20: 1.15475 -> 1.155\n        Hour21: 0.7285 -> 0.728\n        Hour22: 1.679 -> 1.679 (but note: 1.679 is already 3 decimals? Actually, 1.6790 -> 1.679)\n        Hour23: 2.461 -> 2.461\n\n 34. Now we write the data.\n\n 35. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are providing a complete forecast. So we are good.\n\n 36. We output in the required format.\n\n 37. However, note: the input data had a decreasing trend? But we are using a constant pattern. This is a limitation.\n\n 38. Given the constraints, we proceed.\n\n 39. We write the next 96 records:\n\n        date                 MULL\n        2016-10-29 00:00:00 3.154\n        2016-10-29 01:00:00 3.180\n        2016-10-29 02:00:00 3.154\n        2016-10-29 03:00:00 3.305\n        2016-10-29 04:00:00 3.021\n        2016-10-29 05:00:00 2.949\n        2016-10-29 06:00:00 2.683\n        2016-10-29 07:00:00 3.101\n        2016-10-29 08:00:00 2.718\n        2016-10-29 09:00:00 2.408\n        2016-10-29 10:00:00 2.354\n        2016-10-29 11:00:00 2.292\n        2016-10-29 12:00:00 1.688\n        2016-10-29 13:00:00 2.106\n        2016-10-29 14:00:00 2.461\n        2016-10-29 15:00:00 2.203\n        2016-10-29 16:00:00 2.239\n        2016-10-29 17:00:00 1.963\n        2016-10-29 18:00:00 1.581\n        2016-10-29 19:00:00 1.359\n        2016-10-29 20:00:00 1.155\n        2016-10-29 21:00:00 0.728\n        2016-10-29 22:00:00 1.679\n        2016-10-29 23:00:00 2.461\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 hours for the next 3 days.\n\n 40. We note: the dates must be consecutive. So:\n\n        2016-10-29 23:00:00 -> next is 2016-10-30 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, etc.\n\n 41. We generate the dates programmatically in the output.\n\n 42. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 43. We output 96 lines.\n\n 44. We note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\" meaning the next 96 time points.\n\n 45. We are ready.\n",
