        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we assume the model can handle any missing values if present, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use models such as:\n    - ARIMA (or SARIMA for seasonality)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters)\n    - Prophet by Facebook\n    - LSTM or other deep learning models (but this might be overkill and we don't have a lot of data)\n\n 3. Considering the data length (only 96 points) and the frequency (hourly), we might observe daily seasonality (24 hours). \n    Therefore, a seasonal model is appropriate.\n\n 4. We'll use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) because it can capture both non-seasonal and seasonal patterns.\n\n 5. Steps for SARIMA:\n    a. Check stationarity and seasonality.\n    b. Determine the orders (p,d,q) and seasonal orders (P,D,Q,s) where s=24 for daily seasonality in hourly data.\n\n 6. However, note that we have only 4 days of data (96 hours). This is a very short time for a seasonal model with s=24. \n    We might not have enough seasonal cycles to fit a robust seasonal model.\n\n 7. Alternative: Use a non-seasonal model and hope that the short-term patterns are captured. But the data does show some daily pattern (e.g., values during the day vs night).\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we might use a simpler model. Let's try to decompose the series to see if there is a clear seasonality.\n\n 9. Since we are required to provide the forecast and the data is small, we can use a model that automatically handles seasonality, such as the Seasonal Naive method, \n    but that might not be sophisticated enough.\n\n10. Another option: Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). The `statsmodels` library has an implementation.\n\n11. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, which can handle additive or multiplicative seasonality. \n    Given the data, we try additive seasonality because the variation seems constant.\n\n12. Steps for ExponentialSmoothing:\n    - Fit the model on the 96 points with seasonal period=24 and additive seasonality.\n    - Forecast next 96 steps.\n\n13. However, note: the data has negative values, so multiplicative seasonality might not be appropriate (since multiplicative assumes positive data). \n    We'll use additive.\n\n14. Implementation in code (but note: we are to output the forecast without code in the answer). We simulate the process.\n\n15. But since we are an AI, we can simulate the model fitting and forecasting.\n\n16. Alternatively, we can use an automated method like auto_arima to find the best parameters for SARIMA, but again we have limited data.\n\n17. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we will use the Exponential Smoothing model (Holt-Winters) with additive trend and additive seasonality.\n\n18. We'll use `statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing` and fit on the provided data.\n\n19. However, note: the data has 96 points and we are forecasting 96 points ahead. The model might not be very accurate for such a long horizon, but we have to do it.\n\n20. Since we cannot run actual code here, we will describe the process and then provide a simulated forecast. But the problem requires the complete data.\n\n21. Actually, we are expected to provide the forecasted values. We must generate 96 values.\n\n22. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by:\n\n    a. Calculating the daily pattern (seasonal indices) from the 4 days of data.\n    b. Taking the average of the same hour across the 4 days to get 24 seasonal indices.\n    c. Then, we remove the seasonal effect from the data to get the trend-cycle.\n    d. For the trend, we can use a moving average (e.g., 24-hour moving average) to smooth and then project the last few points into the future (e.g., linear extrapolation for the trend over the next 4 days).\n    e. Then combine: forecast = trend_forecast + seasonal_index for the corresponding hour.\n\n23. This is a simple decomposition method.\n\n24. Steps in detail:\n\n    Step 1: Compute the seasonal indices (hour of the day effects) for 24 hours.\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): average of [2016-12-12 00:00:00, 2016-12-13 00:00:00, 2016-12-14 00:00:00, 2016-12-15 00:00:00]\n        Similarly for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n    Step 2: The seasonal indices are then centered (so that the average of the indices over a cycle is 0). \n\n    Step 3: Deseasonalize the series: original series minus the seasonal index for that hour.\n\n    Step 4: On the deseasonalized series, we fit a trend. Since we have only 4 days, we can use a linear trend? Or a moving average to smooth and then extrapolate.\n\n        We can use a centered moving average of window 24 to get the trend component.\n\n        But note: at the ends we lose some points. We can use a simple linear regression on the deseasonalized series to get the trend.\n\n    Step 5: Forecast the trend for the next 96 hours. We can fit a linear model: y = a + b*t, where t is the time index (0 to 95). Then for t=96 to 191, we get the trend forecast.\n\n    Step 6: Add back the seasonal indices for the corresponding hours in the next 4 days.\n\n25. However, note: the next 96 hours are the next 4 days, so the seasonal pattern will repeat.\n\n26. Let's do the calculation:\n\n    First, we compute the seasonal indices:\n\n        hour0: (0.391 + (-0.355) + (-0.071) + 0.391) / 4 = (0.391 -0.355 -0.071+0.391)/4 = (0.356)/4 = 0.089\n        ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n    But note: we have to center the seasonal indices so that the average over 24 hours is 0.\n\n    However, given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the forecast, we might skip the centering? \n    Actually, we can compute the average of the 24 indices and subtract that average from each index to center.\n\n27. Alternatively, we can use the method of averages: the seasonal indices are computed as the average for that hour minus the overall average.\n\n    But we don't have the overall average? We can compute the overall average of the entire 96 points.\n\n    Overall average = (sum of all 96 points) / 96.\n\n    Then, for hour i, the seasonal index = (average of hour i) - overall average.\n\n28. This is a bit involved. We are going to simulate the process and then provide the forecast.\n\n29. However, we are not output the code but the data. So we have to compute the forecast.\n\n30. Given the time and the fact that we are to provide the data, we will use a simpler method: \n\n    We use the average of the last 24 hours as the base for the next day? But that doesn't account for trend.\n\n31. Another simple method: Seasonal Naive. We use the value from the same hour in the last day (or the same hour in the same day of the week? but we don't have day of week). \n    But we only have 4 days, and they are consecutive. We can use the last day (2016-12-15) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n    However, the problem says to forecast 96 hours, so 4 days. We can repeat the last day's pattern 4 times? \n\n    But that ignores any trend.\n\n32. We can adjust for a linear trend over the 4 days. We compute the average of each day:\n\n        Day1 (2016-12-12): average of 24 hours\n        Day2: average\n        Day3: average\n        Day4: average\n\n    Then fit a linear trend on these 4 daily averages. Then for the next 4 days, we project the daily average.\n\n    Then for each hour in the next day, we take the last day's (2016-12-15) value at that hour and adjust by the projected daily average change.\n\n    Specifically:\n\n        Let d1, d2, d3, d4 be the daily averages for the 4 days.\n        We fit a line: d_t = a + b * t, for t=0,1,2,3.\n\n        Then for t=4 (next day), d5 = a + b*4\n        Similarly, d6 = a+b*5, d7=a+b*6, d8=a+b*7.\n\n        Then for hour i in the next day (day5), we set:\n            value = (value of hour i on day4) + (d5 - d4)\n\n        Similarly for day6: value = (value of hour i on day4) + (d6 - d4)\n        But this assumes that the intraday pattern remains the same and only the level shifts by the change in daily average.\n\n    Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        For day5, hour i: value = (value of hour i on day4) * (d5 / d4)   [if multiplicative] but we have negative values so additive is better.\n\n        So additive: value = (value of hour i on day4) + (d5 - d4)\n\n        Then for day6, hour i: value = (value of hour i on day4) + (d6 - d4)\n\n        But note: this uses day4 as the base and then adds the difference for the entire day. However, the daily average of the new day5 would then be d4 + (d5-d4) = d5, which is what we want.\n\n33. Steps:\n\n    a. Compute daily averages for the 4 days:\n\n        day1: 2016-12-12: average1 = ?\n        day2: 2016-12-13: average2 = ?\n        day3: 2016-12-14: average3 = ?\n        day4: 2016-12-15: average4 = ?\n\n    b. Fit a linear regression on [0: average1, 1: average2, 2: average3, 3: average4] to get a and b.\n\n    c. Then:\n\n        day5 average = a + b*4\n        day6 average = a + b*5\n        day7 average = a + b*6\n        day8 average = a + b*7\n\n    d. For each hour i (0 to 23) in the next 4 days:\n\n        day5, hour i: value = (day4, hour i) + (day5_avg - day4_avg)\n        day6, hour i: value = (day4, hour i) + (day6_avg - day4_avg)\n        day7, hour i: value = (day4, hour i) + (day7_avg - day4_avg)\n        day8, hour i: value = (day4, hour i) + (day8_avg - day4_avg)\n\n    But note: the base is day4. This method assumes that the shape of the day remains the same and only the level shifts.\n\n34. However, we have to consider that the daily pattern might change? But we don't have more data.\n\n35. Let's compute the daily averages:\n\n    Day1 (2016-12-12): \n        sum = 0.391 -0.178 +0.036 -0.036 +0.284 +0.178 +0.533 -0.462 -1.350 -2.061 -1.315 -0.924 -2.487 -0.817 -0.711 -0.817 -0.924 -1.492 -1.706 -1.848 -1.635 -1.919 -0.462 -1.173\n        = -17.186\n        average1 = -17.186 / 24 = -0.716083333\n\n    Day2 (2016-12-13):\n        sum = -0.355 -1.208 -0.853 -0.853 -0.817 -0.817 -1.848 -2.025 -1.208 -1.386 -0.782 -0.675 -1.599 -1.386 -1.315 -1.741 -2.274 -1.919 -2.239 -2.239 -2.203 -1.954 -1.599 -0.711\n        = -33.118\n        average2 = -33.118 / 24 = -1.379916667\n\n    Day3 (2016-12-14):\n        sum = -0.071 +0.782 +0.426 +0.675 +0.284 +0.640 +0.107 +0.888 -0.178 -0.853 +0.000 -0.995 -1.670 -1.492 -0.462 -1.173 -1.208 -1.670 -1.670 -1.350 -1.777 -1.599 -1.031 -0.746\n        = -13.225\n        average3 = -13.225 / 24 = -0.551041667\n\n    Day4 (2016-12-15):\n        sum = 0.391 +1.173 +0.675 +0.213 +0.355 +0.782 +0.000 -0.640 -0.320 -0.071 -0.107 -0.746 -2.310 -1.386 -1.173 -1.457 -1.706 -1.883 -1.883 -1.777 -1.421 -3.020 -1.208 -1.031\n        = -16.780\n        average4 = -16.780 / 24 = -0.699166667\n\n    Now, we have:\n        t0 (day1): -0.716083333\n        t1 (day2): -1.379916667\n        t2 (day3): -0.551041667\n        t3 (day4): -0.699166667\n\n    We fit a linear regression: y = a + b*t\n\n        t = [0,1,2,3]\n        y = [-0.716083333, -1.379916667, -0.551041667, -0.699166667]\n\n    We can compute:\n\n        n = 4\n        sum_t = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n        sum_y = -0.716083333 -1.379916667 -0.551041667 -0.699166667 = -3.346208334\n        sum_t2 = 0^2+1^2+2^2+3^2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n        sum_ty = 0*(-0.716083333 + 1*(-1.379916667) + 2*(-0.551041667) + 3*(-0.699166667)\n                = 0 -1.379916667 -1.102083334 -2.097500001 = -4.5795\n\n        b = (n * sum_ty - sum_t * sum_y) / (n * sum_t2 - (sum_t)^2)\n          = (4*(-4.5795) - 6*(-3.346208334)) / (4*14 - 6^2)\n          = (-18.318 + 20.077250004) / (56 - 36)\n          = (1.759250004) / 20\n          = 0.0879625002\n\n        a = (sum_y - b * sum_t) / n\n          = (-3.346208334 - 0.0879625002*6) / 4\n          = (-3.346208334 - 0.5277750012) / 4\n          = (-3.8739833352) / 4\n          = -0.9684958338\n\n    Then for the next days:\n\n        day5 (t=4): y5 = a + b*4 = -0.9684958338 + 0.0879625002*4 = -0.9684958338 + 0.3518500008 = -0.616645833\n        day6 (t=5): y6 = a + b*5 = -0.9684958338 + 0.0879625002*5 = -0.9684958338 + 0.439812501 = -0.5286833328\n        day7 (t=6): y7 = a + b*6 = -0.9684958338 + 0.5277750012 = -0.4407208326\n        day8 (t=7): y8 = a + b*7 = -0.9684958338 + 0.6156875014 = -0.3528083324\n\n    Now, the differences from day4 (which had average = -0.699166667):\n\n        day5: diff5 = y5 - (-0.699166667) = -0.616645833 + 0.699166667 = 0.082520834\n        day6: diff6 = y6 - (-0.699166667) = -0.5286833328 + 0.699166667 = 0.1704833342\n        day7: diff7 = y7 - (-0.699166667) = -0.4407208326 + 0.699166667 = 0.2584458344\n        day8: diff8 = y8 - (-0.699166667) = -0.3528083324 + 0.699166667 = 0.3463583346\n\n36. Now, we take the last day (2016-12-15) as the base pattern:\n\n        hour0: 0.391\n        hour1: 1.173\n        hour2: 0.675\n        hour3: 0.213\n        hour4: 0.355\n        hour5: 0.782\n        hour6: 0.000\n        hour7: -0.640\n        hour8: -0.320\n        hour9: -0.071\n        hour10: -0.107\n        hour11: -0.746\n        hour12: -2.310\n        hour13: -1.386\n        hour14: -1.173\n        hour15: -1.457\n        hour16: -1.706\n        hour17: -1.883\n        hour18: -1.883\n        hour19: -1.777\n        hour20: -1.421\n        hour21: -3.020\n        hour22: -1.208\n        hour23: -1.031\n\n    Then for the next 4 days:\n\n        Day5 (2016-12-16): each hour = base_hour + diff5\n        Day6 (2016-12-17): each hour = base_hour + diff6\n        Day7 (2016-12-18): each hour = base_hour + diff7\n        Day8 (2016-12-19): each hour = base_hour + diff8\n\n37. Example for day5, hour0: 0.391 + 0.082520834 = 0.473520834\n    hour1: 1.173 + 0.082520834 = 1.255520834\n    ... and so on.\n\n38. We have to generate 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) in chronological order.\n\n39. But note: the dates must be generated from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n40. We'll generate the dates and the corresponding MULL values.\n\n41. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are forecasting without gaps. We are to provide the next 96 consecutive hours.\n\n42. We output the data in the same format: two columns: date and MULL.\n\n43. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n44. Let's do the calculation for the first day of forecast (2016-12-16) as an example:\n\n    base_hour (from 00:00 to 23:00) of 2016-12-15, plus 0.0825 (rounded to 0.083? but we'll keep more precision and then round at the end).\n\n    We'll compute:\n\n        day5: base + 0.082520834\n        day6: base + 0.1704833342\n        day7: base + 0.2584458344\n        day8: base + 0.3463583346\n\n45. We must be cautious: the base day (2016-12-15) has 24 values. We'll add the same day5_diff to each of these 24 to form the first day of forecast.\n\n46. Then the next day (2016-12-17) we add day6_diff to the same base day 24 values.\n\n47. And so on.\n\n48. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2016-12-16 00:00:00\n    Then 2016-12-16 01:00:00 ... up to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n49. We write the data in the required format.\n\n50. But note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the given data is hourly. So we are forecasting hourly.\n\n51. We output:\n\n        date                 MULL\n        2016-12-16 00:00:00 0.391 + 0.082520834 = 0.473520834 -> 0.474\n        ... \n\n52. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n53. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places, so we round to 3.\n\n54. Let's compute the entire 96 values.\n\n    We have the base day (2016-12-15) as a list:\n\n        base = [0.391, 1.173, 0.675, 0.213, 0.355, 0.782, 0.000, -0.640, -0.320, -0.071, -0.107, -0.746, -2.310, -1.386, -1.173, -1.457, -1.706, -1.883, -1.883, -1.777, -1.421, -3.020, -1.208, -1.031]\n\n    Then:\n\n        day5: [x + 0.082520834 for x in base]\n        day6: [x + 0.1704833342 for x in base]\n        day7: [x + 0.2584458344 for x in base]\n        day8: [x + 0.3463583346 for x in base]\n\n55. We combine these 4 lists.\n\n56. We generate the dates:\n\n        day5: 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-16 23:00:00\n        day6: 2016-12-17 00:00:00 to 2016-12-17 23:00:00\n        day7: 2016-12-18 00:00:00 to 2016-12-18 23:00:00\n        day8: 2016-12-19 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00\n\n57. Now, we write the data.\n\n58. We must be cautious: the base day (2016-12-15) is a Thursday? But we don't have weekday information. We are just doing a linear trend in daily averages.\n\n59. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-16 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-12-16 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-12-19 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n60. We compute the values by rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n61. Let's do the first few:\n\n    Day5 (2016-12-16):\n\n        00:00: 0.391 + 0.082520834 = 0.473520834 -> 0.474\n        01:00: 1.173 + 0.082520834 = 1.255520834 -> 1.256\n        02:00: 0.675 + 0.082520834 = 0.757520834 -> 0.758\n        03:00: 0.213 + 0.082520834 = 0.295520834 -> 0.296\n        04:00: 0.355 + 0.082520834 = 0.437520834 -> 0.438\n        05:00: 0.782 + 0.082520834 = 0.864520834 -> 0.865\n        06:00: 0.000 + 0.082520834 = 0.082520834 -> 0.083\n        07:00: -0.640 + 0.082520834 = -0.557479166 -> -0.557\n        08:00: -0.320 + 0.082520834 = -0.237479166 -> -0.237\n        09:00: -0.071 + 0.082520834 = 0.011520834 -> 0.012\n        10:00: -0.107 + 0.082520834 = -0.024479166 -> -0.024\n        11:00: -0.746 + 0.082520834 = -0.663479166 -> -0.663\n        12:00: -2.310 + 0.082520834 = -2.227479166 -> -2.227\n        13:00: -1.386 + 0.082520834 = -1.303479166 -> -1.303\n        14:00: -1.173 + 0.082520834 = -1.090479166 -> -1.090\n        15:00: -1.457 + 0.082520834 = -1.374479166 -> -1.374\n        16:00: -1.706 + 0.082520834 = -1.623479166 -> -1.623\n        17:00: -1.883 + 0.082520834 = -1.800479166 -> -1.800\n        18:00: -1.883 + 0.082520834 = -1.800479166 -> -1.800\n        19:00: -1.777 + 0.082520834 = -1.694479166 -> -1.694\n        20:00: -1.421 + 0.082520834 = -1.338479166 -> -1.338\n        21:00: -3.020 + 0.082520834 = -2.937479166 -> -2.937\n        22:00: -1.208 + 0.082520834 = -1.125479166 -> -1.125\n        23:00: -1.031 + 0.082520834 = -0.948479166 -> -0.948\n\n    Day6 (2016-12-17): add 0.1704833342\n\n        00:00: 0.391 + 0.1704833342 = 0.5614833342 -> 0.561\n        01:00: 1.173 + 0.1704833342 = 1.3434833342 -> 1.343\n        ... and so on.\n\n62. We'll generate the entire 96 values accordingly.\n\n63. However, note: the method is very simplistic and may not be accurate, but it is one way to handle the short data.\n\n64. We output the data in the answer block.\n\n65. We must be cautious: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are forecasting without any missing values.\n\n66. We generate the next 96 hours.\n\n67. We write the answer in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simulated forecast and in practice, one would use a more robust model. But given the constraints, we proceed.\n\nLet's write the data for the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n",
