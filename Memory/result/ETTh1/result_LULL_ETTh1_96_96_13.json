        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-22 00:00:00 to 2016-08-25 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load drops during certain hours (like around 8-9 AM) and rises at night.\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data? But the given 96 points are complete. However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. \n    Since the provided data for the past 96 dates is complete, we have 96 consecutive hours without missing values), we can proceed to model the time series.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 steps (from 2016-08-26 00:00:00 to 2016-08-29 23:00:00).\n\n 4. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model. One common approach for hourly data with daily seasonality is to use a seasonal naive method, \n    but we can also consider exponential smoothing or even a simple average of the last few days.\n\n 5. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points we don't have any. For forecasting, we assume the pattern of the last 4 days will repeat.\n\n 6. Since the data is only 4 days, we can take the average of each hour across the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        - We have 4 days, each with 24 hours -> 4 observations per hour (e.g., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00).\n        - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we simply repeat the computed daily profile 4 times.\n\n 7. Why this be reasonable?\n    - The data shows a similar pattern each day: \n        * A drop around 8-9 AM (to about 0.82-0.94) \n        * Then a rise during the day, and then a drop again at night.\n\n 8. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n    We'll group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and compute the mean for each hour.\n\n 9. However, note that the data provided is exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can reshape the data into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean for each column (each hour).\n\n 10. But note: the data starts at 2016-08-22 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-08-25 23:00:00. So we have 4 full days.\n\n 11. Compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (1.614 + 0.975 + 1.066 + 1.584) / 4\n        hour1: (1.492 + 0.853 + 1.066 + 1.432) / 4\n        ... and so on.\n\n 12. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-08-26 to 2016-08-29) will be the same hourly average for each day.\n\n 13. However, note that the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" but in the provided past data we don't have any. \n     We are only using the provided 96 points to compute the averages.\n\n 14. Let's compute the averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the mean.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use pandas if we were coding, but since we are not, we do it manually.\n\n 16. But note: the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 17. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     hour0: [1.614, 0.975, 1.066, 1.584] -> average = (1.614+0.975+1.066+1.584)/4 = 5.239/4 = 1.30975\n     hour1: [1.492, 0.853, 1.066, 1.432] -> (1.492+0.853+1.066+1.432)=4.843/4=1.21075\n     hour2: [1.462, 0.883, 0.853, 1.371] -> (1.462+0.883+0.853+1.371)=4.569/4=1.14225\n     hour3: [1.553, 0.853, 0.944, 1.340] -> (1.553+0.853+0.944+1.340)=4.69/4=1.1725\n     hour4: [1.584, 0.822, 0.944, 1.249] -> (1.584+0.822+0.944+1.249)=4.599/4=1.14975\n     hour5: [1.340, 0.731, 0.944, 1.310] -> (1.340+0.731+0.944+1.310)=4.325/4=1.08125\n     hour6: [1.401, 0.822, 0.822, 1.218] -> (1.401+0.822+0.822+1.218)=4.263/4=1.06575\n     hour7: [1.584, 0.975, 1.005, 1.432] -> (1.584+0.975+1.005+1.432)=4.996/4=1.249\n     hour8: [0.822, 1.005, 1.127, 0.944] -> (0.822+1.005+1.127+0.944)=3.898/4=0.9745\n     hour9: [0.822, 1.066, 1.066, 0.944] -> (0.822+1.066+1.066+0.944)=3.898/4=0.9745\n     hour10: [1.218, 1.097, 1.127, 1.066] -> (1.218+1.097+1.127+1.066)=4.508/4=1.127\n     hour11: [1.036, 1.036, 1.066, 1.066] -> (1.036+1.036+1.066+1.066)=4.204/4=1.051\n     hour12: [0.944, 1.279, 1.157, 1.005] -> (0.944+1.279+1.157+1.005)=4.385/4=1.09625\n     hour13: [1.005, 1.066, 1.127, 1.036] -> (1.005+1.066+1.127+1.036)=4.234/4=1.0585\n     hour14: [1.097, 1.036, 1.249, 1.249] -> (1.097+1.036+1.249+1.249)=4.631/4=1.15775\n     hour15: [1.005, 1.249, 1.127, 1.340] -> (1.005+1.249+1.127+1.340)=4.721/4=1.18025\n     hour16: [1.005, 1.188, 1.218, 1.249] -> (1.005+1.188+1.218+1.249)=4.66/4=1.165\n     hour17: [1.279, 1.157, 1.127, 1.097] -> (1.279+1.157+1.127+1.097)=4.66/4=1.165\n     hour18: [1.097, 1.066, 1.066, 1.157] -> (1.097+1.066+1.066+1.157)=4.386/4=1.0965\n     hour19: [1.097, 1.157, 1.249, 1.157] -> (1.097+1.157+1.249+1.157)=4.66/4=1.165\n     hour20: [1.097, 1.036, 1.157, 1.127] -> (1.097+1.036+1.157+1.127)=4.417/4=1.10425\n     hour21: [0.975, 1.249, 1.340, 1.188] -> (0.975+1.249+1.340+1.188)=4.752/4=1.188\n     hour22: [1.036, 1.188, 1.097, 1.097] -> (1.036+1.188+1.097+1.097)=4.418/4=1.1045\n     hour23: [0.975, 1.066, 1.005, 1.249] -> (0.975+1.066+1.005+1.249)=4.295/4=1.07375\n\n 18. Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-26 00:00:00 to 2016-08-29 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-08-26): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day2 (2016-08-27): same as above\n        Day3 (2016-08-28): same\n        Day4:2016-08-29: same\n\n 19. We must generate the numbers with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 20. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        date: starting from 2016-08-26 00:00:00, then 2016-08-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-08-29 23:00:00.\n\n 21. We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n        hour0: 1.310\n        hour1: 1.211\n        hour2: 1.142\n        hour3: 1.173\n        hour4: 1.150\n        hour5: 1.081\n        hour6: 1.066\n        hour7: 1.249\n        hour8: 0.975\n        hour9: 0.975\n        hour10: 1.127\n        hour11: 1.051\n        hour12: 1.096\n        hour13: 1.059\n        hour14: 1.158\n        hour15: 1.180\n        hour16: 1.165\n        hour17: 1.165\n        hour18: 1.097\n        hour19: 1.165\n        hour20: 1.104\n        hour21: 1.188\n        hour22: 1.105\n        hour23: 1.074\n\n 22. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 23. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-26 00:00:00 -> 1.310\n               2016-08-26 01:00:00 -> 1.211\n               ... until 2016-08-26 23:00:00 -> 1.074\n\n        Then 2016-08-27 00:00:00 -> 1.310\n        ... and so on.\n\n 24. We must be cautious: the last date in the input is 2016-08-25 23:00:00, so the next date is 2016-08-26 00:00:00.\n\n 25. We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n 26. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-26 00:00:00 1.310\n2016-08-26 01:00:00 1.211\n... \n2016-08-29 23:00:00 1.074\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 27. However, note that the input data had a date format without quotes and with a space between date and time.\n\n 28. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Day 5: 2016-08-26 (from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00)\n        Day 6: 2016-08-27\n        Day 7: 2016-08-28\n        Day 8: 2016-08-29\n\n 29. We must be cautious: August has 31 days, so 26,27,28,29 are valid.\n\n 30. Let's write the forecast for the next 96 hours.\n\n 31. We note that the average method is simple and might not capture trends, but with only 4 days of data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 32. If we had more data, we could use more sophisticated methods, but the problem only gives 4 days.\n\n 33. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 34. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 35. Let's code the output:\n\n        We have the 24 averages in a list: \n            avg = [1.310, 1.211, 1.142, 1.173, 1.150, 1.081, 1.066, 1.249, 0.975, 0.975, 1.127, 1.051, \n                   1.096, 1.059, 1.158, 1.180, 1.165, 1.165, 1.097, 1.165, 1.104, 1.188, 1.105, 1.074]\n\n        Then for day in [26,27,28,29]:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2016-08-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n        But note: the day must be two digits: 36. We'll generate:\n\n        day 26: from 0 to 23 -> 2016-08-26 00:00:00 to 2016-08-26 23:00:00\n        day 27: 2016-08-27 00:00:00 to 2016-08-27 23:00:00\n        day 28: 2016-08-28 00:00:00 to 2016-08-28 23:00:00\n        day 29: 2016-08-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-29 23:00:00\n\n 37. We must be cautious: the hour must be zero-padded to 2 digits.\n\n 38. Now, we write the data.\n\n 39. However, note: the input data had the hour as 00,01,...,23.\n\n 40. We'll generate the 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 41. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-08-26 00:00:00 1.310\n        2016-08-26 01:00:00 1.211\n        2016-08-26 02:00:00 1.142\n        2016-08-26 03:00:00 1.173\n        2016-08-26 04:00:00 1.150\n        2016-08-26 05:00:00 1.081\n        2016-08-26 06:00:00 1.066\n        2016-08-26 07:00:00 1.249\n        2016-08-26 08:00:00 0.975\n        2016-08-26 09:00:00 0.975\n        2016-08-26 10:00:00 1.127\n        2016-08-26 11:00:00 1.051\n        2016-08-26 12:00:00 1.096\n        2016-08-26 13:00:00 1.059\n        2016-08-26 14:00:00 1.158\n        2016-08-26 15:00:00 1.180\n        2016-08-26 16:00:00 1.165\n        2016-08-26 17:00:00 1.165\n        2016-08-26 18:00:00 1.097\n        2016-08-26 19:00:00 1.165\n        2016-08-26 20:00:00 1.104\n        2016-08-26 21:00:00 1.188\n        2016-08-26 22:00:00 1.105\n        2016-08-26 23:00:00 1.074\n\n        Then repeat the same for 27, 28, 29.\n\n 42. We note: the average for each hour is the same for each day.\n\n 43. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 44. We must be cautious: the rounding we did might have introduced a slight change. We used the exact average rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 45. Let's recalc one to check: hour0: (1.614+0.975+1.066+1.584)=5.239 -> 5.239/4=1.30975 -> rounded to 3 decimals is 1.310.\n\n 46. So we are good.\n\n 47. Now, we write the answer in the required markdown code block.\n\n 48. We must not omit any content.\n\n 49. We generate the 96 lines.\n\n 50. We'll write a loop for the 4 days and 24 hours.\n\n 51. The dates: \n        Day 26: 2016-08-26\n        Day 27: 2016-08-27\n        Day 28: 2016-08-28\n        Day 29: 2016-08-29\n\n 52. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-26 00:00:00 1.310\n2016-08-26 01:00:00 1.211\n... (all 96 lines)\n2016-08-29 23:00:00 1.074\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 53. We'll generate the entire list.\n\n 54. We note: the hour in the time string must be two digits.\n\n 55. We'll create the list of averages:\n\n        averages = [\n            1.310, 1.211, 1.142, 1.173, 1.150, 1.081, 1.066, 1.249, \n            0.975, 0.975, 1.127, 1.051, 1.096, 1.059, 1.158, 1.180, \n            1.165, 1.165, 1.097, 1.165, 1.104, 1.188, 1.105, 1.074\n        ]\n\n 56. Then for each day_offset in [0,1,2,3] (for 26,27,28,29) and for each hour in 0..23, we output:\n\n        date = f\"2016-08-{26+day_offset} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n 57. But note: 26+0=26, 26+1=27, 26+2=28, 26+3=29 -> that's correct.\n\n 58. We write the code in our mind to generate the 96 lines.\n\n 59. We output the value as the average for that hour.\n\n 60. We must be cautious: the day in the date must be two digits? 26,27,28,29 are two digits.\n\n 61. We generate the string for each line: \n        f\"{date} {averages[hour]:.3f}\"\n\n 62.
