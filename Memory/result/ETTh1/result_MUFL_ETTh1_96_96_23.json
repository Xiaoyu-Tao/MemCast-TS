        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The data starts at 2016-10-01 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-10-04 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and shows a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality).\n 2. There might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing (all 96 are present).\n 3. We will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple seasons of 24 hours) and the data is relatively short, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a model like SARIMA, or even exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n - However, the data is short (only 4 days) so we must be cautious.\n\n Given the data, we observe:\n   - The load is higher during the night (00:00 to early morning) and then drops during the day, with some peaks at certain hours.\n   - There is a daily pattern: for example, the load at 00:00 is relatively high, then it dips during the day and then rises again at night.\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture:\n   - The level and the daily seasonality.\n\n We can use a naive approach: \n   - Take the average of each hour across the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n   Day 1: 2016-10-01: values from 3.127 to 8.209\n   Day 2: 2016-10-02: values from 3.625 to 6.645\n   Day 3: 2016-10-03: values from 3.553 to 7.462\n   Day 4: 2016-10-04: values from 3.305 to 9.346\n\n There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. So we can assume stationarity in the seasonality.\n\n Therefore, we can compute the hourly average for the 4 days and use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the last day (2016-10-04) has a higher peak at 00:00 (9.346) than the previous days. But without more data, we cannot say if that is an anomaly or a trend.\n\n Since we are limited to 4 days, we will use the average per hour.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n   - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the corresponding hourly average.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values. However, in the provided data there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n However, let me check: the data we are given is exactly 96 points? \n   - From 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00: that's 4 days * 24 = 96 points. So we have 96.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create an array of 24 values: for hour 0, hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n   For hour 0 (00:00): \n        values: 8.102 (2016-10-01), 6.290 (2016-10-02), 7.214 (2016-10-03), 9.346 (2016-10-04)\n        average = (8.102 + 6.290 + 7.214 + 9.346) / 4 = 7.738\n\n   Similarly for other hours.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (2016-10-05 to 2016-10-08), we assign:\n        2016-10-05 00:00:00 -> hour0: 7.738\n        2016-10-05 01:00:00 -> hour1: average of the 01:00:00 values from the 4 days\n        ... and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we start at 2016-10-05 00:00:00 and go for 96 hours (until 2016-10-08 23:00:00).\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might not be exactly the same every day, but with only 4 days of history, this is a simple and reasonable method.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour0: (8.102 + 6.290 + 7.214 + 9.346) /4 = (30.952)/4 = 7.738\n   hour1: (8.209 + 4.548 + 6.929 + 8.493) /4 = (28.179)/4 = 7.04475\n   hour2: (8.066 + 5.295 + 6.716 + 7.533) /4 = (27.61)/4 = 6.9025\n   hour3: (7.427 + 5.224 + 7.107 + 8.386) /4 = (28.144)/4 = 7.036\n   hour4: (7.711 + 6.183 + 5.686 + 7.249) /4 = (26.829)/4 = 6.70725\n   hour5: (6.183 + 3.802 + 6.467 + 6.467) /4 = (22.919)/4 = 5.72975\n   hour6: (6.929 + 5.046 + 6.290 + 8.884) /4 = (27.149)/4 = 6.78725\n   hour7: (8.209 + 4.051 + 7.462 + 8.173) /4 = (27.895)/4 = 6.97375\n   hour8: (5.401 + 4.122 + 5.330 + 5.863) /4 = (20.716)/4 = 5.179\n   hour9: (4.335 + 4.193 + 4.193 + 4.691) /4 = (17.412)/4 = 4.353\n   hour10: (4.797 + 5.010 + 4.584 + 5.721) /4 = (20.112)/4 = 5.028\n   hour11: (4.939 + 5.010 + 4.797 + 5.792) /4 = (20.538)/4 = 5.1345\n   hour12: (4.015 + 3.625 + 3.340 + 4.762) /4 = (15.742)/4 = 3.9355\n   hour13: (4.548 + 3.660 + 4.300 + 4.477) /4 = (16.985)/4 = 4.24625\n   hour14: (4.655 + 3.944 + 4.691 + 3.909) /4 = (17.199)/4 = 4.29975\n   hour15: (4.087 + 4.833 + 4.548 + 4.797) /4 = (18.265)/4 = 4.56625\n   hour16: (3.411 + 4.371 + 4.015 + 4.015) /4 = (15.812)/4 = 3.953\n   hour17: (4.975 + 4.762 + 4.620 + 4.726) /4 = (19.083)/4 = 4.77075\n   hour18: (4.264 + 4.158 + 4.051 + 4.015) /4 = (16.488)/4 = 4.122\n   hour19: (4.406 + 4.371 + 4.264 + 4.051) /4 = (17.092)/4 = 4.273\n   hour20: (3.909 + 3.838 + 4.158 + 3.767) /4 = (15.672)/4 = 3.918\n   hour21: (3.518 + 3.625 + 3.873 + 3.305) /4 = (14.321)/4 = 3.58025\n   hour22: (3.127 + 4.548 + 3.553 + 5.401) /4 = (16.629)/4 = 4.15725\n   hour23: (5.828 + 6.645 + 5.828 + 7.427) /4 = (25.728)/4 = 6.432\n\n Now, we will generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Day 1: 2016-10-05\n        00:00:00 -> 7.738\n        01:00:00 -> 7.04475\n        02:00:00 -> 6.9025\n        03:00:00 -> 7.036\n        04:00:00 -> 6.70725\n        05:00:00 -> 5.72975\n        06:00:00 -> 6.78725\n        07:00:00 -> 6.97375\n        08:00:00 -> 5.179\n        09:00:00 -> 4.353\n        10:00:00 -> 5.028\n        11:00:00 -> 5.1345\n        12:00:00 -> 3.9355\n        13:00:00 -> 4.24625\n        14:00:00 -> 4.29975\n        15:00:00 -> 4.56625\n        16:00:00 -> 3.953\n        17:00:00 -> 4.77075\n        18:00:00 -> 4.122\n        19:00:00 -> 4.273\n        20:00:00 -> 3.918\n        21:00:00 -> 3.58025\n        22:00:00 -> 4.15725\n        23:00:00 -> 6.432\n\n   Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days (2016-10-06, 2016-10-07, 2016-10-08).\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", so we must generate 96 points.\n\n We'll generate 4 days of 24-hour blocks.\n\n But note: the data we are given ends at 2016-10-04 23:00:00, so the next point is 2016-10-05 00:00:00.\n\n We'll create the next 96 points by repeating the 24-hour average pattern for 4 days.\n\n However, we must format the dates accordingly.\n\n Steps for generating the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-10-05 00:00:00\n   Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-10-08 23:00:00.\n\n We'll have 4 days * 24 = 96 points.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'MUFL'\n\n We'll round the MUFL values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n   Day 1: 2016-10-05\n   Day 2: 2016-10-06\n   Day 3: 2016-10-07\n   Day 4: 2016-10-08\n\n We'll use the same 24 values for each day.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but in the provided data there are none. And we are generating without missing values.\n\n But the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must not have missing values.\n\n We'll generate the full 96 points.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n   We have the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals) as:\n\n        hour0: 7.738 -> round to 7.738\n        hour1: 7.04475 -> 7.045\n        hour2: 6.9025 -> 6.902\n        hour3: 7.036 -> 7.036\n        hour4: 6.70725 -> 6.707\n        hour5: 5.72975 -> 5.730\n        hour6: 6.78725 -> 6.787\n        hour7: 6.97375 -> 6.974\n        hour8: 5.179 -> 5.179\n        hour9: 4.353 -> 4.353\n        hour10: 5.028 -> 5.028\n        hour11: 5.1345 -> 5.135\n        hour12: 3.9355 -> 3.936\n        hour13: 4.24625 -> 4.246\n        hour14: 4.29975 -> 4.300\n        hour15: 4.56625 -> 4.566\n        hour16: 3.953 -> 3.953\n        hour17: 4.77075 -> 4.771\n        hour18: 4.122 -> 4.122\n        hour19: 4.273 -> 4.273\n        hour20: 3.918 -> 3.918\n        hour21: 3.58025 -> 3.580\n        hour22: 4.15725 -> 4.157\n        hour23: 6.432 -> 6.432\n\n Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n   Start date: 2016-10-05 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-10-05 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-05 23:00:00 (using the 24 values above)\n   Then 2016-10-06 00:00:00 (same as 2016-10-05 00:00:00 value, i.e., 7.738) and so on.\n\n We'll generate 4 full days.\n\n We must output in the exact format as the input, with the date in the format and the MUFL value.\n\n Format:\n\n        date                MUFL\n        2016-10-05 00:00:00 7.738\n        2016-10-05 01:00:00 7.045\n        ... \n\n We note that the input had the index as the date string, but we'll output without the index numbers (like 0,1,...) and just the two columns.\n\n We'll write 96 lines.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta (but we are not coding, we are writing the data)\n\n   Start: 2016-10-05 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour for each step.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        2016-10-05 00:00:00, [value for hour0]\n        2016-10-05 01:00:00, [value for hour1]\n        ...\n        2016-10-05 23:00:00, [value for hour23]\n        2016-10-06 00:00:00, [value for hour0]\n        ...\n        2016-10-08 23:00:00, [value for hour23]\n\n We have 4 blocks of 24.\n\n We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll output the entire block of 96 lines.\n\n However, note: the problem says the answer must be in the format:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date] [MUFL value]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n We'll write the data as:\n\n        date  MUFL\n        2016-10-05 00:00:00 7.738\n        2016-10-05 01:00:00 7.045\n        ... \n\n But note: the example input had the date as a float for MUFL with 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll round the MUFL values to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's write the data.\n",
