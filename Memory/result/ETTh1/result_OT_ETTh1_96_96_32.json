        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-06 00:00:00 to 2016-11-09 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data, we can consider a time series model that captures:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Possibly weekly seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot be captured. Hence, we rely on daily pattern.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that can extrapolate the daily pattern.\n\n 4. We can use a simple approach: \n    a) Decompose the time series into trend and seasonal components? But with only 4 days, trend might be hard to capture.\n    b) Alternatively, we can use an average daily profile and then adjust by the last available day's trend? \n\n 5. However, note that the data shows a clear daily cycle but also a downward trend over the 4 days.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    - We will compute the average of each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have.\n    - But we see a trend: the temperatures are decreasing day by day. So we might adjust the average daily pattern by the overall trend.\n\n 7. Let's calculate the daily average temperature for each day:\n      Day1 (2016-11-06): average = (19.134+19.275+...+16.18)/24\n      Day2: (15.406+15.195+...+9.708)/24\n      Day3: (10.271+10.06+...+8.16)/24\n      Day4: (8.16+7.879+...+11.748)/24\n\n    We can compute:\n      Day1: around 18.0? (19.134+19.275+19.063+18.642+18.5+18.642+17.657+15.969+16.672+17.165+17.445+18.009+18.22+19.979+20.19+19.697+20.4+20.33+19.063+17.516+16.954+16.672+16.672+16.18)/24\n      Let me calculate: \n        Sum: 19.134+19.275+19.064+18.642+18.501+18.642+17.657+15.969+16.672+17.165+17.446+18.009+18.22+19.979+20.19+19.697+20.401+20.33+19.064+17.516+16.954+16.672+16.672+16.18 = 428.831\n        Average = 428.831 / 24 = 17.8679583333\n\n      Day2: 15.406+15.195+14.914+15.125+15.476+16.039+16.321+16.25+16.743+17.235+16.954+16.883+14.491+12.803+12.1+11.467+9.426+8.512+8.934+9.426+12.029+11.326+12.733+9.708\n        Sum: 15.406+15.195+14.914+15.125+15.476+16.039+16.321+16.25+16.743+17.235+16.954+16.883+14.491+12.803+12.1+11.467+9.426+8.512+8.934+9.426+12.029+11.326+12.733+9.708 = 304.302\n        Average = 304.302 / 24 = 12.67925\n\n      Day3: 10.271+10.06+9.778+7.738+8.653+8.582+6.824+8.301+8.864+8.864+8.793+10.833+11.115+11.467+11.748+11.678+11.537+12.17+11.326+10.341+9.849+8.582+8.934+8.16\n        Sum: 10.271+10.06+9.778+7.738+8.653+8.582+6.824+8.301+8.864+8.864+8.793+10.833+11.115+11.467+11.748+11.678+11.537+12.17+11.326+10.341+9.849+8.582+8.934+8.16 = 225.309\n        Average = 225.309 / 24 = 9.387875\n\n      Day4: 8.16+7.879+7.597+8.231+7.879+7.949+7.316+7.457+7.457+9.145+9.426+10.2+9.919+9.989+10.482+11.185+12.1+12.24+12.944+12.522+12.592+12.1+12.451+11.748\n        Sum: 8.16+7.879+7.597+8.231+7.879+7.949+7.316+7.457+7.457+9.145+9.426+10.2+9.919+9.989+10.482+11.185+12.1+12.24+12.944+12.522+12.592+12.1+12.451+11.748 = 230.268\n        Average = 230.268 / 24 = 9.5945\n\n    The daily averages show a trend: 17.87, 12.68, 9.39, 9.59 -> but note the last day increased slightly.\n\n 8. We can model the trend component separately. Let's fit a linear regression to the daily averages (with time index: 1,2,3,4) and then project for the next 4 days (time index: 5,6,7,8).\n\n    Time indices: [1,2,3,4] -> averages: [17.8679583333, 12.67925, 9.387875, 9.5945]\n\n    We can fit a linear model: y = a + b*x\n\n    But note: the last two days are around 9.5, so the trend might be flattening. We might use a moving average of the last two days for the next days? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing for the level? \n\n 9. Since we are forecasting 96 points (4 days) and we have 4 days of history, we can also use a naive method: \n    - Use the last day (day4) as the base daily pattern and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n 10. However, we note that the problem says there might be missing values? But in the given 96 points we don't have any. So for forecasting, we assume no missing in the output.\n\n 11. We can do:\n     - Compute the hourly profile (average for each hour) over the 4 days? But the trend is strong so we cannot average without detrending.\n\n 12. Another approach: \n     - Remove the daily average from each day to get the intraday pattern (anomalies).\n     - Then average the intraday patterns of the 4 days to get a common daily pattern.\n     - Then forecast the daily average for the next 4 days (using a trend model) and then add the common daily pattern.\n\n 13. Steps for the model:\n\n     a) For each day d (from 1 to 4), compute the daily average: avg_d.\n     b) For each hour h (0 to 23) in day d, compute the deviation: dev_d,h = OT_d,h - avg_d.\n     c) Then, for each hour h, compute the average deviation over the 4 days: dev_h = (dev_1,h + dev_2,h + dev_3,h + dev_4,h) / 4.\n\n     d) Now, we have a common daily pattern (dev_h for h in 0..23).\n\n     e) Forecast the daily average for the next 4 days (days 5,6,7,8). We can use:\n          - Linear regression on the 4 points? \n          - Or since the trend is flattening, we can use the average of the last two days: (9.387875+9.5945)/2 = 9.4911875 for day5, and then assume it stabilizes? \n          - But we see a slight increase from day3 to day4. We can use a linear model but with only 4 points and the last two being similar, we can project a flat trend.\n\n        Let's try linear regression:\n\n          x = [1,2,3,4], y = [17.8679583333, 12.67925, 9.387875, 9.5945]\n\n          We can compute:\n            n = 4\n            sum_x = 10, sum_y = 49.5295833333\n            sum_xy = 1*17.8679583333 + 2*12.67925 + 3*9.387875 + 4*9.5945 = 17.8679583333 + 25.3585 + 28.163625 + 38.378 = 109.7680833333\n            sum_x2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n            b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - sum_x^2) \n               = (4*109.7680833333 - 10*49.5295833333) / (4*30 - 100)\n               = (439.0723333332 - 495.295833333) / (120 - 100)\n               = (-56.2235) / 20 = -2.811175\n\n            a = (sum_y - b*sum_x)/n = (49.5295833333 - (-2.811175)*10)/4 = (49.5295833333 + 28.11175)/4 = 77.6413333333/4 = 19.4103333333\n\n          So the trend line: y = 19.4103333333 - 2.811175 * x\n\n          For day5 (x=5): y5 = 19.4103333333 - 2.811175*5 = 19.4103333333 - 14.055875 = 5.3544583333\n          day6 (x=6): 19.4103333333 - 2.811175*6 = 19.4103333333 - 16.86705 = 2.5432833333\n          day7 (x=7): 19.4103333333 - 2.811175*7 = 19.4103333333 - 19.678225 = -0.2678916667\n          day8 (x=8): 19.4103333333 - 2.811175*8 = 19.4103333333 - 22.4894 = -3.0790666667\n\n        This gives negative temperatures? But the data we have is as low as 6.8. However, the trend is decreasing and we are projecting further decrease.\n\n        But note: the last two days were around 9.5, and the linear model is projecting a steep decline? This might not be appropriate.\n\n     f) Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model for the daily average? But we have 4 points.\n\n     g) Given the recent stabilization, we might use the average of the last two days as the level and then project a flat line? \n\n        Let's use: \n          day5: (9.387875 + 9.5945)/2 = 9.4911875\n          day6: same as day5? or we can use the last day (day4) and assume no change? \n\n        But note: the problem does not give any external variables (like load) so we are only using the pattern.\n\n        We see that the daily average dropped from 17.87 to 12.68 (day1 to day2) and then to 9.39 (day3) and then slightly up to 9.59 (day4). \n        It might be stabilizing. So we can project the next 4 days as the average of the last two days: 9.4911875.\n\n        However, to be safe, we can use a moving average of the last two days for each of the next four days.\n\n        So:\n          day5: (day3+day4)/2 = (9.387875+9.5945)/2 = 9.4911875\n          day6: (day4+day5)/2 = (9.5945+9.4911875)/2 = 9.54284375\n          day7: (day5+day6)/2 = (9.4911875+9.54284375)/2 = 9.517015625\n          day8: (day6+day7)/2 = (9.54284375+9.517015625)/2 = 9.5299296875\n\n        This is a bit arbitrary.\n\n     h) Another idea: use the last value (day4) for the next 4 days? \n\n        day5: 9.5945\n        day6: 9.5945\n        day7: 9.5945\n        day8: 9.5945\n\n     i) Given the fluctuations, and without more data, we choose to use the last day's average (day4: 9.5945) for the next 4 days? \n\n        Why? Because the last day is the most recent and the trend from day3 to day4 was positive. But we don't have enough to project a trend. \n\n     j) We'll use the daily average of the last day (day4: 9.5945) for the next 4 days.\n\n 14. Then, for each day in the forecast (days 5,6,7,8) and for each hour h (0 to 23), the forecast is:\n        forecast_d,h = daily_avg_forecast_d + dev_h\n\n     where dev_h is the average deviation for hour h computed from the 4 days.\n\n 15. How to compute dev_h?\n\n     We have for each day d and hour h: \n        dev_d,h = OT_d,h - avg_d\n\n     Then for each hour h (0 to 23), we average the deviations over d=1 to 4.\n\n     Example for h=0 (00:00:00):\n        day1: 19.134001 - 17.8679583333 = 1.2660426667\n        day2: 15.406 - 12.67925 = 2.72675\n        day3: 10.271 - 9.387875 = 0.883125\n        day4: 8.16 - 9.5945 = -1.4345\n        average_dev_h0 = (1.2660426667 + 2.72675 + 0.883125 - 1.4345) / 4 = (3.4414176667) / 4 = 0.8603544167\n\n     Then for day5 (2016-11-10 00:00:00): \n        forecast = 9.5945 + 0.8603544167 = 10.4548544167\n\n 16. But note: we are using the same daily pattern (dev_h) and the same daily average (9.5945) for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. However, we must generate 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). \n\n 18. Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n     a) Precompute the average for each day (we have done for day1 to day4).\n     b) Precompute the deviation for each hour in each day.\n     c) For each hour of the day (0 to 23), compute the average deviation: dev_h = (dev_day1_h + dev_day2_h + dev_day3_h + dev_day4_h) / 4.\n     d) For the next 4 days (starting from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00), for each day d in [5,6,7,8]:\n            daily_avg_forecast = 9.5945   (the last observed day's average)\n        Then for hour h in 0..23:\n            OT_forecast = daily_avg_forecast + dev_h\n\n     e) This will give us 4 identical days? \n\n 19. But note: the daily pattern might change? However, we are capturing the common pattern from the 4 days. And we are using the same pattern for each forecast day.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we could use the daily pattern from the last day only? But that might be noisy. The average over 4 days is more stable.\n\n 21. However, we see that the pattern might be changing? For example, the drop from day1 to day4 is significant. \n\n 22. We might consider using the deviations from the last day only?)\n\n     But the problem: we are forecasting 4 days and we have 4 days of history. We are not sure. \n\n 23. Given the ambiguity, and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will use the method above (average deviations over the 4 days and the last day's average for the next 4 days).\n\n 24. Let's compute the dev_h for each hour:\n\n     We have the 4 days of data. We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and compute the average deviation.\n\n     We'll do:\n\n        hour0: [19.134001 - 17.8679583333, 15.406 - 12.67925, 10.271 - 9.387875, 8.16 - 9.5945] \n        = [1.2660426667, 2.72675, 0.883125, -1.4345] -> average = (1.2660426667+2.72675+0.883125-1.4345)/4 = 3.4414176667/4 = 0.8603544167\n\n        hour1: [19.275 - 17.8679583333, 15.195 - 12.67925, 10.06 - 9.387875, 7.879 - 9.5945]\n        = [1.4070416667, 2.51575, 0.672125, -1.7155] -> average = (1.4070416667+2.51575+0.672125-1.7155)/4 = 2.8794166667/4 = 0.7198541667\n\n        ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n 25. We must do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 26. Then, for each of the next 4 days, we will have the same 24 values? \n\n 27. The forecast dates:\n\n        Day5: 2016-11-10 00:00:00 to 2016-11-10 23:00:00\n        Day6: 2016-11-11 00:00:00 to 2016-11-11 23:00:00\n        Day7: 2016-11-12 00:00:00 to 2016-11-12 23:00:00\n        Day8: 2016-11-13 00:00:00 to 2016-11-13 23:00:00\n\n 28. We'll generate 96 points.\n\n 29. Implementation:\n\n     Step 1: Parse the given data and split into 4 days (each day 24 hours).\n\n     Step 2: Compute the daily average for each day.\n\n        day1: indices 0-23 -> average1 = 17.8679583333\n        day2: indices 24-47 -> average2 = 12.67925\n        day3: indices 48-71 -> average3 = 9.387875\n        day4: indices 72-95 -> average4 = 9.5945\n\n     Step 3: For each hour in the day (0-23), compute the deviation for that hour in each day and then average.\n\n        dev_h = [0.0]*24\n        for h in range(24):\n            dev_h[h] = ( (data[h] - avg1) + (data[24+h] - avg2) + (data[48+h] - avg3) + (data[72+h] - avg4) ) / 4.0\n\n     Step 4: The forecast for any day in the future (for the next 4 days) at hour h is: \n             forecast = avg4 + dev_h[h]\n\n     Step 5: We generate 4 days: for day in 0..3 (representing day5 to day8), for hour in 0..23:\n             value = avg4 + dev_h[hour]\n\n     Step 6: Format the dates: \n             Start from 2016-11-10 00:00:00 (which is the next after 2016-11-09 23:00:00)\n\n 30. Let's compute the dev_h array:\n\n     We'll do it programmatically in our mind? But we are writing step by step.\n\n     Alternatively, we can write a small table? But 24 hours.\n\n     We'll do it in code? But we are not coding, so we have to compute 24 values.\n\n     However, due to the length, we can do a few and then extrapolate? But we must be accurate.\n\n     We'll compute the dev_h for all 24 hours.\n\n     Given the time, we will compute:\n\n        h0: ( (19.134001 - 17.8679583333) + (15.406 - 12.67925) + (10.271 -

The input has 3 decimals. But the input has up to 6? \n\n     The input data has 3 decimal places? But we see 19.134001 -> 6 decimals. We'll keep 3 decimal places? \n\n     The problem does not specify. We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n     But note: the input has mixed: some 3, some 6. We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n     So we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. Generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2016-11-10 00:00:00\n     Then 2016-11-10 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-13 23:00:00.\n\n 33. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 34. We must be cautious: the last given date is 2016-11-09 23:00:00, so the first forecast is 2016-11-10 00:00:00.\n\n 35. Let's write the forecast for the first day (2016-11-10) as an example:\n\n        h0: 9.4548544167 -> 10.455\n        h1: 9.5945 + 0.7198541667 = 10.3143541667 -> 10.314\n        h2: 9.5945 + 0.4558539167 = 10.0503539167 -> 10.050\n        h3: 9.5945 + 0.0516041667 = 9.6461041667 -> 9.646\n        h4: 9.5945 + 0.2448539167 = 9.8393539167 -> 9.839\n        h5: 9.5945 + 0.4206041667 = 10.0151041667 -> 10.015\n        h6: 9.5945 - 0.3528958333 = 9.2416041667 -> 9.242\n        h7: 9.5945 - 0.3881458333 = 9.2063541667 -> 9.206\n        h8: 9.5945 + 0.0516044167 = 9.6461044167 -> 9.646\n        h9: 9.5945 + 0.7198544167 = 10.3143544167 -> 10.314\n        h10: 9.5945 + 0.7723539167 = 10.3668539167 -> 10.367\n        h11: 9.5945 + 1.5988541667 = 11.1933541667 -> 11.193\n        h12: 9.5945 + 1.0538539167 = 10.6483539167 -> 10.648\n        h13: 9.5945 + 1.1771041667 = 10.7716041667 -> 10.772\n        h14: 9.5945 + 1.2476044167 = 10.8421044167 -> 10.842\n        h15: 9.5945 + 1.1243544167 = 10.7188544167 -> 10.719\n        h16: 9.5945 + 0.9836039167 = 10.5781039167 -> 10.578\n        h17: 9.5945 + 0.9306041667 = 10.5251041667 -> 10.525\n        h18: 9.5945 + 0.6846039167 = 10.2791039167 -> 10.279\n        h19: 9.5945 + 0.0688544167 = 9.6633544167 -> 9.663\n        h20: 9.5945 + 0.4736041667 = 10.0681041667 -> 10.068\n        h21: 9.5945 - 0.2123955833 = 9.3821044167 -> 9.382\n        h22: 9.5945 + 0.3151044167 = 9.9096044167 -> 9.910\n        h23: 9.5945 - 0.9333958333 = 8.6611041667 -> 8.661\n\n     And then the next 3 days are the same? \n\n 36. But wait, we are using the same daily pattern and the same daily average for all 4 days. So the forecast for each day will be identical.\n\n 37. However, the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are not given any in the input. \n\n 38. We output 4 identical days? \n\n 39. But note: the real data might have a trend? We are not capturing the trend in the daily average for the future. \n\n 40. Given the ambiguity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we output 4 identical days.\n\n 41. We'll write the 96 points: 4 times the same 24 values.\n\n 42.

We'll list the 24 values for one day:\n\n        hour0: 10.455\n        hour1: 10.314\n        hour2: 10.050\n        hour3: 9.646\n        hour4: 9.839\n        hour5: 10.015\n        hour6: 9.242\n        hour7: 9.206\n        hour8: 9.646\n        hour9: 10.314\n        hour10: 10.367\n        hour11: 11.193\n        hour12: 10.648\n        hour13: 10.772\n        hour14: 10.842\n        hour15: 10.719\n        hour16: 10.578\n        hour17: 10.525\n        hour18: 10.279\n        hour19: 9.663\n        hour20: 10.068\n        hour21: 9.382\n        hour22: 9.910\n        hour23: 8.661\n\n 54. Then repeat for 2016-11-10, 2016-11-11, 2016-11-12, 2016-11-13.\n\n 55. We'll write the answer.\n",
