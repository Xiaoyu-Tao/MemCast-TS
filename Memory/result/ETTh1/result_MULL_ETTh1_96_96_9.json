        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input. Since the given data is complete, we can proceed.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. The last timestamp is 2016-08-09 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the seasonality (daily pattern), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n    Options:\n      - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): suitable for seasonal data with multiple seasons? But we have only 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days. \n        The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours). However, with only 4 days, it might be challenging to fit a seasonal model with 24 periods.\n\n      - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n\n      - Alternatively, we can use a simple method like taking the average of the same hour in the past days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n    Considering the limited data (only 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days, we can try to capture the daily pattern by averaging the same hour across the available days.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a stable pattern? Let's look at the data:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-08-06): \n            Min: 2.345 (at 21:00) and Max: 4.193 (at 02:00)\n        Day 2 (2016-08-07): \n            Min: 2.559 (at 19:00) and Max: 4.229 (at 23:00)\n        Day 3 (2016-08-08): \n            Min: 1.599 (at 20:00) and Max: 4.726 (at 05:00) -> note the very low value at 20:00\n        Day 4 (2016-08-09): \n            Min: 2.701 (at 20:00) and Max: 4.833 (at 04:00)\n\n    There is some variation. We can try to compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n\n    But note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we can use the 4 days to compute the average.\n\n    However, the average might smooth out the pattern and we might lose the daily variation. Also, the very low value on day 3 at 20:00 might be an outlier? \n    But without more context, we have to use the available data.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the trend and seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, I propose to use the following:\n\n    We have 4 days of data. We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that average for each day in the forecast period.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        - Group the data by hour (i.e., for hour 0: 00:00 of each day, hour 1: 01:00, ... hour 23: 23:00).\n        - Compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (2016-08-10 to 2016-08-13), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n    Why this approach?\n        - It captures the daily seasonality.\n        - It is simple and we have exactly 4 days to average.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a trend? Looking at the data, there is no obvious increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. \n    The values on day 3 and 4 seem a bit higher? But without more data, we cannot be sure. So we ignore the trend and focus on the daily pattern.\n\n 5. Implementation:\n\n    We'll create a list of 24 hours (0 to 23) and for each hour, we take the values at that hour from the 4 days and average them.\n\n    Example for hour 0 (00:00):\n        Day1: 3.589\n        Day2: 3.625\n        Day3: 3.305\n        Day4: 3.305\n        Average = (3.589 + 3.625 + 3.305 + 3.305) / 4 = 3.456\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, at 00:00 we will use 3.456.\n\n 6. But note: the last day in the data is 2016-08-09 (Tuesday). The next 4 days would be:\n        2016-08-10: Wednesday\n        2016-08-11: Thursday\n        2016-08-12: Friday\n        2016-08-13: Saturday\n\n    We are not accounting for weekly seasonality because we only have 4 days (which are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? Actually, 2016-08-06 is Saturday, 2016-08-07 Sunday, 2016-08-08 Monday, 2016-08-09 Tuesday). \n    The next days: 2016-08-10 Wednesday, 2016-08-11 Thursday, 2016-08-12 Friday, 2016-08-13 Saturday.\n\n    The pattern might change on weekends? But we have only one Saturday and one Sunday in the training. So we cannot capture weekly seasonality. Therefore, we use the same daily pattern for all days.\n\n 7. Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n    - Calculate the average for each of the 24 hours (0 to 23) from the 4 days of data.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average for hour 0 to the 00:00 of each day, hour 1 to 01:00, etc.\n\n 8. Let's compute the averages:\n\n    We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and collect the values.\n\n    Hour 0: [3.589, 3.625, 3.305, 3.305] -> average = (3.589+3.625+3.305+3.305)/4 = 13.824/4 = 3.456\n    Hour 1: [3.909, 3.625, 4.691, 3.020] -> (3.909+3.625+4.691+3.020)/4 = 15.245/4 = 3.81125\n    Hour 2: [4.193, 3.944, 4.158, 3.020] -> (4.193+3.944+4.158+3.020)/4 = 15.315/4 = 3.82875\n    Hour 3: [3.838, 3.340, 4.051, 4.762] -> (3.838+3.340+4.051+4.762)/4 = 15.991/4 = 3.99775\n    Hour 4: [3.447, 3.376, 4.122, 4.833] -> (3.447+3.376+4.122+4.833)/4 = 15.778/4 = 3.9445\n    Hour 5: [3.411, 3.305, 4.726, 4.655] -> (3.411+3.305+4.726+4.655)/4 = 16.097/4 = 4.02425\n    Hour 6: [3.234, 3.625, 4.513, 3.553] -> (3.234+3.625+4.513+3.553)/4 = 14.925/4 = 3.73125\n    Hour 7: [3.198, 3.980, 4.087, 3.127] -> (3.198+3.980+4.087+3.127)/4 = 14.392/4 = 3.598\n    Hour 8: [3.234, 4.087, 3.234, 3.447] -> (3.234+4.087+3.234+3.447)/4 = 14.002/4 = 3.5005\n    Hour 9: [3.305, 3.482, 3.020, 3.376] -> (3.305+3.482+3.020+3.376)/4 = 13.183/4 = 3.29575\n    Hour 10: [3.234, 3.092, 3.305, 4.051] -> (3.234+3.092+3.305+4.051)/4 = 13.682/4 = 3.4205\n    Hour 11: [3.056, 3.020, 3.589, 2.985] -> (3.056+3.020+3.589+2.985)/4 = 12.65/4 = 3.1625\n    Hour 12: [3.056, 2.949, 2.878, 3.163] -> (3.056+2.949+2.878+3.163)/4 = 12.046/4 = 3.0115\n    Hour 13: [2.701, 3.447, 2.701, 3.092] -> (2.701+3.447+2.701+3.092)/4 = 11.941/4 = 2.98525\n    Hour 14: [2.665, 3.163, 3.411, 3.589] -> (2.665+3.163+3.411+3.589)/4 = 12.828/4 = 3.207\n    Hour 15: [2.985, 3.305, 3.482, 3.056] -> (2.985+3.305+3.482+3.056)/4 = 12.828/4 = 3.207\n    Hour 16: [3.020, 3.198, 3.802, 3.376] -> (3.020+3.198+3.802+3.376)/4 = 13.396/4 = 3.349\n    Hour 17: [2.772, 3.092, 3.340, 3.376] -> (2.772+3.092+3.340+3.376)/4 = 12.58/4 = 3.145\n    Hour 18: [2.807, 2.807, 2.985, 2.878] -> (2.807+2.807+2.985+2.878)/4 = 11.477/4 = 2.86925\n    Hour 19: [2.381, 2.559, 2.914, 2.772] -> (2.381+2.559+2.914+2.772)/4 = 10.626/4 = 2.6565\n    Hour 20: [2.665, 3.340, 1.599, 2.701] -> (2.665+3.340+1.599+2.701)/4 = 10.305/4 = 2.57625\n    Hour 21: [2.345, 3.411, 3.198, 3.411] -> (2.345+3.411+3.198+3.411)/4 = 12.365/4 = 3.09125\n    Hour 22: [3.056, 3.625, 3.127, 4.371] -> (3.056+3.625+3.127+4.371)/4 = 14.179/4 = 3.54475\n    Hour 23: [3.696, 4.229, 2.985, 3.909] -> (3.696+4.229+2.985+3.909)/4 = 14.819/4 = 3.70475\n\n 9. Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n    The next 4: \n        Day1: 2016-08-10 (Wednesday) -> hours 0 to 23: use the averages for hour0 to hour23.\n        Day2: 2016-08-11 (Thursday) -> same averages\n        Day3: 2016-08-12 (Friday) -> same\n        Day4: 2016-08-13 (Saturday) -> same\n\n    So the forecast for the next 96 hours is the 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n 10. Format the output:\n\n        We must output the next 96 timestamps and the corresponding MULL value (the average for that hour).\n\n        The first forecasted timestamp: 2016-08-10 00:00:00 -> 3.456\n        Then 2016-08-10 01:00:00 -> 3.81125\n        ... until 2016-08-13 23:00:00 -> 3.70475\n\n 11. We will round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n    But note: the input has 3 decimal places. So we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n        Hour0: 3.456 -> 3.456\n        Hour1: 3.81125 -> 3.811\n        Hour2: 3.82875 -> 3.829\n        Hour3: 3.99775 -> 3.998\n        Hour4: 3.9445 -> 3.944\n        Hour5: 4.02425 -> 4.024\n        Hour6: 3.73125 -> 3.731\n        Hour7: 3.598 -> 3.598\n        Hour8: 3.5005 -> 3.501\n        Hour9: 3.29575 -> 3.296\n        Hour10: 3.4205 -> 3.421\n        Hour11: 3.1625 -> 3.163\n        Hour12: 3.0115 -> 3.012\n        Hour13: 2.98525 -> 2.985\n        Hour14: 3.207 -> 3.207\n        Hour15: 3.207 -> 3.207\n        Hour16: 3.349 -> 3.349\n        Hour17: 3.145 -> 3.145\n        Hour18: 2.86925 -> 2.869\n        Hour19: 2.6565 -> 2.657\n        Hour20: 2.57625 -> 2.576\n        Hour21: 3.09125 -> 3.091\n        Hour22: 3.54475 -> 3.545\n        Hour23: 3.70475 -> 3.705\n\n 12. Now, for the next 4 days, we repeat these 24 values.\n\n 13. Generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-10 00:00:00\n        Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n 14. Write the output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are only given any in the provided 96 points. We are forecasting the next 96 without missing.\n\n But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n We are providing 96 points without missing.\n\n Let's code the output.\n\n But note: the input data has the date format as \"2016-08-06 00:00:00\", so we must output the same.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    We'll create a list of the 24 average values (rounded to 3 decimals) for hours 0 to 23.\n\n    Then, for each day in the next 4 days (from 2016-08-10 to 2016-08-13), we assign the 24 values.\n\n    We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        day1: 2016-08-10\n        day2: 2016-08-11\n        day3: 2016-08-12\n        day4: 2016-08-13\n\n    And for each day, we generate 24 hours.\n\n 15.
