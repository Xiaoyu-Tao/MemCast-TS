        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are exactly 96 records without any explicit missing values (NaNs). \n    However, the problem states: \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". But in the given data, we don't see any missing. \n    So we assume that the provided 96 points are complete, but we must handle potential missing values in the forecasting process appropriately.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a model. Given the relatively small data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon), \n    we can use a model that can capture seasonality and trends. However, note that we only have 4 days of data, so it's hard to capture weekly seasonality (which would require at least one week of data). \n    But we can see daily patterns (24 hours). \n\n 4. We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24 hours). We can see that the values drop during certain hours and rise at others.\n\n 5. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates (from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00).\n\n 6. Approach:\n    - We will use a model that can handle time series with seasonality. Given the small data size, we might use:\n        a) Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components (trend, seasonal, residual) but with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n        b) Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which can capture seasonality. However, we have only 4 days (one cycle of 24 hours) so we can set the seasonal period to 24.\n        c) Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal component (SARIMA) but with only 96 points and 24 seasonal period, the model might be too complex.\n\n    Given the constraints, we have to be cautious. We'll use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n 7. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided data we don't have any, but to be safe we can impute if necessary. \n    Since we don't have missing in the given 96, we proceed without imputation.\n\n 8. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n    - Create a time series object with frequency=24 (since we have hourly data and daily seasonality).\n    - Fit a Holt-Winters model (ExponentialSmoothing in statsmodels) with additive trend and additive seasonality, or try without trend? \n      The data doesn't show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days, so we might use additive seasonality and damped trend or no trend.\n\n 9. But note: we are not coding, we are to provide the forecasted values. So we have to simulate the process.\n\n 10. Since we cannot run actual code, we have to rely on a reasonable method. We can compute the daily average for each hour and then adjust by the overall level.\n\n 11. Alternative approach without complex modeling:\n      - Calculate the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days, we use these hourly averages. But this ignores any trend and the last day's pattern might be more relevant.\n\n 12. However, looking at the data, the last day (2016-08-09) has a spike at 03:00 (8.239) and 04:00 (7.435) which is not present in the previous days. \n     So a simple average might smooth out that spike. \n\n 13. We can also consider using the last day (2016-08-09) as a template and adjust by the overall level of the previous days? \n\n 14. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we decide to use the Holt-Winters method conceptually. We'll describe the steps and then provide the forecast.\n\n 15. But note: we must output the next 96 points. Without running actual code, we can simulate by:\n\n      Step 1: Decompose the time series into level, trend, and seasonal components (using additive model) with period=24.\n      Step 2: Forecast the level and trend for the next 96 steps and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 16. However, without actual computation, we can approximate:\n\n      We can compute the baseline (level) as the average of the entire series, and the seasonal indices for each hour.\n\n      How to compute seasonal indices for additive model:\n        - Calculate the average for each hour (across the 4 days) -> hourly_avg\n        - Calculate the overall average (total_avg)\n        - Then seasonal index for hour i: hourly_avg[i] - total_avg\n\n      Then, for forecasting, we can use the last value of the series and assume no trend (since the trend is not strong) and then add the seasonal index for the corresponding hour.\n\n      But this would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n 17. We can also use the last 4 days to compute the average for each hour and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (5.760 + 5.559 + 4.823 + 6.296) / 4 = (5.760+5.559+4.823+6.296)/4 = 22.438/4 = 5.6095\n        hour1: (6.363+5.358+6.631+5.760)/4 = (6.363+5.358+6.631+5.760)=24.112/4=6.028\n        ... and so on.\n\n      Then the forecast for 2016-08-10 00:00:00 (which is the next day, hour0) would be 5.6095? \n\n 19. But note: the last day (2016-08-09) had a spike. The average might smooth it. Alternatively, we can use the last day as a base and adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n 20. Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, but if we see an increasing or decreasing pattern, we might adjust. However, the data does not show a clear trend.\n\n 21. Given the instructions and the need to provide a complete answer, we decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 22. Steps:\n\n      - Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the mean for the corresponding hour.\n\n 23. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n 24. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [5.760, 5.559, 4.823, 6.296] -> mean = (5.760+5.559+4.823+6.296)/4 = 5.6095\n        hour1: [6.363,5.358,6.631,5.760] -> (6.363+5.358+6.631+5.760)/4 = 6.028\n        hour2: [5.961,5.492,6.162,5.827] -> (5.961+5.492+6.162+5.827)/4 = 5.8605\n        hour3: [5.894,5.090,5.961,8.239] -> (5.894+5.090+5.961+8.239)/4 = 6.296\n        hour4: [6.296,4.890,6.229,7.435] -> (6.296+4.890+6.229+7.435)/4 = 6.2125\n        hour5: [6.296,4.287,5.559,8.038] -> (6.296+4.287+5.559+8.038)/4 = 6.045\n        hour6: [6.229,5.224,5.894,6.363] -> (6.229+5.224+5.894+6.363)/4 = 5.9275\n        hour7: [6.028,5.626,5.827,6.430] -> (6.028+5.626+5.827+6.430)/4 = 5.97775\n        hour8: [5.492,5.358,5.224,5.224] -> (5.492+5.358+5.224+5.224)/4 = 5.3245\n        hour9: [5.358,4.756,4.622,5.224] -> (5.358+4.756+4.622+5.224)/4 = 4.99\n        hour10: [4.756,5.023,5.626,6.028] -> (4.756+5.023+5.626+6.028)/4 = 5.35825\n        hour11: [4.823,5.492,5.559,5.827] -> (4.823+5.492+5.559+5.827)/4 = 5.42525\n        hour12: [4.488,4.153,4.555,5.224] -> (4.488+4.153+4.555+5.224)/4 = 4.605\n        hour13: [4.622,5.023,4.354,4.957] -> (4.622+5.023+4.354+4.957)/4 = 4.739\n        hour14: [4.086,5.090,5.492,5.559] -> (4.086+5.090+5.492+5.559)/4 = 5.05675\n        hour15: [4.555,5.492,5.626,5.559] -> (4.555+5.492+5.626+5.559)/4 = 5.308\n        hour16: [4.689,4.756,5.492,5.358] -> (4.689+4.756+5.492+5.358)/4 = 5.07375\n        hour17: [4.555,4.622,5.358,5.157] -> (4.555+4.622+5.358+5.157)/4 = 4.923\n        hour18: [4.421,4.488,4.756,4.555] -> (4.421+4.488+4.756+4.555)/4 = 4.555\n        hour19: [3.885,4.086,4.622,4.354] -> (3.885+4.086+4.622+4.354)/4 = 4.23675\n        hour20: [4.555,5.224,3.952,4.555] -> (4.555+5.224+3.952+4.555)/4 = 4.5715\n        hour21: [4.287,5.090,5.626,5.023] -> (4.287+5.090+5.626+5.023)/4 = 5.0065\n        hour22: [4.957,5.693,5.559,6.095] -> (4.957+5.693+5.559+6.095)/4 = 5.576\n        hour23: [5.358,6.229,5.090,6.095] -> (5.358+6.229+5.090+6.095)/4 = 5.693\n\n 25. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-08-10): \n            00:00:00 -> 5.6095\n            01:00:00 -> 6.028\n            02:00:00 -> 5.8605\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 5.693\n\n        Day 2 (2016-08-11): same 24 values repeated\n        Day 3 (2016-08-12): same\n        Day 4 (2016-08-13): same\n\n 26. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are forecasting without gaps.\n\n 27. We output the data in the same format, with the date and the HULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n 28. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-10 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-08-10 01:00:00 ... until 2016-08-13 23:00:00.\n\n 29. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 30. However, note that the input data has 4 days and we are using the average of these 4 days for each hour. This is a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n 31. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 32. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        First 24 hours (2016-08-10):\n            '2016-08-10 00:00:00' : 5.610   (rounded to 3 decimals)\n            '2016-08-10 01:00:00' : 6.028\n            ... and so on.\n\n 33. We round the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 34. Computed averages rounded:\n\n        hour0: 5.6095 -> 5.610\n        hour1: 6.028 -> 6.028\n        hour2: 5.8605 -> 5.861\n        hour3: 6.296 -> 6.296\n        hour4: 6.2125 -> 6.213\n        hour5: 6.045 -> 6.045\n        hour6: 5.9275 -> 5.928\n        hour7: 5.97775 -> 5.978\n        hour8: 5.3245 -> 5.325\n        hour9: 4.99 -> 4.990\n        hour10: 5.35825 -> 5.358\n        hour11: 5.42525 -> 5.425\n        hour12: 4.605 -> 4.605\n        hour13: 4.739 -> 4.739\n        hour14: 5.05675 -> 5.057\n        hour15: 5.308 -> 5.308\n        hour16: 5.07375 -> 5.074\n        hour17: 4.923 -> 4.923\n        hour18: 4.555 -> 4.555\n        hour19: 4.23675 -> 4.237\n        hour20: 4.5715 -> 4.572\n        hour21: 5.0065 -> 5.007\n        hour22: 5.576 -> 5.576\n        hour23: 5.693 -> 5.693\n\n 35. Then the next 4 days will repeat these 24 values.\n\n 36. We write the data in the format.\n\n 37. Note: The dates must be generated correctly. The last given date is 2016-08-09 23:00:00, so the next date is 2016-08-10 00:00:00.\n\n 38. We generate 96 rows.\n\n 39. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-10 00:00:00 5.610\n2016-08-10 01:00:00 6.028\n2016-08-10 02:00:00 5.861\n... \n2016-08-13 23:00:00 5.693\n```\n\n 40. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 41. Let's do it.\n\n 42. We'll create a list of the 24 hourly averages (rounded) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 43. The list of hourly averages (for 0 to 23) in order:\n\n        [5.610, 6.028, 5.861, 6.296, 6.213, 6.045, 5.928, 5.978, 5.325, 4.990, 5.358, 5.425, 4.605, 4.739, 5.057, 5.308, 5.074, 4.923, 4.555, 4.237, 4.572, 5.007, 5.576, 5.693]\n\n 44. Then for each day from 2016-08-10 to 2016-08-13, we assign these 24 values.\n\n 45. We generate the dates:\n\n        day1: 2016-08-10\n        day2: 2016-08-11\n        day3: 2016-08-12\n        day4: 2016-08-13\n\n 46. We output the data.\n\n 47. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be strictly followed.\n\n 48. We write the answer accordingly.\n",
