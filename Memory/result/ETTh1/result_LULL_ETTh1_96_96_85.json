        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00) for the variable \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some negative values and potential anomalies (like the drop on 2017-06-07 07:00:00 to -0.366). \n    However, without more context, we must proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. Since the data is time series with an hourly frequency, we can consider using a) statistical models (like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) or \n    b) machine learning models (like LSTM, Prophet) for forecasting. However, the problem requires a complete set of 96 forecasted values.\n\n 3. Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models that require extensive training. Instead, we can use a simple model that captures:\n    - Seasonality: The data appears to have daily seasonality (24 hours). We can see patterns repeating every 24 hours, though with some noise and a shift in pattern after the drop.\n\n 4. We observe that the first day (2017-06-06) has positive values and then from 2017-06-07 onwards, the values become negative. \n    This might indicate a change in the operating condition. However, for forecasting, we must rely on the most recent patterns.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We can use a seasonal naive method: using the last available day (2017-06-09) as the forecast for the next day (2017-06-10), then the day before (2017-06-08) for 2017-06-11, and so on? \n      But note: we are forecasting 96 hours (4 days). However, the pattern might not be exactly repeating.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use an autoregressive model. But with only 96 points, and the need for 96 forecasts, we must be cautious.\n\n 6. Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete answer, we can use:\n    - The last 24 hours (2017-06-09) to forecast the next 24 hours (2017-06-10).\n    - Then, we can use the 24 hours before that (2017-06-08) for 2017-06-11, and so on? But that would be arbitrary.\n\n    However, note that the data shows a downward trend and then stabilizes? The last two days (2017-06-08 and 2017-06-09) are similar but with a slight variation.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the average of the last two days (2017-06-08 and 2017-06-09) for each hour to forecast the next two days? But we have to forecast 4 days.\n\n 8. Given the ambiguity, we must provide a forecast. We note that the data after the drop (from 2017-06-07 07:00:00) is negative and relatively stable. \n    We can assume that the series has stabilized and use the last observed day (2017-06-09) repeated for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 copies of the same day.\n\n    However, the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the 96 points? So we have to forecast 96 points.\n\n 9. We decide to use:\n    - For the first 24 hours (2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-10 23:00:00): the values from 2017-06-09 (the last day) plus a small random noise to account for variability? \n      But the problem says we must provide the complete data and we are not told to add noise. Alternatively, we can use exactly the same day.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot see weekly.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we will use the following:\n     - We will use the next 4 days by repeating the last 96 hours? But that would be the same as the past 4 days. However, the pattern changed on 2017-06-07.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days (which are similar) for each hour and then repeat that for 4 days? \n\n 11. Let's break down:\n      Day1: 2017-06-06 (positive values) -> not representative of the recent pattern.\n      Day2: 2017-06-07 (transition: starts positive then drops to negative and stays negative)\n      Day3: 2017-06-08 (all negative, stable)\n      Day4: 2017-06-09 (all negative, stable)\n\n     The last two days (2017-06-08 and 2017-06-09) are the most recent and stable. We can average these two days for each hour to form a \"typical day\" and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps for averaging:\n        For hour 00:00: average of 2017-06-08 00:00:00 and 2017-06-09 00:00:00 -> (-0.579 + (-0.396)) / 2 = -0.4875\n        Similarly for each hour.\n\n     Then, we repeat this averaged day for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 12. Why 4 days? Because we need 96 hours and 24*4=96.\n\n 13. However, note that the last two days are not exactly the same. We can also consider using exponential smoothing to give more weight to the last day? \n     But the problem does not specify the method.\n\n 14. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete answer, we will use the average of the last two days for each hour and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 15. Calculate the average for each hour of the day (over 2017-06-08 and 2017-06-09):\n\n     Hour 00:00: ( -0.579 + (-0.396) ) / 2 = -0.4875\n     Hour 01:00: ( -0.518 + (-0.518) ) / 2 = -0.518\n     Hour 02:00: ( -0.487 + (-0.487) ) / 2 = -0.487\n     Hour 03:00: ( -0.579 + (-0.487) ) / 2 = -0.533\n     Hour 04:00: ( -0.457 + (-0.609) ) / 2 = -0.533\n     Hour 05:00: ( -0.426 + (-0.518) ) / 2 = -0.472\n     Hour 06:00: ( -0.335 + (-0.426) ) / 2 = -0.3805\n     Hour 07:00: ( -0.213 + (-0.183) ) / 2 = -0.198\n     Hour 08:00: ( -0.091 + (-0.152) ) / 2 = -0.1215\n     Hour 09:00: ( -0.335 + (-0.152) ) / 2 = -0.2435\n     Hour 10:00: ( -0.122 + (-0.305) ) / 2 = -0.2135\n     Hour 11:00: ( -0.426 + (-0.366) ) / 2 = -0.396\n     Hour 12:00: ( -0.396 + (-0.305) ) / 2 = -0.3505\n     Hour 13:00: ( -0.518 + (-0.396) ) / 2 = -0.457\n     Hour 14:00: ( -0.396 + (-0.396) ) / 2 = -0.396\n     Hour 15:00: ( -0.457 + (-0.335) ) / 2 = -0.396\n     Hour 16:00: ( -0.305 + (-0.426) ) / 2 = -0.3655\n     Hour 17:00: ( -0.457 + (-0.457) ) / 2 = -0.457\n     Hour 18:00: ( -0.518 + (-0.518) ) / 2 = -0.518\n     Hour 19:00: ( -0.518 + (-0.548) ) / 2 = -0.533\n     Hour 20:00: ( -0.457 + (-0.487) ) / 2 = -0.472\n     Hour 21:00: ( -0.396 + (-0.518) ) / 2 = -0.457\n     Hour 22:00: ( -0.457 + (-0.457) ) / 2 = -0.457\n     Hour 23:00: ( -0.457 + (-0.518) ) / 2 = -0.4875\n\n 16. Now, we create 4 days of forecast (from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) by repeating the above 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 17. Format the answer as per requirement.\n\n 18. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 19. Let's create the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-06-10 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-06-09 23:00:00)\n     Then 2017-06-10 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-13 23:00:00.\n\n 20. We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n 21. Example for the first day (2017-06-10):\n\n     2017-06-10 00:00:00  -0.488   (rounded from -0.4875)\n     2017-06-10 01:00:00  -0.518\n     2017-06-10 02:00:00  -0.487\n     2017-06-10 03:00:00  -0.533\n     ... and so on.\n\n 22. We'll generate 4 days by repeating the same 24 hours 4 times.\n\n 23. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? However, we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 24. We output the entire 96 rows.\n\n 25. However, we must note: this is a very simplistic approach. In practice, one would use a more sophisticated model and handle the potential change point. \n     But given the constraints, we use this method.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n",
