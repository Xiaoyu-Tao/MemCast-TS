        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, for forecasting, we will use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n 3. We observe that the data has a daily pattern (diurnal variation). For example, temperatures tend to be lower at night and higher during the day.\n\n 4. We can use a model that accounts for seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 (since hourly data and daily pattern).\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need for 96-step ahead forecast, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model, which can capture both non-seasonal and seasonal patterns.\n    - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters).\n\n 6. However, note that the data shows a drop on 2017-08-25 16:00:00 (to 13.296) and then recovers. This might be an anomaly or a special event.\n\n 7. We must be cautious because the data is only 4 days. We might not have enough data to capture weekly patterns, but we are only forecasting 4 days ahead.\n\n 8. We will use the following approach:\n    - Preprocess: Check for missing values? In the given 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n    - Model Selection: We'll use SARIMA. We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24).\n\n 9. How to choose parameters?\n    - We can use auto_arima from pmdarima to find the best parameters? But we are not run code, so we have to use our expertise.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simple model that has worked well for similar problems: \n     - We note that the series has a clear daily pattern and some level of non-stationarity (mean changes over time). \n     - We can try: \n         d = 1 (to remove trend) and D = 1 (for seasonal differencing) with period 24.\n     - For non-seasonal part: p=0, q=1? and seasonal part: P=0, Q=1? \n\n 11. However, without running an automatic method, we have to rely on a standard approach. Since the data is small, we can also consider using a naive method? \n     But the problem requires an expert.\n\n 12. We can also consider using a rolling window of the last 24 hours to predict the next 24 hours? But that would be naive.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to generate 96 points, we will use a simple forecasting method that captures seasonality: \n     - We can compute the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the last known level.\n\n 14. Steps for the average daily pattern method:\n      a. Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n      b. We have 4 days, so we can take the average for each hour.\n      c. Then, we can use the last day (2017-08-28) as a base and then add the average pattern? \n      d. But note: the data might have a trend? We can detrend by the average of the day? \n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-28) and then for each hour in the next day, we take the value from the same hour in the previous day and adjust by the difference between the last day and the day before? \n\n 16. We can use a seasonal naive method: \n        y_{t+24} = y_{t}\n     but that would just repeat the last day for the next day? \n\n 17. However, we have 4 days and we can see that the pattern is not exactly the same. \n\n 18. Considering the above, we will use a method that takes the average of the last 4 days for each hour and then projects that forward. \n\n 19. Steps:\n      - Create a matrix of 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours). \n      - The data we have: \n          Day1: 2017-08-25 (00:00 to 23:00) -> 24 points\n          Day2: 2017-08-26\n          Day3: 2017-08-27\n          Day4: 2017-08-28\n\n      - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (2017-08-29 to 2017-09-01), we will use the average pattern for each day? \n\n      - But note: the data might have a trend? We can adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n 20. How to adjust?\n      Let the average for hour h be `avg_h`.\n      Let the last_day (2017-08-28) have values for each hour: `last_day_h`\n      The overall average of the last day: `last_day_avg = mean(last_day_h for h in 0..23)`\n      The overall average of the entire 4 days for the same hour? Actually, we can compute the overall average of the entire 4 days: `total_avg = mean(all 96 points)`\n\n      Then, we can set the forecast for hour h on the next day as:\n          forecast_h = avg_h + (last_day_avg - total_avg)\n\n      But this might not capture the trend.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 24 hours and then adjust the average pattern by the ratio or difference? \n\n 22. We can also consider a simple moving average of the last 24 hours and then use the daily pattern as a multiplicative factor? \n\n 23. Given the time and simplicity, we will use the average daily pattern without adjustment? \n\n 24. However, we note that the temperature on 2017-08-28 is generally higher than the previous days? \n\n 25. We can compute the daily average for each day:\n        Day1 (2017-08-25): 16.27 (approx)\n        Day2 (2017-08-26): 13.20 (approx)\n        Day3 (2017-08-27): 17.20 (approx)\n        Day4 (2017-08-28): 18.20 (approx)\n\n     There is an increasing trend? But then again, we have only 4 days and the last day is the highest.\n\n 26. We can use the average daily pattern and then shift it by the difference between the last day's average and the overall average? \n\n 27. Let:\n        overall_avg = (16.27 + 13.20 + 17.20 + 18.20) / 4 = 16.2175\n\n        For each hour h, we have the average `avg_h` over the 4 days.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h on the next day (2017-08-29) is:\n            forecast_h = avg_h + (last_day_avg - overall_avg)\n\n        But then for the next day (2017-08-30), we might do the same? But we don't have a new last_day_avg.\n\n 28. Alternatively, we can assume that the level of the last day is the new base? Then we can compute the relative pattern of each hour compared to the daily average of the 4 days? \n\n        Let `relative_h = avg_h - overall_avg`\n\n        Then for the next day (2017-08-29), we set:\n            forecast_h = last_day_avg + relative_h\n\n        Similarly, for the next days, we can use the same relative pattern? \n\n 29. But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We don't have any new information. So we will use the same pattern for all 4 days? \n\n 30. This method will give the same pattern for each day, but the level is set by the last day's average. \n\n 31. Steps to compute:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the overall average of the entire 96 points: total_avg.\n        Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days: avg_h.\n        Step 3: Compute the relative pattern: relative_h = avg_h - total_avg.\n\n        Step 4: Compute the average of the last day (2017-08-28): last_day_avg.\n\n        Step 5: For the next 4 days (96 hours), for each hour h (0 to 23) in each day, set:\n                forecast = last_day_avg + relative_h\n\n        This will give a constant pattern for each day, and the level is fixed at last_day_avg.\n\n 32. However, we might want to account for a possible trend? We can also project the trend? \n\n        We have 4 daily averages: [16.27, 13.20, 17.20, 18.20]\n\n        We can fit a linear regression to these 4 points to get a trend? \n\n        Let day index: 0,1,2,3 for the 4 days.\n\n        Then for the next days (day index 4,5,6,7) we can project the daily average.\n\n        Then for each hour in a particular day, we would do:\n            daily_avg = intercept + slope * (day_index)\n            forecast_h = daily_avg + relative_h\n\n 33. We'll do:\n\n        daily_avgs = [16.27, 13.20, 17.20, 18.20]\n\n        We can compute the linear trend: \n            x = [0,1,2,3]\n            y = [16.27, 13.20, 17.20, 18.20]\n\n        We can use numpy.polyfit? But we are not running code. We can do by hand:\n\n        n = 4\n        sum_x = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n        sum_y = 16.27+13.20+17.20+18.20 = 64.87\n        sum_xy = 0*16.27 + 1*13.20 + 2*17.20 + 3*18.20 = 0 + 13.20 + 34.40 + 54.60 = 102.2\n        sum_x2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n        slope b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n               = (4*102.2 - 6*64.87) / (4*14 - 36)\n               = (408.8 - 389.22) / (56 - 36)\n               = 19.58 / 20 = 0.979\n\n        intercept a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n\n                   = (64.87 - 0.979*6) / 4\n                   = (64.87 - 5.874) / 4\n                   = 58.996 / 4 = 14.749\n\n        Then for day index 4 (2017-08-29): daily_avg = 14.749 + 0.979*4 = 14.749 + 3.916 = 18.665\n        day index 5: 14.749 + 0.979*5 = 14.749 + 4.895 = 19.644\n        day index 6: 14.749 + 0.979*6 = 14.749 + 5.874 = 20.623\n        day index 7: 14.749 + 0.979*7 = 14.749 + 6.853 = 21.602\n\n        But note: the trend is increasing, but the daily averages we have are: 16.27, 13.20, 17.20, 18.20 -> the trend line might be overfitting? \n\n        The R^2: \n            total sum of squares: \n                mean_y = 64.87/4 = 16.2175\n                SST = (16.27-16.2175)^2 + (13.20-16.2175)^2 + (17.20-16.2175)^2 + (18.20-16.2175)^2\n                     = (0.0525)^2 + (-3.0175)^2 + (0.9825)^2 + (1.9825)^2\n                     = 0.00275625 + 9.10530625 + 0.96530625 + 3.93030625 = 14.003675\n\n            SSR = (predicted_y - mean_y)^2 for each point? Actually, we need the regression sum of squares? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the trend but note that the day2 (index1) is 13.20 which is an outlier? \n\n 34. Given the volatility and the fact that we are only forecasting 4 days, we might avoid projecting the trend too far? \n\n 35. We can use a moving average of the last two days? \n\n        For the next day (2017-08-29): use the average of day3 and day4: (17.20+18.20)/2 = 17.70\n\n        Then for 2017-08-30: use the average of day4 and the forecasted day? but we don't have it.\n\n 36. Considering the above, we decide to use the average of the last two days (day3 and day4) as the base level for the next 4 days? \n\n        base_level = (17.20 + 18.20) / 2 = 17.70\n\n        Then for each hour h in the next 4 days, we set:\n            forecast_h = base_level + relative_h\n\n        But note: the relative_h was computed from the 4-day average. \n\n 37. However, we must compute the relative_h as the deviation from the overall average? \n\n        Let total_avg = 16.2175 (as above)\n\n        Then for hour h, the relative_h = avg_h - total_avg.\n\n        Then forecast_h = base_level + (avg_h - total_avg)\n\n 38. But note: base_level is 17.70, and total_avg is 16.2175, so we are shifting the pattern by (17.70 - 16.2175) = 1.4825? \n\n        Then forecast_h = avg_h + 1.4825\n\n 39. This method: we are taking the average pattern and then shifting it by the difference between the base_level and the total_avg.\n\n 40. Let's compute the average for each hour (avg_h) and then add 1.4825 to get the forecast for that hour.\n\n 41. Then we repeat the same pattern for 4 days.\n\n 42. Steps:\n\n        a. Compute the total average of the entire 96 points: total_avg.\n        b. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days: avg_h.\n        c. base_level = (average of day3 + average of day4) / 2 = (17.20+18.20)/2 = 17.70\n        d. shift = base_level - total_avg = 17.70 - 16.2175 = 1.4825\n        e.

Then for each hour h in the next 4 days, the forecast = avg_h (from above) + shift\n\n        For example, hour0: 15.08925 + 0.72546875 = 15.81471875\n hour1: 15.1595 + 0.72546875 = 15.88496875\n ... and so on.\n\n 48. We will have 24 values for one day. Then we repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days? \n\n 49. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting without any new data, so we assume the pattern repeats.\n\n 50. We generate 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n 51. The dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-29 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-08-28 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-08-29 01:00:00 ... until 2017-09-01 23:00:00.\n\n 52. We'll create the data:\n\n        date, OT\n        2017-08-29 00:00:00, 15.81471875\n        2017-08-29 01:00:00, 15.88496875\n        ... for all 24 hours of 2017-08-29\n        then 2017-08-30 00:00:00, 15.81471875 (same as 2017-08-29 00:00:00)\n        ... and so on.\n\n 53. However, note that the pattern might not be exactly the same every day? But we are using the average pattern.\n\n 54. We'll round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places.\n\n 55. Let's do the computation for the first few:\n\n        hour0: 15.08925 + 0.72546875 = 15.81471875 -> 15.815\n        hour1: 15.1595 + 0.72546875 = 15.88496875 -> 15.885\n\n 56. But note: the original data had up to 6 decimals? but we see they are rounded to 3. So we output 3 decimals.\n\n 57. We'll generate the entire 96 points.\n\n 58. However, note: the method is very simple and does not account for any autocorrelation beyond the daily pattern. \n\n 59. But given the constraints, we proceed.\n\n 60. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 61. We must not omit any content.\n\n 62. We create a list:\n\n        date from 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 2017-09-01 23:00:00, and the OT values.\n\n 63. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-29 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2017-08-29 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Then 2017-08-30 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-08-31 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-01 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 96 hours.\n\n 64. The OT values for each day are the same: the 24 values we computed (avg_h + shift) for h=0 to 23.\n\n 65.

But note: we computed the averages with more precision, so we'll use the precise computation and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 67. We do:\n\n        hour0: 15.08925 + 0.72546875 = 15.81471875 -> 15.815\n        hour1: 15.1595 + 0.72546875 = 15.88496875 -> 15.885\n        hour2: 15.1245 + 0.72546875 = 15.84996875 -> 15.850\n        hour3: 14.86075 + 0.72546875 = 15.58621875 -> 15.586\n        hour4: 14.70275 + 0.72546875 = 15.42821875 -> 15.428\n        hour5: 14.73775 + 0.72546875 = 15.46321875 -> 15.463\n        hour6: 14.509 + 0.72546875 = 15.23446875 -> 15.234\n        hour7: 15.35325 + 0.72546875 = 16.07871875 -> 16.079\n        hour8: 15.7755 + 0.72546875 = 16.50096875 -> 16.501\n        hour9: 16.44375 + 0.72546875 = 17.16921875 -> 17.169\n        hour10: 16.989 + 0.72546875 = 17.71446875 -> 17.714\n        hour11: 16.90075 + 0.72546875 = 17.62621875 -> 17.626\n        hour12: 17.00625 + 0.72546875 = 17.73171875 -> 17.732\n        hour13: 16.848 + 0.72546875 = 17.57346875 -> 17.573\n        hour14: 17.90325 + 0.72546875 = 18.62871875 -> 18.629\n        hour15: 18.18475 + 0.72546875 = 18.91021875 -> 18.910\n        hour16: 17.21775 + 0.72546875 = 17.94321875 -> 17.943\n        hour17: 17.93875 + 0.72546875 = 18.66421875 -> 18.664\n        hour18: 16.23275 + 0.72546875 = 16.95821875 -> 16.958\n        hour19: 15.38825 + 0.72546875 = 16.11371875 -> 16.114\n        hour20: 15.0715 + 0.72546875 = 15.79696875 -> 15.797\n        hour21: 15.00125 + 0.72546875 = 15.72671875 -> 15.727\n        hour22: 15.15975 + 0.72546875 = 15.88521875 -> 15.885\n        hour23: 14.77275 + 0.72546875 = 15.49821875 -> 15.498\n\n 68. Now, we write the data for 4 days: each day the same 24 values.\n\n 69. We output:\n\n        2017-08-29 00:00:00,15.815\n        2017-08-29 01:00:00,15.885\n        2017-08-29 02:00:00,15.850\n        ... until 2017-09-01 70. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places? Actually, the original data had up to 6 decimal places but we rounded to 3. We'll output 3.\n\n 71. We write the answer in the format.\n\n 72. However, note: the method is very simplistic. But given the constraints, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 73. We output the complete 96 points.\n\n 74. Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n 75. We note: the dates must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 76. We generate:\n\n        for day in [29,30,31] of August and 1 of September (2017):\n\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n\n            if day==29,30,31: month=08, and day=29,30,31\n            then day=1: month=09, day=01\n\n 77. We write:\n\n        from 2017-08-29 to 2017-09-01.\n\n 78. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        dates = []\n        start = datetime(2017,8,29,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date_str = start.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n            start += timedelta(hours=1)\n\n 79. But we are not running code, so we write manually? We can do:\n\n        day1: 2017-08-29 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        day2: 2017-08-30 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        day3: 2017-08-31 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        day4: 2017-09-01 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 80. The OT values for each day are the same 24 numbers.\n\n 81. We write the answer.\n\n 82. Note: We must not omit any content.\n\n 83.
