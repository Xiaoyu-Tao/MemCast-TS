        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided 96 points do not have any missing values in the given snippet, but the problem states that the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. So for forecasting, we'll assume the provided data is complete for the past 96 hours.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting 4 days ahead.\n\n 3. We must be cautious: the data shows a daily pattern (diurnal variation) and possibly weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern might not be evident.\n\n 4. We can use a time series model. Given the short history (only 96 points) and the need for 96 points, we might use a model that can capture seasonality. Since the seasonality is daily (24 hours), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. We note that the data has some negative values and fluctuations.\n\n 6. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 7. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 96 points (next 4 days). This is a long forecast horizon relative to the history.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual, then forecast each component. But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we can use a naive seasonal model: for each hour of the day, we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days. But note that the data might have a stable pattern? We see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it 4 times? But that would ignore any trend and the fact that the pattern might change.\n\n 11. We can try to use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the seasonal pattern.\n\n 12. However, the problem says there might be missing values in the data? But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n 13. We decide to use a simple average by hour of day for the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? But the trend over 4 days is not clear.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a linear model with time and hour dummies. But with only 4 days, we have 4 observations per hour, which is very few.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we can use a model that is robust for short time series.\n\n 16. We choose to use the Seasonal Naive method: the forecast for each hour in the next day is the value of the same hour in the last day. Then we repeat for 4 days? But that would be repeating the last day 4 times.\n\n 17. However, we note that the last day (2017-08-04) has a pattern that is different from the previous days? Let's look at the last day:\n\n        2017-08-04 00:00:00  12.726000\n        2017-08-04 01:00:00  11.052000\n        2017-08-04 02:00:00  12.458000\n        2017-08-04 03:00:00  11.989000\n        2017-08-04 04:00:00  11.454000\n        2017-08-04 05:00:00  10.918000\n        2017-08-04 06:00:00  11.788000\n        2017-08-04 07:00:00   8.975000\n        2017-08-04 08:00:00   4.555000\n        2017-08-04 09:00:00  -1.474000\n        2017-08-04 10:00:00  -3.483000\n        2017-08-04 11:00:00  -5.559000\n        2017-08-04 12:00:00  -5.760000\n        2017-08-04 13:00:00   2.679000\n        2017-08-04 14:00:00  -4.890000\n        2017-08-04 15:00:00  10.516000\n        2017-08-04 16:00:00   0.335000\n        2017-08-04 17:00:00   5.224000\n        2017-08-04 18:00:00   9.444000\n        2017-08-04 19:00:00  12.860000\n        2017-08-04 20:00:00  18.084999\n        2017-08-04 21:00:00  17.816999\n        2017-08-04 22:00:00  16.142000\n        2017-08-04 23:00:00  16.410000\n\n 18. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any missing values in the provided 96, but we are to forecast the next 96. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96.\n\n 19. We decide to use a model that can handle the seasonality and short history. We'll use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) with additive seasonality. The seasonality period is 24.\n\n 20. However, with only 4 seasons (4 days) of data, the seasonal parameters might be hard to estimate. But we can try.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: average the same hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days. This is a simple seasonal average model.\n\n 22. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (18.552999 + 14.200000 + 15.405000 + 12.726000) / 4 = (18.553 + 14.2 + 15.405 + 12.726) / 4 = 60.884/4 = 15.221\n        hour1: (17.013 + 12.190 + 13.329 + 11.052) / 4 = (17.013+12.19+13.329+11.052) = 53.584/4 = 13.396\n        ... and so on.\n\n 23. Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-08-05 to 2017-08-08), we would use the same 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n 24. But note: the data shows a possible increasing trend? Let's see the overall average:\n\n        Day1: average of 24 hours: we can compute roughly: \n          Day1: from 18.55 down to 12.12 -> average around 10? \n          Day2: from 14.2 to 13.66 -> average around 8?\n          Day3: from 15.4 to 10.78 -> average around 8?\n          Day4: from 12.72 to 16.41 -> average around 8.5?\n\n        It's not clear. The last day has higher values in the evening.\n\n 25. Given the short history, we might not capture a trend. Therefore, the average by hour might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 26. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours from the 4 days and then assign:\n\n        For 2017-08-05 00:00:00: average of hour0\n        For 2017-08-05 01:00:00: average of hour1\n        ... until 2017-08-08 23:00:00: average of hour23 (repeated for each day)\n\n 27. Steps to compute:\n\n        Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n 28. We'll write a small code in our mind to compute the 24 averages.\n\n 29. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values? We don't have any in the provided 96, so we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n 30. We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [18.552999, 14.200000, 15.405000, 12.726000] -> mean = (18.553+14.2+15.405+12.726)/4 = 60.884/4 = 15.221\n        hour1: [17.013, 12.190, 13.329, 11.052] -> 53.584/4 = 13.396\n        hour2: [15.137, 12.592, 13.597, 12.458] -> 53.784/4 = 13.446\n        hour3: [13.396, 10.516, 12.056, 11.989] -> 47.957/4 = 11.98925\n        hour4: [13.530, 11.588, 14.200, 11.454] -> 50.772/4 = 12.693\n        hour5: [12.391, 10.315, 13.329, 10.918] -> 46.953/4 = 11.73825\n        hour6: [11.588, 10.851, 13.463, 11.788] -> 47.69/4 = 11.9225\n        hour7: [5.559, 7.904, 12.391, 8.975] -> 34.829/4 = 8.70725\n        hour8: [5.626, 5.291, 6.497, 4.555] -> 21.969/4 = 5.49225\n        hour9: [3.416, 3.014, 8.841, -1.474] -> 13.797/4 = 3.44925\n        hour10: [6.363, 2.612, -1.474, -3.483] -> 4.018/4 = 1.0045\n        hour11: [-2.277, 2.009, -0.067, -5.559] -> -5.894/4 = -1.4735\n        hour12: [-4.555, 2.545, -4.756, -5.760] -> -12.526/4 = -3.1315\n        hour13: [-8.975, 2.679, -14.669, 2.679] -> (-8.975+2.679-14.669+2.679) = (-8.975-14.669) + (2.679+2.679) = -23.644 + 5.358 = -18.286/4 = -4.5715\n        hour14: [3.282, 5.090, -10.784, -4.890] -> (3.282+5.090-10.784-4.890) = (8.372 - 15.674) = -7.302/4 = -1.8255\n        hour15: [6.765, 1.474, -7.234, 10.516] -> (6.765+1.474-7.234+10.516) = (8.239 + 3.282) = 11.521/4 = 2.88025\n        hour16: [7.904, 5.224, 2.009, 0.335] -> 15.472/4 = 3.868\n        hour17: [6.363, 8.975, 6.832, 5.224] -> 27.394/4 = 6.8485\n        hour18: [8.640, 8.975, 7.569, 9.444] -> 34.628/4 = 8.657\n        hour19: [9.913, 10.047, 9.042, 12.860] -> 41.862/4 = 10.4655\n        hour20: [14.803, 11.052, 12.190, 18.084999] -> (14.803+11.052+12.190+18.085) = 56.13/4 = 14.0325\n        hour21: [13.798, 10.181, 10.851, 17.816999] -> (13.798+10.181+10.851+17.817) = 52.647/4 = 13.16175\n        hour22: [13.530, 12.324, 10.449, 16.142] -> 52.445/4 = 13.11125\n        hour23: [12.123, 13.664, 10.784, 16.410] -> 52.981/4 = 13.24525\n\n 31. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-08-05): \n            00:00:00 -> 15.221\n            01:00:00 -> 13.396\n            02:00:00 -> 13.446\n            ... until hour23: 13.24525\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 32. But note: the last day (2017-08-04) had a higher peak in the evening. The average might smooth that. However, without more data, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 33. We'll output the dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-05 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-08-08 23:00:00\n\n        We generate the datetime sequence: 96 hours starting from 2017-08-05 00:00:00.\n\n 34. Format: \n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-08-05 00:00:00  <value>\n        2017-08-05 01:00:00  <value>\n        ... \n        ```\n\n 35. We'll write the 24 averages and then repeat the same 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 36. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. We are not given any missing values in the next 96? We are to generate without missing.\n\n 37. We output the 96 values as computed.\n\n 38. Let's list the 24 average values:\n\n        hour0: 15.221\n        hour1: 13.396\n        hour2: 13.446\n        hour3: 11.98925\n        hour4: 12.693\n        hour5: 11.73825\n        hour6: 11.9225\n        hour7: 8.70725\n        hour8: 5.49225\n        hour9: 3.44925\n        hour10: 1.0045\n        hour11: -1.4735\n        hour12: -3.1315\n        hour13: -4.5715\n        hour14: -1.8255\n        hour15: 2.88025\n        hour16: 3.868\n        hour17: 6.8485\n        hour18: 8.657\n        hour19: 10.4655\n        hour20: 14.0325\n        hour21: 13.16175\n        hour22: 13.11125\n        hour23: 13.24525\n\n 39. We'll write the same 24 values for 4 consecutive days.\n\n 40. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 41. Note: We are rounding to 6 decimal places as in the input? The input had 6 decimal places. We'll keep the same precision.\n\n 42. However, note that the input had 6 decimal places but the numbers were like 18.552999, which is 6 decimal places. We'll output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 43. We write the data:\n\n        First day (2017-08-05):\n            00:00:00  15.221000\n            01:00:00  13.396000\n            02:00:00  13.446000\n            03:00:00  11.989250\n            04:00:00  12.693000\n            05:00:00  11.738250\n            06:00:00  11.922500\n            07:00:00   8.707250\n            08:00:00   5.492250\n            09:00:00   3.449250\n            10:00:00   1.004500\n            11:00:00  -1.473500\n            12:00:00  -3.131500\n            13:00:00  -4.571500\n            14:00:00  -1.825500\n            15:00:00   2.880250\n            16:00:00   3.868000\n            17:00:00   6.848500\n            18:00:00   8.657000\n            19:00:00  10.465500\n            20:00:00  14.032500\n            21:00:00  13.161750\n            22:00:00  13.111250\n            23:00:00  13.245250\n\n        Then the same for 2017-08-06, 2017-08-07, 2017-08-08.\n\n 44. We note that the average method does not capture the trend, but with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 45. We output the data.\n\n 46. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" So we output 96 rows.\n\n 47. We write the answer in the required format.\n",
