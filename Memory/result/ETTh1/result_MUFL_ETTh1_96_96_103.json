        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some irregularities and missing values? \n    However, the provided 96 points (4 days) do not have any missing values in the given snippet.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly data and the apparent daily seasonality, we can use a seasonal time series model.\n\n 3. Given the constraints of the problem and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 forecasted values, we choose a method that can handle seasonality and is robust to the data pattern.\n\n 4. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, without the ability to run extensive model selection, we can use a simple but effective method: \n    - We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24 hours). We can compute the average pattern for the 4 days and then adjust for any trend or level change.\n\n 5. But note: the data shows some non-stationarity (the level changes from day to day) and also the pattern within a day is not exactly the same.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n    - The forecast for the next 24 hours (day 5) is the same as the last 24 hours (day 4) but adjusted by the average change between consecutive days? \n    - However, we have 4 days. We can compute the average day and then use the last day's pattern with a drift.\n\n 7. Considering the complexity and the fact that we are to generate 96 points without missing values, we can use a simple average of the last two days for the next day? \n\n 8. But note: the data from 2017-08-20 (the last day) has some unusual patterns (e.g., at 10:00: 5.686, then 3.767 at 11:00, then -2.132 at 12:00, etc.) and the previous days also show variability.\n\n 9. We are not given any external variables (like temperature, holidays, etc.), so we rely on the time series pattern.\n\n10. Approach:\n    - We can use a seasonal naive forecast: each hour in the next day is the same as the same hour in the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n    - However, the level of the time series is changing. We can compute the average of the last 4 days for each hour and then adjust by the overall trend.\n\n11. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-20) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day to the next for each hour? \n\n12. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days (96 hours), we can do:\n\n    Let H = 24 hours in a day.\n\n    We have 4 days: day1 (2017-08-17), day2 (2018-08-18), day3 (2017-08-19), day4 (2017-08-20).\n\n    We can compute the average daily pattern:\n\n        avg_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4   for h in 0..23\n\n    But this would ignore the trend. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where recent days are more important.\n\n13. However, the data shows a possible increasing trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n    Day1: average = (sum of 24 values of day1)/24\n    Day2: similarly\n    Day3: \n    Day4:\n\n    Without computing exactly, we can see that the values on day4 are generally lower than day1? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last 4 days and then project a linear trend for the next 4 days? \n\n14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set, we choose a simple method:\n\n    We will use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days? \n\n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So:\n\n        For hour 0: \n            forecast for 2017-08-21 00:00:00 = (9.523 + 12.864 + 11.691 + 5.508) / 4\n        For hour 1:\n            forecast for 2017-08-21 01:00:00 = (9.737 + 12.011 + 12.117 + 1.208) / 4\n\n    and so on.\n\n    However, this would repeat the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days? Actually, we are forecasting 4 days, so we would use the same 24-hour pattern for each of the 4 days? \n\n    But that would be the same for each day? We need 4 different days. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average daily pattern and then adjust by a daily trend? \n\n15. We can compute the daily average for each day:\n\n        day1_avg = average of the 24 hours on day1\n        day2_avg = ... \n\n    Then we can compute the trend in the daily averages. \n\n    Let:\n\n        day1_avg = d1\n        day2_avg = d2\n        day3_avg = d3\n        day4_avg = d4\n\n    Then the trend per day: \n        slope = (d4 - d1) / 3   (because 3 intervals between 4 points)\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8), the daily average would be:\n\n        d5 = d4 + slope\n        d6 = d4 + 2*slope\n        d7 = d4 + 3*slope\n        d8 = d4 + 4*slope\n\n    Then for each hour h in [0,23] of the day, we compute:\n\n        base_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4   [the average pattern]\n\n        Then for day5 (first forecast day) at hour h: \n            forecast = base_h + (d5 - overall_avg)\n\n        where overall_avg = (d1+d2+d3+d4)/4\n\n    This method is called \"deseasonalizing and then adding the trend\".\n\n16. Steps in detail:\n\n    a) Compute the daily averages for the 4 days:\n\n        day1: 2017-08-17: d1 = mean of [9.523, 10.234] (24 values)\n        day2: 2017-08-18: d2\n        day3: 2017-08-19: d3\n        day4: 2017-08-20: d4\n\n    b) Compute the overall average of the 4 days: overall_avg = (d1+d2+d3+d4)/4\n\n    c) Compute the slope: slope = (d4 - d1) / 3   [because from day1 to day4 is 3 days apart? Actually, the time between day1 and day4 is 3 days?]\n\n        But note: we have 4 points, so the linear regression would be:\n\n        Let x = [0,1,2,3] for day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n        Then slope = [ (0*d1 + 1*d2 + 2*d3 + 3*d4) - (0+1+2+3)*(d1+d2+d3+d4)/4 ] / [ (0^2+1^2+2^2+3^2) - (0+1+2+3)^2/4 ]\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a simple endpoint method: slope = (d4 - d1) / 3.\n\n    d) For each hour h (0 to 23), compute the average seasonal component:\n\n        base_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n    e) Then for the next 4 days (day5 to day8) and for each hour h:\n\n        day5 (2017-08-21): \n            daily_avg5 = d4 + slope\n            forecast_h = base_h + (daily_avg5 - overall_avg)\n\n        day6 (2017-08-22):\n            daily_avg6 = d4 + 2*slope\n            forecast_h = base_h + (daily_avg6 - overall_avg)\n\n        day7 (2017-08-23):\n            daily_avg7 = d4 + 3*slope\n            forecast_h = base_h + (daily_avg7 - overall_avg)\n\n        day8 (2017-08-24):\n            daily_avg8 = d4 + 4*slope\n            forecast_h = base_h + (daily_avg8 - overall_avg)\n\n    This adjusts the base pattern by the deviation of the day's average from the overall average.\n\n17. However, note: the data might have a strong seasonality and the trend might not be linear. But with only 4 days, we cannot do much.\n\n18.

But for simplicity, we use the endpoints:\n\n        slope = (d4 - d1) / 3 = (3.4365416666666665 - 1.2037916666666667) / 3 = (2.23275) / 3 = 0.74425\n\n    Then for the next 4 days:\n\n        d5 = d4 + slope = 3.4365416666666665 + 0.74425 = 4.180791666666667\n        d6 = d4 + 2*slope = 3.4365416666666665 + 1.4885 = 4.925041666666667\n        d7 = d4 + 3*slope = 3.4365416666666665 + 2.23275 = 5.669291666666667\n        d8 = d4 + 4*slope = 3.4365416666666665 + 2.977 = 6.413541666666667\n\n19. Now, we compute the base_h for each hour of the day (0 to 23) as the average of the 4 days at that hour.\n\n    For hour0 (00:00): \n        base0 = (9.523 (day1) + 12.864 (day2) + 11.691 (day3) + 5.508 (day4)) / 4 = (9.523+12.864+11.691+5.508)/4 = 39.586/4 = 9.8965\n\n    For hour1 (01:00):\n        base1 = (9.737+12.011+12.117+1.208)/4 = (9.737+12.011=21.748, +12.117=33.865, +1.208=35.073) -> 35.073/4 = 8.76825\n\n    ... and so on for all 24 hours.\n\n20. Then for the first forecast day (2017-08-21, day5) at hour0:\n        forecast0 = base0 + (d5 - overall_avg) = 9.8965 + (4.180791666666667 - 2.0209166666666666) \n                 = 9.8965 + 2.159875 = 12.056375\n\n    For the same day at hour1:\n        forecast1 = base1 + (d5 - overall_avg) = 8.76825 + 2.159875 = 10.928125\n\n    For the second forecast day (2017-08-22, day6) at hour0:\n        forecast0 = base0 + (d6 - overall_avg) = 9.8965 + (4.925041666666667 - 2.0209166666666666) \n                 = 9.8965 + 2.904125 = 12.800625\n\n    and so on.\n\n21. We must generate 96 data points (4 days * 24 hours). We'll compute the base_h for each hour (0-23) and then for each day in the forecast (day5 to day8) we add the corresponding daily adjustment (d5 - overall_avg, d6 - overall_avg, etc.)\n\n22. However, note: the base_h is the same for the same hour in each day? So we are essentially using the same daily pattern and shifting it by the daily level.\n\n23. Let's code this in steps:\n\n    Step 1: Precompute the base_h for h=0 to 23.\n\n    Step 2: Precompute the daily adjustments for the 4 days:\n        adj5 = d5 - overall_avg\n        adj6 = d6 - overall_avg\n        adj7 = d7 - overall_avg\n        adj8 = d8 - overall_avg\n\n    Step 3: For day5 (2017-08-21) and hour0 to hour23:\n        date = 2017-08-21 00:00:00, value = base0 + adj5\n        date = 2017-08-21 01:00:00, value = base1 + adj5\n        ... until 23:00: base23 + adj5\n\n    Step 2017-08-22: base0+adj6, base1+adj6, ... base23+adj6\n\n    Step 2017-08-23: base0+adj7, ... base23+adj7\n\n    Step 2017-08-24: base0+adj8, ... base23+adj8\n\n24. We must be cautious: the base_h is computed from the historical 4 days. And the adjustments are based on the daily level.\n\n25. Let's compute the base_h for all 24 hours:\n\n    We have the data:\n\n    Hour0: [9.523, 12.864, 11.691, 5.508] -> sum=39.586 -> base0=9.8965\n    Hour1: [9.737, 12.011, 12.117, 1.208] -> 9.737+12.011=21.748, 21.748+12.117=33.865, 33.865+1.208=35.073 -> base1=8.76825\n    Hour2: [8.955,10.554,11.549,2.025] -> 8.955+10.554=19.509, +11.549=31.058, +2.025=33.083 -> base2=8.27075\n    Hour3: [9.488,11.513,12.082,1.990] -> 9.488+11.513=21.001, +12.082=33.083, +1.990=35.073 -> base3=8.76825\n    Hour4: [9.452,11.655,11.691,2.843] -> 9.452+11.655=21.107, +11.691=32.798, +2.843=35.641 -> base4=8.91025\n    Hour5: [8.813,10.767,10.021,2.843] -> 8.813+10.767=19.58, +10.021=29.601, +2.843=32.444 -> base5=8.111\n    Hour6: [9.488,10.625,9.701,2.914] -> 9.488+10.625=20.113, +9.701=29.814, +2.914=32.728 -> base6=8.182\n    Hour7: [5.686,5.259,6.076,4.015] -> 5.686+5.259=10.945, +6.076=17.021, +4.015=21.036 -> base7=5.259\n    Hour8: [3.127,-1.670,2.132,3.696] -> 3.127-1.670=1.457, +2.132=3.589, +3.696=7.285 -> base8=1.82125\n    Hour9: [-8.138,-6.503,0.426,4.904] -> -8.138-6.503=-14.641, +0.426=-14.215, +4.904=-9.311 -> base9=-2.32775\n    Hour10: [-11.229,-11.229,-10.909,5.686] -> -11.229-11.229=-22.458, -10.909=-33.367, +5.686=-27.681 -> base10=-6.92025\n    Hour11: [-10.234,-14.001,-13.574,3.767] -> -10.234-14.001=-24.235, -13.574=-37.809, +3.767=-34.042 -> base11=-8.5105\n    Hour12: [-13.432,-16.346,-9.985,-2.132] -> -13.432-16.346=-29.778, -9.985=-39.763, -2.132=-41.895 -> base12=-10.47375\n    Hour13: [-14.143,-15.458,-4.335,4.264] -> -14.143-15.458=-29.601, -4.335=-33.936, +4.264=-29.672 -> base13=-7.418\n    Hour14: [-13.574,-13.219,-15.671,-12.331] -> -13.574-13.219=-26.793, -15.671=-42.464, -12.331=-54.795 -> base14=-13.69875\n    Hour15: [-11.407,-10.234,-8.315,-0.959] -> -11.407-10.234=-21.641, -8.315=-29.956, -0.959=-30.915 -> base15=-7.72875\n    Hour16: [-5.721,1.670,3.056,-0.640] -> -5.721+1.670=-4.051, +3.056= -0.995, -0.640=-1.635 -> base16=-0.40875\n    Hour17: [0.071,0.249,4.051,2.274] -> 0.071+0.249=0.32, +4.051=4.371, +2.274=6.645 -> base17=1.66125\n    Hour18: [2.843,4.762,4.797,5.863] -> 2.843+4.762=7.605, +4.797=12.402, +5.863=18.265 -> base18=4.56625\n    Hour19: [5.472,6.716,6.432,7.356] -> 5.472+6.716=12.188, +6.432=18.62, +7.356=25.976 -> base19=6.494\n    Hour20: [7.356,8.244,2.843,8.138] -> 7.356+8.244=15.6, +2.843=18.443, +8.138=26.581 -> base20=6.64525\n    Hour21: [8.031,8.315,3.482,7.640] -> 8.031+8.315=16.346, +3.482=19.828, +7.640=27.468 -> base21=6.867\n    Hour22: [8.493,9.772,4.939,10.376] -> 8.493+9.772=18.265, +4.939=23.204, +10.376=33.58 -> base22=8.395\n    Hour23: [10.234,9.808,6.219,11.229] -> 10.234+9.808=20.042, +6.219=26.261, +11.229=37.49 -> base23=9.3725\n\n26.
