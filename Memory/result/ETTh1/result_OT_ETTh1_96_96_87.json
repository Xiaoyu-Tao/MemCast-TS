        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we will assume the given data is complete and then forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the seasonality (daily pattern seems present), we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend (if any)\n    - Seasonality (with period 24 for daily seasonality in hourly data)\n    - Autocorrelation\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple days) and the data shows daily cycles, we see that temperatures rise during the day and fall at night.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or a machine learning model. However, without more context and due to the small data size (only 96 points for training),\n    we might use a simpler model that can capture seasonality.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: using the average of the same hour from the previous days. But we only have 4 days of data, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    However, note that the pattern might change and we don't have a long history.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the requirement for 96 points, we can use a model like Exponential Smoothing State Space Model with seasonality (ETS) or SARIMA.\n\n 7. We choose to use SARIMA because it is flexible and can model both non-seasonal and seasonal components.\n\n 8. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We have to set the seasonal period: 24 (for hourly data with daily seasonality).\n    - We need to determine the orders: (p,d,q) for non-seasonal and (P,D,Q,m) for seasonal with m=24.\n\n 9. We can also consider using an automated approach to select the best SARIMA model (like auto_arima from pmdarima in Python) but since we are not running code, we have to rely on a reasonable model.\n\n10. Looking at the data: \n    - There is a daily pattern: temperatures are lower at night and higher during the day.\n    - The data does not show a strong trend over the 4 days? Let's check the values: \n        The first day (2017-06-14) max is around 17.9, then 20.5 on 2017-06-15, 20.4 on 2017-06-16, and 20.9 on 2017-06-17. \n        There might be a slight upward trend? But then again, the last day (2017-06-17) ends at 17.0. So we might consider a stationary model.\n\n11. We can try a SARIMA model with:\n    - Non-seasonal: (p,d,q) = (1,0,1) or (0,0,0) or (1,0,0) etc.\n    - Seasonal: (P,D,Q) = (1,0,1,24) or (1,1,1,24) etc.\n\n12. However, without the ability to run model selection, we will use a standard approach: \n    - We note that the data might be stationary (no strong trend) so d=0 and D=0? But let's check: \n        The mean over the days: \n          Day1: average ~16.5, Day2: ~18.0, Day3: ~17.5, Day4: ~17.5 -> no strong trend? \n        We might set d=0 and D=0.\n\n13. We can try a simple model: SARIMA(1,0,0)(1,0,0,24). \n\n14. But note: we are to forecast 96 points and we must output the data. Since we cannot run the model here, we have to simulate the output.\n\n15. However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 points. We must generate 96 numbers.\n\n16. Given the constraints, we will generate a naive forecast: \n    We take the average of each hour over the 4 available days and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n    Steps for naive seasonal forecast:\n      - For hour 0 (00:00): average of [14.351, 17.024, 18.219, 16.039] -> (14.351+17.024+18.219+16.039)/4 = 16.40825\n      - For hour 1 (01:00): average of [14.351, 16.743, 17.375, 15.617] -> (14.351+16.743+17.375+15.617)/4 = 16.0215\n      - ... and so on for each of the 24 hours.\n\n    Then we repeat this 4 times (for the next 4 days).\n\n17. This method is simple and captures the daily seasonality. However, it ignores any trend and any other patterns. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We have 24 hours in a day and 4 days of data.\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values.\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00): [14.351, 17.024, 18.219, 16.039] -> (14.351+17.024+18.219+16.039)/4 = 16.40825\n    Hour 1 (01:00): [14.351, 16.743, 17.375, 15.617] -> (14.351+16.743+17.375+15.617)/4 = 16.0215\n    Hour 2 (02:00): [14.140, 16.743, 16.954, 15.125] -> (14.140+16.743+16.954+15.125)/4 = 15.7405\n    Hour 3 (03:00): [13.718, 16.391, 16.601, 15.054] -> (13.718+16.391+16.601+15.054)/4 = 15.441\n    Hour 4 (04:00): [14.140, 15.758, 17.165, 14.773] -> (14.140+15.758+17.165+14.773)/4 = 15.459\n    Hour 5 (05:00): [13.929, 15.758, 16.813, 14.351] -> (13.929+15.758+16.813+14.351)/4 = 15.21275\n    Hour 6 (06:00): [14.491, 16.108, 16.039, 14.632] -> (14.491+16.108+16.039+14.632)/4 = 15.3175\n    Hour 7 (07:00): [14.632, 16.954, 16.601, 15.054] -> (14.632+16.954+16.601+15.054)/4 = 15.81025\n    Hour 8 (08:00): [14.491, 17.726, 16.672, 16.039] -> (14.491+17.726+16.672+16.039)/4 = 16.232\n    Hour 9 (09:00): [15.195, 17.375, 16.461, 16.108] -> (15.195+17.375+16.461+16.108)/4 = 16.28475\n    Hour 10 (10:00): [15.336, 17.445, 17.305, 16.250] -> (15.336+17.445+17.305+16.250)/4 = 16.584\n    Hour 11 (11:00): [15.476, 17.938, 17.305, 17.305] -> (15.476+17.938+17.305+17.305)/4 = 17.006\n    Hour 12 (12:00): [16.108, 18.079, 17.445, 17.445] -> (16.108+18.079+17.445+17.445)/4 = 17.26925\n    Hour 13 (13:00): [16.743, 19.768, 17.516, 17.868] -> (16.743+19.768+17.516+17.868)/4 = 17.97375\n    Hour 14 (14:00): [17.024, 19.627, 18.712, 20.049] -> (17.024+19.627+18.712+20.049)/4 = 18.853\n    Hour 15 (15:00): [16.813, 20.330, 20.400, 20.962] -> (16.813+20.330+20.400+20.962)/4 = 19.62625\n    Hour 16 (16:00): [17.375, 20.541, 19.908, 20.330] -> (17.375+20.541+19.908+20.330)/4 = 19.5385\n    Hour 17 (17:00): [17.657, 20.190, 19.205, 19.556] -> (17.657+20.190+19.205+19.556)/4 = 19.152\n    Hour 18 (18:00): [17.938, 19.768, 19.768, 19.627] -> (17.938+19.768+19.768+19.627)/4 = 19.27525\n    Hour 19 (19:00): [17.798, 18.712, 18.500, 18.923] -> (17.798+18.712+18.500+18.923)/4 = 18.48325\n    Hour 20 (20:00): [17.024, 18.219, 17.587, 18.009] -> (17.024+18.219+17.587+18.009)/4 = 17.70975\n    Hour 21 (21:00): [17.165, 17.726, 17.305, 18.009] -> (17.165+17.726+17.305+18.009)/4 = 17.55125\n    Hour 22 (22:00): [17.305, 18.431, 16.813, 17.516] -> (17.305+18.431+16.813+17.516)/4 = 17.51625\n    Hour 23 (23:00): [16.743, 18.290, 16.039, 17.024] -> (16.743+18.290+16.039+17.024)/4 = 17.024\n\n19. Now, we create the next 96 hours (from 2017-06-18 00:00:00 to 2017-06-21 23:00:00) by repeating the above 24 averages for 4 days.\n\n20.

We must format the answer as per the required format.\n\n22. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n23.

But note: the last date in the input is 2017-06-17 23:00:00. The next 96 hours start at 2017-06-18 00:00:00 and go to 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n25. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n26. We write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'OT'\n\n27. We output the data in the required format.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n But we must be cautious: if we were to handle missing values in the input, we would have to impute them. Since the input is complete, we proceed.\n\n28. We output 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-06-18 00:00:00\n   Then increment by 1 hour until 2017-06-21 23:00:00.\n\n29. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n30. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n However, note: the averages we computed are approximate. We must round to 3 decimals.\n\n31.
