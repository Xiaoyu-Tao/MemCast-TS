        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). There might be weekly seasonality too, but we only have 4 days so we focus on daily.\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates does not have any missing values in the given sample.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method that can handle seasonality. Given the hourly data and the pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data has seasonality of 24, we can use a seasonal autoregressive model or exponential smoothing. However, with only 96 points, we have limited data.\n\n We choose to use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline? But note: the data shows a pattern that is not exactly repeating but has similarities.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA). But without automatic parameter tuning, it's challenging.\n\n However, note the instruction: we are an expert and must provide the forecast. We can use a simple method that captures the seasonality and the data shows:\n   - During the day (from 9:00 to 16:00) the load is negative (or low) and then increases in the evening and night.\n\n Since we are to forecast 4 days, we can assume the pattern repeats daily? But the provided 4 days are consecutive and show a similar pattern.\n\n We can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n How about:\n   For hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the 4 available days (if we had more, we could use more, but we have 4).\n\n But note: the data starts at 2017-03-06 (Monday) and ends at 2017-03-09 (Thursday). The next 4 days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? Actually:\n   2017-03-10: Friday\n   2017-03-11: Saturday\n   2017-03-12: Sunday\n   2017-03-13: Monday\n\n However, we don't have weekend data in the history? We only have Monday to Thursday. So the weekend might be different.\n\n But we have no choice because we don't have weekend data. So we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   Let H0 (hour 0): 00:00, H1: 01:00, ... H23: 23:00.\n\n   For each hour h in [0,23]:\n        value_h = ( value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h ) / 4\n\n   Then we use this value for each hour of the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (Thursday) as the pattern for Friday? But we don't know.\n\n   Since we don't have information about weekly seasonality and the data is only 4 days, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n   However, note that the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last few days:\n\n        Day1 (2017-03-06): \n        Day2 (2017-03-07): \n        Day3 (2017-03-08):\n        Day4 (2017-03-09):\n\n   We can also consider a moving average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n   But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can compute the average.\n\n   We'll create a table for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [13.262, 10.650, 11.588, 10.784] -> average = (13.262+10.650+11.588+10.784)/4 = 11.571\n        hour1: [14.535, 11.655, 10.315, 10.181] -> (14.535+11.655+10.315+10.181)/4 = 11.6715\n\n   and so on.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we assign:\n\n        2017-03-10 00:00:00: 11.571\n        2017-03-10 01:00:00: 11.6715\n        ... until 2017-03-10 23:00:00: [average for hour23]\n\n        then 2017-03-11 00:00:00: same as 2017-03-10 00:00:00? No, we use the same average for each day? \n        Actually, we are using the same set of averages for each day? \n\n   But note: the pattern might change on weekends? We don't have data. So we use the same average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   However, we can also consider a slight adjustment: if we see a trend over the 4 days, we might adjust. But the data doesn't show a clear upward or downward trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour and then for the next 4 days, we use that average for each day.\n\n   This is a simple and robust method.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (13.262 + 10.650 + 11.588 + 10.784) / 4 = 11.571\n        hour1: (14.535 + 11.655 + 10.315 + 10.181) / 4 = 11.6715\n        hour2: (11.922 + 10.717 + 9.645 + 8.707) / 4 = 10.24775\n        hour3: (14.066 + 10.985 + 9.511 + 8.774) / 4 = 10.834\n        hour4: (13.195 + 10.449 + 9.846 + 10.382) / 4 = 10.968\n        hour5: (15.807 + 11.387 + 9.578 + 9.377) / 4 = 11.53725\n        hour6: (12.525 + 10.717 + 10.181 + 10.315) / 4 = 10.9345\n        hour7: (13.999 + 11.855 + 10.985 + 10.248) / 4 = 11.77175\n        hour8: (8.640 + 11.253 + 5.090 + 4.890) / 4 = 7.46825\n        hour9: (1.139 + 8.640 + -0.469 + 0.335) / 4 = 2.41125\n        hour10: (-2.076 + 8.105 + -4.220 + -3.081) / 4 = -0.318\n        hour11: (-5.358 + -3.617 + -5.961 + -4.823) / 4 = -4.93975\n        hour12: (-8.707 + -9.377 + -9.712 + -8.908) / 4 = -9.176\n        hour13: (-7.569 + -6.631 + -8.105 + -6.631) / 4 = -7.234\n        hour14: (-6.430 + -6.028 + -6.698 + -2.813) / 4 = -5.49225\n        hour15: (-5.157 + -3.684 + -3.148 + -2.344) / 4 = -3.58325\n        hour16: (3.684 + -0.067 + -1.139 + 0.402) / 4 = 0.72\n        hour17: (6.899 + 5.224 + 5.023 + 5.626) / 4 = 5.693\n        hour18: (7.301 + 6.765 + 6.430 + 6.296) / 4 = 6.698\n        hour19: (7.837 + 7.502 + 7.636 + 7.435) / 4 = 7.6025\n        hour20: (7.301 + 7.033 + 6.966 + 7.234) / 4 = 7.1335\n        hour21: (8.038 + 5.827 + 6.430 + 6.363) / 4 = 6.6645\n        hour22: (8.774 + 6.698 + 6.363 + 6.899) / 4 = 7.1835\n        hour23: (9.980 + 8.372 + 8.239 + 10.516) / 4 = 9.27675\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n   So:\n        Day1: 2017-03-10: [11.571, 11.6715, 10.24775, ... , 9.27675]\n        Day2: 2017-03-11: same 24 values\n        Day3: 2017-03-12: same\n        Day4: 2017-03-13: same\n\n   But note: the last day of history is 2017-03-09 (Thursday) and the next day is 2017-03-10 (Friday). We are using the average of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday for Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? \n\n   This might not capture the weekend effect, but we don't have weekend data.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use the last 4 days without averaging? But that would be a naive forecast? \n\n   However, the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the forecast. We choose the average by hour as a simple and reasonable method.\n\n   We'll generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-10 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-03-13 23:00:00\n\n   We'll create the timestamps and the corresponding average value for that hour.\n\n   We note that the average values we computed for hour0 to hour23.\n\n   For the first day (2017-03-10, Friday):\n        hour0: 00:00:00 -> 11.571\n        hour1: 11.6715\n        ... \n        hour23: 9.27675\n\n   Then the second day (2017-03-11, Saturday): same 24 values\n   Third day (2017-03-12, Sunday): same\n   Fourth day (2017-03-13, Monday): same\n\n   We output the data in the same format.\n\n   However, note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are to forecast? But we are generating the forecast and we are to provide the next 96 without missing. So we output the 96 values.\n\n   We must output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        date, HUFL\n        2017-03-10 00:00:00, 11.571\n        2017-03-10 01:00:00, 11.6715\n        ... \n        2017-03-13 23:00:00, 9.27675\n\n```\n\n   But note: the original data had 2 decimal places?
