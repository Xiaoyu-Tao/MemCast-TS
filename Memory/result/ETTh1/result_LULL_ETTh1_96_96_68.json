        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points from 2017-03-30 00:00:00 to 2017-04-02 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-04-03 00:00:00 to 2017-04-06 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle) and also a weekly pattern (since we have 4 days: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).\n 2. However, the data for 2017-03-31 (Friday) is constant (1.279) for all 24 hours, which is unusual and might be an anomaly or missing data? But we are told the data has missing values, so we have to work with what we have.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly, we will generate 96 timestamps starting from the next hour after the last given point.\n\n Approach:\n Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the presence of a constant day, we must be cautious.\n\n We can try to model the time series with:\n   - Daily seasonality (period=24)\n   - Weekly seasonality (period=24*7=168) but we only have 4 days, so weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n However, note that the data provided is only 4 days. We have:\n   Day 1: 2017-03-30 (Thursday) - varying\n   Day 2: 2017-03-31 (Friday) - constant (1.279) -> this might be an anomaly or perhaps the transformer was under maintenance?\n   Day 3: 2017-04-01 (Saturday) - varying\n   Day 4: 2017-04-02 (Sunday) - varying\n\n Since we are forecasting the next 4 days (96 hours) from 2017-04-03 (Monday) to 2017-04-06 (Thursday), we might expect:\n   - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n But note: the pattern of Thursday (2017-03-30) and the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are available.\n\n However, the constant Friday is problematic. We have two options:\n   a) Treat the constant Friday as an anomaly and use the other days to forecast.\n   b) Use the entire data and let the model handle it.\n\n Given the constraints, we might use a simple method such as:\n   - Using the average of the same hour of the previous days (excluding the constant day) for the forecast.\n\n But note: we are forecasting for Monday to Thursday. We have:\n   - For Monday: we can use the previous Thursday (2017-03-30) and also the weekend days might not be similar? \n   - However, we don't have a Monday in the history.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality and ignores the weekly component due to lack of data.\n\n Since we are only required to forecast 96 points and the data is small, we can use a simple average by hour of the non-constant days.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   - We have 3 non-constant days: 2017-03-30 (Thu), 2017-04-01 (Sat), 2017-04-02 (Sun). We exclude 2017-03-31 (Fri) because it is constant and likely an anomaly.\n\n   For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the available non-constant days.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) we assign:\n        Day 1 (Monday, 2017-04-03): use the average of the same hour from the available non-constant days? \n        But note: Monday might be different from Thursday and weekend.\n\n   However, without more data, we have to rely on the available days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the constant day.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not been told which values are missing. The constant day might be missing? \n   However, we are not asked to impute the past, only to forecast the future.\n\n   Since we don't have a Monday in the history, we can use the average of the available days for each hour.\n\n   We'll create a list of 24 values (for each hour) by taking the average of the same hour from the three non-constant days.\n\n   Then, we repeat this pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n   Why 4 days? Because 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n   But note: the pattern of a Monday might be different from a Saturday or Sunday? We don't have a Monday, so we use the same pattern for all days.\n\n   This is a simple and robust method given the data.\n\n   Steps:\n     1. Extract the data for the three non-constant days: 2017-03-30, 2017-04-01, 2017-04-02.\n     2. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the mean of the values at that hour from the three days.\n\n   However, note that 2017-03-30 is a Thursday, 2017-04-01 is a Saturday, 2017-04-02 is a Sunday. \n   We are forecasting a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. \n\n   Without more data, we cannot capture the weekly seasonality. Therefore, we will use the same daily pattern for all days.\n\n   We'll create a list `hourly_avg` of 24 values.\n\n   Then, for the next 96 hours, we assign:\n        hour 0: hourly_avg[0]\n        hour 1: hourly_avg[1]\n        ...\n        hour 23: hourly_avg[23]\n        then repeat for the next day.\n\n   But note: the last day in the given data is 2017-04-02 (Sunday). The next day is 2017-04-03 (Monday).\n\n   We generate 96 timestamps starting from 2017-04-03 00:00:00, then 2017-04-03 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-06 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Create a DataFrame from the given data (if we are to code, but we are to reason and then output).\n\n   Step 2: Identify the non-constant days. We can do this by excluding 2017-03-31.\n\n   Step 3: For each hour (0-23), we take the values at that hour from the non-constant days and average.\n\n   However, note: the data for 2017-03-30 starts at 00:00:00 and ends at 23:00:00, same for the others.\n\n   We have:\n        Day1: 2017-03-30: 24 hours (index 0 to 23 in the given data)\n        Day2: 2017-03-31: constant -> skip\n        Day3: 2017-04-01: 24 hours (index 48 to 71 in the given data? because 2 days * 24 = 48, then 24 hours for the next day)\n        Day4: 2017-04-02: 24 hours (index 72 to 95)\n\n   Actually, the given data is 96 points: 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n   So:\n        Day1: rows 0-23 -> 2017-03-30\n        Day2: rows 24-47 -> 2017-03-31\n        Day3: rows 48-71 -> 2017-04-01\n        Day4: rows 72-95 -> 2017-04-02\n\n   We skip Day2 (rows 24-47) because they are constant.\n\n   For hour 0: \n        values = [ row0 (0.701), row48 (0.853), row72 (0.670) ]\n        average = (0.701 + 0.853 + 0.670) / 3 = 2.224 / 3 = 0.741333\n\n   Similarly for hour 1:\n        values = [ row1 (0.640), row49 (0.853), row73 (0.609) ] -> (0.640+0.853+0.609)/3 = 2.102/3 = 0.700667\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n   Then we create the next 96 hours by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n   Step 4: Generate the timestamps.\n\n   The last timestamp in the data is 2017-04-02 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2017-04-03 00:00:00.\n\n   We can use pandas to generate the next 96 hours, but we are to output in the same format.\n\n   However, we are to output without using code? We have to compute 24 averages and then repeat 4 times.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   Hour 0 (00:00): (0.701 + 0.853 + 0.670) / 3 = 0.7413\n   Hour 1 (01:00): (0.640 + 0.853 + 0.609) / 3 = 0.7007\n   Hour 2 (02:00): (0.731 + 0.853 + 0.640) / 3 = 0.7413\n   Hour 3 (03:00): (0.731 + 0.822 + 0.701) / 3 = 0.7513\n   Hour 4 (04:00): (0.701 + 0.761 + 0.761) / 3 = 0.7410\n   Hour 5 (05:00): (1.036 + 0.731 + 0.822) / 3 = 0.8630\n   Hour 6 (06:00): (1.066 + 0.701 + 0.883) / 3 = 0.8833\n   Hour 7 (07:00): (0.914 + 0.822 + 0.883) / 3 = 0.8730\n   Hour 8 (08:00): (1.005 + 1.066 + 1.249) / 3 = 1.1067\n   Hour 9 (09:00): (1.066 + 1.310 + 1.097) / 3 = 1.1577\n   Hour 10 (10:00): (0.883 + 1.279 + 1.066) / 3 = 1.0760\n   Hour 11 (11:00): (1.036 + 1.127 + 0.975) / 3 = 1.0460\n   Hour 12 (12:00): (0.914 + 0.883 + 0.914) / 3 = 0.9037\n   Hour 13 (13:00): (0.975 + 1.127 + 0.944) / 3 = 1.0153\n   Hour 14 (14:00): (1.036 + 1.340 + 1.036) / 3 = 1.1373\n   Hour 15 (15:00): (0.853 + 1.279 + 0.853) / 3 = 0.9950\n   Hour 16 (16:00): (0.883 + 1.371 + 0.853) / 3 = 1.0357\n   Hour 17 (17:00): (1.066 + 1.218 + 0.914) / 3 = 1.0660\n   Hour 18 (18:00): (0.822 + 1.036 + 1.097) / 3 = 0.9850\n   Hour 19 (19:00): (0.853 + 0.883 + 1.066) / 3 = 0.9340\n   Hour 20 (20:00): (0.761 + 0.853 + 0.914) / 3 = 0.8427\n   Hour 21 (21:00): (0.822 + 0.944 + 0.914) / 3 = 0.8933\n   Hour 22 (22:00): (0.822 + 0.944 + 0.975) / 3 = 0.9137\n   Hour 23 (23:00): (0.883 + 0.731 + 0.883) / 3 = 0.8323\n\n   Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n\n        Day1: 2017-04-03: [0.7413, 0.7007, 0.7413, 0.7513, 0.7410, 0.8630, 0.8833, 0.8730, 1.1067, 1.1577, 1.0760, 1.0460, 0.9037, 1.0153, 1.1373, 0.9950, 1.0357, 1.0660, 0.9850, 0.9340, 0.8427, 0.8933, 0.9137, 0.8323]\n        Day2: 2017-04-04: same 24 values repeated\n        Day3: 2017-04-05: same\n        Day4: 2017-04-06: same\n\n   We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places.
