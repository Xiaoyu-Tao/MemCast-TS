        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly and shows a pattern that might be daily (24-hour) and weekly? But we only have 4 days, so we can capture daily seasonality.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model that handles multiple seasonality. Given the data is hourly and we have 4 days, we can consider a daily seasonality of 24.\n\n 4. However, note that the data is non-stationary and has fluctuations. We might use models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality), or even a simple naive approach? But we need 96 points.\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a model that can capture the daily pattern. Let's try to decompose the series to see if there is a clear daily pattern.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But we have only 4 days, so we can average each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? However, that would be a fixed pattern and might not capture the trend.\n\n 7. But note: the data from day to day does not look exactly the same. There is variation. We see that the values on 2017-09-12 are higher in the middle of the day.\n\n 8. We can use an ARIMA model with seasonal components. Since we have 96 points, we can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n 9. However, with only 4 days, fitting a complex model might be challenging. We can try a simple seasonal naive model: using the last available day (2017-09-13) as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be repeating the same day 4 times? The problem is we are forecasting 4 days, so we can repeat the last day? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the average of the four days for each hour? Let's compute the average_hour = [ average of hour 0, hour 1, ... hour 23 for the 4 days ]\n\n Then the next 96 hours (4 days) would be that average repeated 4 times? But that would be the same pattern for each day.\n\n 11. We can also consider a moving average or exponential smoothing. But we are limited by the data.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour across the 4 days to form a daily profile, and then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall trend:\n\n Day 1: 2017-09-10: starts at 0.402, ends at 0.268\n Day 2: 2017-09-11: starts at 1.875, ends at 0.670\n Day 3: 2017-09-12: starts at 1.005, ends at 0.670\n Day 4: 2017-09-13: starts at 0.670, ends at 1.072\n\n There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n 13. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n We have 4 days, so for hour 0: (0.402, 1.875, 1.005, 0.670) -> average = (0.402+1.875+1.005+0.670)/4 = 0.988\n Similarly for hour 1: (1.340, 1.072, 0.469, 0.134) -> (1.340+1.072+0.469+0.134)/4 = 0.75375\n\n But note: the last day (2017-09-13) ends at 23:00 with 1.072, and the next day would start at 00:00. We are going to forecast 4 days starting from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00.\n\n 14. However, the average might smooth out the pattern. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-13) as the base and adjust by the average deviation per hour? But that might be complex.\n\n 15. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have limited data, I will use the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a daily pattern, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for calculation:\n   - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour across the 4 days.\n   - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will use the computed mean for each hour, repeated for each day.\n\n 16. But note: the data might have anomalies? We are told there are missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n 17. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values.\n\n 18. However, we must be cautious: the data on 2017-09-12 has a spike at 11:00 (4.153) and 12:00 (3.148) which might be an anomaly? But we are taking the average, so it will be smoothed.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But the problem does not specify outliers. We'll use the mean.\n\n 20. We'll compute:\n\n   hour0: [0.402, 1.875, 1.005, 0.670] -> mean = (0.402+1.875+1.005+0.670)/4 = 3.952/4 = 0.988\n   hour1: [1.340, 1.072, 0.469, 0.134] -> (1.340+1.072+0.469+0.134)=3.015 -> 3.015/4=0.75375\n   ... and so on.\n\n 21. Then the forecast for:\n      2017-09-14 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0.988\n      2017-09-14 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.75375\n      ... \n      and then for 2017-09-15, 2017-09-16, 2017-09-17 we repeat the same 24-hour pattern.\n\n 22. But note: the last timestamp in the data is 2017-09-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-14 00:00:00\n      End:   2017-09-17 23:00:00\n\n 23. We must generate 96 timestamps and the corresponding HULL values.\n\n 24. However, the average might not be the best because the last day (2017-09-13) ended at 1.072 at 23:00, and the average for hour23 is computed from the 4 days. The hour23 values are: [0.268, 0.670, 0.670, 1.072] -> (0.268+0.670+0.670+1.072)/4 = 2.68/4=0.67\n\n 25. We'll compute all 24 hourly averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n 26. Let's calculate the hourly averages:\n\n   hour0: (0.402 + 1.875 + 1.005 + 0.670) / 4 = 0.988\n   hour1: (1.340 + 1.072 + 0.469 + 0.134) / 4 = 0.75375\n   hour2: (0.603 + 1.139 + 0.603 + 0.670) / 4 = (0.603+1.139+0.603+0.670)=3.015/4=0.75375? Wait, let me recalc: 0.603+1.139=1.742, +0.603=2.345, +0.670=3.015 -> 3.015/4=0.75375\n   But wait, the hour2 for 2017-09-13 is 0.670? Actually, the data for 2017-09-13 02:00:00 is 0.670? Let me check the data:\n\n       2017-09-10 02:00:00  0.603\n       2017-09-11 02:00:00  1.139\n       2017-09-12 02:00:00  0.603\n       2017-09-13 02:00:00  0.670\n\n   So hour2: 0.603, 1.139, 0.603, 0.670 -> sum=3.015, mean=0.75375\n\n   hour3: (0.402, 1.139, 0.737, 0.000) -> 0.402+1.139+0.737+0.000 = 2.278/4=0.5695\n\n   hour4: (0.402, 1.206, 0.134, 0.670) -> 0.402+1.206+0.134+0.670=2.412/4=0.603\n\n   hour5: (-0.402, 1.206, -0.402, 0.402) -> (-0.402+1.206-0.402+0.402)=0.804/4=0.201\n\n   hour6: (-0.067, 1.407, -2.210, 0.268) -> (-0.067+1.407-2.210+0.268)= -0.602/4 = -0.1505\n\n   hour7: (-0.469, 0.268, -1.273, 0.469) -> (-0.469+0.268-1.273+0.469)= -1.005/4 = -0.25125\n\n   hour8: (-0.335, 0.000, 0.000, 1.273) -> (-0.335+0.000+0.000+1.273)=0.938/4=0.2345\n\n   hour9: (0.000, 0.335, 1.005, 2.344) -> (0.000+0.335+1.005+2.344)=3.684/4=0.921\n\n   hour10: (0.000, -0.402, 1.608, 3.282) -> (0.000-0.402+1.608+3.282)=4.488/4=1.122\n\n   hour11: (0.335, -0.268, 4.153, 1.340) -> (0.335-0.268+4.153+1.340)=5.56/4=1.39\n\n   hour12: (2.545, -1.407, 3.148, 1.273) -> (2.545-1.407+3.148+1.273)=5.559/4=1.38975\n\n   hour13: (0.067, -0.938, 3.617, 4.220) -> (0.067-0.938+3.617+4.220)=6.966/4=1.7415\n\n   hour14: (0.469, -0.469, 2.612, 3.416) -> (0.469-0.469+2.612+3.416)=6.028/4=1.507\n\n   hour15: (-0.402, -1.139, 0.871, 1.674) -> (-0.402-1.139+0.871+1.674)=1.004/4=0.251\n\n   hour16: (-0.670, -1.139, -1.072, -0.201) -> (-0.670-1.139-1.072-0.201)= -3.082/4 = -0.7705\n\n   hour17: (-1.072, -1.340, -1.273, -1.273) -> (-1.072-1.340-1.273-1.273)= -4.958/4 = -1.2395\n\n   hour18: (-1.474, -2.076, -0.737, -1.340) -> (-1.474-2.076-0.737-1.340)= -5.627/4 = -1.40675\n\n   hour19: (-1.139, -1.674, -1.674, -1.474) -> (-1.139-1.674-1.674-1.474)= -5.961/4 = -1.49025\n\n   hour20: (-1.273, -1.407, -0.402, -1.273) -> (-1.273-1.407-0.402-1.273)= -4.355/4 = -1.08875\n\n   hour21: (-1.206, -1.808, -0.469, -2.076) -> (-1.206-1.808-0.469-2.076)= -5.559/4 = -1.38975\n\n   hour22: (-1.273, -0.804, 0.067, 0.000) -> (-1.273-0.804+0.067+0.000)= -2.01/4 = -0.5025\n\n   hour23: (0.268, 0.670, 0.670, 1.072) -> (0.268+0.670+0.670+1.072)=2.68/4=0.67\n\n 27. Now, we have 24 values for the average day. We'll repeat this pattern for 4 days to get 96 values.\n\n 28. The forecast:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-09-14):\n        00:00:00 -> 0.988\n        01:00:00 -> 0.75375\n        02:00:00 -> 0.75375   [Note: we computed hour2 as 0.75375? Actually, we computed hour2 as 0.75375? But wait, above for hour2 we have 0.75375? But let me check: \n            hour0: 0.988\n            hour1: 0.75375\n            hour2: 0.75375? Actually, we computed hour2 as 0.75375? But in the calculation above, we did: (0.603+1.139+0.603+0.670)=3.015/4=0.75375 -> correct.\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 29. We must output the data in the same format, with the timestamp and the next 96 hours.\n\n 30. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-14 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-09-14 01:00:00 ... up to 2017-09-17 23:00:00.\n\n 31. We'll create a list of 96 values by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 32. However, note: the average we computed is for the 4 days we have. We are assuming that the next 4 days will follow the same average pattern.\n\n 33. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-09-14 00:00:00  [value1]\n        2017-09-14 01:00:00  [value2]\n        ...\n        2017-09-17 23:00:00  [value96]\n        </answer>\n\n 34. We must be cautious: the data we are given ends at 2017-09-13 23:00:00, so the next timestamp is 2017-09-14 00:00:00.\n\n 35. Let's write the 24 average values we computed:\n\n        hour0: 0.988\n        hour1: 0.75375\n        hour2: 0.75375\n        hour3: 0.5695\n        hour4: 0.603\n        hour5: 0.201\n        hour6: -0.1505\n        hour7: -0.25125\n        hour8: 0.2345\n        hour9: 0.921\n        hour10: 1.122\n        hour11: 1.39\n        hour12: 1.38975\n        hour13: 1.7415\n        hour14: 1.507\n        hour15: 0.251\n        hour16: -0.7705\n        hour17: -1.2395\n        hour18: -1.40675\n        hour19: -1.49025\n        hour20: -1.08875\n        hour21: -1.38975\n        hour22: -0.5025\n        hour23: 0.67\n\n 36. Now, we'll repeat this list 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n 37. We must output the data with the same precision? The input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 38. However, note: the input had values like 0.402, 1.340, etc. So we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: 0.988 -> 0.988\n        hour1: 0.75375 -> 0.754\n        hour2: 0.75375 -> 0.754\n        hour3: 0.5695 -> 0.570\n        hour4: 0.603 -> 0.603\n        hour5: 0.201 -> 0.201\n        hour6: -0.1505 -> -0.151\n        hour7: -0.25125 -> -0.251\n        hour8: 0.2345 -> 0.235\n        hour9: 0.921 -> 0.921\n        hour10: 1.122 -> 1.122\n        hour11: 1.39 -> 1.390   (to 3 decimals: 1.390)\n        hour12: 1.38975 -> 1.390\n        hour13: 1.7415 -> 1.742\n        hour14: 1.507 -> 1.507\n        hour15: 0.251 -> 0.251\n        hour16: -0.7705 -> -0.771\n        hour17: -1.2395 -> -1.240\n        hour18: -1.40675 -> -1.407\n        hour19: -1.49025 -> -1.490\n        hour20: -1.08875 -> -1.089\n        hour21: -1.38975 -> -1.390\n        hour22: -0.5025 -> -0.503\n        hour23: 0.67 -> 0.670\n\n 40. Now, the 4-day forecast:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-14\n          00:00:00  0.988\n          01:00:00  0.754\n          02:00:00  0.754\n          03:00:00  0.570\n          04:00:00  0.603\n          05:00:00  0.201\n          06:00:00 -0.151\n          07:00:00 -0.251\n          08:00:00  0.235\n          09:00:00  0.921\n          10:00:00  1.122\n          11:00:00  1.390\n          12:00:00  1.390\n          13:00:00  1.742\n          14:00:00  1.507\n          15:00:00  0.251\n          16:00:00 -0.771\n          17:00:00 -1.240\n          18:00:00 -1.407\n          19:00:00 -1.490\n          20:00:00 -1.089\n          21:00:00 -1.390\n          22:00:00 -0.503\n          23:00:00  0.670\n\n        Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 41. We'll generate the timestamps and the values.\n\n 42. Code to generate the timestamps:\n\n        start_date = \"2017-09-14 00:00:00\"\n        We need 96 hours.\n\n 43. We'll write the data in the next 4 days: 2017-09-14, 15, 16, 17.\n\n 44. We must output the complete data without any omission.\n\n 45. Let's write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n 46.
