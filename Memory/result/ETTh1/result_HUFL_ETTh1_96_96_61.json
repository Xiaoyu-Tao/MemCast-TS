        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-03-02 00:00:00 to 2017-03-05 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. We assume that the next 96 points might have missing values? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" meaning the provided data? \n    Actually, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" - meaning the provided data might have missing values? \n    However, looking at the provided data, we have 96 consecutive hours without any gap. So we can proceed.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates (with the same hourly frequency).\n\n 3. Since we are an expert in time series forecasting, we can choose an appropriate model. Given the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast 96 points (next 4 days), we can use a model that captures:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours cycle)\n    - Possibly weekly seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly. Therefore, we rely on daily pattern.\n\n 4. We note that the data shows a clear daily pattern: \n    - The values are higher during the night and early morning (e.g., 00:00 to 08:00) and then drop during the day (09:00 to 17:00) and then rise again in the evening.\n\n 5. We can use a simple seasonal model. Since we have only 4 days, we might use a naive seasonal approach (like the last day pattern) but adjusted by the overall trend? \n    However, we note that the pattern is not exactly the same. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components.\n\n 6. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need for 4 days forecast, we can use a model that uses the average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n    Steps for a simple model:\n    - We can compute the average of each hour (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the data shows a trend? Let's check:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-03-02): \n        Min: -10.65 at 12:00, Max: 14.066 at 07:00\n    Day 2 (2017-03-03): \n        Min: -9.511 at 12:00, Max: 16.275 at 01:00\n    Day 3 (2017-03-04): \n        Min: -1.741 at 12:00, Max: 14.334 at 07:00\n    Day 4 (2017-03-05): \n        Min: -3.885 at 12:00, Max: 16.343 at 03:00\n\n    The pattern is similar: \n        - The peak negative is around 12:00 (noon) and the peak positive is in the early morning (around 01:00-07:00) and also in the evening (around 22:00-23:00).\n\n 7. However, we note that the values are not exactly the same each day. We can try to compute the average for each hour:\n\n    For example, for hour 00:00: \n        Day1: 10.516, Day2: 14.736, Day3: 10.583, Day4: 13.396 -> average = (10.516+14.736+10.583+13.396)/4 = 12.30775\n\n    Similarly, for hour 01:00: \n        Day1: 11.32, Day2: 16.276, Day3: 12.257, Day4: 14.803 -> average = (11.32+16.276+12.257+14.803)/4 = 13.664\n\n    But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We don't have missing values in the provided 96 points, so we can use this.\n\n 8. However, this simple average does not account for any trend. We can also consider the possibility of a linear trend? But 4 days is too short to see a trend. \n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-05) as the base and adjust it by the average daily change? But we don't have enough days to compute a reliable trend.\n\n 10. Given the above, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the next 4 days. That is, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same set of 24 hourly averages repeated 4 days.\n\n    But note: the problem says \"the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we have to generate 96 points.\n\n 11. Steps:\n      - Compute the average for each of the 24 hours (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00), we assign:\n            Day1 (2017-03-06): the 24 hourly averages (from 00:00 to 23:00)\n            Day2 (2017-03-07): the same 24 hourly averages\n            Day3 (2017-03-08): the same 24 hourly averages\n            Day4 (2017-03-09): the same 24 hourly averages\n\n 12. However, we note that the data might have a slight drift? But without more data, we cannot capture that. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 13. Let's compute the 24 hourly averages:\n\n      hour00: [10.516, 14.736, 10.583, 13.396] -> (10.516+14.736+10.583+13.396)/4 = 12.30775\n      hour01: [11.320, 16.276, 12.257, 14.803] -> (11.320+16.276+12.257+14.803)/4 = 13.664\n      hour02: [11.454, 15.271, 11.387, 15.271] -> (11.454+15.271+11.387+15.271)/4 = 13.34575\n      hour03: [11.454, 13.463, 11.186, 16.343] -> (11.454+13.463+11.186+16.343)/4 = 13.1115\n      hour04: [10.315, 15.204, 9.779, 12.000] -> Wait, note: on 2017-03-05 04:00 we don't have a value? \n          Actually, the last day (2017-03-05) we have:\n              04:00: 12.726? But wait, the last day provided is 2017-03-05 and we have:\n                  2017-03-05 04:00:00  12.726000 -> so we have 4 values: 10.315, 15.204, 9.779, 12.726 -> average = (10.315+15.204+9.779+12.726)/4 = 12.006\n\n      We must be cautious: the provided data for 2017-03-05 ends at 23:00, so we have 4 days of 24 hours? Actually, we have 96 points (4*24=96). So we have 4 complete days.\n\n      Let me list the hours for each day:\n\n        Day1: 2017-03-02: 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day2: 2017-03-03: 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day3: 2017-03-04: 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day4: 2017-03-05: 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 hours\n\n      So we have 4 days of 24 hours.\n\n 14. We compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n 15. Then we create the next 4 days (2017-03-06 to 2017-03-09) by repeating the same 24 averages for each day.\n\n 16. We round to 3 decimal places as in the original data.\n\n 17. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are generating the forecast without missing values? \n     The problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we should not have missing values in the forecast? \n     We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 18. Let's compute the averages:\n\n      hour00: [10.516, 14.736, 10.583, 13.396] -> 12.30775 -> 12.308\n      hour01: [11.320, 16.276, 12.257, 14.803] -> 13.664 -> 13.664\n      hour02: [11.454, 15.271, 11.387, 15.271] -> 13.34575 -> 13.346\n      hour03: [11.454, 13.463, 11.186, 16.343] -> 13.1115 -> 13.112\n      hour04: [10.315, 15.204, 9.779, 12.726] -> (10.315+15.204+9.779+12.726)=47.024 -> 47.024/4=11.756\n      hour05: [10.516, 14.468, 11.788, 16.209] -> (10.516+14.468+11.788+16.209)=52.981 -> 52.981/4=13.24525 -> 13.245\n      hour06: [11.855, 15.539, 11.387, 14.803] -> (11.855+15.539+11.387+14.803)=53.584 -> 53.584/4=13.396\n      hour07: [14.066, 15.204, 14.334, 16.008] -> (14.066+15.204+14.334+16.008)=59.612 -> 59.612/4=14.903\n      hour08: [5.023, 8.975, 7.636, 12.190] -> (5.023+8.975+7.636+12.190)=33.824 -> 33.824/4=8.456\n      hour09: [-0.067, 0.134, 0.536, 2.746] -> (-0.067+0.134+0.536+2.746)=3.349 -> 3.349/4=0.83725 -> 0.837\n      hour10: [-5.693, -2.143, 2.076, 7.100] -> (-5.693-2.143+2.076+7.100)=1.34 -> 1.34/4=0.335\n      hour11: [-6.430, -5.559, 3.416, 2.679] -> (-6.430-5.559+3.416+2.679)=-5.894 -> -5.894/4=-1.4735 -> -1.474\n      hour12: [-10.650, -9.511, -1.741, -3.885] -> (-10.650-9.511-1.741-3.885)=-25.787 -> -25.787/4=-6.44675 -> -6.447\n      hour13: [-9.243, -1.340, 2.545, 0.536] -> (-9.243-1.340+2.545+0.536)=-7.502 -> -7.502/4=-1.8755 -> -1.876\n      hour14: [-6.832, -3.818, 5.023, 2.143] -> (-6.832-3.818+5.023+2.143)=-3.484 -> -3.484/4=-0.871\n      hour15: [-4.019, -3.349, 5.693, 4.622] -> (-4.019-3.349+5.693+4.622)=2.947 -> 2.947/4=0.73675 -> 0.737\n      hour16: [-1.608, -0.603, 6.296, 5.693] -> (-1.608-0.603+6.296+5.693)=9.778 -> 9.778/4=2.4445 -> 2.445\n      hour17: [4.689, 7.703, 8.439, 8.306] -> (4.689+7.703+8.439+8.306)=29.137 -> 29.137/4=7.28425 -> 7.284\n      hour18: [6.966, 6.765, 7.904, 7.033] -> (6.966+6.765+7.904+7.033)=28.668 -> 28.668/4=7.167\n      hour19: [7.770, 7.904, 7.904, 7.703] -> (7.770+7.904+7.904+7.703)=31.281 -> 31.281/4=7.82025 -> 7.820\n      hour20: [7.502, 7.368, 6.966, 6.698] -> (7.502+7.368+6.966+6.698)=28.534 -> 28.534/4=7.1335 -> 7.134\n      hour21: [8.372, 8.439, 6.564, 6.430] -> (8.372+8.439+6.564+6.430)=29.805 -> 29.805/4=7.45125 -> 7.451\n      hour22: [10.985, 8.038, 7.502, 8.707] -> (10.985+8.038+7.502+8.707)=35.232 -> 35.232/4=8.808\n      hour23: [13.128, 10.717, 10.516, 8.975] -> (13.128+10.717+10.516+8.975)=43.336 -> 43.336/4=10.834\n\n 19. Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n      Day1: 2017-03-06 00:00:00 to 2017-03-06 23:00:00 -> use the 24 averages in order.\n      Day2: 2017-03-07 00:00:00 to 2017-03-07 23:00:00 -> same 24 averages.\n      Day3: 2017-03-08 00:00:00 to 2017-03-08 23:00:00 -> same 24 averages.\n      Day4: 2017-03-09 00:00:00 to 2017-03-09 23:00:00 -> same 24 averages.\n\n 20. We generate the dates:\n\n      Start: 2017-03-06 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-03-05 23:00:00)\n      Then 2017-03-06 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-09 23:00:00.\n\n 21. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-03-06 00:00:00  12.308\n2017-03-06 01:00:00  13.664\n... (for all 96 points)\n2017-03-09 23:00:00  10.834\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 22. We must be cautious: the original data has 3 decimal places. We rounded the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 23.
