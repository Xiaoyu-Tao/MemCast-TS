        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, the provided sample is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. Given the nature of the data (time series with potential seasonality and without a clear from the small sample), we can consider:\n    - The data shows fluctuations and possible daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). However, we only have 4 days, so it's a short series.\n\n 4. We can use a time series forecasting method that can handle short series and seasonality. One common approach is to use the Seasonal Naive method, where we forecast each hour by the value of the same hour in the last available day (or season). Since we have 4 days, we can use the last day (2017-08-12) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But note: we are to predict 96 hours (4 days) and we have 24 hours in a day.\n\n    However, the data does not show a strong consistent daily pattern. Let's check:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-08-09): \n        Min: -2.416, Max: 0.391\n    Day 2 (2017-08-10): \n        Min: -1.812, Max: 3.411\n    Day 3 (2017-08-11): \n        Min: -1.599, Max: 2.843\n    Day 4 (2017-08-12): \n        Min: -2.381, Max: 0.107\n\n    The pattern is not very stable. Alternatively, we can use a model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA. But with only 96 points, and we need 96 forecasts, we must be cautious.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Use the last 24 hours (2017-08-12) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided segment there are none. However, the future might be different.\n\n    However, the problem does not specify the method. We are to provide the forecast.\n\n 6. Considering the requirement for completeness and the fact that we are to provide 96 points, we can use a simple model that is robust to short series.\n\n    We can use:\n        - A seasonal naive forecast: using the last day (24 hours) and repeating it 4 times.\n\n    But note: the last day (2017-08-12) has 24 hours. We can use:\n        forecast for 2017-08-13 00:00:00 = value of 2017-08-12 00:00:00 (-0.391)\n        forecast for 2017-08-13 01:00:00 = value of 2017-08-12 01:00:00 (-0.320)\n        ... until 2017-08-13 23:00:00 = value of 2017-08-12 23:00:00 (-0.391)\n\n        then for 2017-08-14 00:00:00 = value of 2017-08-12 00:00:00 again, and so on.\n\n    This will give 4 repetitions of the last day.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an average of the last 4 days for each hour? But we only have 4 days. For each hour (0 to 23) we average the 4 days? But note: the last day is 2017-08-12, so:\n\n        hour0: (2017-08-09 00:00:00, 2017-08-10 00:00:00, 2017-08-11 00:00:00, 2017-08-12 00:00:00) \n        = (-0.071, -0.746, 0.462, -0.391) -> average = (-0.071 -0.746 +0.462 -0.391)/4 = (-0.746)/4 = -0.1865\n\n    Then we do this for each hour and then repeat the same pattern for 4 days? But that would be 4 days of the same pattern.\n\n 8. However, the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can use the available data.\n\n 9. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide the data, I choose the seasonal naive method using the last day (2017-08-12) as the pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        - The last day in the data is 2017-08-12 (from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00). We will use these 24 values and repeat them 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n    How to generate the dates?\n        The last timestamp in the data is 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n        The next timestamp is 2017-08-13 00:00:00, then 2017-08-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-16 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n\n 10. The forecasted values for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-08-13): the same as 2017-08-12\n        Day 2 (2017-08-14): the same as 2017-08-12\n        Day 3 (2017-08-15): the same as 2017-08-12\n        Day 4 (2017-08-16): the same as 2017-08-12\n\n 11. But note: the data on 2017-08-12 is:\n\n        2017-08-12 00:00:00 -0.391\n        2017-08-12 01:00:00 -0.320\n        2017-08-12 02:00:00  0.107\n        2017-08-12 03:00:00 -0.036\n        2017-08-12 04:00:00  0.000\n        2017-08-12 05:00:00 -0.817\n        2017-08-12 06:00:00 -0.675\n        2017-08-12 07:00:00 -1.279\n        2017-08-12 08:00:00 -0.711\n        2017-08-12 09:00:00 -0.995\n        2017-08-12 10:00:00 -1.031\n        2017-08-12 11:00:00 -1.670\n        2017-08-12 12:00:00 -1.492\n        2017-08-12 13:00:00 -1.386\n        2017-08-12 14:00:00 -1.386\n        2017-08-12 15:00:00 -1.777\n        2017-08-12 16:00:00 -1.315\n        2017-08-12 17:00:00 -1.635\n        2017-08-12 18:00:00 -1.635\n        2017-08-12 19:00:00 -2.381\n        2017-08-12 20:00:00 -2.168\n        2017-08-12 21:00:00 -1.564\n        2017-08-12 22:00:00 -1.919\n        2017-08-12 23:00:00 -0.391\n\n 12. We will generate the next 96 hours by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 13. Format: We must output the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same format as the input, with the date and the MULL value.\n\n 14. The first forecasted date: 2017-08-13 00:00:00, which uses the value as 2017-08-12 00:00:00 -> -0.391\n\n 15. We write 96 lines.\n\n 16. Note: The method is simple and may not be the most accurate, but without more data and a clear trend, it is a common baseline.\n\n 17. We output the data in the required format.\n\n Let's generate the dates and values:\n\n    Start date: 2017-08-13 00:00:00\n    End date: 2017-08-16 23:00:00\n\n    We have 4 blocks of 24 hours.\n\n    Block 1 (2017-08-13): \n        00:00:00 -> -0.391\n        01:00:00 -> -0.320\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> -0.391\n\n    Block 2 (2017-08-14): same as above\n    Block 3 (2017-08-15): same as above\n    Block 4 (2017-08-16): same as above\n\n 18. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-08-13 00:00:00 -0.391\n        2017-08-13 01:00:00 -0.320\n        ... \n        2017-08-16 23:00:00 -0.391\n        </answer>\n\n 19. But note: the original data has the MULL value as a float with 3 decimal places. We keep the same precision.\n\n 20. We output exactly 96 lines.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    We have the last day (2017-08-12) as a list of 24 values.\n\n    We'll create a list for the next 96 hours:\n\n        base_values = [-0.391, -0.320, 0.107, -0.036, 0.000, -0.817, -0.675, -1.279, -0.711, -0.995, -1.031, -1.670, -1.492, -1.386, -1.386, -1.777, -1.315, -1.635, -1.635, -2.381, -2.168, -1.564, -1.919, -0.391]\n\n    Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n    For the dates, we start from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 and add 1 hour until we have 96 timestamps.\n\n 21. Code to generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 8, 13, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            value = base_values[i % 24]\n\n 22. We output the date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 23. We write the data in the answer block.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast. We are not given any missing values in the provided data, and we are to forecast without gaps.\n\n Let's generate the data accordingly.\n",
