        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-09-02 00:00:00 to 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to produce 96 future points (4 days).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might have missing values. However, for forecasting, we must handle the given series appropriately.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data shows a clear daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints of the problem and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer without omitting any content, we will use a simple but effective method: \n   - We will use the last 4 days (96 hours) to compute an average daily profile (by averaging the values at the same hour of the day for the 4 days we have).\n   - Then, we will use this average daily profile to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the profile 4 times.\n\n However, note that the data does not have a constant daily pattern? Let's check:\n\n But wait: the data provided is exactly 4 days (from 2017-09-02 to 2017-09-05). So we have 4 full days.\n\n How to handle the fact that the pattern might change? We are not accounting for trend. But the period is short (4 days) and we are forecasting 4 days, so we assume the daily pattern is stable.\n\n Steps in detail:\n  1. Extract the hour-of-day for each record (0 to 23).\n  2. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of the HULL values at that hour across the 4 days.\n\n Example: \n   For hour 0: \n        Day1: 1.206, Day2: 1.005, Day3: 1.072, Day4: 0.469 -> average = (1.206+1.005+1.072+0.469)/4 = 3.752/4 = 0.938\n\n  3. Then, for the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-09-06 00:00:00), we assign the average value for hour 0 at 2017-09-06 00:00:00, hour 1 at 2017-09-06 01:00:00, ... until hour 23 at 2017-09-06 23:00:00, and then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a long-term trend, and 4 days is too short. Also, we are only forecasting 4 days ahead. So we rely on the daily seasonality.\n\n However, let's check the daily averages:\n\n  We can also consider using a moving average or exponential smoothing, but the problem is we have only 4 days. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-05) and then use the average daily pattern to adjust? But the problem says to forecast 96 points.\n\n  Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a complete answer, we choose the average daily profile.\n\n  But note: the data has negative values and the pattern is not exactly the same every day. However, without more data, we use the average.\n\n  We must generate the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n  Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n  We have 4 days: \n      Day1: 2017-09-02 (index 0-23)\n      Day2: 2017-09-03 (index 24-47)\n      Day3: 2017-09-04 (index 48-71)\n      Day4: 2017-09-05 (index 72-95)\n\n  We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n  For hour h (0..23):\n      values = [ data[h], data[24+h], data[48+h], data[72+h] ]\n      hourly_avg[h] = mean(values)\n\n  Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00) will be:\n      Day1: 2017-09-06: hourly_avg[0] to hourly_avg[23]\n      Day2: 2017-09-07: hourly_avg[0] to hourly_avg[23]\n      Day3: 2017-09-08: hourly_avg[0] to hourly_avg[23]\n      Day4: 2017-09-09: hourly_avg[0] to hourly_avg[23]\n\n  We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n  Let's compute the next date: the last given date is 2017-09-05 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-09-06 00:00:00.\n\n  We'll create 96 rows.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  Step 1: Parse the given data (we have it as a string, but we can split by lines and then extract the values).\n\n  However, note: the data is provided as a string. We are given 96 rows.\n\n  We can write a small code to compute the averages, but note: we are an AI, so we can do the computation in our mind? Actually, we can simulate.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write a script in our mind and then output the result.\n\n  Since the problem requires the complete data, we must output 96 rows of forecast.\n\n  We'll compute the hourly averages:\n\n  Let me list the values for each hour:\n\n  Hour 0: [1.206, 1.005, 1.072, 0.469] -> sum=3.752, avg=0.938\n  Hour 1: [1.139, -0.067, 0.603, 0.134] -> sum=1.809, avg=0.45225\n  Hour 2: [0.871, 0.000, 0.871, 0.067] -> sum=1.809, avg=0.45225\n  Hour 3: [-0.134, 0.402, 0.469, 0.000] -> sum=0.737, avg=0.18425\n  Hour 4: [0.603, 0.938, 0.804, -0.268] -> sum=2.077, avg=0.51925\n  Hour 5: [0.402, -0.067, -0.067, 0.402] -> sum=0.67, avg=0.1675\n  Hour 6: [0.201, -0.938, -0.067, -0.402] -> sum=-1.206, avg=-0.3015\n  Hour 7: [0.067, 0.201, 0.536, 0.670] -> sum=1.474, avg=0.3685\n  Hour 8: [0.067, -0.201, 0.603, 0.201] -> sum=0.67, avg=0.1675\n  Hour 9: [-0.469, -0.335, 0.000, 0.201] -> sum=-0.603, avg=-0.15075\n  Hour10: [-0.469, -0.268, 0.134, 0.067] -> sum=-0.536, avg=-0.134\n  Hour11: [-1.206, -0.335, -0.067, 0.067] -> sum=-1.541, avg=-0.38525\n  Hour12: [-1.206, -1.139, -1.474, -0.134] -> sum=-3.953, avg=-0.98825\n  Hour13: [-0.871, -0.737, -0.067, 1.340] -> sum=-0.335, avg=-0.08375\n  Hour14: [-0.469, -0.469, 0.268, 0.402] -> sum=-0.268, avg=-0.067\n  Hour15: [-0.402, -0.603, -0.067, -0.670] -> sum=-1.742, avg=-0.4355\n  Hour16: [-1.407, -1.608, -1.206, -0.603] -> sum=-4.824, avg=-1.206\n  Hour17: [-1.674, -1.808, -1.674, -1.139] -> sum=-6.295, avg=-1.57375\n  Hour18: [-2.143, -2.344, -2.210, -1.674] -> sum=-8.371, avg=-2.09275\n  Hour19: [-2.143, -2.344, -2.478, -1.474] -> sum=-8.439, avg=-2.10975\n  Hour20: [-1.942, -2.210, -2.210, -1.474] -> sum=-7.836, avg=-1.959\n  Hour21: [-2.009, -2.076, -2.277, -1.206] -> sum=-7.568, avg=-1.892\n  Hour22: [-1.072, -1.206, -1.541, -0.737] -> sum=-4.556, avg=-1.139\n  Hour23: [-0.201, 0.134, -0.268, -0.268] -> sum=-0.603, avg=-0.15075\n\n  Now, we have the 24 hourly averages.\n\n  Then, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n      Start: 2017-09-06 00:00:00 -> hour0: 0 = 0.938\n              2017-09-06 01:00:00 -> hour1: 0.45225\n              ... until 2017-09-06 23:00:00: -0.15075\n\n      Then 2017-09-07 00:00:00: 0.938 again, and so on.\n\n  We must output the dates in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n  Let's generate the dates:\n\n      The last date in the input is 2017-09-05 23:00:00.\n      Then:\n          2017-09-06 00:00:00\n          2017-09-06 01:00:00\n          ...\n          2017-09-06 23:00:00\n          2017-09-07 00:00:00\n          ...\n          2017-09-09 23:00:00\n\n  We'll create 96 rows.\n\n  We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  However, note: the input has negative values and 3 decimal places.\n\n  Let's write the forecast:\n\n  We have the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n  Hour0: 0.938\n  Hour1: 0.452 -> 0.452 (but 0.45225 rounded to 3 decimals is 0.452? Actually, 0.45225 -> 0.452? \n          But note: 0.45225 is closer to 0.452?
