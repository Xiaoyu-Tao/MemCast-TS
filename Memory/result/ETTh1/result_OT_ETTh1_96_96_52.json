        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are in a constrained environment without the ability to run complex models, we will use a simple time series forecasting method.\n However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none.\n\n We can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or \n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components (if seasonality exists).\n\n Observing the data: \n   There appears to be daily seasonality (24 hours). The temperature rises during the day and falls at night.\n\n We can use a seasonal model. Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture:\n   - Level, trend (if any) and seasonality.\n\n Given the limited history, we can use a simple seasonal naive approach or a seasonal decomposition with STL and then forecast with ETS or ARIMA.\n\n However, the problem requires 96 points and we must output the complete data.\n\n Given the constraints of this environment, we will use a simple method: \n   - We will use the last 24 hours (one day) and replicate it for the next 4 days? But that might not capture the trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour and then adjust by the last day's deviation? \n\n But note: the data shows a pattern that is not exactly the same every day. We see a general increase in the values from day to day? \n   Day1: 2017-01-25: min ~5.2, max ~12.5\n   Day2: 2017-01-26: min ~8.8, max ~13.8\n   Day3: 2017-01-27: min ~5.1, max ~13.9\n   Day4: 2017-01-28: min ~5.0, max ~13.2\n\n There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. So we can assume a constant seasonal pattern.\n\n We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n   - Group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean of the 4 days for that hour.\n\n However, note that the last day (2017-01-28) ends at 12.170 at 23:00. The next hour would be 00:00 of 2017-01-29.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour 00:00: (6.261 + 8.864 + 13.999 + 5.065) / 4 = (6.261+8.864=15.125; 15.125+13.999=29.124; 29.124+5.065=34.189) -> 8.54725\n   hour 01:00: (6.402+9.356+13.155+5.276)/4 = (6.402+9.356=15.758; 15.758+13.155=28.913; 28.913+5.276=34.189) -> 8.54725\n   ... and so on.\n\n But wait, the values for the same hour across days are not necessarily similar? Let's check:\n\n   Day1: 00:00 -> 6.261\n   Day2: 00:00 -> 8.864\n   Day3: 00:00 -> 13.999\n   Day4: 00:00 -> 5.065\n\n The variation is high. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-28) as the base and then adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n Another idea: use Seasonal Naive: \n   - Forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can use the same hour from the same day of the previous week? But we don't have a week.\n\n Since we only have 4 days, we can use the average of the last 3 days? or the entire 4 days? \n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the model. We are experts and we must choose a reasonable method.\n\n Considering the data, we can try to use a moving average over the same hour of the last 4 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a drop on the last day (2017-01-28) at 00:00 to 5.065, which is lower than the previous days. \n\n We can use the average for each hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, the forecast for the next 4 days at hour h will be:\n        avg_h = (OT_{day1, h} + OT_{day2, h} + OT_{day3, h} + OT_{day4, h}) / 4\n\n Then for the next 4 days (2017-01-29 to 2017-02-01), each day we assign the 24 hours with the computed averages.\n\n However, this method ignores any trend and the last known value. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-28) and add the average daily seasonal adjustment? \n\n But let's do the simple average.\n\n We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n How to compute:\n\n   hour00: [2017-01-25 00:00:00, 2017-01-26 00:00:00, 2017-01-27 00:00:00, 2017-01-28 00:00:00] -> [6.261, 8.864, 13.999, 5.065] -> mean = (6.261+8.864+13.999+5.065)/4 = 8.54725\n   hour01: [6.402, 9.356, 13.155, 5.276] -> (6.402+9.356+13.155+5.276)/4 = 8.54725? Let me calculate: 6.402+9.356=15.758; 15.758+13.155=28.913; 28.913+5.276=34.189 -> 34.189/4=8.54725 -> wait, same as hour00? That's a coincidence.\n\n   Actually, let me check the data: \n        hour00: 6.261, 8.864, 13.999, 5.065 -> sum=34.189 -> 8.54725\n        hour01: 6.402, 9.356, 13.155, 5.276 -> 6.402+9.356=15.758; 15.758+13.155=28.913; 28.913+5.276=34.189 -> 8.54725\n\n   This is because the data provided only has 96 points? Actually, the data for the first two days and the last two days might be such that the sum of the same hour over 4 days is the same? \n\n   Let me check hour02:\n        2017-01-25 02:00:00 -> 5.698\n        2017-01-26 02:00:00 -> 10.271\n        2017-01-27 02:00:00 -> 12.100\n        2017-01-28 02:00:00 -> 5.276\n        Sum = 5.698+10.271+12.100+5.276 = 33.345 -> mean=8.33625\n\n   So it's not the same.\n\n   We must compute each hour individually.\n\n However, note that the data for the same hour across the 4 days might not be available? Actually, we have exactly 4 days and 24 hours per day.\n\n We can create a table for the 24 hours:\n\n   hour00: [6.261, 8.864, 13.999, 5.065] -> mean = (6.261+8.864+13.999+5.065)/4 = 34.189/4 = 8.54725\n   hour01: [6.402, 9.356, 13.155, 5.276] = 34.189/4 = 8.54725? \n        Actually, 6.402+9.356=15.758; 15.758+13.155=28.913; 28.913+5.276=34.189 -> 8.54725\n   hour02: [5.698, 10.271, 12.100, 5.276] -> 5.698+10.271=15.969; 15.969+12.100=28.069; 28.069+5.276=33.345 -> 8.33625\n   hour03: [5.979, 10.200, 9.919, 5.206] -> 5.979+10.200=16.179; 16.179+9.919=26.098; 26.098+5.206=31.304 -> 7.826\n   ... and so on.\n\n But wait, the last day (2017-01-28) hour02 is 5.276? Actually, in the data for 2017-01-28, the hour02 is at 02:00:00: 2017-01-28 02:00:00  5.276 -> but in the list above for hour02 we have 5.276? \n\n However, the data for 2017-01-28 02:00:00 is 5.276? Actually, the data for 2017-01-28 02:00:00 is 5.276? Let me check the provided data:\n\n   2017-01-28 00:00:00  5.065\n   2017-01-28 01:00:00  5.276\n   2017-01-28 02:00:00  5.276   -> yes.\n\n So we compute the average for each hour index (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n   Day1: 2017-01-29: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n   Day2: 2017-01-30: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n   Day3: 2017-01-31: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n   Day4: 2017-02-01: [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n\n But note: the last day in the provided data is 2017-01-28, so the next day is 2017-01-29.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with 4 days, it's hard to say. The average method is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n   We have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour00: [6.261, 8.864, 13.999, 5.065] -> 8.54725\n        hour01: [6.402, 9.356, 13.155, 5.276] -> 8.54725\n        hour02: [5.698, 10.271, 12.100, 5.276] -> 8.33625\n        hour03: [5.979, 10.200, 9.919, 5.206] -> 7.826\n        hour04: [5.909, 10.622, 8.723, 4.924] -> (5.909+10.622+8.723+4.924)/4 = 30.178/4 = 7.5445\n        hour05: [5.768, 9.567, 9.849, 5.417] -> (5.768+9.567+9.849+5.417)/4 = 30.601/4 = 7.65025\n        hour06: [5.206, 9.497, 7.316, 5.557] -> (5.206+9.497+7.316+5.557)/4 = 27.576/4 = 6.894\n        hour07: [6.261, 10.060, 6.472, 5.487] -> (6.261+10.060+6.472+5.487)/4 = 28.28/4 = 7.07\n        hour08: [6.261, 10.271, 5.135, 5.768] -> (6.261+10.271+5.135+5.768)/4 = 27.435/4 = 6.85875\n        hour09: [6.824, 10.411, 6.120, 6.402] -> (6.824+10.411+6.120+6.402)/4 = 29.757/4 = 7.43925\n        hour10: [7.316, 9.567, 6.261, 6.894] -> (7.316+9.567+6.261+6.894)/4 = 30.038/4 = 7.5095\n        hour11: [7.316, 11.115, 6.683, 7.879] -> (7.316+11.115+6.683+7.879)/4 = 32.993/4 = 8.24825\n        hour12: [8.301, 10.552, 7.809, 9.004] -> (8.301+10.552+7.809+9.004)/4 = 35.666/4 = 8.9165\n        hour13: [9.567, 10.482, 7.949, 10.904] -> (9.567+10.482+7.949+10.904)/4 = 38.902/4 = 9.7255\n        hour14: [12.522, 12.662, 8.442, 13.225] -> (12.522+12.662+8.442+13.225)/4 = 46.851/4 = 11.71275\n        hour15: [11.044, 11.537, 8.160, 12.733] -> (11.044+11.537+8.160+12.733)/4 = 43.474/4 = 10.8685\n        hour16: [10.130, 12.029, 8.160, 12.240] -> (10.130+12.029+8.160+12.240)/4 = 42.559/4 = 10.63975\n        hour17: [10.622, 13.366, 8.231, 12.240] -> (10.622+13.366+8.231+12.240)/4 = 44.459/4 = 11.11475\n        hour18: [11.185, 13.788, 8.020, 12.029] -> (11.185+13.788+8.020+12.029)/4 = 45.022/4 = 11.2555\n        hour19: [11.044, 12.733, 8.301, 10.622] -> (11.044+12.733+8.301+10.622)/4 = 42.7/4 = 10.675\n        hour20: [11.467, 12.662, 6.402, 11.467] -> (11.467+12.662+6.402+11.467)/4 = 41.998/4 = 10.4995\n        hour21: [10.622, 13.155, 6.050, 11.185] -> (10.622+13.155+6.050+11.185)/4 = 41.012/4 = 10.253\n        hour22: [10.552, 12.662, 5.979, 11.396] -> (10.552+12.662+5.979+11.396)/4 = 40.589/4 = 10.14725\n        hour23: [8.512, 13.858, 5.557, 12.170] -> (8.512+13.858+5.557+12.170)/4 = 40.097/4 = 10.02425\n\n Then, the forecast for:\n\n   2017-01-29 00:00:00 -> 8.54725\n   2017-01-29 01:00:00 -> 8.54725\n   2017-01-29 02:00:00 -> 8.33625\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points we don't have any. \n   And we are forecasting the next 96 points without any gaps? We are to provide the complete data.\n\n We must output 96 points.\n\n However, note: the last day in the provided data is 2017-01-28 23:00:00 -> 12.170.\n\n The next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-29 00:00:00\n   End: 2017-02-01 23:00:00\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n Format: \n        date (as string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS') and the OT value (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input).\n\n We have the 24 averages. We'll use the same set of averages for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n   Day 5 (2017-01-29): \n        00:00:00 -> 8.547\n        01:00:00 -> 8.547\n        02:00:00 -> 8.336\n        03:00:00 -> 7.826\n        04:00:00 -> 7.545\n        05:00:00 -> 7.650\n        06:00:00 -> 6.894\n        07:00:00 -> 7.070\n        08:00:00 -> 6.859\n        09:00:00 -> 7.439\n        10:00:00 -> 7.510\n        11:00:00 -> 8.248\n        12:00:00 -> 8.917\n        13:00:00 -> 9.726\n        14:00:00 -> 11.713\n        15:00:00 -> 10.869\n        16:00:00 -> 10.640\n        17:00:00 -> 11.115\n        18:00:00 -> 11.256\n        19:00:00 -> 10.675\n        20:00:00 -> 10.500\n        21:00:00 -> 10.253\n        22:00:00 -> 10.147\n        23:00:00 -> 10.024\n\n   Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n But note: the averages we computed are for the same hour of the day. So we use the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n However, we must round to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let me recalc and round:\n\n   hour00: 8.54725 -> 8.547\n   hour01: 8.54725 -> 8.547\n   hour02: 8.33625 -> 8.336\n   hour03: 7.826 -> 7.826\n   hour04: 7.5445 -> 7.545 (rounding: 7.5445 -> 7.545 because 5 rounds up)\n   hour05: 7.65025 -> 7.650\n   hour06: 6.894 -> 6.894\n   hour07: 7.07 -> 7.070 (to 3 decimals)\n   hour08: 6.85875 -> 6.859\n   hour09: 7.43925 -> 7.439\n   hour10: 7.5095 -> 7.510\n   because 7.5095: the fourth decimal is 5 -> round up the third decimal from 9 to 10 -> so 7.510)\n   hour11: 8.24825 -> 8.248\n   hour12: 8.9165 -> 8.917 (because 8.9165 -> 8.917)\n   hour13: 9.7255 -> 9.726\n   hour14: 11.71275 -> 11.713\n   hour15: 10.8685 -> 10.869\n   because 10.8685: rounding the 4th decimal 5 -> round up the 8 to 9 -> 10.869)\n   Actually, 10.8685: \n        The third decimal is 8, the fourth is 5 -> we round up the 8 to 9? \n        But 10.8685: \n            The number is 10.8685, so we look at the fourth decimal: 5 -> then we round up the third decimal (8) to 9 -> 10.869.\n\n   hour16: 10.63975 -> 10.640\n   hour17: 11.11475 -> 11.115\n   hour18: 11.2555 -> 11.256\n   hour19: 10.675 -> 10.675\n   hour20: 10.4995 -> 10.500\n   hour21: 10.253 -> 10.253\n   hour22: 10.14725 -> 10.147\n   hour23: 10.02425 -> 10.024\n\n But note: for hour10: 7.5095 -> rounding: \n        The third decimal is 9, and the next is 5 -> rounding 9 up by 1 would make it 10, so we carry over: 7.510.\n\n Similarly, hour12: 8.9165 -> \n        The third decimal is 6, the fourth is 5 -> round up the 6 to 7 -> 8.917.\n\n Let me recompute a few to be safe:\n\n   hour04: 7.5445 -> \n        The third decimal is 4, the fourth is 5 -> round up the 4 to 5 -> 7.545.\n\n   hour15: 10.8685 -> \n        The third decimal is 8, the fourth is 5 -> round up the 8 to 9 -> 10.869.\n\n   hour16: 10.63975 -> \n        The third decimal is 9, the fourth is 7 -> so we round up the 9: 10.640 (because 9+1=10, so 10.64 becomes 10.640, but note: 10.63975 -> \n        Actually, we have 10.63975: \n            We want 3 decimals: look at the fourth decimal (7) which is >=5 -> round up the third decimal (9) -> becomes 10.640.\n\n   hour17: 11.11475 -> \n        third decimal: 4, fourth: 7 -> round up the 4 to 5 -> 11.115.\n\n   hour18: 11.2555 -> \n        third decimal: 5, fourth: 5 -> round up the 5 to 6 -> 11.256.\n\n   hour20: 10.4995 -> \n        third decimal: 9, fourth: 5 -> round up: 10.500.\n\n So the rounded averages:\n\n   h00: 8.547\n   h01: 8.547\n   h02: 8.336\n   h03: 7.826\n   h04: 7.545\n   h05: 7.650\n   h06: 6.894\n   h07: 7.070\n   h08: 6.859\n   h09: 7.439\n   h10: 7.510\n   h11: 8.248\n   h12: 8.917\n   h13: 9.726\n   h14: 11.713\n   h15: 10.869\n   h16: 10.640\n   h17: 11.115\n   h18: 11.256\n   h19: 10.675\n   h20: 10.500\n   h21: 10.253\n   h22: 10.147\n   h23: 10.024\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-29 00:00:00 -> h00: 8.547\n   Then 2017-01-29 01:00:00 -> h01: 8.547\n   ... until 2017-01-29 23:00:00 -> h23: 10.024\n\n   Then 2017-01-30 00:00:00 -> h00: 8.547\n   ... and so on until 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n\n We'll write the dates accordingly.\n\n Note: The dates are in the format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:00:00'\n\n We must generate:\n\n   from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n\n How many days? 4 days: 29, 30, 31, and Feb 1.\n\n But note: January has 31 days, so:\n\n   2017-01-29, 2017-01-30, 2017-01-31, then 2017-02-01.\n\n We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n We must output:\n\n    <answer>\n    \n        date                  OT\n        2017-01-29 00:00:00  8.547\n        2017-01-29 01:00:00  8.547\n        ... \n        2017-02-01 23:00:00  10.024\n\n    </answer>\n\n We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\".\n\n We'll generate the data as described.\n\n But note: this is a very simple method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Prophet, etc.) but given the constraints, we use this.\n\n Let's write the data.\n",
