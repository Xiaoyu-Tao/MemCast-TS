        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? Actually, the provided data for the past 96 dates seems complete (no explicit missing values in the given snippet). \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. Since we are only given 96 points and they appear complete, we assume that the provided history is without missing values for the purpose of forecasting.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we will generate timestamps for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-07-12 00:00:00.\n\n 3. We choose a forecasting method. Since we are an expert, we can use a time series model. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and the data shows some fluctuations (with a possible daily pattern and some anomalies), \n    we can use a model that can capture seasonality. The data has a frequency of 24 hours (daily seasonality). \n\n 4. We can use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 96 points, we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing. But the data has clear daily patterns (note the drop at night and rise during the day? but looking at the data, it's not very clear because of some abrupt changes.\n\n 6. Let's try to see if there is a pattern: \n    - From 2017-07-08 to 2017-07-11, we see that the temperature fluctuates and there are some extreme values (like 10.2, 11.18, 14.49, etc.) which might be anomalies.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the short history, we might use a model that is robust to some anomalies. We can use the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and then forecast the components.\n\n 8. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided history, we don't have missing values. For forecasting, we assume the history is complete. For the future, we will produce 96-point forecast without gaps.\n\n 9. We decide to use the Exponential Smoothing with additive seasonality (Holt-Winters) because the seasonality does not seem to be multiplicative (the variation is roughly constant). \n    But note: the data has a daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 10. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Create a time series object with frequency=24.\n     - Fit a Holt-Winters model (additive seasonality) to the data.\n     - Forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 11. However, we are not coding but simulating the output. We must generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n 12. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided data might have missing values? \n     Actually, the provided data for the past 96 points does not have missing values. So we proceed.\n\n 13. Since we cannot run actual code, we have to simulate the forecast. We can describe the method and then provide the forecasted values.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n      - Compute the average of each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have, and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n      But note: the data has a trend? and also the last day (2017-07-11) has higher temperatures? \n\n 15. Let's check the average per hour:\n\n      Hour 0: [21.174, 20.400999, 14.914, 19.556] -> average = (21.174+20.401+14.914+19.556)/4 = 76.045/4 = 19.01125\n      ... but this might not capture the trend.\n\n 16. We can also consider a linear trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and without actual computation, we have to make a reasonable forecast.\n\n 18. We note that the last day (2017-07-11) has higher temperatures than the previous days. So we might expect a continuation of the recent pattern.\n\n 19. We are going to generate the next 96 points by:\n\n      a) Extending the time index: \n          Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00, then 2017-07-12 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n      b) We will use the last 24 hours (2017-07-11 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00) as a base and then adjust by a small trend and the overall pattern.\n\n      c) But note: the temperature might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data for that.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour, but with a slight upward trend because the last day was warmer.\n\n 21. We can compute the average for each hour over the 4 days and then add the difference between the last day and the average of the previous 3 days? \n\n 22. However, due to the complexity and without running a model, we decide to use the last day (2017-07-11) as the pattern for the next day, and then for the subsequent days, we adjust by the average change from one day to the next.\n\n 23. But note: the data has a drop on 2017-07-09 and 2017-07-10? So we must be cautious.\n\n 24. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by:\n\n      Day1 (2017-07-12): use the values of 2017-07-11 (the last day) but with a small random fluctuation? \n      But we cannot introduce randomness arbitrarily.\n\n 25. We can use a naive forecast: the next 24 hours will be the same as the last 24 hours? Then the next 24 after that will be the same as the 24 hours before the last? \n\n      That would be:\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00 = 2017-07-11 00:00:00 (19.556)\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00 = 2017-07-11 01:00:00 (19.486)\n        ... until 2017-07-12 23:00:00 = 2017-07-11 23:00:00 (20.823)\n\n      Then for 2017-07-13: we use 2017-07-10? \n        2017-07-13 00:00:00 = 2017-07-10 00:00:00 (14.914)\n        ... but that would be a big drop and not consistent.\n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. \n\n      Let's calculate the average for hour 0: \n        Day1: 21.174, Day2: 20.400999, Day3: 14.914, Day4: 19.556 -> average = (21.174+20.401+14.914+19.556)/4 = 76.045/4 = 19.01125\n\n      Similarly for hour 1: \n        Day1: 21.315001, Day2: 20.612, Day3: 17.516001, Day4: 19.486 -> (21.315+20.612+17.516+19.486)/4 = 78.929/4 = 19.73225\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 27. Then we use these 24 averages for the next 4 days? That is, for each day in the forecast period, we use the same 24 averages? \n\n      So for 2017-07-12 00:00:00: 19.01125\n          2017-07-12 01:00:00: 19.73225\n          ... and then for 2017-07-13 00:00:00: again 19.01125, etc.\n\n 28. But this ignores any trend. The last day was warmer than the previous days, so we might want to adjust.\n\n 29. We can compute the overall average of the last day (2017-07-11) and compare it to the overall average of the entire 4 days? \n\n      Entire 4 days average: (all 96 points) -> we can compute: \n        total = sum of all 96 points / 96.\n\n      But without the exact sum, we can approximate: \n        The last day (24 points) has values around 19.5 to 25.25 -> average around 21.5? \n        The entire 4 days: we see some low values (down to 10.2) so the average might be lower.\n\n 30. Given the time, we decide to use the average by hour of the 4 days as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 31. We must calculate the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n      Hour 0: (21.174000 + 20.400999 + 14.914000 + 19.556000) / 4 = (21.174+20.401+14.914+19.556) = 76.045 -> 19.01125\n      Hour 1: (21.315001 + 20.612000 + 17.516001 + 19.486000) / 4 = (21.315+20.612+17.516+19.486) = 78.929 -> 19.73225\n      Hour 2: (21.245001 + 20.893000 + 17.445999 + 19.556000) / 4 = (21.245+20.893+17.446+19.556) = 79.14 -> 19.785\n      Hour 3: (22.089001 + 21.034000 + 11.185000 + 19.697001) / 4 = (22.089+21.034+11.185+19.697) = 74.005 -> 18.50125\n      Hour 4: (21.667000 + 20.681999 + 11.256000 + 18.572001) / 4 = (21.667+20.682+11.256+18.572) = 72.177 -> 18.04425\n      Hour 5: (21.525999 + 16.813000 + 10.200000 + 18.783001) / 4 = (21.526+16.813+10.200+18.783) = 67.322 -> 16.8305\n      Hour 6: (21.385000 + 19.416000 + 14.140000 + 18.923000) / 4 = (21.385+19.416+14.140+18.923) = 73.864 -> 18.466\n      Hour 7: (21.878000 + 17.516001 + 15.687000 + 18.783001) / 4 = (21.878+17.516+15.687+18.783) = 73.864 -> 18.466\n      Hour 8: (21.034000 + 18.853001 + 17.516001 + 18.361000) / 4 = (21.034+18.853+17.516+18.361) = 75.764 -> 18.941\n      Hour 9: (20.612000 + 21.104000 + 17.165001 + 18.219999) / 4 = (20.612+21.104+17.165+18.220) = 77.101 -> 19.27525\n      Hour 10: (20.118999 + 20.400999 + 17.094000 + 18.993999) / 4 = (20.119+20.401+17.094+18.994) = 76.608 -> 19.152\n      Hour 11: (19.768000 + 21.525999 + 17.726999 + 20.118999) / 4 = (19.768+21.526+17.727+20.119) = 79.14 -> 19.785\n      Hour 12: (18.993999 + 21.597000 + 18.219999 + 20.893000) / 4 = (18.994+21.597+18.220+20.893) = 79.704 -> 19.926\n      Hour 13: (19.768000 + 20.893000 + 18.290001 + 20.681999) / 4 = (19.768+20.893+18.290+20.682) = 79.633 -> 19.90825\n      Hour 14: (19.697001 + 18.500999 + 18.642000 + 23.143999) / 4 = (19.697+18.501+18.642+23.144) = 79.984 -> 19.996\n      Hour 15: (19.275000 + 18.572001 + 19.134001 + 24.481001) / 4 = (19.275+18.572+19.134+24.481) = 81.462 -> 20.3655\n      Hour 16: (20.260000 + 19.134001 + 20.752001 + 25.254999) / 4 = (20.260+19.134+20.752+25.255) = 85.401 -> 21.35025\n      Hour 17: (19.768000 + 18.783001 + 19.979000 + 23.988001) / 4 = (19.768+18.783+19.979+23.988) = 82.518 -> 20.6295\n      Hour 18: (20.541000 + 19.344999 + 19.556000 + 23.355000) / 4 = (20.541+19.345+19.556+23.355) = 82.797 -> 20.69925\n      Hour 19: (21.174000 + 14.491000 + 19.275000 + 22.089001) / 4 = (21.174+14.491+19.275+22.089) = 77.029 -> 19.25725\n      Hour 20: (21.385000 + 13.858000 + 19.416000 + 21.525999) / 4 = (21.385+13.858+19.416+21.526) = 76.185 -> 19.04625\n      Hour 21: (21.245001 + 16.601999 + 19.205000 + 22.159000) / 4 = (21.245+16.602+19.205+22.159) = 79.211 -> 19.80275\n      Hour 22: (20.893000 + 16.672001 + 18.712000 + 21.385000) / 4 = (20.893+16.672+18.712+21.385) = 77.662 -> 19.4155\n      Hour 23: (20.190001 + 13.647000 + 19.063999 + 20.823000) / 4 = (20.190+13.647+19.064+20.823) = 73.724 -> 18.431\n\n 32. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n      Day1: 2017-07-12: [19.01125, 19.73225, 19.785, 18.50125, ... , 18.431] (the 24 values for hour0 to hour23)\n      Day2: 2017-07-13: same 24 values\n      Day3: 2017-07-14: same\n      Day4: 2017-07-15: same\n\n 33. But note: the problem says the data has missing values? We are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 34. However, this method does not account for the upward trend in the last day. But without a better method, we use this.\n\n 35. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n 36. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n      Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00, then 2017-07-12 01:00:00, ... until 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n 37. We round the forecasted values to 6 decimal places? The original data had 6 decimal places. But note the original data had up to 3 decimal places? Actually, the original data had 6 decimal places but the values were only up to 3. We'll output 6.\n\n 38. We write the forecast:\n\n      date, OT\n      2017-07-12 00:00:00, 19.011250\n      2017-07-12 01:00:00, 19.732250\n      ... and so on for 96 rows.\n\n 39. But note: the last day in the provided data is 2017-07-11 23:00:00. The next day starts at 2017-07-12 00:00:00.\n\n 40. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n      We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n 41. We list the 24 average values we calculated above in order (hour0 to hour23) and repeat them 4 days.\n\n 42. We must be cautious: the averages we calculated are for the same hour across the 4 days. We have 24 numbers.\n\n 43. We write the forecast:\n\n      <answer>\n        date,OT\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00,19.011250\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00,19.732250\n        2017-07-12 02:00:00,19.785000\n        2017-07-12 03:00:00,18.501250\n        2017-07-12 04:00:00,18.044250\n        2017-07-12 05:00:00,16.830500\n        2017-07-12 06:00:00,18.466000\n        2017-07-12 07:00:00,18.466000\n        2017-07-12 08:00:00,18.941000\n        2017-07-12 09:00:00,19.275250\n        2017-07-12 10:00:00,19.152000\n        2017-07-12 11:00:00,19.785000\n        2017-07-12 12:00:00,19.926000\n        2017-07-12 13:00:00,19.908250\n        2017-07-12 14:00:00,19.996000\n        2017-07-12 15:00:00,20.365500\n        2017-07-12 16:00:00,21.350250\n        2017-07-12 17:00:00,20.629500\n        2017-07-12 18:00:00,20.699250\n        2017-07-12 19:00:00,19.257250\n        2017-07-12 20:00:00,19.046250\n        2017-07-12 21:00:00,19.802750\n        2017-07-12 22:00:00,19.415500\n        2017-07-12 23:00:00,18.431000\n\n        Then for the next day (2017-07-13) we repeat the same 24 numbers:\n\n        2017-07-13 00:00:00,19.011250\n        2017-07-13 01:00:00,19.732250\n        ... and so on.\n\n 44. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 45. However, note that the original data had some fluctuations and our forecast is flat in terms of daily pattern. This is a simple method.\n\n 46. We output the complete 96 points.\n\n 47. We note that this is a naive approach and in practice one would use a more sophisticated model. But given the constraints, we provide this.\n\n 48.
