        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values in general.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we can use a method that can handle missing values, but since the given history is complete, we can use any model.\n\n 2. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. We choose to use SARIMA. We need to determine the order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,s). Since the seasonality is 24 (hourly data with daily seasonality), s=24.\n\n 5. We must be cautious: the data is only 4 days, so 4 seasonal cycles). This is very limited for seasonal models. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we might use a naive seasonal model or a simple average. However, we are experts so we should try to model the pattern.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a linear model with time features (hour of day, day of week) but we only have 4 days (so only one day of the week: starting on a Saturday and ending on a Tuesday). \n    The next 4 days would be Wednesday to Saturday. We don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality, so we focus on daily.\n\n 8. Approach: \n    - We can average the same hour across the 4 days to get a daily profile, then use that profile for the next 4 days? But note: the data starts on 2016-12-24 (Saturday) and ends on 2016-12-27 (Tuesday). \n      The next 4 days are 2016-12-28 (Wednesday) to 2016-12-31 (Saturday). We don't have Wednesday or Thursday in the history, so we cannot use the same day of week. \n    - Instead, we can use the average of the available days for each hour and then adjust for any trend? But the data is very short and we don't see a clear trend.\n\n 9. Let's look at the data: \n    - The values are between -2.277 and 2.411. \n    - We can compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? \n    - However, the pattern might change by day of week, but we don't have enough data to model that.\n\n 10. Given the limitations, we will:\n     Step 1: Create a dataframe with the 96 points.\n     Step 2: Extract the hour of day (0-23) for each record.\n     Step 3: Group by hour and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n 11. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will repeat the computed hourly profile for 4 days.\n\n 12. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n      Day 1 (2016-12-24): average = (sum of 24 values) \n      We can compute quickly: \n        Day1: [2.143, 2.411, 2.344, 1.608, 1.340, 1.340, 1.674, 1.875, 0.938, 0.402, 0.804, 0.737, 0.067, 1.005, 1.340, 0.871, -0.134, -0.536, -0.469, -0.469, -0.536, -1.474, -1.139, -0.603] \n        Sum = 2.143+2.411+2.344+1.608+1.340+1.340+1.674+1.875+0.938+0.402+0.804+0.737+0.067+1.005+1.340+0.871-0.134-0.536-0.469-0.469-0.536-1.474-1.139-0.603\n        Let's calculate step by step:\n          Positive: 2.143+2.411=4.554; +2.344=6.898; +1.608=8.506; +1.340=9.846; +1.340=11.186; +1.674=12.86; +1.875=14.735; +0.938=15.673; +0.402=16.075; +0.804=16.879; +0.737=17.616; +0.067=17.683; +1.005=18.688; +1.340=20.028; +0.871=20.899\n          Negative: -0.134-0.536=-0.67; -0.469=-1.139; -0.469=-1.608; -0.536=-2.144; -1.474=-3.618; -1.139=-4.757; -0.603=-5.36\n          Total = 20.899 - 5.36 = 15.539? But wait, we have more negatives: \n          Actually, the negatives are: -0.134, -0.536, -0.469, -0.469, -0.536, -1.474, -1.139, -0.603 -> sum = -5.36\n          So total for day1: 20.899 (from the positives) but note the positives include up to 0.871? Actually, the list has 24 numbers. The positives are the first 16 and then 8 negatives? \n          Actually, the first 16: from index0 to 15: 16 values? \n          Let me recount: \n            indices 0-15: 16 values? Actually, 0 to 15 is 16? But we have 24. \n          Instead, let me do a quick sum in code style:\n\n          day1 = [2.143, 2.411, 2.344, 1.608, 1.340, 1.340, 1.674, 1.875, 0.938, 0.402, 0.804, 0.737, 0.067, 1.005, 1.340, 0.871, -0.134, -0.536, -0.469, -0.469, -0.536, -1.474, -1.139, -0.603]\n          sum(day1) = 15.539? Actually, let me compute:\n\n          We can do: \n            positive part: 2.143+2.411+2.344+1.608+1.340+1.340+1.674+1.875+0.938+0.402+0.804+0.737+0.067+1.005+1.340+0.871 = \n            Let me add in groups:\n              (2.143+2.411+2.344) = 6.898\n              (1.608+1.340+1.340) = 4.288 -> total=11.186\n              (1.674+1.875) = 3.549 -> total=14.735\n              (0.938+0.402+0.804+0.737) = 2.881 -> total=17.616\n              (0.067+1.005+1.340+0.871) = 3.283 -> total=20.899\n            negative part: -0.134-0.536-0.469-0.469-0.536-1.474-1.139-0.603 = \n              (-0.134-0.536) = -0.67\n              (-0.469-0.469) = -0.938 -> total=-1.608\n              (-0.536) -> total=-2.144\n              (-1.474-1.139) = -2.613 -> total=-4.757\n              (-0.603) -> total=-5.36\n            Total day1 = 20.899 - 5.36 = 15.539\n\n          Average for day1 = 15.539/24 = 0.647458\n\n      Day2: 2016-12-25: \n        [0.402,0.134,0.201,-0.402,0.402,-0.067,-0.402,-0.469,0.000,0.469,0.469,0.536,0.000,0.536,-0.134,0.402,-0.335,-0.402,-0.603,-0.737,-1.005,-2.076,-0.134,0.670]\n        Sum = \n          positive: 0.402+0.134+0.201+0.402+0.469+0.469+0.536+0.536+0.402+0.670 = \n            0.402+0.134=0.536; +0.201=0.737; +0.402=1.139; +0.469=1.608; +0.469=2.077; +0.536=2.613; +0.536=3.149; +0.402=3.551; +0.670=4.221\n          negative: -0.402-0.067-0.402-0.469-0.335-0.402-0.603-0.737-1.005-2.076-0.134 = \n            -0.402-0.067=-0.469; -0.402=-0.871; -0.469=-1.34; -0.335=-1.675; -0.402=-2.077; -0.603=-2.68; -0.737=-3.417; -1.005=-4.422; -2.076=-6.498; -0.134=-6.632\n          Total = 4.221 - 6.632 = -2.411\n          Average = -2.411/24 = -0.100458\n\n      Day3: 2016-12-26:\n        [1.741,1.674,1.875,1.474,0.402,0.536,0.000,-0.871,0.737,0.603,0.938,0.670,0.268,0.603,0.871,0.737,0.134,-0.134,-0.536,-0.536,-0.804,-2.277,-0.067,0.067]\n        Sum = \n          positive: 1.741+1.674+1.875+1.474+0.402+0.536+0.737+0.603+0.938+0.670+0.268+0.603+0.871+0.737+0.134+0.067 = \n            (1.741+1.674)=3.415; +1.875=5.29; +1.474=6.764; +0.402=7.166; +0.536=7.702; +0.737=8.439; +0.603=9.042; +0.938=9.98; +0.670=10.65; +0.268=10.918; +0.603=11.521; +0.871=12.392; +0.737=13.129; +0.134=13.263; +0.067=13.33\n          negative: -0.871-0.134-0.536-0.536-0.804-2.277 = \n            -0.871-0.134=-1.005; -0.536=-1.541; -0.536=-2.077; -0.804=-2.881; -2.277=-5.158\n          Total = 13.33 - 5.158 = 8.172\n          Average = 8.172/24 = 0.3405\n\n      Day4: 2016-12-27:\n        [0.335,0.938,0.603,0.335,0.603,0.938,0.536,0.603,0.737,1.741,1.139,1.608,0.268,1.072,1.407,0.536,0.871,0.268,0.000,-0.067,-0.402,-0.603,1.608,0.871]\n        Sum = \n          positive: 0.335+0.938+0.603+0.335+0.603+0.938+0.536+0.603+0.737+1.741+1.139+1.608+0.268+1.072+1.407+0.536+0.871+0.268+1.608+0.871\n          Let's add: \n            0.335+0.938=1.273; +0.603=1.876; +0.335=2.211; +0.603=2.814; +0.938=3.752; +0.536=4.288; +0.603=4.891; +0.737=5.628; +1.741=7.369; +1.139=8.508; +1.608=10.116; +0.268=10.384; +1.072=11.456; +1.407=12.863; +0.536=13.399; +0.871=14.27; +0.268=14.538; +1.608=16.146; +0.871=17.017\n          negative: -0.067-0.402-0.603 = -1.072\n          Total = 17.017 - 1.072 = 15.945\n          Average = 15.945/24 = 0.664375\n\n      The daily averages: [0.647, -0.100, 0.340, 0.664] -> no clear trend? \n\n 13. Therefore, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a daily profile.\n\n 14. Steps for the forecast:\n      For hour 0 (00:00): average of [2.143 (day1), 0.402 (day2), 1.741 (day3), 0.335 (day4)] = (2.143+0.402+1.741+0.335)/4 = 4.621/4 = 1.15525\n      Similarly for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n 15. Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n        Day1 (2016-12-28): hour0 to hour23: the profile we computed.\n        Day2 (2016-12-29): same profile\n        Day3 (2016-12-30): same profile\n        Day4 (2016-12-31): same profile\n\n 16. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data to capture weekly. Also, the next days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. \n      In the history, we have:\n        Saturday (2016-12-24), Sunday (2016-12-25), Monday (2016-12-26), Tuesday (2016-12-27)\n      The next days: \n        2016-12-28: Wednesday\n        2016-12-29: Thursday\n        2016-12-30: Friday\n        2016-12-31: Saturday\n\n      We have one Saturday in the history (2016-12-24) and the next Saturday is 2016-12-31. So for Saturday, we can use the profile from 2016-12-24? \n      But we are only given 4 days, so we don't have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday in the history. \n\n 17. Given the data limitation, we stick to the overall hourly average.\n\n 18.

Now, we create the forecast for the next 96 hours (from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00) by repeating the above hourly profile for 4 days.\n\n 20.

We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 23. Format:\n\n        date                HULL\n        2016-12-28 00:00:00 1.15525\n        2016-12-28 01:00:00 1.28925\n        ... \n        2016-12-28 23:00:00 0.25125\n        2016-12-29 00:00:00 1.15525\n        ... and so on.\n\n 24. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places. So we round to 3.\n\n 25. Let's create the list:\n\n      Day1: 2016-12-28\n        hour0: 1.155 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 1.155\n        hour1: 1.289 -> 1.289\n        hour2: 1.256 -> 1.256 (because 1.25575 rounded to 3 decimals: 1.256)\n        hour3: 0.754\n        hour4: 0.687\n        hour5: 0.687\n        hour6: 0.452\n        hour7: 0.285\n        hour8: 0.603\n        hour9: 0.804\n        hour10: 0.838\n        hour11: 0.888\n        hour12: 0.151\n        hour13: 0.804\n        hour14: 0.871\n        hour15: 0.637\n        hour16: 0.134\n        hour17: -0.201\n        hour18: -0.402\n        hour19: -0.452\n        hour20: -0.687\n        hour21: -1.608\n        hour22: 0.067\n        hour23: 0.251\n\n      Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 26. But note: the last day of the forecast (2016-12-31) is a Saturday. We have one Saturday in the history (2016-12-24). \n      We could use the data from 2016-12-24 for 2016-12-31? But the problem is we don't have other weekdays. \n      Since we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality, we stick to the average.\n\n 27. We output the data.\n\n 28. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. \n      And we are forecasting without any missing values.\n\n 29. We write the forecast in the next 96 points.\n\n 30. We must output in the required XML-like format.\n\n 31. Let's code the output:\n\n      We'll generate the dates first: \n        start = datetime(2016, 28, 12) -> but wait, the last date in the input is 2016-12-27 23:00:00, so next is 2016-12-28 00:00:00.\n\n      We need 96 hours: \n        from 2016-12-28 00:00:00 to 2016-12-31 23:00:00.\n\n      We have the hourly profile as a list of 24 values (rounded to 3 decimals) as above.\n\n      Then we repeat that list 4 times.\n\n 32. The list of forecasted values (hourly profile repeated 4 times) is:\n\n        [1.155, 1.289, 1.256, 0.754, 0.687, 0.687, 0.452, 0.285, 0.603, 0.804, 0.838, 0.888, 0.151, 0.804, 0.871, 0.637, 0.134, -0.201, -0.402, -0.452, -0.687, -1.608, 0.067, 0.251] \n        and then repeated 4 times.\n\n 33. We generate the dates:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016, 12, 28)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n\n 34. Format the date: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 35. We write the output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-12-28 00:00:00 1.155\n        2016-12-28 01:00:00 1.289\n        ... \n        2016-12-31 23:00:00 0.251\n        </answer>\n\n 36. But note: the example input had a space and then the value. We'll use the same.\n\n 37. However, the example input had the value with 3 decimal places. We rounded to 3.\n\n 38. Let's do it.\n\n 39. We note: the rounding might cause slight discrepancy because we computed the average and then rounded. \n      But the input data was given to 3 decimals, so we output 3.\n\n 40. We output the complete 96 lines.\n\n 41. We must not omit any.\n\n 42. Code for the dates and the repeated profile:\n\n      dates = []\n      values = [1.155, 1.289, 1.256, 0.754, 0.687, 0.687, 0.452, 0.285, 0.603, 0.804, 0.838, 0.888, 0.151, 0.804, 0.871, 0.637, 0.134, -0.201, -0.402, -0.452, -0.687, -1.608, 0.067, 0.251]\n\n      for day in range(4):\n          for hour in range(24):\n              date_str = (datetime(2016, 12, 28) + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n              value = values[hour]\n              print(f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\")   # but we already rounded the values, so we can just use the list\n\n      However, we have the list of values as numbers, and we want to output with 3 decimals. We'll format each value to have 3 decimal places.\n\n 43. But note: the value -1.608 is already at 3 decimals, but 0.067 is 0.067 -> we want 0.067? \n      In the input, they had 3 decimal places even if the last digit is zero? \n      Example: 0.067, 0.000, etc.\n\n      We'll format to 3 decimal places: \n          \"{:.3f}\".format(x) will give 0.067 -> '0.067', 0.067 is the same as 0.0670? but we output 0.067? \n          Actually, the input had 0.067, so we output 0.067.\n\n      However, the formatting with .3f will output 0.067 as '0.067', which is 3 decimal places? \n          It has 3 digits after the decimal? 0.067 has 3 digits: 0,6,7? \n          But 0.067 is 6.7e-2, so when we do .3f, it will show 0.067 -> that's 3 digits: 0,6,7 -> so it's correct.\n\n      But for 0.25125 rounded to 0.251 -> that's 3 decimals.\n\n 44. We are ready.\n\n 45. However, note: the input had negative values with a minus sign, and we have negatives.\n\n 46. We output the data.\n\n 47. We must enclose in <answer> and </answer> and use the exact format.\n\n 48. We write the answer.\n",
