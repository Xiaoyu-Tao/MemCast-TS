        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, in the provided data, there are no missing timestamps? Let's check: \n    - The data starts at 2016-09-07 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-09-10 23:00:00. \n    - 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points. So the given data is complete for 96 points.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 3. Since the data is time series with hourly frequency, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the data size is small (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points ahead, we can use a model that can capture seasonality and trend.\n\n 4. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be daily seasonality (24 hours). The values fluctuate in a pattern that repeats every day.\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal model. One common approach is to use the seasonal naive method, but that might not capture the pattern well. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or even a simple average by hour of day.\n\n 6. However, note that the data has some irregularities (like the drop on 2016-09-09 05:00:00 2.274, then 06:00:00 2.097, which is lower than the surrounding). We must be cautious.\n\n 7. Given the constraints and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we can do:\n\n    Option 1: Use the average of each hour across the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    For example, for hour 00:00:00, we have:\n        2016-09-07 00:00:00: 3.198\n        2016-09-08 00:00:00: 3.020\n        2016-09-09 00:00:00: 4.833\n        2016-09-10 00:00:00: 3.838\n        Average = (3.198+3.020+4.833+3.838)/4 = 3.72225\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, for the hour 00:00:00, we use 3.72225.\n\n    Similarly for other hours.\n\n    But note: the data might have a stable pattern? However, we see that the values for the same hour vary. Also, the last day (2016-09-10) has a different pattern? \n\n    Option 2: Use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing for the entire series.\n\n 8. Considering the requirement for a complete set and the possibility of missing values in the future (but we are to forecast without gaps), we can use the average by hour.\n\n 9. Steps for the average by hour method:\n    - Group the data by the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n    - For each hour, compute the average of the 4 available values (from the 4 days).\n    - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 10. However, note that the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a long-term trend. Also, the seasonality is daily, so this method is simple and robust.\n\n 11. Let's try to see if there is a trend: \n        The first day (2016-09-07) has a range of [1.564, 4.158]\n        The second day: [1.670, 3.909]? Actually, the second day max is 3.909? But we have 3.767 and 3.731? \n        The third day: [1.137, 5.224] -> note the drop at 05:00 and 06:00? \n        The fourth day: [1.812, 4.371]? \n\n     It's no clear trend over the 4 days. So the average might be acceptable.\n\n 12. We'll compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 13. How to handle if there are missing values in the provided data? The provided data has 96 points and no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n 14. Compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (3.198 + 3.020 + 4.833 + 3.838) / 4 = 3.72225\n     Hour 1: (2.985 + 3.447 + 4.620 + 3.909) / 4 = 3.74025\n     Hour 2: (3.234 + 3.838 + 4.975 + 4.300) / 4 = 4.08675\n     Hour 3: (2.701 + 2.914 + 4.726 + 3.447) / 4 = 3.447\n     Hour 4: (3.198 + 3.127 + 5.224 + 3.340) / 4 = 3.72225\n     Hour 5: (2.878 + 2.452 + 2.274 + 3.482) / 4 = 2.7715\n     Hour 6: (3.376 + 3.625 + 2.097 + 2.914) / 4 = 3.003\n     Hour 7: (4.158 + 3.056 + 1.848 + 3.020) / 4 = 3.0205\n     Hour 8: (3.020 + 2.736 + 2.203 + 3.625) / 4 = 2.896\n     Hour 9: (3.376 + 3.092 + 1.137 + 3.447) / 4 = 2.763\n     Hour 10: (3.447 + 2.843 + 3.127 + 3.696) / 4 = 3.27825\n     Hour 11: (2.949 + 3.198 + 2.914 + 3.269) / 4 = 3.0825\n     Hour 12: (1.599 + 1.670 + 1.883 + 2.594) / 4 = 1.9365\n     Hour 13: (2.239 + 1.848 + 2.665 + 1.812) / 4 = 2.141\n     Hour 14: (2.097 + 2.132 + 2.701 + 3.092) / 4 = 2.5055\n     Hour 15: (2.559 + 2.487 + 3.234 + 2.807) / 4 = 2.77175\n     Hour 16: (2.487 + 2.416 + 2.701 + 2.630) / 4 = 2.5585\n     Hour 17: (2.381 + 2.594 + 2.452 + 2.878) / 4 = 2.57625\n     Hour 18: (2.132 + 2.025 + 2.132 + 2.594) / 4 = 2.22075\n     Hour 19: (1.564 + 2.239 + 2.132 + 2.168) / 4 = 2.02575\n     Hour 20: (1.812 + 2.239 + 2.203 + 2.310) / 4 = 2.141\n     Hour 21: (1.812 + 2.381 + 1.706 + 1.883) / 4 = 1.9455\n     Hour 22: (1.954 + 3.767 + 3.411 + 4.371) / 4 = 3.37575\n     Hour 23: (3.092 + 3.731 + 3.163 + 2.807) / 4 = 3.19825\n\n 15. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours (from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00) by repeating the above averages for each hour for 4 days.\n\n 16. The dates will be:\n        Day 1: 2016-09-11 (starting at 00:00:00 to 23:00:00)\n        Day 2: 2016-09-12\n        Day 3: 2016-09-13\n        Day 4: 2016-09-14\n\n 17. We'll assign:\n        2016-09-11 00:00:00: 3.72225\n        2016-09-11 01:00:00: 3.74025\n        ... and so on for 24 hours, then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 18. But note: the pattern might not be exactly the same? However, without a more sophisticated model, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 19. We must format the output exactly as the input, but for the next 96 dates.\n\n 20. We'll generate the dates in the same hourly frequency.\n\n 21. Let's write the data:\n\n        date, MULL\n        2016-09-11 00:00:00, 3.72225\n        2016-09-11 01:00:00, 3.74025\n        2016-09-11 02:00:00, 4.08675\n        2016-09-11 03:00:00, 3.447\n        2016-09-11 04:00:00, 3.72225\n        2016-09-11 05:00:00, 2.7715\n        2016-09-11 06:00:00, 3.003\n        2016-09-11 07:00:00, 3.0205\n        2016-09-11 08:00:00, 2.896\n        2016-09-11 09:00:00, 2.763\n        2016-09-11 10:00:00, 3.27825\n        2016-09-11 11:00:00, 3.0825\n        2016-09-11 12:00:00, 1.9365\n        2016-09-11 13:00:00, 2.141\n        2016-09-11 14:00:00, 2.5055\n        2016-09-11 15:00:00, 2.77175\n        2016-09-11 16:00:00, 2.5585\n        2016-09-11 17:00:00, 2.57625\n        2016-09-11 18:00:00, 2.22075\n        2016-09-11 19:00:00, 2.02575\n        2016-09-11 20:00:00, 2.141\n        2016-09-11 21:00:00, 1.9455\n        2016-09-11 22:00:00, 3.37575\n        2016-09-11 23:00:00, 3.19825\n\n    Then repeat the same 24 values for 2016-09-12, 2016-09-13, 2016-09-14.\n\n 22. However, note: the last day in the provided data is 2016-09-10. The next day is 2016-09-11.\n\n 23. We'll generate 4 days of data.\n\n 24. We must output the data in the same format, with the same precision? The input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 25. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Hour 0: 3.722\n    Hour 1: 3.740\n    Hour 2: 4.087\n    Hour 3: 3.447\n    Hour 4: 3.722\n    Hour 5: 2.772\n    Hour 6: 3.003\n    Hour 7: 3.020\n    Hour 8: 2.896\n    Hour 9: 2.763\n    Hour 10: 3.278\n    Hour 11: 3.082\n    Hour 12: 1.936\n    Hour 13: 2.141\n    Hour 14: 2.506\n    Hour 15: 2.772\n    Hour 16: 2.558\n    Hour 17: 2.576\n    Hour 18: 2.221\n    Hour 19: 2.026\n    Hour 20: 2.141\n    Hour 21: 1.946\n    Hour 22: 3.376\n    Hour 23: 3.198\n\n 26. Now, we write the next 96 points.\n\n 27. We must output in the exact structure as the input, with the same columns: 'date' and 'MULL'.\n\n 28. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        start = 2016-09-11 00:00:00\n        end   = 2016-09-14 23:00:00\n\n 29. We'll create a list of dates for 96 hours starting from 2016-09-11 00:00:00.\n\n 30. Then assign the MULL values by repeating the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 31. Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date                MULL\n        2016-09-11 00:00:00 3.722\n        2016-09-11 01:00:00 3.740\n        ... \n\n 32. We must not omit any content, so we write all 96 lines.\n\n 33. Let's code the output.\n\n 34. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided data we don't have any. And we are to forecast without gaps. So we output 96 consecutive points.\n\n 35. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n",
