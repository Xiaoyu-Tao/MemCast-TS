        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00) for the \"MULL\" (Middle UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 to 2016-11-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, we see that on 2016-10-31, the value is constant (2.594) for 24 hours. \n    This might indicate a problem (e.g., sensor failure) or it might be a holiday? However, we are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 2. Since the data is time series with hourly frequency, we can consider using time series forecasting methods. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the presence of potential anomalies, \n    we need a method that can handle the data and provide 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We note that the data shows:\n    - Diurnal patterns: higher during the day and lower at night? But looking at the data, the pattern is not very clear. For example, on 2016-10-29, the values are higher in the early hours and then drop in the evening.\n    - There is a constant value for an entire day (2016-10-31) which is unusual.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    a) We can use an ARIMA model, but with 96 points and 96 steps ahead, it might be challenging. Also, the constant day might break the pattern.\n    b) Alternatively, we can use a simple method like Exponential Smoothing, or even a naive seasonal method.\n\n 5. However, note that the data has a constant block. We must decide how to handle it. Since we are forecasting, we can treat the constant as an anomaly and use the rest of the data.\n\n 6. Considering the requirement for 96 forecasts and the potential seasonality (daily seasonality with period=24), we can use a seasonal method.\n\n 7. We choose to use the Seasonal Naive method as a baseline: each forecast is set to the value of the same hour in the previous day. But note that the previous day (2016-11-01) is not constant, so we can use that.\n\n    However, the day before the constant day (2016-10-30) and the day after (2016-11-01) are available. But the constant day (2016-10-31) is in between.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the non-constant days to build a model. Let's consider the days:\n\n    Day 1: 2016-10-29 (24 hours)\n    Day 2: 2016-10-30 (24 hours)\n    Day 3: 2016-10-31 (constant 2.594 for 24 hours) -> we might skip this for modeling?\n    Day 4: 2016-11-01 (24 hours)\n\n 9. We are to forecast the next 4 days (2016-11-02 to 2016-11-05). We can use the average of the same hour from the available days (2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, 2016-11-01) for each hour.\n\n    But note: 2016-10-29 and 2016-10-30 are Saturday and Sunday, and 2016-11-01 is Tuesday. The next days (2016-11-02 to 2016-11-05) are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n    Without more data, it's hard to capture weekly seasonality. We only have one instance of each day of the week? So we might ignore weekly seasonality and just use daily.\n\n 10. We decide to use the average of the three non-constant days (2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, 2016-11-01) for each hour to forecast the next four days.\n\n     However, note that 2016-11-01 is a Tuesday and the next days are Wednesday to Saturday. We don't have a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday in our training? We have:\n\n        Saturday: 2016-10-29\n        Sunday: 2016-10-30\n        Tuesday: 2016-11-01\n\n     We are missing Monday (which was constant) and then we have no example.\n\n 11. Given the complexity and the limited data, we might use the average of the three available days for each hour to represent a typical day, and then use that for the next four days.\n\n     Steps:\n        For hour h (where h from 0 to 23):\n            value_h = (value_h from 2016-10-29 + value_h from 2016-10-30 + value_h from 2016-11-01) / 3\n\n        Then, for each day in the forecast period (4 days), we assign the value_h for the corresponding hour.\n\n 12. But note: the data for 2016-11-01 is the day after the constant day and it shows a different pattern (lower values). So we have:\n\n        Hour 0: (3.305 + 2.665 + 3.589) / 3 = (3.305+2.665+3.589)/3 = 9.559/3 = 3.186333\n        Hour 1: (2.843 + 2.452 + 3.092) /3 = (2.843+2.452+3.092)/3 = 8.387/3 = 2.795667\n        ... and so on.\n\n 13. Then we create:\n\n        2016-11-02 00:00:00: 3.186333\n        2016-11-02 01:00:00: 2.795667\n        ... for 24 hours.\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days (2016-11-03, 2016-11-04, 2016-11-05).\n\n 14. However, this method ignores any trend and the fact that the last day (2016-11-01) is lower. But without more data, it's a simple approach.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2016-11-01) as the pattern for the next days? But that day is a Tuesday and the next day is Wednesday, which we don't have.\n\n 16. Considering the instructions and the simplicity, we go with the average of the three non-constant days.\n\n 17. But note: the constant day (2016-10-31) is 24 constant values. We are not using it because it is an anomaly.\n\n 18. We calculate the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (3.305 + 2.665 + 3.589) / 3 = 3.186333\n        hour1: (2.843 + 2.452 + 3.092) / 3 = 2.795667\n        hour2: (2.985 + 2.630 + 3.482) / 3 = 3.032333\n        hour3: (2.985 + 2.878 + 3.198) / 3 = 3.020333\n        hour4: (2.487 + 2.949 + 2.452) / 3 = 2.629333\n        hour5: (2.914 + 2.061 + 2.630) / 3 = 2.535\n        hour6: (2.452 + 2.203 + 1.919) / 3 = 2.191333\n        hour7: (3.340 + 2.381 + 0.746) / 3 = 2.155667\n        hour8: (3.127 + 2.132 + 1.137) / 3 = 2.132\n        hour9: (1.457 + 1.670 + 0.426) / 3 = 1.184333\n        hour10: (2.559 + 1.066 + 0.995) / 3 = 1.54\n        hour11: (1.990 + 1.315 + 0.746) / 3 = 1.350333\n        hour12: (2.097 + 0.675 + 0.640) / 3 = 1.137333\n        hour13: (2.239 + 1.599 + 0.782) / 3 = 1.54\n        hour14: (1.990 + 2.843 + 0.853) / 3 = 1.895333\n        hour15: (1.386 + 1.706 + 0.320) / 3 = 1.137333\n        hour16: (1.528 + 1.741 + 0.071) / 3 = 1.113333\n        hour17: (1.635 + 1.244 -0.107) / 3 = 0.924\n        hour18: (1.244 + 1.208 + 0.569) / 3 = 1.007\n        hour19: (1.066 + 1.208 + 0.497) / 3 = 0.923667\n        hour20: (1.031 + 0.640 + 0.391) / 3 = 0.687333\n        hour21: (0.604 + 0.071 + 0.959) / 3 = 0.544667\n        hour22: (2.132 + 1.279 + 0.817) / 3 = 1.409333\n        hour23: (1.386 + 1.137 + 0.853) / 3 = 1.125333\n\n 19. Then we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 20. The dates for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-02 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-11-01 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-11-02 01:00:00 ... until 2016-11-05 23:00:00.\n\n 21. We write the data in the same format.\n\n 22. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 23. Let's create the forecast:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-02\n           00:00:00 -> 3.186\n           01:00:00 -> 2.796\n           ... (using the averages above, rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n        Day 2: 2016-11-03: same 24 numbers\n        Day 3: 2016-11-04: same\n        Day 4: 2016-11-05: same\n\n 24. But note: the average for hour1: 2.795667 rounded to 3 decimals is 2.796? \n        Actually, 2.795667 rounded to 3 decimals: \n           2.795667 -> look at the 4th decimal is 6 (>=5) so round up: 2.796\n\n 25. We do the same for all.\n\n 26. However, we must be cautious: the data on 2016-11-01 has negative values? (e.g., -0.107). Our average for hour17 is 0.924, which is positive.\n\n 27. We generate the data accordingly.\n\n 28. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't have missing values (we have 96 points). \n     However, the constant day might be considered as missing? But we are not use it. We are using the three non-constant days.\n\n 29. We output the next 96 points.\n\n 30. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-02 00:00:00  <value>\n2016-11-02 01:00:00  <value>\n...\n2016-11-05 23:00:00  <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 31. We must provide the complete data.\n\n Let's compute the averages and round:\n\n    hour0: 3.186333 -> 3.186\n    hour1: 2.795667 -> 2.796\n    hour2: 3.032333 -> 3.032\n    hour3: 3.020333 -> 3.020\n    hour4: 2.629333 -> 2.629\n    hour5: 2.535 -> 2.535\n    hour6: 2.191333 -> 2.191\n    hour7: 2.155667 -> 2.156\n    hour8: 2.132 -> 2.132\n    hour9: 1.184333 -> 1.184\n    hour10: 1.54 -> 1.540\n    hour11: 1.350333 -> 1.350\n    hour12: 1.137333 -> 1.137\n    hour13: 1.54 -> 1.540\n    hour14: 1.895333 -> 1.895\n    hour15: 1.137333 -> 1.137\n    hour16: 1.113333 -> 1.113\n    hour17: 0.924 -> 0.924\n    hour18: 1.007 -> 1.007\n    hour19: 0.923667 -> 0.924\n    hour20: 0.687333 -> 0.687\n    hour21: 0.544667 -> 0.545\n    hour22: 1.409333 -> 1.409\n    hour23: 1.125333 -> 1.125\n\n 32. Now we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-02: [3.186, 2.796, 3.032, 3.020, 2.629, 2.535, 2.191, 2.156, 2.132, 1.184, 1.540, 1.350, 1.137, 1.540, 1.895, 1.137, 1.113, 0.924, 1.007, 0.924, 0.687, 0.545, 1.409, 1.125]\n        Day 2: 2016-11-03: same\n        Day 3: 2016-11-04: same\n        Day 4: 2016-11-05: same\n\n 33. We write the dates accordingly.\n\n 34. We must be careful: the last date in the input is 2016-11-01 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-11-02 00:00:00.\n\n 35. We generate the data.\n\n 36. Note: We are not using any sophisticated model because of the limited data and the anomaly. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 37. Write the output in the format.\n",
