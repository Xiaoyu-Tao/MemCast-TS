        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to predict the next 96 hours.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (all 96 are present).\n 3. We must generate 96 forecasted values starting from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use an appropriate model. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon for such a short history), we need a model that can capture seasonality and trends.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours) and also some weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern cannot be captured.\n   - We can try to use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data is only 4 days. We can use a simple model like:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the value from the same hour of the previous day.\n   - But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the past 4 days? Or use the last available day (day 4) as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided data, there are none, so we can proceed.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can use the entire first day (2017-02-14) as the next day (2017-02-18), then the second day (2017-02-15) for 2017-02-19, and so on? But that would be a naive repetition.\n\n However, we can also that the data does not look exactly the same every day. Therefore, we might consider a model that captures the daily pattern but also the trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n Let me define:\n   For hour h (0 to 23), the forecast for the next day (day 5) at hour h = average of hour h from day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n But note: we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours). So:\n   Day 5 (2017-02-18) hour h: average of day1 (2017-02-14), day2 (2017-02-15), day3 (2017-02-16), day4 (2017-02-17) at hour h.\n   Similarly, for day6 (2017-02-19) we would use the same? But we don't have day5 observed. So we cannot use a moving average that requires future data.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n   For the first forecasted day (2017-02-18): use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days.\n   For the second forecasted day (2017-02-19): we don't have 2017-02-18 observed, so we can use the same average? Or we can use the average of the past 4 days (which now would include the first forecasted day? But that would be using forecasted values to forecast, which might lead to drift).\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same average for all 4 forecasted days? That is, for each hour in the day, we use the average of that hour from the 4 historical days.\n\n This method is simple and handles the seasonality.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   For hour 0: ( -0.201 + 0.000 + 0.938 + 1.005 ) / 4 = ( -0.201 + 0.000 = -0.201; +0.938=0.737; +1.005=1.742) -> 1.742/4 = 0.4355\n   For hour 1: (0.201 + 0.067 + 0.335 + 1.340) /4 = (0.201+0.067=0.268; +0.335=0.603; +1.340=1.943) -> 1.943/4 = 0.48575\n\n But note: the data has 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimals.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with 4 days, it's hard to tell.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. But given the constraints (only 4 days of history) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we choose a simple method: using the average of the same hour over the available 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   For each hour in [0,23]:\n        avg_h = average of the HULL values at that hour for the 4 days (2017-02-14, 2017-02-15, 2017-02-16, 2017-02-17)\n\n   Then, for each day in the forecast period (2017-02-18 to 2017-02-21), at hour h, we set HULL = avg_h.\n\n But note: the data shows that the values are not constant per hour? For example, the first day at 0:00 is -0.201, the second day 0:00 is 0.000, the third is 0.938, the fourth is 1.005. The average is 0.4355. Then the next 4 days at 0:00 will all be 0.436 (rounded).\n\n However, we can also consider that the last day (2017-02-17) might be more representative? But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (-0.201 + 0.000 + 0.938 + 1.005) /4 = ( -0.201+0.000 = -0.201; -0.201+0.938=0.737; 0.737+1.005=1.742) -> 1.742/4 = 0.4355 -> 0.436\n Hour 1: (0.201 + 0.067 + 0.335 + 1.340) /4 = (0.201+0.067=0.268; 0.268+0.335=0.603; 0.603+1.340=1.943) -> 1.943/4 = 0.48575 -> 0.486\n Hour 2: (-0.469 + -0.670 + 0.804 + 1.608) /4 = (-0.469-0.670=-1.139; -1.139+0.804=-0.335; -0.335+1.608=1.273) -> 1.273/4 = 0.31825 -> 0.318\n Hour 3: (-0.603 + -0.737 + -1.005 + 1.340) /4 = (-0.603-0.737=-1.340; -1.340-1.005=-2.345; -2.345+1.340=-1.005) -> -1.005/4 = -0.25125 -> -0.251\n Hour 4: (-0.402 + -1.139 + 0.201 + 1.005) /4 = (-0.402-1.139=-1.541; -1.541+0.201=-1.340; -1.340+1.005=-0.335) -> -0.335/4 = -0.08375 -> -0.084\n Hour 5: (0.000 + -0.938 + -1.072 + 0.268) /4 = (0.000-0.938=-0.938; -0.938-1.072=-2.010; -2.010+0.268=-1.742) -> -1.742/4 = -0.4355 -> -0.436\n Hour 6: (0.000 + -0.737 + -1.072 + 0.402) /4 = (0.000-0.737=-0.737; -0.737-1.072=-1.809; -1.809+0.402=-1.407) -> -1.407/4 = -0.35175 -> -0.352\n Hour 7: (0.134 + -1.206 + -0.402 + 1.139) /4 = (0.134-1.206=-1.072; -1.072-0.402=-1.474; -1.474+1.139=-0.335) -> -0.335/4 = -0.08375 -> -0.084\n Hour 8: (0.603 + -0.201 + 0.067 + 1.942) /4 = (0.603-0.201=0.402; 0.402+0.067=0.469; 0.469+1.942=2.411) -> 2.411/4 = 0.60275 -> 0.603\n Hour 9: (0.536 + 0.000 + 0.000 + 1.005) /4 = (0.536+0.000=0.536; 0.536+0.000=0.536; 0.536+1.005=1.541) -> 1.541/4 = 0.38525 -> 0.385\n Hour 10: (-0.201 + 0.536 + 0.536 + 0.335) /4 = (-0.201+0.536=0.335; 0.335+0.536=0.871; 0.871+0.335=1.206) -> 1.206/4 = 0.3015 -> 0.302\n Hour 11: (0.536 + 0.938 + 0.536 + 0.335) /4 = (0.536+0.938=1.474; 1.474+0.536=2.010; 2.010+0.335=2.345) -> 2.345/4 = 0.58625 -> 0.586\n Hour 12: (1.005 + 0.402 + 0.201 + -0.670) /4 = (1.005+0.402=1.407; 1.407+0.201=1.608; 1.608-0.670=0.938) -> 0.938/4 = 0.2345 -> 0.235\n Hour 13: (0.804 + 1.072 + 1.139 + 0.134) /4 = (0.804+1.072=1.876; 1.876+1.139=3.015; 3.015+0.134=3.149) -> 3.149/4 = 0.78725 -> 0.787\n Hour 14: (-0.670 + 0.737 + 0.804 + 0.134) /4 = (-0.670+0.737=0.067; 0.067+0.804=0.871; 0.871+0.134=1.005) -> 1.005/4 = 0.25125 -> 0.251\n Hour 15: (-0.469 + 0.201 + 0.201 + 0.067) /4 = (-0.469+0.201=-0.268; -0.268+0.201=-0.067; -0.067+0.067=0.000) -> 0.000/4 = 0.000\n Hour 16: (-0.469 + -0.335 + -0.938 + -0.603) /4 = (-0.469-0.335=-0.804; -0.804-0.938=-1.742; -1.742-0.603=-2.345) -> -2.345/4 = -0.58625 -> -0.586\n Hour 17: (-1.072 + -0.871 + -0.603 + -0.268) /4 = (-1.072-0.871=-1.943; -1.943-0.603=-2.546; -2.546-0.268=-2.814) -> -2.814/4 = -0.7035 -> -0.704\n Hour 18: (-1.942 + -1.674 + -1.139 + -0.938) /4 = (-1.942-1.674=-3.616; -3.616-1.139=-4.755; -4.755-0.938=-5.693) -> -5.693/4 = -1.42325 -> -1.423\n Hour 19: (-1.206 + -0.938 + -1.340 + -0.938) /4 = (-1.206-0.938=-2.144; -2.144-1.340=-3.484; -3.484-0.938=-4.422) -> -4.422/4 = -1.1055 -> -1.106\n Hour 20: (-0.938 + -1.206 + -1.206 + -1.005) /4 = (-0.938-1.206=-2.144; -2.144-1.206=-3.350; -3.350-1.005=-4.355) -> -4.355/4 = -1.08875 -> -1.089\n Hour 21: (-1.273 + -1.206 + -0.603 + -1.541) /4 = (-1.273-1.206=-2.479; -2.479-0.603=-3.082; -3.082-1.541=-4.623) -> -4.623/4 = -1.15575 -> -1.156\n Hour 22: (-0.402 + -1.474 + -0.469 + -0.335) /4 = (-0.402-1.474=-1.876; -1.876-0.469=-2.345; -2.345-0.335=-2.680) -> -2.680/4 = -0.670\n Hour 23: (-0.335 + 0.000 + 0.536 + -0.536) /4 = (-0.335+0.000=-0.335; -0.335+0.536=0.201; 0.201-0.536=-0.335) -> -0.335/4 = -0.08375 -> -0.084\n\n Now, we create the next 4 days (2017-02-18 to 2017-02-21) with the same hour averages.\n\n 2017-02-18 00:00:00 -> 0.436\n 2017-02-18 01:00:00 -> 0.486\n ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n Then 2017-02-19: same as above for each hour.\n 2017-02-20: same.\n 2017-02-21: same.\n\n We generate 96 points.\n\n However, note: the last provided data point is 2017-02-17 23:00:00. The next should be 2017-02-18 00:00:00.\n\n We write the dates accordingly.\n\n But note: 2017 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So 2017-02-18 is valid.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Start date: 2017-02-18 00:00:00\n   End date: 2017-02-21 23:00:00\n\n   We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n   For each day in [18,19,20,21] of February 2017:\n        for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n            date = \"2017-02-{day} {hour}:00:00\" (with day as two-digit, hour as two-digit? Actually, the format is like \"2017-02-18 00:00:00\")\n\n   And the HULL value for a given hour is the average we computed for that hour.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n   Day 18: \n        00:00:00 -> 0.436\n        01:00:00 -> 0.486\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> -0.084\n\n   Then day 19: same set of averages.\n\n   Day 20: same.\n\n   Day 21: same.\n\n We output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL', with the date as string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and HULL as a number with 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the original data had HULL with 3 decimal places.\n\n We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, note: we computed the averages and rounded to 3 decimal places above.\n\n Let me write the averages for each hour (0 to 23) as a list: \n  0: 0.436\n  1: 0.486\n  2: 0.318\n  3: -0.251\n  4: -0.084\n  5: -0.436\n  6: -0.352\n  7: -0.084\n  8: 0.603\n  9: 0.385\n 10: 0.302\n 11: 0.586\n 12: 0.235\n 13: 0.787\n 14: 0.251\n 15: 0.000\n 16: -0.586\n 17: -0.704\n 18: -1.423\n 19: -1.106\n 20: -1.089\n 21: -1.156\n 22: -0.670\n 23: -0.084\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 points:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-02-18, hours 0 to 23 -> use the list above in order.\n   Day 2: 2017-02-19, same list.\n   Day 3: 2017-02-20, same list.\n   Day 4: 2017-02-21, same list.\n\n We write the data in a table.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, we are generating a complete forecast.
