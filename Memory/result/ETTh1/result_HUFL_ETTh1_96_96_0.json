  "overall_summary": "The reasoning trajectories demonstrate a systematic approach to time-series forecasting, focusing on handling short historical data (96 hourly points) to predict the next 96 hours. Analysts prioritize identifying seasonality and data patterns, then select methods balancing simplicity and robustness given data constraints. Key steps include data completeness checks, seasonality detection, and method justification, with outputs formatted precisely to match input structures.",

    "Simple Averaging": "50%",
    "SARIMA/ARIMA": "50%"
  },
  "common_data_patterns": [
    "Daily seasonality (24-hour cycles)",
    "Handling of missing values",
    "Downward or stabilizing trends",
    "Hourly pattern consistency (e.g., higher values at night)"
  ],
  "key_insights": [
    "Limited historical records (4 days) restrict complex modeling, favoring simple methods like hourly averaging",
    "Explicit trade-off between model sophistication (e.g., SARIMA) and data sufficiency",
    "Grouping by hour for averaging effectively captures daily seasonality with minimal data",
    "Trend analysis is acknowledged but often deferred due to short time spans",
    "Output formatting rigor: strict adherence to decimal precision and timestamp structures"
  ],
  "complexity_analysis": "Moderately complex with statistical considerations; combines heuristic pattern recognition (e.g., visual hourly trends) with methodical model selection, though constrained by data limitations.",
