        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL, starting from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 to 2016-10-12 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern). We can observe that the load is higher during certain hours (e.g., at night) and lower during the day.\n 2. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days ahead, we can use a simple seasonal model.\n 3. Since the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't see any (all hours are present), we assume the next 96 might have the same pattern.\n 4. We can use a seasonal naive method: using the last available season (i.e., the same hour from the previous day) as the forecast. However, we have 4 days of history, so we can take the average of the same hour across the 4 days to smooth out noise.\n\n Approach:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n   Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   Example:\n     Hour 00:00: average of [2016-10-05 00:00:00, 2016-10-06 00:00:00, 2016-10-07 00:00:00, 2016-10-08 00:00:00]\n     Then for 2016-10-09 00:00:00, 2016-10-10 00:00:00, 2016-10-11 00:00:00, 2016-10-12 00:00:00 we use that same average.\n\n 5. However, note that the pattern might change slightly from day to day. But with only 4 days, we don't have a long history to capture weekly patterns. Therefore, we rely on the daily pattern.\n\n 6. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll group the data by the time of day (ignoring the date) and compute the mean.\n\n 7. The next 96 hours (starting from 2016-10-09 00:00:00) will be:\n\n     2016-10-09 00:00:00 -> average of hour 00:00\n     2016-10-09 01:00:00 -> average of hour 01:00\n     ...\n     2016-10-09 23:00:00 -> average of hour 23:00\n     2016-10-10 00:00:00 -> average of hour 00:00\n     ... and so on.\n\n 8. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour from the timestamp.\n   Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean of MUFL for that hour.\n\n   Given data:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-10-05 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day 2: 2016-10-06 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day 3: 2016-10-07 (index 48 to 71)\n        Day 4: 2016-10-08 (index 72 to 95)\n\n   We can create a list for each hour (0..23) and then compute the average.\n\n 9. Let's calculate the averages = {}\n    for hour in range(24):\n        values = [ data[hour + 0*24], data[hour + 1*24], data[hour + 2*24], data[hour + 3*24] ]\n        average = mean(values)\n\n 10. Then, for the next 96 hours, we assign:\n\n        day0: 2016-10-09 -> hour0: averages[0], hour1: averages[1], ... hour23: averages[23]\n        day1: 2016-10-10 -> same as above\n        day2: 2016-10-11\n        day3: 2016-10-12\n\n 11. We must generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 12. Note: The last timestamp in the given data is 2016-10-08 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2016-10-09 00:00:00.\n\n 13. We'll generate 96 timestamps starting from 2016-10-09 00:00:00 with hourly frequency.\n\n 14. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2016-10-09 00:00:00, [average for hour0]\n        2016-10-09 01:00:00, [average for hour1]\n        ...\n        2016-10-12 23:00:00, [average for hour23]\n\n 15. We must not omit any of the 96 points.\n\n Let's compute the averages:\n\n   We'll write a small code in our mind to compute the average for each hour.\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 2016-10-05 00:00:00 -> 8.742\n        Day2: 2016-10-06 00:00:00 -> 7.640\n        Day3: 2016-10-07 00:00:00 -> 10.980\n        Day4: 2016-10-08 00:00:00 -> 7.498\n        Average = (8.742 + 7.640 + 10.980 + 7.498) / 4 = 8.715\n\n   Similarly, we do for all hours.\n\n 16. We'll compute all 24 averages and then assign them in order for 4 days.\n\n 17. Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any, so we can safely compute the average.\n\n 18. If we had missing values, we would have to impute, but here we don't.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   We'll create a list for the given data:\n\n   data = [ \n        # 2016-10-05\n        8.742, 8.813, 7.782, 8.671, 8.635, 7.533, 8.564, 7.853, 5.934, 5.472, 5.437, 5.934, 4.193, 5.224, 4.904, 4.548, 3.980, 4.477, 3.944, 4.264, 4.015, 3.518, 5.863, 8.599,\n        # 2016-10-06\n        7.640, 8.742, 8.493, 9.168, 7.569, 7.533, 7.214, 8.777, 5.757, 4.513, 5.082, 5.366, 3.909, 5.010, 5.046, 4.087, 4.158, 4.833, 3.838, 4.015, 3.980, 4.051, 6.041, 9.630,\n        # 2016-10-07\n        10.980, 10.625, 10.234, 10.021, 9.701, 7.071, 9.701, 9.417, 8.955, 5.330, 5.686, 5.863, 3.873, 4.158, 4.193, 4.158, 4.193, 4.833, 4.229, 3.802, 3.376, 5.259, 5.330, 7.320,\n        # 2016-10-08\n        7.498, 7.853, 7.285, 7.391, 7.214, 7.818, 7.356, 6.716, 6.610, 5.437, 5.579, 5.721, 3.660, 4.477, 4.087, 4.015, 4.158, 4.513, 4.300, 4.051, 3.553, 5.437, 6.610, 10.661\n    ]\n\n 19. Now, we compute:\n\n        hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72 -> 8.742, 7.640, 10.980, 7.498 -> (8.742+7.640+10.980+7.498)/4 = 8.715\n        hour1: indices 1, 25,49,73 -> 8.813, 8.742, 10.625, 7.853 -> (8.813+8.742+10.625+7.853)/4 = 9.00825\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then, for the next 96 hours, we cycle through these 24 averages 4 times.\n\n 22. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-09 00:00:00\n        End:   2016-10-12 23:00:00\n\n 23. Write the output in the required format.\n\n 24. Since the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content\", we will output 96 lines.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) and then assign for 4 days.\n\n We'll do the calculations:\n\n   hour0: (8.742 + 7.640 + 10.980 + 7.498) / 4 = (8.742+7.640=16.382; 16.382+10.980=27.362; 27.362+7.498=34.86) -> 34.86/4 = 8.715\n   hour1: (8.813 + 8.742 + 10.625 + 7.853) / 4 = (8.813+8.742=17.555; 17.555+10.625=28.18; 28.18+7.853=36.033) -> 36.033/4 = 9.00825 -> 9.008\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   The input data has 3 decimal places, so we'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let's compute all:\n\n   We'll create a list `avg` of length 24.\n\n   hour0: [8.742, 7.640, 10.980, 7.498] -> 8.715\n   hour1: [8.813, 8.742, 10.625, 7.853] -> 9.00825 -> 9.008\n   hour2: [7.782, 8.493, 10.234, 7.285] -> (7.782+8.493=16.275; 16.275+10.234=26.509; 26.509+7.285=33.794) -> 33.794/4=8.4485 -> 8.449\n   hour3: [8.671, 9.168, 10.021, 7.391] -> (8.671+9.168=17.839; 17.839+10.021=27.86; 27.86+7.391=35.251) -> 35.251/4=8.81275 -> 8.813\n   hour4: [8.635, 7.569, 9.701, 7.214] -> (8.635+7.569=16.204; 16.204+9.701=25.905; 25.905+7.214=33.119) -> 33.119/4=8.27975 -> 8.280\n   hour5: [7.533, 7.533, 7.071, 7.818] -> (7.533+7.533=15.066; 15.066+7.071=22.137; 22.137+7.818=29.955) -> 29.955/4=7.48875 -> 7.489\n   hour6: [8.564, 7.214, 9.701, 7.356] -> (8.564+7.214=15.778; 15.778+9.701=25.479; 25.479+7.356=32.835) -> 32.835/4=8.20875 -> 8.209\n   hour7: [7.853, 8.777, 9.417, 6.716] -> (7.853+8.777=16.63; 16.63+9.417=26.047; 26.047+6.716=32.763) -> 32.763/4=8.19075 -> 8.191\n   hour8: [5.934, 5.757, 8.955, 6.610] -> (5.934+5.757=11.691; 11.691+8.955=20.646; 20.646+6.610=27.256) -> 27.256/4=6.814\n   hour9: [5.472, 4.513, 5.330, 5.437] -> (5.472+4.513=9.985; 9.985+5.330=15.315; 15.315+5.437=20.752) -> 20.752/4=5.188\n   hour10: [5.437, 5.082, 5.686, 5.579] -> (5.437+5.082=10.519; 10.519+5.686=16.205; 16.205+5.579=21.784) -> 21.784/4=5.446\n   hour11: [5.934, 5.366, 5.863, 5.721] -> (5.934+5.366=11.3; 11.3+5.863=17.163; 17.163+5.721=22.884) -> 22.884/4=5.721\n   hour12: [4.193, 3.909, 3.873, 3.660] -> (4.193+3.909=8.102; 8.102+3.873=11.975; 11.975+3.660=15.635) -> 15.635/4=3.90875 -> 3.909\n   hour13: [5.224, 5.010, 4.158, 4.477] -> (5.224+5.010=10.234; 10.234+4.158=14.392; 14.392+4.477=18.869) -> 18.869/4=4.71725 -> 4.717\n   hour14: [4.904, 5.046, 4.193, 4.087] -> (4.904+5.046=9.95; 9.95+4.193=14.143; 14.143+4.087=18.23) -> 18.23/4=4.5575 -> 4.558\n   hour15: [4.548, 4.087, 4.158, 4.015] -> (4.548+4.087=8.635; 8.635+4.158=12.793; 12.793+4.015=16.808) -> 16.808/4=4.202\n   hour16: [3.980, 4.158, 4.193, 4.158] -> (3.980+4.158=8.138; 8.138+4.193=12.331; 12.331+4.158=16.489) -> 16.489/4=4.12225 -> 4.122\n   hour17: [4.477, 4.833, 4.833, 4.513] -> (4.477+4.833=9.31; 9.31+4.833=14.143; 14.143+4.513=18.656) -> 18.656/4=4.664\n   hour18: [3.944, 3.838, 4.229, 4.300] -> (3.944+3.838=7.782; 7.782+4.229=12.011; 12.011+4.300=16.311) -> 16.311/4=4.07775 -> 4.078\n   hour19: [4.264, 4.015, 3.802, 4.051] -> (4.264+4.015=8.279; 8.279+3.802=12.081; 12.081+4.051=16.132) -> 16.132/4=4.033\n   hour20: [4.015, 3.980, 3.376, 3.553] -> (4.015+3.980=7.995; 7.995+3.376=11.371; 11.371+3.553=14.924) -> 14.924/4=3.731\n   hour21: [3.518, 4.051, 5.259, 5.437] -> (3.518+4.051=7.569; 7.569+5.259=12.828; 12.828+5.437=18.265) -> 18.265/4=4.56625 -> 4.566\n   hour22: [5.863, 6.041, 5.330, 6.610] -> (5.863+6.041=11.904; 11.904+5.330=17.234; 17.234+6.610=23.844) -> 23.844/4=5.961\n   hour23: [8.599, 9.630, 7.320, 10.661] -> (8.599+9.630=18.229; 18.229+7.320=25.549; 25.549+10.661=36.21) -> 36.21/4=9.0525 -> 9.053\n\n 25.

We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,MUFL\n        2016-10-09 00:00:00,8.715\n        2016-10-09 01:00:00,9.008\n        2016-10-09 02:00:00,8.449\n        2016-10-09 03:00:00,8.813\n        2016-10-09 04:00:00,8.280\n        2016-10-09 05:00:00,7.489\n        2016-10-09 06:00:00,8.209\n        2016-10-09 07:00:00,8.191\n        2016-10-09 08:00:00,6.814\n        2016-10-09 09:00:00,5.188\n        2016-10-09 10:00:00,5.446\n        2016-10-09 11:00:00,5.721\n        2016-10-09 12:00:00,3.909\n        2016-10-09 13:00:00,4.717\n        2016-10-09 14:00:00,4.558\n        2016-10-09 15:00:00,4.202\n        2016-10-09 16:00:00,4.122\n        2016-10-09 17:00:00,4.664\n        2016-10-09 18:00:00,4.078\n        2016-10-09 19:00:00,4.033\n        2016-10-09 20:00:00,3.731\n        2016-10-09 21:00:00,4.566\n        2016-10-09 22:00:00,5.961\n        2016-10-09 23:00:00,9.053\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next day (2016-10-10) and so on.\n\n 35. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 36. We must be cautious: the dates must be consecutive and in order.\n\n 37. We'll generate:\n\n        for day in [9,10,11,12]:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = f\"2016-10-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = averages[hour]\n\n 38. But note: the day 9,10,11,12: 9 is 9, 10, 12? Actually, October has 31 days, so 9,10,11,12 are all valid.\n\n 39. We write the code in our mind to generate the dates and the corresponding average.\n\n 40. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 41. We note: the averages are the same for the same hour in different days.\n\n 42. We write the answer accordingly.\n\n 43. We must not forget the header: \"date,MUFL\"\n\n 44. However, the example input did not have a header? The input started with:\n\n               date   MUFL\n        2016-10-05 00:00:00  8.742\n\n    But in the data, the header was given. We are to output the data in the index and the two columns.\n\n    The example output format in the problem does not show the header? But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n    The input was given with a header. So we output the header as well? \n\n    The problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\" and then shows:\n\n        <answer>\n\n        ...\n\n        </answer>\n\n    and the example input had:\n\n               date   MUFL\n        2016-10-05 00:00:00  8.742\n\n    But in the data block, the header was included. However, the problem's example output does not specify whether to include the header.\n\n    Since the problem says \"complete data\", and the input included a header, we will include the header.\n\n 45. Therefore, the first line: \"date,MUFL\"\n\n 46. Then 96 lines of data.\n\n 47. We write the data without the index.\n\n 48. We are ready.\n\n Let's write the data for the first day (2016-10-09) and then the next three days.\n\n We have the averages list (24 values) as:\n\n   [8.715, 9.008, 8.449, 8.813, 8.280, 7.489, 8.209, 8.191, 6.814, 5.188, 5.446, 5.721, 3.909, 4.717, 4.558, 4.202, 4.122, 4.664, 4.078, 4.033, 3.731, 4.566, 5.961, 9.053]\n\n We'll use this list for each day.\n\n We generate:\n\n   for day in [9,10,11,12]:\n        for hour in range(24):\n            date_str = f\"2016-10-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            value = averages[hour]\n\n 49. We write the value with 3 decimal places.\n\n 50. We output the entire block in the answer.\n\n 51. We must be careful: the day 9,10,11,12: but note that 9 is single digit? We use two digits: 09, 10, 11, 12.\n\n 52. We write:\n\n        date,MUFL\n        2016-10-09 00:00:00,8.715\n        2016-10-09 01:00:00,9.008\n        ... \n\n 53. We do for 4 days.\n\n 54. We output 96 data points.\n\n 55. We are done.\n",
