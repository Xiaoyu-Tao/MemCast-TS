        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days) of Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing entries. So we can proceed with the data as is.\n\n 2. We note that the data is hourly and has a daily seasonality (24 hours) and also weekly patterns might be present, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not captured. Therefore, we can use a time series model that accounts for daily seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the data is short (only 4 days) and we need to forecast 4 days, we can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has a pattern: \n    - The load is lower during the night and early morning (e.g., 3-4) and higher during the day and evening peaks (e.g., 20:00 up to 8.102 on 2017-07-17).\n\n 5. We must be cautious because the data on 2017-07-19 00:00:00 has a spike (8.437) which is an outlier? But we have to consider it.\n\n 6. Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data is small, we can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n\n 7. We choose to use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a model like SARIMA.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Calculate the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? But we only have 4 days, so the trend might not be clear.\n\n 9. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can use the data as is.\n\n 10. We will use a SARIMA model. We have to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24) for the seasonal part.\n\n 11. Steps for SARIMA:\n     - Check stationarity: if not stationary, take differences (d and D).\n     - We note that the data has a daily pattern and also a decreasing trend? Let's see: \n          The first day: starts at 4.508 and ends at 5.391, then next day starts at 4.752 and ends at 5.970, then 4.995 to 5.909, then 8.437 to 5.452. \n          There is no clear long-term trend over 4 days.\n\n 12. We can try to use:\n     - Non-seasonal: d=1 (to remove trend) and then p and q to be determined by ACF/PACF.\n     - Seasonal: D=1 (for the same reason) and period 24, and then P and Q.\n\n 13. However, with only 96 points, we cannot do a very complex model. We can try a simple model: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1,24) or similar.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use an automated approach to select the best parameters by AIC, but with 96 points and 4 days, we are limited.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we can use a simpler model: \n     - We can use the last 4 days and take the average for each hour? But that would ignore any trend and also the spike on the 19th at 00:00.\n\n 16. Another idea: use a moving window of the same hour from the previous days. But we have only 4 days.\n\n 17. We can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality. The `statsmodels` library in Python has an implementation of ExponentialSmoothing that can handle additive or multiplicative seasonality.\n\n 18. Given the data, we see that the amplitude of the daily pattern is relatively constant? So additive seasonality might be appropriate.\n\n 19. We will use:\n     - Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) with additive seasonality and a seasonality period of 24.\n\n 20. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Fit a Holt-Winters model with additive trend and additive seasonality on the 96 points.\n     - Forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 21. However, note that we are not coding but we have to provide the forecast. We can simulate the model in our mind? \n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n     - The forecast for the next day (July 20) is the same as July 19, but that might not capture the pattern.\n\n 23. But the problem requires a complete set of 96 points. We must generate 96 numbers.\n\n 24. Since we are an expert, we can use a standard method and then output the numbers.\n\n 25. However, without actual computation, we have to rely on a pattern. Let's observe:\n\n     The data for each day:\n\n        Day 1 (16th): \n          00:00: 4.508, 01:00: 4.112, ... , 23:00: 5.391\n\n        Day 2 (17th): \n          00:00: 4.752, ... , 23:00: 5.970\n\n        Day 3 (18th): \n          00:00: 4.995, ... , 23:00: 5.909\n\n        Day 4 (19th): \n          00:00: 8.437 (outlier?), 01:00: 5.056, ... , 23:00: 5.452\n\n     The pattern for the same hour across days:\n\n        Hour 0: [4.508, 4.752, 4.995, 8.437] -> average without the outlier? But we cannot arbitrarily remove.\n\n        Instead, we can take the median? Or we can use the last two days? \n\n 26. We note that the data on the 19th at 00:00 is 8.437 which is much higher. It might be an anomaly. But without more context, we have to include it.\n\n 27. We can use a weighted average of the last 4 days for each hour, but with more weight on the most recent day.\n\n 28. However, the problem says we are an expert and we are to forecast. We must provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n 29. We decide to use a simple average of the same hour for the last 4 days. But then the spike on the 19th at 00:00 will affect the forecast for the 20th at 00:00.\n\n 30. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the outlier effect.\n\n 31. Let's calculate the median for each hour:\n\n     For hour 00:00: [4.508, 4.752, 4.995, 8.437] -> sort: [4.508, 4.752, 4.995, 8.437] -> median = (4.752+4.995)/2 = 4.8735\n\n     But note: the spike might be a real event (like a fault or a special condition) and we are to forecast it? Probably not, because it's an outlier.\n\n 32. Since we are forecasting, and we don't have a reason to believe that the spike will repeat, we can use the median to dampen the effect.\n\n 33. Steps for the median method:\n\n     For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the median of the 4 values for that hour.\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we use the same 24 medians repeated for each day.\n\n 34. But note: there might be a trend? The values on the 18th and 19th (except the spike) are slightly higher than the 16th and 17th? \n\n 35. We can adjust by a trend factor. However, with only 4 days, it's hard. We can ignore the trend and use the median.\n\n 36. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: [4.508, 4.752, 4.995, 8.437] -> median = 4.8735\n     Hour 1: [4.112, 4.203, 5.208, 5.056] -> sort: [4.112, 4.203, 5.056, 5.208] -> median = (4.203+5.056)/2 = 4.6295\n     Hour 2: [3.777, 4.173, 4.630, 4.447] -> sort: [3.777, 4.173, 4.447, 4.630] -> median = (4.173+4.447)/2 = 4.310\n     Hour 3: [3.442, 3.868, 4.082, 4.051] -> sort: [3.442, 3.868, 4.051, 4.082] -> median = (3.868+4.051)/2 = 3.9595\n     Hour 4: [3.320, 3.472, 3.716, 3.746] -> sort: [3.320, 3.472, 3.716, 3.746] -> median = (3.472+3.716)/2 = 3.594\n     Hour 5: [3.716, 3.899, 3.990, 3.686] -> sort: [3.686, 3.716, 3.899, 3.990] -> median = (3.716+3.899)/2 = 3.8075\n     Hour 6: [3.868, 4.295, 3.625, 4.112] -> sort: [3.625, 3.868, 4.112, 4.295] -> median = (3.868+4.112)/2 = 3.990\n     Hour 7: [3.746, 3.503, 3.472, 3.533] -> sort: [3.472, 3.503, 3.533, 3.746] -> median = (3.503+3.533)/2 = 3.518\n     Hour 8: [3.838, 3.655, 3.838, 3.960] -> sort: [3.655, 3.838, 3.838, 3.960] -> median = (3.838+3.838)/2 = 3.838\n     Hour 9: [4.021, 4.021, 3.838, 3.929] -> sort: [3.838, 3.929, 4.021, 4.021] -> median = (3.929+4.021)/2 = 3.975\n     Hour 10: [4.508, 4.477, 4.356, 4.447] -> sort: [4.356, 4.447, 4.477, 4.508] -> median = (4.447+4.477)/2 = 4.462\n     Hour 11: [4.447, 5.178, 4.691, 4.721] -> sort: [4.447, 4.691, 4.721, 5.178] -> median = (4.691+4.721)/2 = 4.706\n     Hour 12: [4.325, 5.087, 5.513, 5.026] -> sort: [4.325, 5.026, 5.087, 5.513] -> median = (5.026+5.087)/2 = 5.0565\n     Hour 13: [4.995, 5.879, 5.330, 5.269] -> sort: [4.995, 5.269, 5.330, 5.879] -> median = (5.269+5.330)/2 = 5.2995\n     Hour 14: [5.117, 5.544, 5.087, 5.391] -> sort: [5.087, 5.117, 5.391, 5.544] -> median = (5.117+5.391)/2 = 5.254\n     Hour 15: [4.843, 5.239, 4.782, 4.934] -> sort: [4.782, 4.843, 4.934, 5.239] -> median = (4.843+4.934)/2 = 4.8885\n     Hour 16: [4.691, 4.873, 4.782, 4.660] -> sort: [4.660, 4.691, 4.782, 4.873] -> median = (4.691+4.782)/2 = 4.7365\n     Hour 17: [4.934, 4.965, 4.538, 4.630] -> sort: [4.538, 4.630, 4.934, 4.965] -> median = (4.630+4.934)/2 = 4.782\n     Hour 18: [4.142, 4.873, 4.477, 4.843] -> sort: [4.142, 4.477, 4.843, 4.873] -> median = (4.477+4.843)/2 = 4.660\n     Hour 19: [4.691, 5.148, 5.208, 4.965] -> sort: [4.691, 4.965, 5.148, 5.208] -> median = (4.965+5.148)/2 = 5.0565\n     Hour 20: [7.006, 8.102, 7.828, 6.945] -> sort: [6.945, 7.006, 7.828, 8.102] -> median = (7.006+7.828)/2 = 7.417\n     Hour 21: [6.305, 7.798, 7.280, 7.493] -> sort: [6.305, 7.280, 7.493, 7.798] -> median = (7.280+7.493)/2 = 7.3865\n     Hour 22: [6.061, 7.371, 6.366, 6.153] -> sort: [6.061, 6.153, 6.366, 7.371] -> median = (6.153+6.366)/2 = 6.2595\n     Hour 23: [5.391, 5.970, 5.909, 5.452] -> sort: [5.391, 5.452, 5.909, 5.970] -> median = (5.452+5.909)/2 = 5.6805\n\n 37. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (20th): [4.8735, 4.6295, 4.310, 3.9595, 3.594, 3.8075, 3.990, 3.518, 3.838, 3.975, 4.462, 4.706, 5.0565, 5.2995, 5.254, 4.8885, 4.7365, 4.782, 4.660, 5.0565, 7.417, 7.3865, 6.2595, 5.6805]\n        Day 2 (21st): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (22nd): same\n        Day 4 (23rd): same\n\n 38. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. And we are to forecast the next 96 points without missing.\n\n 39. We output 96 lines of data.\n\n 40. Format: \n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-07-20 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-07-20 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-07-23 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n 41. We must be cautious: the median values we calculated are for each hour. We have 24 medians and we repeat them 4 times.\n\n 42. However, we note that the median for hour 0 is 4.8735, but we have to round? The original data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimals.\n\n 43. Let's round the medians to 3 decimal places:\n\n        Hour0: 4.874\n        Hour1: 4.630\n        Hour2: 4.310\n        Hour3: 3.960\n        Hour4: 3.594\n        Hour5: 3.808\n        Hour6: 3.990\n        Hour7: 3.518\n        Hour8: 3.838\n        Hour9: 3.975\n        Hour10: 4.462\n        Hour11: 4.706\n        Hour12: 5.057\n        Hour13: 5.300\n        Hour14: 5.254\n        Hour15: 4.889\n        Hour16: 4.737\n        Hour17: 4.782\n        Hour18: 4.660\n        Hour19: 5.057\n        Hour20: 7.417\n        Hour21: 7.387\n        Hour22: 6.260\n        Hour23: 5.681\n\n 44. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-20 00:00:00 -> 4.874\n                01:00:00 -> 4.630\n                ... until 23:00:00 -> 5.681\n\n        Then 2017-07-21 00:00:00 -> 4.874 (same as 20th 00:00:00)\n        ... and so on.\n\n 45. We generate the dates:\n\n        from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00\n\n 46. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 47. This method is simple and robust to the outlier on the 19th at 00:00.\n\n 48. However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we might use a more sophisticated method. But with the limited data, this is acceptable.\n\n 49. We output the data.\n\n 50. We note: if we had more data, we would use a model that captures trend and seasonality, but with 4 days, the median per hour is a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's write the data.\n",
