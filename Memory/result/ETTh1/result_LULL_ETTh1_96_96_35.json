        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a time series with an hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for 96 points is complete.\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 future points and the data shows some daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a seasonal time series model.\n\n However, note that the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). With such a short history, complex models might not be feasible.\n\n We can consider:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the value from the same hour in the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hour over the available days? \n   - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters with daily seasonality) but with 4 days we have only one full cycle of 24*4=96, so we can set seasonality to 24.\n\n But note: the data does not have a clear trend and the seasonality might be daily (24 points). However, the data is very short (only 4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n   - Calculate the average of each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the data:\n   - Group by hour of the day (i.e., 0,1,...,23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n Then, for the next 96 hours (which is 4 days), we repeat the hourly pattern we computed.\n\n But note: the data from 2016-11-18 to 2016-11-21 (4 days) might have a different pattern? We can also consider a moving window or exponential smoothing per hour.\n\n However, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can directly compute the hourly average.\n\n Let's compute the hourly average:\n\n   Hour 0: (0.305 + 1.279 + 0.670 + 1.127) / 4 = (0.381) [But let me calculate: 0.305+1.279=1.584; 1.584+0.670=2.254; 2.254+1.127=3.381 -> 3.381/4 = 0.84525]\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for the same hour might vary. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n However, we are to forecast 4 days. So we can use the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n But wait: what if there is a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data to capture weekly (only 4 days, which are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday?).\n\n Let me check the dates:\n   2016-11-18: Friday\n   2016-11-19: Saturday\n   2016-11-20: Sunday\n   2016-11-21: Monday\n\n So the next 4 days would be:\n   2016-11-22: Tuesday\n   2016-11-23: Wednesday\n   2016-11-24: Thursday\n   2016-11-25: Friday\n\n We don't have data for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So we cannot use a weekly pattern because we don't have the same day of the week in the history.\n\n Therefore, the safest is to use the average of the available days for each hour.\n\n Steps:\n   - Create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and collect the values for that hour from the 4 days.\n   - Compute the mean for each hour.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will output:\n   Day1 (Tuesday): the 24 hourly means in order (hour0, hour1, ... hour23)\n   Day2 (Wednesday): same 24 hourly means\n   Day3 (Thursday): same\n   Day4 (Friday): same\n\n But note: the pattern might change by day of week? We don't have data to support that. So we use the overall average.\n\n However, we can also consider a simple model that uses the last available day (Monday) and then adjust by the average hourly pattern? \n But without more data, the average per hour is a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour0: [0.305, 1.279, 0.670, 1.127] -> mean = (0.305+1.279+0.670+1.127)/4 = 3.381/4 = 0.84525\n   hour1: [0.487, 1.097, 0.609, 1.066] -> (0.487+1.097+0.609+1.066)=3.259/4=0.81475\n   hour2: [0.335, 1.036, 0.518, 1.097] -> (0.335+1.036+0.518+1.097)=2.986/4=0.7465\n   hour3: [0.396, 1.005, 0.640, 1.188] -> (0.396+1.005+0.640+1.188)=3.229/4=0.80725\n   hour4: [0.305, 1.127, 0.518, 0.579] -> (0.305+1.127+0.518+0.579)=2.529/4=0.63225\n   hour5: [0.487, 1.036, 0.609, 0.548] -> (0.487+1.036+0.609+0.548)=2.68/4=0.67\n   hour6: [0.609, 1.066, 0.487, 0.548] -> (0.609+1.066+0.487+0.548)=2.71/4=0.6775\n   hour7: [0.731, 1.127, 0.579, 0.731] -> (0.731+1.127+0.579+0.731)=3.168/4=0.792\n   hour8: [0.761, 1.066, 0.792, 1.097] -> (0.761+1.066+0.792+1.097)=3.716/4=0.929\n   hour9: [0.883, 1.279, 0.883, 0.975] -> (0.883+1.279+0.883+0.975)=4.02/4=1.005\n   hour10: [0.975, 1.249, 0.944, 0.670] -> (0.975+1.249+0.944+0.670)=3.838/4=0.9595\n   hour11: [1.036, 0.853, 1.127, 0.731] -> (1.036+0.853+1.127+0.731)=3.747/4=0.93675\n   hour12: [0.822, 1.036, 0.761, 0.579] -> (0.822+1.036+0.761+0.579)=3.198/4=0.7995\n   hour13: [0.944, 1.036, 1.066, 0.853] -> (0.944+1.036+1.066+0.853)=3.899/4=0.97475\n   hour14: [0.822, 1.005, 0.883, 0.853] -> (0.822+1.005+0.883+0.853)=3.563/4=0.89075\n   hour15: [0.914, 1.127, 0.944, 0.701] -> (0.914+1.127+0.944+0.701)=3.686/4=0.9215\n   hour16: [0.670, 0.975, 0.792, 0.822] -> (0.670+0.975+0.792+0.822)=3.259/4=0.81475\n   hour17: [0.853, 0.883, 0.822, 0.914] -> (0.853+0.883+0.822+0.914)=3.472/4=0.868\n   hour18: [0.761, 0.670, 0.822, 0.670] -> (0.761+0.670+0.822+0.670)=2.923/4=0.73075\n   hour19: [0.609, 0.548, 0.670, 0.518] -> (0.609+0.548+0.670+0.518)=2.345/4=0.58625\n   hour20: [0.640, 0.548, 0.670, 0.487] -> (0.640+0.548+0.670+0.487)=2.345/4=0.58625\n   hour21: [0.548, 0.640, 0.579, 0.548] -> (0.548+0.640+0.579+0.548)=2.315/4=0.57875\n   hour22: [0.487, 0.609, 0.579, 0.457] -> (0.487+0.609+0.579+0.457)=2.132/4=0.533\n   hour23: [0.548, 0.579, 0.579, 0.426] -> (0.548+0.579+0.579+0.426)=2.132/4=0.533\n\n So the hourly pattern (rounded to 3 decimal places as in the input) is:\n\n   hour0: 0.845\n   hour1: 0.815\n   hour2: 0.747\n   hour3: 0.807\n   hour4: 0.632\n   hour5: 0.670\n   hour6: 0.678\n   hour7: 0.792\n   hour8: 0.929\n   hour9: 1.005\n   hour10: 0.960\n   hour11: 0.937\n   hour12: 0.800\n   hour13: 0.975\n   hour14: 0.891\n   hour15: 0.922\n   hour16: 0.815\n   hour17: 0.868\n   hour18: 0.731\n   hour19: 0.586\n   hour20: 0.586\n   hour21: 0.579\n   hour22: 0.533\n   hour23: 0.533\n\n Now, we will generate 4 days of data (from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00) by repeating this pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the first day of the forecast is 2016-11-22 (Tuesday) and we start at hour0.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   2016-11-22 00:00:00: 0.845\n   2016-11-22 01:00:00: 0.815\n   ... until 2016-11-22 23:00:00: 0.533\n\n   then 2016-11-23 00:00:00: 0.845\n   ... and so on.\n\n However, note that the input data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n But wait: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. We are not given any in the next 96, so we just output the forecast.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-22 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n We can use pandas to generate the date range? But we are to output in the same format.\n\n Alternatively, we can write a loop.\n\n We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 entries.\n\n We'll create a list of dates:\n\n   from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n   start_date = datetime(2016, 11, 22, 0, 0, 0)\n   then add 0 to 95 hours.\n\n But note: the input data ends at 2016-11-21 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-11-22 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   dates = [start_date + timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n And the values: \n   values = [ pattern[i % 24] for i in range(96) ]\n\n But we computed the pattern for hour0 to hour23. So for the first hour (index0) we use pattern[0], then pattern[1] for index1, ... pattern[23] for index23, then pattern[0] for index24, etc.\n\n However, note: the pattern we computed is for the same hour of the day. So:\n\n   index0: 2016-11-22 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> pattern[0] = 0.845\n   index1: 2016-11-22 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> pattern[1] = 0.815\n   ...\n   index23: 2016-11-22 23:00:00 -> hour23 -> pattern[23] = 0.533\n   index24: 2016-11-23 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> pattern[0] = 0.845\n\n This is correct.\n\n But note: the input data has a value for 2016-11-21 23:00:00 of 0.426, and then we are starting the forecast at 0.845 for 2016-11-22 00:00:00. \n This jump is because we are using the average of the four days. This is acceptable.\n\n We'll output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'\n\n However, the problem says \"complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", so we must output 96 rows.\n\n Let's code the output:\n\n   <answer>\n        date                 LULL\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 0.845\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 0.815\n        ... \n        2016-11-25 23:00:00 0.533\n\n But note: we must round to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the computed averages have more. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the input data has 3 decimal places, but the averages might be more precise. We'll round to 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the exact computed value and then format to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the precision, but the input has 3. So we output 3.\n\n But note: the computed average for hour0 is 0.84525 -> rounded to 3 decimals is 0.845.\n\n We'll do that for all.\n\n However, let me recalc to be safe:\n\n   We'll create a list of the pattern with 24 values, each rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n   pattern = [\n        0.845,  # 0.84525 -> 0.845\n        0.815,  # 0.81475 -> 0.815\n        0.747,  # 0.7465 -> 0.747\n        0.807,  # 0.80725 -> 0.807\n        0.632,  # 0.63225 -> 0.632\n        0.670,  # 0.67 -> 0.670\n        0.678,  # 0.6775 -> 0.678\n        0.792,  # 0.792 -> 0.792\n        0.929,  # 0.929 -> 0.929\n        1.005,  # 1.005 -> 1.005\n        0.960,  # 0.9595 -> 0.960\n        0.937,  # 0.93675 -> 0.937\n        0.800,  # 0.7995 -> 0.800\n        0.975,  # 0.97475 -> 0.975\n        0.891,  # 0.89075 -> 0.891\n        0.922,  # 0.9215 -> 0.922\n        0.815,  # 0.81475 -> 0.815\n        0.868,  # 0.868 -> 0.868\n        0.731,  # 0.73075 -> 0.731\n        0.586,  # 0.58625 -> 0.586\n        0.586,  # 0.58625 -> 0.586\n        0.579,  # 0.57875 -> 0.579\n        0.533,  # 0.533 -> 0.533\n        0.533   # 0.533 -> 0.533\n   ]\n\n But wait: hour10: 0.9595 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 0.960? \n        hour12: 0.7995 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 0.800\n\n However, note that the input data does not have any value with more than 3 decimal places, so we output 3.\n\n But the rounding: \n   0.7995 -> 0.800 (if we round half up) -> yes.\n\n We'll use standard rounding.\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n   Then: 2016-11-22 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n However, note: the input data had the index as the date string?\n   We are to output without the index? Just two columns.\n\n Format:\n\n        date  LULL\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 0.845\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 0.815\n        ...\n\n We'll output 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n   base = datetime(2016, 11, 22, 0, 0, 0)\n   for i in range(96):\n        date = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n        value = pattern[i % 24]\n\n But note: the pattern index: \n        i=0 -> pattern[0] -> hour0\n        i=1 -> pattern[1] -> hour1\n        ... \n        i=23 -> pattern[23] -> hour23\n        i=24 -> pattern[0] -> hour0\n\n This is correct.\n\n We'll output the date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n Example: '2016-11-22 00:00:00'\n\n We'll write the data as:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 0.845\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 0.815\n        ... \n\n But note: the problem says \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and we are to output in the same format as the input? The input had:\n\n               date  LULL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.305\n\n So we output without the index and without the header? The problem says \"complete data\", meaning the two columns.\n\n However, the example output format in the problem did not include the header? It just had the date and the value.\n\n But the problem's example input data had:\n\n        date  LULL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.305\n\n But then the next lines were without the header? Actually, the problem provided:\n\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.305\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00 0.487\n\n So we output without the header.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n And the example input had the header? Actually, the problem wrote:\n\n               date  LULL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.305\n\n But then the rest without the header? It's a bit ambiguous.\n\n However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\"\n\n And the example input they provided did not have the header in the data lines? They had the header once and then the data.\n\n But we are to output only the data? Without the header? \n\n Since the problem says \"complete data\", and the example input they gave had the header at the top, but then the data without header? \n\n Actually, the example input they provided was:\n\n               date  LULL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 0.305\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00 0.487\n        ...\n\n So we are to output without the header? Because the header was only at the top? \n\n But we are not the input, we are the output. The problem says \"give me the complete data\", meaning the 96 rows of data? \n\n And the example output format in the problem's instruction did not include the header? It just had the data.\n\n So we output 96 lines, each line: \n        [date string] [value]\n\n with the value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll output 96 lines of data.\n\n Let's generate:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-22 00:00:00\n   End: 2016-11-25 23:00:00\n\n We'll use:\n\n   pattern = [\n        0.845, 0.815, 0.747, 0.807, 0.632, 0.670, \n        0.678, 0.792, 0.929, 1.005, 0.960, 0.937, \n        0.800, 0.975, 0.891, 0.922, 0.815, 0.868, \n        0.731, 0.586, 0.586, 0.579, 0.533, 0.533\n   ]\n\n   Then for i in 0 to 95:\n        date = (2016-11-22 00:00:00) + i hours\n        value = pattern[i % 24]\n\n We'll write the date in the format: \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n\n Example: \n        i=0: \"2016-11-22 00:00:00\" 0.845\n        i=1: \"2016-11-22 01:00:00\" 0.815\n        ...\n        i=23: \"2016-11-22 23:00:00\" 0.533\n        i=24: \"2016-11-23 00:00:00\" 0.845\n\n Let's do the first few:\n\n   i=0: 2016-11-22 00:00:00 0.845\n   i=1: 2016-11-22 01:00:00 0.815\n   i=2: 2016-11-22 02:00:00 0.747\n   i=3: 2016-11-22 03:00:00 0.807\n   i=4: 2016-11-22 04:00:00 0.632\n   i=5: 2016-11-22 05:00:00 0.670\n   i=6: 2016-11-22 06:00:00 0.678\n   i=7: 2016-11-22 07:00:00 0.792\n   i=8: 2016-11-22 08:00:00 0.929\n   i=9: 2016-11-22 09:00:00 1.005\n   i=10: 2016-11-22 10:00:00 0.960\n   i=11: 2016-11-22 11:00:00 0.937\n   i=12: 2016-11-22 12:00:00 0.800\n   i=13: 2016-11-22 13:00:00 0.975\n   i=14: 2016-11-22 14:00:00 0.891\n   i=15: 2016-11-22 15:00:00 0.922\n   i=16: 2016-11-22 16:00:00 0.815\n   i=17: 2016-11-22 17:00:00 0.868\n   i=18: 2016-11-22 18:00:00 0.731\n   i=19: 2016-11-22 19:00:00 0.586\n   i=20: 2016-11-22 20:00:00 0.586\n   i=21: 2016-11-22 21:00:00 0.579\n   i=22: 2016-11-22 22:00:00 0.533\n   i=23: 2016-11-22 23:00:00 0.533\n   i=24: 2016-11-23 00:00:00 0.845\n\n And so on.\n\n We'll write 96 lines.\n\n Let's code the generation in the answer.\n\n Note: We are to output in the <answer> block as:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016-11-22 00:00:00 0.845\n        2016-11-22 01:00:00 0.815\n        ...\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", meaning we must not skip any hour.\n\n We are generating 96 consecutive hours.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
