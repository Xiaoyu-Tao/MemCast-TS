        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The data spans from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not show any explicit missing rows (we have 96 consecutive hourly entries). However, we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2. We must be cautious: the data might have internal missing values? But in the provided data, the timestamps are consecutive.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we are forecasting the next 4 days (from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00).\n\n 4. We are to use a time series forecasting method that can handle potential missing values. However, the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. But the user says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be prepared. Since we are only given 96 points without gaps, we can proceed to model.\n\n 5. We note that the data exhibits:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - The values are continuous and show a pattern: \n        * Higher values during the night (e.g., around 00:00 to early morning) and \n        * Lower values during the day (especially in the morning and afternoon) with some negative values.\n\n 6. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n 7. However, note that the data has some negative values, so we cannot use multiplicative seasonality that requires positive data. We can use additive seasonality.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast, we choose to use a simple and robust method: \n    - We will use the Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by LOESS (STL) to decompose the series and then forecast the seasonally adjusted part with ARIMA and then re-seasonalize.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the `SARIMAX` model from statsmodels.\n\n 10. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Check for missing values in the provided data and impute if necessary (but the provided data is complete).\n     - Fit a SARIMA model with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24). We need to select the parameters.\n\n 11. However, since we are not running code, we must rely on typical patterns and the given data.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we are to generate the next 96 points. We can use a naive approach: \n     - The data shows a daily pattern. We can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust for any trend.\n\n 13. But note: the data does not show a clear upward or downward trend over the 4 days. We see:\n      Day1: 2017-09-06: min ~ -1.883, max ~9.417\n      Day2: 2017-09-07: min ~ -11.478, max ~9.559\n      Day3: 2017-09-08: min ~ -10.625, max ~8.351\n      Day4: 2017-09-09: min ~ -14.427, max ~10.589\n\n 14. The pattern is volatile. We might need to capture the seasonality and the level of the last day.\n\n 15. We can use a method: \n      - For each hour (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we compute the average of that hour over the past 4 days and then adjust by the difference between the last day's average and the overall average? \n\n 16. However, a more robust way is to use the last day's seasonality and then adjust by the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the following:\n      - We note that the data might be affected by weekly patterns? But we only have 4 days (Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). The next 4 days would be Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed.\n\n 18. Without more data, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. So we stick to daily.\n\n 19. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days as the forecast for that hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 20. But note: the data on 2017-09-09 (Saturday) might be different from the next Sunday? We don't have data for Sunday to compare.\n\n 21. Since we don't have information about weekly seasonality, we assume the daily pattern is consistent.\n\n 22. Steps for forecasting:\n      - For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, we have 4 observations: h, h+24, h+48, h+72.\n      - We compute the average for hour h: avg_h = (x_h + x_{h+24} + x_{h+48} + x_{h+72}) / 4.\n\n      - Then for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) at hour h, we set:\n          day5_h = avg_h\n          day6_h = avg_h\n          day7_h = avg_h\n          day8_h = avg_h\n\n 23. However, this ignores any trend and the possibility of a different level. We can adjust by the last day's overall level? \n\n 24. Another idea: use the last day (2017-09-09) as the base and then add the average seasonal deviation from the mean? \n\n 25. We can do:\n      - Calculate the overall mean of the 96 points: total_mean.\n      - For each hour h, calculate the average seasonal component: s_h = avg_h - total_mean.\n      - Then for the next days, we can set the forecast for hour h as: \n            forecast = total_mean + s_h\n\n 26. But this would give the same value for the same hour every day. We are ignoring the possibility of a trend.\n\n 27. Given the short time and no clear trend, we can use the above.\n\n 28. However, the data shows that the level of the daily average is changing:\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day2: average = ... \n        We see the daily averages:\n          Day1: 2017-09-06: average = (9.417+8.742+...+8.528)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n                positive and negative: we can see the day starts high, then drops and then rises at night. \n                Without exact, we note that the daily average might be around 5? (by quick scan)\n\n 29. Instead, we can use a moving average of the last few days to set the level? \n\n 30. We decide to use the average of the last day (2017-09-09) as the base level for the next day? \n\n 31. Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire 96 points as the base level and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 32. Let's calculate the total mean of the 96 points:\n        Sum = 9.417+8.742+7.782+...+6.929 (96 numbers)\n        We can approximate: \n            The numbers range from -14.427 to 10.589. \n            We can compute by grouping:\n\n        But we don't have the exact sum. We can assume the total mean is about 1.0? (This is a guess, but we must be precise)\n\n 33. Since we are to provide exact numbers, we must compute the total mean.\n\n 34. But note: the user provided the data and we are to forecast without running code? \n\n 35. We are in a dilemma. We must provide the forecast.\n\n 36. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days without any level adjustment. \n\n 37. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (9.417 + 9.559 + 7.747 + 10.589) / 4 = (9.417+9.559=19.0, +7.747=26.747, +10.589=37.336) -> 9.334\n        hour1: (8.742 + 7.569 + 7.995 + 8.848) / 4 = (8.742+7.569=16.311, +7.995=24.306, +8.848=33.154) -> 8.2885\n        ... and so on.\n\n 38. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00) will be:\n        Day1 (2017-09-10): [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... hour23_avg]\n        Day2 (2017-09-11): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-09-12): same\n        Day4 (2017-09-13): same\n\n 39. But note: the user said the data will have missing values. We are not given missing values in the input, but we are to be aware. \n     Since we are not given missing values, we proceed.\n\n 40. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", meaning in the provided 96? But we don't see any. \n     We assume the provided 96 are complete.\n\n 41. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We generate 96 timestamps from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00.\n\n 42. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        We'll calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) by:\n            hour00: (value at 2017-09-06 00:00:00 + 2017-09-07 00:00:00 + 2017-09-08 00:00:00 + 2017-09-09 00:00:00) / 4\n            hour01: (value at 2017-09-06 01:00:00 + ...) / 4\n            ... until hour23.\n\n 43. Then we repeat the same 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 44. We do the calculation:\n\n        hour00: (9.417 + 9.559 + 7.747 + 10.589) / 4 = 37.312 / 4 = 9.328\n        hour01: (8.742 + 7.569 + 7.995 + 8.848) / 4 = 33.154 / 4 = 8.2885\n        hour02: (7.782 + 8.209 + 4.797 + 9.275) / 4 = 30.063 / 4 = 7.51575\n        hour03: (8.777 + 8.955 + 6.183 + 9.559) / 4 = 33.474 / 4 = 8.3685\n        hour04: (8.671 + 9.097 + 5.757 + 10.021) / 4 = 33.546 / 4 = 8.3865\n        hour05: (8.671 + 8.315 + 5.863 + 8.955) / 4 = 31.804 / 4 = 7.951\n        hour06: (8.955 + 7.711 + 7.569 + 9.559) / 4 = 33.794 / 4 = 8.4485\n        hour07: (7.889 + 6.219 + 5.010 + 6.005) / 4 = 25.123 / 4 = 6.28075\n        hour08: (4.264 + 4.691 + 3.802 -0.355) / 4 = 12.402 / 4 = 3.1005\n        hour09: (-1.883 + 4.442 -2.843 -3.696) / 4 = (-3.98) / 4 = -0.995\n        hour10: (0.284 + 0.249 -7.818 -9.132) / 4 = (-16.417) / 4 = -4.10425\n        hour11: (0.391 -6.076 -11.265 -6.823) / 4 = (-23.773) / 4 = -5.94325\n        hour12: (1.848 -4.904 -9.879 -9.061) / 4 = (-21.996) / 4 = -5.499\n        hour13: (2.878 -11.478 -10.305 -14.427) / 4 = (-33.332) / 4 = -8.333\n        hour14: (2.168 -4.193 -10.412 -11.940) / 4 = (-24.377) / 4 = -6.09425\n        hour15: (2.381 -3.305 -10.625 -6.894) / 4 = (-18.443) / 4 = -4.61075\n        hour16: (3.020 -6.148 -2.168 -5.259) / 4 = (-10.555) / 4 = -2.63875\n        hour17: (3.838 + 0.604 + 0.426 + 1.777) / 4 = 6.645 / 4 = 1.66125\n        hour18: (4.122 + 3.625 + 3.767 + 4.371) / 4 = 15.885 / 4 = 3.97125\n        hour19: (4.620 + 4.726 + 4.868 + 5.117) / 4 = 19.331 / 4 = 4.83275\n        hour20: (4.620 + 4.868 + 5.046 + 5.366) / 4 = 19.9 / 4 = 4.975\n        hour21: (6.005 + 4.513 + 6.752 + 4.584) / 4 = 21.854 / 4 = 5.4635\n        hour22: (6.787 + 3.767 + 7.889 + 5.579) / 4 = 24.022 / 4 = 6.0055\n        hour23: (8.528 + 6.858 + 8.351 + 6.929) / 4 = 30.666 / 4 = 7.6665\n\n 45. Now, we have 24 values. We will repeat these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 46. The next 96 timestamps (from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00) are:\n\n        2017-09-10 00:00:00 -> 9.328\n        2017-09-10 01:00:00 -> 8.2885\n        ... until 2017-09-10 23:00:00 -> 7.6665\n\n        then 2017-09-11 00:00:00 -> 9.328\n        ... and so on.\n\n 47. We must format the answer exactly as the input: two columns, with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and the MUFL value with 3 decimal places? \n     The input had 3 decimal places. We computed with more, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. Rounding:\n\n        hour00: 9.328 -> 9.328\n        hour01: 8.2885 -> 8.289 (rounded to 3 decimals: 8.289)\n        hour02: 7.51575 -> 7.516\n        hour03: 8.3685 -> 8.369\n        hour04: 8.3865 -> 8.387\n        hour05: 7.951 -> 7.951\n        hour06: 8.4485 -> 8.449\n        hour07: 6.28075 -> 6.281\n        hour08: 3.1005 -> 3.101\n        hour09: -0.995 -> -0.995\n        hour10: -4.10425 -> -4.104\n        hour11: -5.94325 -> -5.943\n        hour12: -5.499 -> -5.499\n        hour13: -8.333 -> -8.333\n        hour14: -6.09425 -> -6.094\n        hour15: -4.61075 -> -4.611\n        hour16: -2.63875 -> -2.639\n        hour17: 1.66125 -> 1.661\n        hour18: 3.97125 -> 3.971\n        hour19: 4.83275 -> 4.833\n        hour20: 4.975 -> 4.975\n        hour21: 5.4635 -> 5.464\n        hour22: 6.0055 -> 6.006\n        hour23: 7.6665 -> 7.667\n\n 49. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-10 00:00:00 -> 9.328\n        Then 2017-09-10 01:00:00 -> 8.289\n        ... and so on.\n\n 50. We generate 4 days of 24 hours each.\n\n 51. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 52. Note: We are to provide the complete data without omitting any.\n\n 53. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-09-10 00:00:00   9.328\n2017-09-10 01:00:00   8.289\n2017-09-10 02:00:00   7.516\n2017-09-10 03:00:00   8.369\n2017-09-10 04:00:00   8.387\n2017-09-10 05:00:00   7.951\n2017-09-10 06:00:00   8.449\n2017-09-10 07:00:00   6.281\n2017-09-10 08:00:00   3.101\n2017-09-10 09:00:00  -0.995\n2017-09-10 10:00:00  -4.104\n2017-09-10 11:00:00  -5.943\n2017-09-10 12:00:00  -5.499\n2017-09-10 13:00:00  -8.333\n2017-09-10 14:00:00  -6.094\n2017-09-10 15:00:00  -4.611\n2017-09-10 16:00:00  -2.639\n2017-09-10 17:00:00   1.661\n2017-09-10 18:00:00   3.971\n2017-09-10 19:00:00   4.833\n2017-09-10 20:00:00   4.975\n2017-09-10 21:00:00   5.464\n2017-09-10 22:00:00   6.006\n2017-09-10 23:00:00   7.667\n2017-09-11 00:00:00   9.328\n2017-09-11 01:00:00   8.289\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 54. We note that the last day (2017-09-13) will end at 23:00:00 with 7.667.\n\n 55. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 56. Since the pattern repeats exactly for 4 days, we can write the 24 values for the first day and then copy 4 times? But we must write all 96.\n\n 57.
