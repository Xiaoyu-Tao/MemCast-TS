        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-02 00:00:00 to 2017-06-05 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to predict 96 steps ahead (next 96 hours).\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 96 consecutive hours).\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are dealing with hourly data and only 96 points, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days (so weekly pattern is not evident).\n    - Given the short history, we can use a model that can capture daily seasonality. The seasonality period is 24.\n\n 4. We can use models like:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality\n    - Or a simple approach: using the average of the same hour in the past days (if we have multiple days) but we have only 4 days.\n\n 5. However, note that the data shows some variation and we have a step change? (e.g., on 2017-06-03 00:00:00 it jumps to 1.858). \n    We must be cautious.\n\n 6. Given the constraints (only 96 points and forecasting 96 points) and the requirement to provide the complete data without omission, \n    we must generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n 7. We'll use a simple method: \n    - Decompose the time series to capture the daily pattern and then project forward.\n    - Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-06-05) and adjust it by the average daily pattern? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of each hour across the 4 days to form a daily profile, then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for the average method:\n      - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this daily profile 4 times.\n\n 9. But note: the data does not show a clear stable pattern? Let's check:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-06-02): \n        00: 0.914, 01:0.792, ... 23:1.188\n    Day 2 (2017-06-03): \n        00:1.858, 01:1.462, ... 23:1.097\n    Day 3 (2017-06-04): \n        00:1.157, 01:0.822, ... 23:0.944\n    Day 4 (2017-06-05): \n        00:0.944, 01:0.822, ... 23:0.853\n\n    The values at the same hour vary. We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n    hour0: (0.914 + 1.858 + 1.157 + 0.944) / 4 = (0.914+1.858=2.772; 2.772+1.157=3.929; 3.929+0.944=4.873) -> 4.873/4 = 1.21825\n    hour1: (0.792+1.462+0.822+0.822)/4 = (0.792+1.462=2.254; 2.254+0.822=3.076; 3.076+0.822=3.898) -> 3.898/4 = 0.9745\n\n    We can do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 10. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00) would be the daily profile repeated 4 times.\n\n 11. However, note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We can also consider using the last day's pattern and adjust by the average daily change? \n     But the average method is simple and might be acceptable.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the level and then apply the seasonal index.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide the complete data, we choose the average method.\n\n 14. Steps:\n      - Extract the hour from the timestamp for each record.\n      - Group by hour and compute the mean of the 4 days for that hour.\n      - Create the next 96 hours (starting from 2017-06-06 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-09 23:00:00) and assign the corresponding hourly average.\n\n 15. But note: the last provided data point is at 2017-06-05 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n      Start: 2017-06-06 00:00:00\n      End: 2017-06-09 23:00:00\n\n 16. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 17. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      hour0: (0.914, 1.858, 1.157, 0.944) -> mean = (0.914+1.858+1.157+0.944)/4 = 4.873/4 = 1.21825\n      hour1: (0.792, 1.462, 0.822, 0.822) -> (0.792+1.462+0.822+0.822)=3.898 -> 0.9745\n      hour2: (0.883, 1.584, 0.975, 0.944) -> (0.883+1.584+0.975+0.944)=4.386 -> 1.0965\n      hour3: (0.883, 1.492, 0.975, 0.914) -> (0.883+1.492+0.975+0.914)=4.264 -> 1.066\n      hour4: (0.883, 1.645, 1.249, 1.036) -> (0.883+1.645+1.249+1.036)=4.813 -> 1.20325\n      hour5: (1.005, 0.975, 1.005, 1.127) -> (1.005+0.975+1.005+1.127)=4.112 -> 1.028\n      hour6: (1.127, 1.097, 1.492, 1.036) -> (1.127+1.097+1.492+1.036)=4.752 -> 1.188\n      hour7: (1.066, 1.218, 1.218, 1.036) -> (1.066+1.218+1.218+1.036)=4.538 -> 1.1345\n      hour8: (1.097, 1.157, 1.218, 1.401) -> (1.097+1.157+1.218+1.401)=4.873 -> 1.21825\n      hour9: (1.066, 1.401, 1.310, 0.670) -> (1.066+1.401+1.310+0.670)=4.447 -> 1.11175\n      hour10: (1.157, 1.279, 1.310, 0.670) -> (1.157+1.279+1.310+0.670)=4.416 -> 1.104\n      hour11: (1.157, 1.036, 1.157, 0.731) -> (1.157+1.036+1.157+0.731)=4.081 -> 1.02025\n      hour12: (1.036, 0.944, 1.218, 0.975) -> (1.036+0.944+1.218+0.975)=4.173 -> 1.04325\n      hour13: (0.853, 1.097, 1.097, 0.640) -> (0.853+1.097+1.097+0.640)=3.687 -> 0.92175\n      hour14: (1.066, 1.218, 1.066, 0.761) -> (1.066+1.218+1.066+0.761)=4.111 -> 1.02775\n      hour15: (1.249, 1.188, 1.066, 0.822) -> (1.249+1.188+1.066+0.822)=4.325 -> 1.08125\n      hour16: (1.188, 1.310, 1.188, 0.761) -> (1.188+1.310+1.188+0.761)=4.447 -> 1.11175\n      hour17: (1.188, 1.188, 1.005, 0.853) -> (1.188+1.188+1.005+0.853)=4.234 -> 1.0585\n      hour18: (1.036, 0.944, 0.944, 0.822) -> (1.036+0.944+0.944+0.822)=3.746 -> 0.9365\n      hour19: (1.157, 0.975, 0.853, 0.761) -> (1.157+0.975+0.853+0.761)=3.746 -> 0.9365\n      hour20: (1.310, 1.066, 0.944, 0.914) -> (1.310+1.066+0.944+0.914)=4.234 -> 1.0585\n      hour21: (1.218, 1.005, 0.883, 0.944) -> (1.218+1.005+0.883+0.944)=4.05 -> 1.0125\n      hour22: (1.279, 0.944, 0.853, 0.975) -> (1.279+0.944+0.853+0.975)=4.051 -> 1.01275\n      hour23: (1.188, 1.097, 0.944, 0.853) -> (1.188+1.097+0.944+0.853)=4.082 -> 1.0205\n\n 18. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-06-06 00:00:00 to 2017-06-06 23:00:00 -> use the 24 averages above in order.\n      Day 2: 2017-06-07 00:00:00 to 2017-06-07 23:00:00 -> same 24 averages.\n      Day 3: 2017-06-08 00:00:00 to 2017-06-08 23:00:00 -> same.\n      Day 4: 2017-06-09 00:00:00 to 2017-06-09 23:00:00 -> same.\n\n 19. We must format the dates correctly: starting from 2017-06-06 00:00:00 and then incrementally by hour.\n\n 20. We output the data in the required format: two columns (date and LULL) with 96 rows.\n\n 21. We note that the original data had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 22. However, note: the average method does not account for any trend or non-seasonal changes. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 23. Let's consider: the last day (2017-06-05) has generally lower values? But we are taking the average of 4 days so it will be a bit smoothed.\n\n 24. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Start date: 2017-06-06 00:00:00\n   End date: 2017-06-09 23:00:00\n\n   We'll create a list of dates for 96 hours starting from 2017-06-06 00:00:00.\n\n   Then, for each date, we extract the hour (0 to 23) and assign the corresponding average we computed.\n\n 25. The averages by hour (0 to 23) are:\n\n      hour0: 1.21825 -> 1.218\n      hour1: 0.9745 -> 0.975\n      hour2: 1.0965 -> 1.097\n      hour3: 1.066 -> 1.066\n      hour4: 1.20325 -> 1.203\n      hour5: 1.028 -> 1.028\n      hour6: 1.188 -> 1.188\n      hour7: 1.1345 -> 1.135\n      hour8: 1.21825 -> 1.218\n      hour9: 1.11175 -> 1.112\n      hour10: 1.104 -> 1.104\n      hour11: 1.02025 -> 1.020\n      hour12: 1.04325 -> 1.043\n      hour13: 0.92175 -> 0.922\n      hour14: 1.02775 -> 1.028\n      hour15: 1.08125 -> 1.081\n      hour16: 1.11175 -> 1.112\n      hour17: 1.0585 -> 1.059\n      hour18: 0.9365 -> 0.937\n      hour19: 0.9365 -> 0.937\n      hour20: 1.0585 -> 1.059\n      hour21: 1.0125 -> 1.013\n      hour22: 1.01275 -> 1.013\n      hour23: 1.0205 -> 1.021\n\n 26. We round to 3 decimal places as in the original data.\n\n 27. Now, we write the data:\n\n     2017-06-06 00:00:00, 1.218\n     2017-06-06 01:00:00, 0.975\n     ... until 2017-06-09 23:00:00\n\n 28. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 29. Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. \n We are forecasting without gaps, so we produce 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 30. We output in the required format.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n",
