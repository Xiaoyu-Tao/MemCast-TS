        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-07-01 00:00:00 to 2016-07-04 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive records without any missing time stamps? \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided sample does not have any missing? \n    Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", we must handle missing values in the provided data if any. But in the given 96 points, there are no missing.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We must choose a model for time series forecasting. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps, we can use:\n    - SARIMA: because of potential seasonality (daily seasonality, i.e., 24 hours cycle).\n    - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or other models.\n\n 4. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast the next 4 days. This is a very short history.\n\n 5. Considering the data, we observe:\n    - There is a daily pattern? Let's check by looking at the same hour each day.\n\n    For example, at 00:00:\n        Day1: 30.531\n        Day2: 21.104\n        Day3: 29.335\n        Day4: 21.667\n\n    This does not show a clear pattern. But we have only 4 days. We might try to capture:\n    - Trend: The data does not show a clear long-term trend in 4 days.\n    - Seasonality: We suspect daily seasonality (period=24).\n\n 6. We will use a model that can handle seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we can try to fit a seasonal model with seasonality of 24.\n\n 7. We choose SARIMA. But note: with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be hard to estimate. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the past 4 days? \n    But that would be naive and might not capture the pattern.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to forecast 4 days, we can try to fit a model with:\n    - Non-seasonal part: (p,d,q) = (1,0,1) or (0,0,0) or ... \n    - Seasonal part: (P,D,Q,24) with P, D, Q to be chosen.\n\n 9. However, we are not allowed to run code, so we have to simulate the process.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n      - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual. Then forecast each component? But with only 4 days, decomposition is difficult.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the last 4 days to compute the average for each hour and then use that as the forecast? \n      But note: the data shows some non-stationarity? \n\n 12. Let's try to compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00: (30.531 + 21.104 + 29.335 + 21.667) / 4 = 25.65925\n      Hour 01: (27.787 + 19.697 + 26.028 + 25.536) / 4 = 24.762\n      ... and so on.\n\n 13. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from day5 to day8) would be the same as the average of the past 4 days for each hour.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says there might be missing values? In the provided data we don't have missing, but if we did, we would have to impute. \n      However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 15. This method is simple and might capture the daily pattern. However, it ignores any trend and recent changes.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the forecast? But that would be a naive forecast.\n\n 17. Considering the instructions and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we choose the average method.\n\n 18. Steps for the method:\n      - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n      - For each hour, compute the average of the 4 days.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 19. Let's compute the averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (30.531 + 21.104 + 29.335 + 21.667) / 4 = (102.637) / 4 = 25.65925\n      Hour 1: (27.787 + 19.697 + 26.028 + 25.536) / 4 = (99.048) / 4 = 24.762\n      Hour 2: (27.787 + 20.049 + 24.340 + 27.857) / 4 = (100.033) / 4 = 25.00825\n      Hour 3: (25.044 + 20.752 + 26.450 + 27.928) / 4 = (100.174) / 4 = 25.0435\n      Hour 4: (21.948 + 21.385 + 25.958 + 24.621) / 4 = (93.912) / 4 = 23.478\n      Hour 5: (21.174 + 22.230 + 24.059 + 23.848) / 4 = (91.311) / 4 = 22.82775\n      Hour 6: (22.792 + 20.260 + 25.325 + 23.074) / 4 = (91.451) / 4 = 22.86275\n      Hour 7: (23.144 + 21.104 + 23.637 + 22.511) / 4 = (90.396) / 4 = 22.599\n      Hour 8: (21.667 + 20.612 + 26.380 + 21.667) / 4 = (90.326) / 4 = 22.5815\n      Hour 9: (17.446 + 18.361 + 27.365 + 25.395) / 4 = (88.567) / 4 = 22.14175\n      Hour 10: (19.979 + 20.963 + 28.068 + 25.184) / 4 = (94.194) / 4 = 23.5485\n      Hour 11: (20.119 + 19.416 + 29.475 + 29.546) / 4 = (98.556) / 4 = 24.639\n      Hour 12: (19.205 + 20.823 + 26.802 + 29.475) / 4 = (96.305) / 4 = 24.07625\n      Hour 13: (18.572 + 20.190 + 29.968 + 29.264) / 4 = (97.994) / 4 = 24.4985\n      Hour 14: (19.556 + 21.315 + 30.390 + 30.953) / 4 = (102.214) / 4 = 25.5535\n      Hour 15: (17.305 + 22.019 + 31.164 + 31.726) / 4 = (102.214) / 4 = 25.5535  [Note: 17.305+22.019=39.324, 31.164+31.726=62.89 -> 102.214]\n      Actually: 17.305+22.019+31.164+31.726 = 102.214 -> 25.5535\n      Hour 16: (19.486 + 20.682 + 29.757 + 33.133) / 4 = (103.058) / 4 = 25.7645\n      Hour 17: (19.134 + 25.466 + 32.289 + 28.983) / 4 = (105.872) / 4 = 26.468\n      Hour 18: (20.682 + 25.888 + 31.938 + 28.983) / 4 = (107.491) / 4 = 26.87275\n      Hour 19: (18.712 + 27.857 + 28.561 + 31.726) / 4 = (106.856) / 4 = 26.714\n      Hour 20: (17.868 + 27.295 + 21.525 + 25.184) / 4 = (91.872) / 4 = 22.968\n      Hour 21: (18.009 + 22.230 + 22.230 + 30.531) / 4 = (93.000) / 4 = 93/4 = 23.25\n      Hour 22: (18.009 + 21.948 + 19.416 + 27.646) / 4 = (87.019) / 4 = 21.75475\n      Hour 23: (19.768 + 27.295 + 18.572 + 25.466) / 4 = (91.101) / 4 = 22.77525\n\n 20. Now, the next 96 hours (from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00) will be:\n\n      Day 5 (2016-07-05): \n          00:00:00 -> 25.65925\n          01:00:00 -> 24.762\n          02:00:00 -> 25.00825\n          ... until 23:00:00 -> 22.77525\n\n      Day 6 (2016-07-06): same as above\n      Day 7 (2016-07-07): same as above\n      Day 8 (2016-07-08): same as above\n\n 21. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 22. Format: \n        date (as in the example) and the OT value (with 6 decimal places? The original data had 6, but we see 3 decimal places. \n        However, the example shows up to 3 decimal places. We'll output with 6 decimal places as in the example, but the example had 3 to 6. \n        We'll output with 6 decimal places to be safe.\n\n 23. But note: the original data had mixed decimal places (some 3, some 6). We'll output with 6.\n\n 24. However, the problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\".\n\n 25. We generate 96 rows.\n\n 26. Let's write the dates:\n\n      Start: 2016-07-05 00:00:00\n      Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-07-08 23:00:00.\n\n 27. The hour of the day for each row will determine which average to use.\n\n 28. Example for 2016-07-05 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 25.65925\n        2016-07-05 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 24.762\n        ... \n        2016-07-05 23:00:00 -> hour23 -> 22.77525\n\n        2016-07-06 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 25.65925\n        ... and so on.\n\n 29. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns, 'date' and 'OT'\n\n 30. We note: the average values we computed are in the order of the hour of the day.\n\n 31. We'll create a list of the 24 average values:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            25.65925,   # hour0\n            24.762,\n            25.00825,\n            25.0435,\n            23.478,\n            22.82775,\n            22.86275,\n            22.599,\n            22.5815,\n            22.14175,\n            23.5485,\n            24.639,\n            24.07625,\n            24.4985,\n            25.5535,\n            25.5535,   # hour15\n            25.7645,\n            26.468,\n            26.87275,\n            26.714,\n            22.968,\n            23.25,\n            21.75475,\n            22.77525    # hour23\n        ]\n\n 32. Then for the next 96 hours, we cycle through this list 4 times.\n\n 33. We write the dates:\n\n        from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00\n\n 34. We must be cautious: the last date in the given data is 2016-07-04 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-07-05 00:00:00.\n\n 35. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 36. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast without missing.\n\n 37. We output the forecasted values.\n\n 38. Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n 39. We note: the average values we computed are with more than 3 decimal places. We'll round to 6 decimal places? \n      The original data had up to 6. We'll keep the computed precision and output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 40. But note: the example had 30.531000, so we output 6 decimal places.\n\n 41. We'll format each OT value as: %.6f\n\n 42. Steps:\n\n      hourly_avg = [25.65925, 24.762, 22.77525] ... (24 values)\n\n      dates = []\n      start_date = datetime(2016,7,5,0,0,0)\n      for i in range(96):\n          current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n          hour_of_day = current_date.hour\n          value = hourly_avg[hour_of_day]\n          # format the date string as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 43. We write the output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-07-05 00:00:00 25.659250\n2016-07-05 01:00:00 24.762000\n...\n2016-07-08 23:00:00 22.775250\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 44. But note: the original data had the date and OT in two columns. We output with the same alignment? \n      We'll output: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" then a space then the OT value with 6 decimal places.\n\n 45. We must generate 96 rows.\n\n 46. Let's do it.\n\n 47. However, note: the average for hour15 was 25.5535, but we have two hours (hour14 and hour15) with the same value? \n      Actually, we computed hour14 and hour15 separately. The hour15 was computed as 25.5535? \n      But wait, in the data:\n\n        Hour14: (19.556 + 21.315 + 30.390 + 30.953) = 102.214 -> 25.5535\n        Hour15: (17.305 + 22.019 + 31.164 + 31.726) = 102.214 -> 25.5535\n\n      That is a coincidence? \n\n 48. We'll use the computed averages.\n\n 49. Now, we write the 96 rows.\n\n 50. We note: the next 4 days are:\n\n        Day 5: 2016-07-05 (Tuesday) to 2016-07-08 (Friday)\n\n 51. We generate the data.\n\n 52. We output the entire block.\n\n 53. Since we are to provide the complete data, we write all 96 rows.\n\n 54. We must be cautious: the hour index: 0 to 23.\n\n 55. We'll generate:\n\n        for day in range(4):   # 4 days\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)   # but note: we can also do by hours: 0 to 95\n                # actually, we can do: base = datetime(2016,7,5,0,0,0)\n                # then for i in 0..95: date = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n\n 56. We do:\n\n        base = datetime(2016,7,5,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n            hour_index = current.hour\n            ot_value = hourly_avg[hour_index]\n\n 57. We write the string: \n          f\"{current.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')} {ot_value:.6f}\"\n\n 58. But note: the original data had the OT in a column with the same number of decimal places? We output 6.\n\n 59. We output the list.\n\n 60. We note: the averages we computed as floats, and we format to 6 decimal places.\n\n 61. Let's do it.\n\n 62. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" so we output 96 lines.\n\n 63. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 64. We note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are generating a complete set.\n\n 65. We output.\n\n 66. We must be cautious: the original data had the date as index? But we output as two columns.\n\n 67.
