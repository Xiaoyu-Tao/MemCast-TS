        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours).\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data? But the given 96 points are complete. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete. So we assume that the provided history is complete, but we must handle potential missing values in the forecasting process? Actually, the instruction says \"be aware of that\", meaning we should be prepared for missing values in the provided history? But in the given data, there are no missing values. So we proceed with the given complete history.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a time series model that handles seasonality. Since the data is at hourly frequency and we have daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Given the small data (only 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (i.e., the previous day) as forecast. But note: the pattern might change over the week? We only have 4 days (Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). The next 4 days would be Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed.\n\n However, we have only one week of data? Actually, 4 days. We don't have multiple weeks. So we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality (if we assume additive or multiplicative seasonality)\n   - ARIMA with seasonal components (SARIMA)\n\n But note: we have only 96 points. A full SARIMA model might be too complex to fit with multiple parameters.\n\n Since the problem says the data might have missing values, but our history is complete, we can use a simple method that is robust.\n\n Approach:\n   We will use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonally adjusted series with a simple method (like linear regression or drift) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n Steps for decomposition:\n   - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n   - Since we have 4 days, the seasonal component can be estimated by averaging each hour of the day over the 4 days? But 4 days is very short.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last season (the last day) as the seasonal component and then adjust by a trend.\n\n However, let's observe the data: \n   The data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days. It fluctuates daily.\n\n Given the constraints, a simple and effective method is the Seasonal Naive method, where we use the value from the same time in the previous season (i.e., one day before) as the forecast.\n\n But note: the next 96 hours start at 2016-07-25 00:00:00, which is a Monday? Actually, 2016-07-21 is Thursday? Let me check:\n\n  2016-07-21: Thursday\n  2016-07-22: Friday\n  2016-07-23: Saturday\n  2016-07-24: Sunday\n\n Then the next 4 days:\n  2016-07-25: Monday\n  2016-07-26: Tuesday\n  2016-07-27: Wednesday\n  2016-07-28: Thursday\n\n So the days of the week are different. However, we don't have multiple weeks to capture weekly patterns. Therefore, we can only rely on the daily pattern.\n\n We can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But note: the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) might be different from weekdays.\n\n However, we have only one Sunday (2016-07-24) and one Saturday (2016-07-23). We don't have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in the history.\n\n Given the limited data, we can do:\n\n   Option 1: Use the last day (Sunday, 2016-07-24) as the forecast for the next day (Monday, 2016-07-25). Then use the same Sunday for Tuesday? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Option 2: Use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days? But then we are averaging weekdays and weekend.\n\n   Option 3: Since we have only 4-day history, we can use the entire history to compute the daily pattern and then assume that the next 4 days will follow the same pattern? But without trend.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the day of the week effect. We have to make an assumption.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, I propose:\n\n   We use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to form a daily profile. Then we use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n   - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat this daily profile 4 times.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level of each day:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-07-21): average = (12.046+14.676+...+11.122)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n        but from the data, we see values between 5.686 and 14.676 -> average around 9-10?\n   Day 2: similar\n   Day 3: similar\n   Day 4: similar\n\n We can compute the daily average:\n\n   Day1: 96 points? Actually, 24 hours per day -> 4 days.\n\n   We can compute the mean for each day:\n\n     Day1 (2016-07-21): \n        mean = (12.046+14.676+12.793+11.904+11.051+11.371+11.762+11.371+10.980+9.594+7.427+8.031+5.899+7.107+7.036+5.970+6.112+6.219+5.934+5.686+7.853+10.447+10.447+11.122) / 24\n        = 9.15 (approx)\n\n     Day2: \n        = (11.975+13.077+11.194+9.772+7.782+8.315+8.102+7.427+7.889+8.848+7.569+7.676+7.356+7.249+8.031+7.320+6.716+7.107+6.610+6.361+8.742+8.848+11.549+9.950) /24\n        = 8.5 (approx)\n\n     Day3: \n        = (10.909+10.554+9.843+10.732+9.523+8.955+8.777+9.310+7.071+7.960+7.818+7.782+7.285+7.924+7.853+7.818+7.356+7.711+7.214+7.356+9.914+10.021+11.229+11.442) /24\n        = 8.9 (approx)\n\n     Day4:\n        = (10.234+12.046+11.940+11.371+10.234+10.661+9.701+9.808+8.031+8.209+8.671+8.742+8.671+9.417+8.706+8.528+8.280+8.031+7.604+8.599+10.732+10.625+12.793+12.899) /24\n        = 9.8 (approx)\n\n   The daily averages are: 9.15, 8.5, 8.9, 9.8 -> no clear trend? It goes down then up.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the daily profile without adjusting the level? Or we can adjust the level by the last known day's average? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the overall average of the entire 96 points and then use the daily profile.\n\n   But note: the last day (Sunday) has a higher average (9.8) than the previous days. The next day (Monday) might be more similar to the weekdays? But we don't have Monday in the past.\n\n   Given the uncertainty, I propose to use the daily profile (the average of the same hour over the 4 days) and then scale it by the last day's average? \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n      Let P(h) = average of hour h over the 4 days.\n\n      Then for the next 4 days, we use P(h) for each day? \n\n   However, the level of the series might be changing. We can use the last day's average (9.8) as the base and then adjust the profile to have that average? \n\n   But note: the profile P(h) has an average of (9.15+8.5+8.9+9.8)/4 = 9.0875. \n\n   We want the next days to have a level that is more recent? We can use the last day (Sunday) as the level and then adjust:\n\n      Forecast for day5 (Monday) at hour h = P(h) * (average of day4 / overall average of P) \n        = P(h) * (9.8 / 9.0875) \n\n   But this multiplicative adjustment might not be appropriate if the pattern is additive.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do an additive adjustment:\n\n      Forecast for day5 at hour h = P(h) + (average of day4 - overall average of P)\n\n   However, we don't know if the change is additive or multiplicative.\n\n   Since the data does not show a clear trend and the variation is not huge, we can use the simple average profile without adjustment? \n\n   But the last day is higher, so we might want to carry that level. \n\n   Another idea: use the last day (day4) as the profile for the next day? Then for the following days, we can use the same profile? But then we are ignoring the first 3 days.\n\n   However, the problem says we have 96 points and we are to forecast 96 points. We must use the entire history? \n\n   Considering the above, I choose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form the daily profile, and then use that profile for the next 4 days without adjustment.\n\n   Why without adjustment? Because we don't have a clear trend and the daily profile is the most prominent pattern.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. For each hour in 0-23, compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n\n        hour0: (12.046 + 11.975 + 10.909 + 10.234) / 4\n        hour1: (14.676 + 13.077 + 10.554 + 12.046) / 4\n        ... \n\n     2. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is the repetition of this daily pattern 4 times.\n\n   But note: the last day (Sunday) was higher than the previous days. This method will smooth out the Sunday effect. However, without more data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (Sunday) as the profile for Monday, and then for Tuesday we use the average of the same hour of Sunday and Monday? But we don't have Monday forecasted? \n\n   We are forecasting 4 days at once. We can do:\n\n        Day5 (Monday) = day4 (Sunday) \n        Day6 (Tuesday) = day3 (Saturday)  -> but Saturday is a weekend day? and Tuesday is a weekday? \n        Day7 (Wednesday) = day2 (Friday)\n        Day8 (Thursday) = day1 (Thursday)\n\n   This is a seasonal naive with a seasonality of 1 day? But then we are using the same day of the previous week? We don't have a week of data. We have 4 days.\n\n   Actually, we don't have a full week. So we can only use the available days. This method would be:\n\n        Day5: use day4 (Sunday)\n        Day6: use day3 (Saturday)\n        Day7: use day2 (Friday)\n        Day8: use day1 (Thursday)\n\n   But note: the pattern of Thursday (day1) might be different from a Thursday that is 1 week later? \n\n   However, we don't have a choice. This method uses the most recent day for the same day of the week? But we don't have the same day of the week for Monday and Tuesday? \n\n   Actually, we have:\n\n        Monday: we don't have a Monday in the history -> use Sunday? \n        Tuesday: we don't have -> use Saturday?\n        Wednesday: we don't have -> use Friday?\n        Thursday: we have one Thursday (day1) -> use that.\n\n   But the Thursday we have is from last week? Actually, the history is from Thursday to Sunday, and we are forecasting the next Monday to Thursday? So:\n\n        Monday: use the most recent Sunday? \n        Tuesday: use the most recent Saturday?\n        Wednesday: use the most recent Friday?\n        Thursday: use the most recent Thursday? (which is 7 days ago? but we have only 4 days, so 4 days ago)\n\n   This is a common approach: use the same day from the previous week. But we don't have a full week. We can use:\n\n        Monday: use Sunday (1 day before) -> but Sunday is not Monday.\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n   Given the complexity and the lack of data, I think the average profile is a safe method.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (12.046, 11.975, 10.909, 10.234) -> (12.046+11.975+10.909+10.234)/4 = 11.291\n        hour1: (14.676, 13.077, 10.554, 12.046) -> (14.676+13.077+10.554+12.046)/4 = 12.58825\n        ... \n\n   Then the forecast for:\n\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00: 11.291\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00: 12.588\n        ... and so on for 4 days.\n\n   We'll compute all 24 hours and then repeat 4 times.\n\n   However, note: the data has some variation. The average might smooth out the pattern. But it's the best we can do with 4 days.\n\n   Let's do the computation for all 24 hours.\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and average the 4 values.\n\n   Hour 0: (12.046 + 11.975 + 10.909 + 10.234) / 4 = 11.291\n   Hour 1: (14.676 + 13.077 + 10.554 + 12.046) / 4 = 12.58825\n   Hour 2: (12.793 + 11.194 + 9.843 + 11.940) / 4 = 11.4425\n   Hour 3: (11.904 + 9.772 + 10.732 + 11.371) / 4 = 10.94475\n   Hour 4: (11.051 + 7.782 + 9.523 + 10.234) / 4 = 9.6475\n   Hour 5: (11.371 + 8.315 + 8.955 + 10.661) / 4 = 9.8255\n   Hour 6: (11.762 + 8.102 + 8.777 + 9.701) / 4 = 9.5855\n   Hour 7: (11.371 + 7.427 + 9.310 + 9.808) / 4 = 9.479\n   Hour 8: (10.980 + 7.889 + 7.071 + 8.031) / 4 = 8.49275\n   Hour 9: (9.594 + 8.848 + 7.960 + 8.209) / 4 = 8.65275\n   Hour10: (7.427 + 7.569 + 7.818 + 8.671) / 4 = 7.87125\n   Hour11: (8.031 + 7.676 + 7.782 + 8.742) / 4 = 8.05775\n   Hour12: (5.899 + 7.356 + 7.285 + 8.671) / 4 = 7.30275\n   Hour13: (7.107 + 7.249 + 7.924 + 9.417) / 4 = 7.92425\n   Hour14: (7.036 + 8.031 + 7.853 + 8.706) / 4 = 7.9065\n   Hour15: (5.970 + 7.320 + 7.818 + 8.528) / 4 = 7.409\n   Hour16: (6.112 + 6.716 + 7.356 + 8.280) / 4 = 7.116\n   Hour17: (6.219 + 7.107 + 7.711 + 8.031) / 4 = 7.267\n   Hour18: (5.934 + 6.610 + 7.214 + 7.604) / 4 = 6.8405\n   Hour19: (5.686 + 6.361 + 7.356 + 8.599) / 4 = 7.0005\n   Hour20: (7.853 + 8.742 + 9.914 + 10.732) / 4 = 9.31025\n   Hour21: (10.447 + 8.848 + 10.021 + 10.625) / 4 = 9.98525\n   Hour22: (10.447 + 11.549 + 11.229 + 12.793) / 4 = 11.5045\n   Hour23: (11.122 + 9.950 + 11.442 + 12.899) / 4 = 11.35325\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00) is:\n\n        Day1 (Monday, 2016-07-25): [11.291, 12.58825, 11.4425, ... , 11.35325]\n        Day2 (Tuesday): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (Wednesday): same\n        Day4 (Thursday): same\n\n   But note: the actual Thursday (2016-07-28) might be different from the average? But we don't have a better estimate.\n\n   We output the forecast in the same structure as the input, with the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted MUFL.\n\n   Format:\n\n        date, MUFL\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00, 11.291\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00, 12.58825\n        ... \n\n   We must round to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are not given any in the history. We are forecasting without gaps.\n\n   We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-25 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-07-24 23:00:00)\n        Then hourly until 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-25 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        then 2016-07-26 00:00:00 to 2016-07-26 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        then 2016-07-27 00:00:00 to 2016-07-27 23:00:00\n        then 2016-07-28 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00\n\n   Total 96 hours.\n\n   We'll create a list of 96 values by repeating the daily profile (24 values) 4 times.\n\n   Let's write the daily profile (24 values) with 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: 11.291 -> 11.291\n        hour1: 12.58825 -> 12.588\n        hour2: 11.4425 -> 11.443 (rounding: 11.4425 -> 11.443? but 5 is exactly in the middle -> we round to even? but typically we round 0.0005 up. So 11.443)\n        However, the input had 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals by rounding half up.\n\n        We'll use: \n            hour0: 11.291 -> 11.291\n            hour1: 12.58825 -> 12.588\n            because 0.00025 is less than 0.0005? Actually, we are rounding to 3 decimals: 12.58825 -> look at the 4th decimal is 2, so we round down -> 12.588.\n\n        Let me do:\n\n            hour0: 11.291 -> 11.291\n            hour1: 12.58825 -> 12.588\n            hour2: 11.4425 -> 11.443 (because 0.0005: round half up -> 11.443)\n            hour3: 10.94475 -> 10.945\n            hour4: 9.6475 -> 9.648\n            hour5: 9.8255 -> 9.826\n            hour6: 9.5855 -> 9.586\n            hour7: 9.479 -> 9.479\n            hour8: 8.49275 -> 8.493\n            hour9: 8.65275 -> 8.653\n            hour10: 7.87125 -> 7.871\n            hour11: 8.05775 -> 8.058\n            hour12: 7.30275 -> 7.303\n            hour13: 7.92425 -> 7.924\n            hour14: 7.9065 -> 7.907\n            hour15: 7.409 -> 7.409\n            hour16: 7.116 -> 7.116\n            hour17: 7.267 -> 7.267\n            hour18: 6.8405 -> 6.841\n            hour19: 7.0005 -> 7.001\n            hour20: 9.31025 -> 9.310\n            hour21: 9.98525 -> 9.985\n            hour22: 11.5045 -> 11.505\n            hour23: 11.35325 -> 11.353\n\n   But note: the input had values like 12.046, 14.676, etc. So we can have 3 decimals.\n\n   Now, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        day1: 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        day2: 2016-07-26 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        day3: 2016-07-27 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        day4: 2016-07-28 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n   We write the data in the format:\n\n        date, MUFL\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00, 11.291\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00, 12.588\n        ... \n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's code this in the answer.\n\n   Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   We output the entire 96 forecasted points.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,MUFL\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00,11.291\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00,12.588\n        ... \n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the example input had a space after the comma? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2016-07-21 00:00:00 12.046\"\n\n   But in the example, it was separated by space? Actually, the example has:\n\n        \"2016-07-21 00:00:00 12.046\"\n\n   But the header is \"date   MUFL\", so it's space separated? However, the problem says \"give me the complete data\" and the format in the example output is not specified. But the input was given with space.\n\n   We'll output with a comma for clarity? Or space? The problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", and the example input had space. But the example output format in the problem statement was not specified.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n        ...\n        \n        </answer>\"\n\n   And the example input was printed with space. But we can use space to separate? \n\n   Let me check the input: it was:\n\n        \"2016-07-21 00:00:00 12.046\"\n\n   So we'll use: [date string] [space] [MUFL value]\n\n   We'll not use comma.\n\n   So:\n\n        \"2016-07-25 00:00:00 11.291\"\n\n   We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        dates = []\n        start = datetime(2016,7,25,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            date = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n        values = [ the 24-hour profile repeated 4 times ]\n\n   We have the profile as a list of 24 numbers (rounded to 3 decimals) and then we do:\n\n        values_forecast = profile * 4   (i.e., repeat the list 4 times)\n\n   Then we output:\n\n        for i in range(96):\n            line = f\"{date_str} {value:.3f}\"\n\n   Let's do it.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: We are not using the exact same method as the example input (which had 3 decimals). We round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        day0: 2016-07-25 00:00:00, 2016-07-25 01:00:00, ... 2016-07-25 23:00:00\n        day1: 2016-07-26 00:00:00, ... until 2016-07-26 23:00:00\n        day2: 2016-07-27 00:00:00 ... \n        day3: 2016-07-28 00:00:00 ... 2016-07-28 23:00:00\n\n   We'll compute the profile once and then output.\n\n   Let me write the profile (24 values) with rounding:\n\n        hour0: 11.291\n        hour1: 12.588\n        hour2: 11.443\n        hour3: 10.945\n        hour4: 9.648\n        hour5: 9.826\n        hour6: 9.586\n        hour7: 9.479\n        hour8: 8.493\n        hour9: 8.653\n        hour10: 7.871\n        hour11: 8.058\n        hour12: 7.303\n        hour13: 7.924\n        hour14: 7.907\n        hour15: 7.409\n        hour16: 7.116\n        hour17: 7.267\n        hour18: 6.841\n        hour19: 7.001\n        hour20: 9.310\n        hour21: 9.985\n        hour22: 11.505\n        hour23: 11.353\n\n   Then the forecast for the first day (Monday, 2016-07-25) is:\n\n        00:00:00 -> 11.291\n        01:00:00 -> 12.588\n        02:00:00 -> 11.443\n        03:00:00 -> 10.945\n        04:00:00 -> 9.648\n        05:00:00 -> 9.826\n        06:00:00 -> 9.586\n        07:00:00 -> 9.479\n        08:00:00 -> 8.493\n        09:00:00 -> 8.653\n        10:00:00 -> 7.871\n        11:00:00 -> 8.058\n        12:00:00 -> 7.303\n        13:00:00 -> 7.924\n        14:00:00 -> 7.907\n        15:00:00 -> 7.409\n        16:00:00 -> 7.116\n        17:00:00 -> 7.267\n        18:00:00 -> 6.841\n        19:00:00 -> 7.001\n        20:00:00 -> 9.310\n        21:00:00 -> 9.985\n        22:00:00 -> 11.505\n        23:00:00 -> 11.353\n\n   Then the next day (Tuesday) is the same.\n\n   We output 4 times.\n\n   We write the answer.\n\n   Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
