        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to predict the next 96 hours (4 days).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we will use the given 96 points as a complete series.\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the hourly pattern, we can consider:\n    - The data shows a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, we see peaks and troughs at similar hours.\n    - We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) and we want to forecast 96 points (next 4 days), we can use a seasonal method.\n\n 4. Given the small data size, we can use a simple seasonal decomposition and then forecast using a naive seasonal method (like seasonal naive) or a more sophisticated one. However, note that the data might have trends and other patterns.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. But with only 4 days, it might be challenging to fit multiple components.\n\n 6. Another approach is to use an autoregressive model (like SARIMA) but again, we have limited data.\n\n 7. Considering the constraints, we have to forecast 96 points. We can use a simple method: \n    - Calculate the average pattern for each hour of the day over the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n    We have 4 days. We can average the same hour across the 4 days to get an hourly profile.\n\n    But: the data from 2017-02-06 to 2017-02-09 might have a trend? Let's see:\n\n    Day 1 (02-06): starts at 0.579, ends at 0.640\n    Day 2 (02-07): starts at 1.157, ends at 0.548\n    Day 3 (02-08): starts at 0.457, ends at 0.548\n    Day 4 (02-09): starts at 0.579, ends at 0.670\n\n    The pattern is not stable. The starting point varies: 0.579, 1.157, 0.457, 0.579.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the last day (02-09) as the pattern for the next days? But the problem says to forecast 4 days.\n\n 9. Given the variability, we are to forecast 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a typical day, then replicate that for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n        - Group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean.\n\n    However, note that the first day (02-06) is a Monday? We don't have the day of week, but the data is from 2017-02-06 (Monday) to 2017-02-09 (Thursday). \n    The next 4 days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? But we don't have weekend data to average. So, we have to be cautious.\n\n 10. Since we only have 4 days (Monday to Thursday) and we are forecasting the next 4 days (Friday to Monday), we might not have weekly seasonality? But we don't have data for Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n 11. Given the challenge, we can do:\n     Option 1: Use the entire 4 days to form an hourly average and use that for the next 4 days. This assumes that the pattern is the same every day of the week? But we don't have evidence for weekends.\n\n     Option 2: Use the last day (Thursday) as the pattern for Friday? and then use the same pattern for the next days? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 12. Considering the instructions and the fact that we must provide a forecast, we will go with the hourly average over the 4 days. This is a simple and robust approach for short-term forecasting when we have limited data.\n\n    Steps:\n        - We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n        - Compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days) we repeat the same hourly means.\n\n 13. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have a clear trend in the overall level? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-06: average = (0.579+0.548+...+0.640)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n            from the data, we see values between 0.4 and 0.9, average around 0.65?\n        Day2: 2017-02-07: starts at 1.157, then goes down, average might be higher? \n        Day3: 2017-02-08: starts at 0.457, then goes up, average might be lower?\n        Day4: 2017-02-09: similar to day1?\n\n    We can compute the daily average:\n\n        Day1: \n            sum = 0.579+0.548+0.609+0.701+0.731+0.701+0.701+0.426+0.548+0.670+0.670+0.670+0.670+0.640+0.640+0.670+0.944+0.548+0.518+0.670+0.548+0.579+0.640+0.640\n            = 15.289\n            average = 15.289 / 24 = 0.637\n\n        Day2: \n            sum = 1.157+1.097+1.188+0.914+0.914+0.944+0.457+0.609+0.487+0.518+0.548+0.670+0.701+0.701+0.609+0.701+1.005+0.701+0.487+0.701+0.701+0.701+0.640+0.548\n            = 17.35\n            average = 17.35 / 24 = 0.723\n\n        Day3:\n            sum = 0.457+0.457+0.426+0.396+0.366+0.426+0.426+0.487+0.640+0.670+0.640+0.609+0.548+0.640+0.579+0.761+0.822+0.701+0.822+0.761+0.761+0.761+0.640+0.548\n            = 14.224\n            average = 14.224 / 24 = 0.593\n\n        Day4:\n            sum = 0.579+0.609+0.548+0.518+0.548+0.548+0.518+0.548+0.457+0.579+0.640+0.761+0.701+0.609+0.640+0.731+0.731+0.761+0.640+0.792+0.731+0.731+0.701+0.670\n            = 15.292\n            average = 15.292 / 24 = 0.637\n\n    The daily averages: 0.637, 0.723, 0.593, 0.637 -> no clear trend? \n\n    So, we can use the hourly average without adjusting the level.\n\n 14. How to handle if there are missing values in the future? The problem says the data will have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data for the next 96. So we are to forecast all 96.\n\n 15. We will:\n        - Compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) across the 4 days.\n        - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00), we assign the average value for that hour.\n\n 16. Steps for computation:\n\n        hour0: (0.579 + 1.157 + 0.457 + 0.579) / 4 = (2.772) / 4 = 0.693\n        hour1: (0.548 + 1.097 + 0.457 + 0.609) / 4 = (2.711) / 4 = 0.67775\n        ... and so on.\n\n 17. We must generate 96 data points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n 18. The dates: \n        Start: 2017-02-10 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2017-02-09)\n        Then 2017-02-10 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n 19. We'll compute the average for each hour (from 0 to 23) and then repeat that for 4 days.\n\n 20. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (0.579, 1.157, 0.457, 0.579) -> mean = (0.579+1.157+0.457+0.579)/4 = 2.772/4 = 0.693\n        hour1: (0.548, 1.097, 0.457, 0.609) -> (0.548+1.097+0.457+0.609)=2.711 -> 0.67775\n        hour2: (0.609, 1.188, 0.426, 0.548) -> (0.609+1.188+0.426+0.548)=2.771 -> 0.69275\n        hour3: (0.701, 0.914, 0.396, 0.518) -> (0.701+0.914+0.396+0.518)=2.529 -> 0.63225\n        hour4: (0.731, 0.914, 0.366, 0.548) -> (0.731+0.914+0.366+0.548)=2.559 -> 0.63975\n        hour5: (0.701, 0.944, 0.426, 0.548) -> (0.701+0.944+0.426+0.548)=2.619 -> 0.65475\n        hour6: (0.701, 0.457, 0.426, 0.518) -> (0.701+0.457+0.426+0.518)=2.102 -> 0.5255\n        hour7: (0.426, 0.609, 0.487, 0.548) -> (0.426+0.609+0.487+0.548)=2.07 -> 0.5175\n        hour8: (0.548, 0.487, 0.640, 0.457) -> (0.548+0.487+0.640+0.457)=2.132 -> 0.533\n        hour9: (0.670, 0.518, 0.670, 0.579) -> (0.670+0.518+0.670+0.579)=2.437 -> 0.60925\n        hour10: (0.670, 0.548, 0.640, 0.640) -> (0.670+0.548+0.640+0.640)=2.498 -> 0.6245\n        hour11: (0.670, 0.670, 0.609, 0.761) -> (0.670+0.670+0.609+0.761)=2.71 -> 0.6775\n        hour12: (0.670, 0.701, 0.548, 0.701) -> (0.670+0.701+0.548+0.701)=2.62 -> 0.655\n        hour13: (0.640, 0.701, 0.640, 0.609) -> (0.640+0.701+0.640+0.609)=2.59 -> 0.6475\n        hour14: (0.640, 0.609, 0.579, 0.640) -> (0.640+0.609+0.579+0.640)=2.468 -> 0.617\n        hour15: (0.670, 0.701, 0.761, 0.731) -> (0.670+0.701+0.761+0.731)=2.863 -> 0.71575\n        hour16: (0.944, 1.005, 0.822, 0.731) -> (0.944+1.005+0.822+0.731)=3.502 -> 0.8755\n        hour17: (0.548, 0.701, 0.701, 0.761) -> (0.548+0.701+0.701+0.761)=2.711 -> 0.67775\n        hour18: (0.518, 0.487, 0.822, 0.640) -> (0.518+0.487+0.822+0.640)=2.467 -> 0.61675\n        hour19: (0.670, 0.701, 0.761, 0.792) -> (0.670+0.701+0.761+0.792)=2.924 -> 0.731\n        hour20: (0.548, 0.701, 0.761, 0.731) -> (0.548+0.701+0.761+0.731)=2.741 -> 0.68525\n        hour21: (0.579, 0.701, 0.761, 0.731) -> (0.579+0.701+0.761+0.731)=2.772 -> 0.693\n        hour22: (0.640, 0.640, 0.640, 0.701) -> (0.640+0.640+0.640+0.701)=2.621 -> 0.65525\n        hour23: (0.640, 0.548, 0.548, 0.670) -> (0.640+0.548+0.548+0.670)=2.406 -> 0.6015\n\n 21. Now, for the next 4 days (2017-02-10 to 2017-02-13), we assign:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-10): \n            00:00:00 -> 0.693\n            01:00:00 -> 0.67775\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 0.6015\n\n        Day2 (2017-02-11): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-02-12): same\n        Day4 (2017-02-13): same\n\n 22. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'LULL'\n\n 23. We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 (which is the next after 2017-02-09 23:00:00).\n\n 24. The last date in the input is 2017-02-09 23:00:00, so the next is 2017-02-10 00:00:00.\n\n 25. We'll create 96 rows.\n\n 26. Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-10 00:00:00 0.693\n2017-02-10 01:00:00 0.67775\n...\n2017-02-13 23:00:00 0.6015\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 27. But note: the input data had 3 decimal places. We should round to 3 decimal places? The input data had up to 3 decimal places. So we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n    However, note that the average might have more than 3 decimal places. We round to 3.\n\n    Example: hour0: 0.693 -> 0.693\n             hour1: 0.67775 -> 0.678 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n 28. Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        hour0: 0.693 -> 0.693\n        hour1: 0.67775 -> 0.678\n        hour2: 0.69275 -> 0.693\n        hour3: 0.63225 -> 0.632\n        hour4: 0.63975 -> 0.640\n        hour5: 0.65475 -> 0.655\n        hour6: 0.5255 -> 0.526\n        hour7: 0.5175 -> 0.518\n        hour8: 0.533 -> 0.533\n        hour9: 0.60925 -> 0.609\n        hour10: 0.6245 -> 0.625\n        hour11: 0.6775 -> 0.678\n        hour12: 0.655 -> 0.655\n        hour13: 0.6475 -> 0.648\n        hour14: 0.617 -> 0.617\n        hour15: 0.71575 -> 0.716\n        hour16: 0.8755 -> 0.876\n        hour17: 0.67775 -> 0.678\n        hour18: 0.61675 -> 0.617\n        hour19: 0.731 -> 0.731\n        hour20: 0.68525 -> 0.685\n        hour21: 0.693 -> 0.693\n        hour22: 0.65525 -> 0.655\n        hour23: 0.6015 -> 0.602\n\n 29. Now, we write the next 4 days with these 24 values repeated.\n\n 30. We generate the dates:\n\n        day1: 2017-02-10\n        day2: 2017-02-11\n        day3: 2017-02-12\n        day4: 2017-02-13\n\n        For each day, we have 24 hours: from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n 31. We output:\n\n        date, LULL (rounded to 3 decimals)\n\n 32. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 33. Let's code the output.\n\n 34. We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-10 00:00:00 0.693\n2017-02-10 01:00:00 0.678\n2017-02-10 02:00:00 0.693\n2017-02-10 03:00:00 0.632\n2017-02-10 04:00:00 0.640\n2017-02-10 05:00:00 0.655\n2017-02-10 06:00:00 0.526\n2017-02-10 07:00:00 0.518\n2017-02-10 08:00:00 0.533\n2017-02-10 09:00:00 0.609\n2017-02-10 10:00:00 0.625\n2017-02-10 11:00:00 0.678\n2017-02-10 12:00:00 0.655\n2017-02-10 13:00:00 0.648\n2017-02-10 14:00:00 0.617\n2017-02-10 15:00:00 0.716\n2017-02-10 16:00:00 0.876\n2017-02-10 17:00:00 0.678\n2017-02-10 18:00:00 0.617\n2017-02-10 19:00:00 0.731\n2017-02-10 20:00:00 0.685\n2017-02-10 21:00:00 0.693\n2017-02-10 22:00:00 0.655\n2017-02-10 23:00:00 0.602\n2017-02-11 00:00:00 0.693\n2017-02-11 01:00:00 0.678\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 35. We note that the same 24 values repeat for each day.\n\n 36. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 37. We output in the exact string format.\n\n 38.
