        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-09-22 00:00:00 to 2017-09-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive hours without any missing entries? \n    However, the problem states: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n    But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing. So we must be prepared to handle missing values in the forecasting process.\n\n 2. Since the data is at hourly frequency, we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 3. We must choose a suitable time series forecasting method. Given the data, we can observe:\n    - There is a daily seasonality (24 hours) because the pattern repeats every day.\n    - The data also shows some level of non-stationarity (varying mean and variance).\n\n 4. We can use a model that handles seasonality. One common approach is SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). However, with 96 points, we have 4 days (4*24=96). \n    We can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing methods that handle seasonality, such as Holt-Winters.\n\n 6. However, note that the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n    But if in the future steps we are to forecast, we are not given any missing values in the provided history? \n    So we can assume the provided history is complete? \n\n 7. Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", we must be cautious. But the provided 96 points are complete. \n    So for the purpose of forecasting, we can use the provided 96 points as a complete series.\n\n 8. We will use the Exponential Smoothing model (Holt-Winters) because it can handle seasonality and is robust for short-term forecasting.\n\n 9. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n    - We have to choose between additive and multiplicative seasonality. \n    - Looking at the data, the seasonality does not seem to change in amplitude over the short period, so additive might be appropriate.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a SARIMA model. Let's try to see which one fits better.\n\n 11. However, we are not going to actually run the model because we are in a text-based environment. \n     We have to simulate the forecasting by providing a plausible output.\n\n 12. But note: the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates (which are hourly from the last point: 2017-09-25 23:00:00).\n\n 13. We must generate 96 new data points starting from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n 14. Since we cannot run the model here, we have to provide a reasonable forecast. We can base it on the patterns in the last 4 days.\n\n 15. Observing the data:\n     - Each day, the temperature starts low at night, then rises during the day, and peaks in the afternoon, then falls again.\n     - The minimums and maximums vary by day.\n\n 16. We can take the average of the last 4 days for each hour and then adjust for any trend? But the data shows a possible increasing trend? \n     Let's check the last day (2017-09-25) had higher temperatures than the previous days.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last day (2017-09-25) as the base and add a small trend? \n     But we don't have a clear trend over 4 days.\n\n 18. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by:\n     a) Computing the average daily pattern (over the 4 days) for each hour (0 to 23).\n     b) Then, we note that the overall level of the time series might be increasing. We can compute the average of each day and then project the next 4 days by linear extrapolation of the daily averages? \n        But we only have 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps for generating the forecast:\n\n     Let's denote:\n        Day0: 2017-09-22 (Friday) -> index 0 to 23\n        Day1: 2017-09-23 (Saturday) -> index 24 to 47\n        Day2: 2017-09-24 (Sunday) -> index 48 to 71\n        Day3: 2017-09-25 (Monday) -> index 72 to 95\n\n     We can compute the daily average for each day:\n        Day0: average of indices 0-23\n        Day1: average of indices 24-47\n        Day2: average of indices 48-71\n        Day3: average of indices 72-95\n\n     Then, we can fit a linear regression to these 4 points (x=0,1,2,3) and then predict for x=4,5,6,7 (which would be the next 4 days).\n\n     Then, for each hour in the day, we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the daily level.\n\n     However, we can also consider the possibility of a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon). \n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Monday) as the base and then adjust by the average hourly deviation from the daily mean? \n\n 21. We'll do:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the hourly averages for the 4 days (without detrending) for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values. Then take the 4 values and average them? \n        But note: the level of the day is changing.\n\n     Step 2: Instead, we can remove the daily mean and then compute the hourly deviations.\n\n        For each day d and hour h, let:\n            value(d, h) = daily_mean(d) + deviation(h) + noise\n\n        We can compute the deviation for hour h as the average of [value(d, h) - daily_mean(d)] over d=0 to 3.\n\n     Step 3: Then, we predict the daily mean for the next 4 days (d=4,5,6,7) by linear extrapolation of the daily means of d=0,1,2,3.\n\n     Step 4: Then, the forecast for day d (d=4,5,6,7) and hour h is:\n            forecast(d, h) = predicted_daily_mean(d) + deviation(h)\n\n 22. But note: we only have 4 days, so the linear extrapolation might be weak. We can also use the last daily mean and assume it remains constant? \n     However, looking at the daily means:\n\n        Day0: 2017-09-22: \n            mean = (12.17+11.889+...+13.858)/24 -> let's compute quickly:\n\n            We can approximate: \n                The values: \n                00:12.17, 01:11.89, 02:12.80, 03:12.59, 04:12.80, 05:13.23, 06:13.44, 07:13.79, 08:14.00, 09:14.98, 10:15.62, 11:15.20, \n                12:15.76, 13:16.32, 14:16.25, 15:15.41, 16:15.34, 17:14.91, 18:14.42, 19:13.86, 20:13.44, 21:13.16, 22:13.72, 23:13.86\n\n            Sum = 12.17+11.89+12.80+12.59+12.80+13.23+13.44+13.79+14.00+14.98+15.62+15.20+15.76+16.32+16.25+15.41+15.34+14.91+14.42+13.86+13.44+13.16+13.72+13.86\n            = 338.24\n            Mean = 338.24/24 = 14.09333\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-23: \n            Values: \n            00:13.65, 01:13.93, 02:11.19, 03:11.54, 04:13.30, 05:11.33, 06:9.57, 07:12.24, 08:13.01, 09:11.96, 10:12.10, 11:12.24, \n            12:8.37, 13:10.62, 14:11.47, 15:11.26, 16:11.19, 17:10.83, 18:11.33, 19:11.47, 20:10.97, 21:7.18, 22:6.96, 23:6.89\n\n            Sum = 13.65+13.93+11.19+11.54+13.30+11.33+9.57+12.24+13.01+11.96+12.10+12.24+8.37+10.62+11.47+11.26+11.19+10.83+11.33+11.47+10.97+7.18+6.96+6.89\n            = 242.4\n            Mean = 242.4/24 = 10.1\n\n        Day2: 2017-09-24:\n            Values:\n            00:6.26, 01:7.74, 02:7.74, 03:9.00, 04:9.57, 05:10.48, 06:10.62, 07:9.43, 08:10.55, 09:8.09, 10:7.67, 11:7.74, \n            12:8.58, 13:10.20, 14:10.90, 15:11.40, 16:11.54, 17:11.19, 18:11.12, 19:11.40, 20:11.82, 21:12.24, 22:12.66, 23:12.73\n\n            Sum = 6.26+7.74+7.74+9.00+9.57+10.48+10.62+9.43+10.55+8.09+7.67+7.74+8.58+10.20+10.90+11.40+11.54+11.19+11.12+11.40+11.82+12.24+12.66+12.73\n            = 230.27\n            Mean = 230.27/24 = 9.594583\n\n        Day3: 2017-09-25:\n            Values:\n            00:13.09, 01:12.73, 02:12.59, 03:12.73, 04:12.45, 05:12.94, 06:12.66, 07:12.45, 08:13.16, 09:13.09, 10:13.58, 11:14.49, \n            12:15.69, 13:16.18, 14:16.25, 15:16.18, 16:16.04, 17:16.74, 18:15.90, 19:15.76, 20:16.32, 21:15.69, 22:15.13, 23:15.69\n\n            Sum = 13.09+12.73+12.59+12.73+12.45+12.94+12.66+12.45+13.16+13.09+13.58+14.49+15.69+16.18+16.25+16.18+16.04+16.74+15.90+15.76+16.32+15.69+15.13+15.69\n            = 347.31\n            Mean = 347.31/24 = 14.47125\n\n     The daily means: [14.09333, 10.1, 9.594583, 14.47125]\n\n     There is a dip on day1 and day2 (weekend) and then a rise on day3 (Monday). \n\n     We are forecasting the next 4 days: Tuesday (2017-09-26), Wednesday (2017-09-27), Thursday (2017-09-28), Friday (2017-09-29).\n\n     We might expect a pattern similar to the previous Monday and Friday? \n\n     However, without more data, we can assume that the daily mean will be around the level of the last day (Monday) or a little higher? \n     But note: the problem does not provide context about the trend. \n\n     Since we don't have a clear trend, we can assume the daily mean for the next 4 days will be the same as the last day (14.47) or the average of the last two weekdays? \n     The last Friday (day0) was 14.09 and Monday (day3) was 14.47. We can take the average of these two: (14.09+14.47)/2 = 14.28.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the last day (Monday) as the base and then adjust by the average of the deviations.\n\n 23. We decide to use the daily mean of the last day (Monday, 14.47) for the next 4 days? But that might ignore a possible increasing trend? \n     The two weekdays (Friday and Monday) show an increase from 14.09 to 14.47 (0.38 in 3 days). If we assume a linear trend, then per day: 0.38/3 = 0.1267 per day.\n\n     Then for the next days:\n        Day4 (Tuesday): 14.47 + 0.1267 = 14.5967\n        Day5 (Wednesday): 14.5967 + 0.1267 = 14.7234\n        Day6 (Thursday): 14.7234 + 0.1267 = 14.8501\n        Day7 (Friday): 14.8501 + 0.1267 = 14.9768\n\n 24. Now, we compute the hourly deviations:\n\n        For each hour (0-23), we compute:\n          deviation(h) = [ (value(0,h) - mean0) + (value(1,h) - mean1) + (value(2,h) - mean2) + (value(3,h) - mean3) ] / 4\n\n        But note: the pattern might be different on weekdays and weekends? We only have one Friday, one Saturday, one Sunday, one Monday.\n\n        We can instead use only the weekdays (Friday and Monday) for the hourly pattern? because the next days are weekdays.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify, but we use all data to get a more robust deviation.\n\n     Let's compute the deviations using all 4 days:\n\n        Hour0: \n            Day0: 12.17 - 14.09333 = -1.92333\n            Day1: 13.65 - 10.1 = 3.55\n            Day2: 6.26 - 9.594583 = -3.334583\n            Day3: 13.09 - 14.47125 = -1.38125\n            Average = (-1.92333 + 3.55 -3.334583 -1.38125)/4 = (-2.089163)/4 = -0.52229075\n\n        Similarly, we do for all 24.\n\n     But note: the deviations on the weekend (day1 and day2) are very different. We might get a pattern that is not representative for weekdays.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use only the two weekdays (Friday and Monday) to compute the deviations:\n\n        Hour0: (12.17 - 14.09333 + 13.09 - 14.47125)/2 = (-1.92333 -1.38125)/2 = -3.30458/2 = -1.65229\n\n        Then the forecast for Tuesday (day4) at hour0: 14.5967 + (-1.65229) = 12.94441\n\n     We do this for all 24.\n\n 25. We choose to use only the two weekdays (Friday and Monday) for the deviations because the next days are weekdays.\n\n     Steps for each hour h in 0..23:\n\n        Let Fri_h = value at day0, hour h\n        Let Mon_h = value at day3, hour h\n\n        deviation_h = [ (Fri_h - mean0) + (Mon_h - mean3) ] / 2\n\n        Then for day d in [4,5,6,7] (which are Tuesday to Friday) and hour h:\n\n            forecast = mean_d + deviation_h\n\n        where mean_d = 14.47 + 0.1267 * (d-3)   [since day3 is Monday, then day4 is Tuesday, which is 1 day after Monday]\n\n        Actually, we computed:\n            day4: 14.5967\n            day5: 14.7234\n            day6: 14.8501\n            day7: 14.9768\n\n 26. But note: the linear trend we computed was from Friday (day0) to Monday (day3): 3 days -> 0.38 increase, so per day 0.1267.\n\n     Then for Tuesday (day4, which is 1 day after Monday): 14.47 + 0.1267 = 14.5967\n        Wednesday (day5): 14.47 + 0.1267*2 = 14.7234\n        Thursday (day6): 14.47 + 0.1267*3 = 14.8501\n        Friday (day7): 14.47 + 0.1267*4 = 14.9768\n\n 27. Now, we compute the deviation for each hour h from 0 to 23 using Friday and Monday:\n\n        mean0 = 14.09333\n        mean3 = 14.47125\n\n        For h=0:\n            Fri: 12.17, deviation0_fri = 12.17 - 14.09333 = -1.92333\n            Mon: 13.09, deviation0_mon = 13.09 - 14.47125 = -1.38125\n            deviation0 = (-1.92333 -1.38125)/2 = -1.65229\n\n        For h=1:\n            Fri: 11.889, deviation1_fri = 11.889 - 14.09333 = -2.20433\n            Mon: 12.73, deviation1_mon = 12.73 - 14.47125 = -1.74125\n            deviation1 = (-2.20433 -1.74125)/2 = -1.97279\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 28. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 29. Then, the forecast for Tuesday (2017-09-26) at hour0: 14.5967 + (-1.65229) = 12.94441\n        hour1: 14.5967 + (-1.97279) = 12.62391\n\n 30. We must generate 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n 31. However, note: the last provided point is 2017-09-25 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00, 2017-09-26 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We'll compute the deviations for each day and hour.\n\n 33. But note: the deviation pattern is fixed per hour? So for the same hour in different days of the forecast, we use the same deviation? \n        But we adjust the daily mean.\n\n 34. Therefore, for a given day d (4,5,6,7) and hour h (0..23):\n\n        forecast = (14.47 + 0.1267 * (d-3)) + deviation_h\n\n 35. We must compute the deviations for h in 0..23.\n\n 36.

Now, we generate the forecast:\n\n        Day4 (Tuesday, 2017-09-26):\n            h0: 14.5967 + (-1.65229) = 12.94441\n            h1: 14.5967 + (-1.97279) = 12.62391\n            h2: 14.5967 + (-1.58579) = 13.01091\n            h3: 14.5967 + (-1.62129) = 12.97541\n            h4: 14.5967 + (-1.65579) = 12.94091\n            h5: 14.5967 + (-1.19979) = 13.39691\n            h6: 14.5967 + (-1.23429) = 13.36241\n            h7: 14.5967 + (-1.16329) = 13.43341\n            h8: 14.5967 + (-0.70279) = 13.89391\n            h9: 14.5967 + (-0.24529) = 14.35141\n            h10: 14.5967 + 0.31621 = 14.91291\n            h11: 14.5967 + 0.56021 = 15.15691\n            h12: 14.5967 + 1.44171 = 16.03841\n            h13: 14.5967 + 1.9682095 = 16.5649095\n            h14: 14.5967 + 1.96771 = 16.56441\n            h15: 14.5967 + 1.51071 = 16.10741\n            h16: 14.5967 + 1.40571 = 16.00241\n            h17: 14.5967 + 1.54471 = 16.14141\n            h18: 14.5967 + 0.87821 = 15.47491\n            h19: 14.5967 + 0.52671 = 15.12341\n            h20: 14.5967 + 0.59571 = 15.19241\n            h21: 14.5967 + 0.14021 = 14.73691\n            h22: 14.5967 + 0.14171 = 14.73841\n            h23: 14.5967 + 0.49171 = 15.08841\n\n        Day5 (Wednesday, 2017-09-27):\n            h0: 14.7234 + (-1.65229) = 13.07111\n            h1: 14.7234 + (-1.97279) = 12.75061\n            ... and so on.\n\n        Similarly for day6 and day7.\n\n 38. We round to 3 decimal places as in the original data.\n\n 39. However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places, but we see that the values are sometimes integers? \n     But we'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 40. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-26 00:00:00, then 2017-09-26 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-29 23:00:00.\n\n 41. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 42. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values? We are generating a complete forecast. So we output 96 complete points.\n\n 43. We must be cautious: this is a simple method and might not be as accurate as a proper time series model, but given the constraints, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 44. Let's code the forecast for 4 days.\n\n 45. We'll create a list for the next 96 points.\n\n 46. Steps:\n\n        daily_means_forecast = [14.5967, 14.7234, 14.8501, 14.9768]   # for day4,5,6,7\n\n        deviations = [-1.65229, -1.97279, -1.58579, -1.62129, -1.65579, -1.19979, -1.23429, -1.16329, -0.70279, -0.24529, \n                      0.31621, 0.56021, 1.44171, 1.9682095, 1.96771, 1.51071, 1.40571, 1.54471, 0.87821, 0.52671, \n                      0.59571, 0.14021, 0.14171, 0.49171]\n\n        Then for day_index in range(4):   # 0 for Tuesday, 1 for Wednesday, 2 for Thursday, 3 for Friday\n            for hour in range(24):\n                value = daily_means_forecast[day_index] + deviations[hour]\n                # round to 3 decimals\n                value = round(value, 3)\n\n        And the date: \n            Start: 2017-09-26 00:00:00\n            Then 2017-09-26 01:00:00 ... until 2017-09-26 23:00:00 -> then 2017-09-27 00:00:00, etc.\n\n 47. We generate the dates using a loop.\n\n 48. We output the data in the same format as the input.\n\n 49. We must note: the original data had the date as index? But we output as two columns: date and OT.\n\n 50. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 51. However, note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we must output 96 lines.\n\n 52. Let's do it.\n\n 53. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta   [But we cannot use in text, so we do manually]\n\n        Start: 2017-09-25 23:00:00 is the last point. The next point is 2017-09-26 00:00:00.\n\n        We can generate:\n\n            base = datetime(2017, 9, 26, 0, 0, 0)\n            then add i hours for i in range(0, 96)\n\n        But we are in text, so we can write:\n\n            day0: 2017-09-26\n            day1: 2017-09-27\n            day2: 2017-09-28\n            day3: 2017-09-29\n\n        and for each day, 24 hours.\n\n 54. We output:\n\n        2017-09-26 00:00:00 <value>\n        2017-09-26 01:00:00 <value>\n        ...\n\n 55. We compute the values as described.\n\n 56. We'll write the code in our mind and output the table.\n\n 57. Due to the length, we only show the first few and the last few? But the problem requires complete data.\n\n 58. We must output all 96.\n\n 59. We'll generate the values and then format.\n\n 60. We note: the deviations for h13 and h14 have more decimals? We used 1.9682095 and 1.96771. We'll use the computed value and then round the final result.\n\n 61. We do the calculation for each point.\n\n 62. We'll create the output in a markdown code block as per the format.\n\n 63. Example for Tuesday (day0 in forecast, which is 2017-09-26) at 00:00:00: 14.5967 - 1.65229 = 12.94441 -> 12.944\n\n 64. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n 65. We do the entire 96 points.\n\n 66. Due to the length, we write a program in our mind and then output the table.\n\n 67. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 68. Note: The problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we output all 96.\n\n 69. We start:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n               date        OT\n2017-09-26 00:00:00 12.944\n2017-09-26 01:00:00 12.624\n2017-09-26 02:00:00 13.011\n2017-09-26 03:00:00 12.975\n2017-09-26 04:00:00 12.941\n2017-09-26 05:00:00 13.397\n2017-09-26 06:00:00 13.362\n2017-09-26 07:00:00 13.433\n2017-09-26 08:00:00 13.894\n2017-09-26 09:00:00 14.351\n2017-09-26 10:00:00 14.913\n2017-09-26 11:00:00 15.157\n2017-09-26 12:00:00 16.038\n2017-09-26 13:00:00 16.565\n2017-09-26 14:00:00 16.564\n2017-09-26 15:00:00 16.107\n2017-09-26 16:00:00 16.002\n2017-09-26 17:00:00 16.141\n2017-09-26 18:00:00 15.475\n2017-09-26 19:00:00 15.123\n2017-09-26 20:00:00 15.192\n2017-09-26 21:00:00 14.737\n2017-09-26 22:00:00 14.738\n2017-09-26 23:00:00 15.088\n2017-09-27 00:00:00 13.071\n2017-09-27 01:00:00 12.751\n2017-09-27 02:00:00 13.138\n2017-09-27 03:00:00 13.102\n2017-09-27 04:00:00 13.068\n2017-09-27 05:00:00 13.524\n2017-09-27 06:00:00 13.489\n2017-09-27 07:00:00 13.560\n2017-09-27 08:00:00 14.021\n2017-09-27 09:00:00 14.478\n2017-09-27 10:00:00 15.040\n2017-09-27 11:00:00 15.284\n2017-09-27 12:00:00 16.165\n2017-09-27 13:00:00 16.692\n2017-09-27 14:00:00 16.691\n2017-09-27 15:00:00 16.234\n2017-09-27 16:00:00 16.129\n2017-09-27 17:00:00 16.268\n2017-09-27 18:00:00 15.602\n2017-09-27 19:00:00 15.250\n2017-09-27 20:00:00 15.319\n2017-09-27 21:00:00 14.864\n2017-09-27 22:00:00 14.865\n2017-09-27 23:00:00 15.215\n2017-09-28 00:00:00 13.198\n2017-09-28 01:00:00 12.878\n2017-09-28 02:00:00 13.265\n2017-09-28 03:00:00 13.229\n2017-09-28 04:00:00 13.195\n2017-09-28 05:00:00 13.651\n2017-09-28 06:00:00 13.616\n2017-09-28 07:00:00 13.687\n2017-09-28 08:00:00 14.147\n2017-09-28 09:00:00 14.605\n2017-09-28 10:00:00 15.167\n2017-09-28 11:00:00 15.411\n2017-09-28 12:00:00 16.292\n2017-09-28 13:00:00 16.818\n2017-09-28 14:00:00 16.818\n2017-09-28 15:00:00 16.361\n2017-09-28 16:00:00 16.256\n2017-09-28 17:00:00 16.395\n2017-09-28 18:00:00 15.729\n2017-09-28 19:00:00 15.377\n2017-09-28 20:00:00 15.446\n2017-09-28 21:00:00 14.991\n2017-09-28 22:00:00 14.992\n2017-09-28 23:00:00 15.342\n2017-09-29 00:00:00 13.325\n2017-09-29 01:00:00 13.005\n2017-09-29 02:00:00 13.392\n2017-09-29 03:00:00 13.356\n2017-09-29 04:00:00 13.322\n2017-09-29 05:00:00 13.778\n2017-09-29 06:00:00 13.743\n2017-09-29 07:00:00 13.814\n2017-09-29 08:00:00 14.274\n2017-09-29 09:00:00 14.732\n2017-09-29 10:00:00 15.294\n2017-09-29 11:00:00 15.538\n2017-09-29 12:00:00 16.419\n2017-09-29 13:00:00 16.945\n2017-09-29 14:00:00 16.945\n2017-09-29 15:00:00 16.488\n2017-09-29 16:00:00 16.383\n2017-09-29 17:00:00 16.522\n2017-09-29 18:00:00 15.856\n2017-09-29 19:00:00 15.504\n2017-09-29 20:00:00 15.573\n2017-09-29 21:00:00 15.118\n2017-09-29 22:00:00 15.119\n2017-09-29 23:00:00 15.469\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 70.
