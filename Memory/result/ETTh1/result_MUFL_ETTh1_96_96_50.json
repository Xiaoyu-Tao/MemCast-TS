        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any gap? \n    However, the user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not show any missing value? \n    We must be cautious. Since the user says \"be aware of that\", we should consider that the provided data might have missing values? \n    But looking at the data, we have 24 hours for 2017-01-17, 24 for 2017-01-18, 24 for 2017-01-19, and 24 for 2017-01-20 -> total 96.\n\n 2. However, the data on 2017-01-20 has a very low value (even negative) at 09:00:00 (-4.015) and 10:00:00 (-5.828) etc. \n    This might be an anomaly or missing value? But the user says the data has missing values. We are not told to impute the past, but to forecast the future.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model. Given the data has 4-day pattern? \n    We have 4 days of data. We might see daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 4. We are to provide the next 96 points. We must generate the timestamps from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We can use a model that handles seasonality. Since we only have 96 points, we cannot use very complex models.\n    - We can use a simple seasonal model like Seasonal Naive, or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality, or even a simple ARIMA with seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note the data on 2017-01-20 has a significant drop (negative values) which might be an anomaly. \n    We have to decide whether to include that in the model or not? But the user says the data has missing values, so perhaps these negative values are actually missing? \n    But the user did not specify which values are missing. We are only given the data as is.\n\n 7. Since the task is to forecast, we must use the entire provided data. We will treat the provided data as is.\n\n 8. We choose a model: \n    Given the seasonality of 24 hours, we can use a seasonal naive model: \n        y_{t+1} = y_{t-23}   (because 24 steps back, so t-23 would be same hour the previous day? Actually, for the first hour of the next day, we use the first hour of the last day? \n        But note: we have 4 days. We can use the last day (day 4) to forecast the next day? But what if we want to use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? \n\n    However, the data on the last day (2017-01-20) has an anomaly. So using the last day might not be the best.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) or SARIMA.\n\n 10. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the seasonality (24), we can try to fit a SARIMA model. But note: the seasonality is 24, and we have 4 seasons (4 days). \n     This is a bit short for a seasonal model. \n\n 11. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the available days (4 days) to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be the same pattern repeated. \n\n 12. Considering the constraints, we must provide 96 points, we can do:\n\n     Option 1: Seasonal Naive using the last available season (day 4) for the next day? But the last day has an anomaly. \n        We see that the last day (2017-01-20) has a dip during 9:00 to 15:00? That might be an anomaly. \n\n     Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. \n\n     Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (8.742 + 9.381 + 9.204 + 7.462) / 4 = (8.742+9.381=18.123; 18.123+9.204=27.327; 27.327+7.462=34.789) -> 8.69725\n        hour1: (9.417 + 8.351 + 10.518 + 7.178) / 4 = (9.417+8.351=17.768; 17.768+10.518=28.286; 28.286+7.178=35.464) -> 8.866\n\n     But note: the data on 2017-01-20 is very different. This might pull the average for that hour.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the anomaly? But we don't know if the anomaly is only in the last day? \n\n 14. Since we are not given any context about the anomaly, we have to make a decision.\n\n 15. We note that the user says the data has missing values. The negative values might be the missing values? \n     But in the provided data, they are given as negative numbers. We cannot change the past data. \n\n 16. For forecasting, we can use a model that is robust to some anomalies? \n\n 17. Given the time and simplicity, we can use the median of the same hour over the 4 days for each hour of the day.\n\n     Steps for median:\n        For hour 0: [8.742, 9.381, 9.204, 7.462] -> sort: [7.462, 8.742, 9.204, 9.381] -> median = (8.742+9.204)/2 = 8.973\n        For hour 1: [9.417, 8.351, 10.518, 7.178] -> sort: [7.178, 8.351, 9.417, 10.518] -> median = (8.351+9.417)/2 = 8.884\n\n     But note: we have 4 days, so we can take the median of the 4.\n\n 18. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) would be the same 24-hour median pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 19. However, is that reasonable? The data shows a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days, so we don't know about weekly. \n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-20) as the forecast? But that day has an anomaly. \n\n 21. Another idea: use the average of the first three days and ignore the last day? Because the last day has an anomaly? \n     But the user did not say to ignore any data.\n\n 22. We must use the entire data. \n\n 23. Considering the above, I propose to use the median of the same hour over the 4 days to form a typical day, and then repeat that typical day 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n 24. Steps:\n     - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n     - For each hour, compute the median of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n     - Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we assign the median value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 25. This will give us a forecast that is the median pattern of the past 4 days, repeated.\n\n 26. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     hour0: [8.742, 9.381, 9.204, 7.462] -> sorted: [7.462, 8.742, 9.204, 9.381] -> median = (8.742+9.204)/2 = 8.973\n     hour1: [9.417, 8.351, 10.518, 7.178] -> sorted: [7.178, 8.351, 9.417, 10.518] -> median = (8.351+9.417)/2 = 8.884\n     hour2: [7.853, 7.498, 8.919, 6.610] -> sorted: [6.610, 7.498, 7.853, 8.919] -> median = (7.498+7.853)/2 = 7.6755\n     hour3: [9.132, 7.214, 8.813, 5.863] -> sorted: [5.863, 7.214, 8.813, 9.132] -> median = (7.214+8.813)/2 = 8.0135\n     hour4: [8.493, 7.676, 7.818, 6.148] -> sorted: [6.148, 7.676, 7.818, 8.493] -> median = (7.676+7.818)/2 = 7.747\n     hour5: [8.422, 7.782, 9.132, 6.219] -> sorted: [6.219, 7.782, 8.422, 9.132] -> median = (7.782+8.422)/2 = 8.102\n     hour6: [8.884, 7.107, 8.919, 5.899] -> sorted: [5.899, 7.107, 8.884, 8.919] -> median = (7.107+8.884)/2 = 7.9955\n     hour7: [11.407, 8.671, 8.884, 6.538] -> sorted: [6.538, 8.671, 8.884, 11.407] -> median = (8.671+8.884)/2 = 8.7775\n     hour8: [11.122, 9.488, 10.767, 8.280] -> sorted: [8.280, 9.488, 10.767, 11.122] -> median = (9.488+10.767)/2 = 10.1275\n     hour9: [10.767, 7.249, 9.168, 0.107] -> sorted: [0.107, 7.249, 9.168, 10.767] -> median = (7.249+9.168)/2 = 8.2085\n     hour10: [5.934, 7.000, 6.467, -4.015] -> sorted: [-4.015, 5.934, 6.467, 7.000] -> median = (5.934+6.467)/2 = 6.2005\n     hour11: [6.787, 7.782, 7.036, -5.828] -> sorted: [-5.828, 6.787, 7.036, 7.782] -> median = (6.787+7.036)/2 = 6.9115\n     hour12: [5.970, 7.356, 5.543, -7.889] -> sorted: [-7.889, 5.543, 5.970, 7.356] -> median = (5.543+5.970)/2 = 5.7565\n     hour13: [5.295, 7.178, 5.224, -7.711] -> sorted: [-7.711, 5.224, 5.295, 7.178] -> median = (5.224+5.295)/2 = 5.2595\n     hour14: [5.153, 7.036, 5.899, -6.112] -> sorted: [-6.112, 5.153, 5.899, 7.036] -> median = (5.153+5.899)/2 = 5.526\n     hour15: [5.330, 7.569, 7.036, -3.909] -> sorted: [-3.909, 5.330, 7.036, 7.569] -> median = (5.330+7.036)/2 = 6.183\n     hour16: [6.219, 7.676, 8.066, 1.848] -> sorted: [1.848, 6.219, 7.676, 8.066] -> median = (6.219+7.676)/2 = 6.9475\n     hour17: [7.818, 8.706, 8.244, 5.863] -> sorted: [5.863, 7.818, 8.244, 8.706] -> median = (7.818+8.244)/2 = 8.031\n     hour18: [7.569, 8.280, 8.066, 8.244] -> sorted: [7.569, 8.066, 8.244, 8.280] -> median = (8.066+8.244)/2 = 8.155\n     hour19: [9.061, 8.777, 9.168, 10.518] -> sorted: [8.777, 9.061, 9.168, 10.518] -> median = (9.061+9.168)/2 = 9.1145\n     hour20: [8.777, 8.955, 9.488, 10.874] -> sorted: [8.777, 8.955, 9.488, 10.874] -> median = (8.955+9.488)/2 = 9.2215\n     hour21: [8.493, 8.884, 9.168, 10.874] -> sorted: [8.493, 8.884, 9.168, 10.874] -> median = (8.884+9.168)/2 = 9.026\n     hour22: [8.599, 10.092, 8.742, 12.473] -> sorted: [8.599, 8.742, 10.092, 12.473] -> median = (8.742+10.092)/2 = 9.417\n     hour23: [8.351, 9.452, 7.924, 10.554] -> sorted: [7.924, 8.351, 9.452, 10.554] -> median = (8.351+9.452)/2 = 8.9015\n\n 27. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 2017-01-24 23:00:00) will be:\n\n     Day1 (2017-01-21): \n        00:00:00 -> 8.973\n        01:00:00 -> 8.884\n        02:00:00 -> 7.6755\n        ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n     Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n 28. However, note that the last day (2017-01-20) had an anomaly, but by using the median we have reduced its impact (only one of the four).\n\n 29. We must generate 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-01-21 00:00:00, then 2017-01-21 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-01-24 23:00:00.\n\n 30. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-21 00:00:00  8.973\n2017-01-21 01:00:00  8.884\n2017-01-21 02:00:00  7.6755\n... (all 96 lines)\n        </answer>\n\n 31. But note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places? \n\n 32. Let's round the medians to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: 8.973 -> 8.973\n        hour1: 8.884 -> 8.884\n        hour2: 7.6755 -> 7.676\n        ... \n\n     We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 33. Rounded medians:\n\n        hour0: 8.973\n        hour1: 8.884\n        hour2: 7.6755 -> 7.676\n        hour3: 8.0135 -> 8.014\n        hour4: 7.747 -> 7.747\n        hour5: 8.102 -> 8.102\n        hour6: 7.9955 -> 7.996\n        hour7: 8.7775 -> 8.778\n        hour8: 10.1275 -> 10.128\n        hour9: 8.2085 -> 8.209\n        hour10: 6.2005 -> 6.201\n        hour11: 6.9115 -> 6.912\n        hour12: 5.7565 -> 5.757\n        hour13: 5.2595 -> 5.260\n        hour14: 5.526 -> 5.526\n        hour15: 6.183 -> 6.183\n        hour16: 6.9475 -> 6.948\n        hour17: 8.031 -> 8.031\n        hour18: 8.155 -> 8.155\n        hour19: 9.1145 -> 9.115\n        hour20: 9.2215 -> 9.222\n        hour21: 9.026 -> 9.026\n        hour22: 9.417 -> 9.417\n        hour23: 8.9015 -> 8.902\n\n 34. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-21 00:00:00 to 23:00:00: [8.973, 8.884, 7.676, 8.014, 7.747, 8.102, 7.996, 8.778, 10.128, 8.209, 6.201, 6.912, 5.757, 5.260, 5.526, 6.183, 6.948, 8.031, 8.155, 9.115, 9.222, 9.026, 9.417, 8.902]\n        Day2: 2017-01-22: same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2017-01-23: same\n        Day4: 2017-01-24: same\n\n 35. We generate the data accordingly.\n\n 36. Write the answer in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models, but given the data size and the anomaly, this is a robust approach.\n",
