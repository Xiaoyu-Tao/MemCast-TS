        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2016-11-14 00:00:00 to 2016-11-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n\n However, note that the data might have missing values. In the provided data, we have 96 consecutive hours without any missing entries? \n But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided sample there are no missing values. \n So, we assume that the provided 96 points are complete, but we must be cautious for the forecasting.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we need a model that can handle multi-step forecasting.\n\n Approach:\n 1. We can use a time series model that can capture daily seasonality (since we have hourly data, seasonality period = 24).\n 2. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use models like:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (24 points) repeated for the next 4 days? But note: the last season is from 2016-11-17 00:00 to 23:00.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n    - ARIMA/SARIMA: but with only 96 points, fitting a SARIMA model might be challenging and we have to be cautious of overfitting.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. \n But for forecasting, we are to produce 96 values without any missing.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the requirement for a complete output, and the fact that we are only given 4 days of history, \n we can use a model that captures the daily pattern and the trend.\n\n Let's observe the data: \n   - There is a clear daily pattern: the load is higher during the night (around 00:00 to early morning) and then drops during the day, and then rises again in the evening? \n     But looking at the data, the highest values are at 00:00, 01:00, ... and then drop and then rise again at 23:00? \n   - Also, there might be a slight trend? But only 4 days, so we can assume the pattern is stable.\n\n Since we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours) and we have exactly 4 days of history, we can use a seasonal naive approach: \n each day in the future is similar to the same hour of the last day (i.e., 2016-11-17) but adjusted by the overall trend? \n\n However, note that the last day (2016-11-17) has a pattern that is similar to the previous days? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the same pattern from the last day (2016-11-17) for the next 4 days? But that would be too simplistic.\n\n Another idea: use the average of each hour over the 4 days? \n\n Let me compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n   Hour_00: (10.717 + 13.061 + 11.119 + 13.396) / 4 = (10.717+13.061=23.778; 23.778+11.119=34.897; 34.897+13.396=48.293) -> 48.293/4 = 12.07325\n   Hour_01: (9.578 + 13.530 + 12.592 + 13.865) / 4 = (9.578+13.530=23.108; 23.108+12.592=35.7; 35.7+13.865=49.565) -> 12.39125\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's see the average of each day:\n\n   Day1 (2016-11-14): average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n   Day2: ...\n   Day3: ...\n   Day4: ...\n\n We can compute:\n\n   Day1: \n        10.717, 9.578, 11.119 -> let me compute quickly: \n        I'll do a rough: \n        The numbers: \n          10.717,9.578,9.511,10.315,10.114,8.908,10.65,11.922,10.114,7.502,8.439,9.042,6.43,6.966,7.1,6.095,6.899,8.038,7.435,7.167,6.43,7.435,7.77,11.119\n        Sum = 10.717+9.578+9.511+10.315+10.114+8.908+10.65+11.922+10.114+7.502+8.439+9.042+6.43+6.966+7.1+6.095+6.899+8.038+7.435+7.167+6.43+7.435+7.77+11.119\n        = 10.717+9.578=20.295; +9.511=29.806; +10.315=40.121; +10.114=50.235; +8.908=59.143; +10.65=69.793; +11.922=81.715; +10.114=91.829; \n        +7.502=99.331; +8.439=107.77; +9.042=116.812; +6.43=123.242; +6.966=130.208; +7.1=137.308; +6.095=143.403; +6.899=150.302; +8.038=158.34; \n        +7.435=165.775; +7.167=172.942; +6.43=179.372; +7.435=186.807; +7.77=194.577; +11.119=205.696\n        Average Day1 = 205.696 / 24 = 8.570666...\n\n   Day2: \n        Start: 13.061,13.530, ... until 12.458\n        I'll compute: \n        13.061,13.530,11.922,13.262,13.597,12.324,13.597,14.468,9.444,9.511,7.837,9.243,6.028,7.1,7.167,7.301,6.832,8.239,7.502,7.167,6.564,7.234,7.1,12.458\n        Sum = 13.061+13.53=26.591; +11.922=38.513; +13.262=51.775; +13.597=65.372; +12.324=77.696; +13.597=91.293; +14.468=105.761; +9.444=115.205; \n        +9.511=124.716; +7.837=132.553; +9.243=141.796; +6.028=147.824; +7.1=154.924; +7.167=162.091; +7.301=169.392; +6.832=176.224; +8.239=184.463; \n        +7.502=191.965; +7.167=199.132; +6.564=205.696; +7.234=212.93; +7.1=220.03; +12.458=232.488\n        Average Day2 = 232.488 / 24 = 9.687\n\n   Day3: \n        11.119,12.592,13.128,10.851,9.578,10.516,12.592,9.846,9.176,6.899,8.841,9.109,5.827,6.43,6.229,6.497,6.899,9.176,7.904,6.899,6.162,5.425,7.368,10.985\n        Sum = 11.119+12.592=23.711; +13.128=36.839; +10.851=47.69; +9.578=57.268; +10.516=67.784; +12.592=80.376; +9.846=90.222; +9.176=99.398; \n        +6.899=106.297; +8.841=115.138; +9.109=124.247; +5.827=130.074; +6.43=136.504; +6.229=142.733; +6.497=149.23; +6.899=156.129; +9.176=165.305; \n        +7.904=173.209; +6.899=180.108; +6.162=186.27; +5.425=191.695; +7.368=199.063; +10.985=210.048\n        Average Day3 = 210.048 / 24 = 8.752\n\n   Day4: \n        13.396,13.865,12.927,13.061,13.463,12.86,13.329,14.2,9.578,8.439,10.114,9.98,7.301,7.167,7.636,7.904,7.904,8.038,7.167,6.296,5.626,4.89,6.229,8.774\n        Sum = 13.396+13.865=27.261; +12.927=40.188; +13.061=53.249; +13.463=66.712; +12.86=79.572; +13.329=92.901; +14.2=107.101; +9.578=116.679; \n        +8.439=125.118; +10.114=135.232; +9.98=145.212; +7.301=152.513; +7.167=159.68; +7.636=167.316; +7.904=175.22; +7.904=183.124; +8.038=191.162; \n        +7.167=198.329; +6.296=204.625; +5.626=210.251; +4.89=215.141; +6.229=221.37; +8.774=230.144\n        Average Day4 = 230.144 / 24 = 9.589333...\n\n The daily averages: 8.57, 9.69, 8.75, 9.59 -> no clear trend? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that uses the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we are safe to use the 4 days.\n\n However, the problem requires forecasting 96 points. We can do:\n\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days, and then use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n But that would be a constant pattern for each day? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-17) as the pattern and then adjust by the overall level? \n\n Since we don't see a clear trend, and the data is short, I propose:\n\n   We use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to form a typical day, and then use that typical day for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Group by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n   Step 2: Repeat that typical day 4 times (for 2016-11-18 to 2016-11-21).\n\n But note: the last day (2016-11-17) has a pattern that is more recent? Maybe we should use only the last day? \n\n However, using the average of 4 days might be more robust.\n\n Let me compute the typical day:\n\n   Hour 0: (10.717 + 13.061 + 11.119 + 13.396) / 4 = 12.07325\n   Hour 1: (9.578 + 13.530 + 12.592 + 13.865) / 4 = 12.39125\n   Hour 2: (9.511 + 11.922 + 13.128 + 12.927) / 4 = 11.872\n   Hour 3: (10.315 + 13.262 + 10.851 + 13.061) / 4 = 11.87225\n   Hour 4: (10.114 + 13.597 + 9.578 + 13.463) / 4 = 11.688\n   Hour 5: (8.908 + 12.324 + 10.516 + 12.86) / 4 = 11.152\n   Hour 6: (10.65 + 13.597 + 12.592 + 13.329) / 4 = 12.542\n   Hour 7: (11.922 + 14.468 + 9.846 + 14.2) / 4 = 12.609\n   Hour 8: (10.114 + 9.444 + 9.176 + 9.578) / 4 = 9.578\n   Hour 9: (7.502 + 9.511 + 6.899 + 8.439) / 4 = 8.08775\n   Hour 10: (8.439 + 7.837 + 8.841 + 10.114) / 4 = 8.80775\n   Hour 11: (9.042 + 9.243 + 9.109 + 9.98) / 4 = 9.3435\n   Hour 12: (6.43 + 6.028 + 5.827 + 7.301) / 4 = 6.3965\n   Hour 13: (6.966 + 7.1 + 6.43 + 7.167) / 4 = 6.91575\n   Hour 14: (7.1 + 7.167 + 6.229 + 7.636) / 4 = 7.033\n   Hour 15: (6.095 + 7.301 + 6.497 + 7.904) / 4 = 6.94925\n   Hour 16: (6.899 + 6.832 + 6.899 + 7.904) / 4 = 7.1335\n   Hour 17: (8.038 + 8.239 + 9.176 + 8.038) / 4 = 8.37275\n   Hour 18: (7.435 + 7.502 + 7.904 + 7.167) / 4 = 7.502\n   Hour 19: (7.167 + 7.167 + 6.899 + 6.296) / 4 = 6.88225\n   Hour 20: (6.43 + 6.564 + 6.162 + 5.626) / 4 = 6.1955\n   Hour 21: (7.435 + 7.234 + 5.425 + 4.89) / 4 = 6.246\n   Hour 22: (7.77 + 7.1 + 7.368 + 6.229) / 4 = 7.11675\n   Hour 23: (11.119 + 12.458 + 10.985 + 8.774) / 4 = 10.834\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2016-11-18 to 2016-11-21), we assign:\n\n   2016-11-18 00:00:00 -> 12.07325\n   2016-11-18 01:00:00 -> 12.39125\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not encountered in the provided data. \n However, for the future data we are to produce, we are not missing any? We are generating 96 points.\n\n However, the problem says: \"But please note that these data will have missing values, so be aware of that.\" \n This might refer to the provided data? But in the provided data we have 96 points without missing. \n\n So, we'll output the 96 points as described.\n\n But let me check: the last provided point is 2016-11-17 23:00:00 -> 8.774\n Then the next 96 points start at 2016-11-18 00:00:00 and end at 2016-11-21 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   Day1: 2016-11-18: [12.07325, 12.39125, 11.872, 10.834] (24 values)\n   Day2: 2016-11-19: same 24 values\n   Day3: 2016-11-20: same 24 values\n   Day4: 2016-11-21: same 24 values\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the dataset is subdivided into four mini-datasets, with data sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes\". \n But here we are given hourly, so we output hourly.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", and we have 96 hourly points. \n However, is this the best method? \n   - The average might smooth out the pattern? But we have only 4 days, so it's acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the last day (2016-11-17) as the pattern? \n   Then we would repeat the last day (2016-11-17) 4 times? \n\n   But the last day: \n        00:00: 13.396\n        01:00: 13.865\n        ... \n        23:00: 8.774\n\n   Then the next 4 days would be:\n\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00: 13.396\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00: 13.865\n        ... and so on.\n\n   But the problem says the data might have missing values? We don't have any in the last day? \n\n   However, the last day (2016-11-17) has a pattern that is different from the previous days? \n   For example, the average of the last day is 9.59, which is higher than the first day (8.57) but similar to the second day (9.69). \n\n   But without a clear trend, repeating the last day might be a good choice? \n\n   But note: the problem says \"High UseFul Load\", and we are to predict the next 4 days. \n\n   Since we are not given any information about the future (like holidays, etc.), we assume the pattern is stable.\n\n   I think the average of the 4 days is more robust because it reduces the noise.\n\n   However, let me see the last day (2016-11-17) at hour 21:00: 4.89, which is the lowest of all 4 days at that hour? \n   So if we use the last day, we are predicting a very low value at 21:00? But the average for 21:00 is 6.246, which is higher.\n\n   The average method might be better.\n\n   We'll go with the average method.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we don't have any in the provided data. \n   we are just using the average of the available points per hour.\n\n   We output the 96 points as the typical day repeated 4 times.\n\n Format: \n        date, HUFL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00, 12.073\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00, 12.391\n        ... \n\n   We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Let me write the typical day with rounding:\n\n   Hour0: 12.073\n   Hour1: 12.391\n   Hour2: 11.872\n   Hour3: 11.872\n   Hour4: 11.688\n   Hour5: 11.152\n   Hour6: 12.542\n   Hour7: 12.609\n   Hour8: 9.578\n   Hour9: 8.088\n   Hour10: 8.808\n   Hour11: 9.344\n   Hour12: 6.397\n   Hour13: 6.916\n   Hour14: 7.033\n   Hour15: 6.949\n   Hour16: 7.134\n   Hour17: 8.373\n   Hour18: 7.502\n   Hour19: 6.882\n   Hour20: 6.196\n   Hour21: 6.246\n   Hour22: 7.117\n   Hour23: 10.834\n\n Then we repeat this 4 times.\n\n We must output the dates correctly:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-18 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-18 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-18 23:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-19 00:00:00 ... until 2016-11-19 23:00:00\n   ... until 2016-11-21 23:00:00\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n   from 2016-11-18 00:00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00:00, hourly.\n\n We can use pandas to generate, but since we are in text, we do:\n\n   Day 18: 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00 -> 24\n   Day 19: 24\n   Day 20: 24\n   Day 21: 24\n\n Total 96.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   2016-11-18 00:00:00,12.073\n   2016-11-18 01:00:00,12.391\n   ...\n\n But note: the input has the date format as \"2016-11-14 00:00:00\", so we follow.\n\n However, the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll output 96 lines.\n\n Let me write the typical day array:\n\n   typical = [12.073, 12.391, 11.872, 11.872, 11.688, 11.152, 12.542, 12.609, 9.578, 8.088, 8.808, 9.344, 6.397, 6.916, 7.033, 6.949, 7.134, 8.373, 7.502, 6.882, 6.196, 6.246, 7.117, 10.834]\n\n Then for each day in the next 4 days, we output the typical array.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-11-18 00:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-18 01:00:00, ... until 2016-11-18 23:00:00\n   Then 2016-11-19 00:00:00 ... \n\n We can do:\n\n   dates = []\n   for day in range(18, 22): # 18,19,20,21\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date_str = f\"2016-11-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            # but note: day 18,19,20,21\n\n   But note: November has 30 days, so 18,19,20,21 are all valid.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the next day after 2016-11-17 is 2016-11-18.\n\n Let me write the dates:\n\n   Day1: 2016-11-18\n   Day2: 2016-11-19\n   Day3: 2016-11-20\n   Day4: 2016-11-21\n\n We'll output:\n\n   for i in range(0, 96):\n        date = start_date + i * timedelta(hours=1)\n\n   start_date = datetime(2016,11,18,0,0,0)\n\n But we are in text, we can do:\n\n   base_date = \"2016-11-\"\n   days = [18,19,20,21]\n\n   for day in days:\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date_str = base_date + str(day).zfill(2) + \" \" + str(hour).zfill(2) + \":00:00\"\n\n But note: the hour should be two digits: 00,01,...,23.\n\n However, the problem says the data is hourly, so we use the same as input.\n\n We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only given HUFL? \n And we are only forecasting HUFL.\n\n We output only the date and HUFL.\n\n Format:\n\n        date   HUFL\n        ... \n\n We must output in the same format as the input? The input has:\n\n        2016-11-14 00:00:00 10.717\n\n But we are to output:\n\n        <answer>\n        date   HUFL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 12.073\n        ... \n\n But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n We are to output the next 96 dates and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        date   HUFL\n        2016-11-18 00:00:00 12.073\n        2016-11-18 01:00:00 12.391\n        ... \n        2016-11-21 23:00:00 10.834\n\n But note: the input has the HUFL value with 3 decimal places?
