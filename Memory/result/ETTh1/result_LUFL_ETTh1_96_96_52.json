        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2017-01-25 00:00:00 to 2017-01-28 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might be harder to capture).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, the forecast should be robust to missingness, but since we are only given complete data, we proceed.\n 3. We will use a time series model that can capture seasonality. Given the hourly data and the clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or a simple seasonal naive approach.\n - However, the data shows a repeating pattern but with some variation. We note that the load is higher during the evening and lower at night.\n\n Since we are only required to forecast the next 96 points and we have exactly 4 days of history (96 hours), we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal Naive Forecast\n   - We use the last day (24 hours) and repeat it 4 times? But note: the last day is 2017-01-28 (Saturday) and the next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. \n   - However, we don't have multiple weeks of data to capture weekly seasonality. We only have 4 consecutive days (Wednesday to Saturday). \n\n Option 2: Use the average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day to form a 24-hour profile and then repeat it 4 days? But note: the pattern might be different on weekdays vs weekends.\n\n Looking at the data:\n   - 2017-01-25: Wednesday\n   - 2017-01-26: Thursday\n   - 2017-01-27: Friday\n   - 2017-01-28: Saturday\n\n The next 4 days: \n   - 2017-01-29: Sunday\n   - 2017-01-30: Monday\n   - 2017-01-31: Tuesday\n   - 2017-02-01: Wednesday\n\n We note that the weekend pattern (Saturday and Sunday) might be different from weekdays.\n\n However, we only have one Saturday (2017-01-28) and no Sunday in the history. So we have to be cautious.\n\n Given the constraints, we can do:\n   - For the first day (Sunday, 2017-01-29): we don't have a Sunday in the history. We can use the average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n     But note: the Saturday (2017-01-28) might be lower than weekdays? We see that on 2017-01-28 (Saturday) the values are generally lower than the previous days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n     - For the next day (Sunday): we can use the pattern from the most recent day (Saturday) but adjusted? Or use the average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n However, without more data, we have to make a simple model.\n\n Let's try to compute the average for each hour over the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days? But that would ignore the weekly pattern.\n\n Another idea: use the last week same day? But we don't have a Sunday from the previous week.\n\n Considering the above, and the fact that we are limited to 4 days, we decide to use:\n\n   - For the first 24 hours (Sunday, 2017-01-29): use the values from the previous Saturday (2017-01-28) because Sunday might be similar to Saturday? \n     But note: we don't have data to support that. Alternatively, we can use the last available Saturday and then for the next days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) we use the corresponding days from the previous week (i.e., 2017-01-25 was Wednesday, 2017-01-26 Thursday, 2017-01-27 Friday, and 2017-01-28 Saturday). \n\n   - So for:\n        Sunday (2017-01-29): use the Saturday (2017-01-28) pattern.\n        Monday (2017-01-30): use the Monday? But we don't have Monday. We have only Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. \n        So for Monday, we can use the average of the weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) for each hour? But note that Friday might have a different pattern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n        Sunday: 2017-01-28 (Saturday) values\n        Monday: 2017-01-25 (Wednesday) values? because we don't have Monday. But that might not be accurate.\n\n Given the complexity and the lack of data, we decide to use a simple method: use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n   - Compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n Example for hour 00:00: \n   (2.284 + 2.315 + 2.376 + 3.472) / 4 = (2.284, 2.315, 2.376, 3.472) -> let's calculate:\n        2.284 + 2.315 = 4.599\n        +2.376 = 6.975\n        +3.472 = 10.447\n        /4 = 2.61175\n\n Then we use 2.612 (rounded to 3 decimals) for the 00:00 of each of the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the next 4 are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. They might have different levels. However, without more data, this is a simple approach.\n\n However, we note that the Saturday (2017-01-28) had a higher value at 00:00 (3.472) than the previous days. So the average is pulled up.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of outliers? But 4 points is too few.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (Saturday) for Sunday, then for Monday we use the previous Wednesday? But we don't know if that is consistent.\n\n Given the instructions and the simplicity, we'll go with the average per hour.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? However, the provided data does not have missing values.\n\n We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n   hour0: (2.284, 2.315, 2.376, 3.472) -> 2.61175 -> 2.612\n   hour1: (1.949, 1.949, 1.919, 2.711) -> (1.949+1.949+1.919+2.711)/4 = 8.528/4 = 2.132\n   hour2: (1.706, 1.706, 1.645, 2.132) -> (1.706+1.706+1.645+2.132)/4 = 7.189/4 = 1.79725 -> 1.797\n   hour3: (1.614, 1.614, 1.523, 1.949) -> (1.614+1.614+1.523+1.949)/4 = 6.7/4 = 1.675\n   hour4: (1.584, 1.553, 1.492, 1.919) -> (1.584+1.553+1.492+1.919)/4 = 6.548/4 = 1.637\n   hour5: (1.736, 1.706, 1.553, 1.980) -> (1.736+1.706+1.553+1.980)/4 = 6.975/4 = 1.74375 -> 1.744\n   hour6: (1.980, 2.041, 1.919, 2.284) -> (1.980+2.041+1.919+2.284)/4 = 8.224/4 = 2.056\n   hour7: (2.619, 2.589, 2.559, 2.772) -> (2.619+2.589+2.559+2.772)/4 = 10.539/4 = 2.63475 -> 2.635\n   hour8: (3.015, 3.259, 3.503, 3.503) -> (3.015+3.259+3.503+3.503)/4 = 13.28/4 = 3.32\n   hour9: (2.680, 2.680, 3.381, 2.833) -> (2.680+2.680+3.381+2.833)/4 = 11.574/4 = 2.8935 -> 2.894\n   hour10: (2.376, 2.467, 3.137, 2.711) -> (2.376+2.467+3.137+2.711)/4 = 10.691/4 = 2.67275 -> 2.673\n   hour11: (3.015, 2.833, 3.320, 2.985) -> (3.015+2.833+3.320+2.985)/4 = 12.153/4 = 3.03825 -> 3.038\n   hour12: (2.528, 2.589, 3.350, 2.589) -> (2.528+2.589+3.350+2.589)/4 = 11.056/4 = 2.764\n   hour13: (2.102, 2.163, 3.320, 2.102) -> (2.102+2.163+3.320+2.102)/4 = 9.687/4 = 2.42175 -> 2.422\n   hour14: (2.071, 2.071, 3.137, 2.041) -> (2.071+2.071+3.137+2.041)/4 = 9.32/4 = 2.33\n   hour15: (2.071, 2.102, 3.229, 2.193) -> (2.071+2.102+3.229+2.193)/4 = 9.595/4 = 2.39875 -> 2.399\n   hour16: (2.284, 2.345, 3.259, 2.071) -> (2.284+2.345+3.259+2.071)/4 = 9.959/4 = 2.48975 -> 2.490\n   hour17: (3.015, 3.290, 3.350, 2.528) -> (3.015+3.290+3.350+2.528)/4 = 12.183/4 = 3.04575 -> 3.046\n   hour18: (3.411, 3.564, 3.868, 3.015) -> (3.411+3.564+3.868+3.015)/4 = 13.858/4 = 3.4645 -> 3.465\n   hour19: (3.990, 4.112, 4.447, 3.594) -> (3.990+4.112+4.447+3.594)/4 = 16.143/4 = 4.03575 -> 4.036\n   hour20: (4.356, 4.508, 4.691, 3.777) -> (4.356+4.508+4.691+3.777)/4 = 17.332/4 = 4.333\n   hour21: (4.173, 4.386, 4.630, 3.564) -> (4.173+4.386+4.630+3.564)/4 = 16.753/4 = 4.18825 -> 4.188\n   hour22: (3.564, 3.838, 4.356, 3.320) -> (3.564+3.838+4.356+3.320)/4 = 15.078/4 = 3.7695 -> 3.770\n   hour23: (2.955, 2.985, 3.960, 2.863) -> (2.955+2.985+3.960+2.863)/4 = 12.763/4 = 3.19075 -> 3.191\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours) we repeat this 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the average pattern might smooth out the daily variation and also ignore the weekly pattern. However, it is a simple and robust method.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a more sophisticated model, but with only 4 days, it's hard to train.\n\n We decide to output the next 96 hours by repeating the computed average for each hour for 4 days.\n\n Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n   Day 1: 2017-01-29 (Sunday) 00:00 to 23:00: use the 24 averages in order.\n   Day 2: 2017-01-30 (Monday): same 24 averages.\n   Day 3: 2017-01-31 (Tuesday): same 24 averages.\n   Day 4: 2017-02-01 (Wednesday): same 24 averages.\n\n However, note that the average pattern is computed from 4 days that include both weekdays and a Saturday. So it might be a blend.\n\n But without more data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-29 00:00:00 -> 2.612\n          2017-01-29 01:00:00 -> 2.132\n          ... until 23:00:00 -> 3.191\n\n   Then 2017-01-30 00:00:00 -> 2.612\n        and so on.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   The last date in the input is 2017-01-28 23:00:00.\n   Then:\n        2017-01-29 00:00:00\n        2017-01-29 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-01-29 23:00:00\n        2017-01-30 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-02-01 23:00:00\n\n We have 4*24=96 records.\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n Let's list the 24 average values we computed:\n\n   hour0: 2.612\n   hour1: 2.132\n   hour2: 1.797\n   hour3: 1.675\n   hour4: 1.637\n   hour5: 1.744\n   hour6: 2.056\n   hour7: 2.635\n   hour8: 3.320\n   hour9: 2.894\n   hour10: 2.673\n   hour11: 3.038\n   hour12: 2.764\n   hour13: 2.422\n   hour14: 2.330\n   hour15: 2.399\n   hour16: 2.490\n   hour17: 3.046\n   hour18: 3.465\n   hour19: 4.036\n   hour20: 4.333\n   hour21: 4.188\n   hour22: 3.770\n   hour23: 3.191\n\n Now, we write the next 96 records by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 records without missing.\n\n We output in the same format: two columns: date and LUFL.\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-01-29 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 2017-01-29 23:00:00, then 2017-01-30 00:00:00, ... until 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the dates and then assign the corresponding hour value.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We have a list of 24 values: [2.612, 2.132, 1.797, 1.675, 1.637, 1.744, 2.056, 2.635, 3.320, 2.894, 2.673, 3.038, 2.764, 2.422, 2.330, 2.399, 2.490, 3.046, 3.465, 4.036, 4.333, 4.188, 3.770, 3.191]\n\n   Then for each day in the next 4 days, we assign these 24 values in order.\n\n We write the output in the required format.\n\n Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-29 00:00:00 2.612\n2017-01-29 01:00:00 2.132\n2017-01-29 02:00:00 1.797\n2017-01-29 03:00:00 1.675\n2017-01-29 04:00:00 1.637\n2017-01-29 05:00:00 1.744\n2017-01-29 06:00:00 2.056\n2017-01-29 07:00:00 2.635\n2017-01-29 08:00:00 3.320\n2017-01-29 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-01-29 10:00:00 2.673\n2017-01-29 11:00:00 3.038\n2017-01-29 12:00:00 2.764\n2017-01-29 13:00:00 2.422\n2017-01-29 14:00:00 2.330\n2017-01-29 15:00:00 2.399\n2017-01-29 16:00:00 2.490\n2017-01-29 17:00:00 3.046\n2017-01-29 18:00:00 3.465\n2017-01-29 19:00:00 4.036\n2017-01-29 20:00:00 4.333\n2017-01-29 21:00:00 4.188\n2017-01-29 22:00:00 3.770\n2017-01-29 23:00:00 3.191\n2017-01-30 00:00:00 2.612\n2017-01-30 01:00:00 2.132\n2017-01-30 02:00:00 1.797\n2017-01-30 03:00:00 1.675\n2017-01-30 04:00:00 1.637\n2017-01-30 05:00:00 1.744\n2017-01-30 06:00:00 2.056\n2017-01-30 07:00:00 2.635\n2017-01-30 08:00:00 3.320\n2017-01-30 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-01-30 10:00:00 2.673\n2017-01-30 11:00:00 3.038\n2017-01-30 12:00:00 2.764\n2017-01-30 13:00:00 2.422\n2017-01-30 14:00:00 2.330\n2017-01-30 15:00:00 2.399\n2017-01-30 16:00:00 2.490\n2017-01-30 17:00:00 3.046\n2017-01-30 18:00:00 3.465\n2017-01-30 19:00:00 4.036\n2017-01-30 20:00:00 4.333\n2017-01-30 21:00:00 4.188\n2017-01-30 22:00:00 3.770\n2017-01-30 23:00:00 3.191\n2017-01-31 00:00:00 2.612\n2017-01-31 01:00:00 2.132\n2017-01-31 02:00:00 1.797\n2017-01-31 03:00:00 1.675\n2017-01-31 04:00:00 1.637\n2017-01-31 05:00:00 1.744\n2017-01-31 06:00:00 2.056\n2017-01-31 07:00:00 2.635\n2017-01-31 08:00:00 3.320\n2017-01-31 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-01-31 10:00:00 2.673\n2017-01-31 11:00:00 3.038\n2017-01-31 12:00:00 2.764\n2017-01-31 13:00:00 2.422\n2017-01-31 14:00:00 2.330\n2017-01-31 15:00:00 2.399\n2017-01-31 16:00:00 2.490\n2017-01-31 17:00:00 3.046\n2017-01-31 18:00:00 3.465\n2017-01-31 19:00:00 4.036\n2017-01-31 20:00:00 4.333\n2017-01-31 21:00:00 4.188\n2017-01-31 22:00:00 3.770\n2017-01-31 23:00:00 3.191\n2017-02-01 00:00:00 2.612\n2017-02-01 01:00:00 2.132\n2017-02-01 02:00:00 1.797\n2017-02-01 03:00:00 1.675\n2017-02-01 04:00:00 1.637\n2017-02-01 05:00:00 1.744\n2017-02-01 06:00:00 2.056\n2017-02-01 07:00:00 2.635\n2017-02-01 08:00:00 3.320\n2017-02-01 09:00:00 2.894\n2017-02-01 10:00:00 2.673\n2017-02-01 11:00:00 3.038\n2017-02-01 12:00:00 2.764\n2017-02-01 13:00:00 2.422\n2017-02-01 14:00:00 2.330\n2017-02-01 15:00:00 2.399\n2017-02-01 16:00:00 2.490\n2017-02-01 17:00:00 3.046\n2017-02-01 18:00:00 3.465\n2017-02-01 19:00:00 4.036\n2017-02-01 20:00:00 4.333\n2017-02-01 21:00:00 4.188\n2017-02-01 22:00:00 3.770\n2017-02-01 23:00:00 3.191\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n However, note: the average we computed for hour0 (00:00) was 2.61175 -> rounded to 2.612, but we must be consistent with the input which has 3 decimal places.\n\n We did the same for all.\n\n This is a simple and effective method for very short-term forecasting with limited data.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
