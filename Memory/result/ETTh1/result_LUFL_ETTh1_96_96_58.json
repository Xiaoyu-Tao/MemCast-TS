        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for LUFL (Low UseFul Load) from 2017-02-18 00:00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). We can observe that the load is higher during certain hours (like 6-7 AM) and lower at night.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of data, we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small amount of data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days ahead, we can use a simple seasonal model.\n\n 4. We consider the following:\n    - The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points. But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided data for the past 96 is complete. For forecasting, we assume the model we build can handle the pattern.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal naive method, which uses the last available season (i.e., the previous day) as the forecast. However, we have 4 days of data and we see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. Alternatively, we can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n    Let's break the data into 4 days (each day 24 hours). We have:\n        Day1: 2017-02-18 (index 0-23)\n        Day2: 2017-02-19 (index 24-47)\n        Day3: 2017-02-20 (index 48-71)\n        Day4: 2017-02-21 (index 72-95)\n\n    For forecasting the next day (2017-02-22) at hour 0 (00:00:00), we can take the average of the same hour (00:00) of the past 4 days? But note: the data for 2017-02-21 00:00:00 is 1.888, 2017-02-20 00:00:00 is 4.386, 2017-02-19 00:00:00 is 2.071, and 2017-02-18 00:00:00 is 4.508. The average is (1.888+4.386+2.071+4.508)/4 = 3.21325.\n\n    However, we see that the first two days (18th and 19th) are weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and the next two (20th and 21st) are weekdays (Monday and Tuesday). But we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality. Also, the pattern on weekdays might be different from weekends. But we only have 4 days and the next 4 days would be Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday? (2017-02-22 is Wednesday, 23 Thursday, 24 Friday, 25 Saturday). So we have a mix.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last day (Tuesday) as a base and adjust with the average daily pattern? But without more data, it's challenging.\n\n 6. Considering the constraints, we can use a moving average over the same hour of the last 4 days. But note that the data on 2017-02-20 and 2017-02-21 (weekdays) are more similar to each other than to the weekend days. So we might weight the weekdays more? However, we don't have enough data to separate.\n\n 7. Another approach: use Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (ETS) or ARIMA with seasonal components. But we are limited to 96 points and we need to forecast 96 points. We can use a simple model: the average of the same hour over the available days.\n\n    We'll compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days we have. Then, we use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day. However, we note that the next 4 days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. The weekend day (Saturday) might be different. But we don't have a Saturday in the training? We have one Saturday (2017-02-18) and one Sunday (2017-02-19). We have two weekdays (Monday and Tuesday). \n\n    We can do:\n        For the next 3 weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri) we use the average of the two weekdays (Monday and Tuesday) for the same hour?\n        For Saturday (the 4th day of the forecast, 2017-02-25) we use the Saturday (2017-02-18) and Sunday (2017-02-19) as reference? But Sunday might be different.\n\n    However, the problem does not specify the day of the week effect and we have very limited data.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we must provide a forecast, we choose a simple method: use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days for each hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days (from 2017-02-22 to 2017-02-25) will be:\n            forecast_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n    But note: this will give the same value for the same hour in each of the next 4 days.\n\n    However, we see that the data has a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day1: average = (4.508+4.356+...+2.041)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n            Day1: 4.508 (0) ... 2.041 (23) -> average around (let's calculate a few: 4.5,4.3,4.2,4.0,3.9,4.4,5.0,5.2,3.1,2.7,2.5,3.2,2.4,2.1,1.9,2.0,2.4,2.9,3.1,3.2,3.0,2.6,2.3,2.0) -> sum ~ 75.5, average ~ 3.15\n        Day2: 2.071,2.041,...,2.894 -> average ~ (2.0+2.0+1.7+1.5+1.5+1.8+2.2+2.4+2.8+3.2+2.9+3.4+2.5+2.8+2.6+2.1+2.6+2.5+2.7+2.8+3.0+2.5+2.9+2.9) -> sum ~ 60, average ~ 2.5\n        Day3: 4.386,4.386,...,1.980 -> average: (4.3+4.3+4.0+4.1+4.1+4.3+4.3+5.3+2.4+2.1+2.3+3.0+2.5+2.4+2.8+2.3+3.3+3.6+3.4+3.1+2.8+2.3+1.9+1.9) -> sum ~ 70, average ~ 2.9\n        Day4: 1.888,1.492,...,1.949 -> average: (1.8+1.4+1.4+1.5+1.3+1.7+2.0+3.0+3.3+3.1+3.1+3.6+2.6+2.4+2.6+2.1+2.4+3.2+3.1+2.8+2.6+2.3+2.0+1.9) -> sum ~ 60, average ~ 2.5\n\n    The level is changing. The average of the entire 96 points is about (75.5+60+70+60)/96 = 265.5/96 ~ 2.76.\n\n    The average method per hour would ignore the trend. We see a drop from day1 to day2, then a rise on day3 and then again drop on day4? It's not clear.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: use the last day (day4) as the forecast for the next day? Then for the next 4 days, we use the same as the last 4 days? But that would be repeating the last 4 days. However, the problem asks for 96 points (4 days) and we have 4 days of history. We can repeat the last 4 days? But that would be 4 days of the same pattern as the last 4 days?\n\n    But note: the last 4 days are: 2017-02-18 (Saturday), 2017-02-19 (Sunday), 2017-02-20 (Monday), 2017-02-21 (Tuesday). The next 4 days are: 2017-02-22 (Wednesday), 2017-02-23 (Thursday), 2017-02-24 (Friday), 2017-02-25 (Saturday). So the days of the week do not align.\n\n    We can use the last day (Tuesday) for Wednesday, then Sunday for Thursday? That doesn't make sense.\n\n10. Given the complexity and the lack of data, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days. This will at least capture the daily pattern and smooth out the day-to-day variations.\n\n    We compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of the 4 days.\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this average pattern 4 times? But that would be the same for each day. However, we note that the problem does not to omit any content and we must provide 96 numbers.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average pattern and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? But that might be too arbitrary.\n\n11. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0: (4.508 + 2.071 + 4.386 + 1.888) / 4 = (4.508+2.071=6.579; 6.579+4.386=10.965; 10.965+1.888=12.853) -> 12.853/4 = 3.21325\n    Hour 1: (4.356+2.041+4.386+1.492)/4 = (4.356+2.041=6.397; 6.397+4.386=10.783; 10.783+1.492=12.275) -> 12.275/4 = 3.06875\n    Hour 2: (4.234+1.706+4.082+1.462)/4 = (4.234+1.706=5.94; 5.94+4.082=10.022; 10.022+1.462=11.484) -> 11.484/4 = 2.871\n    Hour 3: (4.082+1.492+4.142+1.584)/4 = (4.082+1.492=5.574; 5.574+4.142=9.716; 9.716+1.584=11.3) -> 11.3/4 = 2.825\n    Hour 4: (3.960+1.553+4.142+1.310)/4 = (3.960+1.553=5.513; 5.513+4.142=9.655; 9.655+1.310=10.965) -> 10.965/4 = 2.74125\n    Hour 5: (4.417+1.828+4.325+1.706)/4 = (4.417+1.828=6.245; 6.245+4.325=10.57; 10.57+1.706=12.276) -> 12.276/4 = 3.069\n    Hour 6: (5.056+2.224+4.386+2.041)/4 = (5.056+2.224=7.28; 7.28+4.386=11.666; 11.666+2.041=13.707) -> 13.707/4 = 3.42675\n    Hour 7: (5.239+2.467+5.391+3.076)/4 = (5.239+2.467=7.706; 7.706+5.391=13.097; 13.097+3.076=16.173) -> 16.173/4 = 4.04325\n    Hour 8: (3.137+2.802+2.406+3.350)/4 = (3.137+2.802=5.939; 5.939+2.406=8.345; 8.345+3.350=11.695) -> 11.695/4 = 2.92375\n    Hour 9: (2.711+3.259+2.102+3.137)/4 = (2.711+3.259=5.97; 5.97+2.102=8.072; 8.072+3.137=11.209) -> 11.209/4 = 2.80225\n    Hour 10: (2.528+2.955+2.345+3.137)/4 = (2.528+2.955=5.483; 5.483+2.345=7.828; 7.828+3.137=10.965) -> 10.965/4 = 2.74125\n    Hour 11: (3.259+3.411+3.076+3.655)/4 = (3.259+3.411=6.67; 6.67+3.076=9.746; 9.746+3.655=13.401) -> 13.401/4 = 3.35025\n    Hour 12: (2.467+2.528+2.589+2.680)/4 = (2.467+2.528=4.995; 4.995+2.589=7.584; 7.584+2.680=10.264) -> 10.264/4 = 2.566\n    Hour 13: (2.132+2.894+2.437+2.437)/4 = (2.132+2.894=5.026; 5.026+2.437=7.463; 7.463+2.437=9.9) -> 9.9/4 = 2.475\n    Hour 14: (1.980+2.680+2.863+2.680)/4 = (1.980+2.680=4.66; 4.66+2.863=7.523; 7.523+2.680=10.203) -> 10.203/4 = 2.55075\n    Hour 15: (2.071+2.132+2.315+2.132)/4 = (2.071+2.132=4.203; 4.203+2.315=6.518; 6.518+2.132=8.65) -> 8.65/4 = 2.1625\n    Hour 16: (2.437+2.619+3.381+2.467)/4 = (2.437+2.619=5.056; 5.056+3.381=8.437; 8.437+2.467=10.904) -> 10.904/4 = 2.726\n    Hour 17: (2.955+2.528+3.625+3.229)/4 = (2.955+2.528=5.483; 5.483+3.625=9.108; 9.108+3.229=12.337) -> 12.337/4 = 3.08425\n    Hour 18: (3.107+2.772+3.411+3.107)/4 = (3.107+2.772=5.879; 5.879+3.411=9.29; 9.29+3.107=12.397) -> 12.397/4 = 3.09925\n    Hour 19: (3.259+2.863+3.137+2.894)/4 = (3.259+2.863=6.122; 6.122+3.137=9.259; 9.259+2.894=12.153) -> 12.153/4 = 3.03825\n    Hour 20: (3.076+3.076+2.863+2.650)/4 = (3.076+3.076=6.152; 6.152+2.863=9.015; 9.015+2.650=11.665) -> 11.665/4 = 2.91625\n    Hour 21: (2.650+2.589+2.376+2.376)/4 = (2.650+2.589=5.239; 5.239+2.376=7.615; 7.615+2.376=9.991) -> 9.991/4 = 2.49775\n    Hour 22: (2.376+2.955+1.980+2.010)/4 = (2.376+2.955=5.331; 5.331+1.980=7.311; 7.311+2.010=9.321) -> 9.321/4 = 2.33025\n    Hour 23: (2.041+2.894+1.980+1.949)/4 = (2.041+2.894=4.935; 4.935+1.980=6.915; 6.915+1.949=8.864) -> 8.864/4 = 2.216\n\n    Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00) we will have:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-22): [3.21325, 3.06875, 2.871, 2.825, 2.74125, 3.069, 3.42675, 4.04325, 2.92375, 2.80225, 2.74125, 3.35025, 2.566, 2.475, 2.55075, 2.1625, 2.726, 3.08425, 3.09925, 3.03825, 2.91625, 2.49775, 2.33025, 2.216]\n        Day2 (2017-02-23): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-02-24): same as above\n        Day4 (2017-02-25): same as above\n\n    But note: the problem says the data might have missing values?

Let's generate the data:\n\n    We have the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n    h0: (4.508+2.071+4.386+1.888)/4 = 12.853/4 = 3.21325 -> 3.213\n    h1: (4.356+2.041+4.386+1.492)/4 = 12.275/4 = 3.06875 -> 3.069\n    h2: (4.234+1.706+4.082+1.462)/4 = 11.484/4 = 2.871 -> 2.871\n    h3: (4.082+1.492+4.142+1.584)/4 = 11.3/4 = 2.825 -> 2.825\n    h4: (3.960+1.553+4.142+1.310)/4 = 10.965/4 = 2.74125 -> 2.741\n    h5: (4.417+1.828+4.325+1.706)/4 = 12.276/4 = 3.069 -> 3.069\n    h6: (5.056+2.224+4.386+2.041)/4 = 13.707/4 = 3.42675 -> 3.427\n    h7: (5.239+2.467+5.391+3.076)/4 = 16.173/4 = 4.04325 -> 4.043\n    h8: (3.137+2.802+2.406+3.350)/4 = 11.695/4 = 2.92375 -> 2.924\n    h9: (2.711+3.259+2.102+3.137)/4 = 11.209/4 = 2.80225 -> 2.802\n    h10: (2.528+2.955+2.345+3.137)/4 = 10.965/4 = 2.74125 -> 2.741\n    h11: (3.259+3.411+3.076+3.655)/4 = 13.401/4 = 3.35025 -> 3.350\n    h12: (2.467+2.528+2.589+2.680)/4 = 10.264/4 = 2.566 -> 2.566\n    h13: (2.132+2.894+2.437+2.437)/4 = 9.9/4 = 2.475 -> 2.475\n    h14: (1.980+2.680+2.863+2.680)/4 = 10.203/4 = 2.55075 -> 2.551\n    h15: (2.071+2.132+2.315+2.132)/4 = 8.65/4 = 2.1625 -> 2.163\n    h16: (2.437+2.619+3.381+2.467)/4 = 10.904/4 = 2.726 -> 2.726\n    h17: (2.955+2.528+3.625+3.229)/4 = 12.337/4 = 3.08425 -> 3.084\n    h18: (3.107+2.772+3.411+3.107)/4 = 12.397/4 = 3.09925 -> 3.099\n    h19: (3.259+2.863+3.137+2.894)/4 = 12.153/4 = 3.03825 -> 3.038\n    h20: (3.076+3.076+2.863+2.650)/4 = 11.665/4 = 2.91625 -> 2.916\n    h21: (2.650+2.589+2.376+2.376)/4 = 9.991/4 = 2.49775 -> 2.498\n    h22: (2.376+2.955+1.980+2.010)/4 = 9.321/4 = 2.33025 -> 2.330\n    h23: (2.041+2.894+1.980+1.949)/4 = 8.864/4 = 2.216 -> 2.216\n\n    Now, we create 4 days of data by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n    The dates:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-22 00:00:00 to 2017-02-22 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2017-02-23 00:00:00 to 2017-02-23 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2017-02-24 00:00:00 to 2017-02-24 23:00:00\n        Day5: 2017-02-25 00:00:00 to 2017-02-25 23:00:00\n\n    We write the data accordingly.\n\n17. Code to generate the dates and the repeated values:\n\n    We'll write 96 lines.\n\n    For day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n        for hour in [0,1,...,23]:\n            date = 2017-02-22 + day_offset days\n            time = hour:00:00\n            value = the value for that hour (from the list above)\n\n    We note: 2017-02-22 is the next day after 2017-02-21.\n\n18.
