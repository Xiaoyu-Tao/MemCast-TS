        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-02 00:00:00 to 2016-08-05 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-06 00:00:00 to 2016-08-09 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a method. Given the short history (only 96 points) and the need for 96 forecasts, we can use a model that can handle time series with potential seasonality. The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a seasonal model or a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data is from August (summer in the northern hemisphere) and we are forecasting the next 4 days, which is still in August. So we expect similar patterns.\n\n 5. We can use the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and then forecast the seasonally adjusted data, or use a model like Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing State Space Model with Trend and Seasonality).\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA). But with only 96 points, we have to be cautious about overfitting.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, we will use an automated method that can handle seasonality. We can use the `statsmodels` library for this, but since we are in a text-based environment, we will simulate the process.\n\n 8. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed to model.\n\n 9. We are to output the next 96 points. We must generate the dates and the forecasted OT.\n\n 10. Since we cannot run actual code here, we will describe the steps and then provide a simulated forecast. But the problem requires the complete data.\n\n 11. Given the constraints of the problem, we will use a simple approach: \n     - We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24 hours). We can compute the average pattern for the 4 days we have and then adjust by the last known values.\n\n 12. However, a more robust method is to use a model. We'll assume we are using a Holt-Winters model with additive seasonality and a period of 24.\n\n 13. Steps for Holt-Winters:\n     - We fit the model on the 96 points.\n     - We forecast the next 96 points.\n\n 14. But note: without running the code, we cannot provide exact numbers. However, the problem requires an answer.\n\n 15. We must generate the next 96 dates. The last date in the data is 2016-08-05 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n     2016-08-06 00:00:00\n     2016-08-06 01:00:00\n     ...\n     2016-08-09 23:00:00\n\n 16. We will simulate the forecast by:\n     a) Calculating the average hourly pattern over the 4 days (each hour of the day averaged).\n     b) Taking the last day (2016-08-05) and then using the average pattern to adjust for the next days? But that might not capture the trend.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: repeat the last day's pattern for the next 4 days? But the problem says to forecast, and the data might have a trend.\n\n 18. Looking at the data, there is no obvious long-term trend in the 4 days. The values are fluctuating without a clear upward or downward trend. So we can assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 19. We can do:\n     - Calculate the mean for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n     - Then use that mean pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. However, the last day (2016-08-05) might be the most relevant. But to avoid noise, we average.\n\n 21. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (35.666000 + 31.093000 + 31.867001 + 32.852001) / 4 = (35.666+31.093+31.867+32.852)/4 = 32.8695\n     ... and so on for each hour.\n\n 22. But note: the problem says to forecast, and we are not given the ability to compute. We have to provide the data.\n\n 23. Since we cannot compute exactly without the data, we will provide a placeholder that follows the pattern.\n\n 24. However, the problem requires the complete data. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 25. We decide to use the average method. We calculate the average for each hour of the day (0-23) from the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n 26. Steps for generating the forecast:\n     - We have 4 days, so 4 values for each hour (e.g., hour 0 has 4 values: from day1, day2, day3, day4).\n     - We average these 4 values to get the typical value for that hour.\n\n 27. Then for the next 4 days (2016-08-06 to 2016-08-09), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 28. But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but we don't have any in the provided data. So we use all.\n\n 29. We generate the dates and the forecasted OT.\n\n 30. We must output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-06 00:00:00 <value>\n2016-08-06 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2016-08-09 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 31. We will calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (35.666000, 31.093000, 31.867001, 32.852001) -> (35.666+31.093+31.867+32.852)/4 = 32.8695\n     Hour 1: (35.455002, 31.304001, 32.289001, 33.695999) -> (35.455+31.304+32.289+33.696)/4 = 33.18625\n     ... and so on.\n\n 32. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 33. Then we assign:\n\n     2016-08-06 00:00:00 -> average_hour0\n     2016-08-06 01:00:00 -> average_hour1\n     ... until 2016-08-06 23:00:00 -> average_hour23\n\n     and then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n 34. However, note: the problem says \"forecast\", and this is a naive method. But without a model, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 35. We must be cautious: the data might have a trend, but we don't see a clear trend in 4 days. Also, the seasonality is daily.\n\n 36. We compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (35.666000 + 31.093000 + 31.867001 + 32.852001) / 4 = 32.8695005\n     Hour 1: (35.455002 + 31.304001 + 32.289001 + 33.695999) / 4 = (35.455+31.304+32.289+33.696) = 132.744002 / 4 = 33.1860005\n     Hour 2: (35.946999 + 33.556000 + 32.077999 + 33.132999) / 4 = (35.947+33.556+32.078+33.133) = 134.714998 / 4 = 33.6787495\n     Hour 3: (36.088001 + 32.360001 + 32.360001 + 33.766998) / 4 = (36.088+32.360+32.360+33.767) = 134.575 / 4 = 33.64375\n     Hour 4: (35.596001 + 31.023001 + 32.077999 + 34.188999) / 4 = (35.596+31.023+32.078+34.189) = 132.886 / 4 = 33.2215\n     Hour 5: (34.962002 + 32.500000 + 30.952999 + 33.485001) / 4 = (34.962+32.5+30.953+33.485) = 131.9 / 4 = 32.975\n     Hour 6: (34.188999 + 32.640999 + 31.938000 + 33.695999) / 4 = (34.189+32.641+31.938+33.696) = 132.464 / 4 = 33.116\n     Hour 7: (34.891998 + 31.797001 + 32.148998 + 35.876999) / 4 = (34.892+31.797+32.149+35.877) = 134.715 / 4 = 33.67875\n     Hour 8: (36.088001 + 30.389999 + 32.077999 + 35.666000) / 4 = (36.088+30.39+32.078+35.666) = 134.222 / 4 = 33.5555\n     Hour 9: (36.509998 + 30.459999 + 34.188999 + 34.118000) / 4 = (36.51+30.46+34.189+34.118) = 135.277 / 4 = 33.81925\n     Hour 10: (37.214001 + 28.490999 + 35.736000 + 34.048000) / 4 = (37.214+28.491+35.736+34.048) = 135.489 / 4 = 33.87225\n     Hour 11: (38.972000 + 28.983000 + 35.033001 + 35.243999) / 4 = (38.972+28.983+35.033+35.244) = 138.232 / 4 = 34.558\n     Hour 12: (38.902000 + 30.882000 + 33.837002 + 35.596001) / 4 = (38.902+30.882+33.837+35.596) = 139.217 / 4 = 34.80425\n     Hour 13: (39.535000 + 32.500000 + 30.671000 + 34.118000) / 4 = (39.535+32.5+30.671+34.118) = 136.824 / 4 = 34.206\n     Hour 14: (38.972000 + 31.938000 + 31.233999 + 33.556000) / 4 = (38.972+31.938+31.234+33.556) = 135.7 / 4 = 33.925\n     Hour 15: (36.651001 + 31.938000 + 32.570999 + 35.384998) / 4 = (36.651+31.938+32.571+35.385) = 136.545 / 4 = 34.13625\n     Hour 16: (36.439999 + 32.570999 + 34.750999 + 35.806999) / 4 = (36.44+32.571+34.751+35.807) = 139.569 / 4 = 34.89225\n     Hour 17: (32.710999 + 34.328999 + 35.596001 + 34.540001) / 4 = (32.711+34.329+35.596+34.54) = 137.176 / 4 = 34.294\n     Hour 18: (33.556000 + 33.063000 + 36.299000 + 34.188999) / 4 = (33.556+33.063+36.299+34.189) = 137.107 / 4 = 34.27675\n     Hour 19: (34.821999 + 33.132999 + 35.596001 + 34.328999) / 4 = (34.822+33.133+35.596+34.329) = 137.88 / 4 = 34.47\n     Hour 20: (35.384998 + 32.360001 + 33.063000 + 33.203999) / 4 = (35.385+32.36+33.063+33.204) = 134.012 / 4 = 33.503\n     Hour 21: (32.710999 + 30.531000 + 32.640999 + 33.273998) / 4 = (32.711+30.531+32.641+33.274) = 129.157 / 4 = 32.28925\n     Hour 22: (34.750999 + 31.445000 + 33.273998 + 32.640999) / 4 = (34.751+31.445+33.274+32.641) = 132.111 / 4 = 33.02775\n     Hour 23: (33.344002 + 31.445000 + 32.430000 + 33.203999) / 4 = (33.344+31.445+32.43+33.204) = 130.423 / 4 = 32.60575\n\n 37. Now, we assign these averages to the next 4 days in order.\n\n 38. We generate the dates:\n\n     Day 5: 2016-08-06\n     Day 6: 2016-08-07\n     Day 7: 2016-08-08\n     Day 8: 2016-08-09\n\n 39. For each day, we assign the 24 hours in order.\n\n 40. We write the data:\n\n    2016-08-06 00:00:00 32.8695\n    2016-08-06 01:00:00 33.1860\n    2016-08-06 02:00:00 33.6787\n    ... and so on.\n\n 41. We round to 6 decimal places as in the input? The input had 6 decimal places. But note: the input had up to 6, but sometimes less. We'll output 6.\n\n 42. However, note: the input had some with 3 and some with 6. We see the original data had:\n\n       35.666000 -> 6\n       35.455002 -> 6\n\n     So we output 6 decimal places.\n\n 43. But our averages are computed with high precision, so we round to 6 decimals.\n\n 44. We must be cautious: the problem says \"complete data\", so we output 96 lines.\n\n 45. We generate the next 96 points.\n\n 46. We note: the dates are consecutive and hourly.\n\n 47. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 48. Since the calculation is manual and we have 24 averages, we'll repeat the same 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 49. We list the 24 averages (rounded to 6 decimal places):\n\n    hour0: 32.8695005 -> 32.869501\n    hour1: 33.1860005 -> 33.186001\n    hour2: 33.6787495 -> 33.678750\n    hour3: 33.64375   -> 33.643750\n    hour4: 33.2215    -> 33.221500\n    hour5: 32.975     -> 32.975000\n    hour6: 33.116     -> 33.116000\n    hour7: 33.67875   -> 33.678750\n    hour8: 33.5555    -> 33.555500\n    hour9: 33.81925   -> 33.819250\n    hour10: 33.87225  -> 33.872250\n    hour11: 34.558    -> 34.558000\n    hour12: 34.80425  -> 34.804250\n    hour13: 34.206    -> 34.206000\n    hour14: 33.925    -> 33.925000\n    hour15: 34.13625  -> 34.136250\n    hour16: 34.89225  -> 34.892250\n    hour17: 34.294    -> 34.294000\n    hour18: 34.27675  -> 34.276750\n    hour19: 34.47     -> 34.470000\n    hour20: 33.503    -> 33.503000\n    hour21: 32.28925  -> 32.289250\n    hour22: 33.02775  -> 33.027750\n    hour23: 32.60575  -> 32.605750\n\n 50. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n     Day 1: 2016-08-06: hours 0 to 23 -> use the above 24 values in order.\n     Day 2: 2016-08-07: same 24 values.\n     Day 3: 2016-08-08: same 24 values.\n     Day 4: 2016-08-09: same 24 values.\n\n 51.
