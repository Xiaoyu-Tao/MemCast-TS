        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-17 00:00:00 to 2017-08-20 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. \n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input? But the given data is complete.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data shows some daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours),\n    we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the small data (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the last season (24 hours) as the forecast for the next season? But we have 4 days and we see that the pattern is not exactly the same.\n    - However, the data from 2017-08-20 is quite different (much higher values) than the previous days.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing method that can handle seasonality (Holt-Winters) or a simple ARIMA model with seasonal component.\n\n 6. But note: the data on 2017-08-20 shows a significant increase in the values, especially in the afternoon and evening. This might be due to a special event or a change in pattern.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the need for a quick solution, we can use a model that automatically captures trend and seasonality.\n\n 8. We'll use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, which can handle additive or multiplicative seasonality.\n\n 9. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n    - Check for missing values and impute if necessary (here we don't have missing in the given 96, so skip).\n    - Fit an ExponentialSmoothing model with a seasonal period of 24 (hourly data with daily seasonality) and trend and seasonal components.\n    - We choose additive seasonality because the variation seems to be roughly constant over the series? But note the spike on 2017-08-20: multiplicative might be better? \n      However, with only 4 days, it's hard to tell. We'll try additive.\n\n 10. But note: we are not allowed to output code, we must output the forecasted data.\n\n 11. Since we cannot run code here, we have to simulate the process. We can use a simple method: \n      - We observe that the data has a daily pattern: low during the night, then increases during the day, and then decreases again.\n      - The last day (2017-08-20) is significantly higher. We might assume that the next day (2017-08-21) will be similar to 2017-08-20? \n        but then we have to forecast 4 days (96 hours). \n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: use the last 24 hours as the forecast for the next 24 hours, but that would repeat 2017-08-20 for the next 4 days? \n     But the problem is that 2017-08-20 is a Sunday? Let's check: \n        2017-08-17: Thursday? \n        2017-08-18: Friday\n        2017-08-19: Saturday\n        2017-08-20: Sunday\n\n     Then the next day (2017-08-21) is Monday. So we might expect Sunday's pattern for Monday? Probably not.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and without being able to run a model, we have to make a reasonable estimate.\n\n 14. We note that the data from 2017-08-17 to 2017-08-19 are similar in magnitude (ranging from about -0.9 to 5.0) but 2017-08-20 goes up to 8.372. \n     This might be an anomaly? Or a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 15. Considering the challenge, we will use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days? \n     But note: the last day is much higher, so if we average, we might smooth out the spike.\n\n 16. Another idea: use the last day (2017-08-20) as the base and then adjust by the average of the previous days? \n\n 17. We decide to use a weighted average: \n     - For the next 24 hours (2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-21 23:00:00): \n          We take the value of 2017-08-20 (Sunday) and adjust by the difference between Sunday and the previous days? \n     But we don't have a Monday pattern.\n\n 18. Given the ambiguity, we will use a simple method: \n      We calculate the average of each hour over the 4 days we have, and then use that average for each hour for the next 4 days? \n      But that would ignore the upward trend on the last day.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-20) as the forecast for the next day (2017-08-21) and then for the subsequent days, \n      we use the pattern of 2017-08-20 but scaled by the average day-to-day change? \n\n 20. However, the problem requires 96 points (4 days). We can do:\n\n      Day1 (2017-08-21): use the values of 2017-08-20 (the last day) \n      Day2 (2017-08-22): use the values of 2017-08-19? but that was Saturday) \n      We don't have enough history for weekly seasonality.\n\n 21. We decide to use the Exponential Smoothing model conceptually. We assume additive seasonality and trend. We fit a model and then forecast.\n\n 22. Without running the model, we can approximate by:\n\n      - The level and trend from the last few points: \n          The last point: 7.569 at 2017-08-20 23:00:00\n          The point at 22:00:00: 7.167 -> increasing trend at the end.\n\n      - The seasonal component: we have 4 cycles (4 days). We can compute the seasonal indices for each hour.\n\n 23. Steps for manual calculation (simplified):\n\n      a) Calculate the average of each hour across the 4 days (if we had 4 days for each hour). But note: we have 4 days, so 4 values per hour.\n\n      b) De-seasonalize the series by dividing by the seasonal indices (if multiplicative) or subtracting (if additive). We choose additive because the variation seems additive.\n\n      c) Then fit a trend on the de-seasonalized series. \n\n      d) Then forecast the trend and add the seasonal indices.\n\n 24. However, without actual computation, we can approximate the forecast by:\n\n      For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and then add a trend component.\n\n 25. But we see an upward trend? Let's look at the daily average:\n\n        Day1 (2017-08-17): average = (2.143+2.344+...+1.608)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            We see values: min -0.67, max 5.157 -> average around (2.143+2.344+...+1.608)/24 -> we can skip exact calculation.\n\n        Instead, we note the daily average might be increasing? \n\n        We can compute the daily mean:\n\n          2017-08-17: \n            sum = 2.143+2.344+2.344+3.282+2.277+2.143+2.545+3.215+3.215+4.019+5.157+4.019+4.756+4.019+4.220+3.416+2.478+1.072+0.067-0.670+0.000+0.737+1.139+1.608\n            = let's add: \n              2.143+2.344=4.487; +2.344=6.831; +3.282=10.113; +2.277=12.39; +2.143=14.533; +2.545=17.078; +3.215=20.293; +3.215=23.508; +4.019=27.527; +5.157=32.684; \n              +4.019=36.703; +4.756=41.459; +4.019=45.478; +4.220=49.698; +3.416=53.114; +2.478=55.592; +1.072=56.664; +0.067=56.731; -0.670=56.061; +0=56.061; \n              +0.737=56.798; +1.139=57.937; +1.608=59.545\n            average = 59.545/24 \u2248 2.481\n\n          2017-08-18: \n            ... too long, but we can see the values are similar? \n\n          Instead, we note the last day (2017-08-20) has much higher values: \n            at 14:00: 8.372, 15:00:5.894, 16:00:5.492, 17:00:5.827, 18:00:5.224, 19:00:5.090, 20:00:5.626, 21:00:4.488, 22:00:7.167, 23:00:7.569 -> so average will be higher.\n\n        We can compute the daily means:\n\n          Day1: 59.545 -> 2.481\n          Day2: \n            values: 3.282,3.148,2.344,3.014,3.215,2.746,1.875,2.210,2.545,3.684,3.751,3.952,3.416,4.086,3.684,2.478,0.000,0.067,-0.335,0.000,0.335,0.804,1.474,1.407\n            sum = 3.282+3.148=6.43; +2.344=8.774; +3.014=11.788; +3.215=15.003; +2.746=17.749; +1.875=19.624; +2.210=21.834; +2.545=24.379; +3.684=28.063; +3.751=31.814; \n            +3.952=35.766; +3.416=39.182; +4.086=43.268; +3.684=46.952; +2.478=49.43; +0.000=49.43; +0.067=49.497; -0.335=49.162; +0.000=49.162; +0.335=49.497; \n            +0.804=50.301; +1.474=51.775; +1.407=53.182\n            average = 53.182/24 \u2248 2.216\n\n          Day3: \n            values: 2.679,3.349,2.478,2.947,2.679,1.741,1.340,2.009,1.608,2.210,3.483,4.957,2.344,1.741,4.354,1.808,0.469,-0.201,-0.938,-0.536,0.938,1.139,2.478,3.282\n            sum = 2.679+3.349=6.028; +2.478=8.506; +2.947=11.453; + ... \n            We skip the exact, but it seems around 2.0?\n\n          Day4: \n            values: 1.474,0.402,0.938,1.674,1.942,1.474,1.541,3.014,2.947,3.885,3.751,3.952,4.756,4.689,8.372,5.894,5.492,5.827,5.224,5.090,5.626,4.488,7.167,7.569\n            sum = 1.474+0.402=1.876; + ... we see the high values: 8.372,5.894,5.492,5.827,5.224,5.090,5.626,4.488,7.167,7.569 -> so the sum will be high.\n            Let's add the high ones: 8.372+5.894+5.492+5.827+5.224+5.090+5.626+4.488+7.167+7.569 = 61.749, and the first 14 values: \n                1.474+0.402+0.938+1.674+1.942+1.474+1.541+3.014+2.947+3.885+3.751+3.952+4.756+4.689 = 36.437\n            total = 36.437 + 61.749 = 98.186, average = 98.186/24 \u2248 4.091\n\n        The daily averages: [2.481, 2.216, ?, 4.091] -> we don't have the third day exactly, but we see an upward trend on the last day.\n\n 26. Given the time constraint, we must produce a forecast. We decide to use:\n\n     - The seasonal pattern: average of the 4 days for each hour (so we have 24 seasonal indices).\n\n     - Then we adjust by a trend: we see the last day is about 4.091, the day before was about 2.2, and the day before that about 2.5, and the first day 2.5. \n        The trend from day3 to day4 is a big jump. We might assume a linear trend for the next 4 days? \n\n     - We can compute the daily average for the 4 days we have and then fit a linear regression on the daily averages to get the trend per day.\n\n        Days: 1,2,3,4 -> averages: [2.481, 2.216, X, 4.091] -> we don't have day3. We can skip day3? or we computed day3 approximately? \n\n 27. We must complete the forecast. We decide to use the following:\n\n      For each hour h (0 to 23) in the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) we do:\n\n        base = average of the hour h over the 4 days\n        then add a daily trend component.\n\n      How to get the daily trend? We can compute the daily averages for the 4 days we have and then fit a line. But we don't have day3.\n\n      Let's compute day3:\n\n        Day3: 2017-08-19: \n          data: \n            00:2.679,01:3.349,02:2.478,03:2.947,04:2.679,05:1.741,06:1.340,07:2.009,08:1.608,09:2.210,10:3.483,11:4.957,12:2.344,13:1.741,14:4.354,15:1.808,16:0.469,17:-0.201,18:-0.938,19:-0.536,20:0.938,21:1.139,22:2.478,23:3.282\n\n          Let's compute the sum: \n            2.679+3.349=6.028\n            +2.478=8.506\n            +2.947=11.453\n            +2.679=14.132\n            +1.741=15.873\n            +1.340=17.213\n            +2.009=19.222\n            +1.608=20.83\n            +2.210=23.04\n            +3.483=26.523\n            +4.957=31.48\n            +2.344=33.824\n            +1.741=35.565\n            +4.354=39.919\n            +1.808=41.727\n            +0.469=42.196\n            -0.201=41.995\n            -0.938=41.057\n            -0.536=40.521\n            +0.938=41.459\n            +1.139=42.598\n            +2.478=45.076\n            +3.282=48.358\n\n          average = 48.358/24 = 2.015\n\n        So daily averages: \n          day1: 2.481\n          day2: 2.216\n          day3: 2.015\n          day4: 4.091\n\n        Now we fit a linear regression on these 4 points (x= day index: 1,2,3,4; y= [2.481, 2.216, 2.015, 4.091])\n\n        We can compute the slope: \n          x=[1,2,3,4], y=[2.481,2.216,2.015,4.091]\n\n          n=4\n          sum_x = 1+2+3+4 = 10\n          sum_y = 2.481+2.216+2.015+4.091 = 10.803\n          sum_xy = 1*2.481 + 2*2.216 + 3*2.015 + 4*4.091 = 2.481+4.432+6.045+16.364 = 29.322\n          sum_x2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n          b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n            = (4*29.322 - 10*10.803) / (4*30 - 100)\n            = (117.288 - 108.03) / (120 - 100)\n            = 9.258 / 20 = 0.4629\n\n          a = (sum_y - b*sum_x)/n = (10.803 - 0.4629*10)/4 = (10.803-4.629)/4 = 6.174/4 = 1.5435\n\n        So the trend line:\n          y = 0.4629 * x + 1.5435\n\n        For the next 4 days (x=5,6,7,8):\n          day5 (2017-08-21): y5 = 0.4629*5 + 1.5435 = 2.3145 + 1.5435 = 3.858\n          day6: 0.4629*6+1.5435 = 2.7774+1.5435=4.3209\n          day7: 0.4629*7+1.5435=3.2403+1.5435=4.7838\n          day8: 0.4629*8+1.5435=3.7032+1.5435=5.2467\n\n        But note: the jump on day4 was large, and the model is linear, so it will keep increasing.\n\n 28. Now, for each hour in the day, we have a base seasonal value from the average of the 4 days for that hour.\n\n      Let S_h = (value_day1_h + value_day2_h + value_day3_h + value_day4_h) / 4\n\n      Then for a future day d (d=5,6,7,8) and hour h, the forecast is:\n\n          F_{d,h} = S_h + (T_d - T_bar)\n\n          where T_d is the daily average for day d (from the trend: 3.858,4.3209,4.7838,5.2467) and T_bar is the average of the historical daily averages.\n\n      T_bar = (2.481+2.216+2.015+4.091)/4 = 10.803/4 = 2.70075\n\n      So for day5: adjustment = 3.858 - 2.70075 = 1.15725\n          day6: 4.3209 - 2.70075 = 1.62015\n          day7: 4.7838 - 2.70075 = 2.08305\n          day8: 5.2467 - 2.70075 = 2.54595\n\n 29. Now we compute S_h for each hour (0 to 23) by averaging the 4 days for that hour.\n\n      Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        day1: 2.143\n        day2: 3.282\n        day3: 2.679\n        day4: 1.474\n        S_0 = (2.143+3.282+2.679+1.474)/4 = (9.578)/4 = 2.3945\n\n      Then for 2017-08-21 00:00:00 (day5, hour0): \n          F = 2.3945 + 1.15725 = 3.55175\n\n      Similarly, for 2017-08-22 00:00:00 (day6, hour0): \n          F = 2.3945 + 1.62015 = 4.01465\n\n      And so on.\n\n 30. We do this for every hour.\n\n 31. However, note: the data on day4 (2017-08-20) is very high, and we are adding a positive adjustment for the trend, so the forecast will be even higher? \n      But the base S_h is the average of the 4 days, so it's a compromise.\n\n 32. We must generate 96 points. We'll generate the next 4 days (2017-08-21 to 2017-08-24) with 24 hours each.\n\n 33. Steps:\n\n      a) Precompute the 24 seasonal indices (S_h for h=0..23) by averaging the 4 days for that hour.\n\n      b) Precompute the daily adjustments for the next 4 days: [1.15725, 1.62015, 2.08305, 2.54595]\n\n      c) For day5 (2017-08-21) and for hour h in 0..23:\n            date = 2017-08-21 hh:00:00\n            value = S_h + 1.15725\n\n         For day6 (2017-08-22) and hour h:\n            date = 2017-08-22 hh:00:00\n            value = S_h + 1.62015\n\n         For day7 (2017-08-23) and hour h:\n            value = S_h + 2.08305\n\n         For day8 (2017-08-24) and hour h:\n            value = S_h + 2.54595\n\n 34. We must be cautious: the adjustment might make negative values? But the data has negative values. We'll proceed.\n\n 35. Let's do one more example: hour 19 (19:00:00)\n\n        Historical:\n          day1: -0.670\n          day2: 0.000\n          day3: -0.536\n          day4: 5.090\n          S_19 = (-0.670+0.000-0.536+5.090)/4 = (3.884)/4 = 0.971\n\n        Then for day5: 0.971 + 1.15725 = 2.12825\n\n        For day6: 0.971 + 1.62015 = 2.59115\n\n        ...\n\n 36. We'll compute all 24 seasonal indices:\n\n      h0 (00:00): [2.143, 3.282, 2.679, 1.474] -> sum=9.578, avg=2.3945\n      h1 (01:00): [2.344, 3.148, 3.349, 0.402] -> sum=9.243, avg=2.31075\n      h2 (02:00): [2.344, 2.344, 2.478, 0.938] -> sum=8.104, avg=2.026\n      h3 (03:00): [3.282, 3.014, 2.947, 1.674] -> sum=10.917, avg=2.72925\n      h4 (04:00): [2.277, 3.215, 2.679, 1.942] -> sum=10.113, avg=2.52825\n      h5 (05:00): [2.143, 2.746, 1.741, 1.474] -> sum=8.104, avg=2.026\n      h6 (06:00): [2.545, 1.875, 1.340, 1.541] -> sum=7.301, avg=1.82525\n      h7 (07:00): [3.215, 2.210, 2.009, 3.014] -> sum=10.448, avg=2.612\n      h8 (08:00): [3.215, 2.545, 1.608, 2.947] -> sum=10.315, avg=2.57875\n      h9 (09:00): [4.019, 3.684, 2.210, 3.885] -> sum=13.798, avg=3.4495\n      h10 (10:00): [5.157, 3.751, 3.483, 3.751] -> sum=16.142, avg=4.0355\n      h11 (11:00): [4.019, 3.952, 4.957, 3.952] -> sum=16.88, avg=4.22\n      h12 (12:00): [4.756, 3.416, 2.344, 4.756] -> sum=15.272, avg=3.818\n      h13 (13:00): [4.019, 4.086, 1.741, 4.689] -> sum=14.535, avg=3.63375\n      h14 (14:00): [4.220, 3.684, 4.354, 8.372] -> sum=20.63, avg=5.1575\n      h15 (15:00): [3.416, 2.478, 1.808, 5.894] -> sum=13.596, avg=3.399\n      h16 (16:00): [2.478, 0.000, 0.469, 5.492] -> sum=8.439, avg=2.10975\n      h17 (17:00): [1.072, 0.067, -0.201, 5.827] -> sum=6.765, avg=1.69125\n      h18 (18:00): [0.067, -0.335, -0.938, 5.224] -> sum=4.018, avg=1.0045\n      h19 (19:00): [-0.670, 0.000, -0.536, 5.090] -> sum=3.884, avg=0.971\n      h20 (20:00): [0.000, 0.335, 0.938, 5.626] -> sum=6.899, avg=1.72475\n      h21 (21:00): [0.737, 0.804, 1.139, 4.488] -> sum=7.168, avg=1.792\n      h22 (22:00): [1.139, 1.474, 2.478, 7.167] -> sum=12.258, avg=3.0645\n      h23 (23:00): [1.608, 1.407, 3.282, 7.569] -> sum=13.866, avg=3.4665\n\n 37.
