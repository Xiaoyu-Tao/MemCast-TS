        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2017-01-04 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values.\n    However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can use the entire series.\n\n 2. We must choose a method for forecasting. Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple steps ahead) and the data is hourly with potential seasonality (daily pattern),\n    we can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide a complete set of 96 points, we might use:\n    - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components (trend, seasonality, and then residuals) but that might be complex for 96 steps.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that handles seasonality, or an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA).\n\n 3. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) which is a very short history. This makes it challenging to capture weekly seasonality (which we don't have enough data for) but daily seasonality (24 hours) is present.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal period of 24 (for daily seasonality). But with only 4 days, we have limited cycles.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can use a simple seasonal naive method: using the last available day (2017-01-04) as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the problem says to forecast the next 96 points (which is 4 days). However, the pattern might change and we have a trend? \n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet or SARIMA. But since we are in a text-based environment and must output the forecast without running code, \n    we have to rely on a simple method that can be reasoned.\n\n 7. Considering the data, we see a daily pattern: temperatures are lower at night and higher during the day. However, the last day (2017-01-04) shows a significant drop at the end.\n\n 8. We can try to model with a moving average or exponential smoothing, but with seasonality we need a seasonal model.\n\n 9. Given the challenge, I propose to use a Seasonal Naive model for the daily pattern. That is, we take the last complete day (2017-01-04) and use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? \n    But note: the next 4 days might not be exactly the same. However, without more data, it's a baseline.\n\n    However, looking at the data, the pattern of the first day (2017-01-01) and the next days are different. The last day (2017-01-04) ends with a drop to 5.417 at 23:00.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can compute the average of the four days for each hour and then use that as the forecast for the next four days? But note: we only have 4 days, and the last day is different.\n\n 11. Since the problem says there might be missing values (though in the provided 96 there are none) and we must be aware, we can use an interpolation if needed. But in this case, we don't have missing values in the input.\n\n 12. Given the above, I will use a simple method: \n      - We observe that the data has a daily pattern but also a downward trend in the last day. \n      - We can use the last day (2017-01-04) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 13. However, the problem requires 96 points and we must output the complete data.\n\n 14. Another idea: use the average of the four days for each hour. Let's calculate the average for each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days.\n\n     For hour 00:00: \n        Day1: 10.20, Day2: 14.421, Day3: 13.366, Day4: 12.592 -> average = (10.20+14.421+13.366+12.592)/4 = 12.64475\n\n     Similarly for each hour.\n\n 15. Then we can use this average for each hour for the next 4 days? But note: the next 4 days are 96 hours, so we would repeat the same 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 16. However, the data shows a trend: the temperatures on the first day (Jan 1) are generally higher than the last day (Jan 4) at the same hour? Not exactly: for example, at 00:00: \n        Jan1: 10.2, Jan2: 14.421, Jan3: 13.366, Jan4: 12.592 -> it went up then down.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and the lack of a clear trend, and the fact that we have only 4 days, using the average per hour might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n 18. Steps for the average per hour:\n\n      We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n      We'll calculate the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 19. Then we will repeat this 24-hour average pattern 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n 20. But note: the last day (Jan4) had a significant drop at the end. The average might smooth that out. Alternatively, we could use the last day as the forecast? \n\n 21. Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to provide a complete set, and given the short history, I choose the average method.\n\n 22. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00: (10.200000 + 14.421000 + 13.366000 + 12.592000) / 4 = (10.2+14.421+13.366+12.592)/4 = 50.579/4 = 12.64475\n      Hour 01: (10.060000 + 14.773000 + 12.381000 + 12.381000) / 4 = (10.06+14.773+12.381+12.381)/4 = 49.595/4 = 12.39875\n      Hour 02: (9.919000 + 14.843000 + 12.381000 + 12.451000) / 4 = (9.919+14.843+12.381+12.451)/4 = 49.594/4 = 12.3985\n      Hour 03: (9.215000 + 13.577000 + 11.537000 + 12.381000) / 4 = (9.215+13.577+11.537+12.381)/4 = 46.71/4 = 11.6775\n      Hour 04: (10.130000 + 12.874000 + 12.240000 + 13.296000) / 4 = (10.13+12.874+12.24+13.296)/4 = 48.54/4 = 12.135\n      Hour 05: (9.778000 + 13.225000 + 11.326000 + 14.280000) / 4 = (9.778+13.225+11.326+14.28)/4 = 48.609/4 = 12.15225\n      Hour 06: (10.130000 + 12.803000 + 11.889000 + 12.944000) / 4 = (10.13+12.803+11.889+12.944)/4 = 47.766/4 = 11.9415\n      Hour 07: (11.326000 + 13.436000 + 10.622000 + 12.451000) / 4 = (11.326+13.436+10.622+12.451)/4 = 47.835/4 = 11.95875\n      Hour 08: (10.130000 + 10.622000 + 10.763000 + 12.240000) / 4 = (10.13+10.622+10.763+12.24)/4 = 43.755/4 = 10.93875\n      Hour 09: (10.271000 + 10.693000 + 10.693000 + 12.522000) / 4 = (10.271+10.693+10.693+12.522)/4 = 44.179/4 = 11.04475\n      Hour 10: (9.989000 + 10.482000 + 10.482000 + 12.100000) / 4 = (9.989+10.482+10.482+12.1)/4 = 43.053/4 = 10.76325\n      Hour 11: (12.029000 + 9.638000 + 11.326000 + 14.140000) / 4 = (12.029+9.638+11.326+14.14)/4 = 47.133/4 = 11.78325\n      Hour 12: (11.889000 + 11.537000 + 11.256000 + 12.311000) / 4 = (11.889+11.537+11.256+12.311)/4 = 46.993/4 = 11.74825\n      Hour 13: (14.632000 + 13.999000 + 11.396000 + 12.170000) / 4 = (14.632+13.999+11.396+12.17)/4 = 52.197/4 = 13.04925\n      Hour 14: (16.672001 + 13.085000 + 12.100000 + 13.788000) / 4 = (16.672001+13.085+12.1+13.788)/4 = 55.645001/4 = 13.91125025\n      Hour 15: (15.476000 + 13.366000 + 11.678000 + 10.622000) / 4 = (15.476+13.366+11.678+10.622)/4 = 51.142/4 = 12.7855\n      Hour 16: (13.507000 + 13.788000 + 11.678000 + 10.482000) / 4 = (13.507+13.788+11.678+10.482)/4 = 49.455/4 = 12.36375\n      Hour 17: (13.225000 + 13.788000 + 12.803000 + 11.185000) / 4 = (13.225+13.788+12.803+11.185)/4 = 51.001/4 = 12.75025\n      Hour 18: (12.733000 + 13.436000 + 13.858000 + 8.864000) / 4 = (12.733+13.436+13.858+8.864)/4 = 48.891/4 = 12.22275\n      Hour 19: (12.522000 + 13.014000 + 14.351000 + 10.130000) / 4 = (12.522+13.014+14.351+10.13)/4 = 50.017/4 = 12.50425\n      Hour 20: (12.662000 + 13.858000 + 14.210000 + 9.356000) / 4 = (12.662+13.858+14.21+9.356)/4 = 50.086/4 = 12.5215\n      Hour 21: (14.140000 + 13.296000 + 13.788000 + 6.824000) / 4 = (14.14+13.296+13.788+6.824)/4 = 48.048/4 = 12.012\n      Hour 22: (14.210000 + 13.296000 + 12.451000 + 6.191000) / 4 = (14.21+13.296+12.451+6.191)/4 = 46.148/4 = 11.537\n      Hour 23: (13.718000 + 13.296000 + 12.451000 + 5.417000) / 4 = (13.718+13.296+12.451+5.417)/4 = 44.882/4 = 11.2205\n\n 23. Now, we have 24 values (for hours 0 to 23). We will repeat these 24 values 4 times to form 96 hours.\n\n 24. The next 96 hours start at 2017-01-05 00:00:00 and go to 2017-01-08 23:00:00.\n\n 25. We output the data in the same format: two columns (date and OT) with the OT being the average we computed for that hour, repeated for 4 days.\n\n 26. However, note: the last day in the input (Jan4) had a drop that might be the start of a downward trend? But without more data, we use the average.\n\n 27. We'll generate the dates:\n\n      Day 5: 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-05 23:00:00\n      Day 6: 2017-01-06 00:00:00 to 2017-01-06 23:00:00\n      Day 7: 2017-01-07 00:00:00 to 2017-01-07 23:00:00\n      Day 8: 2017-01-08 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00\n\n 28. And the OT values for each hour will be the same as the 24 averages we computed, repeated for each day.\n\n 29. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are to forecast the next 96 without missing.\n\n 30. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 31. Let's write the data:\n\n      We'll create a list of dates from 2017-01-05 00:00:00 to 2017-01-08 23:00:00 at hourly frequency.\n\n      And the OT values: \n          Day1 (Jan5): [12.64475, 12.39875, 12.3985, ... , 24 values]\n          Day2 (Jan6): same 24 values\n          Day3 (Jan7): same\n          Day4 (Jan8): same\n\n 32. We round the OT values to 6 decimal places as in the input (the input had up to 6 decimal places, but we computed with more, so we round to 6).\n\n 33. However, note: the input had some with 3 decimal places and some with 6? Actually, the input has up to 6. We'll output 6 decimal places.\n\n 34. Alternatively, we can output with the same precision as the input? The input has 3 to 6. We'll output 6.\n\n 35. Let's compute the averages to 6 decimal places:\n\n      We'll recalc and round to 6.\n\n      Actually, we can keep the computed averages and round to 6.\n\n 36. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 37. But note: the problem says \"be aware of missing values\" but we are not given any in the input. We are to forecast the next 96 without missing.\n\n 38. We output the complete 96 points.\n\n 39. Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-05 00:00:00 <value>\n2017-01-05 01:00:00 <value>\n...\n2017-01-08 23:00:00 <value>\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 40. We'll generate the dates and the repeated pattern.\n\n 41. The 24 average values (rounded to 6 decimal places) are:\n\n        hour0: 12.644750 -> 12.644750\n        hour1: 12.398750 -> 12.398750\n        hour2: 12.398500 -> 12.398500\n        hour3: 11.677500 -> 11.677500\n        hour4: 12.135000 -> 12.135000\n        hour5: 12.152250 -> 12.152250\n        hour6: 11.941500 -> 11.941500\n        hour7: 11.958750 -> 11.958750\n        hour8: 10.938750 -> 10.938750\n        hour9: 11.044750 -> 11.044750\n        hour10: 10.763250 -> 10.763250\n        hour11: 11.783250 -> 11.783250\n        hour12: 11.748250 -> 11.748250\n        hour13: 13.049250 -> 13.049250\n        hour14: 13.911250 -> 13.911250\n        hour15: 12.785500 -> 12.785500\n        hour16: 12.363750 -> 12.363750\n        hour17: 12.750250 -> 12.750250\n        hour18: 12.222750 -> 12.222750\n        hour19: 12.504250 -> 12.504250\n        hour20: 12.521500 -> 12.521500\n        hour21: 12.012000 -> 12.012000\n        hour22: 11.537000 -> 11.537000\n        hour23: 11.220500 -> 11.220500\n\n 42. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 5 (2017-01-05): \n          00:00:00 -> 12.644750\n          01:00:00 -> 12.398750\n          02:00:00 -> 12.398500\n          03:00:00 -> 11.677500\n          04:00:00 -> 12.135000\n          05:00:00 -> 12.152250\n          06:00:00 -> 11.941500\n          07:00:00 -> 11.958750\n          08:00:00 -> 10.938750\n          09:00:00 -> 11.044750\n          10:00:00 -> 10.763250\n          11:00:00 -> 11.783250\n          12:00:00 -> 11.748250\n          13:00:00 -> 13.049250\n          14:00:00 -> 13.911250\n          15:00:00 -> 12.785500\n          16:00:00 -> 12.363750\n          17:00:00 -> 12.750250\n          18:00:00 -> 12.222750\n          19:00:00 -> 12.504250\n          20:00:00 -> 12.521500\n          21:00:00 -> 12.012000\n          22:00:00 -> 11.537000\n          23:00:00 -> 11.220500\n\n      Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 43. We output the data in the format:\n\n        date                OT\n        2017-01-05 00:00:00 12.644750\n        2017-01-05 01:00:00 12.398750\n        ... \n\n 44. We note that the input started at 2017-01-01 00:00:00 and we are starting at 2017-01-05 00:00:00.\n\n 45. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 46.
