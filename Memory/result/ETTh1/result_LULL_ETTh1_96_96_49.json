        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00) for the LULL (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious in case the next 96 have gaps? \n    But the problem says: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided data might have missing values? However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 3. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates (which are the next 96 hours).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, we can use a time series model. Given the data shows daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours) and possibly weekly, \n but we only have 4 days, so we can focus on daily seasonality.\n\n We can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any, but from the data the trend is not obvious in 4 days)\n   - Seasonality (24-hour cycle)\n\n Given the small data size, we can use:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with a seasonal period of 24.\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n However, note: the data is only 4 days (96 points). This is very limited for fitting a seasonal model with 24 periods.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n   - Calculate the average pattern of the 4 days and then use that to forecast the next 4 days? But we must account for any trend or changes.\n\n But the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a robust method.\n\n Considering the constraints, we can try:\n   - Using a naive seasonal method: forecast each hour of the next day by the average of that hour in the past 4 days? \n     However, we have only 4 days, so we can compute the average for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the data does not show a strong consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n   For example, at 00:00: \n        Day1: 1.218\n        Day2: 0.609\n        Day3: 0.609\n        Day4: 0.609\n\n   This is decreasing? So maybe we should take the last day's pattern? or the average?\n\n However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Since we are limited by the data, we can use a moving average per hour, but we only have 4 points per hour.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (day4) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that would be repeating the same day 4 times.\n\n But note: the data from day1 to day4 shows a general decrease in the values? \n\n Let me check the average per day:\n   Day1: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24 -> \n        We can compute: \n        Day1: 1.218,1.249,1.279,1.279,1.279,1.310,1.157,0.731,0.975,1.066,1.279,1.188,1.066,1.066,1.097,1.066,0.883,0.701,0.761,0.822,0.761,0.640,0.640,0.670\n        Sum = 24.??? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that can handle short series. Since we are to forecast 96 points and we have 96 points, we can use:\n\n   - Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) with additive or multiplicative seasonality? \n     The data does not show increasing amplitude of seasonality, so additive might be appropriate.\n\n However, with only 4 seasons (each day being one cycle of 24 points), fitting a Holt-Winters might be challenging.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 points, we can use:\n\n   Method: \n     We will use the average of each hour across the 4 days to form a daily pattern, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the data has a downward trend? Let's see:\n\n        Day1: average = (1.218+1.249+...+0.670)/24 = let's calculate:\n\n        We can compute the average for each day:\n\n        Day1: \n          1.218, 1.249, 1.279, 1.279, 1.279, 1.310, 1.157, 0.731, 0.975, 1.066, 1.279, 1.188, 1.066, 1.066, 1.097, 1.066, 0.883, 0.701, 0.761, 0.822, 0.761, 0.640, 0.640, 0.670\n          Sum = 24.???\n\n        Let me do a quick sum:\n\n          We can add: \n          1.218+1.249=2.467; +1.279=3.746; +1.279=5.025; +1.279=6.304; +1.310=7.614; +1.157=8.771; +0.731=9.502; +0.975=10.477; \n          +1.066=11.543; +1.279=12.822; +1.188=14.01; +1.066=15.076; +1.066=16.142; +1.097=17.239; +1.066=18.305; +0.883=19.188; \n          +0.701=19.889; +0.761=20.65; +0.822=21.472; +0.761=22.233; +0.640=22.873; +0.640=23.513; +0.670=24.183\n\n          Average Day1 = 24.183 / 24 = 1.007625\n\n        Day2: \n          0.609,0.609,0.518,0.609,0.670,0.670,0.792,0.761,1.097,1.005,1.249,1.036,0.914,1.218,1.066,0.944,1.097,1.005,0.883,0.853,0.761,0.670,0.670,0.701\n          Sum: \n          0.609+0.609=1.218; +0.518=1.736; +0.609=2.345; +0.670=3.015; +0.670=3.685; +0.792=4.477; +0.761=5.238; +1.097=6.335; \n          +1.005=7.34; +1.249=8.589; +1.036=9.625; +0.914=10.539; +1.218=11.757; +1.066=12.823; +0.944=13.767; +1.097=14.864; \n          +1.005=15.869; +0.883=16.752; +0.853=17.605; +0.761=18.366; +0.670=19.036; +0.670=19.706; +0.701=20.407\n\n          Average Day2 = 20.407 / 24 = 0.8502917\n\n        Day3:\n          0.609,0.579,0.548,0.579,0.701,0.670,0.640,0.670,0.975,1.157,1.127,1.036,0.853,1.157,0.914,0.822,0.944,0.853,0.701,0.670,0.670,0.670,0.609,0.792\n          Sum:\n          0.609+0.579=1.188; +0.548=1.736; +0.579=2.315; +0.701=3.016; +0.670=3.686; +0.640=4.326; +0.670=4.996; +0.975=5.971; \n          +1.157=7.128; +1.127=8.255; +1.036=9.291; +0.853=10.144; +1.157=11.301; +0.914=12.215; +0.822=13.037; +0.944=13.981; \n          +0.853=14.834; +0.701=15.535; +0.670=16.205; +0.670=16.875; +0.670=17.545; +0.609=18.154; +0.792=18.946\n\n          Average Day3 = 18.946 / 24 = 0.7894167\n\n        Day4:\n          0.609,0.609,0.609,0.609,0.609,0.640,0.761,0.761,0.975,1.066,0.883,0.853,0.670,0.944,0.975,0.975,0.853,0.731,0.701,0.640,0.761,0.701,0.761,0.670\n          Sum:\n          0.609*5 = 3.045 (for first 5) \n          then 0.640 -> 3.685; +0.761=4.446; +0.761=5.207; +0.975=6.182; +1.066=7.248; +0.883=8.131; +0.853=8.984; +0.670=9.654; \n          +0.944=10.598; +0.975=11.573; +0.975=12.548; +0.853=13.401; +0.731=14.132; +0.701=14.833; +0.640=15.473; +0.761=16.234; \n          +0.701=16.935; +0.761=17.696; +0.670=18.366\n\n          Average Day4 = 18.366 / 24 = 0.76525\n\n        The daily averages are: 1.0076, 0.8503, 0.7894, 0.7653 -> downward trend.\n\n        So we cannot just repeat the last day. We should account for the trend.\n\n 4. We can model the trend and then the seasonality.\n\n    We can do:\n        Step 1: Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n        Step 2: Forecast the trend component for the next 96 points (using a linear trend? or exponential? the trend seems linear decreasing)\n        Step 3: Add the seasonal component (which is the average pattern for a day) to the trend.\n\n    However, with only 4 days, decomposing might be unstable.\n\n 5. Alternative: use a linear regression with:\n        - Time index (t=1 to 96) for the trend\n        - Hour of the day (categorical with 24 levels) for seasonality.\n\n    We can fit:\n        LULL_t = beta0 + beta1 * t + [24 seasonal indicators] + error\n\n    Then forecast for t=97 to 192.\n\n    But note: we have 96 points and 25 parameters (1 intercept, 1 trend, 24 dummies) -> we have 96-25=71 degrees of freedom, which is acceptable.\n\n    Steps for linear model:\n\n        Create variables:\n          t: 1,2,...,96\n          hour: 0,1,...,23 repeated 4 times.\n\n        Then we can fit a linear model:\n\n          LULL = b0 + b1*t + b2*(hour==1) + b3*(hour==2) + ... + b25*(hour=23)\n\n        But note: we have to include all 24? Actually, we leave one hour as reference (say hour0) to avoid multicollinearity.\n\n        So the model would be:\n\n          LULL = b0 + b1*t + \n                 b2*(indicator for hour1) + ... + b25*(indicator for hour23)\n\n        Then for forecasting:\n\n          For time t=97 (which is the first hour of the next day, i.e., hour0 of day5) we use:\n             LULL_97 = b0 + b1*97   [because hour0 is the reference, so we don't add any hour coefficient for hour0]\n\n          For time t=98 (hour1 of day5): \n             LULL_98 = b0 + b1*98 + b2\n\n        and so on.\n\n    However, the trend might not be linear? We can check the residuals.\n\n    But given the time, we can try this linear model.\n\n 6. Implementation:\n\n    We have the data for 96 points. We can fit a linear model with trend and hourly dummies.\n\n    But note: the problem says there might be missing values? In the provided data there are none, so we can proceed.\n\n    We'll create:\n\n        t = range(1,97)\n        hour_index = [0,1,...,23] repeated 4 times.\n\n    Then we can use OLS.\n\n    However, we are to forecast 96 points ahead. We need to create the same variables for the next 96:\n\n        t: 97 to 192\n        hour_index: [0,1,...,23] repeated 4 times (for 4 days)\n\n 7. Let's code it in our mind:\n\n    We'll do:\n\n        import pandas as pd\n        import numpy as np\n        from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n        # Given data as a DataFrame 'df' with index as datetime and column 'LULL'\n\n        # Reset index to have a column for datetime and then extract hour\n        df.reset_index(inplace=True)\n        df['hour'] = df['date'].dt.hour\n\n        # Create a time index t\n        df['t'] = range(1, len(df)+1)\n\n        # Create dummies for hour (we'll use one-hot encoding, but then drop one category to avoid dummy trap)\n        dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['hour'], prefix='hour', drop_first=False) \n        # But we want to drop one? Actually, we can let the intercept represent one hour and then the others are relative? \n        # Alternatively, we can drop one. Let's drop hour0 so that the intercept is for hour0.\n\n        # Instead, we can use:\n        #   dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['hour'], prefix='hour')\n        #   then drop the first column (hour_0) to avoid multicollinearity? \n        #   But note: we have 24 hours, so we need 23 dummies? and the intercept will represent hour0.\n\n        # But we have 24 hours, so we can create 23 dummies and leave hour0 as the base.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can use the intercept to capture the base and then 23 dummies? \n\n        # Let me do: \n        #   X = df[['t']]  # the trend variable\n        #   for h in range(1,24): \n        #       X[f'hour_{h}'] = (df['hour'] == h).astype(int)\n\n        # Then the model: \n        #   LULL = intercept + beta_t * t + beta_1 * hour_1 + ... + beta_23 * hour_23\n\n        # Then for hour0: all hour_1 to hour_23 are 0 -> intercept + beta_t * t\n        # For hour1: intercept + beta_t * t + beta_1\n\n        # But note: the intercept is for hour0 at t=0? We want the intercept to be for hour0 at t=0? but we have t starting at 1.\n\n        # We can fit the model.\n\n        # However, we are in a text-based environment, so we cannot run code. We have to do it manually? \n\n        # Alternatively, we can use the average method with trend adjustment.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the data, we can use a simpler method:\n\n    We observe the daily averages are decreasing linearly? \n\n        Day1: 1.0076\n        Day2: 0.8503\n        Day3: 0.7894\n        Day4: 0.7653\n\n        We can fit a linear trend to the daily averages:\n\n            day_index = [1,2,3,4]\n            avg = [1.0076, 0.8503, 0.7894, 0.7653]\n\n        We can do a linear regression: avg = a + b * day_index\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n            n = 4\n            sum_x = 1+2+3+4 = 10\n            sum_y = 1.0076+0.8503+0.7894+0.7653 = 3.4126\n            sum_xy = 1*1.0076 + 2*0.8503 + 3*0.7894 + 4*0.7653 = 1.0076 + 1.7006 + 2.3682 + 3.0612 = 8.1376\n            sum_x2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n            b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)**2)\n               = (4*8.1376 - 10*3.4126) / (4*30 - 100)\n               = (32.5504 - 34.126) / (120 - 100)\n               = (-1.5756) / 20 = -0.07878\n\n            a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (3.4126 - (-0.07878)*10) / 4 = (3.4126 + 0.7878) / 4 = 4.2004 / 4 = 1.0501\n\n        So the daily average trend: \n            day5: a + b*5 = 1.0501 - 0.07878*5 = 1.0501 - 0.3939 = 0.6562\n            day6: 1.0501 - 0.07878*6 = 1.0501 - 0.47268 = 0.57742\n            day7: 1.0501 - 0.07878*7 = 1.0501 - 0.55146 = 0.49864\n            day8: 1.0501 - 0.07878*8 = 1.0501 - 0.63024 = 0.41986\n\n        Then, we can compute the seasonal pattern: the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days, but then adjust for the trend? \n\n        We can de-trend the data by:\n\n            For each day, subtract the daily average from each hour? But that would remove the level. \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the average for each hour relative to the daily average? \n\n        Let me compute the seasonal indices:\n\n            For hour0: \n                Day1: 1.218 -> relative = 1.218 - 1.0076 = 0.2104\n                Day2: 0.609 - 0.8503 = -0.2413\n                Day3: 0.609 - 0.7894 = -0.1804\n                Day4: 0.609 - 0.7653 = -0.1563\n                Average relative = (0.2104 -0.2413 -0.1804 -0.1563)/4 = (-0.3676)/4 = -0.0919\n\n            Then for the forecast on day5 at hour0: \n                daily_avg(day5) + seasonal_index(hour0) = 0.6562 - 0.0919 = 0.5643\n\n        But wait, the relative indices are not consistent? \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour across days without de-trending? \n\n        But then we are mixing different levels.\n\n        We can do: normalize by the daily average? multiplicative? \n\n        But the data doesn't show multiplicative seasonality? \n\n        We can try additive decomposition.\n\n        Steps for additive decomposition:\n\n            Step 1: Compute the trend component for each hour? We can use moving average of 24 hours? But we have only 96 points, so we can do:\n\n            We can use centered moving average of window 24? but at the ends we have problems.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use the daily average as the trend for that day? \n\n            Then the seasonal component for a given hour in a day is: LULL - daily_avg(that day)\n\n            Then the average seasonal component for hour0 is the average of (LULL_hour0 - daily_avg) for the 4 days.\n\n            Then the residual is what remains.\n\n        Then for forecasting:\n\n            For a future day d and hour h:\n                forecast = trend(d) + seasonal(h)\n\n            Where trend(d) = a + b*d   (d is the day index: day5->5, day6->6, etc.)\n\n        We have 4 days of data, so we can compute the seasonal indices for each hour (0 to 23) as the average of (LULL - daily_avg) for that hour.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (day5 to day8) we do:\n\n            For day5 (d=5): \n                for hour0: trend(5) + seasonal(0) = 0.6562 + [seasonal for hour0]\n                ...\n\n        How to compute seasonal for hour0:\n\n            Day1: 1.218 - 1.0076 = 0.2104\n            Day2: 0.609 - 0.8503 = -0.2413\n            Day3: 0.609 - 0.7894 = -0.1804\n            Day4: 0.609 - 0.7653 = -0.1563\n            Average = (0.2104 -0.2413 -0.1804 -0.1563)/4 = (-0.3676)/4 = -0.0919\n\n        Similarly for hour1:\n\n            Day1: 1.249 - 1.0076 = 0.2414\n            Day2: 0.609 - 0.8503 = -0.2413\n            Day3: 0.579 - 0.7894 = -0.2104\n            Day4: 0.609 - 0.7653 = -0.1563\n            Average = (0.2414 -0.2413 -0.2104 -0.1563)/4 = (0.2414 -0.6080)/4 = (-0.3666)/4 = -0.09165\n\n        We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n        Then we forecast the next 4 days by:\n\n            For day in [5,6,7,8]:\n                daily_avg = a + b * day\n                for hour in 0..23:\n                    forecast = daily_avg + seasonal[hour]\n\n        But note: we have 4 days to forecast, and we break into 24 hours each -> 96 points.\n\n 9. Let's compute the seasonal indices for each hour:\n\n    We'll create an array `seasonal` of length 24.\n\n    For hour h (0<=h<=23):\n\n        seasonal[h] = ( (value_day1_hourh - avg_day1) + (value_day2_hourh - avg_day2) + (value_day3_hourh - avg_day3) + (value_day4_hourh - avg_day4) ) / 4\n\n    Then for the future:\n\n        day5: daily_avg5 = 0.6562\n        day6: daily_avg6 = 0.57742\n        day7: daily_avg7 = 0.49864\n        day8: daily_avg8 = 0.41986\n\n        Then for hour0 of day5: 0.6562 + seasonal[0] = 0.6562 - 0.0919 = 0.5643\n\n        We do similarly for every hour.\n\n 10. We must compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours.\n\n     We have the data:\n\n        Day1: [1.218,1.249,1.279,1.279,1.279,1.310,1.157,0.731,0.975,1.066,1.279,1.188,1.066,1.066,1.097,1.066,0.883,0.701,0.761,0.822,0.761,0.640,0.640,0.670]\n        Day2: [0.609,0.609,0.518,0.609,0.670,0.670,0.792,0.761,1.097,1.005,1.249,1.036,0.914,1.218,1.066,0.944,1.097,1.005,0.883,0.853,0.761,0.670,0.670,0.701]\n        Day3: [0.609,0.579,0.548,0.579,0.701,0.670,0.640,0.670,0.975,1.157,1.127,1.036,0.853,1.157,0.914,0.822,0.944,0.853,0.701,0.670,0.670,0.670,0.609,0.792]\n        Day4: [0.609,0.609,0.609,0.609,0.609,0.640,0.761,0.761,0.975,1.066,0.883,0.853,0.670,0.944,0.975,0.975,0.853,0.731,0.701,0.640,0.761,0.701,0.761,0.670]\n\n     And the daily averages: [1.007625, 0.8502917, 0.7894167, 0.76525]\n\n     We compute for each hour the deviation from its day's average.\n\n     Then average these deviations over the 4 days.\n\n     Let's do hour0 (index0):\n\n        Day1: 1.218 - 1.007625 = 0.210375\n        Day2: 0.609 - 0.8502917 = -0.2412917\n        Day3: 0.609 - 0.7894167 = -0.1804167\n        Day4: 0.609 - 0.76525 = -0.15625\n        Sum = 0.210375 -0.2412917 -0.1804167 -0.15625 = -0.3675834\n        Average = -0.3675834 / 4 = -0.09189585\n\n     Similarly, hour1 (index1):\n\n        Day1: 1.249 - 1.007625 = 0.241375\n        Day2: 0.609 - 0.8502917 = -0.2412917\n        Day3: 0.579 - 0.7894167 = -0.2104167\n        Day4: 0.609 - 0.76525 = -0.15625\n        Sum = 0.241375 -0.2412917 -0.2104167 -0.15625 = -0.3665834\n        Average = -0.3665834 / 4 = -0.09164585\n\n     We do for all 24 hours.\n\n     Then we form the seasonal component array: `s` of length 24.\n\n 11. Then we create the forecast for the next 4 days:\n\n        Day5: daily_avg5 = 0.6562\n        Day6: daily_avg6 = 0.57742\n        Day7: daily_avg7 = 0.49864\n        Day8: daily_avg8 = 0.41986\n\n        For hour in 0..23 for each day:\n\n            day5_hour_i = daily_avg5 + s[i]\n            day6_hour_i = daily_avg6 + s[i]\n            day7_hour_i = daily_avg7 + s[i]\n            day8_hour_i = daily_avg8 + s[i]\n\n 12. We must generate the dates:\n\n        The last date in the given data is 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n        The next 96 hours:\n\n          2017-01-17 00:00:00 to 2017-01-20 23:00:00\n\n        We can generate:\n\n          start_date = '2017-01-17 00:00:00'\n          then 96 hours.\n\n 13. We'll compute the seasonal indices for all 24 hours and then the forecast.\n\n     Due to the length, we do it programmatically in our mind? \n\n     But we are to provide the data, so we have to do the calculations.\n\n     Alternatively, we can write a table of the seasonal indices:\n\n        s[0] = -0.09189585\n        s[1] = -0.09164585\n        ... \n\n     We'll compute for each hour.\n\n     However, given the time, we can do a few more and then extrapolate the method.\n\n     But we are to provide the complete data, so we must do all.\n\n     Let me do hour2 (index2):\n\n        Day1: 1.279 - 1.007625 = 0.271375\n        Day2: 0.518 - 0.8502917 = -0.3322917\n        Day3: 0.548 - 0.7894167 = -0.2414167\n        Day4: 0.609 - 0.76525 = -0.15625\n        Sum = 0.271375 -0.3322917 -0.2414167 -0.15625 = -0.4585834\n        Average = -0.4585834/4 = -0.11464585\n\n     hour3:\n\n        Day1: 1.279 - 1.007625 = 0.271375\n        Day2: 0.609 - 0.8502917 = -0.2412917\n        Day3: 0.579 - 0.7894167 = -0.2104167\n        Day4: 0.609 - 0.76525 = -0.15625\n        Sum = 0.271375 -0.2412917 -0.2104167 -0.15625 = -0.3365834\n        Average = -0.3365834/4 = -0.08414585\n\n     This is tedious, but we can continue similarly.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour without de-trending? \n\n        For hour0: (1.218+0.609+0.609+0.609)/4 = 3.045/4 = 0.76125\n\n        Then we see that the overall level is decreasing, so we adjust by the daily trend? \n\n        But we already have the daily trend, so we can use the additive decomposition is more appropriate.\n\n Given the time, we will compute the seasonal indices for all 24 and then the forecast.\n\n But note: the problem says we must provide the complete data, so we have to output 96 numbers.\n\n We decide to do the additive decomposition.\n\n We'll compute the seasonal indices for each hour:\n\n   s[h] = ( (d1[h]-avg1) + (d2[h]-avg2) + (d3[h]-avg3) + (d4[h]-avg4) ) / 4\n\n Then for the next day, we use: \n        forecast = (a + b * (d)) + s[h]\n\n where d is the day index (5,6,7,8) and h is the hour (0..23)\n\n We have:\n\n   a = 1.0501, b = -0.07878\n\n   daily_avg5 = 1.0501 -0.07878*5 = 0.6562\n   daily_avg6 = 1.0501 -0.07878*6 = 0.57742\n   daily_avg7 = 1.0501 -0.07878*7 = 0.49864\n   daily_avg8 = 1.0501 -0.07878*8 = 0.41986\n\n Now, we compute s[0..23]:\n\n

Due to the length, we will generate the dates and the forecasted values.\n\n     The next 96 hours:\n\n        start = 2017-01-17 00:00:00\n        then 2017-01-17 01:00:00, etc.\n\n     We'll create a list.\n\n 17.

We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-01-17 00:00:00 0.564\n2017-01-17 01:00:00 0.565\n... \n2017-01-20 23:00:00 ... \n```\n\n 19. Given the large number of points, we will generate the entire set.\n\n However, manually doing 96 points is error-prone. We are an expert so we can do it by a small script in our mind.\n\n But since we are to provide the answer, we will compute and list them.\n\n 20. We decide to output the values with the dates.\n\n Let's do it systematically.\n\n   dates = []\n   values = []\n\n   # Day5: 2017-01-17, base = 0.6562\n   for h in range(24):\n        date = f\"2017-01-17 {h:02d}:00:00\"\n        value = round(0.6562 + s[h], 3)\n        # but s[h] is a float, we round to 3 decimals\n\n   # Day6: 2017-01-18, base = 0.57742\n   for h in range(24):\n        date = f\"2017-01-18 {h:02d}:00:00\"\n        value = round(0.57742 + s[h], 3)\n\n   # Day7: 2017-01-19, base = 0.49864\n   for h in range(24):\n        date = f\"2017-01-19 {h:02d}:00:00\"\n        value = round(0.49864 + s[h], 3)\n\n   # Day8: 2017-01-20, base = 0.41986\n   for h in range(24):\n        date = f\"2017-01-20 {h:02d}:00:00\"\n        value = round(0.41986 + s[h], 3)\n\n 21. We have s[0..23] as computed above.\n\n 22. We will now generate the 96 lines.\n\n But note: the rounding might cause small variations.\n\n Given the time, we will provide the data as computed.\n\n However, we must ensure we output 96 points.\n\n Let's do the first day explicitly as above, then the rest similarly.\n\n We'll generate the entire set and format it.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n So we will write the full 96 lines.\n\n Due to the length, we will only show the first few and last few in the thinking, but in the final answer we will output all.\n\n But the instructions require the complete answer.\n\n We decide to generate the forecasted values for the next 96 hours.\n\n However, manually typing 96 lines is not feasible. We are an AI, so we can do it by a virtual program.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   s = [-0.09189585, -0.09164585, -0.11464585, -0.08414585, -0.03839585, -0.03064585, -0.01564585, -0.12239585, 0.15235415, 0.22035415, 0.28135415, 0.17510415, 0.02260415, 0.24310415, 0.15985415, 0.09860415, 0.09110415, -0.03064585, -0.09164585, -0.10689585, -0.11489585, -0.18289585, -0.18314585, -0.14489585]\n\n   bases = [0.6562, 0.57742, 0.49864, 0.41986]\n\n   for day in range(4):\n        for hour in range(24):\n            value = bases[day] + s[hour]\n            # round to 3 decimals\n            value = round(value, 3)\n\n   Then format the date accordingly.\n\n 23. We generate the dates starting from '2017-01-17 00:00:00'\n\n 24. We output in the required format.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
