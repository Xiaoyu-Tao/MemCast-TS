        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for LUFL (Low UseFul Load) from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and shows daily patterns (e.g., higher during the day, lower at night).\n 2. There might be missing values in the provided data? But in the given data, we have 96 consecutive points without any missing value in the provided snippet.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. But the provided 96 points are complete. So for forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete for modeling.\n 3. We must forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Given the daily seasonality (period=24) and the relatively short history, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends.\n Since we are to provide the forecast without the ability to run actual code, we must rely on a standard method.\n\n We can use a seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day. However, the data does not look exactly the same every day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) or a seasonal ARIMA model. But note: we are to provide the forecast without running code.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert and must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n Since we cannot run code, we have to simulate a reasonable forecast.\n\n Observation from the data:\n  - The data has a daily pattern: low at night, then rises in the morning, peaks during the day, and then falls again.\n  - There is also a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, we can do:\n\n  Option 1: Use the average of the last 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n  But note: the data from 2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21 (4 days) is available.\n\n  We can compute the average for each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n  However, we see that the first day (2017-03-18) and the other days are different. For example, the first day has a spike at 00:00 of 1.492, but the next day at 00:00 is 4.447? \n  Actually, looking at the data, the first day (18th) and the third day (20th) have low values at 00:00, but the 19th and 21st have high values at 00:00.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-21) as the pattern for the next day? But that might not capture the average behavior.\n\n  Option 2: Since the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any, we can use a simple method: \n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), take the average of that hour over the 4 available days, and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n  Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n  Hour 00: (1.492 + 4.447 + 1.797 + 4.386) / 4 = (1.122) / 4? Let me compute:\n\n      1.492 + 4.447 = 5.939\n      5.939 + 1.797 = 7.736\n      7.736 + 4.386 = 12.122\n      12.122 / 4 = 3.0305\n\n  Similarly, we do for each hour.\n\n  But note: the data on 2017-03-19 00:00:00 is 4.447 and 2017-03-21 00:00:00 is 4.386, which are much higher than the other two. This might be an outlier? \n  maybe due to a weekend? But we don't have the day of the week.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of outliers? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n  However, the problem says we are to forecast. Since we are not given any context about holidays or weekends, we'll use the average.\n\n  Steps for forecasting:\n\n    For each hour h in [0,23]:\n        values = [all values at hour h from the 4 days]\n        forecast_value = average(values)\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-03-22 to 2017-03-25), for each day, we assign the forecast_value for that hour.\n\n  But note: the data starts at 2017-03-18 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-03-21 23:00:00. The next 96 hours are:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-03-22 00:00:00 to 2017-03-22 23:00:00\n      Day 2: 2017-03-23 00:00:00 to 2017-03-23 23:00:00\n      Day 3: 2017-03-24 00:00:00 to 2017-03-24 23:00:00\n      Day 4: 2017-03-25 00:00:00 to 2017-03-25 23:00:00\n\n  We will generate 24 * 4 = 96 points.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the average might smooth out the pattern. But without a more sophisticated model, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n  Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 00: (1.492, 4.447, 1.797, 4.386) -> 3.0305\n    Hour 01: (1.523, 4.325, 1.767, 4.356) -> (1.523+4.325+1.767+4.356)/4 = 11.971/4 = 2.99275\n    Hour 02: (1.462, 4.356, 1.797, 1.706) -> (1.462+4.356+1.797+1.706)/4 = 9.321/4 = 2.33025\n    Hour 03: (1.736, 1.980, 1.797, 1.553) -> (1.736+1.980+1.797+1.553)/4 = 7.066/4 = 1.7665\n    Hour 04: (1.706, 1.888, 1.675, 1.828) -> (1.706+1.888+1.675+1.828)/4 = 7.097/4 = 1.77425\n    Hour 05: (1.888, 2.163, 2.071, 2.406) -> (1.888+2.163+2.071+2.406)/4 = 8.528/4 = 2.132\n    Hour 06: (2.680, 2.528, 2.376, 2.894) -> (2.680+2.528+2.376+2.894)/4 = 10.478/4 = 2.6195\n    Hour 07: (3.076, 3.107, 3.137, 3.290) -> (3.076+3.107+3.137+3.290)/4 = 12.61/4 = 3.1525\n    Hour 08: (3.198, 2.955, 3.350, 3.107) -> (3.198+2.955+3.350+3.107)/4 = 12.61/4 = 3.1525? Wait, let me recalculate: \n        3.198+2.955=6.153; 6.153+3.350=9.503; 9.503+3.107=12.61 -> 12.61/4=3.1525\n    But wait, the 08:00 on 2017-03-20 is 3.350 and on 2017-03-21 is 3.107? Actually, the data for 2017-03-21 08:00 is 3.107? \n    Let me check: \n        2017-03-18 08:00:00 3.198\n        2017-03-19 08:00:00 2.955\n        2017-03-20 08:00:00 3.350\n        2017-03-21 08:00:00 3.107\n    So 3.198+2.955+3.350+3.107 = 12.61 -> 3.1525\n\n    Hour 09: (2.802, 3.076, 3.076, 2.894) -> (2.802+3.076+3.076+2.894)/4 = 11.848/4 = 2.962\n    Hour 10: (2.863, 3.046, 3.107, 2.802) -> (2.863+3.046+3.107+2.802)/4 = 11.818/4 = 2.9545\n    Hour 11: (3.503, 3.107, 3.381, 2.955) -> (3.503+3.107+3.381+2.955)/4 = 12.946/4 = 3.2365\n    Hour 12: (2.528, 2.467, 2.406, 2.284) -> (2.528+2.467+2.406+2.284)/4 = 9.685/4 = 2.42125\n    Hour 13: (2.680, 2.376, 2.437, 2.406) -> (2.680+2.376+2.437+2.406)/4 = 9.899/4 = 2.47475\n    Hour 14: (2.437, 2.559, 2.680, 2.376) -> (2.437+2.559+2.680+2.376)/4 = 10.052/4 = 2.513\n    Hour 15: (2.863, 2.437, 2.437, 1.980) -> (2.863+2.437+2.437+1.980)/4 = 9.717/4 = 2.42925\n    Hour 16: (2.863, 2.741, 2.619, 2.467) -> (2.863+2.741+2.619+2.467)/4 = 10.69/4 = 2.6725\n    Hour 17: (2.985, 3.320, 3.350, 2.955) -> (2.985+3.320+3.350+2.955)/4 = 12.61/4 = 3.1525\n    Hour 18: (2.741, 3.076, 2.894, 2.924) -> (2.741+3.076+2.894+2.924)/4 = 11.635/4 = 2.90875\n    Hour 19: (2.863, 2.833, 2.955, 2.985) -> (2.863+2.833+2.955+2.985)/4 = 11.636/4 = 2.909\n    Hour 20: (2.619, 2.650, 2.498, 2.802) -> (2.619+2.650+2.498+2.802)/4 = 10.569/4 = 2.64225\n    Hour 21: (2.315, 2.315, 2.498, 2.498) -> (2.315+2.315+2.498+2.498)/4 = 9.626/4 = 2.4065\n    Hour 22: (1.888, 1.919, 2.071, 2.041) -> (1.888+1.919+2.071+2.041)/4 = 7.919/4 = 1.97975\n    Hour 23: (2.224, 2.163, 2.102, 1.919) -> (2.224+2.163+2.102+1.919)/4 = 8.408/4 = 2.102\n\n  Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n\n    Day1 (2017-03-22): \n        00:00: 3.0305\n        01:00: 2.99275\n        02:00: 2.33025\n        03:00: 1.7665\n        04:00: 1.77425\n        05:00: 2.132\n        06:00: 2.6195\n        07:00: 3.1525\n        08:00: 3.1525\n        09:00: 2.962\n        10:00: 2.9545\n        11:00: 3.2365\n        12:00: 2.42125\n        13:00: 2.47475\n        14:00: 2.513\n        15:00: 2.42925\n        16:00: 2.6725\n        17:00: 3.1525\n        18:00: 2.90875\n        19:00: 2.909\n        20:00: 2.64225\n        21:00: 2.4065\n        22:00: 1.97975\n        23:00: 2.102\n\n    Then repeat the same pattern for the next 3 days.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to forecast the next 96. We are not given any missing values in the provided 96, so we assume the forecast is for 96 consecutive hours.\n\n  But we must output the exact dates and the forecasted LUFL.\n\n  Let's generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2017-03-22 00:00:00\n    Then 2017-03-22 01:00:00, ... until 2017-03-25 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n  We'll write the forecasted values by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n  However, note: the average pattern we computed is for the same hour across the 4 days. This is a simple average method.\n\n  But we must be cautious: the average might not be the best if there is a trend. However, the data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days.\n\n  Alternatively, we could use a model that accounts for the last observed value and the seasonality. But without running code, the average is a straightforward approach.\n\n  We'll output the forecast with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  The input had 3 decimal places, so we round to 3 decimals.\n\n  Let me round the averages:\n\n    h00: 3.0305 -> 3.031\n    h01: 2.99275 -> 2.993\n    h02: 2.33025 -> 2.330\n    h03: 1.7665 -> 1.767\n    Note: 1.7665 rounded to 3 decimals: 1.767 because the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up.\n    Similarly, we round each.\n\n  But note: the input data has at most 3 decimal places, so we output 3.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimals by formatting.\n\n  Let me recalculate and round each:\n\n    h00: 3.0305 -> 3.031\n    h01: 2.99275 -> 2.993\n    h02: 2.33025 -> 2.330\n    h03: 1.7665 -> 1.767\n    h04: 1.77425 -> 1.774\n    h05: 2.132 -> 2.132\n    h06: 2.6195 -> 2.620\n    h07: 3.1525 -> 3.153\n    h08: 3.1525 -> 3.153\n    h09: 2.962 -> 2.962\n    h10: 2.9545 -> 2.955\n    h11: 3.2365 -> 3.237\n    h12: 2.42125 -> 2.421\n    h13: 2.47475 -> 2.475\n    h14: 2.513 -> 2.513\n    h15: 2.42925 -> 2.429\n    h16: 2.6725 -> 2.673\n    h17: 3.1525 -> 3.153\n    h18: 2.90875 -> 2.909\n    h19: 2.909 -> 2.909\n    h20: 2.64225 -> 2.642\n    h21: 2.4065 -> 2.407\n    h22: 1.97975 -> 1.980\n    h23: 2.102 -> 2.102\n\n  Then the first day (2017-03-22) will have:\n\n    00:00: 3.031\n    01:00: 2.993\n    02:00: 2.330\n    03:00: 1.767\n    04:00: 1.774\n    05:00: 2.132\n    06:00: 2.620\n    07:00: 3.153\n    08:00: 3.153\n    09:00: 2.962\n    10:00: 2.955\n    11:00: 3.237\n    12:00: 2.421\n    13:00: 2.475\n    14:00: 2.513\n    15:00: 2.429\n    16:00: 2.673\n    17:00: 3.153\n    18:00: 2.909\n    19:00: 2.909\n    20:00: 2.642\n    21:00: 2.407\n    22:00: 1.980\n    23:00: 2.102\n\n  And then the same for the next three days.\n\n  But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the input, so we assume the forecast is for the next 96 consecutive hours.\n\n  We output 96 rows.\n\n  Format:\n\n      <answer>\n      \n```\n\n2017-03-22 00:00:00 3.031\n2017-03-22 01:00:00 2.993\n2017-03-22 02:00:00 2.330\n2017-03-22 03:00:00 1.767\n2017-03-22 04:00:00 1.774\n2017-03-22 05:00:00 2.132\n2017-03-22 06:00:00 2.620\n2017-03-22 07:00:00 3.153\n2017-03-22 08:00:00 3.153\n2017-03-22 09:00:00 2.962\n2017-03-22 10:00:00 2.955\n2017-03-22 11:00:00 3.237\n2017-03-22 12:00:00 2.421\n2017-03-22 13:00:00 2.475\n2017-03-22 14:00:00 2.513\n2017-03-22 15:00:00 2.429\n2017-03-22 16:00:00 2.673\n2017-03-22 17:00:00 3.153\n2017-03-22 18:00:00 2.909\n2017-03-22 19:00:00 2.909\n2017-03-22 20:00:00 2.642\n2017-03-22 21:00:00 2.407\n2017-03-22 22:00:00 1.980\n2017-03-22 23:00:00 2.102\n2017-03-23 00:00:00 3.031\n2017-03-23 01:00:00 2.993\n... and so on until 2017-03-25 23:00:00\n\n  We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.

For example, I see \"2017-03-25\" for 00:00 and then 01:00, but then at 03:00 I wrote \"2017-03-25\" correctly? \n\n  Actually, I think I wrote the entire block correctly. But to be safe, I'll generate the dates programmatically in the output.\n\n  We are writing 4 days, each with 24 hours, so we can write:\n\n      base_date = \"2017-03-22\"\n      for day in range(0,4):\n          for hour in range(0,24):\n              date_str = (base_date + timedelta(days=day)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\") \n              time_str = f\"{hour:02d}:00:00\"\n              value = the value for that hour\n\n  But since we are writing by hand, we have to be careful.\n\n  We'll write the entire 96 lines as above.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the data might be sampled every 15 minutes? But the provided data is hourly. So we are forecasting hourly.\n\n  We are done.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only given LUFL. So we only forecast LUFL.\n\n  We output the forecast in the same format: two columns: date and LUFL.\n\n  We write:\n\n      <answer>\n      \n```\n\n[the 96 lines]\n\n```\n\n      </answer>\n\n  We are done.\n\n  However, note: the average method might not be the most accurate, but it is a simple and common baseline for time series with seasonality.\n\n  If we had more data, we could use a more sophisticated model, but with only 4 days, this is reasonable.\n\n  Let me write the answer.\n",
