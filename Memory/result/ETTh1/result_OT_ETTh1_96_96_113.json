        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-26 00:00:00 to 2017-09-29 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days from 2017-09-30 00:00:00 to 2017-10-03 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are no missing values in the given 96 points. However, we are to be cautious.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily pattern (with temperature variations during the day and night), we can consider a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal decomposition method or SARIMA. However, with only 4 days of data, the seasonality might be daily (24 points per season.\n\n 5. But note: the data starts at 2017-09-26 and ends at 2017-09-29. We are to forecast the next 4 days (from 2017-09-30 to 2017-10-03).\n\n 6. We must be cautious: the data shows a downward trend? Let's observe:\n    - The temperature fluctuates daily, but the overall level might be changing.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast, we can use a simple method that can capture the daily pattern and the recent trend.\n\n 8. Approach:\n    a. We can use a moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality. However, with only 4 days, we might not have enough seasonal cycles to fit a complex model.\n\n    b. Alternatively, we can use the average of each hour of the day from the available 4 days to form a daily profile, and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n    c. But note: the last day (2017-09-29) has a different pattern? We see that the temperature on 2017-09-29 is generally lower than the first day? \n\n    d. We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? However, that would ignore any trend.\n\n    e. Alternatively, we can use the last day's pattern and adjust by the difference between the previous days? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we can use a Seasonal Naive method: using the last day (2017-09-29) as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? But that would repeat the same day 4 times.\n\n    However, the data from 2017-09-26 to 2017-09-29 shows a downward trend? Let's check the average of each day:\n\n        2017-09-26: average = (14.14 + ... + 12.662) / 24 -> let's compute roughly: \n            We see values from 12 to 16 -> average around 14.5?\n        2017-09-27: from 6.261 to 14.351 -> average lower? \n        2017-09-28: from 5.839 to 15.547 -> average around 12?\n        2017-09-29: from 9.708 to 12.733 -> average around 11?\n\n    There is a downward trend? So we cannot simply repeat the last day.\n\n10. We can use a linear regression to detrend and then model the seasonality? But with only 4 days, the trend might not be linear.\n\n11. Alternatively, we can use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing with additive seasonality. The seasonality period is 24 (hourly data, daily season). We can use the last 4 days to fit the model and then forecast.\n\n    However, with only 4 days, the model might not be very stable.\n\n12. Given the time and the requirement, we will use a simple approach:\n\n    Step 1: Compute the daily average for each of the 4 days.\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-26): avg1\n        Day2 (2017-09-27): avg2\n        Day3 (2017-09-28): avg3\n        Day4 (2017-09-29): avg4\n\n    Step 2: Compute the trend: let's say the daily change. We can compute the average daily change: (avg4 - avg1) / 3.\n\n    Step 3: For the next 4 days, the daily average for day5 would be avg4 + (avg4-avg1)/3, day6: avg4 + 2*(avg4-avg1)/3, etc. But note: this might be too aggressive.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days to set the level and then project a linear trend? \n\n    However, we note that the data might be stabilizing? \n\n13. Another idea: use the average seasonal profile (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the level of the last day? \n\n    Steps:\n\n    a. Compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days: \n        h0_avg = (value at 00:00 of day1 + ... + day4) / 4\n        ... \n        h23_avg = ...\n\n    b. Then, compute the overall average of the entire 4 days: total_avg.\n\n    c. For the next day, we can set the level to the last day's average (avg4) and then adjust the seasonal profile by the difference between the overall average and the last day's average? \n\n        forecast_hour_i = h_i_avg + (avg4 - total_avg)\n\n    But this is additive adjustment.\n\n    d. Alternatively, multiplicative: but the data doesn't show multiplicative seasonality? \n\n    e. We can also use the last day's pattern and then adjust by the trend? \n\n14. We decide to use:\n\n    - Compute the daily averages:\n\n        day1: 2017-09-26: \n            values: [14.14, 15.898, 15.195, 15.969, 15.687, 15.758, 15.195, 15.054, 15.617, 16.25, 16.602, 16.602, 16.813, 16.391, 15.898, 16.813, 16.602, 15.336, 14.21, 12.522, 12.381, 12.029, 13.647, 12.662]\n            avg1 = sum(above)/24 = 15.25 (approx)\n\n        day2: 2017-09-27: \n            [12.733, 12.592, 12.24, 12.1, 13.436, 13.718, 14.351, 14.351, 13.507, 11.185, 11.467, 11.396, 12.381, 12.029, 11.115, 8.582, 8.09, 8.442, 9.849, 9.567, 9.919, 6.261, 6.613, 8.512]\n            avg2 = 11.15 (approx)\n\n        day3: 2017-09-28:\n            [8.723, 6.191, 5.839, 8.301, 8.16, 10.904, 11.678, 10.552, 12.24, 12.24, 13.014, 12.874, 11.607, 13.436, 13.366, 13.929, 14.773, 15.547, 13.507, 13.085, 12.874, 12.733, 13.085, 12.662]\n            avg3 = 11.65 (approx)\n\n        day4: 2017-09-29:\n            [12.029, 11.818, 10.904, 11.185, 11.396, 11.678, 11.044, 10.904, 10.693, 10.271, 10.693, 11.607, 11.044, 10.974, 11.185, 11.889, 12.381, 12.733, 12.733, 10.693, 11.537, 9.708, 9.989, 11.889]\n            avg4 = 11.3 (approx)\n\n    The overall average total_avg = (15.25+11.15+11.65+11.3)/4 = 12.3375\n\n    The daily averages (by hour) are computed by averaging the same hour across the 4 days.\n\n    Then for the next day (2017-09-30), we adjust the seasonal profile by: \n        forecast_i = h_i_avg + (avg4 - total_avg) \n        but note: we are going to forecast 4 days, so we need to project the level for each day.\n\n    However, we see a downward trend? The daily averages: 15.25, 11.15, 11.65, 11.3 -> the last two days are around 11.5. Maybe the trend has stabilized? \n\n    We can assume the level for the next 4 days is around 11.3? \n\n    But to be safe, we can use the last day's average (11.3) as the base and then use the seasonal pattern.\n\n    How to get the seasonal pattern? We can compute the relative deviations for each hour from the daily average for each day, then average these deviations? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour and then normalize by the overall average? \n\n    We do:\n\n        h0_avg = (14.14 + 12.733 + 8.723 + 12.029) / 4 = 11.906\n        h1_avg = (15.898 + 12.592 + 6.191 + 11.818) / 4 = 11.62475\n        ... \n\n    Then the seasonal index for hour0: h0_avg / total_avg? But we are using additive? \n\n    Since the data does not show multiplicative pattern (the amplitude doesn't grow with level? Actually, the level dropped and the amplitude also dropped? So additive might be better.\n\n    We can compute the additive seasonal component: for each hour, the average deviation from the daily mean.\n\n    But we have 4 days. For each day, we can compute:\n\n        day1: for hour0: 14.14 - avg1 = 14.14 - 15.25 = -1.11\n        day2: hour0: 12.733 - 11.15 = 1.583\n        ... \n\n    Then the seasonal component for hour0: average of (-1.11, 1.583, ...) \n\n    Then for the next day, we set the level (which is the daily average) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n    How to set the level for the next days? We can use the last day's average (11.3) for the first forecast day? And then for the next days, we can use the same level? Or we can project the trend? \n\n    The trend: from day1 to day4: 15.25 -> 11.3, so a drop of about 4 in 3 days -> about 1.33 per day. But then the next day we might expect 11.3 - 1.33 = 10? But the drop might not continue? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days: (11.65+11.3)/2 = 11.475, and then assume no trend? \n\n    Given the complexity and the fact that we don't have much data, we will assume the level for the last day (11.3) for the next 4 days? \n\n    Then the forecast for 2017-09-30 00:00:00 = level (11.3) + seasonal_component_hour0.\n\n    How to compute the seasonal_component_hour0?\n\n        We have for hour0 (00:00) of each day:\n\n            day1: 14.14 - 15.25 = -1.11\n            day2: 12.733 - 11.15 = 1.583\n            day3: 8.723 - 11.65 = -2.927\n            day4: 12.029 - 11.3 = 0.729\n\n        average = (-1.11 + 1.583 -2.927 + 0.729)/4 = (-1.725)/4 = -0.43125\n\n    Then forecast for 2017-09-30 00:00:00 = 11.3 + (-0.43125) = 10.86875\n\n    Similarly for the next hours.\n\n    But note: the seasonal component for hour0 is negative? That doesn't match the data? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for hour0 (11.906) and then subtract the overall average (12.3375) to get the seasonal component: 11.906 - 12.3375 = -0.4315 -> same as above.\n\n    So we can compute the seasonal component for each hour as: \n        s_i = h_i_avg - total_avg\n\n    Then the forecast for a particular hour i in the future (for any day in the forecast period) is:\n        base_level + s_i\n\n    But what base_level to use? We can use the last day's average? Or we can use the overall average? \n\n    Since the level has changed, we adjust by the last day's average? \n\n    Actually, we can set the base_level for the forecast period to the overall average? But that would ignore the recent drop.\n\n    We set the base_level to the last day's average? Then:\n\n        forecast_i = avg4 + s_i = 11.3 + (h_i_avg - total_avg)\n\n    But note: h_i_avg is the average of the 4 days for that hour, and total_avg is the average of all 96 points.\n\n    Alternatively, we can set the base_level to the overall average? Then we are just repeating the average pattern? \n\n    We want to capture the recent level. So:\n\n        forecast_i = (avg4) + (h_i_avg - total_avg)\n\n    But let's check: the average of the forecast for a day would be: \n        (1/24) * sum(forecast_i for i=0..23) = (1/24) * [ sum(h_i_avg) - 24*total_avg + 24*avg4 ] \n        But note: sum(h_i_avg) = 24 * total_avg? \n        total_avg = (sum of all data) / 96 = (sum of h_i_avg * 4) / 96 = (sum of h_i_avg) / 24 -> so sum(h_i_avg) = 24 * total_avg.\n\n        Therefore, the average of the forecast day = (1/24) * [24*total_avg - 24*total_avg + 24*avg4] = avg4.\n\n    So the daily average is avg4, which is what we want.\n\n    Therefore, we can compute:\n\n        For each hour i (0 to 23) in the day:\n            forecast_value = avg4 + (h_i_avg - total_avg)\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, we use the same pattern? \n\n    But note: we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same pattern for each day? \n\n    However, if we believe the level might change, we could adjust the level for the subsequent days by a trend? \n\n    Since we don't have a strong trend in the last two days (11.65 and 11.3) and the drop from day1 to day2 was big, we might assume the level is stable at around 11.3? \n\n    So we will use the same pattern for all 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        total_avg = (sum of all 96 points) / 96\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23):\n            h_i_avg = (value_day1_hour_i + value_day2_hour_i + value_day3_hour_i + value_day4_hour_i) / 4\n\n        Then for each day in the forecast period (4 days: 2017-09-30 to 2017-10-03) and for each hour in the day:\n            forecast = avg4 + (h_i_avg - total_avg)\n\n    But note: we must compute the exact total_avg and h_i_avg.\n\n    Let's compute total_avg:\n\n        We have 96 points. We can sum all the provided OT values and divide by 96.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        total_avg = (avg1*24 + avg2*24 + avg3*24 + avg4*24) / 96 = (avg1+avg2+avg3+avg4)/4\n\n    But we have the daily averages only approximately. We should compute exactly.\n\n    We'll compute:\n\n        total_sum = sum of all 96 OT values.\n\n    We can do this by code? But we are to do by hand? \n\n    Since the data is provided, we can calculate:\n\n        total_sum = \n        14.14+15.898+15.195+15.969+15.687+15.758+15.195+15.054+15.617+16.25+16.602+16.602+16.813+16.391+15.898+16.813+16.602+15.336+14.21+12.522+12.381+12.029+13.647+12.662+   # day1\n        12.733+12.592+12.24+12.1+13.436+13.718+14.351+14.351+13.507+11.185+11.467+11.396+12.381+12.029+11.115+8.582+8.09+8.442+9.849+9.567+9.919+6.261+6.613+8.512+   # day2\n        8.723+6.191+5.839+8.301+8.16+10.904+11.678+10.552+12.24+12.24+13.014+12.874+11.607+13.436+13.366+13.929+14.773+15.547+13.507+13.085+12.874+12.733+13.085+12.662+   # day3\n        12.029+11.818+10.904+11.185+11.396+11.678+11.044+10.904+10.693+10.271+10.693+11.607+11.044+10.974+11.185+11.889+12.381+12.733+12.733+10.693+11.537+9.708+9.989+11.889   # day4\n\n    We can compute step by step? \n\n    Alternatively, we can write a small script, but since we are to provide the answer, we can do:\n\n        total_sum = 14.14+15.898+15.195+15.969+15.687+15.758+15.195+15.054+15.617+16.25+16.602+16.602+16.813+16.391+15.898+16.813+16.602+15.336+14.21+12.522+12.381+12.029+13.647+12.662\n        +12.733+12.592+12.24+12.1+13.436+13.718+14.351+14.351+13.507+11.185+11.467+11.396+12.381+12.029+11.115+8.582+8.09+8.442+9.849+9.567+9.919+6.261+6.613+8.512\n        +8.723+6.191+5.839+8.301+8.16+10.904+11.678+10.552+12.24+12.24+13.014+12.874+11.607+13.436+13.366+13.929+14.773+15.547+13.507+13.085+12.874+12.733+13.085+12.662\n        +12.029+11.818+10.904+11.185+11.396+11.678+11.044+10.904+10.693+10.271+10.693+11.607+11.044+10.974+11.185+11.889+12.381+12.733+12.733+10.693+11.537+9.708+9.989+11.889\n\n    We can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n            Let's add: \n                14.14+15.898 = 30.038\n                +15.195 = 45.233\n                +15.969 = 61.202\n                +15.687 = 76.889\n                +15.758 = 92.647\n                +15.195 = 107.842\n                +15.054 = 122.896\n                +15.617 = 138.513\n                +16.25 = 154.763\n                +16.602 = 171.365\n                +16.602 = 187.967\n                +16.813 = 204.78\n                +16.391 = 221.171\n                +15.898 = 237.069\n                +16.813 = 253.882\n                +16.602 = 270.484\n                +15.336 = 285.82\n                +14.21 = 300.03\n                +12.522 = 312.552\n                +12.381 = 324.933\n                +12.029 = 336.962\n                +13.647 = 350.609\n                +12.662 = 363.271\n\n        Day2:\n            12.733+12.592 = 25.325\n            +12.24 = 37.565\n            +12.1 = 49.665\n            +13.436 = 63.101\n            +13.718 = 76.819\n            +14.351 = 91.17\n            +14.351 = 105.521\n            +13.507 = 119.028\n            +11.185 = 130.213\n            +11.467 = 141.68\n            +11.396 = 153.076\n            +12.381 = 165.457\n            +12.029 = 177.486\n            +11.115 = 188.601\n            +8.582 = 197.183\n            +8.09 = 205.273\n            +8.442 = 213.715\n            +9.849 = 223.564\n            +9.567 = 233.131\n            +9.919 = 243.05\n            +6.261 = 249.311\n            +6.613 = 255.924\n            +8.512 = 264.436\n\n        Day3:\n            8.723+6.191 = 14.914\n            +5.839 = 20.753\n            +8.301 = 29.054\n            +8.16 = 37.214\n            +10.904 = 48.118\n            +11.678 = 59.796\n            +10.552 = 70.348\n            +12.24 = 82.588\n            +12.24 = 94.828\n            +13.014 = 107.842\n            +12.874 = 120.716\n            +11.607 = 132.323\n            +13.436 = 145.759\n            +13.366 = 159.125\n            +13.929 = 173.054\n            +14.773 = 187.827\n            +15.547 = 203.374\n            +13.507 = 216.881\n            +13.085 = 229.966\n            +12.874 = 242.84\n            +12.733 = 255.573\n            +13.085 = 268.658\n            +12.662 = 281.32\n\n        Day4:\n            12.029+11.818 = 23.847\n            +10.904 = 34.751\n            +11.185 = 45.936\n            +11.396 = 57.332\n            +11.678 = 69.01\n            +11.044 = 80.054\n            +10.904 = 90.958\n            +10.693 = 101.651\n            +10.271 = 111.922\n            +10.693 = 122.615\n            +11.607 = 134.222\n            +11.044 = 145.266\n            +10.974 = 156.24\n            +11.185 = 167.425\n            +11.889 = 179.314\n            +12.381 = 191.695\n            +12.733 = 204.428\n            +12.733 = 217.161\n            +10.693 = 227.854\n            +11.537 = 239.391\n            +9.708 = 249.099\n            +9.989 = 259.088\n            +11.889 = 270.977\n\n        Total_sum = 363.271 + 264.436 + 281.32 + 270.977 = 1179.004\n\n        Let me double-check: \n            363.271 + 264.436 = 627.707\n            627.707 + 281.32 = 909.027\n            909.027 + 270.977 = 1180.004?  -> wait, 909.027+270.977=1180.004?

But we are not accounting for it. \n\n    This is a simple method. \n\n    We must provide the complete data for 96 points.\n\n    Let's write the forecast in the required format.\n\n    We'll round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places.\n\n    But note: the original data had up to 3 decimal places, but we have computed with more precision. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n    Alternatively, we can keep the same precision? The original had 3 decimal places? Actually, some had 3, some had 2? \n\n    We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n    Example: 10.90525 -> 10.905\n\n    But note: 10.90525 rounded to 3 decimals: 10.905? But the original had 3 decimal places? \n\n    Actually, the original data had 3 decimal places? \n\n        e.g., 14.140000 -> 14.140, 15.898000 -> 15.898\n\n    So we can output 3 decimal places.\n\n    We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n    But note: the computation might be off by floating point.
