        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-07-12 00:00:00 to 2017-07-15 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values in general. However, for forecasting, we are only given the 96 points without gaps. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. Since the data is hourly and shows a daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement for a complete forecast, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has negative values, so we cannot use multiplicative seasonality that requires positive data? Actually, Holt-Winters additive method can handle negative values.\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need to forecast 4 days, we might face challenges. But we can still proceed.\n\n 6. We'll use an automated approach to select the best model parameters? But since we are not running actual code, we have to simulate the forecast.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - The data shows a clear daily pattern: \n        * During the night (00:00 to 06:00) the values are relatively high (around 7-12)\n        * Then in the morning (07:00-10:00) they drop (even to negative)\n        * Then during the day (10:00-16:00) they are negative or low\n        * Then in the evening (17:00-23:00) they rise again.\n\n 8. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n    The last 4 days: \n        2017-07-12: starts at 8.386 and ends at 12.366\n        2017-07-13: starts at 11.549 and ends at 11.051\n        2017-07-14: starts at 12.722 and ends at 8.635\n        2017-07-15: starts at 7.853 and ends at 12.153\n\n    The starting points: 8.386, 11.549, 12.722, 7.853 -> no clear trend.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-07-15) as a template and adjust by the average change from the previous days? But without a clear trend, we might just use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 10. Steps for average method:\n      - Group by hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n 11. But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We only have 4 days (Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). The next 96 hours would be from Sunday (2017-07-16) to Wednesday (2017-07-19). However, we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality (only one week? and only 4 days). So we stick to daily.\n\n 12. However, the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days? Actually, the user provided only 96 points (4 days) for forecasting. So we must base our forecast on these 4 days.\n\n 13. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00:00: [8.386, 11.549, 12.722, 7.853] -> (8.386+11.549+12.722+7.853)/4 = 10.1275\n      Hour 01:00: [6.894, 11.336, 12.402, 9.204] -> (6.894+11.336+12.402+9.204)/4 = 9.959\n      ... and so on.\n\n 14. Then we repeat this pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 15. But note: the data might have a trend? We can check the overall average of each day:\n\n        Day1 (2017-07-12): average = (8.386+6.894+...+12.366)/24 -> we don't need to compute exactly, but visually:\n        Day1: starts at 8.386, then drops to negative in the day, then rises to 12.366.\n        Similarly for the other days.\n\n        The daily averages might be:\n          Day1: let's compute: \n            positive hours: 00-06: 8.386,6.894,7.32,7.676,7.071,7.995,5.543 -> about 7.0\n            negative hours: 07-16: 3.802,1.919,-0.071,-14.072,-8.066,-18.372,-5.615,-14.889,-9.843,-7.071 -> about -5.0\n            positive: 17-23: -0.497,3.98,6.219,8.777,10.518,11.158,12.366 -> about 7.5\n            total average: (7*7.0 + 10*(-5.0) + 7*7.5)/24 = (49 -50 +52.5)/24 = 51.5/24 \u2248 2.15\n\n        Similarly, Day2: \n          We can see the values are generally higher? But let's not compute exactly.\n\n        Actually, we are only going to use the hourly average.\n\n 16. However, the average method might smooth out the pattern and not capture the last day's deviation? But without a clear trend, it's a safe method.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-07-15) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have 4 days to forecast, so we can use the last 4 days? But that would be the same as the past 4 days? \n\n 18. Since the problem does not specify the model and we are to provide a complete forecast, we choose the average method.\n\n 19. Steps:\n\n      a) Extract the hour of the day for each record.\n      b) Group by hour (ignoring the day) and compute the mean.\n\n      We have 4 values for each hour (from 4 days). We take the mean.\n\n 20. Then we generate the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00) by repeating the 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n 21. But note: the starting point of the forecast is the next day after 2017-07-15 23:00:00, which is 2017-07-16 00:00:00.\n\n 22. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00: (8.386, 11.549, 12.722, 7.853) -> 10.1275\n      Hour 01: (6.894, 11.336, 12.402, 9.204) -> (6.894+11.336+12.402+9.204)/4 = 9.959\n      Hour 02: (7.320, 10.554, 11.691, 9.168) -> (7.320+10.554+11.691+9.168)/4 = 9.68325\n      Hour 03: (7.676, 9.630, 11.584, 8.671) -> (7.676+9.630+11.584+8.671)/4 = 9.39025\n      Hour 04: (7.071, 9.879, 10.163, 7.960) -> (7.071+9.879+10.163+7.960)/4 = 8.76825\n      Hour 05: (7.995, 9.488, 9.985, 7.000) -> (7.995+9.488+9.985+7.000)/4 = 8.617\n      Hour 06: (5.543, 7.853, 7.711, 6.290) -> (5.543+7.853+7.711+6.290)/4 = 6.84925\n      Hour 07: (3.802, 5.970, 8.138, 3.909) -> (3.802+5.970+8.138+3.909)/4 = 5.45475\n      Hour 08: (1.919, 1.848, 4.904, -2.168) -> (1.919+1.848+4.904-2.168)/4 = 1.62575\n      Hour 09: (-0.071, -0.959, 2.878, -1.670) -> (-0.071-0.959+2.878-1.670)/4 = 0.0445\n      Hour 10: (-14.072, -0.924, 2.843, -3.980) -> (-14.072-0.924+2.843-3.980)/4 = -4.03325\n      Hour 11: (-8.066, -5.543, -1.031, -3.909) -> (-8.066-5.543-1.031-3.909)/4 = -4.63725\n      Hour 12: (-18.372, -0.746, -7.427, -14.214) -> (-18.372-0.746-7.427-14.214)/4 = -10.18975\n      Hour 13: (-5.615, -5.259, -14.250, -13.859) -> (-5.615-5.259-14.250-13.859)/4 = -9.74575\n      Hour 14: (-14.889, -5.046, -11.762, -11.336) -> (-14.889-5.046-11.762-11.336)/4 = -10.75825\n      Hour 15: (-9.843, -2.132, -6.219, -8.457) -> (-9.843-2.132-6.219-8.457)/4 = -6.66275\n      Hour 16: (-7.071, 0.391, -5.224, -5.188) -> (-7.071+0.391-5.224-5.188)/4 = -4.273\n      Hour 17: (-0.497, -1.599, 5.188, -0.071) -> (-0.497-1.599+5.188-0.071)/4 = 0.75525\n      Hour 18: (3.980, 4.868, 5.721, 4.548) -> (3.980+4.868+5.721+4.548)/4 = 4.77925\n      Hour 19: (6.219, 6.503, 7.214, 7.178) -> (6.219+6.503+7.214+7.178)/4 = 6.7785\n      Hour 20: (8.777, 9.097, 9.381, 10.056) -> (8.777+9.097+9.381+10.056)/4 = 9.32775\n      Hour 21: (10.518, 9.985, 8.457, 10.021) -> (10.518+9.985+8.457+10.021)/4 = 9.74525\n      Hour 22: (11.158, 10.234, 9.630, 11.300) -> (11.158+10.234+9.630+11.300)/4 = 10.5805\n      Hour 23: (12.366, 11.051, 8.635, 12.153) -> (12.366+11.051+8.635+12.153)/4 = 11.05125\n\n 23. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day1: 2017-07-16 00:00:00 to 2017-07-16 23:00:00: \n          00:00: 10.1275\n          01:00: 9.959\n          ... until 23:00: 11.05125\n\n      Day2: 2017-07-17 00:00:00 to 2017-07-17 23:00:00: same 24 values\n      Day3: 2017-07-18 00:00:00 to 2017-07-18 23:00:00: same\n      Day4: 2017-07-19 00:00:00 to 2017-07-19 23:00:00: same\n\n 24. We round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimals. So we round the averages to 3 decimals.\n\n 25. Let's round:\n\n      Hour00: 10.128 -> 10.128 (but we'll keep as 10.1275 -> 10.128? Actually, let's compute exactly and round to 3 decimals.\n\n      We'll recalc and round each:\n\n        Hour00: (8.386+11.549+12.722+7.853)/4 = 40.51/4 = 10.1275 -> 10.128\n        But note: 8.1275 rounded to 3 decimals is 10.128? Actually, 10.1275 is exactly halfway, so we round to even? But typically in such contexts, we round to 3 decimals by standard rounding.\n\n        We'll do: \n          10.1275 -> 10.128\n          9.959 -> 9.959 (since 9.959 is 9.959, so 9.959)\n\n      However, we can use the exact value and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use the exact average and then format to 3 decimals.\n\n 27. We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n      Hour00: 10.1275 -> 10.128\n      Hour01: 9.959 -> 9.959\n      But wait: 6.894+11.336+12.402+9.204 = 39.836 -> 39.836/4=9.959 -> exactly 9.959 -> 9.959\n\n      Hour02: 7.320+10.554+11.691+9.168 = 38.733 -> 38.733/4=9.68325 -> 9.683\n      Hour03: 7.676+9.630+11.584+8.671 = 37.561 -> 37.561/4=9.39025 -> 9.390\n      Hour04: 7.071+9.879+10.163+7.960 = 35.073 -> 35.073/4=8.76825 -> 8.768\n      Hour05: 7.995+9.488+9.985+7.000 = 34.468 -> 34.468/4=8.617 -> 8.617\n      Hour06: 5.543+7.853+7.711+6.290 = 27.397 -> 27.397/4=6.84925 -> 6.849\n      Hour07: 3.802+5.970+8.138+3.909 = 21.819 -> 21.819/4=5.45475 -> 5.455\n      Hour08: 1.919+1.848+4.904-2.168 = 6.503 -> 6.503/4=1.62575 -> 1.626\n      Hour09: -0.071-0.959+2.878-1.670 = 0.178 -> 0.178/4=0.0445 -> 0.044 (or 0.045? 0.0445 rounds to 0.044? \n          Actually, 0.0445: the digit after 4 is 5, so we round up the last digit: 0.045? \n          But the rule: if exactly 5, then round to the nearest even. 0.0445: the last digit is 4 (even) and we are adding 0.0005 -> then we round to 0.044? \n          However, in many systems, 0.0445 is rounded to 0.045. Let me check: \n          The number is 0.0445. The digit in the thousandths place is 4 and the next is 5, so we round up the 4 to 5? \n          Actually, the rule: look at the digit after the one you are rounding to. If it's 5 or more, round up. \n          So 0.0445: \n            - The thousandths place is the third digit: 4 (in 0.044) and the next digit is 5 -> so we round up the 4 to 5 -> 0.045.\n\n          Therefore, 0.0445 -> 0.045.\n\n      Hour10: (-14.072-0.924+2.843-3.980) = -16.133 -> -16.133/4 = -4.03325 -> -4.033\n      Hour11: (-8.066-5.543-1.031-3.909) = -18.549 -> -18.549/4 = -4.63725 -> -4.637\n      Hour12: (-18.372-0.746-7.427-14.214) = -40.759 -> -40.759/4 = -10.18975 -> -10.190\n      Hour13: (-5.615-5.259-14.250-13.859) = -38.983 -> -38.983/4 = -9.74575 -> -9.746\n      Hour14: (-14.889-5.046-11.762-11.336) = -43.033 -> -43.033/4 = -10.75825 -> -10.758\n      Hour15: (-9.843-2.132-6.219-8.457) = -26.651 -> -26.651/4 = -6.66275 -> -6.663\n      Hour16: (-7.071+0.391-5.224-5.188) = -17.092 -> -17.092/4 = -4.273 -> -4.273\n      Hour17: (-0.497-1.599+5.188-0.071) = 3.021 -> 3.021/4 = 0.75525 -> 0.755\n      Hour18: (3.980+4.868+5.721+4.548) = 19.117 -> 19.117/4 = 4.77925 -> 4.779\n      Hour19: (6.219+6.503+7.214+7.178) = 27.114 -> 27.114/4 = 6.7785 -> 6.779\n      Hour20: (8.777+9.097+9.381+10.056) = 37.311 -> 37.311/4 = 9.32775 -> 9.328\n      Hour21: (10.518+9.985+8.457+10.021) = 38.981 -> 38.981/4 = 9.74525 -> 9.745\n      Hour22: (11.158+10.234+9.630+11.300) = 42.322 -> 42.322/4 = 10.5805 -> 10.581\n      because 0.5805: the thousandths digit is 0, and the next is 5 -> round up the 0 to 1? Actually, we are at the third decimal: \n          10.5805: \n            - the digit in the thousandths place is 0, and the next is 5 -> we round up the 0?

So we use the same pattern.\n\n 31. We generate the next 96 points:\n\n      Start: 2017-07-16 00:00:00\n      End: 2017-07-19 23:00:00\n\n 32. Format: \n        date and time in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n        and the MUFL value rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 33. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n 34. Note: the original data had negative values and we have negative values in the forecast.\n\n 35. We output the data in the same structure.\n\n 36. Let's write the first 24 hours (first day) and then the next days similarly.\n\n 37. We must be cautious: the date increases by one day after 23:00:00.\n\n 38. We'll generate:\n\n        date                  MUFL\n        2017-07-16 00:00:00  10.128\n        2017-07-16 01:00:00   9.959\n        ... \n        2017-07-16 23:00:00  11.051\n        2017-07-17 00:00:00  10.128\n        ... and so on.\n\n 39. We have 4 days * 24 = 96 records.\n\n 40. We output in the required XML-like format.\n\n 41. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 42. We'll write the data in the answer block.\n\n 43. However, note: the original data had 3 decimal places, and we are rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n 44. Let's do it.\n\n 45. We'll list the 96 records.\n\n 46. We have the 24 averages (rounded) as:\n\n        h00: 10.128\n        h01: 9.959\n        h02: 9.683\n        h03: 9.390\n        h04: 8.768\n        h05: 8.617\n        h06: 6.849\n        h07: 5.455\n        h08: 1.626\n        h09: 0.045\n        h10: -4.033\n        h11: -4.637\n        h12: -10.190\n        h13: -9.746\n        h14: -10.758\n        h15: -6.663\n        h16: -4.273\n        h17: 0.755\n        h18: 4.779\n        h19: 6.779\n        h20: 9.328\n        h21: 9.745\n        h22: 10.581\n        h23: 11.051\n\n 47. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n      Day1: 2017-07-16\n      Day2: 2017-07-17\n      Day3: 2017-07-18\n      Day4: 2017-07-19\n\n 48. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n               date    MUFL\n        2017-07-16 00:00:00  10.128\n        2017-07-16 01:00:00   9.959\n        2017-07-16 02:00:00   9.683\n        2017-07-16 03:00:00   9.390\n        2017-07-16 04:00:00   8.768\n        2017-07-16 05:00:00   8.617\n        2017-07-16 06:00:00   6.849\n        2017-07-16 07:00:00   5.455\n        2017-07-16 08:00:00   1.626\n        2017-07-16 09:00:00   0.045\n        2017-07-16 10:00:00  -4.033\n        2017-07-16 11:00:00  -4.637\n        2017-07-16 12:00:00 -10.190\n        2017-07-16 13:00:00  -9.746\n        2017-07-16 14:00:00 -10.758\n        2017-07-16 15:00:00  -6.663\n        2017-07-16 16:00:00  -4.273\n        2017-07-16 17:00:00   0.755\n        2017-07-16 18:00:00   4.779\n        2017-07-16 19:00:00   6.779\n        2017-07-16 20:00:00   9.328\n        2017-07-16 21:00:00   9.745\n        2017-07-16 22:00:00  10.581\n        2017-07-16 23:00:00  11.051\n        2017-07-17 00:00:00  10.128\n        2017-07-17 01:00:00   9.959\n        ... and so on for 3 more days.\n\n 49. We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 50. But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must not omit any.\n\n 51. We'll generate the next 96 records.\n\n 52. We note that the pattern repeats every 24 hours.\n\n 53. We output in the same style as the input: two columns, space separated? The input had:\n\n        \"               date    MUFL\"\n        \"2017-07-12 00:00:00   8.386\"\n\n    Actually, the input had the date and time in one column and then the MUFL value. And the date-time is left-padded? Actually, the example had:\n\n        \"2017-07-12 00:00:00   8.386\"\n\n    So we output without the leading spaces.\n\n 54. We'll write:\n\n        [date] [space] [time] [space] [MUFL value]\n\n    But note: the example had the date and time in one string? Actually, the example had:\n\n        \"2017-07-12 00:00:00   8.386\"\n\n    So we output:\n\n        \"2017-07-16 00:00:00  10.128\"\n\n    We'll align the decimals? But the problem does not require alignment, just the data.\n\n 55. We output the 96 records.\n\n 56. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 57. Note: the problem says \"Please obey the format strictly\".\n\n 58. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-07-16 00:00:00  10.128\n        2017-07-16 01:00:00   9.959\n        ... \n        ... until 2017-07-19 23:00:00  11.051\n        </answer>\n\n 59. But note: the example input had a header? But the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning just the data rows? \n\n    The example input had:\n\n        \"               date    MUFL\"\n        then the data.\n\n    But we are only to output the data rows? The problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and the example input had 96 rows without header? Actually, the example input had 96 rows of data.\n\n    So we output 96 rows without header.\n\n 60. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-07-16 00:00:00  10.128\n        2017-07-16 01:00:00   9.959\n        ... \n        2017-07-19 23:00:00  11.051\n        </answer>\n\n 61. We'll generate the entire 96 rows.\n\n 62. We note: the next day after 2017-07-15 is 2017-07-16.\n\n 63. We write the code to generate the dates? But we are not coding, we are writing the data.\n\n 64. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 65. But note: the problem says \"You are an expert\", so we are expected to provide the data.\n\n 66. We'll write the data in the answer block.\n\n 67. However, 96 lines is long, but we must provide.\n\n 68. We do it.\n\n 69. We have the 24 values for one day, and we repeat 4 days.\n\n 70. We list:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-16: [10.128, 9.959, 9.683, 9.390, 8.768, 8.617, 6.849, 5.455, 1.626, 0.045, -4.033, -4.637, -10.190, -9.746, -10.758, -6.663, -4.273, 0.755, 4.779, 6.779, 9.328, 9.745, 10.581, 11.051]\n        Day2: 2017-07-17: same list\n        Day3: 2017-07-18: same\n        Day4: 2017-07-19: same\n\n 71. We write the 96 lines.\n\n 72. We must be cautious: the date increases by one day at 00:00:00.\n\n 73. We write:\n\n        Line1: 2017-07-16 00:00:00  10.128\n        Line2: 2017-07-16 01:00:00   9.959\n        ...\n        Line24: 2017-07-16 23:00:00  11.051\n        Line25: 2017-07-17 00:00:00  10.128\n        ...\n        Line48: 2017-07-17 23:00:00  11.051\n        Line49: 2017-07-18 00:00:00  10.128\n        ...\n        Line72: 2017-07-18 23:00:00  11.051\n        Line73: 2017-07-19 00:00:00  10.128\n        ...\n        Line96: 2017-07-19 23:00:00  11.051\n\n 74. We output.\n\n 75. Note: the values for the same hour in different days are the same? Yes, because we are using the average.\n\n 76. We write the answer.\n",
