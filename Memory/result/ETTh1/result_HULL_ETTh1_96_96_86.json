        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are no explicit missing entries in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. But the provided 96 points seem complete? \n    Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", we must be cautious. But the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. The last timestamp is 2017-06-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from \n    2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n 3. We must choose a method for forecasting. Since we are dealing with time series and we have hourly data, we can consider:\n    - The data shows daily seasonality (24 hours) and also some patterns (like lower values at night, higher during the day?).\n    - However, looking at the data, the pattern is not very clear. For example, on 2017-06-10, we see zeros at night, but on other days negative values.\n\n 4. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a complete forecast, we can use a simple method that captures:\n    - The overall level, trend, and seasonality.\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components. But with only 4 days (96 points) it's a bit short for a strong seasonal model.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. The frequency is 24 (hourly data with daily seasonality).\n\n 7. However, note that the data has negative values? So we must be cautious with models that assume positive data.\n\n 8. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n    - Create a time series object with frequency=24.\n    - Use an exponential smoothing model (ETS) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components.\n\n 9. But since we are not coding and must provide the forecast, we have to simulate the process.\n\n 10. Given the constraints, we can do:\n     - We'll use a simple average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days of data.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2017-06-13) as a template and adjust by the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 12. However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any? \n     So we assume the provided 96 points are complete and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 13. We decide to use a simple method: \n     - We'll take the average of each hour across the 4 days we have to form a daily profile, then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n 14. Steps for the method:\n      - Group the data by hour of the day (so 0,1,...,23) and compute the average for each hour.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-06-14 to 2017-06-17), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 15. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n      Day 1 (2017-06-10): average = (2.076+0.938+...+0.737)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n          We see a lot of zeros at night and then positive during the day. \n          We can compute: \n          Day1: [2.076,0.938,0.603,1.541,1.474,1.072,1.808,2.21,1.808,1.942,2.746,2.076,1.273,1.942,2.143,1.407,1.273,0.938,0,0,0,0,0.067,0.737] \n          Sum = about 30.5 -> average ~ 1.27\n      Day2: [1.608,1.34,1.541,1.206,0.603,0.67,2.009,1.206,2.009,1.942,1.808,2.009,1.875,1.273,2.478,0.603,0.536,0.134,-0.268,-0.536,-0.536,-0.536,0.201,0.402]\n          Sum = about 20.5 -> average ~ 0.85\n      Day3: [2.21,1.808,1.875,0.938,1.474,1.942,0.938,1.674,1.608,2.813,3.215,2.411,2.344,1.875,2.679,3.483,1.608,0.804,-0.804,-0.201,0.268,0.067,0.603,1.608]\n          Sum = about 38.5 -> average ~ 1.60\n      Day4: [1.942,1.808,2.143,1.407,2.009,1.808,2.411,2.746,2.277,2.143,2.612,1.541,1.34,1.674,1.674,1.541,1.34,0.737,-0.536,0.067,0,-0.469,-0.201,-0.134]\n          Sum = about 30.5 -> average ~ 1.27\n\n     There is no clear trend? So using the average per hour might be acceptable.\n\n 16. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (2.076 + 1.608 + 2.21 + 1.942) / 4 = (2.076+1.608+2.21+1.942)/4 = 7.836/4 = 1.959\n     Hour 1: (0.938+1.34+1.808+1.808)/4 = (0.938+1.34+1.808+1.808)=5.894/4=1.4735\n     ... and so on.\n\n 17. But note: the last day (2017-06-13) has negative values at some hours? We are averaging and that's okay.\n\n 18. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 19. However, we must be cautious: the problem says the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing? \n     So we use the provided 4 days to compute the hourly averages.\n\n 20. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     Hour 0: [2.076, 1.608, 2.210, 1.942] -> average = (2.076+1.608+2.210+1.942)/4 = 7.836/4 = 1.959\n     Hour 1: [0.938, 1.340, 1.808, 1.808] -> (0.938+1.340+1.808+1.808)=5.894/4=1.4735\n     Hour 2: [0.603, 1.541, 1.875, 2.143] -> (0.603+1.541+1.875+2.143)=6.162/4=1.5405\n     Hour 3: [1.541, 1.206, 0.938, 1.407] -> (1.541+1.206+0.938+1.407)=5.092/4=1.273\n     Hour 4: [1.474, 0.603, 1.474, 2.009] -> (1.474+0.603+1.474+2.009)=5.56/4=1.39\n     Hour 5: [1.072, 0.670, 1.942, 1.808] -> (1.072+0.670+1.942+1.808)=5.492/4=1.373\n     Hour 6: [1.808, 2.009, 0.938, 2.411] -> (1.808+2.009+0.938+2.411)=7.166/4=1.7915\n     Hour 7: [2.210, 1.206, 1.674, 2.746] -> (2.210+1.206+1.674+2.746)=7.836/4=1.959\n     Hour 8: [1.808, 2.009, 1.608, 2.277] -> (1.808+2.009+1.608+2.277)=7.702/4=1.9255\n     Hour 9: [1.942, 1.942, 2.813, 2.143] -> (1.942+1.942+2.813+2.143)=8.84/4=2.21\n     Hour 10: [2.746, 1.808, 3.215, 2.612] -> (2.746+1.808+3.215+2.612)=10.381/4=2.59525\n     Hour 11: [2.076, 2.009, 2.411, 1.541] -> (2.076+2.009+2.411+1.541)=8.037/4=2.00925\n     Hour 12: [1.273, 1.875, 2.344, 1.340] -> (1.273+1.875+2.344+1.340)=6.832/4=1.708\n     Hour 13: [1.942, 1.273, 1.875, 1.674] -> (1.942+1.273+1.875+1.674)=6.764/4=1.691\n     Hour 14: [2.143, 2.478, 2.679, 1.674] -> (2.143+2.478+2.679+1.674)=8.974/4=2.2435\n     Hour 15: [1.407, 0.603, 3.483, 1.541] -> (1.407+0.603+3.483+1.541)=7.034/4=1.7585\n     Hour 16: [1.273, 0.536, 1.608, 1.340] -> (1.273+0.536+1.608+1.340)=4.757/4=1.18925\n     Hour 17: [0.938, 0.134, 0.804, 0.737] -> (0.938+0.134+0.804+0.737)=2.613/4=0.65325\n     Hour 18: [0.000, -0.268, -0.804, -0.536] -> (0-0.268-0.804-0.536)/4 = -1.608/4 = -0.402\n     Hour 19: [0.000, -0.536, -0.201, 0.067] -> (0-0.536-0.201+0.067)/4 = -0.67/4 = -0.1675\n     Hour 20: [0.000, -0.536, 0.268, 0.000] -> (0-0.536+0.268+0)/4 = -0.268/4 = -0.067\n     Hour 21: [0.000, -0.536, 0.067, -0.469] -> (0-0.536+0.067-0.469)/4 = -0.938/4 = -0.2345\n     Hour 22: [0.067, 0.201, 0.603, -0.201] -> (0.067+0.201+0.603-0.201)/4 = 0.67/4 = 0.1675\n     Hour 23: [0.737, 0.402, 1.608, -0.134] -> (0.737+0.402+1.608-0.134)/4 = 2.613/4 = 0.65325\n\n 21. Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating the above 24 averages for 4 times.\n\n 22. The next 96 timestamps start from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n 23. We generate the dates:\n      Start: 2017-06-14 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-06-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n 24. The HULL for each hour is the average we computed for that hour.\n\n 25. We write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'HULL'\n\n 26. We must output exactly 96 rows.\n\n 27. Let's write the first day (2017-06-14) as the 24 averages in order, then the same for 2017-06-15, 2017-06-16, 2017-06-17.\n\n 28. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 29. Note: We are rounding the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 30. The computed averages (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n     Hour0: 1.959\n     Hour1: 1.474 (1.4735 rounded to 3 decimals is 1.474)\n        We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n     Let's recalc with rounding to 3 decimals at the end of the average:\n\n     Hour0: (2.076+1.608+2.210+1.942)/4 = 7.836/4 = 1.959\n     Hour1: (0.938+1.340+1.808+1.808)/4 = 5.894/4 = 1.4735 -> 1.474\n     Hour2: (0.603+1.541+1.875+2.143)/4 = 6.162/4 = 1.5405 -> 1.541\n     Hour3: (1.541+1.206+0.938+1.407)/4 = 5.092/4 = 1.273\n     Hour4: (1.474+0.603+1.474+2.009)/4 = 5.56/4 = 1.390\n     Hour5: (1.072+0.670+1.942+1.808)/4 = 5.492/4 = 1.373\n     Hour6: (1.808+2.009+0.938+2.411)/4 = 7.166/4 = 1.7915 -> 1.792\n     Hour7: (2.210+1.206+1.674+2.746)/4 = 7.836/4 = 1.959\n     Hour8: (1.808+2.009+1.608+2.277)/4 = 7.702/4 = 1.9255 -> 1.926\n     Hour9: (1.942+1.942+2.813+2.143)/4 = 8.84/4 = 2.210\n     Hour10: (2.746+1.808+3.215+2.612)/4 = 10.381/4 = 2.59525 -> 2.595\n     Hour11: (2.076+2.009+2.411+1.541)/4 = 8.037/4 = 2.00925 -> 2.009\n     Hour12: (1.273+1.875+2.344+1.340)/4 = 6.832/4 = 1.708\n     Hour13: (1.942+1.273+1.875+1.674)/4 = 6.764/4 = 1.691\n     Hour14: (2.143+2.478+2.679+1.674)/4 = 8.974/4 = 2.2435 -> 2.244\n     Hour15: (1.407+0.603+3.483+1.541)/4 = 7.034/4 = 1.7585 -> 1.759\n     Hour16: (1.273+0.536+1.608+1.340)/4 = 4.757/4 = 1.18925 -> 1.189\n     Hour17: (0.938+0.134+0.804+0.737)/4 = 2.613/4 = 0.65325 -> 0.653\n     Hour18: (0.000-0.268-0.804-0.536)/4 = (-1.608)/4 = -0.402\n     Hour19: (0.000-0.536-0.201+0.067)/4 = (-0.67)/4 = -0.1675 -> -0.168\n     Hour20: (0.000-0.536+0.268+0.000)/4 = (-0.268)/4 = -0.067\n     Hour21: (0.000-0.536+0.067-0.469)/4 = (-0.938)/4 = -0.2345 -> -0.235\n     Hour22: (0.067+0.201+0.603-0.201)/4 = 0.67/4 = 0.1675 -> 0.168\n     Hour23: (0.737+0.402+1.608-0.134)/4 = 2.613/4 = 0.65325 -> 0.653\n\n 31. Now we create the next 96 points:\n\n     Day1: 2017-06-14\n        00:00:00 -> 1.959\n        01:00:00 -> 1.474\n        02:00:00 -> 1.541\n        03:00:00 -> 1.273\n        04:00:00 -> 1.390\n        05:00:00 -> 1.373\n        06:00:00 -> 1.792\n        07:00:00 -> 1.959\n        08:00:00 -> 1.926\n        09:00:00 -> 2.210\n        10:00:00 -> 2.595\n        11:00:00 -> 2.009\n        12:00:00 -> 1.708\n        13:00:00 -> 1.691\n        14:00:00 -> 2.244\n        15:00:00 -> 1.759\n        16:00:00 -> 1.189\n        17:00:00 -> 0.653\n        18:00:00 -> -0.402\n        19:00:00 -> -0.168\n        20:00:00 -> -0.067\n        21:00:00 -> -0.235\n        22:00:00 -> 0.168\n        23:00:00 -> 0.653\n\n     Then repeat the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 32. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 33. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 34. We output the data in the answer block.\n\n 35. We note that the method is very simple and might not capture trends or changing patterns, but with only 4 days of data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 36. We generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n Let's write the data:\n",
