        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-27 00:00:00 to 2017-04-30 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) variable.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. But for forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the input? Actually, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points are complete. So we assume the given 96 points are complete and we are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we have to generate 96 rows of data (with the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted HULL values).\n\n 4. Since we are an expert in time series forecasting, we can choose an appropriate model. Given the data is hourly and we have only 96 points (4 days), we can observe:\n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (24-hour cycle) and also a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so weekly pattern might not be captured.\n    - We can use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple seasonal model.\n\n 5. However, note that the data shows:\n    - On 2017-04-27: values range from -1.34 to 1.541, with a dip at 05:00 and peak at 11:00 and 12:00? But 12:00 is negative? Actually, 12:00 is -0.871 and then 13:00 is 0.804. So it's not a clear pattern.\n    - On 2017-04-28: we see a peak at 13:00 and 14:00 (3.684) and then a gradual decline? and then a peak again at 23:00 (4.086).\n    - On 2017-04-29: the values are at 06:00 (5.023) and 10:00 (4.488) and then a drop at 12:00 (2.411) and then again a peak at 21:00 (3.349) and then drop.\n    - On 2017-04-30: the day starts at 3.081 and peaks at 10:00 and 11:00 (around 4.8-4.9) and then a sharp drop in the afternoon (from 13:00: 3.014, 14:00:1.875, 15:00:1.005, etc.) and then very low at night.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the short history, we might use a model that can capture seasonality. Since we have 24 hours in a day, we can set seasonality to 24.\n\n 7. We can use a seasonal naive method? But that would just take the same day of the previous period? But we only have 4 days and they are not exactly the same.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 9. However, note that we are required to provide the next 96 points. We must generate the timestamps and the forecast.\n\n 10. Since we are in a constrained environment (no code execution), we must rely on a simple and robust method.\n\n 11. Given the data, we can compute the average pattern for the 4 days and then adjust with the last known values? But the pattern is not consistent.\n\n 12. Another idea: use the last day (2017-04-30) as the base and then adjust by the trend? But the trend is not clear.\n\n 13. We can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the last few points to forecast the next.\n\n 14. However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a proper model.\n\n 15. Given the limitations, we can use a simple seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But with only 4 days, decomposition might be unstable.\n\n 16. We note that the data has:\n     - A daily seasonality: 24 hours.\n     - And we have 4 days (96 = 4*24).\n\n 17. We can use a seasonal naive model that uses the same hour from the previous day. But which day? The last day (2017-04-30) or an average of the last 4 days?\n\n 18. Let's try to average the same hour over the 4 days to get a daily profile and then use that for the next 4 days? But the next 4 days might be similar to the average of the past 4 days.\n\n 19. However, we see that the pattern on 2017-04-30 is different from the others: it has a sharp drop in the afternoon. So maybe the average would smooth that.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-04-30) as the pattern for the next day? But then we have to forecast 4 days. We can repeat the pattern of the last 4 days? But that would be 4 days and we need 4 days? So we can use the same 4 days? But that would be identical to the past 4 days? That doesn't account for any trend.\n\n 21. Considering the complexity and without being able to run a model, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour to form the next 4 days.\n\n 22. Steps for the average method:\n      For hour 00:00: average of 2017-04-27 00:00, 2017-04-28 00:00, 2017-04-29 00:00, 2017-04-30 00:00 -> (0.268, 0.737, 3.818, 3.081) -> (0.268+0.737+3.818+3.081)/4 = 7.904/4 = 1.976\n      Similarly for each hour.\n\n 23. But note: the data on 2017-04-30 23:00:00 is 2.076, and the next hour (2017-05-01 00:00:00) would be the average of the 00:00 of the past 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days of 00:00.\n\n 24. However, this method ignores any trend. We see that the values on the first two days are lower than the last two days? But then 2017-04-30 is lower than 2017-04-29? So the trend is not clear.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights? For example, weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] for the four days (from oldest to most recent). Then for 00:00: \n     0.1*0.268 + 0.2*0.737 + 0.3*3.818 + 0.4*3.081 = \n        0.0268 + 0.1474 + 1.1454 + 1.2324 = 2.552\n\n 26. But without a clear trend, we can stick to the simple average.\n\n 27. However, note that the problem says there might be missing values in the data? But the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't have to impute for the input.\n\n 28. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 29. How to generate the next 96 timestamps?\n     Start from: 2017-04-30 23:00:00 is the last point. The next timestamp is 2017-05-01 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n\n 30. We'll create a list of the next 96 timestamps.\n\n 31. Then for each hour in the day (00 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days we have.\n\n 32. Then we assign that average to the same hour in the next 4 days? Actually, we are going to have 4 days, so we can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 33. Therefore, the forecast for 2017-05-01 00:00:00 is the average of the 00:00 of the past 4 days, and similarly for 2017-05-02 00:00:00, 2017-05-03 00:00:00, 2017-05-04 00:00:00? But that would be the same value for all 4 days at 00:00? \n\n 34. Actually, we are going to have the same pattern repeated 4 times? That is, the entire day of 2017-05-01 will be the same as the average day we computed, and then the same for the next 3 days.\n\n 35. This is a simple seasonal forecast using the average daily profile.\n\n 36. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 00: (0.268, 0.737, 3.818, 3.081) -> (0.268+0.737+3.818+3.081)/4 = 7.904/4 = 1.976\n     Hour 01: (-0.603, 0.670, 3.416, 2.880) -> (-0.603+0.670+3.416+2.880)/4 = 6.363/4 = 1.59075\n     Hour 02: (-0.402, 0.268, 3.081, 2.813) -> (-0.402+0.268+3.081+2.813)/4 = 5.76/4 = 1.44\n     Hour 03: (-0.067, 0.134, 3.014, 2.880) -> (-0.067+0.134+3.014+2.880)/4 = 5.961/4 = 1.49025\n     Hour 04: (-0.536, 0.402, 3.818, 3.148) -> (-0.536+0.402+3.818+3.148)/4 = 6.832/4 = 1.708\n     Hour 05: (-1.340, 0.000, 3.416, 3.349) -> (-1.340+0.000+3.416+3.349)/4 = 5.425/4 = 1.35625\n     Hour 06: (-0.737, 1.206, 5.023, 3.818) -> (-0.737+1.206+5.023+3.818)/4 = 9.31/4 = 2.3275\n     Hour 07: (0.134, 0.402, 3.885, 3.014) -> (0.134+0.402+3.885+3.014)/4 = 7.435/4 = 1.85875\n     Hour 08: (0.536, 1.139, 4.086, 3.550) -> (0.536+1.139+4.086+3.550)/4 = 9.311/4 = 2.32775\n     Hour 09: (0.670, 1.139, 3.617, 4.957) -> (0.670+1.139+3.617+4.957)/4 = 10.383/4 = 2.59575\n     Hour 10: (1.072, 1.340, 4.153, 4.823) -> (1.072+1.340+4.153+4.823)/4 = 11.388/4 = 2.847\n     Hour 11: (1.541, 1.206, 4.488, 4.890) -> (1.541+1.206+4.488+4.890)/4 = 12.125/4 = 3.03125\n     Hour 12: (-0.871, 2.813, 2.411, 4.019) -> (-0.871+2.813+2.411+4.019)/4 = 8.372/4 = 2.093\n     Hour 13: (0.804, 3.684, 3.148, 3.014) -> (0.804+3.684+3.148+3.014)/4 = 10.65/4 = 2.6625\n     Hour 14: (0.737, 3.684, 3.014, 1.875) -> (0.737+3.684+3.014+1.875)/4 = 9.31/4 = 2.3275\n     Hour 15: (0.737, 2.679, 2.880, 1.005) -> (0.737+2.679+2.880+1.005)/4 = 7.301/4 = 1.82525\n     Hour 16: (0.536, 2.344, 2.679, 0.402) -> (0.536+2.344+2.679+0.402)/4 = 5.961/4 = 1.49025\n     Hour 17: (0.402, 1.808, 2.746, 0.402) -> (0.402+1.808+2.746+0.402)/4 = 5.358/4 = 1.3395\n     Hour 18: (0.000, 2.143, 1.942, 0.067) -> (0.000+2.143+1.942+0.067)/4 = 4.152/4 = 1.038\n     Hour 19: (-0.134, 2.277, 1.808, 0.268) -> (-0.134+2.277+1.808+0.268)/4 = 4.219/4 = 1.05475\n     Hour 20: (-0.536, 2.612, 2.210, 0.335) -> (-0.536+2.612+2.210+0.335)/4 = 4.621/4 = 1.15525\n     Hour 21: (-0.402, 2.277, 3.349, 0.268) -> (-0.402+2.277+3.349+0.268)/4 = 5.492/4 = 1.373\n     Hour 22: (-0.335, 2.411, 1.674, 0.067) -> (-0.335+2.411+1.674+0.067)/4 = 3.817/4 = 0.95425\n     Hour 23: (0.000, 4.086, 2.143, 2.076) -> (0.000+4.086+2.143+2.076)/4 = 8.305/4 = 2.07625\n\n 37. Then for the next 4 days (2017-05-01 to 2017-05-04), we assign:\n        Day 1 (2017-05-01): \n            00:00: 1.976\n            01:00: 1.59075\n            ... up to 23:00: 2.07625\n        Day 2 (2017-05-02): same as above\n        Day 3 (2017-05-03): same as above\n        Day 4 (2017-05-04): same as above\n\n 38. But note: the last value of the given data (2017-04-30 23:00:00) is 2.076, and our average for 23:00 is 2.07625, which is very close. So it's consistent.\n\n 39. However, we must round to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 40. Let's round the computed average to 3 decimal places.\n\n 41. Therefore, the forecast for the next 96 hours is 4 repetitions of the daily average profile.\n\n 42. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 43. The next 96 timestamps:\n\n     2017-05-01 00:00:00\n     2017-05-01 01:00:00\n     ...\n     2017-05-01 23:00:00\n     2017-05-02 00:00:00\n     ...\n     2017-05-04 23:00:00\n\n 44. We'll create the data accordingly.\n\n 45. We must output in the exact format.\n\n 46. Let's compute the rounded averages:\n\n     H00: 1.976 -> 1.976\n     H01: 1.59075 -> 1.591\n     H02: 1.44 -> 1.440\n     H03: 1.49025 -> 1.490\n     H04: 1.708 -> 1.708\n     H05: 1.35625 -> 1.356\n     H06: 2.3275 -> 2.328\n     H07: 1.85875 -> 1.859\n     H08: 2.32775 -> 2.328\n     H09: 2.59575 -> 2.596\n     H10: 2.847 -> 2.847\n     H11: 3.03125 -> 3.031\n     H12: 2.093 -> 2.093\n     H13: 2.6625 -> 2.663\n     H14: 2.3275 -> 2.328\n     H15: 1.82525 -> 1.825\n     H16: 1.49025 -> 1.490\n     H17: 1.3395 -> 1.340\n     H18: 1.038 -> 1.038\n     H19: 1.05475 -> 1.055\n     H20: 1.15525 -> 1.155\n     H21: 1.373 -> 1.373\n     H22: 0.95425 -> 0.954\n     H23: 2.07625 -> 2.076\n\n 47. Now, we'll write the next 96 rows:\n\n     Day1: 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-01 23:00:00: use the above 24 values in order.\n     Day2: 2017-05-02 00:00:00 to 2017-05-02 23:00:00: same 24 values.\n     Day3: 2017-05-03 00:00:00 to 2017-05-03 23:00:00: same.\n     Day4: 2017-05-04 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00: same.\n\n 48. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-01 00:00:00  1.976\n2017-05-01 01:00:00  1.591\n2017-05-01 02:00:00  1.440\n...\n2017-05-04 23:00:00  2.076\n```\n\n 49. We must be careful: the timestamps must be exactly 96 and in order.\n\n 50. We write the complete data.\n\n 51. Note: This is a simple method. In practice, one might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints and the small data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 52. We output the data.\n",
