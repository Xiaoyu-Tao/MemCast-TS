        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are missing values? But in the provided data, we have 96 consecutive points without any missing values in the given segment.\n 2. However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any. So we must be cautious that the future data we generate might need to account for potential missingness? \n    But the instruction says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we are to provide 96 points without missing values.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 points. Since the data is time series, we can use a time series forecasting method.\n\n 4. Given the data, we observe:\n    - The data seems to have daily patterns (24-hour cycles) and also some fluctuations.\n    - We have 4 days of data (96 hours).\n\n 5. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we have only 96 points, we can use a simple model like:\n    - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which can handle seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 points. We must generate 96 timestamps and corresponding HULL values.\n\n 7. We'll use the following approach:\n    a) Preprocess the data: create a time series object with frequency=24 (since daily seasonality).\n    b) Check for missing values in the provided data? The provided 96 points are complete. But if there were missing values, we would have to impute. \n       Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided segment does not, we assume the provided segment is complete and we are to forecast without missing values in the output.\n    c) We'll use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or an ARIMA model. Given the short length and clear seasonality, we can try both and choose one? \n       But note: with only 4 days, it's challenging to fit a seasonal model. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the past days.\n\n 8. Considering the limitations, a simple method is to use the average of each hour across the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    For example:\n        Let H_i(d) be the value at hour i (0-23) on day d.\n        We have days: d1=2017-05-17, d2=2017-05-18, d3=2017-05-19, d4=2017-05-20.\n\n        Then for the next day (2017-05-21) at hour 0: \n            forecast = (H_0(d1) + H_0(d2) + H_0(d3) + H_0(d4)) / 4\n\n        Similarly for each hour.\n\n 9. However, note that the data might have a strong daily pattern but also a trend? Let's check:\n\n    Looking at the data, the values at the same hour of the day are:\n\n    Hour 0: [0.871, 2.478, 2.545, 2.478] -> average = (0.871+2.478+2.545+2.478)/4 = 8.372/4 = 2.093\n    Hour 1: [1.608, 2.143, 2.746, 2.679] -> average = (1.608+2.143+2.746+2.679)/4 = 9.176/4 = 2.294\n\n    But we see that the pattern is not very stable. Also, the first day (2017-05-17) has lower values in the early hours.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour. Since we have only 4 days, we can use a simple average.\n\n 11. Steps for the average method:\n      - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average of hour0 to the hour0 of each day, and so on.\n\n 12. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided segment we don't have any. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 13. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-05-21 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-24 23:00:00.\n\n 14. Then we compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 15. However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-05-20) as the base and adjust by the average daily pattern? \n\n 16. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the last 4 days, but with weights (like more weight to recent days). But again, without more data, we stick to simple average.\n\n 17. We'll do:\n\n        hour_avgs = [0]*24\n        For hour in 0..23:\n            values = [ value at that hour from day1, day2, day3, day4 ]\n            hour_avgs[hour] = sum(values) / 4\n\n 18. Then for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) we assign:\n        day5, hour0: hour_avgs[0]\n        day5, hour1: hour_avgs[1]\n        ...\n        day8, hour23: hour_avgs[23]\n\n 19. But note: the data we have is for 4 days (day1 to day4). The next 4 days are day5 to day8.\n\n 20. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [0.871, 2.478, 2.545, 2.478] -> 2.093\n        hour1: [1.608, 2.143, 2.746, 2.679] -> 2.294\n        hour2: [1.674, 1.340, 2.880, 2.746] -> (1.674+1.340+2.880+2.746)/4 = 8.64/4 = 2.16\n        hour3: [2.143, 2.277, 2.679, 2.813] -> (2.143+2.277+2.679+2.813)/4 = 9.912/4 = 2.478\n        hour4: [2.612, 2.210, 2.344, 1.674] -> (2.612+2.210+2.344+1.674)/4 = 8.84/4 = 2.21\n        hour5: [2.947, 2.076, 2.076, 1.942] -> (2.947+2.076+2.076+1.942)/4 = 9.041/4 = 2.26025\n        hour6: [2.478, 1.407, 2.143, 2.813] -> (2.478+1.407+2.143+2.813)/4 = 8.841/4 = 2.21025\n        hour7: [3.215, 3.550, 3.081, 2.411] -> (3.215+3.550+3.081+2.411)/4 = 12.257/4 = 3.06425\n        hour8: [2.076, 3.885, 2.545, 2.143] -> (2.076+3.885+2.545+2.143)/4 = 10.649/4 = 2.66225\n        hour9: [1.072, 3.349, 1.942, 2.612] -> (1.072+3.349+1.942+2.612)/4 = 8.975/4 = 2.24375\n        hour10: [4.086, 3.952, 2.947, 3.349] -> (4.086+3.952+2.947+3.349)/4 = 14.334/4 = 3.5835\n        hour11: [4.086, 3.617, 2.478, 1.875] -> (4.086+3.617+2.478+1.875)/4 = 12.056/4 = 3.014\n        hour12: [3.349, 3.550, 1.808, 1.808] -> (3.349+3.550+1.808+1.808)/4 = 10.515/4 = 2.62875\n        hour13: [3.751, 4.287, 2.076, 1.808] -> (3.751+4.287+2.076+1.808)/4 = 11.922/4 = 2.9805\n        hour14: [3.282, 4.019, 2.813, 2.277] -> (3.282+4.019+2.813+2.277)/4 = 12.391/4 = 3.09775\n        hour15: [3.014, 3.282, 2.411, 1.741] -> (3.014+3.282+2.411+1.741)/4 = 10.448/4 = 2.612\n        hour16: [2.076, 2.478, 1.407, 1.608] -> (2.076+2.478+1.407+1.608)/4 = 7.569/4 = 1.89225\n        hour17: [2.210, 2.143, 1.474, 2.143] -> (2.210+2.143+1.474+2.143)/4 = 7.97/4 = 1.9925\n        hour18: [1.005, 1.474, 1.407, 1.808] -> (1.005+1.474+1.407+1.808)/4 = 5.694/4 = 1.4235\n        hour19: [1.340, 1.541, 1.206, 2.076] -> (1.340+1.541+1.206+2.076)/4 = 6.163/4 = 1.54075\n        hour20: [1.340, 1.340, 1.340, 2.009] -> (1.340+1.340+1.340+2.009)/4 = 6.029/4 = 1.50725\n        hour21: [1.273, 1.474, 1.139, 1.541] -> (1.273+1.474+1.139+1.541)/4 = 5.427/4 = 1.35675\n        hour22: [2.478, 2.143, 2.277, 1.541] -> (2.478+2.143+2.277+1.541)/4 = 8.439/4 = 2.10975\n        hour23: [2.277, 2.344, 1.674, 1.340] -> (2.277+2.344+1.674+1.340)/4 = 7.635/4 = 1.90875\n\n 21. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-05-21 to 2017-05-24) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-05-21): \n            00:00:00 -> 2.093\n            01:00:00 -> 2.294\n            02:00:00 -> 2.16\n            ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n 22. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are generating a complete forecast without missing values.\n\n 23. We'll generate the timestamps and the corresponding HULL values.\n\n 24. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-21 00:00:00 2.093\n2017-05-21 01:00:00 2.294\n2017-05-21 02:00:00 2.16\n... (96 lines)\n        </answer>\n\n 25. We'll write 96 lines.\n\n 26. But note: the averages we computed are rounded to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 27. However, the computed averages might have more than 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals to match the input.\n\n 28. Let's recompute the averages and round to 3 decimals:\n\n        hour0: 2.093 -> 2.093\n        hour1: 2.294 -> 2.294\n        hour2: 2.16 -> 2.160 (if we keep 3 decimals, but note: 2.16 is 2.160? but the original data had 3 decimals, so we write 2.160)\n        ... \n\n 29. Actually, the original data had 3 decimal places. So we output 3 decimal places.\n\n 30. We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Alternatively, we can use the exact value and then format to 3 decimals.\n\n 32. We'll do:\n\n        hour0: (0.871+2.478+2.545+2.478)/4 = 8.372/4 = 2.093 -> 2.093\n        hour1: (1.608+2.143+2.746+2.679)/4 = 9.176/4 = 2.294 -> 2.294\n        hour2: (1.674+1.340+2.880+2.746)/4 = 8.64/4 = 2.160\n        hour3: (2.143+2.277+2.679+2.813)/4 = 9.912/4 = 2.478\n        hour4: (2.612+2.210+2.344+1.674)/4 = 8.84/4 = 2.210\n        hour5: (2.947+2.076+2.076+1.942)/4 = 9.041/4 = 2.26025 -> 2.260\n        hour6: (2.478+1.407+2.143+2.813)/4 = 8.841/4 = 2.21025 -> 2.210\n        hour7: (3.215+3.550+3.081+2.411)/4 = 12.257/4 = 3.06425 -> 3.064\n        hour8: (2.076+3.885+2.545+2.143)/4 = 10.649/4 = 2.66225 -> 2.662\n        hour9: (1.072+3.349+1.942+2.612)/4 = 8.975/4 = 2.24375 -> 2.244\n        hour10: (4.086+3.952+2.947+3.349)/4 = 14.334/4 = 3.5835 -> 3.584\n        hour11: (4.086+3.617+2.478+1.875)/4 = 12.056/4 = 3.014 -> 3.014\n        hour12: (3.349+3.550+1.808+1.808)/4 = 10.515/4 = 2.62875 -> 2.629\n        hour13: (3.751+4.287+2.076+1.808)/4 = 11.922/4 = 2.9805 -> 2.981\n        hour14: (3.282+4.019+2.813+2.277)/4 = 12.391/4 = 3.09775 -> 3.098\n        hour15: (3.014+3.282+2.411+1.741)/4 = 10.448/4 = 2.612 -> 2.612\n        hour16: (2.076+2.478+1.407+1.608)/4 = 7.569/4 = 1.89225 -> 1.892\n        hour17: (2.210+2.143+1.474+2.143)/4 = 7.97/4 = 1.9925 -> 1.993\n        hour18: (1.005+1.474+1.407+1.808)/4 = 5.694/4 = 1.4235 -> 1.424\n        hour19: (1.340+1.541+1.206+2.076)/4 = 6.163/4 = 1.54075 -> 1.541\n        hour20: (1.340+1.340+1.340+2.009)/4 = 6.029/4 = 1.50725 -> 1.507\n        hour21: (1.273+1.474+1.139+1.541)/4 = 5.427/4 = 1.35675 -> 1.357\n        hour22: (2.478+2.143+2.277+1.541)/4 = 8.439/4 = 2.10975 -> 2.110\n        hour23: (2.277+2.344+1.674+1.340)/4 = 7.635/4 = 1.90875 -> 1.909\n\n 33. Now, we generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-21 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-05-24 23:00:00\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records.\n\n 34. For each day, we assign the 24 values in order.\n\n 35. Write the data in the same format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS value\"\n\n 36. We'll write:\n\n        2017-05-21 00:00:00 2.093\n        2017-05-21 01:00:00 2.294\n        2017-05-21 02:00:00 2.160\n        ... until 2017-05-21 23:00:00 1.909\n\n        Then 2017-05-22 00:00:00 2.093\n        ... and so on.\n\n 37. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 38. Let's code the output.\n\n 39. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 40.
