        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-10-01 00:00:00 to 2016-10-04 23:00:00) for the HULL (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to produce 96 future points (4 days).\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing. However, we must be cautious.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement for 96 forecasts, \n    we can consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple naive approach. However, we must account for potential patterns.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - There seems to be daily seasonality (24 hours). For example, the values drop during the night and rise during the day?\n   - Let's check: \n        On 2016-10-01: \n          00:00: 4.287 -> then drops to 1.273 at 23:00.\n        On 2016-10-02: \n          00:00: 1.741 -> then 2.813 at 23:00.\n        On 2016-10-03: \n          00:00: 3.818 -> then 3.340 at 23:00? Actually, 23:00 is 3.684? Wait, the last value of 2016-10-03 is 3.684? \n          But then 2016-10-04 starts at 4.890.\n\n   However, looking at the pattern, it doesn't show a clear daily seasonality in the usual sense. The pattern seems irregular.\n\n 4. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a model that can capture seasonality if present.\n    Since the frequency is hourly and we suspect a daily pattern (24 hours), we can try a seasonal model.\n\n 5. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is 4 days). \n\n Approach:\n   We can use a Seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality of 24.\n\n 6. But note: the data is very short (only 4 days) so fitting a seasonal model with 24 periods might be challenging.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal model and hope that the daily pattern is not strong? Or we can use a simple method.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we must provide the next 96 points. We'll use an automated model that can handle seasonality.\n\n 9. We'll use the `statsmodels` library in Python to fit a model. However, since we are to generate the answer without running code, \n    we must rely on a precomputed forecast? But the problem requires us to be an expert and provide the forecast.\n\n 10. Since we cannot run code here, we have to think of a method that is simple and justifiable.\n\n 11. Let's try to break down the problem:\n\n     We have 96 points. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n     But that would be too simple and ignore trends.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing without seasonality.\n\n 13. However, note that the data shows:\n        Day 1: 2016-10-01: min=1.273, max=4.488\n        Day 2: 2016-10-02: min=0.938, max=2.880\n        Day 3: 2016-10-03: min=1.340, max=4.019\n        Day 4: 2016-10-04: min=1.942, max=5.023\n\n     There is an increasing trend in the maximum? But the minimum doesn't show a clear trend.\n\n 14. We can try to fit a linear trend and then add the seasonal component? But again, with only 4 days, the seasonal component might be noisy.\n\n 15. Given the ambiguity, we must produce a forecast. We decide to use:\n\n     - A simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? \n\n     For example, for the 00:00 hour, we have:\n        2016-10-01 00:00:00 -> 4.287\n        2016-10-02 00:00:00 -> 1.741\n        2016-10-03 00:00:00 -> 3.818\n        2016-10-04 00:00:00 -> 4.890\n\n        Average = (4.287 + 1.741 + 3.818 + 4.890) / 4 = 3.684\n\n     Then for 00:00 of the next 4 days (2016-10-05, 2016-10-06, 2016-10-07, 2016-10-08) we would use 3.684? \n     But that ignores any trend and also the fact that the values are changing.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-04) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive repetition.\n\n 17. We are going to use a combination of the last day and the average of the last 4 days? \n\n 18. However, note that the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided data we don't have any. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 19. We decide to use a seasonal naive approach: \n        Forecast for hour h of day d (where d from 5 to 8) = the value of hour h of day (d-4) ? \n        But we only have 4 days, so for day5 we can use day1, day6 use day2, etc.\n\n     Specifically:\n        Day5 (2016-10-05) = Day1 (2016-10-01)\n        Day6 (2016-10-06) = Day2 (2016-10-02)\n        Day7 (2016-10-07) = Day3 (2016-10-03)\n        Day8 (2016-10-08) = Day4 (2016-10-04)\n\n     This method is called the seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 4 days? But wait, we are forecasting daily patterns? \n     Actually, we are forecasting the next 4 days by repeating the previous 4 days. \n\n     However, note that the data does not show a clear 4-day seasonality? It's only 4 days of data. \n\n 20. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for each of the next 4 days? That would be:\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we set the value to the average of that hour in the past 4 days.\n\n     This would give a constant pattern for each day? \n\n 21. We can also consider a drift? But without a clear trend, it's hard.\n\n 22. Given the time and the requirement, we choose the average method for each hour.\n\n     Steps:\n        For hour 0: average of [4.287, 1.741, 3.818, 4.890] = 3.684\n        For hour 1: average of [4.354, 0.938, 3.818, 5.023] = (4.354+0.938+3.818+5.023)/4 = 3.53325\n        ... and so on for each of the 24 hours.\n\n     Then we repeat the same 24-hour pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 23. But note: the data for the same hour on different days can vary. We are essentially removing the daily variation and replacing it with the average.\n\n 24. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then assign that average to the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 25. How to compute:\n\n        We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n        We group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and take the mean.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days, for each hour, we use the computed mean for that hour.\n\n 26. Example for hour 0 (00:00): \n        Day1: 4.287\n        Day2: 1.741\n        Day3: 3.818\n        Day4: 4.890\n        Mean = (4.287+1.741+3.818+4.890)/4 = 14.736/4 = 3.684\n\n     Hour 1 (01:00):\n        Day1: 4.354\n        Day2: 0.938\n        Day3: 3.818\n        Day4: 5.023\n        Mean = (4.354+0.938+3.818+5.023)/4 = 14.133/4 = 3.53325\n\n     We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 27. Then the forecast for:\n        2016-10-05 00:00:00 -> 3.684\n        2016-10-05 01:00:00 -> 3.53325\n        ... until 2016-10-05 23:00:00 -> [mean of hour23]\n\n        Then 2016-10-06 00:00:00 -> 3.684 (same as 2016-10-05 00:00:00, because it's the same hour0)\n        and so on.\n\n 28. This method is simple and uses the average daily pattern.\n\n 29. We must round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean.\n\n     Hour 0: [4.287, 1.741, 3.818, 4.890] -> 3.684\n     Hour 1: [4.354, 0.938, 3.818, 5.023] -> 3.53325 -> 3.533\n     Hour 2: [4.488, 1.340, 3.684, 4.890] -> (4.488+1.340+3.684+4.890)/4 = 14.402/4 = 3.6005 -> 3.601\n     Hour 3: [3.952, 1.206, 3.818, 4.890] -> (3.952+1.206+3.818+4.890)/4 = 13.866/4 = 3.4665 -> 3.467\n     Hour 4: [4.287, 1.942, 2.545, 4.287] -> (4.287+1.942+2.545+4.287)/4 = 13.061/4 = 3.26525 -> 3.265\n     Hour 5: [3.014, 1.005, 3.282, 3.617] -> (3.014+1.005+3.282+3.617)/4 = 10.918/4 = 2.7295 -> 2.730\n     Hour 6: [3.215, 1.407, 2.947, 4.890] -> (3.215+1.407+2.947+4.890)/4 = 12.459/4 = 3.11475 -> 3.115\n     Hour 7: [3.952, 1.541, 4.019, 4.220] -> (3.952+1.541+4.019+4.220)/4 = 13.732/4 = 3.433\n     Hour 8: [3.550, 2.009, 3.416, 4.689] -> (3.550+2.009+3.416+4.689)/4 = 13.664/4 = 3.416\n     Hour 9: [3.215, 2.344, 3.282, 3.751] -> (3.215+2.344+3.282+3.751)/4 = 12.592/4 = 3.148\n     Hour 10: [3.416, 2.880, 2.947, 4.555] -> (3.416+2.880+2.947+4.555)/4 = 13.798/4 = 3.4495 -> 3.450\n     Hour 11: [3.282, 2.545, 2.478, 4.287] -> (3.282+2.545+2.478+4.287)/4 = 12.592/4 = 3.148\n     Hour 12: [2.813, 1.674, 2.076, 3.684] -> (2.813+1.674+2.076+3.684)/4 = 10.247/4 = 2.56175 -> 2.562\n     Hour 13: [3.416, 1.942, 2.813, 3.684] -> (3.416+1.942+2.813+3.684)/4 = 11.855/4 = 2.96375 -> 2.964\n     Hour 14: [3.416, 2.746, 3.215, 3.416] -> (3.416+2.746+3.215+3.416)/4 = 12.793/4 = 3.19825 -> 3.198\n     Hour 15: [3.349, 2.746, 3.148, 4.555] -> (3.349+2.746+3.148+4.555)/4 = 13.798/4 = 3.4495 -> 3.450\n     Hour 16: [2.813, 2.813, 3.014, 3.684] -> (2.813+2.813+3.014+3.684)/4 = 12.324/4 = 3.081\n     Hour 17: [2.947, 2.411, 2.344, 3.349] -> (2.947+2.411+2.344+3.349)/4 = 11.051/4 = 2.76275 -> 2.763\n     Hour 18: [2.612, 1.407, 1.942, 2.679] -> (2.612+1.407+1.942+2.679)/4 = 8.64/4 = 2.160\n     Hour 19: [2.545, 1.474, 2.143, 2.679] -> (2.545+1.474+2.143+2.679)/4 = 8.841/4 = 2.21025 -> 2.210\n     Hour 20: [2.143, 1.340, 2.009, 2.612] -> (2.143+1.340+2.009+2.612)/4 = 8.104/4 = 2.026\n     Hour 21: [2.210, 1.340, 1.541, 1.942] -> (2.210+1.340+1.541+1.942)/4 = 7.033/4 = 1.75825 -> 1.758\n     Hour 22: [2.009, 2.344, 1.340, 3.416] -> (2.009+2.344+1.340+3.416)/4 = 9.109/4 = 2.27725 -> 2.277\n     Hour 23: [1.273, 2.813, 3.684, 4.689] -> (1.273+2.813+3.684+4.689)/4 = 12.459/4 = 3.11475 -> 3.115\n\n 31. Now, we create the next 4 days (2016-10-05 to 2016-10-08) by repeating the above 24 values for each day.\n\n 32.

We write the entire 96 points.\n\n 40. We must be cautious: the input data ends at 2016-10-04 23:00:00, so the next day is 2016-10-05 00:00:00.\n\n 41. We generate the dates:\n\n        from 2016-10-05 00:00:00 to 2016-10-08 23:00:00, hourly steps.\n\n 42. We output in the same format.\n\n 43. We note that the method is very basic, but with only 4 days of data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 44. If we had more data, we would use a more sophisticated model.\n\n 45. We output the data as per the format.\n\n 46. We must not omit any content.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required format.\n",
