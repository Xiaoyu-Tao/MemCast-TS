        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hours of data (from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00) and we are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 4 days later at 2017-09-17 23:00:00).\n\n However, note that the data has missing values issue. But in the provided data, there are no missing values in the given 96 points. We are to forecast the next 96 points.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data is at hourly frequency, we can use a time series model. Given the complexity and the need to handle potential seasonality (daily patterns) and trends, we can use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet.\n\n However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (with 24-hour cycles). Therefore, we should use a model that can capture seasonality.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Preprocess the data: The given data is for 4 days (96 hours). We can set the frequency to 'H'.\n 2. We note that the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are none. For forecasting, we assume the next 96 points are consecutive without gaps.\n 3. We will use a model that can handle seasonality. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the need for daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters). However, with only 4 days, it's challenging to fit a seasonal model with 24 periods. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model or a naive approach.\n\n Considering the limitations, we might use:\n   - Naive: forecast the last day (24 hours) repeated for the next 4 days? But the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n   - Or, we can use the average of the past 4 days for each hour.\n\n However, let's look at the data: \n   The data for each day seems to have a similar pattern: \n        - Lower values (negative) during the day and positive or less negative at night? \n        But let's see:\n\n        Day 1 (09-10): \n          00:00: -1.173, 12:00: 0.995, 23:00: -1.102\n        Day 2 (09-11):\n          00:00: 0.640, 12:00: -2.416, 23:00: -0.142\n        Day 3 (09-12):\n          00:00: -0.284, 12:00: 1.386, 23:00: -1.386\n        Day 4 (09-13):\n          00:00: -1.599, 12:00: 0.036, 23:00: -0.178\n\n   The pattern is not very consistent. Therefore, we might need a model that can capture the trend and seasonality.\n\n Given the small data, we can try to use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But note that we have to forecast 96 points (4 days) and we have only 4 days of history.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average per hour of the day. We take the average of the same hour for the 4 days we have and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   For hour 00:00: average of [-1.173, 0.640, -0.284, -1.599] = (-1.173+0.640-0.284-1.599)/4 = (-2.416)/4 = -0.604\n   For hour 01:00: average of [-0.036, -0.853, -0.675, -0.462] = (-0.036 -0.853 -0.675 -0.462)/4 = (-2.026)/4 = -0.5065\n\n   Then we repeat the same 24 averages for each of the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall mean per day:\n   Day1: mean = (-1.173 -0.036 ... -1.102) / 24 -> we can compute roughly: the numbers are mostly negative, but let's not compute exactly. The pattern might be shifting.\n\n But given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, this might be the best we can do.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. Let's try with Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality (Holt-Winters). The Holt-Winters method requires at least two full seasons to fit, and we have 4 days (so 4 seasons of daily data). We can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n However, with only 4 seasons, the model might not be very stable. But we can try.\n\n Steps for Holt-Winters:\n   - We use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels.\n   - We fit the model with trend and seasonal components, and seasonal period=24.\n\n But note: the data might have additive or multiplicative seasonality? Looking at the data, the variation doesn't seem to grow with the level, so additive might be appropriate.\n\n We'll fit an ExponentialSmoothing model with additive trend and additive seasonality.\n\n However, due to the constraints of the problem (we are to provide the forecast for the next 96 points) and the fact that we are in an AI response, we must generate the forecast.\n\n Since I cannot run code in this environment, I will use the average per hour method as a fallback because it is simple and we have to provide an answer.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n   hour0: [ -1.173,  0.640, -0.284, -1.599] -> (-1.173+0.640-0.284-1.599)/4 = (-2.416)/4 = -0.604\n   hour1: [ -0.036, -0.853, -0.675, -0.462] -> (-0.036 -0.853 -0.675 -0.462) = -2.026 -> -0.5065\n   hour2: [ -0.426, -0.355, -1.492, -0.995] -> (-0.426-0.355-1.492-0.995) = -3.268 -> -0.817\n   hour3: [ -0.995, -0.320, -0.533, -0.746] -> (-0.995-0.320-0.533-0.746) = -2.594 -> -0.6485\n   hour4: [ -0.853, -0.604, -0.888, -0.604] -> (-0.853-0.604-0.888-0.604) = -2.949 -> -0.73725\n   hour5: [ -0.853, -0.462, -1.990, -1.528] -> (-0.853-0.462-1.990-1.528) = -4.833 -> -1.20825\n   hour6: [ -1.919, -0.640, -3.269, -2.452] -> (-1.919-0.640-3.269-2.452) = -8.28 -> -2.07\n   hour7: [ -1.599, -1.244, -2.843, -0.817] -> (-1.599-1.244-2.843-0.817) = -6.503 -> -1.62575\n   hour8: [ -1.635, -0.782, -1.954, -0.959] -> (-1.635-0.782-1.954-0.959) = -5.33 -> -1.3325\n   hour9: [ -1.102, -1.812, -0.249,  0.604] -> (-1.102-1.812-0.249+0.604) = -2.559 -> -0.63975\n   hour10: [ -1.564, -2.239,  0.355,  1.777] -> (-1.564-2.239+0.355+1.777) = -1.671 -> -0.41775\n   hour11: [ -1.564, -1.919,  1.635, -0.213] -> (-1.564-1.919+1.635-0.213) = -2.061 -> -0.51525\n   hour12: [  0.995, -2.416,  1.386,  0.036] -> (0.995-2.416+1.386+0.036) = (0.995+1.386+0.036-2.416)= (2.417-2.416)=0.001 -> ~0.00025\n   hour13: [ -0.924, -2.239,  1.706,  2.025] -> (-0.924-2.239+1.706+2.025) = (-3.163+3.731)=0.568 -> 0.142\n   hour14: [ -1.031, -2.025,  0.959,  1.244] -> (-1.031-2.025+0.959+1.244) = (-3.056+2.203)= -0.853 -> -0.21325\n   hour15: [ -2.381, -2.274, -0.320,  0.675] -> (-2.381-2.274-0.320+0.675) = (-4.975+0.675)= -4.3 -> -1.075\n   hour16: [ -1.635, -2.061, -1.919, -1.173] -> (-1.635-2.061-1.919-1.173) = -6.788 -> -1.697\n   hour17: [ -2.310, -2.452, -2.594, -2.452] -> (-2.310-2.452-2.594-2.452) = -9.808 -> -2.452\n   hour18: [ -2.736, -3.056, -2.097, -2.416] -> (-2.736-3.056-2.097-2.416) = -10.305 -> -2.57625\n   hour19: [ -2.736, -2.878, -2.559, -2.523] -> (-2.736-2.878-2.559-2.523) = -10.696 -> -2.674\n   hour20: [ -2.630, -2.665, -1.741, -2.381] -> (-2.630-2.665-1.741-2.381) = -9.417 -> -2.35425\n   hour21: [ -3.092, -3.234, -1.777, -3.482] -> (-3.092-3.234-1.777-3.482) = -11.585 -> -2.89625\n   hour22: [ -3.020, -2.274, -1.137,  0.000] -> (-3.020-2.274-1.137+0.000) = -6.431 -> -1.60775\n   hour23: [ -1.102, -0.142, -1.386, -0.178] -> (-1.102-0.142-1.386-0.178) = -2.808 -> -0.702\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2017-09-14 to 2017-09-17), we assign:\n   2017-09-14 00:00:00 -> -0.604\n   2017-09-14 01:00:00 -> -0.5065\n   ... and so on for 24 hours.\n\n Then repeat the same 24 values for the next 3 days.\n\n But note: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n However, the problem says: the next 96 recorded dates. Since the data is hourly, the next 96 hours are:\n\n   2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-14 23:00:00 (24 hours)\n   2017-09-15 00:00:00 to 2017-09-15 23:00:00 (next 24)\n   2017-09-16 00:00:00 to 2017-09-16 23:00:00 (next 24)\n   2017-09-17 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00 (next 24)\n\n So we will have 4 days, each day having the 24 averaged values.\n\n But note: the last given data point is 2017-09-13 23:00:00, so the next one is 2017-09-14 00:00:00.\n\n We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n However, the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are to provide the complete data for the next 96. So we generate without missing.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n   We'll create a list of dates from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00 (96 hours).\n\n   The MULL values will be the 24 averages we computed, repeated 4 times.\n\n But note: the averages we computed for each hour (0 to 23) and we have 24 values. We will use the same set for each day.\n\n However, we must round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the original data.\n\n Let me round the averages:\n\n   hour0: -0.604\n   hour1: -0.5065 -> -0.507\n   hour2: -0.817\n   hour3: -0.6485 -> -0.649\n   hour4: -0.73725 -> -0.737\n   hour5: -1.20825 -> -1.208\n   hour6: -2.07\n   hour7: -1.62575 -> -1.626\n   hour8: -1.3325 -> -1.333\n   hour9: -0.63975 -> -0.640\n   hour10: -0.41775 -> -0.418\n   hour11: -0.51525 -> -0.515\n   hour12: 0.00025 -> 0.000\n   hour13: 0.142\n   hour14: -0.21325 -> -0.213\n   hour15: -1.075\n   hour16: -1.697\n   hour17: -2.452\n   hour18: -2.57625 -> -2.576\n   hour19: -2.674\n   hour20: -2.35425 -> -2.354\n   hour21: -2.89625 -> -2.896\n   hour22: -1.60775 -> -1.608\n   hour23: -0.702\n\n Now, we write the data for the next 96 hours:\n\n   Day1 (2017-09-14):\n        00:00:00 -> -0.604\n        01:00:00 -> -0.507\n        02:00:00 -> -0.817\n        03:00:00 -> -0.649\n        04:00:00 -> -0.737\n        05:00:00 -> -1.208\n        06:00:00 -> -2.070\n        07:00:00 -> -1.626\n        08:00:00 -> -1.333\n        09:00:00 -> -0.640\n        10:00:00 -> -0.418\n        11:00:00 -> -0.515\n        12:00:00 ->  0.000\n        13:00:00 ->  0.142\n        14:00:00 -> -0.213\n        15:00:00 -> -1.075\n        16:00:00 -> -1.697\n        17:00:00 -> -2.452\n        18:00:00 -> -2.576\n        19:00:00 -> -2.674\n        20:00:00 -> -2.354\n        21:00:00 -> -2.896\n        22:00:00 -> -1.608\n        23:00:00 -> -0.702\n\n   Then repeat the same for the next three days.\n\n But note: the pattern might change? However, with the limited data, this is the best we can do.\n\n Alternatively, if we had more data we could use a more sophisticated model, but we are constrained by the 96 points.\n\n We'll output the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date] [value]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n   We'll create a list of dates starting from 2017-09-14 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-09-17 23:00:00.\n\n   The MULL values will be the 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n We'll write the data in the same format: two columns, with the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the MULL value with 3 decimal places.\n\n Since the original data has negative and positive values, we'll output as floats.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
