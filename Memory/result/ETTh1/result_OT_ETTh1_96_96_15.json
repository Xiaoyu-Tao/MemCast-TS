        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records (from 2016-08-30 00:00:00 to 2016-09-02 23:00:00) of oil temperature (OT) for a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-09-03 00:00:00 to 2016-09-06 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has some missing values? But in the provided data, we have 96 consecutive records without any missing values in the given segment.\n    However, the problem states that the dataset may have missing values. Since we are only given 96 points and they are complete, we can proceed with this segment.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 3. We choose a model for time series forecasting. Given the data is hourly and shows daily seasonality (as seen by the daily pattern of temperature),\n    we can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we are only given 4 days of data, we have limited history.\n\n 4. Given the small data size, we can use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, or perhaps Exponential Smoothing with seasonality. However, note that the data has a clear daily cycle (24 hours).\n\n 5. We observe:\n    - The temperature rises during the day and falls at night.\n    - The values on 2016-08-31 are constant 25.044? This might be an anomaly or missing data (but it's provided as constant). However, we have to take it as is.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    We can use a seasonal model that uses the last cycle (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next cycle. But note we have 4 cycles (4 days) and the last day (2016-09-02) is the most recent.\n\n    However, the pattern might be changing. Since we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days), we can use the last 24 hours of the available data (i.e., the day of 2016-09-02) and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n    But that would ignore any trend and the fact that the days might be different (like weekend vs weekday? but we don't have that info).\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing method that accounts for seasonality. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can use:\n\n    - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with a seasonality of 24 periods.\n\n 8. However, note that we have only 4 days (96 points) and we are trying to fit a model with 24 seasons. This is the minimum required (at least two full seasons to fit). We can try.\n\n 9. But the problem says the data may have missing values. In our given 96 points, we don't have missing values, so we can use them.\n\n10. Implementation:\n    We can use the `statsmodels` library for Holt-Winters. But note: we are to output the next 96 points.\n\n    Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n      - Fit an ExponentialSmoothing model with trend and seasonal components (additive or multiplicative?).\n      - We observe the amplitude of the seasonality does not change dramatically with the level? Let's check:\n          On 2016-08-02: min ~24.2, max ~32.6\n          On 2016-09-01: min ~24.7, max ~30.7\n          On 2016-09-02: min ~24.2, max ~32.6\n        The range is similar, so additive seasonality might be appropriate.\n\n    However, we are not coding but reasoning. Since we cannot run code, we must simulate the process.\n\n    But note: the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate 96 values.\n\n11. Given the constraints, we can use a simple approach: \n    We take the average of each hour across the 4 days we have, and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n    But the last day (2016-09-02) might be more representative? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last 24 hours and repeat them 4 times? \n\n    However, we note that the temperature might have a trend? Looking at the data, the temperature on 2016-09-02 is similar to 2016-08-30? \n\n    Let's compare the same hour:\n\n    2016-08-30 00:00:00: 24.129\n    2016-08-31 00:00:00: 25.044\n    2016-09-01 00:00:00: 26.31\n    2016-09-02 00:00:00: 26.802 -> increasing?\n\n    But then 2016-09-03 00:00:00? We don't know.\n\n    Without a clear trend and with only 4 days, it's hard to project a trend. \n\n12. We decide to use the average of the four days for each hour to form a typical day, and then use that typical day repeated for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n      - Group by hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (2016-09-03 to 2016-09-06), we assign the typical hour value for each hour.\n\n    But note: the data for 2016-08-31 is constant? That day is all 25.044. This will pull the average towards that value. Is that acceptable?\n    Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of that constant day? Or we can use the last day (2016-09-02) only? \n\n    The problem says the data may have missing values, but we are not told which ones are missing. The constant day might be an anomaly.\n\n    Since we are not given any context about the constant day, we have to use the data as is.\n\n    We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (24.129 + 25.044 + 26.31 + 26.802) / 4 = (24.129+25.044=49.173; 49.173+26.31=75.483; 75.483+26.802=102.285) /4 = 25.57125\n        hour1: (23.918 + 25.044 + 25.888 + 26.31) /4 = (23.918+25.044=48.962; 48.962+25.888=74.85; 74.85+26.31=101.16) /4 = 25.29\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n    But note: the last day (2016-09-02) has 24 hours? Yes, from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n    However, the data for 2016-09-02 ends at 23:00:00 with 27.153999. We have 4 days of 24 hours each.\n\n13. We must generate 96 points. We can create a typical day of 24 hours by averaging the 4 days for each hour, then repeat that typical day 4 times.\n\n    But note: the dates must be generated. The last date in the given data is 2016-09-02 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2016-09-03 00:00:00, 2016-09-03 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-06 23:00:00.\n\n14. However, the problem says the data will have missing values. But we are generating the forecast, so we are to provide the next 96 without missing? \n    We are to provide the complete data for the next 96.\n\n15. We decide to use the average method. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n    Let's do a sample for the first hour (00:00:00):\n\n        Day1: 24.129\n        Day2: 25.044\n        Day3: 26.31\n        Day4: 26.802\n        Average = (24.129+25.044+26.31+26.802)/4 = 102.285/4 = 25.57125\n\n    Similarly, for 01:00:00:\n\n        Day1: 23.918\n        Day2: 25.044\n        Day3: 25.888\n        Day4: 26.31? -> Wait, the 01:00:00 of 2016-09-02 is 26.309999? Actually, the data for 2016-09-02 01:00:00 is 26.309999? \n        But looking at the data:\n\n          2016-09-02 00:00:00 26.802000\n          2016-09-02 01:00:00 26.309999\n\n        So: 23.917999 (2016-08-30 01:00:00), 25.044001 (2016-08-31 01:00:00), 25.888000 (2016-09-01 01:00:00), 26.309999 (2016-09-02 01:00:00)\n\n        Average = (23.918 + 25.044 + 25.888 + 26.31) / 4 = 100.16 / 4 = 25.29\n\n    We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n16. Then we form a list of 24 values (the typical day). Then we repeat this list 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n17. We must also generate the dates. The next date after 2016-09-02 23:00:00 is 2016-09-03 00:00:00, then 2016-09-03 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-06 23:00:00.\n\n18. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, with two columns: date and OT.\n\n19. We must be cautious: the given data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places for consistency.\n\n20. Steps to compute the typical day:\n\n    We group the data by the time of day (ignoring the date). We have 4 observations for each hour (00,01,...,23).\n\n    We compute the mean for each hour.\n\n    Then we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-09-03): typical day\n        Day 2 (2016-09-04): typical day\n        Day 3 (2016-09-05): typical day\n        Day 4 (2016-09-06): typical day\n\n21. Let's compute the typical day:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00): [24.129, 25.044, 26.31, 26.802] -> average = (24.129+25.044+26.31+26.802)/4 = 102.285/4 = 25.57125 -> 25.571\n    Hour 1 (01:00): [23.918, 25.044, 25.888, 26.31] -> (23.918+25.044+25.888+26.31)=101.16 -> 101.16/4=25.29 -> 25.290\n    Hour 2 (02:00): [24.551, 25.044, 25.747, 25.958] -> (24.551+25.044+25.747+25.958)=101.3 -> 101.3/4=25.325 -> 25.325\n    Hour 3 (03:00): [24.481, 25.044, 25.395, 25.466] -> (24.481+25.044+25.395+25.466)=100.386 -> 100.386/4=25.0965 -> 25.097\n    Hour 4 (04:00): [24.621, 25.044, 25.255, 24.903] -> (24.621+25.044+25.255+24.903)=99.823 -> 99.823/4=24.95575 -> 24.956\n    Hour 5 (05:00): [24.621, 25.044, 25.114, 24.410] -> (24.621+25.044+25.114+24.410)=99.189 -> 99.189/4=24.79725 -> 24.797\n    Hour 6 (06:00): [24.410, 25.044, 24.692, 24.199] -> (24.410+25.044+24.692+24.199)=98.345 -> 98.345/4=24.58625 -> 24.586\n    Hour 7 (07:00): [24.903, 25.044, 25.325, 24.621] -> (24.903+25.044+25.325+24.621)=99.893 -> 99.893/4=24.97325 -> 24.973\n    Hour 8 (08:00): [25.325, 25.044, 26.310, 24.832] -> (25.325+25.044+26.310+24.832)=101.511 -> 101.511/4=25.37775 -> 25.378\n    Hour 9 (09:00): [26.521, 25.044, 27.365, 26.239] -> (26.521+25.044+27.365+26.239)=105.169 -> 105.169/4=26.29225 -> 26.292\n    Hour 10 (10:00): [27.717, 25.044, 28.702, 28.068] -> (27.717+25.044+28.702+28.068)=109.531 -> 109.531/4=27.38275 -> 27.383\n    Hour 11 (11:00): [27.787, 25.044, 27.365, 27.717] -> (27.787+25.044+27.365+27.717)=107.913 -> 107.913/4=26.97825 -> 26.978\n    Hour 12 (12:00): [28.279, 25.044, 27.717, 28.561] -> (28.279+25.044+27.717+28.561)=109.601 -> 109.601/4=27.40025 -> 27.400\n    Hour 13 (13:00): [28.702, 25.044, 28.983, 29.194] -> (28.702+25.044+28.983+29.194)=111.923 -> 111.923/4=27.98075 -> 27.981\n    Hour 14 (14:00): [30.320, 25.044, 30.531, 31.726] -> (30.320+25.044+30.531+31.726)=117.621 -> 117.621/4=29.40525 -> 29.405\n    Hour 15 (15:00): [30.038, 25.044, 30.531, 31.515] -> (30.038+25.044+30.531+31.515)=117.128 -> 117.128/4=29.282 -> 29.282\n    Hour 16 (16:00): [30.531, 25.044, 30.742, 31.726] -> (30.531+25.044+30.742+31.726)=118.043 -> 118.043/4=29.51075 -> 29.511\n    Hour 17 (17:00): [30.320, 25.044, 30.320, 32.571] -> (30.320+25.044+30.320+32.571)=118.255 -> 118.255/4=29.56375 -> 29.564\n    Hour 18 (18:00): [28.772, 25.044, 30.109, 30.179] -> (28.772+25.044+30.109+30.179)=114.104 -> 114.104/4=28.526 -> 28.526\n    Hour 19 (19:00): [26.873, 25.044, 29.053, 28.139] -> (26.873+25.044+29.053+28.139)=109.109 -> 109.109/4=27.27725 -> 27.277\n    Hour 20 (20:00): [25.958, 25.044, 28.420, 27.506] -> (25.958+25.044+28.420+27.506)=106.928 -> 106.928/4=26.732 -> 26.732\n    Hour 21 (21:00): [25.255, 25.044, 27.857, 27.224] -> (25.255+25.044+27.857+27.224)=105.38 -> 105.38/4=26.345 -> 26.345\n    Hour 22 (22:00): [24.832, 25.044, 27.646, 26.873] -> (24.832+25.044+27.646+26.873)=104.395 -> 104.395/4=26.09875 -> 26.099\n    Hour 23 (23:00): [24.410, 25.044, 26.943, 27.154] -> (24.410+25.044+26.943+27.154)=103.551 -> 103.551/4=25.88775 -> 25.888\n\n    We have the typical day:\n\n        hour0: 25.571\n        hour1: 25.290\n        hour2: 25.325\n        hour3: 25.097\n        hour4: 24.956\n        hour5: 24.797\n        hour6: 24.586\n        hour7: 24.973\n        hour8: 25.378\n        hour9: 26.292\n        hour10: 27.383\n        hour11: 26.978\n        hour12: 27.400\n        hour13: 27.981\n        hour14: 29.405\n        hour15: 29.282\n        hour16: 29.511\n        hour17: 29.564\n        hour18: 28.526\n        hour19: 27.277\n        hour20: 26.732\n        hour21: 26.345\n        hour22: 26.099\n        hour23: 25.888\n\n22.

We generate the dates:\n\n    Start: 2016-09-03 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-09-02 23:00:00)\n    Then 2016-09-03 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-06 23:00:00.\n\n    We note that September has 30 days, so:\n\n        2016-09-03, 04, 05, 06 are all valid.\n\n24. We output 96 lines.\n\n25. Format: We output in the same format: two columns, with the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the OT as a float with 3 decimal places.\n\n26. We must be in the exact format.\n\nLet's write the first few:\n\n    2016-09-03 00:00:00 25.571\n    2016-09-03 01:00:00 25.290\n    2016-09-03 02:00:00 25.325\n    2016-09-03 03:00:00 25.097\n    ... \n\nBut note: the original data had 6 decimal places? Actually, it had 3 decimal places but sometimes 6 digits. We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\nHowever, the original data had:\n\n    24.129000 -> we output 24.129\n    23.917999 -> we output 23.918? But we computed 25.290 which is 3 decimals.\n\n    We computed the average and rounded to 3 decimals. We did:\n\n        hour0: 25.57125 -> rounded to 25.571 (if we keep 3 decimals, we round to the nearest thousandth)\n\n    We did:\n\n        hour1: 25.29 -> we wrote 25.290 to keep 3 decimals.\n\n    So we output with 3 decimals.\n\n27. We generate the entire 96 points.\n\n28. We output in the required XML-like tag.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\nSo we write 96 lines.\n\nLet's code the dates:\n\n    Start: 2016-09-03 00:00:00\n    Then we add 1 hour until we have 96.\n\n    We can use:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 3, 9, 0, 0, 0)   # but wait, the last date is 2016-09-02 23:00:00, so next is 2016-09-03 00:00:00\n\n    But we are not coding, we are writing.\n\n    We know:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-03: 24 hours\n        Day2: 2016-09-04: 24 hours\n        Day3: 2016-09-05: 24 hours\n        Day4: 2016-09-06: 24 hours\n\n    Total 96.\n\n    We have the typical day pattern: 24 values.\n\n    We repeat the pattern 4 times.\n\n29.

We did:\n\n    hour0: 25.57125 -> rounded to 25.571 (since 0.00025 is less than 0.0005, we round down? Actually, 25.57125 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal (2) which is <5, so 25.571.\n\n    We did the same for others.\n\nHowever, note that the original data had values like 23.917999 which we used as 23.918? But in the average we used 23.918.\n\n    We used the values as given (with 3 decimal places) for the average? Actually, the original data had 6 decimals, but we only see 3. We used the 3 decimal representation.\n\n    This is acceptable.\n\nWe output the 96 lines.\n\nNote: the problem says \"Please obey the format strictly\".
