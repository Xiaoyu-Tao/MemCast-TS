        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-11-22 00:00:00 to 2016-11-25 23:00:00) for the Middle Useful Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 dates does not have any missing values in the given sample.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the nature of the data (hourly, with potential daily seasonality), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality and trends.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given 96 points (4 days) and we need to forecast the next 96 points (another 4 days), we can consider:\n   - The data shows a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, we see peaks and troughs at similar hours each day.\n   - We can use a seasonal model. Given the small amount of data, we can use a simple seasonal decomposition or a seasonal naive approach, but we need to account for the possibility of non-stationarity.\n\n However, note that the problem states the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't see any. So we can proceed without imputation for the historical part.\n\n Considering the requirement for 96 forecasts and the hourly seasonality, we can use:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) with a seasonal period of 24.\n   - Or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with a seasonality of 24.\n\n But note: we have only 4 days (96 points) to train on. This is very limited for a seasonal model with 24 periods. We might get better results with a simpler model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal approach: \n   - The forecast for each hour of the next day is the same as the same hour of the previous day (or an average of the same hour over the past 4 days). \n\n However, the problem does not specify the required model. Since we are experts, we should choose a model that is appropriate for short-term forecasting with seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use a seasonal naive model that takes the average of the same hour over the available 4 days.\n\n Steps for the model:\n   - We have 4 days (from 2016-11-22 to 2016-11-25) of hourly observations.\n   - For each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00), we compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n   - Then, for the next 4 days (2016-11-26 to 2016-11-29), we assign the average value for each hour.\n\n Why this approach?\n   - It is simple and robust with very little data.\n   - It captures the daily pattern.\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend? Looking at the provided data, the values at the same hour do not vary dramatically over the 4 days. \n\n Let's check a few hours:\n\n   Hour 00:00: \n      2016-11-22: 8.528\n      2016-11-23: 10.127\n      2016-11-24: 8.173\n      2016-11-25: 6.467\n      Average = (8.528+10.127+8.173+6.467)/4 = 8.32375\n\n   Hour 01:00:\n      7.782, 10.980, 9.132, 7.818 -> average = (7.782+10.980+9.132+7.818)/4 = 8.928\n\n But note: the last day (2016-11-25) has a lower value at 00:00 (6.467) than the first day (8.528). This might indicate a downward trend? \n However, with only 4 days, it is hard to extrapolate a trend. Therefore, we stick to the average.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a moving average to capture the trend? But again, 4 days is too short.\n\n Therefore, we will use the next 4 days by repeating the average daily pattern.\n\n How to generate the next 96 points?\n   - We have 24 hours in a day, and we need 4 days -> 96 hours.\n   - We compute the average for each of the 24 hours (from 00:00 to 23:00) over the 4 available days.\n\n Steps:\n   1. Group the data by hour of the day (i.e., the time part: 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00).\n   2. For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 values for that hour.\n   3. Then, for the next 4 days (starting from 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00), we assign:\n        Day 1 (2016-11-26): the 24 average values in order (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00)\n        Day 2 (2016-11-27): the same 24 average values\n        Day 3 (2016-11-28): the same\n        Day 4 (2016-11-29): the same\n\n But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data to capture weekly (only 4 days, not even a full week). So we ignore.\n\n However, let's check the dates: \n   - 2016-11-22 is a Tuesday, 2016-11-23 Wednesday, 2016-11-24 Thursday, 2016-11-25 Friday.\n   - The next 4 days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? \n   - 2016-11-26: Saturday\n   - 2016-11-27: Sunday\n   - 2016-11-28: Monday\n   - 2016-11-29: Tuesday\n\n We don't have data for Saturday, Sunday, Monday in the training set. So we cannot capture the weekly pattern. Therefore, we stick to the daily pattern.\n\n But note: the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days? \n   - Actually, the user says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 hours (4 days). \n\n Therefore, we proceed with the daily average.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 hours (from 00:00 to 23:00) and for each hour, we average the 4 values we have.\n\n   Then, we create the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-26 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-11-25 23:00:00)\n        End: 2016-11-29 23:00:00 (96 hours later)\n\n   And assign the average values for the corresponding hour.\n\n However, note: the last timestamp in the given data is 2016-11-25 23:00:00. The next timestamp is 2016-11-26 00:00:00.\n\n Let's compute the averages:\n\n   We'll create a dictionary or list for the 24 hours.\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00): [8.528, 10.127, 8.173, 6.467] -> mean = (8.528+10.127+8.173+6.467)/4 = 8.32375\n   hour 1 (01:00): [7.782, 10.980, 9.132, 7.818] -> (7.782+10.980+9.132+7.818)/4 = 8.928\n   ... and so on.\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this 24-hour average pattern 4 times.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n   So we can compute the average without imputation.\n\n However, to be safe, if we had missing values in the historical data we would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", meaning we might get missing values in the future? \n   But the task is to forecast the next 96 points. We are not given any future data. We are only forecasting.\n\n   So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the mean.\n\n   We note the data:\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): [8.528, 10.127, 8.173, 6.467] -> 8.32375\n        Hour 1 (01:00): [7.782, 10.980, 9.132, 7.818] -> 8.928\n        Hour 2 (02:00): [8.422, 11.691, 8.599, 6.538] -> (8.422+11.691+8.599+6.538)/4 = 8.8125\n        Hour 3 (03:00): [8.706, 10.767, 8.564, 7.711] -> (8.706+10.767+8.564+7.711)/4 = 8.937\n        Hour 4 (04:00): [8.848, 10.056, 7.391, 7.285] -> (8.848+10.056+7.391+7.285)/4 = 8.395\n        Hour 5 (05:00): [7.747, 11.194, 7.924, 7.427] -> (7.747+11.194+7.924+7.427)/4 = 8.573\n        Hour 6 (06:00): [8.493, 11.691, 7.995, 7.071] -> (8.493+11.691+7.995+7.071)/4 = 8.8125\n        Hour 7 (07:00): [9.737, 11.798, 10.874, 8.031] -> (9.737+11.798+10.874+8.031)/4 = 10.11\n        Hour 8 (08:00): [10.127, 9.275, 8.884, 8.671] -> (10.127+9.275+8.884+8.671)/4 = 9.23925\n        Hour 9 (09:00): [6.219, 6.041, 6.361, 6.183] -> (6.219+6.041+6.361+6.183)/4 = 6.201\n        Hour 10 (10:00): [5.650, 6.041, 6.361, 6.574] -> (5.650+6.041+6.361+6.574)/4 = 6.1565\n        Hour 11 (11:00): [6.681, 6.858, 7.676, 6.929] -> (6.681+6.858+7.676+6.929)/4 = 7.036\n        Hour 12 (12:00): [5.259, 5.224, 4.868, 4.904] -> (5.259+5.224+4.868+4.904)/4 = 5.06375\n        Hour 13 (13:00): [5.686, 6.041, 6.219, 5.330] -> (5.686+6.041+6.219+5.330)/4 = 5.819\n        Hour 14 (14:00): [5.721, 7.285, 6.681, 7.000] -> (5.721+7.285+6.681+7.000)/4 = 6.67175\n        Hour 15 (15:00): [5.295, 7.000, 5.863, 6.432] -> (5.295+7.000+5.863+6.432)/4 = 6.1475\n        Hour 16 (16:00): [5.153, 5.757, 5.899, 6.290] -> (5.153+5.757+5.899+6.290)/4 = 5.77475\n        Hour 17 (17:00): [6.361, 6.823, 6.503, 6.787] -> (6.361+6.823+6.503+6.787)/4 = 6.6185\n        Hour 18 (18:00): [5.259, 5.366, 6.148, 5.757] -> (5.259+5.366+6.148+5.757)/4 = 5.6325\n        Hour 19 (19:00): [4.655, 4.904, 5.757, 5.721] -> (4.655+4.904+5.757+5.721)/4 = 5.25925\n        Hour 20 (20:00): [4.051, 4.371, 5.295, 5.224] -> (4.051+4.371+5.295+5.224)/4 = 4.73525\n        Hour 21 (21:00): [4.264, 4.015, 4.193, 4.620] -> (4.264+4.015+4.193+4.620)/4 = 4.273\n        Hour 22 (22:00): [7.214, 5.366, 4.300, 7.533] -> (7.214+5.366+4.300+7.533)/4 = 6.10325\n        Hour 23 (23:00): [9.168, 7.462, 6.610, 7.214] -> (9.168+7.462+6.610+7.214)/4 = 7.6135\n\n   Then, the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-11-26): \n            00:00: 8.32375\n            01:00: 8.928\n            02:00: 8.8125\n            ... until 23:00: 7.6135\n\n        Day 2 (2016-11-27): same 24 values\n        Day 3 (2016-11-28): same\n        Day 4 (2016-11-29): same\n\n   We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, note the input data has 3 decimal places. We will round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n   But note: the average might not be exactly representable in 3 decimals. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Example: 8.32375 -> 8.324? But the input has 8.528, 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We can use: round(value, 3)\n\n   However, let's check: 8.32375 rounded to 3 decimals: \n        8.32375 -> 8.324? \n        But note: 8.32375 is exactly 8.324 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n        The rule: look at the 4th decimal: 7, which is >=5, so we round up: 8.324.\n\n   But wait, the input data does not have 4 decimal places. It has 3. So we output 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use formatting to 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"complete data\", meaning we must output the next 96 points with the same format.\n\n   We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-11-26 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-11-26 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-29 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list of 96 timestamps and then assign the 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n   The 24-hour pattern (averages rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n        hour0: 8.324\n        hour1: 8.928\n        hour2: 8.812\n        (because 8.8125 -> 8.812? but note: 8.8125 rounded to 3 decimals: the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal: 8.813? \n         However, let me check: \n            8.8125: \n                The third decimal is 2, the next is 5 -> then we round up the 2 to 3? -> 8.813.\n\n        We must be careful.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            value = 8.8125\n            round(8.8125, 3) -> 8.813\n\n        Similarly, 8.32375 -> 8.324\n\n        So recalculating:\n\n        hour0: 8.32375 -> 8.324\n        hour1: 8.928 -> 8.928 (exactly, so 8.928)\n        hour2: 8.8125 -> 8.813\n        hour3: 8.937 -> 8.937 (exactly, so 8.937)\n        hour4: 8.395 -> 8.395\n        hour5: 8.573 -> 8.573\n        But wait, 8.573 is 8.573 exactly? \n            The average for hour5: (7.747+11.194+7.924+7.427)/4 = 34.292/4 = 8.573 -> exactly 8.573 -> so 8.573\n        hour6: 8.8125 -> 8.813\n        hour7: 10.11 -> but wait, we computed 10.11? Actually, we had (9.737+11.798+10.874+8.031)=40.44 -> 40.44/4=10.11 -> 10.110 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 10.110 -> 10.11? \n            But we have to represent with 3 decimals: 10.110 is 10.110 -> we can write 10.110? but the input has 10.127 (three decimals). \n            Actually, 10.11 is 10.110 -> so we can write 10.110? \n            However, the input does not have trailing zeros? \n            The input: \n                2016-11-22 00:00:00  8.528 -> 8.528 has three decimals.\n\n            We should output 3 decimal places. So 10.110 is 10.110 -> but we can write 10.11? -> but that would be two decimals.\n\n            We must output 3 decimals. So 10.110 -> 10.110? but that is 4 decimals? \n\n            Actually, we should output the number rounded to 3 decimals and then format to 3 decimals.\n\n            How about: \n                if the number is 10.11, then we output 10.110? \n                But the input does not have trailing zeros. For example, 10.127 is 10.127, not 10.1270.\n\n            We note that the input has exactly 3 decimal places. So we output 3 decimal places.\n\n            So 10.11 -> 10.110? but that is 10.110 which is 3 decimals? Actually, 10.110 has three decimals? \n                The first decimal: 1, second: 1, third: 0 -> so 10.110.\n\n            But the input, we have 10.127 -> that is 10.127 (three decimals). \n\n            So we output 10.110 for hour7? \n\n            However, 10.11 is 10.110 when written to 3 decimals? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use formatting: \n                \"{:.3f}\".format(10.11) -> '10.110'\n\n            But the input does not have trailing zeros? \n\n            Actually, the input has:\n                10.127 -> that is 10.127, not 10.1270.\n\n            We must outputting the same formatting? \n\n            The problem says: \"complete data\" and the format of the data is with 3 decimal places. \n\n            So we output the number with 3 decimal places, which may include trailing zeros.\n\n            Example: 10.11 becomes 10.110.\n\n            But note: the input has 10.127, which is 10.127. So we output 10.110 for hour7.\n\n        However, let me recalculate hour7: \n            (9.737+11.798+10.874+8.031) = 40.44 -> 40.44/4 = 10.11 -> so 10.11 is 10.110 when written to 3 decimals.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            hour7: 10.110\n\n        Similarly, hour8: 9.23925 -> 9.239 (because 9.23925: the 4th decimal is 2 -> so 9.239)\n\n        hour9: 6.201 -> 6.201\n        hour10: 6.1565 -> 6.157 (because 6.1565: 4th decimal 5 -> round up: 6.157)\n        hour11: 7.036 -> 7.036\n        hour12: 5.06375 -> 5.064\n        hour13: 5.819 -> 5.819\n        hour14: 6.67175 -> 6.672\n        hour15: 6.1475 -> 6.148\n        hour16: 5.77475 -> 5.775\n        hour17: 6.6185 -> 6.619\n        hour18: 5.6325 -> 5.633\n        hour19: 5.25925 -> 5.259\n        hour20: 4.73525 -> 4.735\n        hour21: 4.273 -> 4.273\n        But wait: 4.273 is 4.273? \n            The average: (4.264+4.015+4.193+4.620)/4 = 17.092/4 = 4.273 -> exactly 4.273 -> so 4.273\n        hour22: 6.10325 -> 6.103\n        hour23: 7.6135 -> 7.614\n\n   So the 24-hour pattern (from 00 to 23) is:\n\n        [8.324, 8.928, 8.813, 8.937, 8.395, 8.573, 8.813, 10.110, 9.239, 6.201, 6.157, 7.036, 5.064, 5.819, 6.672, 6.148, 5.775, 6.619, 5.633, 5.259, 4.735, 4.273, 6.103, 7.614]\n\n   Then we repeat this list 4 times for the 4 days.\n\n   Now, we generate the timestamps:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-26 00:00:00 to 2016-11-26 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day2: 2016-11-27 00:00:00 to 2016-11-27 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2016-11-28 00:00:00 to 2016-11-28 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2016-11-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00:00\n\n   We note that the last given date is 2016-11-25 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-11-26 00:00:00.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start = datetime(2016, 26, 11) -> but wait, the string is \"2016-11-26\"\n\n        Actually, the last date in the input is 2016-11-25 23:00:00.\n\n        We can start at: 2016-11-26 00:00:00.\n\n        We'll generate 96 hours.\n\n   However, we are not to use programming, we are to write the answer.\n\n   We can write a table:\n\n        date, MUFL\n\n        2016-11-26 00:00:00, 8.324\n        2016-11-26 01:00:00, 8.928\n        2016-11-26 02:00:00, 8.813\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll write 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must output all 96.\n\n   We are to output in the same format as the input.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        date   MUFL\n        2016-11-26 00:00:00  8.324\n        2016-11-26 01:00:00  8.928\n        ... \n        2016-11-29 23:00:00  7.614\n\n        </answer>\n\n   However, we must be careful: the date format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-26\n        Day 2: 2016-11-27\n        Day 3: 2016-11-28\n        Day 4: 2016-11-29\n\n   And for each day, the 24 hours from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll write the data in the next 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the input had the date as index? We output the same.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        date               MUFL\n        2016-11-26 00:00:00  8.324\n        2016-11-26 01:00:00  8.928\n        ... \n\n   We must not omit any.\n\n   However, writing 96 lines by hand is tedious. We can generate it in code, but we are in text.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we write all 96.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-26: [8.324, 8.928, 8.813, 7.937? ... wait, we have the list above]\n\n   Let me write the list of averages again (with rounding) for the 24 hours:\n\n        hour00: 8.324\n        hour01: 8.928\n        hour02: 8.813\n        hour03: 8.937\n        hour04: 8.395\n        hour05: 8.573\n        hour06: 8.813\n        hour07: 10.110\n        hour08: 9.239\n        hour09: 6.201\n        hour10: 6.157\n        hour11: 7.036\n        hour12: 5.064\n        hour13: 5.819\n        hour14: 6.672\n        hour15: 6.148\n        hour16: 5.775\n        hour17: 6.619\n        hour18: 5.633\n        hour19: 5.259\n        hour20: 4.735\n        hour21: 4.273\n        hour22: 6.103\n        hour23: 7.614\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n   We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n   We must be cautious: the rounding we did might have slight inaccuracies, but it's the best we can do.\n\n   Let's output the data for the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-11-26\n            00:00:00 -> 8.324\n            01:00:00 -> 8.928\n            02:00:00 -> 8.813\n            03:00:00 -> 8.937\n            04:00:00 -> 8.395\n            05:00:00 -> 8.573\n            06:00:00 -> 8.813\n            07:00:00 -> 10.110\n            08:00:00 -> 9.239\n            09:00:00 -> 6.201\n            10:00:00 -> 6.157\n            11:00:00 -> 7.036\n            12:00:00 -> 5.064\n            13:00:00 -> 5.819\n            14:00:00 -> 6.672\n            15:00:00 -> 6.148\n            16:00:00 -> 5.775\n            17:00:00 -> 6.619\n            18:00:00 -> 5.633\n            19:00:00 -> 5.259\n            20:00:00 -> 4.735\n            21:00:00 -> 4.273\n            22:00:00 -> 6.103\n            23:00:00 -> 7.614\n\n        Day2: 2016-11-27: same values in the same as above 24 numbers.\n\n        Day3: 2016-11-28: same.\n\n        Day4: 2016-11-29: same.\n\n   We write the data in the format.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", so we write all 96.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   However, note: the input had the date as a string without quotes, and the MUFL as a float with 3 decimals.\n\n   We output:\n\n        <answer>\n               date   MUFL\n        2016-11-26 00:00:00  8.324\n        2016-11-26 01:00:00  8.928\n        ... \n        2016-11-29 23:00:00  7.614\n        </answer>\n\n   We must write 96 lines of data.\n\n   We'll do it step by step.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we write all.\n\n   We'll generate the data and write it.\n\n   However, due to the length, we must be careful.\n\n   We'll write the first 5 and last 5 for the example?
