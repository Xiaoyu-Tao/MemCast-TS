        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 24*4=96).\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data is relatively short (only 4 days) and we are to forecast 4 days, \n    we can consider methods that capture daily seasonality. The data shows a pattern: \n    - Lower values during night (e.g., around 0.7-0.9) and higher during the day (peaking around 1.5).\n    - The seasonality period is 24 hours.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal model. Since we have only 96 points, complex models might overfit. We can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by taking the same hour from the last available day.\n    - However, we have 4 days of history. We might average the same hour over the past 4 days? But note: the pattern might change.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, or an ARIMA model with seasonal components (SARIMA).\n    But with only 4 days, fitting a full SARIMA might be challenging.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, a simple approach is to use the last available day (the 4th day) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the problem says the data has missing values, but in the provided data there are none. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n 7. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", meaning in the future? But we are only given the past 96 without missing.\n\n 8. We are to produce 96 data points. We can use a seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours, but using the last complete cycle (last 24 hours) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n    Why 4 times? Because 96/24=4.\n\n    But note: the data from the last day (2017-08-12) is:\n        00:00: 0.853\n        01:00: 0.822\n        02:00: 0.731\n        03:00: 1.097\n        04:00: 0.883\n        05:00: 1.036\n        06:00: 1.157\n        07:00: 1.218\n        08:00: 1.523\n        09:00: 1.401\n        10:00: 1.432\n        11:00: 1.249\n        12:00: 1.157\n        13:00: 1.157\n        14:00: 1.249\n        15:00: 1.218\n        16:00: 1.218\n        17:00: 1.157\n        18:00: 1.157\n        19:00: 0.944\n        20:00: 0.975\n        21:00: 0.853\n        22:00: 0.761\n        23:00: 0.670\n\n    We can repeat this pattern for the next 4 days? But note: the problem says the data might have missing values in the future? \n    But we are to forecast without knowing the future missing values. We are to produce 96 points.\n\n 9. However, the problem says \"be aware of that\" for missing values, but in the provided past data there are none. \n    And we are forecasting the future, so we don't have to handle missing values in the future because we are generating the forecast.\n\n10. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the entire dataset (the one we are forecasting for) might have missing? \n    But we are to provide the complete data for the next 96. So we must fill in all 96.\n\n11. Approach: We'll use the last 24 hours and repeat them 4 times to get 96 hours.\n\n    However, we can also consider using the average of the same hour over the 4 days? But the 4 days might have a trend? \n    Let's check the overall pattern:\n\n    Day 1 (2017-08-09): \n        Min: 0.731, Max: 1.675\n    Day 2 (2017-08-10): \n        Min: 0.792, Max: 1.523\n    Day 3 (2017-08-11): \n        Min: 0.853, Max: 1.432\n    Day 4 (2017-08-12): \n        Min: 0.670, Max: 1.523\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend. The pattern is similar.\n\n12. We can also try to use the average of each hour over the 4 days to form a typical day and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n    Let's compute the average for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 days.\n\n    But note: we have 4 days, so for hour 00:00: \n        Day1: 0.822, Day2: 0.853, Day3: 1.157, Day4: 0.853 -> average = (0.822+0.853+1.157+0.853)/4 = 3.685/4 = 0.92125\n\n    Similarly for other hours.\n\n    Then we can use this typical day and repeat it 4 times.\n\n13. However, the last day (day4) might be the most recent and most representative? \n\n14. Considering the trade-off: \n    - Using the last day only: might be more responsive to recent changes, but might be noisy.\n    - Using the average: smooths out noise but might not capture recent changes.\n\n15. Since we don't have a clear trend and the data is short, I will use the average method to form a typical day and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n    Why? Because the average over 4 days might be more stable.\n\n16. Steps for average method:\n    - Group by hour (i.e., the time of day: 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the mean for that hour.\n\n    We have 24 hours and 4 days.\n\n17. Let's compute the typical day:\n\n    Hour 00:00: (0.822 + 0.853 + 1.157 + 0.853) / 4 = (0.822+0.853=1.675; 1.675+1.157=2.832; 2.832+0.853=3.685) -> 3.685/4 = 0.92125\n    Hour 01:00: (0.761 + 0.792 + 0.944 + 0.822) / 4 = (0.761+0.792=1.553; 1.553+0.944=2.497; 2.497+0.822=3.319) -> 3.319/4 = 0.82975\n    Hour 02:00: (0.731 + 0.944 + 0.853 + 0.731) / 4 = (0.731+0.944=1.675; 1.675+0.853=2.528; 2.528+0.731=3.259) -> 3.259/4 = 0.81475\n    ... and so on.\n\n    We have to do this for all 24 hours.\n\n18. But note: the data provided is exactly 4 days (96 hours). We can reshape the LULL values into a 4x24 matrix and then take the mean along the days.\n\n19. Alternatively, we can use code to compute, but since we are to write the answer, we do it manually? \n    However, the problem requires 96 points, and doing by hand is error prone.\n\n    But note: we are an AI, we can compute it.\n\n    Let me extract the LULL values in order:\n\n    Day1: [0.822, 0.761, 0.731, 0.761, 0.944, 0.975, 1.066, 1.340, 1.340, 1.492, 1.675, 1.614, 1.553, 1.614, 1.553, 1.614, 1.462, 1.218, 1.097, 1.157, 1.188, 1.066, 1.218, 1.066]\n    Day2: [0.853, 0.792, 0.944, 0.914, 0.914, 1.005, 1.127, 1.523, 1.340, 1.492, 1.157, 1.340, 1.157, 1.157, 1.310, 1.279, 1.371, 1.310, 1.127, 1.036, 1.157, 1.188, 1.005, 0.914]\n    Day3: [1.157, 0.944, 0.853, 1.097, 1.188, 0.914, 1.249, 1.401, 1.340, 1.432, 1.401, 1.401, 1.310, 1.371, 1.340, 1.401, 1.340, 1.371, 1.401, 1.097, 1.157, 1.066, 0.944, 0.914]\n    Day4: [0.853, 0.822, 0.731, 1.097, 0.883, 1.036, 1.157, 1.218, 1.523, 1.401, 1.432, 1.249, 1.157, 1.157, 1.249, 1.218, 1.218, 1.157, 1.157, 0.944, 0.975, 0.853, 0.761, 0.670]\n\n    Now, for each hour (column index from 0 to 23) we compute the mean.\n\n    We'll do:\n\n    h0: (0.822 + 0.853 + 1.157 + 0.853) / 4 = 0.92125\n    h1: (0.761 + 0.792 + 0.944 + 0.822) / 4 = 0.82975\n    h2: (0.731 + 0.944 + 0.853 + 0.731) / 4 = 0.81475\n    h3: (0.761 + 0.914 + 1.097 + 1.097) / 4 = (0.761+0.914=1.675; 1.675+1.097=2.772; 2.772+1.097=3.869) -> 3.869/4 = 0.96725\n    h4: (0.944 + 0.914 + 1.188 + 0.883) / 4 = (0.944+0.914=1.858; 1.858+1.188=3.046; 3.046+0.883=3.929) -> 3.929/4 = 0.98225\n    h5: (0.975 + 1.005 + 0.914 + 1.036) / 4 = (0.975+1.005=1.98; 1.98+0.914=2.894; 2.894+1.036=3.93) -> 3.93/4 = 0.9825\n    h6: (1.066 + 1.127 + 1.249 + 1.157) / 4 = (1.066+1.127=2.193; 2.193+1.249=3.442; 3.442+1.157=4.599) -> 4.599/4 = 1.14975\n    h7: (1.340 + 1.523 + 1.401 + 1.218) / 4 = (1.340+1.523=2.863; 2.863+1.401=4.264; 4.264+1.218=5.482) -> 5.482/4 = 1.3705\n    h8: (1.340 + 1.340 + 1.340 + 1.523) / 4 = (1.340+1.340=2.68; 2.68+1.340=4.02; 4.02+1.523=5.543) -> 5.543/4 = 1.38575\n    h9: (1.492 + 1.492 + 1.432 + 1.401) / 4 = (1.492+1.492=2.984; 2.984+1.432=4.416; 4.416+1.401=5.817) -> 5.817/4 = 1.45425\n    h10: (1.675 + 1.157 + 1.401 + 1.432) / 4 = (1.675+1.157=2.832; 2.832+1.401=4.233; 4.233+1.432=5.665) -> 5.665/4 = 1.41625\n    h11: (1.614 + 1.340 + 1.401 + 1.249) / 4 = (1.614+1.340=2.954; 2.954+1.401=4.355; 4.355+1.249=5.604) -> 5.604/4 = 1.401\n    h12: (1.553 + 1.157 + 1.310 + 1.157) / 4 = (1.553+1.157=2.71; 2.71+1.310=4.02; 4.02+1.157=5.177) -> 5.177/4 = 1.29425\n    h13: (1.614 + 1.157 + 1.371 + 1.157) / 4 = (1.614+1.157=2.771; 2.771+1.371=4.142; 4.142+1.157=5.299) -> 5.299/4 = 1.32475\n    h14: (1.553 + 1.310 + 1.340 + 1.249) / 4 = (1.553+1.310=2.863; 2.863+1.340=4.203; 4.203+1.249=5.452) -> 5.452/4 = 1.363\n    h15: (1.614 + 1.279 + 1.401 + 1.218) / 4 = (1.614+1.279=2.893; 2.893+1.401=4.294; 4.294+1.218=5.512) -> 5.512/4 = 1.378\n    h16: (1.462 + 1.371 + 1.340 + 1.218) / 4 = (1.462+1.371=2.833; 2.833+1.340=4.173; 4.173+1.218=5.391) -> 5.391/4 = 1.34775\n    h17: (1.218 + 1.310 + 1.371 + 1.157) / 4 = (1.218+1.310=2.528; 2.528+1.371=3.899; 3.899+1.157=5.056) -> 5.056/4 = 1.264\n    h18: (1.097 + 1.127 + 1.401 + 1.157) / 4 = (1.097+1.127=2.224; 2.224+1.401=3.625; 3.625+1.157=4.782) -> 4.782/4 = 1.1955\n    h19: (1.157 + 1.036 + 1.097 + 0.944) / 4 = (1.157+1.036=2.193; 2.193+1.097=3.29; 3.29+0.944=4.234) -> 4.234/4 = 1.0585\n    h20: (1.188 + 1.157 + 1.157 + 0.975) / 4 = (1.188+1.157=2.345; 2.345+1.157=3.502; 3.502+0.975=4.477) -> 4.477/4 = 1.11925\n    h21: (1.066 + 1.188 + 1.066 + 0.853) / 4 = (1.066+1.188=2.254; 2.254+1.066=3.32; 3.32+0.853=4.173) -> 4.173/4 = 1.04325\n    h22: (1.218 + 1.005 + 0.944 + 0.761) / 4 = (1.218+1.005=2.223; 2.223+0.944=3.167; 3.167+0.761=3.928) -> 3.928/4 = 0.982\n    h23: (1.066 + 0.914 + 0.914 + 0.670) / 4 = (1.066+0.914=1.98; 1.98+0.914=2.894; 2.894+0.670=3.564) -> 3.564/4 = 0.891\n\n    So the typical day (24 hours) is:\n    [0.92125, 0.82975, 0.81475, 0.96725, 0.98225, 0.9825, 1.14975, 1.3705, 1.38575, 1.45425, 1.41625, 1.401, 1.29425, 1.32475, 1.363, 1.378, 1.34775, 1.264, 1.1955, 1.0585, 1.11925, 1.04325, 0.982, 0.891]\n\n20.

The next 96 hours start from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n    We generate the dates:\n    2017-08-13 00:00:00 -> typical day h0: 0.92125\n    2017-08-13 01:00:00 -> typical day h1: 0.82975\n    ...\n    2017-08-13 23:00:00 -> typical day h23: 0.891\n    2017-08-14 00:00:00 -> typical day h0: 0.92125\n    ... and so on until 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n22.

We round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places. So we round the averages to 3 decimals.\n\n    But note: the average might have more decimals. We'll round to 3.\n\n    Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n    h0: 0.92125 -> 0.921\n    h1: 0.82975 -> 0.830\n    h2: 0.81475 -> 0.815\n    h3: 0.96725 -> 0.967\n    h4: 0.98225 -> 0.982\n    h5: 0.9825 -> 0.983 (since 0.9825 rounds to 0.983? But note: 0.9825 is exactly halfway, and in this case we round to even? \n          but typically in such contexts we round to the nearest. 0.9825 is 0.983 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n          Actually, 0.9825 is 0.983 if we use round half up. Let's do round half up.\n\n    We'll use: round(x, 3) which in Python would round to 3 decimals. We are to write the numbers.\n\n    Alternatively, we can present with 3 decimals as in the input.\n\n    We recalc the typical day with rounding to 3 decimals:\n\n    h0: 0.921\n    h1: 0.830\n    h2: 0.815\n    h3: 0.967\n    h4: 0.982\n    h5: 0.983   (because 0.9825 -> 0.983)\n    h6: 1.150   (1.14975 -> 1.150)\n    h7: 1.371   (1.3705 -> 1.371) [because 0.0005 rounds up? Actually, 1.3705 is 1.371 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n            1.3705: the fourth decimal is 5, so we round up the third decimal: 1.371]\n    h8: 1.386   (1.38575 -> 1.386)\n    h9: 1.454   (1.45425 -> 1.454)\n    h10: 1.416  (1.41625 -> 1.416)\n    h11: 1.401  (exactly 1.401)\n    h12: 1.294  (1.29425 -> 1.294)\n    h13: 1.325  (1.32475 -> 1.325)\n    h14: 1.363  (exactly 1.363)\n    h15: 1.378  (exactly 1.378)\n    h16: 1.348  (1.34775 -> 1.348)\n    h17: 1.264  (exactly 1.264)\n    h18: 1.196  (1.1955 -> 1.196)\n    h19: 1.059  (1.0585 -> 1.059)\n    h20: 1.119  (1.11925 -> 1.119)\n    h21: 1.043  (1.04325 -> 1.043)\n    h22: 0.982  (exactly 0.982)\n    h23: 0.891  (exactly 0.891)\n\n    But note: h5: 0.9825 -> rounding: \n        The rule: look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> round up the 3rd decimal (which is 2) to 3? so 0.983.\n\n    Similarly, h7: 1.3705 -> 1.371 (because 0.3705: the 4th decimal is 5, so round up the 3rd decimal (0) to 1? \n        Actually, 1.3705: \n            The digit in the 3rd decimal is 0, the next is 5 -> so we round up the 0 to 1 -> 1.371.\n\n    h8: 1.38575 -> \n        1.38575: \n          3rd decimal: 5, 4th decimal: 7 -> which is >=5, so we round up the 5 to 6 -> 1.386.\n\n    h13: 1.32475 -> \n        1.32475: \n          3rd decimal: 4, 4th decimal: 7 -> round up 4 to 5 -> 1.325.\n\n    h16: 1.34775 -> \n        1.34775: \n          3rd decimal: 7, 4th decimal: 5 -> round up 7 to 8 -> 1.348.\n\n    h18: 1.1955 -> \n        1.1955: \n          3rd decimal: 5, 4th decimal: 5 -> round up 5 to 6 -> 1.196.\n\n    But note: 1.1955: \n        The 3rd decimal is 5, and the 4th is 5 -> we round up the 5 to 6? \n        However, the rule: if the digit to be rounded is followed by 5, and there are non-zero digits after, we round up? \n        But here, after the 5 there is nothing? Actually, 1.1955 is the same as 1.19550... \n        The rule: round half up: 0.0005 would round 5 up. So 1.1955 becomes 1.196.\n\n    However, let me check: \n        The number is 1.1955. \n        We want 3 decimals: \n          Look at the 4th decimal: 5 -> so we round up the 3rd decimal (which is 5) to 6? \n          Then we get 1.196.\n\n    Similarly, h19: 1.0585 -> \n        1.0585: \n          3rd decimal: 8, 4th decimal: 5 -> round up 8 to 9 -> 1.059.\n\n    h20: 1.11925 -> \n        1.11925: \n          3rd decimal: 9, 4th decimal: 2 -> so we don't round up? \n          Actually, 1.11925: \n            The 3rd decimal is 9, and the 4th is 2 -> so we leave the 9 -> 1.119.\n\n    But wait: 1.11925: \n        The 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5 -> so we leave the 3rd decimal as 9 -> 1.119.\n\n    h21: 1.04325 -> \n        1.04325: \n          3rd decimal: 3, 4th decimal: 2 -> leave as 1.043.\n\n    So the typical day with 3 decimals:\n\n        h0: 0.921\n        h1: 0.830\n        h2: 0.815\n        h3: 0.967\n        h4: 0.982\n        h5: 0.983\n        h6: 1.150\n        h7: 1.371\n        h8: 1.386\n        h9: 1.454\n        h10: 1.416\n        h11: 1.401\n        h12: 1.294\n        h13: 1.325\n        h14: 1.363\n        h15: 1.378\n        h16: 1.348\n        h17: 1.264\n        h18: 1.196\n        h19: 1.059\n        h20: 1.119\n        h21: 1.043\n        h22: 0.982\n        h23: 0.891\n\n25.
