        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2016-10-21 00:00:00 to 2016-10-24 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and may have missing values (though the provided 96 points are complete).\n 2. Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, we should be prepared to handle them. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the hourly data and the need to capture daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that handles seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models, but we can use a simple statistical model such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (24 hours) as the forecast for the next day.\n   - However, the data might have trends and multiple seasonality? But we have only 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model. But without the ability to run code, we have to rely on a simple method.\n\n Since the problem requires 96 points and we must provide the complete data, we will generate the forecast.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n Given the time and the requirement, we choose a simple method: \n   - We observe that the data has a daily pattern (24 hours). We can use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? \n     But we only have 4 days (96 hours). So we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the last day (2016-10-24) has a different pattern? Let's see:\n\n   Hour 0: 12.391, 11.454, 9.377, 10.717 -> average = (12.391+11.454+9.377+10.717)/4 = 11.0 (approx)\n   But we don't have a strong reason to believe that the next 4 days will be the average of the past 4 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-24) as the base and adjust by the trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n Given the simplicity, we can use a seasonal naive method: \n   - We use the same values as the previous day (2016-10-24) for the next day (2016-10-25), then the day after (2016-10-26) we use the values from 2016-10-23? \n   - But that might not be consistent.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days we have.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n   - We have 4 days: 2016-10-21, 2016-10-22, 2016-10-23, 2016-10-24.\n   - For hour 0: average of [12.391, 11.454, 9.377, 10.717] = (12.391+11.454+9.377+10.717)/4 = 10.98475\n   - Similarly for hour 1: [12.324, 9.578, 8.506, 9.980] -> (12.324+9.578+8.506+9.980)/4 = 10.097\n\n But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We don't have enough data to see weekly. We only have 4 days.\n\n However, the problem requires 96 points. We can generate 4 days of forecast by repeating the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n But wait: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not told that the next 96 will have missing, but we are to provide the complete data. So we will provide 96 numbers without missing.\n\n We'll create a list of 24 hourly averages from the 4 days, and then use that same pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n However, note: the data might have a trend? The last day (2016-10-24) seems to have higher values in the early hours and during the day? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-24) as the forecast for the next day (2016-10-25), then the day after (2016-10-26) we use the day before (2016-10-23) and so on? That doesn't make sense.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a model trained, we choose the average method.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (12.391 + 11.454 + 9.377 + 10.717) / 4 = 10.98475\n Hour 1: (12.324 + 9.578 + 8.506 + 9.980) / 4 = 10.097\n Hour 2: (12.726 + 9.310 + 8.172 + 10.047) / 4 = 10.06375\n Hour 3: (12.525 + 8.774 + 8.707 + 10.717) / 4 = 10.18075\n Hour 4: (12.726 + 6.899 + 7.234 + 10.918) / 4 = 9.44425\n Hour 5: (12.592 + 6.229 + 9.109 + 10.650) / 4 = 9.645\n Hour 6: (13.664 + 6.899 + 10.650 + 11.788) / 4 = 10.75025\n Hour 7: (14.200 + 8.908 + 11.588 + 13.731) / 4 = 12.10675\n Hour 8: (10.114 + 8.239 + 11.788 + 9.377) / 4 = 9.8795\n Hour 9: (7.837 + 7.837 + 9.578 + 15.070) / 4 = 7.837? Wait, let me recalc: \n        Actually, the 4 values: \n          2016-10-21 09:00:00: 7.837\n          2016-10-22 09:00:00: 7.837? Actually, 2016-10-22 09:00:00 is 7.837? \n          But looking: \n            2016-10-21 09:00:00: 7.837\n            2016-10-22 09:00:00: 7.837? Actually, the data for 2016-10-22 09:00:00 is 7.837? \n          But wait, the data provided for 2016-10-22 09:00:00 is 7.837? \n          Actually, the data for 2016-10-22 09:00:00 is 7.837? \n          The data: \n            2016-10-21 09:00:00  7.837000\n            2016-10-22 09:00:00  7.837000? \n          But wait, the data for 2016-10-22 09:00:00 is actually 7.837? \n          And 2016-10-23 09:00:00: 9.578? \n          And 2016-10-24 09:00:00: 15.070? \n          So: (7.837 + 7.837 + 9.578 + 15.070) / 4 = 10.0805\n\n We'll compute each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n However, note: the data for 2016-10-24 has a spike at hour 9 (15.070) which is much higher. This might be an outlier? \n But we are taking the average, so it will be smoothed.\n\n We'll compute the average for each hour and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says we must forecast the next 96 dates. We are going to generate 4 days of 24 hours each, each day being the same 24 averages? \n\n However, that would be a constant pattern for each day. But the data shows that the pattern changes? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-10-24) as the forecast for the next day (2016-10-25), then for 2016-10-26 we use the average of the last two days? \n\n But the problem requires 96 points. We must provide 96 numbers.\n\n Given the time, we decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour and then repeat that for 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   - Compute an array `avg_hourly` of length 24, where `avg_hourly[i]` is the average of the HUFL at hour i (i from 0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n   - Then, for the next 4 days (2016-10-25 to 2016-10-28), we set:\n        Day 1 (2016-10-25): hour0 = avg_hourly[0], hour1 = avg_hourly[1], ... hour23 = avg_hourly[23]\n        Day 2 (2016-10-26): same as Day1: hour0 to hour23 = avg_hourly[0] to avg_hourly[23]\n        Day 3 (2016-10-27): same\n        Day 4 (2016-10-28): same\n\n   - This gives 4*24 = 96 points.\n\n But note: the dates must be generated. The last date in the input is 2016-10-24 23:00:00. The next 96 dates are:\n        2016-10-25 00:00:00, 2016-10-25 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-28 23:00:00.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll compute the averages:\n\n   Hour 0: (12.391 + 11.454 + 9.377 + 10.717) / 4 = 10.98475\n   Hour 1: (12.324 + 9.578 + 8.506 + 9.980) / 4 = 10.097\n   Hour 2: (12.726 + 9.310 + 8.172 + 10.047) / 4 = 10.06375\n   Hour 3: (12.525 + 8.774 + 8.707 + 10.717) / 4 = 10.18075\n   Hour 4: (12.726 + 6.899 + 7.234 + 10.918) / 4 = 9.44425\n   Hour 5: (12.592 + 6.229 + 9.109 + 10.650) / 4 = 9.645\n   Hour 6: (13.664 + 6.899 + 10.650 + 11.788) / 4 = 10.75025\n   Hour 7: (14.200 + 8.908 + 11.588 + 13.731) / 4 = 12.10675\n   Hour 8: (10.114 + 8.239 + 11.788 + 9.377) / 4 = 9.8795\n   Hour 9: (7.837 + 7.837 + 9.578 + 15.070) / 4 = 10.0805\n   Hour 10: (8.774 + 8.105 + 10.650 + 16.209) / 4 = 10.9345\n   Hour 11: (8.774 + 9.042 + 10.382 + 18.553) / 4 = 11.68775\n   Hour 12: (5.961 + 6.564 + 7.368 + 14.200) / 4 = 8.52325\n   Hour 13: (6.832 + 6.966 + 8.707 + 13.597) / 4 = 9.0255\n   Hour 14: (8.439 + 7.569 + 8.306 + 15.740) / 4 = 10.0135\n   Hour 15: (8.172 + 8.172 + 8.908 + 15.204) / 4 = 10.114\n   Hour 16: (6.832 + 6.497 + 7.837 + 15.204) / 4 = 9.0925\n   Hour 17: (7.636 + 7.435 + 9.042 + 8.975) / 4 = 8.272\n   Hour 18: (7.234 + 6.832 + 7.368 + 7.435) / 4 = 7.21725\n   Hour 19: (6.832 + 6.631 + 6.832 + 7.033) / 4 = 6.832\n   Hour 20: (6.698 + 5.827 + 6.095 + 6.095) / 4 = 6.17875\n   Hour 21: (6.966 + 4.957 + 5.425 + 5.157) / 4 = 5.62625\n   Hour 22: (8.038 + 6.095 + 6.229 + 7.100) / 4 = 6.8655\n   Hour 23: (5.894 + 7.636 + 6.698 + 9.310) / 4 = 7.3845\n\n Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat these 24 values 4 times.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But we are to forecast the next 96 without missing? So we provide the 96 numbers.\n\n But wait: the problem says \"these data will have missing values, so be aware of that\". It might mean that the provided data has missing? But the provided 96 are complete. \n   So we assume the next 96 we are to forecast are complete.\n\n We'll generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-10-25 00:00:00, then hourly until 2016-10-28 23:00:00.\n\n Format: \n        date               HUFL\n        2016-10-25 00:00:00 10.98475\n        2016-10-25 01:00:00 10.097\n        ... \n\n But note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimals? \n\n The original data has 3 decimal places. So we round to 3.\n\n However, the problem does not specify the precision. We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n But note: the average might have more than 3 decimals. We round to 3.\n\n Let me recompute each average and round to 3 decimals:\n\n   Hour0: 10.98475 -> 10.985\n   Hour1: 10.097 -> 10.097 (exactly 10.097, so 10.097)\n   But wait, 10.097 is 10.097000, so we can write 10.097.\n\n However, let's do:\n\n   We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the exact average and then format to 6 digits after the decimal as in the input? \n   The input has 6 digits: e.g., 12.391000 -> but that's just formatting. We can output 3 decimal digits? \n\n   The input has 3 significant decimal digits? Actually, the numbers are given with 3 decimal digits and then three zeros? \n   We'll output with 6 decimal digits to match the input format? \n\n   The input: \n        2016-10-21 00:00:00 12.391000\n\n   So we output: 10.985000, 10.097000, etc.\n\n Steps for each hour:\n\n   We'll compute the average and then format to 6 decimal places.\n\n   Example: \n        Hour0: (12.391+11.454+9.377+10.717) = 43.939, then /4 = 10.98475 -> rounded to 6 decimals: 10.984750? \n        But the input has 3 decimal places and then 3 zeros. So we can output 10.984750? \n\n   However, the input numbers are given with 3 decimal places. The average might have more. We'll keep 6 decimal places.\n\n   Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places and then add 3 zeros? \n\n   Since the input has 6 digits after the decimal, we output 6 digits.\n\n   We'll compute the average and then format to 6 decimal places.\n\n   But note: the input numbers are multiples of 0.001? So the average might not be. We'll compute and then round to 6 decimals.\n\n   Actually, we can do: \n        value = round(avg, 6)\n\n   But we are doing by hand? We'll compute and then write with 6 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write without rounding the value? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   We'll output the exact average with 6 decimal representation.\n\n   Example: 10.98475 -> 10.984750\n\n   But let's do the computation and then represent with 6 decimals.\n\n   We'll compute each average and then write as:\n\n        Hour0: 10.984750\n        Hour1: 10.097000   (because 10.097 is 10.097000)\n\n   But wait, 10.097 is exact? Actually, 10.097 * 1000 = 10097, so it's exact. So we can write 10.097000.\n\n   However, for Hour0: 10.98475 -> we can write 10.984750.\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-10-25, hours 0 to 23: [10.984750, 10.097000, 10.063750, 10.180750, 9.444250, 9.645000, 10.750250, 12.106750, 9.879500, 10.080500, 10.934500, 11.687750, 8.523250, 9.025500, 10.013500, 10.114000, 9.092500, 8.272000, 7.217250, 6.832000, 6.178750, 5.626250, 6.865500, 7.384500]\n        Day2: 2016-10-26: same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2016-10-27: same\n        Day4: 2016-10-28: same\n\n   So we have 96 numbers.\n\n   We'll write the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-10-25 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-10-25 01:00:00, ... until 2016-10-25 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-10-26 00:00:00 ... until 2016-10-26 23:00:00\n        ... until 2016-10-28 23:00:00\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-25 00:00:00 10.984750\n2016-10-25 01:00:00 10.097000\n2016-10-25 02:00:00 10.063750\n... (and so on for 96 lines)\n```\n\n   But note: the date format: the input uses \"2016-10-21 00:00:00\", so we use the same.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        from 2016-10-25 00:00:00 to 2016-10-28 23:00:00, in steps of 1 hour.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        import datetime? (but we are not coding, we are writing)\n\n        We know:\n          2016-10-25: 24 hours -> 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n          2016-10-26: 24 hours\n          2016-10-27: 24 hours\n          2016-10-28: 24 hours\n\n   We write:\n\n        for day in [25,26,27,28]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = \"2016-10-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\".format(day=day, hour=hour)\n\n   But we are writing by hand? We have to list 96 lines.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a loop in the answer? But the problem says to output the data.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n        ... (96 lines)\n```\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   But 96 lines is long. We can write a program to generate? But we are in text.\n\n   We'll write the first few and the last few?
