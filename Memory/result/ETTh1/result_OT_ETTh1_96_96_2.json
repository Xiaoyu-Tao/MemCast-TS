        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of oil temperature.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points ahead, \n    we can consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet. However, note that the data shows:\n      - Daily seasonality: the temperature drops at night and rises during the day.\n      - Also, there might be a weekly pattern but we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we can use a model that can capture daily seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we can set the seasonality period to 24.\n\n 5. We choose to use the SARIMA model (Seasonal ARIMA) because it can handle seasonality and trends.\n\n 6. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We need to set the seasonal period: s=24 (for daily seasonality in hourly data).\n    - We will use auto_arima from pmdarima to find the best parameters (if available) or we can manually set a simple model.\n\n 7. However, note that we are in a simulated environment and cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a simple and reasonable model.\n\n 8. Given the data, we observe:\n    - The temperature has a daily cycle and also a slight upward trend in the last two days? \n    - But the data is only 4 days, so we cannot be sure of a trend. We might assume stationarity in the seasonal component.\n\n 9. We can use a simple seasonal model: SARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[24] or something similar. But without running an actual model, we have to simulate.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n      - The forecast for the same hour of the next day is the same as the previous day. But we have 4 days, so we can average the same hours of the past 4 days to get the next day.\n\n 11. However, the problem is we are forecasting 4 days (96 hours) ahead. We can use the following:\n      - For the first day of forecast (day 5: 2016-07-13), we can take the average of the same hour from the previous 4 days (if available) and then for the next days, we can use the same pattern but adjusted by the average of the last day? \n\n 12. But note: the data provided ends at 2016-07-12 23:00:00. We are to forecast from 2016-07-13 00:00:00 to 2016-07-16 23:00:00.\n\n 13. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days we have and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? \n     However, we see that the temperature might be increasing (for example, the peak on 2016-07-12 is higher than previous days). \n\n 14. Another idea: use the last day (2016-07-12) as the base and then adjust by the average change from the previous day? \n\n 15. Given the complexity and without running actual code, we decide to use a simple average of the same hour for the 4 days we have, and then use that for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 16. Steps for the simple method:\n      - For hour h (0 to 23), let:\n          avg_h = (OT_h of day1 + OT_h of day2 + OT_h of day3 + OT_h of day4) / 4\n      - Then for each day in the forecast period (4 days: 2016-07-13 to 2016-07-16), the hour h will be avg_h.\n\n 17. But note: the data starts at 2016-07-09 (Saturday) and ends at 2016-07-12 (Tuesday). The next 4 days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n 18. We don't have information about weekly seasonality, so we ignore the day of the week.\n\n 19. However, we see that the temperature on 2016-07-12 (Tuesday) is generally higher than the previous days. So if we average, we might lower the peak.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-07-12) as the forecast for the next day (2016-07-13) and then for the subsequent days, we can use the same pattern as the last day but with a small adjustment? \n\n 21. Since we are not running a model, we choose a simple method: use the average of the same hour for the last 4 days.\n\n 22. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 00:00: (30.952999 + 29.475000 + 28.561001 + 33.485001) / 4 = (30.952999+29.475+28.561001+33.485001)/4 = 122.473001/4 = 30.61825\n      Hour 01:00: (30.320000 + 29.334999 + 29.194000 + 33.695999) /4 = (30.32+29.334999+29.194+33.695999)/4 = 122.544998/4 = 30.63625\n\n 23. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 24. Then for each of the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 25. But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 26. We must output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 27. We must generate the dates: \n        Start: 2016-07-13 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-07-12 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-07-13 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-07-16 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We will compute the 24 hourly averages from the 4 days we have and then repeat these averages for 4 days.\n\n 29. However, note that the pattern might be changing. But without a model, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n      We have 4 days: \n        Day1: 2016-07-09 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day2: 2016-07-10 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day3: 2016-07-11 (index 48 to 71)\n        Day4: 2016-07-12 (index 72 to 95)\n\n      For hour 0 (00:00): indices 0, 24, 48, 72\n        values: 30.952999, 29.475000, 28.561001, 33.485001 -> average = (30.952999+29.475000+28.561001+33.485001)/4 = 122.473001/4 = 30.61825025\n\n      Hour 1 (01:00): indices 1, 25,49,73\n        values: 30.320000, 29.334999, 29.194000, 33.695999 -> average = (30.32+29.334999+29.194+33.695999)/4 = 122.544998/4 = 30.6362495\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 31. We compute all 24 averages.\n\n 32. Then for the forecast:\n        Day5 (2016-07-13): hour0 to hour23: use the 24 averages we computed.\n        Day6 (2016-07-14): same 24 averages (repeated)\n        Day7 (2016-07-15): same\n        Day8 (2016-07-16): same\n\n 33. This method assumes that the daily pattern is stable and the average over the past 4 days is the best estimate.\n\n 34. However, note that the temperature on the last day (2016-07-12) was higher. But without a trend component, we are averaging.\n\n 35. We proceed to compute the 24 averages.\n\n 36. We list the indices for each hour:\n\n      hour0: [0,24,48,72] -> [30.952999, 29.475000, 28.561001, 33.485001] -> avg = 30.61825025\n      hour1: [1,25,49,73] -> [30.320000, 29.334999, 29.194000, 33.695999] -> avg = 30.6362495\n      hour2: [2,26,50,74] -> [29.405001, 29.827000, 28.561001, 33.556000] -> avg = (29.405001+29.827+28.561001+33.556)/4 = 121.349002/4 = 30.3372505\n      hour3: [3,27,51,75] -> [28.702000, 29.124001, 29.264000, 33.344002] -> avg = (28.702+29.124001+29.264+33.344002)/4 = 120.434003/4 = 30.10850075\n      hour4: [4,28,52,76] -> [28.771999, 28.561001, 29.052999, 32.993000] -> avg = (28.771999+28.561001+29.052999+32.993)/4 = 119.378999/4 = 29.84474975\n      hour5: [5,29,53,77] -> [28.913000, 28.631001, 28.913000, 33.344002] -> avg = (28.913+28.631001+28.913+33.344002)/4 = 119.801003/4 = 29.95025075\n      hour6: [6,30,54,78] -> [28.278999, 27.506001, 29.827000, 33.907001] -> avg = (28.278999+27.506001+29.827+33.907001)/4 = 119.519001/4 = 29.87975025\n      hour7: [7,31,55,79] -> [28.631001, 27.506001, 29.827000, 33.203999] -> avg = (28.631001+27.506001+29.827+33.203999)/4 = 119.168001/4 = 29.79200025\n      hour8: [8,32,56,80] -> [28.771999, 28.068001, 29.194000, 34.188999] -> avg = (28.771999+28.068001+29.194+34.188999)/4 = 120.223/4 = 30.05575\n      hour9: [9,33,57,81] -> [29.968000, 29.615999, 30.882000, 35.946999] -> avg = (29.968+29.615999+30.882+35.946999)/4 = 126.412998/4 = 31.6032495\n      hour10: [10,34,58,82] -> [29.757000, 29.475000, 31.233999, 36.368999] -> avg = (29.757+29.475+31.233999+36.368999)/4 = 126.834998/4 = 31.7087495\n      hour11: [11,35,59,83] -> [30.320000, 29.052999, 32.219002, 36.088001] -> avg = (30.32+29.052999+32.219002+36.088001)/4 = 127.679002/4 = 31.9197505\n      hour12: [12,36,60,84] -> [31.445000, 29.475000, 32.993000, 36.088001] -> avg = (31.445+29.475+32.993+36.088001)/4 = 130.001001/4 = 32.50025025\n      hour13: [13,37,61,85] -> [30.742001, 29.124001, 33.907001, 36.229000] -> avg = (30.742001+29.124001+33.907001+36.229)/4 = 130.002003/4 = 32.50050075\n      hour14: [14,38,62,86] -> [31.656000, 29.686001, 34.750999, 38.409000] -> avg = (31.656+29.686001+34.750999+38.409)/4 = 134.502/4 = 33.6255\n      hour15: [15,39,63,87] -> [32.289001, 31.023001, 34.750999, 39.605000] -> avg = (32.289001+31.023001+34.750999+39.605)/4 = 137.667001/4 = 34.41675025\n      hour16: [16,40,64,88] -> [32.852001, 31.164000, 34.891998, 40.520000] -> avg = (32.852001+31.164+34.891998+40.52)/4 = 139.428/4 = 34.857\n      hour17: [17,41,65,89] -> [32.077999, 30.671000, 34.891998, 40.520000] -> avg = (32.077999+30.671+34.891998+40.52)/4 = 138.160997/4 = 34.54024925\n      hour18: [18,42,66,90] -> [31.867001, 29.968000, 33.344002, 37.847000] -> avg = (31.867001+29.968+33.344002+37.847)/4 = 133.026003/4 = 33.25650075\n      hour19: [19,43,67,91] -> [31.375000, 30.179001, 31.656000, 37.354000] -> avg = (31.375+30.179001+31.656+37.354)/4 = 130.564001/4 = 32.64100025\n      hour20: [20,44,68,92] -> [30.882000, 29.475000, 33.485001, 36.018002] -> avg = (30.882+29.475+33.485001+36.018002)/4 = 129.860003/4 = 32.46500075\n      hour21: [21,45,69,93] -> [30.882000, 29.405001, 32.640999, 36.158001] -> avg = (30.882+29.405001+32.640999+36.158001)/4 = 129.086001/4 = 32.27150025\n      hour22: [22,46,70,94] -> [29.968000, 28.209000, 32.500000, 36.018002] -> avg = (29.968+28.209+32.5+36.018002)/4 = 126.695002/4 = 31.6737505\n      hour23: [23,47,71,95] -> [29.968000, 29.124001, 33.063000, 36.229000] -> avg = (29.968+29.124001+33.063+36.229)/4 = 128.384001/4 = 32.09600025\n\n 37.
