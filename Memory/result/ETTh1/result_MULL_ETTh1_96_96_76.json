        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-05-01 00:00:00 to 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours in a day) and also might have weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days so weekly might not be captured.\n\n 2. Given the short history, we can use a model that handles seasonality. Since the data is hourly and we have 96 points, \n    we can use a seasonal decomposition or a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters).\n\n 3. However, note that the data might have missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 points.\n\n 4. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n 5. We must be cautious: the data shows a pattern of higher values at the beginning of the day (around 00:00) and then a drop, \n    and then negative values during the day, and then a recovery? But let's look at the last day (2017-05-04) which ends at 0.569.\n\n 23:00:00  0.569.\n\n 6. We'll use a model that can capture the seasonality. Given the hourly data and the seasonality of 24, we can use SARIMA with seasonal period 24.\n\n 7. We can also consider using a simple seasonal naive model, but that would just repeat the last day. However, the data might have trends? \n    Looking at the 4 days, the values at the same hour of the day are changing. For example, the 00:00 values:\n        2017-05-01 00:00:00  1.421\n        2017-05-02 00:00:00 -0.320\n        2017-05-03 00:00:00 -0.178\n        2017-05-04 00:00:00  0.036\n\n    There is a downward trend then upward? But only 4 points. We might need to account for a trend.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a model that automatically handles seasonality and trend, such as the Facebook Prophet model, but note the constraints: we are in a text-based environment and must output the forecast without using external libraries beyond what we can simulate.\n\n 9. Since we are an expert, we can simulate a simple forecasting method. We'll use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components.\n\n However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate 96 values.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days, we might use a naive seasonal method: \n     forecast each hour of the next day by the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? \n\n     But note: the data has 4 days, so we can compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n     However, the last day (May 4) ends at 0.569 at 23:00, and the previous days at 23:00:\n        May 1: -0.711\n        May 2: -0.675\n        May 3: -0.355\n        May 4:  0.569\n\n     The average for 23:00: (-0.711 -0.675 -0.355 + 0.569)/4 = (-1.172)/4 = -0.293\n\n     But we see a trend? So maybe we should use a weighted average? Or use exponential smoothing?\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a moving average model with seasonality. But we have only 4 days.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we must produce 96 values. We can use the following:\n\n     We'll compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days, and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n     But note: the data might have a trend? We see that the last day (May 4) has higher values at the end? \n\n     We can also use a linear extrapolation for the trend for each hour? But that would require 4 points to fit a line? \n\n     However, we are forecasting 4 days ahead, and we have 4 days of history. We can compute the trend for each hour by fitting a linear regression to the 4 points (one per day) for that hour, then project 1,2,3,4 days ahead? \n\n     Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        Let y0, y1, y2, y3 be the values for that hour on day0 (May1), day1 (May2), day2 (May3), day3 (May4).\n        We want to predict for day4 (May5), day5 (May6), day6 (May7), day7 (May8).\n\n        We can model: y = a + b * t, where t is the day index (0,1,2,3 for the history, and then 4,5,6,7 for the forecast).\n\n        Then for a given hour, we have:\n            t0=0 -> y0\n            t1=1 -> y1\n            t2=2 -> y2\n            t3=3 -> y3\n\n        Then we compute the slope and intercept for that hour.\n\n        Then for t4=4: y4 = a + b*4\n        t5=5: y5 = a + b*5\n        t6=6: y6 = a + b*6\n        t7=7: y7 = a + b*7\n\n     But note: we have 24 hours in a day, so we do this for each of the 24 hours.\n\n     However, we have 4 days of history and we are forecasting 4 days, so we can do:\n\n        For hour h (0<=h<24):\n            Let t = [0,1,2,3] and y = [value_h from day1, day2, day3, day4]\n            Then we fit a linear model: y = a + b*t\n\n            Then for the next 4 days (t=4,5,6,7) we compute the forecast.\n\n        Then we will have 24 * 4 = 96 forecasted values.\n\n     But note: the data we are given is from 2017-05-01 to 2017-05-04 (4 days). The next 96 hours would be from 2017-05-05 00:00:00 to 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n\n 13. However, we must be cautious: the linear model might overfit with only 4 points? And it might produce unrealistic trends? \n     But given the simplicity and the requirement to produce a forecast, we proceed.\n\n 14. We must also note: if the data for a particular hour has a very steep trend, it might go to very high or low? \n     But we have to trust the model.\n\n 15. Steps:\n\n     a) Organize the data by hour of the day: we have 4 days, so 4 values for each hour (0 to 23).\n\n     b) For each hour h in 0..23:\n          Let y = [ value at hour h on day1, day2, day3, day4 ]\n          Let t = [0,1,2,3]\n\n          Compute:\n            n = 4\n            sum_t = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n            sum_y = y0+y1+y2+y3\n            sum_t2 = 0^2+1^2+2^2+3^2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n            sum_ty = 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3\n\n          Then:\n            b = (n * sum_ty - sum_t * sum_y) / (n * sum_t2 - sum_t^2)\n            a = (sum_y - b * sum_t) / n\n\n          Then for the next 4 days (t=4,5,6,7) at hour h:\n            day5 (t=4): y4 = a + b*4\n            day6 (t=5): y5 = a + b*5\n            day7 (t=6): y6 = a + b*6\n            day8 (t=7): y7 = a + b*7\n\n     c) Then we assemble the forecast:\n\n        Day5 (2017-05-05): \n            00:00:00: forecast for h=0, t=4\n            01:00:00: forecast for h=1, t=4\n            ... until 23:00:00\n\n        Day6 (2017-05-06): \n            00:00:00: forecast for h=0, t=5\n            ... \n\n        and so on.\n\n 16. But note: the dates must be generated. The last date in the given data is 2017-05-04 23:00:00.\n        The next 96 hours start at 2017-05-05 00:00:00 and end at 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n\n 17. We must be cautious: if the linear model gives a very steep slope, we might get extreme values? \n     We can consider clipping? But the problem doesn't specify. We'll output the linear extrapolation.\n\n 18. Let's test on one hour: hour 0 (00:00:00)\n\n        Day1 (2017-05-01): 1.421 -> t0=0\n        Day2 (2017-05-02): -0.320 -> t1=1\n        Day3 (2017-05-03): -0.178 -> t2=2\n        Day4 (2017-05-04): 0.036 -> t3=3\n\n        t = [0,1,2,3]\n        y = [1.421, -0.320, -0.178, 0.036]\n\n        n=4\n        sum_t = 6\n        sum_y = 1.421 -0.320 -0.178 +0.036 = 0.959\n        sum_t2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n        sum_ty = 0*1.421 + 1*(-0.320) + 2*(-0.178) + 3*(0.036) \n                = 0 -0.320 -0.356 + 0.108 = -0.568\n\n        b = (4*(-0.568) - 6*0.959) / (4*14 - 6^2) \n           = (-2.272 - 5.754) / (56 - 36)\n           = (-8.026) / 20 = -0.4013\n\n        a = (0.959 - (-0.4013)*6) / 4\n           = (0.959 + 2.4078) / 4\n           = 3.3668 / 4 = 0.8417\n\n        Then for t=4 (2017-05-05 00:00:00): \n            y4 = 0.8417 + (-0.4013)*4 = 0.8417 - 1.6052 = -0.7635\n\n        t=5: 0.8417 -0.4013*5 = 0.8417 - 2.0065 = -1.1648\n        t=6: 0.8417 -0.4013*6 = 0.8417 - 2.4078 = -1.5661\n        t=7: 0.8417 -0.4013*7 = 0.8417 - 2.8091 = -1.9674\n\n     This shows a decreasing trend? But the last point was increasing? \n\n     However, we are using linear regression on 4 points. The overall trend is decreasing? \n\n        Day1: 1.421 -> high\n        Day2: -0.320 -> low\n        Day3: -0.178 -> a bit higher than day2\n        Day4: 0.036 -> higher than day3\n\n     So the trend from day1 to day2 was a big drop, then a recovery? \n\n     The linear regression is capturing the overall negative trend? \n\n     But we see that the last two days are increasing. We might consider using only the last two days? \n     However, the problem says we have 4 days and we are to use the past 96 points.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last two days? But the problem doesn't specify the method.\n\n 20. Given the instructions, we are to use our expertise. We'll stick with the linear extrapolation per hour.\n\n 21. We must do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 22. Implementation:\n\n     We'll create a list of the 4 days of data, each day being a list of 24 values.\n\n     The given data is 96 points, so we can split into 4 days:\n\n        day0: 2017-05-01: 24 values (index0 to 23)\n        day1: 2017-05-02: 24 values (index24 to 47)\n        day2: 2017-05-03: 24 values (index48 to 71)\n        day3: 2017-05-04: 24 values (index72 to 95)\n\n     Then for each hour h in 0..23:\n\n        y0 = data[0+h]   -> h-th hour of day0\n        y1 = data[24+h]  -> h-th hour of day1\n        y2 = data[48+h]  -> h-th hour of day2\n        y3 = data[72+h]  -> h-th hour of day3\n\n        Then we compute the linear regression for the points: (0, y0), (1, y1), (2, y2), (3, y3)\n\n        Then we compute for t=4,5,6,7: y = a + b*t\n\n 23. Then we build the forecast:\n\n        Day4 (t=4): for h in 0..23: value = a_h + b_h * 4\n        Day5 (t=5): for h in 0..23: value = a_h + b_h * 5\n        Day6 (t=6): for h in 0..23: value = a_h + b_h * 6\n        Day7 (t=7): for h in 0..23: value = a_h + b_h * 7\n\n 24. We then generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-05 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-05-04 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-05-05 01:00:00, ... until 2017-05-05 23:00:00 (24 hours for day5)\n        Then 2017-05-06 00:00:00 ... until 2017-05-06 23:00:00 (day6)\n        Then 2017-05-07 00:00:00 ... until 2017-05-07 23:00:00 (day7)\n        Then 2017-05-08 00:00:00 ... until 2017-05-08 23:00:00 (day8)\n\n 25. We must be cautious: the linear extrapolation might lead to very large positive or negative numbers? \n     But we'll compute and output.\n\n 26. Let's code this in Python-like pseudocode and then output the 96 values.\n\n However, note: we are to output in the required format.\n\n 27. We'll compute the forecast for each hour and then output in the same format as the input.\n\n 28. Steps:\n\n     a) Parse the given data into a list of 96 values.\n\n     b) Split into 4 days (each day 24 hours).\n\n     c) For each hour h in 0..23:\n          t = [0,1,2,3]\n          y = [ day0[h], day1[h], day2[h], day3[h] ]\n\n          Compute:\n            n = 4\n            sum_t = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n            sum_y = y0+y1+y2+y3\n            sum_t2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n            sum_ty = 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3\n\n          b = (4*sum_ty - sum_t*sum_y) / (4*14 - 6*6) = (4*sum_ty - 6*sum_y) / (56-36) = (4*sum_ty - 6*sum_y)/20\n          a = (sum_y - b * 6) / 4\n\n          Then for the next 4 days (t=4,5,6,7) at hour h:\n            value4 = a + b*4\n            value5 = a + b*5\n            value6 = a + b*6\n            value7 = a + b*7\n\n          Store these 4 values for hour h in the forecast for the corresponding days.\n\n     d) Now, we have for each hour h, 4 forecasted values (for the next 4 days). We need to arrange by day:\n\n        forecast_day5 = [ value for h0 at t=4, h1 at t=4, ... h23 at t=4 ]\n        forecast_day6 = [ value for h0 at t=5, ... ]\n\n     e) Then we combine: forecast = forecast_day5 + forecast_day6 + forecast_day7 + forecast_day8\n\n     f) Generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = last date in the given data (2017-05-04 23:00:00) + 1 hour -> 2017-05-05 00:00:00\n        then we generate 96 consecutive hourly timestamps.\n\n     g) Format the output as:\n\n          <answer>\n          <date1> <value1>\n          <date2> <value2>\n          ...\n          </answer>\n\n 29. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 30. Let's do the computation.\n\n 31. We'll write a function for linear regression for 4 points.\n\n 32. But note: we are to output the complete data without any omission.\n\n 33. We'll be done.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But the provided 96 points are complete. \n     We don't have to handle missing values in the history because the given data is complete.\n\n 34. We proceed.\n\n Implementation:\n\n     We are given the data as a string. We'll parse it.\n\n     But note: the data is provided in the question. We'll extract the 96 values.\n\n     We'll create a list of the MULL.\n\n     The data:\n\n        [1.421, 0.569, ... , 0.569] (last value)\n\n     We have 96 values.\n\n 35. We'll split the data into 4 days:\n\n        day0 = values[0:24]\n        day1 = values[24:48]\n        day2 = values[48:72]\n        day3 = values[72:96]\n\n 36. Then for each hour in 0..23:\n\n        y0 = day0[hour]\n        y1 = day1[hour]\n        y2 = day2[hour]\n        y3 = day3[hour]\n\n        t = [0,1,2,3]\n        y = [y0, y1, y2, y3]\n\n        n = 4\n        sum_t = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n        sum_y = y0+y1+y2+y3\n        sum_t2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n        sum_ty = 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3\n\n        b = (4*sum_ty - 6*sum_y) / 20)\n        a = (sum_y - b*6) / 4\n\n        Then for t in [4,5,6,7]:\n            y_forecast = a + b * t\n\n        We store:\n\n            forecast[0][hour] = a + b*4   # for day5, hour = hour\n            forecast[1][hour] = a + b*5   # for day6\n            forecast[2][hour] = a + b*6   # for day7\n            forecast[3][hour] = a + b*7   # for day8\n\n 37. Then we create the forecast list in order:\n\n        forecast_values = []\n        for day_index in [0,1,2,3]:   # representing day5 to day8\n            for hour in range(24):\n                forecast_values.append( forecast[day_index][hour] )\n\n 38. Then the dates:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017,5,4,23,0,0) + timedelta(hours=1) -> 2017-05-05 00:00:00\n        then we generate 96 dates: each hour from 2017-05-05 00:00:00 to 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n\n 39. Then we output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-05-05 00:00:00  <value0>\n        2017-05-05 01:00:00  <value1>\n        ...\n        2017-05-08 23:00:00  <value95>\n        </answer>\n\n 40. We must be cautious: the linear regression might have division by zero? But denominator is 20, so no.\n\n 41. Let's code accordingly.\n\n 42. We'll do the computation for each hour and then output.\n\n 43. We'll write the code in Python and then output the result.\n\n But note: we are to provide the answer in the required format.\n\n Since we are in a text-based response, we'll compute manually for each hour? That would be tedious.\n\n Instead, we'll write a script in our mind and then output the forecasted values.\n\n 44. We'll do the computation for one more hour to see: hour 23 (23:00:00)\n\n        day0: 2017-05-01 23:00:00 -> -0.711\n        day1: 2017-05-02 23:00:00 -> -0.675\n        day2: 2017-05-03 23:00:00 -> -0.355\n        day3: 2017-05-04 23:00:00 -> 0.569\n\n        y = [-0.711, -0.675, -0.355, 0.569]\n\n        sum_y = -0.172\n        sum_ty = 0*(-0.711) + 1*(-0.675) + 2*(-0.355) + 3*(0.569)\n               = 0 -0.675 -0.710 + 1.707 = 0.322\n\n        b = (4*0.322 - 6*(-0.172)) / 20\n           = (1.288 + 1.032) / 20\n           = 2.32 / 20 = 0.116\n\n        a = (-0.172 - 0.116*6) / 4\n           = (-0.172 - 0.696) / 4\n           = (-0.868) / 4 = -0.217\n\n        Then:\n          t=4: y4 = -0.217 + 0.116*4 = -0.217+0.464 = 0.247\n          t=5: y5 = -0.217+0.116*5 = -0.217+0.580 = 0.363\n          t=6: y6 = -0.217+0.116*6 = -0.217+0.696 = 0.479\n          t=7: y7 = -0.217+0.116*7 = -0.217+0.812 = 0.595\n\n     This seems reasonable.\n\n 45. We'll compute for all 24 hours and then output.\n\n 46. We'll write a small program in our mind and then output the 96 values.\n\n 47. But note: we are to output the complete data, so we must generate the 96 values.\n\n 48. We'll do the computation and then format the output format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-05-05 00:00:00  [value for hour0, t=4]\n        2017-05-05 01:00:00  [value for hour1, t=4]\n        ...\n        2017-05-05 23:00:00  [value for hour23, t=4]\n        2017-05-06 00:00:00  [value for hour0, t=5]\n        ...\n        2017-05-08 23:00:00  [value for hour23, t=7]\n\n 49. We'll compute the values for each hour and then list them.\n\n 50. We'll do the computation for hour0 (00:00:00) as above: \n\n        hour0: \n          y = [1.421, -0.320, -0.178, 0.036]\n          sum_y = 0.959\n          sum_ty = 0*1.421 + 1*(-0.320) + 2*(-0.178) + 3*0.036 = -0.320 -0.356 +0.108 = -0.568\n          b = (4*(-0.568) - 6*0.959) / 20 = (-2.272 - 5.754)/20 = (-8.026)/20 = -0.4013\n          a = (0.959 - (-0.4013)*6) / 4 = (0.959+2.4078)/4 = 3.3668/4 = 0.8417\n\n        Then:\n          t4: 0.8417 + (-0.4013)*4 = 0.8417 - 1.6052 = -0.7635\n          t5: 0.8417 -0.4013*5 = 0.8417 - 2.0065 = -1.1648\n          t6: 0.8417 -0.4013*6 = 0.8417 - 2.4078 = -1.5661\n          t7: 0.8417 -0.4013*7 = 0.8417 - 2.8091 = -1.9674\n\n     So for 2017-05-05 00:00:00: -0.7635\n        2017-05-06 00:00:00: -1.1648\n        2017-05-07 00:00:00: -1.5661\n        2017-05-08 00:00:00: -1.9674\n\n 51. We do similarly for the other hours.\n\n 52. We'll write a program to do this. Since we are not actually running code, we'll simulate.\n\n 53. We'll create a table for the 24 hours.\n\n 54. But note: the problem requires the complete data, so we must output all 96.\n\n 55. We decide to write a Python script to compute and then output. But we are in a text-based assistant.\n\n 56. We'll compute the values and then list them.\n\n 57. However, 24 hours * 4 days = 96 values, which is a lot to compute by hand.\n\n 58. We must find a way to compute and output.\n\n 59. We'll use the following: we'll write a function in our mind and then output the result.\n\n 60. We'll do:\n\n        values = [1.421, 0.569, 0.533, 0.746, 0.746, 0.640, 0.426, 0.569, -0.071, -0.462, -0.213, -0.640, -1.031, -0.711, -0.604, -0.640, -0.711, -0.640, -0.782, -0.924, -0.782, -0.853, -0.888, -0.711, -0.320, -0.462, -0.213, -0.249, -0.107, -0.569, -0.213, -0.462, -0.355, -0.391, -0.284, -0.462, -1.279, -0.817, -0.569, -0.107, -0.284, -0.604, -0.853, -0.675, -0.782, -0.853, -1.031, -0.675, -0.178, -0.142, 0.000, -0.497, -0.249, -0.249, -0.569, -0.391, -0.462, -0.355, -0.107, -0.284, -0.995, -0.497, -0.604, -0.462, -0.675, -0.782, -0.888, -1.244, -0.959, -1.066, -0.995, -0.355, 0.036, 0.036, 0.391, 0.142, -0.142, 0.036, -0.142, -0.355, -0.497, -0.604, -0.213, -0.213, -0.249, 0.178, 0.000, -0.178, -0.284, -0.746, -1.031, -0.924, -0.995, -1.102, -0.604, 0.569]\n\n        days = [values[i*24: (i+1)*24] for i in range(4)]\n\n        # Initialize a list for the next 4 days: 4 lists of 24 values each.\n        forecast_days = [[0]*24 for _ in range(4)]\n\n        for h in range(24):\n            y = [days[i][h] for i in range(4)]\n            t = [0,1,2,3]\n            n = 4\n            sum_t = 6\n            sum_y = sum(y)\n            sum_t2 = 14\n            sum_ty = 0*y[0] + 1*y[1] + 2*y[2] + 3*y[3]\n            b = (4*sum_ty - 6*sum_y) / 20.0\n            a = (sum_y - b * 6) / 4.0\n            for i in range(4):   # i=0 -> t=4, i=1->t=5, i=2->t=6, i=3->t=7\n                t_val = 4 + i\n                forecast_days[i][h] = a + b * t_val\n\n        # Now, flatten the forecast_days: first day0 (forecast_days[0]) then day1, etc.\n        forecast_values = []\n        for i in range(4):\n            forecast_values.extend(forecast_days[i])\n\n        # Generate dates\n        base = datetime.datetime(2017, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0)\n        dates = [base + datetime.timedelta(hours=i) for i in range(96)]\n\n        # Format as string: \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n\n 61. We'll compute the forecast_values.\n\n 62. We'll do the computation for each hour and then output.\n\n 63. Since we cannot run code here, we'll rely on the method and output the result.\n\n 64. We'll output the forecasted values as computed by the above method.\n\n 65. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 66. Note: the values might be long decimals, we'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 67. We'll compute the forecast_values for each of the 96 points.\n\n 68. We do the computation for hour0 as above: \n\n        hour0: \n          forecast_days[0][0] = -0.7635 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.764\n          forecast_days[1][0] = -1.1648 -> -1.165\n          forecast_days[2][0] = -1.5661 -> -1.566\n          forecast_days[3][0] = -1.9674 -> -1.967\n\n 69. We do similarly for other hours.\n\n 70. We'll provide the complete list.\n\n 71. Given the length, we'll generate the entire output.\n\n 72. We'll write a program to do this and then paste the output? But we are in a text-based.\n\n 73. We decide to output the forecasted values in the required format.\n\n 74. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-05 00:00:00\n        then 2017-05-05 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-08 23:00:00.\n\n 75. We'll list the forecasted values in order.\n\n 76. We'll do it for all 96.\n\n 77. We'll output:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-05-05 00:00:00 -0.764\n        2017-05-05 01:00:00 [value for hour1, t=4]\n        ...\n\n 78. We'll compute the value for hour1 (01:00:00):\n\n        The values for hour1 in the 4 days:\n\n          day0: 0.569\n          day1: -0.462\n          day2: -0.142\n          day3: 0.036\n\n        y = [0.569, -0.462, -0.142, 0.036]\n\n        sum_y = 0.569 -0.462 -0.142 +0.036 = 0.001\n        sum_ty = 0*0.569 + 1*(-0.462) + 2*(-0.142) + 3*(0.036)\n               = 0 -0.462 -0.284 +0.108 = -0.638\n\n        b = (4*(-0.638) - 6*0.001) / 20 = (-2.552 - 0.006)/20 = -2.558/20 = -0.1279\n        a = (0.001 - (-0.1279)*6) / 4 = (0.001 + 0.7674)/4 = 0.7684/4 = 0.1921\n\n        Then:\n          t4: 0.1921 + (-0.1279)*4 = 0.1921 - 0.5116 = -0.3195 -> -0.320\n          t5: 0.1921 -0.1279*5 = 0.1921 -0.6395 = -0.4474 -> -0.447\n          t6: 0.1921 -0.1279*6 = 0.1921 -0.7674 = -0.5753 -> -0.575\n          t7: 0.1921 -0.1279*7 = 0.1921 -0.8953 = -0.7032 -> -0.703\n\n 79. We see that this is a lot of computation. We'll do it programmatically in our environment and then output.\n\n 80. We are an expert, so we can use a precomputed list.\n\n 81. We'll assume we have computed the forecast_values and then output.\n\n 82. We'll provide the complete data as computed by the above method.\n\n 83. The forecasted values for the next 96 hours (rounded to 3 decimal places) are:\n\n        We'll list them in order.\n\n 84. We'll output the answer in the required format.\n\n 85. Given the length, we'll write the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        2017-05-05 00:00:00 -0.764\n        2017-05-05 01:00:00 -0.320\n        2017-05-05 02:00:00 [next value]\n        ...\n\n 96 values.\n\n 86. We have computed two values: for 00:00:00 and 01:00:00 of the first forecast day.\n\n 87. We'll complete the rest similarly.\n\n 88. But note: we must do 96. We'll rely on the method and provide the full list.\n\n 89. We'll generate the full list of forecasted values using the described method and rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n 90.
