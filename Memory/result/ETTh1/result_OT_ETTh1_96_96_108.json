        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00) for Oil Temperature (OT).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data for the past 96 dates does not have missing values? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", however, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values? \n    So we assume that the provided history is complete, but the future might have missing? However, the task is to forecast the next 96 dates without missing.\n\n 2. We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates (which are hourly, so 96 hours).\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of history, we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality (24 hours).\n\n 4. We can use models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple moving average. However, given the data, we can try to fit a model.\n\n 5. Given the constraints of the problem and that we are to provide a complete answer, we will use a simple method to forecast.\n\n 6. However, note: the data about load metrics is not provided? The problem says the dataset records oil temperature and load, but we are only given OT. \n    So we will only use OT.\n\n 7. We are to forecast 96 points. We can use a model that handles seasonality. Since we are in an expert setting, we can use a model like SARIMA.\n\n 8. Steps for modeling:\n    - Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    - The data shows a daily pattern? Let's look: \n        The temperature seems to have a daily cycle (higher during the day, lower at night? but note: in the provided data, we see fluctuations).\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to generate 96 points, we can use a simple approach: \n    - We can use the last 4 days (96 points) to compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n    However, this would ignore any trend and recent changes.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the same hour in the past few days. But we only have 4 days.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the average of the same hour in the available 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 4 days? \n\n 12. But note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided history we don't have missing? So we assume the history is complete.\n\n 13. We are to forecast the next 96 hours. We can use:\n\n     Forecast for hour h (where h from 0 to 23) of day 5 = average of hour h of day1, day2, day3, day4.\n\n     Then for day 6, same? But that would be the same as day5? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n 15. Given the constraints, we will use the following:\n\n     Let the history be:\n        Day1: 2017-09-06 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day2: 2017-09-07 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day3: 2017-09-08 (index 48 to 71)\n        Day4: 2017-09-09 (index 72 to 95)\n\n     For each hour of the day (0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00) we compute the average over the 4 days.\n\n     Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 16. But note: there might be a trend? We can also compute the overall average and then adjust by a linear trend? \n     However, 4 days is too short to estimate a trend. \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and then adjust by the average hourly deviation from the previous days? \n\n 18. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days.\n\n 19. Steps:\n        For h in 0..23:\n            values = [OT[h], OT[24+h], OT[48+h], OT[72+h]]\n            avg_h = mean(values)\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days for hour h will be:\n            day5, hour h: avg_h\n            day6, hour h: avg_h\n            day7, hour h: avg_h\n            day8, hour h: avg_h\n\n 20. But note: the last day in history is 2017-09-09, so the next day is 2017-09-10, then 11, 12, 13.\n\n 21. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 22. However, we must be cautious: the data provided ends at 2017-09-09 23:00:00. The next hour is 2017-09-10 00:00:00.\n\n 23. We generate 96 hours from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00.\n\n 24. But note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", which are consecutive hours.\n\n 25. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: [15.265, 15.758, 14.984, 14.491] -> (15.265+15.758+14.984+14.491)/4 = 15.1245\n        hour1: [14.280, 14.984, 14.914, 13.999] -> (14.280+14.984+14.914+13.999)/4 = 14.54425\n        ... and so on.\n\n 26. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 27. Then the forecast for 2017-09-10 00:00:00 is the average for hour0, 2017-09-10 01:00:00 is the average for hour1, ... until 2017-09-10 23:00:00 (which is hour23), and then repeat the same 24 hours for the next 3 days.\n\n 28. However, this method ignores any trend and might be too simplistic. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 29. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. But without more historical data, it's challenging.\n\n 30. We'll go with the hourly average method.\n\n 31. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (15.265000 + 15.758000 + 14.984000 + 14.491000) / 4 = 15.1245\n        hour1: (14.280000 + 14.984000 + 14.914000 + 13.999000) / 4 = 14.54425\n        hour2: (15.898000 + 14.843000 + 14.914000 + 13.436000) / 4 = 14.77275\n        hour3: (15.969000 + 15.476000 + 14.843000 + 13.788000) / 4 = 15.019\n        hour4: (15.125000 + 14.914000 + 14.632000 + 13.577000) / 4 = 14.562\n        hour5: (16.391001 + 14.069000 + 13.718000 + 13.085000) / 4 = 14.31575\n        hour6: (15.476000 + 14.280000 + 13.507000 + 13.788000) / 4 = 14.26275\n        hour7: (16.039000 + 14.703000 + 12.874000 + 13.929000) / 4 = 14.38625\n        hour8: (16.532000 + 14.914000 + 13.296000 + 14.984000) / 4 = 14.9315\n        hour9: (16.601999 + 14.351000 + 13.155000 + 15.054000) / 4 = 14.7905\n        hour10: (16.320999 + 15.617000 + 14.351000 + 16.250000) / 4 = 15.63475\n        hour11: (15.969000 + 15.969000 + 14.632000 + 15.547000) / 4 = 15.52925\n        hour12: (16.391001 + 16.391001 + 15.476000 + 16.108999) / 4 = 16.0915\n        hour13: (13.718000 + 17.024000 + 16.039000 + 16.250000) / 4 = 15.75775\n        hour14: (12.100000 + 17.024000 + 16.461000 + 17.305000) / 4 = 15.7225\n        hour15: (14.843000 + 18.219999 + 16.601999 + 17.094000) / 4 = 16.68975\n        hour16: (14.843000 + 16.601999 + 17.305000 + 17.375999) / 4 = 16.5315\n        hour17: (14.843000 + 18.079000 + 16.954000 + 16.954000) / 4 = 16.7075\n        hour18: (14.914000 + 17.375999 + 16.882999 + 15.476000) / 4 = 16.16225\n        hour19: (16.039000 + 15.828000 + 15.758000 + 14.280000) / 4 = 15.47625\n        hour20: (15.898000 + 15.547000 + 15.547000 + 14.140000) / 4 = 15.283\n        hour21: (15.476000 + 15.758000 + 14.914000 + 14.210000) / 4 = 15.0895\n        hour22: (16.039000 + 15.336000 + 14.984000 + 13.647000) / 4 = 15.0015\n        hour23: (15.406000 + 15.476000 + 14.140000 + 13.296000) / 4 = 14.5795\n\n 32. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-10: [15.1245, 14.54425, 14.77275, 15.019, 14.562, 14.31575, 14.26275, 14.38625, 14.9315, 14.7905, 15.63475, 15.52925, 16.0915, 15.75775, 15.7225, 16.68975, 16.5315, 16.7075, 16.16225, 15.47625, 15.283, 15.0895, 15.0015, 14.5795]\n        Day2: 2017-09-11: same as above\n        Day3: 2017-09-12: same as above\n        Day4: 2017-09-13: same as above\n\n 33. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are to provide the complete data. So we are providing 96 points without missing.\n\n 34. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,OT\n        2017-09-10 00:00:00,15.1245\n        2017-09-10 01:00:00,14.54425\n        ... \n        2017-09-13 23:00:00,14.5795\n\n        </answer>\n\n 35. However, we must note that the original data had 3 decimal places? We can round to 3 decimal places? \n     The original data had up to 3 decimal places (but some are 0). We'll output with 6 decimal places as in the input? \n     But the input had 6 decimal places? Actually, the input had 6 digits after the decimal? \n\n     Example: 15.265000 -> 6 digits.\n\n     We'll output with 6 digits.\n\n 36. But note: our computed values are averages and might have more than 3 decimal places. We'll round to 6 decimal places? Actually, we can keep as is.\n\n 37. However, the problem says \"complete data\", so we output the numbers as we computed.\n\n 38. But to match the input format, we can output with 6 decimal places.\n\n 39. We'll format each number to have 6 decimal places.\n\n 40. Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-10 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-10 01:00:00, ... until 2017-09-10 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-09-11 00:00:00 ... until 2017-09-11 23:00:00\n        ... until 2017-09-13 23:00:00\n\n 41. We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n 42. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 43. However, note: the problem says the data is subdivided into four mini-datasets and sampled hourly or every 15 minutes. But the provided data is hourly. So we output hourly.\n\n 44. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns, with the first column being the datetime and the second the OT.\n\n 45. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 46. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 47. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,OT\n        2017-09-10 00:00:00,15.124500\n        2017-09-10 01:00:00,14.544250\n        ... \n\n 48. We use the computed averages for each hour and repeat the same 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 49. However, note: the problem says \"the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 consecutive hours.\n\n 50. We generate the dates by starting from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 and then adding 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n 51. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 52. But we are writing by hand? We can compute:\n\n        Day0: 2017-09-10: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day1: 2017-09-11: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day2: 2017-09-12: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Day3: 2017-09-13: 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n\n 53. We have the OT values for each hour of the day (0 to 23) as computed above, and we repeat the same list for each day.\n\n 54. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 55. Let's write the first few:\n\n        date,OT\n        2017-09-10 00:00:00,15.124500\n        2017-09-10 01:00:00,14.544250\n        2017-09-10 02:00:00,14.772750\n        2017-09-10 03:00:00,15.019000\n        2017-09-10 04:00:00,14.562000\n        2017-09-10 05:00:00,14.315750\n        2017-09-10 06:00:00,14.262750\n        2017-09-10 07:00:00,14.386250\n        2017-09-10 08:00:00,14.931500\n        2017-09-10 09:00:00,14.790500\n        2017-09-10 10:00:00,15.634750\n        2017-09-10 11:00:00,15.529250\n        2017-09-10 12:00:00,16.091500\n        2017-09-10 13:00:00,15.757750\n        2017-09-10 14:00:00,15.722500\n        2017-09-10 15:00:00,16.689750\n        2017-09-10 16:00:00,16.531500\n        2017-09-10 17:00:00,16.707500\n        2017-09-10 18:00:00,16.162250\n        2017-09-10 19:00:00,15.476250\n        2017-09-10 20:00:00,15.283000\n        2017-09-10 21:00:00,15.089500\n        2017-09-10 22:00:00,15.001500\n        2017-09-10 23:00:00,14.579500\n\n        Then for 2017-09-11, same values for each hour.\n\n 56. We write the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n 57. We output the entire 96 rows.\n\n 58. We note that this is a simple average and may not be the most accurate, but with the limited data and the requirement to provide a complete answer, we proceed.\n\n 59. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 60. Note: the problem says \"Please obey the format strictly\". The format is:\n\n        <answer>\n        [data in CSV format? or just two columns?]\n\n     The example input was:\n\n               date        OT\n        2017-09-06 00:00:00 15.265000\n\n     But we are to output in the same way? However, the problem says:\n\n        \"And your final answer must follow the format\n        <answer>\n\n        ...\n\n        </answer>\"\n\n     And the example input was given as two columns with space separated? But the example we are to output should be the same? \n\n     Actually, the input was given as:\n\n        \"2017-09-06 00:00:00 15.265000\"\n\n     But in the problem statement, it was printed as a table? \n\n     We'll output: one row per line, with the date string and then the OT value (with 6 decimal places) separated by a space? \n\n     However, the example input in the problem statement was:\n\n        \"               date        OT\n        2017-09-06 00:00:00 15.265000\"\n\n     So we output without the word \"date\" and \"OT\", just the data.\n\n 61. We output:\n\n        [date string] [OT value with 6 decimal places]\n\n 62. We'll write:\n\n        2017-09-10 00:00:00 15.124500\n\n 63. We do this for all 96 rows.\n\n 64. We note: the original data had the OT as floats with 6 decimal places? So we output with 6.\n\n 65. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 66. We must be cautious: the dates must be consecutive and correct.\n\n 67. We generate:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-09-10 (from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00) -> 24 lines\n        Day 2: 2017-09-11 (from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00) -> 24 lines\n        Day 3: 2017-09-12 (from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00) -> 24 lines\n        Day 4: 2017-09-13 (from 00:00:00 to 23:00:00) -> 24 lines\n\n 68. We use the same 24 OT values for each day.\n\n 69. We write the answer.\n\n 70. However, note: the problem says \"the dataset records oil temperature and load metrics\", but we are only forecasting OT? \n     we are not given load for the future? So we only output OT.\n\n 71. We output only the two columns: date and OT.\n\n 72. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 73. Let's do it.\n",
