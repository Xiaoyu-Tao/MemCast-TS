        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-29 00:00:00 to 2017-06-01 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-06-02 00:00:00 to 2017-06-05 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours in a day). The pattern: \n    - Temperatures during the night (until early morning) are relatively high (positive, around 4-7).\n    - Then in the morning (around 7-8 AM) there is a drop, becoming negative during the day (especially around 10 AM to 3 PM) and then rising again in the evening.\n\n 2. However, we also observe that the data for 2017-05-31 is constant (4.406) for the entire day. This might be an anomaly or missing data that was filled with a constant. But since we are to forecast, we must account for such patterns.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the need for a forecast, we will use a time series model that can handle seasonality. Since we are to provide a forecast without any model training details, we can use a simple approach: \n    - We can use the average of the previous days (excluding the constant day) to form a typical day pattern and then adjust for the last known values.\n\n 4. But note: the data for 2017-05-31 (all 4.406) is likely an error. We might consider excluding it or treating it as missing. However, the problem says the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious.\n\n 5. We have 4 days of data: \n    Day 1: 2017-05-29 (Monday) -> 24 hours\n    Day 2: 2017-05-30 (Tuesday) -> 24 hours\n    Day 3: 2017-05-31 (Wednesday) -> constant (so we might skip this for pattern)\n    Day 4: 2017-06-01 (Thursday) -> 24 hours\n\n 6. We can create a seasonal pattern by averaging the non-constant days (Day1, Day2, Day4) for each hour of the day.\n\n 7. However, we note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days. So we rely on daily seasonality.\n\n 8. Steps for forecasting:\n    a. We will take the last day (2017-06-01) and use it as a base, then adjust by the typical daily pattern relative to that day? \n    b. Alternatively, we can compute the average of the three valid days (29th, 30th, and 1st) for each hour and use that as the forecast for the next days.\n\n 9. But note: the next 96 hours are the next 4 days (from June 2 to June 5). We don't know if there is a weekly pattern (like weekends) but we don't have enough data to capture that.\n\n10. Approach:\n    - We will compute the hourly average for the three non-constant days (May 29, May 30, June 1) for each hour (0 to 23).\n    - Then we will use this average pattern for the next 4 days (June 2, 3, June4, June5).\n\n11. However, we must account for the fact that the last day (June 1) might be the most recent and thus more relevant? But without more data, we use the average.\n\n12. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We have to be cautious. The provided data for May 31 is constant and likely missing. We will ignore it for the pattern.\n\n13. Let's compute the hourly profile:\n\n    For hour 0: (5.899 + 6.219 + 6.254) / 3 = 6.124\n    For hour 1: (6.219 + 6.148 + 5.934) / 3 = 6.100333\n    ... and so on.\n\n14. However, we note that the next day (June 2) is a Friday, then Saturday, Sunday, Monday. But we don't have data for previous weekends. So we assume the pattern holds.\n\n15. Therefore, we will generate 4 days of data by repeating the computed average daily pattern for 4 times.\n\n16. But wait: the last day (June 1) ended at 4.762. We might want to adjust the starting point of the next day? However, the pattern we are using is an average. Alternatively, we can use the last day (June 1) and then for the next days use the average pattern but shifted? \n\n17. Since we are not given the context of the model, and to keep it simple, we will use the average pattern for the last three days (excluding the constant day) for the next 4 days.\n\n18. Steps to compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the three days:\n\n    We have:\n        Day1: 2017-05-29 (index 0 to 23)\n        Day2: 2017-05-30 (index 24 to 47)\n        Day3: 2017-06-01 (index 72 to 95)   [Note: 2017-05-31 is 48 to 71, which is constant, so skip]\n\n    We'll create an array for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [5.899, 6.219, 6.254] -> avg = (5.899+6.219+6.254)/3 = 6.124\n        hour1: [6.219, 6.148, 5.934] -> (6.219+6.148+5.934)/3 = 6.100333\n        ... \n\n19. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n20. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (4 days) is the 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n21. However, note that the last value of the given data (2017-06-01 23:00:00) is 4.762. The average for hour23 is computed from the three days: \n        Day1: 6.219, Day2: 4.655, Day3: 4.762 -> (6.219+4.655+4.762)/3 = 5.212\n\n    So the next hour (2017-06-02 00:00:00) would be 6.124, which is a jump from 4.762. That might be acceptable because the pattern shows that at 00:00 the value is typically higher.\n\n22. We'll proceed with this method.\n\n23. Compute the average for each hour:\n\n    hour0: [5.899, 6.219, 6.254] -> 6.124\n    hour1: [6.219, 6.148, 5.934] -> 6.100333 -> rounded to 6.100\n    hour2: [6.041, 6.432, 6.467] -> (6.041+6.432+6.467)/3 = 6.313333 -> 6.313\n    hour3: [7.285, 4.300, 7.285] -> (7.285+4.300+7.285)/3 = 6.290 -> 6.290\n    hour4: [5.863, 6.325, 7.676] -> (5.863+6.325+7.676)/3 = 6.621333 -> 6.621\n    hour5: [6.752, 6.467, 8.244] -> (6.752+6.467+8.244)/3 = 7.154333 -> 7.154\n    hour6: [7.356, 6.503, 4.868] -> (7.356+6.503+4.868)/3 = 6.242333 -> 6.242\n    hour7: [3.269, 2.843, 4.691] -> (3.269+2.843+4.691)/3 = 3.601 -> 3.601\n    hour8: [-1.990, -2.345, 1.777] -> (-1.990-2.345+1.777)/3 = -0.852667 -> -0.853\n    hour9: [-7.711, -0.355, -1.492] -> (-7.711-0.355-1.492)/3 = -3.186 -> -3.186\n    hour10: [-10.696, 0.533, -6.148] -> (-10.696+0.533-6.148)/3 = -5.437 -> -5.437\n    hour11: [-12.295, -7.533, -14.250] -> (-12.295-7.533-14.250)/3 = -11.359333 -> -11.359\n    hour12: [-14.534, -3.802, -14.250] -> (-14.534-3.802-14.250)/3 = -10.862 -> -10.862\n    hour13: [-13.965, -5.792, -13.539] -> (-13.965-5.792-13.539)/3 = -11.098667 -> -11.099\n    hour14: [-10.874, 0.249, -4.229] -> (-10.874+0.249-4.229)/3 = -4.951333 -> -4.951\n    hour15: [-6.219, 1.777, -8.706] -> (-6.219+1.777-8.706)/3 = -4.382667 -> -4.383\n    hour16: [-0.284, 4.087, -4.406] -> (-0.284+4.087-4.406)/3 = -0.201 -> -0.201\n    hour17: [-1.741, 3.696, 1.457] -> (-1.741+3.696+1.457)/3 = 1.137333 -> 1.137\n    hour18: [3.340, 3.767, 3.127] -> (3.340+3.767+3.127)/3 = 3.411333 -> 3.411\n    hour19: [4.335, 4.122, 5.472] -> (4.335+4.122+5.472)/3 = 4.643 -> 4.643\n    hour20: [5.153, 4.548, 6.325] -> (5.153+4.548+6.325)/3 = 5.342 -> 5.342\n    hour21: [4.939, 4.158, 5.686] -> (4.939+4.158+5.686)/3 = 4.927667 -> 4.928\n    hour22: [4.655, 3.767, 4.655] -> (4.655+3.767+4.655)/3 = 4.359 -> 4.359\n    hour23: [6.219, 4.655, 4.762] -> (6.219+4.655+4.762)/3 = 5.212 -> 5.212\n\n24. Now, we have the 24-hour pattern. We will use this pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n25. The next 96 hours start at 2017-06-02 00:00:00 and go to 2017-06-05 23:00:00.\n\n26. We generate:\n\n    Day 1: 2017-06-02\n        00:00:00 -> 6.124\n        01:00:00 -> 6.100\n        02:00:00 -> 6.313\n        03:00:00 -> 6.290\n        04:00:00 -> 6.621\n        05:00:00 -> 7.154\n        06:00:00 -> 6.242\n        07:00:00 -> 3.601\n        08:00:00 -> -0.853\n        09:00:00 -> -3.186\n        10:00:00 -> -5.437\n        11:00:00 -> -11.359\n        12:00:00 -> -10.862\n        13:00:00 -> -11.099\n        14:00:00 -> -4.951\n        15:00:00 -> -4.383\n        16:00:00 -> -0.201\n        17:00:00 -> 1.137\n        18:00:00 -> 3.411\n        19:00:00 -> 4.643\n        20:00:00 -> 5.342\n        21:00:00 -> 4.928\n        22:00:00 -> 4.359\n        23:00:00 -> 5.212\n\n    Then repeat the same pattern for the next three days.\n\n27.
