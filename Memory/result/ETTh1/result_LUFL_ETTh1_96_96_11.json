        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00) for the \"LUFL\" (Low UseFul Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some level of non-stationarity.\n 2. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points ahead, we need a model that can capture seasonality and trends.\n 3. We are also told that the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a seasonal time series model. Given the hourly data and the daily seasonality (period=24), we can consider:\n   - Seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components (trend, seasonality, residual) but with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model like Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive or multiplicative seasonality) or SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA).\n\n However, note that we have only 4 days (96 points) and we are forecasting 4 days (96 points). This is a challenge.\n\n Let's analyze the data pattern:\n   - The data shows a daily pattern: low during the night, rising in the morning, peak in the afternoon, and then a drop in the evening with a peak at night (around 20:00-21:00) and then drop again.\n   - The values at the same hour of the day are somewhat similar but not exactly.\n\n Given the constraints, we choose a model that can handle seasonality and is robust for short series.\n\n We'll use:\n   - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing with additive seasonality (since the seasonal variation seems roughly constant) and a seasonality period of 24.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   - Fit a Holt-Winters model on the 96 points with seasonality period 24.\n   - Forecast the next 96 points.\n\n However, we are not coding but simulating the output. We must generate the next 96 data points.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n How to simulate the forecast without actual computation?\n   - We can describe the pattern: \n        The daily pattern: \n          - The lowest values are around 3:00-5:00 (around 3.0 to 3.5)\n          - Then it rises to a first peak around 12:00-14:00 (around 5.0 to 5.7)\n          - Then a dip in the afternoon (around 15:00-16:00) and then a rise to a higher peak in the evening (around 20:00) (around 6.0 to 7.4)\n          - Then a drop at night.\n\n   - We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then adjust for a possible trend? But the trend over 4 days is not clear.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can take the last day (2016-08-17) and use it as a base, but that might not capture the weekly pattern? However, we don't have weekly data.\n\n   - Since we only have 4 days, we can assume that the pattern repeats daily. But note: the values are not exactly the same each day.\n\n   - We can compute the average for each hour of the day and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n   Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (4.721 + 7.280 + 4.934 + 4.630) / 4 = (4.721+7.280=12.001; 12.001+4.934=16.935; 16.935+4.630=21.565) /4 = 5.39125\n        Hour 1: (4.325+6.671+4.234+4.386)/4 = (4.325+6.671=10.996; 10.996+4.234=15.23; 15.23+4.386=19.616) /4 = 4.904\n        ... and so on.\n\n   But note: the data for the first day (2016-08-14) is a Sunday? and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? We don't have the day of week. However, the problem does not specify any weekly seasonality and we only have 4 days.\n\n   Given the lack of context, we assume the pattern is daily.\n\n   However, we note that the first day (Sunday) might be different from weekdays? But we don't have enough data to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the 4 days to compute the average for each hour and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the next 4 days are from 2016-08-18 (Thursday) to 2016-08-21 (Sunday). We don't know if the pattern for Sunday is different. However, we only have one Sunday in the training (2016-08-14) and the rest are weekdays? Actually, 2016-08-14 is Sunday? Let me check:\n\n        2016-08-14: Sunday? (I can check: 2016-08-15 is Monday, so 2016-08-14 is correct for Sunday)\n\n        So the training data:\n            Day0: Sunday (2016-08-14)\n            Day1: Monday (2016-08-15)\n            Day2: Tuesday (2016-08-16)\n            Day3: Wednesday (2016-08-17)\n\n        The forecast period:\n            Day4: Thursday (2016-08-18)\n            Day5: Friday (2016-08-19)\n            Day6: Saturday (2016-08-20)\n            Day7: Sunday (2016-08-21)\n\n        We have only one Sunday in the training and one of each weekday? Not enough to model weekly seasonality.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the average might smooth out the pattern and we lose the variation. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Wednesday) for Thursday, and then the Sunday in the training for the next Sunday? But we don't have data for Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we stick to the average.\n\n   Steps for generating the forecast:\n\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average = (value_day0 + value_day1 + value_day2 + value_day3) / 4.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign:\n            Day4 (Thursday): [average0, average1, ... average23]\n            Day5 (Friday): [average0, average1, ... average23]\n            Day6 (Saturday): [average0, average1, ... average23]\n            Day7 (Sunday): [average0, average1, ... average23]\n\n   However, we note that the Sunday in the training (day0) had a pattern that might be different from weekdays? But without more data, we cannot adjust.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) for Thursday, Friday, Saturday and then use the Sunday of the training for the next Sunday? But that would be:\n\n        For Thursday, Friday, Saturday: use the average of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday for each hour.\n        For Sunday: use the Sunday data.\n\n   But note: we are forecasting 4 days: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. We have:\n        Sunday (2016-08-14) as the only Sunday.\n\n   So for the next Sunday (2016-08-21) we can use the same values as 2016-08-14? But that might not be accurate because the load might be affected by other factors.\n\n   However, the problem does not provide any exogenous variables.\n\n   Given the simplicity and the data available, we choose the method of averaging the 4 days for each hour.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (4.721 + 7.280 + 4.934 + 4.630) / 4 = 5.39125\n        Hour 1: (4.325 + 6.671 + 4.234 + 4.386) / 4 = 4.904\n        Hour 2: (4.142 + 6.214 + 3.746 + 3.868) / 4 = 4.4925\n        Hour 3: (3.746 + 5.726 + 3.686 + 3.503) / 4 = 4.16525\n        Hour 4: (3.472 + 5.909 + 3.320 + 3.107) / 4 = 3.952\n        Hour 5: (3.472 + 5.848 + 3.229 + 3.107) / 4 = 3.914\n        Hour 6: (3.290 + 5.909 + 3.290 + 3.320) / 4 = 3.95225\n        Hour 7: (3.137 + 5.848 + 3.046 + 2.254) / 4 = 3.57125\n        Hour 8: (3.533 + 3.503 + 3.320 + 2.863) / 4 = 3.30475\n        Hour 9: (3.655 + 3.411 + 3.625 + 3.442) / 4 = 3.53325\n        Hour 10: (4.417 + 4.386 + 4.142 + 4.173) / 4 = 4.2795\n        Hour 11: (4.965 + 4.721 + 4.599 + 4.538) / 4 = 4.70575\n        Hour 12: (5.330 + 4.995 + 4.904 + 4.599) / 4 = 4.957\n        Hour 13: (5.696 + 5.269 + 5.726 + 5.422) / 4 = 5.52825\n        Hour 14: (5.178 + 4.995 + 5.361 + 5.330) / 4 = 5.216\n        Hour 15: (4.782 + 4.965 + 4.904 + 4.934) / 4 = 4.89625\n        Hour 16: (4.752 + 4.508 + 4.477 + 4.599) / 4 = 4.584\n        Hour 17: (4.691 + 4.477 + 4.477 + 4.295) / 4 = 4.485\n        Hour 18: (4.264 + 4.447 + 4.447 + 4.264) / 4 = 4.3555\n        Hour 19: (4.630 + 4.995 + 4.934 + 4.660) / 4 = 4.80475\n        Hour 20: (6.914 + 7.006 + 7.402 + 7.006) / 4 = 7.082\n        Hour 21: (6.671 + 6.396 + 6.518 + 6.731) / 4 = 6.579\n        Hour 22: (6.092 + 5.604 + 5.879 + 5.940) / 4 = 5.87875\n        Hour 23: (5.361 + 5.300 + 5.330 + 5.300) / 4 = 5.32275\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-08-18, Thursday): \n            00:00:00 -> 5.39125\n            01:00:00 -> 4.904\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 5.32275\n\n        Day2 (2016-08-19, Friday): same 24 values\n        Day3 (2016-08-20, Saturday): same 24 values\n        Day4 (2016-08-21, Sunday): same 24 values\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are generating a complete forecast. We are not given any missing values in the training, so we assume the forecast is complete.\n\n   However, we must format the dates correctly.\n\n   The last date in the given data is 2016-08-17 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        2016-08-18 00:00:00\n        2016-08-18 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-08-18 23:00:00  -> 24 hours for day1\n        2016-08-19 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-08-19 23:00:00  -> day2\n        2016-08-20 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-08-20 23:00:00  -> day3\n        2016-08-21 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-08-21 23:00:00  -> day4\n\n   We will generate 96 rows.\n\n   We must output the numbers with 3 decimal places?

In practice, one might use a model that can capture the trend and seasonality more robustly, but with only 4 days, it's challenging.\n\n   We output the data in the required format.\n\n   Let's write the entire 96 rows.\n",
