        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of Middle Useful Load (MUFL) from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (with 24-hour seasonality) and also some intra-day variations.\n 2. There are missing values? In the provided data, we see zeros and non-zero values. However, the zeros might be actual values (like during the night hours) and not necessarily missing. But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious.\n\n However, looking at the provided data, we don't see any explicit missing values (like NaN). But note the zeros: \n   - From 00:00 to 07:00 on 2016-12-08, we have zeros. Then at 08:00 it jumps to 4.335. This might be normal (low usage at night) or could be missing? \n   But the problem says \"missing values\", so we must handle them. However, in the provided 96 points, we don't have any NaN. So we assume the zeros are valid.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We'll use a time series model that can handle seasonality.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data is hourly and has daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a seasonal model. Given the small data (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: but it might not capture trends.\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model.\n\n However, note that the data has:\n   - A daily pattern: low at night, then peaks during the day? But looking at the data, the pattern is not very consistent. For example, on 2016-12-08, the peak is at 23:00 (7.96) and 00:00 the next day (11.087). \n   - Also, the values on 2016-12-09 and 2016-12-10 are different.\n\n Given the complexity and the need for a forecast, we can try to fit a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any) and seasonality.\n\n But note: we only have 4 days of data. This is very limited. We might not be able to capture weekly seasonality (7 days) because we don't have a week of data.\n\n We'll use a model that uses 24-hour seasonality.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n   - Preprocessing: check for missing values. In the given data, we don't have missing values (all zeros are present). But if there are missing values in the data we are given, we would have to impute. However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any. So we proceed.\n\n   - We can use a seasonal decomposition to see the components, but with 4 days, it's limited.\n\n   - We'll use a SARIMA model. We need to choose parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q,24).\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, without the ability to run code, we must rely on patterns.\n\n Observation:\n   The data shows:\n     - Each day, the load starts low at night (around 0 to 6) and then during the day it fluctuates between 2 and 11.\n     - The pattern is not exactly the same every day, but there are similarities.\n\n   We can try to take the average of the same hour across the 4 days and then adjust for any trend? But 4 days is too short to see a trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-12-11) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n   However, the problem requires 96 points. We are to forecast the next 4 days (from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00).\n\n   But note: the last provided data point is 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n\n   We can use a naive seasonal forecast: use the same values as the same hour of the previous day. But that would be using 2016-12-11 for 2016-12-12, then 2016-12-12 for 2016-12-13? But we don't have 2016-12-12.\n\n   Alternatively, we can average the same hour over the 4 available days and use that as the forecast for each hour of the next 4 days.\n\n   Let's do:\n\n        For hour h (where h from 0 to 23), we have 4 values: \n            day1: h0, day2: h1, day3: h2, day4: h3.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h of the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) would be the average of [h0, h1, h2, h3].\n\n   But note: the data we have is for 4 consecutive days: 2016-12-08, 09, 10, 11.\n\n   However, the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any missing. So we can use the average.\n\n   But let's check: the data for 00:00:\n        2016-12-08 00:00:00 -> 0.000\n        2016-12-09 00:00:00 -> 11.087\n        2016-12-10 00:00:00 -> 6.538\n        2016-12-11 00:00:00 -> 8.031\n        Average = (0 + 11.087 + 6.538 + 8.031) / 4 = 25.656/4 = 6.414\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, every 00:00 we forecast 6.414.\n\n   Similarly for 01:00:\n        0.000, 10.270, 6.787, 7.924 -> (0+10.270+6.787+7.924)/4 = 24.981/4 = 6.24525\n\n   And so on.\n\n   However, this method ignores any trend and also the fact that the next days might be different (like if there is a weekly pattern, but we don't have weekly data).\n\n   But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) with seasonality, but without code we cannot fit.\n\n   Given the constraints, we'll use the average by hour.\n\n   Steps:\n        Step 1: Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Step 2: For the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n   But note: the data starts at 2016-12-08 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-12-11 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n   However, the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, we don't have any. So we use the available 4 days.\n\n   But what if the zeros are missing? The problem says \"be aware\", but in the context, the zeros are at night and then during the day they are non-zero. So it's likely that the zeros are valid (low usage). So we include them.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (0.000, 11.087, 6.538, 8.031) -> 6.414\n        Hour 1: (0.000, 10.270, 6.787, 7.924) -> 6.24525\n        Hour 2: (0.000, 9.559, 6.005, 8.031) -> 5.89875\n        Hour 3: (0.000, 9.808, 6.396, 8.564) -> 6.192\n        Hour 4: (0.000, 9.559, 6.148, 9.417) -> 6.281\n        Hour 5: (0.000, 8.528, 6.503, 8.564) -> 5.89875\n        Hour 6: (0.000, 7.320, 6.219, 8.138) -> 5.41925\n        Hour 7: (0.000, 6.965, 7.640, 9.097) -> 5.9255\n        Hour 8: (4.335, 6.858, 8.173, 8.742) -> 7.027\n        Hour 9: (0.000, 3.944, 6.290, 5.863) -> 4.02425\n        Hour 10: (4.158, 4.371, 6.396, 5.934) -> 5.21475\n        Hour 11: (3.411, 5.010, 6.823, 7.143) -> 5.59675\n        Hour 12: (2.487, 3.305, 5.188, 4.620) -> 3.9\n        Hour 13: (2.878, 3.447, 5.863, 4.868) -> 4.264\n        Hour 14: (2.843, 3.696, 5.650, 5.010) -> 4.29975\n        Hour 15: (4.193, 4.300, 5.721, 5.401) -> 4.90375\n        Hour 16: (5.863, 3.234, 5.579, 5.792) -> 5.117\n        Hour 17: (5.721, 3.731, 6.183, 5.828) -> 5.36575\n        Hour 18: (5.437, 6.610, 5.508, 5.579) -> 5.7835\n        Hour 19: (5.046, 6.076, 5.224, 5.188) -> 5.3835\n        Hour 20: (4.691, 4.442, 4.584, 4.762) -> 4.61975\n        Hour 21: (4.193, 6.005, 3.980, 6.148) -> 5.0815\n        Hour 22: (6.929, 5.828, 7.640, 7.320) -> 6.92925\n        Hour 23: (7.960, 5.970, 8.493, 9.168) -> 7.89775\n\n   Then the next 4 days (from 2016-12-12 to 2016-12-15) will have:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-12-12): \n            00:00: 6.414\n            01:00: 6.24525\n            ... until 23:00: 7.89775\n\n        Day 2 (2016-12-13): same as above, the same 24 averages repeated.\n\n        Day 3 (2016-12-14): same.\n\n        Day 4 (2016-12-15): same.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not given any in the history, so we use the average. And for the forecast, we are providing the average for each hour.\n\n   However, we must format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, MUFL\n        2016-12-12 00:00:00, [value]\n        2016-12-12 01:00:00, [value]\n        ...\n        2016-12-15 23:00:00, [value]\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   Let's compute the averages and round:\n\n        Hour0: 6.414\n        Hour1: 6.245 -> 6.245 (but let's compute exactly: 0+11.087+6.538+8.031=25.656 -> 25.656/4=6.414 -> 6.414)\n        We'll compute each and round to 3 decimals.\n\n   We'll create a list of the 24 averages:\n\n        h0: (0.000 + 11.087 + 6.538 + 8.031) / 4 = 25.656 / 4 = 6.414\n        h1: (0.000 + 10.270 + 6.787 + 7.924) / 4 = 24.981 / 4 = 6.24525 -> 6.245\n        h2: (0.000 + 9.559 + 6.005 + 8.031) / 4 = 23.595 / 4 = 5.89875 -> 5.899\n        h3: (0.000 + 9.808 + 6.396 + 8.564) / 4 = 24.768 / 4 = 6.192\n        h4: (0.000 + 9.559 + 6.148 + 9.417) / 4 = 25.124 / 4 = 6.281\n        h5: (0.000 + 8.528 + 6.503 + 8.564) / 4 = 23.595 / 4 = 5.89875 -> 5.899\n        h6: (0.000 + 7.320 + 6.219 + 8.138) / 4 = 21.677 / 4 = 5.41925 -> 5.419\n        h7: (0.000 + 6.965 + 7.640 + 9.097) / 4 = 23.702 / 4 = 5.9255 -> 5.926\n        h8: (4.335 + 6.858 + 8.173 + 8.742) / 4 = 28.108 / 4 = 7.027\n        h9: (0.000 + 3.944 + 6.290 + 5.863) / 4 = 16.097 / 4 = 4.02425 -> 4.024\n        h10: (4.158 + 4.371 + 6.396 + 5.934) / 4 = 20.859 / 4 = 5.21475 -> 5.215\n        h11: (3.411 + 5.010 + 6.823 + 7.143) / 4 = 22.387 / 4 = 5.59675 -> 5.597\n        h12: (2.487 + 3.305 + 5.188 + 4.620) / 4 = 15.6 / 4 = 3.9\n        h13: (2.878 + 3.447 + 5.863 + 4.868) / 4 = 17.056 / 4 = 4.264\n        h14: (2.843 + 3.696 + 5.650 + 5.010) / 4 = 17.199 / 4 = 4.29975 -> 4.300\n        h15: (4.193 + 4.300 + 5.721 + 5.401) / 4 = 19.615 / 4 = 4.90375 -> 4.904\n        h16: (5.863 + 3.234 + 5.579 + 5.792) / 4 = 20.468 / 4 = 5.117\n        h17: (5.721 + 3.731 + 6.183 + 5.828) / 4 = 21.463 / 4 = 5.36575 -> 5.366\n        h18: (5.437 + 6.610 + 5.508 + 5.579) / 4 = 23.134 / 4 = 5.7835 -> 5.784\n        h19: (5.046 + 6.076 + 5.224 + 5.188) / 4 = 21.534 / 4 = 5.3835 -> 5.384\n        h20: (4.691 + 4.442 + 4.584 + 4.762) / 4 = 18.479 / 4 = 4.61975 -> 4.620\n        h21: (4.193 + 6.005 + 3.980 + 6.148) / 4 = 20.326 / 4 = 5.0815 -> 5.082\n        h22: (6.929 + 5.828 + 7.640 + 7.320) / 4 = 27.717 / 4 = 6.92925 -> 6.929\n        h23: (7.960 + 5.970 + 8.493 + 9.168) / 4 = 31.591 / 4 = 7.89775 -> 7.898\n\n   Now, we'll generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-12 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-15 23:00:00.\n\n   And assign the values:\n\n        For 2016-12-12 00:00:00 -> h0: 6.414\n        For 2016-12-12 01:00:00 -> h1: 6.245\n        ... \n        For 2016-12-12 23:00:00 -> h23: 7.898\n\n        Then 2016-12-13 00:00:00 -> h0: 6.414\n        and so on.\n\n   We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n   Note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we must not omit any.\n\n   Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-12-12 00:00:00  6.414\n        2016-12-12 01:00:00  6.245\n        2016-12-12 02:00:00  5.899\n        2016-12-12 03:00:00  6.192\n        2016-12-12 04:00:00  6.281\n        2016-12-12 05:00:00  5.899\n        2016-12-12 06:00:00  5.419\n        2016-12-12 07:00:00  5.926\n        2016-12-12 08:00:00  7.027\n        2016-12-12 09:00:00  4.024\n        2016-12-12 10:00:00  5.215\n        2016-12-12 11:00:00  5.597\n        2016-12-12 12:00:00  3.900\n        2016-12-12 13:00:00  4.264\n        2016-12-12 14:00:00  4.300\n        2016-12-12 15:00:00  4.904\n        2016-12-12 16:00:00  5.117\n        2016-12-12 17:00:00  5.366\n        2016-12-12 18:00:00  5.784\n        2016-12-12 19:00:00  5.384\n        2016-12-12 20:00:00  4.620\n        2016-12-12 21:00:00  5.082\n        2016-12-12 22:00:00  6.929\n        2016-12-12 23:00:00  7.898\n\n        Then 2016-12-13 00:00:00: 6.414 (same as 2016-12-12 00:00:00)\n\n   And so on for 4 days.\n\n   We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n   We must output in the exact format as the input, with the date in the same format and the value rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the input had 3 decimal places, but sometimes they were integers (like 0.000).

We are using the average to mitigate any potential anomalies.\n\n   This is a simple and robust method for very short-term forecasting with limited data.\n\n   Let's write the data.\n",
