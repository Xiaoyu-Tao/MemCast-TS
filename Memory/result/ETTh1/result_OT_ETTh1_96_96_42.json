        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided 96 points, there are no explicit missing values (no NaN in the given data). \n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values. Since we are only given a contiguous block of 96, we assume that for forecasting we can use the given data as is.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps.\n\n 3. Given the constraints of the problem and the fact that we are in a text-based environment, we cannot run complex models. \n    We'll use a simple but effective method: Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA. However, note that the data shows:\n        - A daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly a weekly pattern (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not evident).\n        - The temperature has a clear daily cycle.\n\n 4. We choose a model that can capture seasonality. Since we have hourly data and the seasonality is 24, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. Given the requirement for 96 steps, we can use the Holt-Winters method (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with a seasonality of 24.\n\n 6. However, note that the last point (2016-12-19 23:00:00) is 9.849, which is a drop. We must account for that.\n\n 7. We'll use the `statsmodels` library in our mind to simulate the model. But note: we are to output the forecast without running actual code.\n\n 8. Since we cannot run code, we must rely on a logical approach. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: \n    - The data has a pattern: daily peaks and troughs. We can take the average of the same hour over the past 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 9. However, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the given data we don't have any. So we can use the available 4 days.\n\n 10. Let's break down the data by hour:\n\n     We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n     We can group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for each hour.\n\n     But note: the last day (2016-12-19) has a drop at 23:00 to 9.849, which is lower than the previous days. \n     This might be an outlier or a missing value? But the problem says to be aware of missing values, but we are not told which are missing.\n\n     Since we are not given any indication of missingness in the provided data, we will use the data as is.\n\n 11. Method: \n      For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have 4 observations (from 4 days). We can take the average of these 4 for each hour to form the next day's pattern, and then repeat for 4 days.\n\n      However, this would be a naive seasonal average. But note: the temperature might have a trend? Looking at the data:\n\n        Day 1 (16th): min ~8.9, max ~13.8\n        Day 2 (17th): min ~8.2, max ~17.2\n        Day 3 (18th): min ~10.6, max ~16.1\n        Day 4 (19th): min ~9.8, max ~16.9\n\n      There is no clear upward or downward trend over these 4 days. So we can use the average.\n\n 12. Steps for averaging:\n\n      Let H0, H1, ... H23 be the hours.\n\n      For hour 0: \n          2016-12-16 00:00:00: 11.115\n          2016-12-17 00:00:00: 9.426\n          2016-12-18 00:00:00: 10.552\n          2016-12-19 00:00:00: 15.195\n          Average = (11.115 + 9.426 + 10.552 + 15.195) / 4 = 11.572\n\n      Similarly for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n 13. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd) for each hour will be the same: the average for that hour.\n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not been given any in the 96 points, so we assume the provided 96 are complete.\n\n 15. However, the last value on 2016-12-19 23:00:00 is 9.849, which is lower than the previous days at 23:00. \n        Day1 23:00: 9.567\n        Day2 23:00: 10.200\n        Day3 23:00: 13.999\n        Day4 23:00: 9.849\n     The average for 23: (9.567+10.200+13.999+9.849)/4 = 10.90375\n\n 16. We'll compute the average for each hour and then assign that average to the same hour for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. The dates for the next 96 hours (starting from the last point) are:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-20 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-12-20 01:00:00\n        ...\n        Until 2016-12-23 23:00:00\n\n 18. We'll generate 96 rows.\n\n 19. Format: \n        <answer>\n        date,OT\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00, [average for hour0]\n        2016-12-20 01:00:00, [average for hour1]\n        ...\n        2016-12-20 23:00:00, [average for hour23]\n        2016-12-21 00:00:00, [average for hour0]\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. We must compute the 24 averages.\n\n 21. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0: (11.115 + 9.426 + 10.552 + 15.195)/4 = (46.288)/4 = 11.572\n1: (10.693 + 9.919 + 11.889 + 14.843)/4 = (47.344)/4 = 11.836\n2: (10.482 + 9.919 + 12.240 + 14.843)/4 = (47.484)/4 = 11.871\n3: (9.989 + 9.778 + 12.240 + 14.562)/4 = (46.569)/4 = 11.64225\n4: (8.934 + 9.638 + 12.592 + 14.703)/4 = (45.867)/4 = 11.46675\n5: (8.934 + 8.231 + 12.311 + 14.069)/4 = (43.545)/4 = 10.88625\n6: (10.341 + 9.145 + 11.889 + 15.617)/4 = (46.992)/4 = 11.748\n7: (9.145 + 10.763 + 11.748 + 14.351)/4 = (46.007)/4 = 11.50175\n8: (9.638 + 10.130 + 12.240 + 15.898)/4 = (47.906)/4 = 11.9765\n9: (10.482 + 9.567 + 13.788 + 16.883)/4 = (50.72)/4 = 12.68\n10: (10.904 + 11.185 + 13.788 + 15.406)/4 = (51.283)/4 = 12.82075\n11: (12.240 + 11.889 + 12.944 + 15.054)/4 = (52.127)/4 = 13.03175\n12: (11.818 + 13.014 + 13.647 + 14.351)/4 = (52.83)/4 = 13.2075\n13: (13.155 + 16.180 + 14.914 + 14.703)/4 = (58.952)/4 = 14.738\n14: (13.788 + 17.165 + 16.109 + 14.632)/4 = (61.694)/4 = 15.4235\n15: (13.718 + 13.788 + 16.109 + 15.898)/4 = (59.513)/4 = 14.87825\n16: (13.225 + 13.085 + 14.843 + 15.054)/4 = (56.207)/4 = 14.05175\n17: (12.733 + 12.592 + 14.421 + 15.898)/4 = (55.644)/4 = 13.911\n18: (11.818 + 11.467 + 14.491 + 15.406)/4 = (53.182)/4 = 13.2955\n19: (11.818 + 11.185 + 14.351 + 15.758)/4 = (53.112)/4 = 13.278\n20: (11.115 + 10.482 + 14.140 + 15.195)/4 = (50.932)/4 = 12.733\n21: (10.341 + 10.341 + 14.562 + 14.210)/4 = (49.454)/4 = 12.3635\n22: (9.778 + 10.271 + 14.773 + 14.210)/4 = (49.032)/4 = 12.258\n23: (9.567 + 10.200 + 13.999 + 9.849)/4 = (43.615)/4 = 10.90375\n\n 22. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2016-12-20, hours 0 to 23: [11.572, 11.836, 11.871, 11.64225, 11.46675, 10.88625, 11.748, 11.50175, 11.9765, 12.68, 12.82075, 13.03175, 13.2075, 14.738, 15.4235, 14.87825, 14.05175, 13.911, 13.2955, 13.278, 12.733, 12.3635, 12.258, 10.90375]\n\n      Day 2: 2016-12-21: same 24 values\n      Day 3: 2016-12-22: same 24 values\n      Day 4: 2016-12-23: same 24 values\n\n 23. We output the data in the exact format.\n\n 24. Note: The problem says \"complete data\", so we output 96 rows.\n\n 25. We format the dates accordingly.\n\n 26. We must output the data with the same precision (3 decimal places) as the input.\n\n 27. Let's write the averages rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 28. However, note: the input has 6 decimal places? Actually, the input has 3 decimal places. So we output 3.\n\n 29. We'll round the computed averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 30. The computed averages:\n\n        hour0: 11.572 -> 11.572\n        hour1: 11.836 -> 11.836\n        hour2: 11.871 -> 11.871\n        hour3: 11.64225 -> 11.642\n        hour4: 11.46675 -> 11.467\n        hour5: 10.88625 -> 10.886\n        hour6: 11.748 -> 11.748\n        hour7: 11.50175 -> 11.502\n        hour8: 11.9765 -> 11.977\n        hour9: 12.68 -> 12.680\n        hour10: 12.82075 -> 12.821\n        hour11: 13.03175 -> 13.032\n        hour12: 13.2075 -> 13.208\n        hour13: 14.738 -> 14.738\n        hour14: 15.4235 -> 15.424\n        hour15: 14.87825 -> 14.878\n        hour16: 14.05175 -> 14.052\n        hour17: 13.911 -> 13.911\n        hour18: 13.2955 -> 13.296\n        hour19: 13.278 -> 13.278\n        hour20: 12.733 -> 12.733\n        hour21: 12.3635 -> 12.364\n        hour22: 12.258 -> 12.258\n        hour23: 10.90375 -> 10.904\n\n 31. Now, we write the data.\n\n 32. We note that the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 33. We generate:\n\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00,11.572\n        2016-12-20 01:00:00,11.836\n        ... and so on.\n\n 34. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 35. We output in the required format.\n\n 36. Since the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content\", we output all 96 rows.\n\n 37. We wrap the answer in <answer> and use triple backticks.\n\n 38. However, note: the example input has the OT as float with 6 decimal places? Actually, the example has 3 decimal places. \n     But we see that the numbers are printed with 3 decimal places. We'll output with 3 decimal places.\n\n 39. We'll write the numbers as we computed (rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n 40. Let's code the output in the required format.\n\n 41. We'll generate the next 96 dates:\n\n        from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00\n\n 42. We have the 24 values for one day, and we repeat the same 24 for each of the 4 days.\n\n 43. We write the data.\n\n 44. Note: The problem says the data might have missing values, but we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 45. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00,11.572\n        2016-12-20 01:00:00,11.836\n        2016-12-20 02:00:00,11.871\n        2016-12-20 03:00:00,11.642\n        2016-12-20 04:00:00,11.467\n        2016-12-20 05:00:00,10.886\n        2016-12-20 06:00:00,11.748\n        2016-12-20 07:00:00,11.502\n        2016-12-20 08:00:00,11.977\n        2016-12-20 09:00:00,12.680\n        2016-12-20 10:00:00,12.821\n        2016-12-20 11:00:00,13.032\n        2016-12-20 12:00:00,13.208\n        2016-12-20 13:00:00,14.738\n        2016-12-20 14:00:00,15.424\n        2016-12-20 15:00:00,14.878\n        2016-12-20 16:00:00,14.052\n        2016-12-20 17:00:00,13.911\n        2016-12-20 18:00:00,13.296\n        2016-12-20 19:00:00,13.278\n        2016-12-20 20:00:00,12.733\n        2016-12-20 21:00:00,12.364\n        2016-12-20 22:00:00,12.258\n        2016-12-20 23:00:00,10.904\n        2016-12-21 00:00:00,11.572\n        2016-12-21 01:00:00,11.836\n        ...
