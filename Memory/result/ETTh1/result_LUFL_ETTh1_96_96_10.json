        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-10 00:00:00 to 2016-08-13 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might be captured weakly).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told that the dataset may have missing values. However, for forecasting, we are to forecast the next 96 points without gaps.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (which is multiple seasonal periods: 4 days of 24 hours) and we have only 4 days of history, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the day by taking the same hour from the last available day (or average of last few days?).\n   - However, we note that the pattern might change slightly day to day.\n\n But note: the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: low during the night, then a peak in the morning and afternoon, and a higher peak in the evening (around 20:00-21:00).\n   - Also, the level of the first day (2016-08-10) is a bit different from the following days.\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, we can consider:\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But note: the last day (2016-08-13) might be a Saturday? and the next 4 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? We don't have information about the day of the week.\n\n However, looking at the dates:\n   2016-08-10: Wednesday\n   2016-08-11: Thursday\n   2016-08-12: Friday\n   2016-08-13: Saturday\n\n So the next 96 hours (4 days) would be:\n   2016-08-14: 00:00 to 23:00 (Sunday)\n   2016-08-15: 00:00 to 23:00 (Monday)\n   2016-08-16: 00:00 to 23:00 (Tuesday)\n   2016-08-17: 00:00 to 23:00 (Wednesday)\n\n We might expect that Sunday (2016-08-14) has a different pattern (weekend) compared to the weekdays we have? But we only have one Saturday (2016-08-13) and no Sunday in the history.\n\n How to handle?\n   - We can use the last day (Saturday) for the Sunday? But that might not be accurate.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) but we have only 4 days (96 points) and we want to forecast 96 points (which is the same as the seasonal period) so it might be challenging.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only to provide a forecast, we can use:\n\n   Method: Seasonal Naive with drift? or just the average of the same hour over the available days? But note the data has a trend? Let's check:\n\n   The overall level of the data:\n     2016-08-10: average around 4.0? (let me compute the daily average)\n     2016-08-10: (3.290+2.833+...+4.599)/24 = (let me not compute exactly) but the values are between 2.559 and 6.122.\n     2016-08-11: from 4.203 to 6.061 -> average might be similar?\n     2016-08-12: from 4.203 to 6.396 -> similar?\n     2016-08-13: from 5.056 to 7.188 -> seems a bit higher?\n\n   We can compute the daily average:\n\n   Day 1 (2016-08-10): \n        sum = 3.290+2.833+2.711+2.619+2.559+2.802+3.015+2.924+3.320+3.564+4.021+4.142+4.082+4.325+4.142+3.868+3.868+3.990+3.990+4.203+6.122+5.544+4.599+4.599\n        = 92.812\n        average = 92.812 / 24 = 3.867\n\n   Day 2 (2016-08-11): \n        = 6.518+6.031+5.818+5.665+5.513+5.422+5.483+3.168+3.290+3.533+3.990+4.538+4.538+5.208+4.752+4.508+4.173+4.264+4.112+4.112+6.061+5.757+5.178+4.691\n        = 110.000 (approx) -> 110.000/24 = 4.583\n\n   Day 3 (2016-08-12):\n        = 4.203+3.929+3.503+2.955+2.985+2.772+2.772+2.955+3.198+3.442+3.929+4.264+4.447+4.813+4.477+4.082+4.021+4.203+4.203+4.325+6.396+6.275+5.635+5.056\n        = 95.000 (approx) -> 95.000/24 = 3.958\n\n   Day 4 (2016-08-13):\n        = 6.579+6.366+5.879+5.787+5.635+5.361+5.665+5.574+3.259+3.686+4.234+4.873+4.752+5.269+5.178+4.691+4.447+4.417+4.599+4.965+7.188+6.945+6.000+5.604\n        = 118.000 (approx) -> 118.000/24 = 4.917\n\n   The daily averages: 3.867, 4.583, 3.958, 4.917 -> no clear trend? \n\n   But note: the last day (Saturday) has the highest average. Then the next day is Sunday, which might be similar to Saturday? or different?\n\n   Since we don't have a Sunday in the history, we can use the Saturday pattern for Sunday? and then for Monday we can use the average of the weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri) for the same hour? But note that Friday might be different from Wednesday and Thursday? \n\n   However, we have only 4 days. We can do:\n\n   For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from the 4 days). We can take the average of the same hour for the 4 days? But that would smooth out the weekend effect.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n     - For Sunday (2016-08-14): use the same hour from Saturday (2016-08-13) as the forecast for each hour.\n     - For Monday (2016-08-15): use the same hour from the previous Monday? but we don't have. So we can use the average of Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? (excluding Saturday) for that hour.\n     - For Tuesday: same as Monday? or use the average of the weekdays? but we don't have Tuesday in the history.\n\n   This becomes messy.\n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only to provide a forecast, we can use:\n\n     Option: Use the last day (Saturday) for the entire next 4 days? That would be 4 copies of the Saturday pattern? But that would ignore the weekly pattern and the fact that Monday might be different.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last 4 days? \n\n   Let me try for hour 0: \n        Day1: 3.290, Day2: 6.518, Day3: 4.203, Day4: 6.579 -> average = (3.290+6.518+4.203+6.579)/4 = 5.1475\n\n   Then for the next 4 days, we use 5.1475 for hour 0? But that would be the same for every day? and we lose the daily pattern? \n\n   We want to capture the daily pattern. So we can compute the average for each hour over the 4 days? \n\n   For hour 0: (3.290 + 6.518 + 4.203 + 6.579) / 4 = 5.1475\n   For hour 1: (2.833+6.031+3.929+6.366)/4 = 4.78975\n\n   and so on.\n\n   Then we use these 24 averages and repeat them for the next 4 days? \n\n   But note: the next 4 are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We don't have any day of the week information in the average. So the Sunday forecast would be the same as the Monday forecast? \n\n   However, we have one Saturday in the average, which might make the Sunday forecast a bit higher? \n\n   This method is simple and might be acceptable.\n\n   But let me check: the average of the entire 4 days for each hour.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? but average is fine.\n\n   Steps for forecasting:\n\n     Step 1: Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n     Step 2: For each hour, compute the average of the 4 values we have for that hour.\n     Step 3: For the next 96 hours (4 days), for each day, use the 24 average values computed.\n\n   Example for the first 24 hours (2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-14 23:00:00):\n\n        hour0: average of the 4 days at 00:00 -> 5.1475\n        hour1: average of the 4 days at 01:00 -> 4.78975\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for the next day (2016-08-15) we use the same 24 averages? \n\n   But note: the data might have a trend? The daily level has been fluctuating: 3.867, 4.583, 3.958, 4.917. We can adjust the level by a multiplicative factor? \n\n   However, we don't have a clear trend. So we can just use the average.\n\n   But note: the problem says there might be missing values? In the provided data there are none. So we can use the average.\n\n   Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (3.290, 6.518, 4.203, 6.579) -> 5.1475\n        hour1: (2.833, 6.031, 3.929, 6.366) -> 4.78975\n        hour2: (2.711, 5.818, 3.503, 5.879) -> 4.47775\n        hour3: (2.619, 5.665, 2.955, 5.787) -> 4.2565\n        hour4: (2.559, 5.513, 2.985, 5.635) -> 4.173\n        hour5: (2.802, 5.422, 2.772, 5.361) -> 4.08925\n        hour6: (3.015, 5.483, 2.772, 5.665) -> 4.23375\n        hour7: (2.924, 3.168, 2.955, 5.574) -> 3.65525\n        hour8: (3.320, 3.290, 3.198, 3.259) -> 3.26675\n        hour9: (3.564, 3.533, 3.442, 3.686) -> 3.55625\n        hour10: (4.021, 3.990, 3.929, 4.234) -> 4.0435\n        hour11: (4.142, 4.538, 4.264, 4.873) -> 4.45425\n        hour12: (4.082, 4.538, 4.447, 4.752) -> 4.45475\n        hour13: (4.325, 5.208, 4.813, 5.269) -> 4.90375\n        hour14: (4.142, 4.752, 4.477, 5.178) -> 4.63725\n        hour15: (3.868, 4.508, 4.082, 4.691) -> 4.28725\n        hour16: (3.868, 4.173, 4.021, 4.447) -> 4.12725\n        hour17: (3.990, 4.264, 4.203, 4.417) -> 4.2185\n        hour18: (3.990, 4.112, 4.203, 4.599) -> 4.226\n        hour19: (4.203, 4.112, 4.325, 4.965) -> 4.40125\n        hour20: (6.122, 6.061, 6.396, 7.188) -> 6.44175\n        hour21: (5.544, 5.757, 6.275, 6.945) -> 6.13025\n        hour22: (4.599, 5.178, 5.635, 6.000) -> 5.353\n        hour23: (4.599, 4.691, 5.056, 5.604) -> 4.9875\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day1 (2016-08-14): [5.1475, 4.78975, 4.47775, 4.2565, 4.173, 4.08925, 4.23375, 3.65525, 3.26675, 3.55625, 4.0435, 4.45425, 4.45475, 4.90375, 4.63725, 4.28725, 4.12725, 4.2185, 4.226, 4.40125, 6.44175, 6.13025, 5.353, 4.9875]\n        Day2 (2016-08-15): same 24 numbers\n        Day3 (2016-08-16): same\n        Day4 (2016-08-17): same\n\n   But note: the actual data has a pattern that the weekend day (Saturday) was higher. We are forecasting Sunday with the same pattern as the average of 4 days (which includes one Saturday and three weekdays). Then Monday we are using the same pattern? \n\n   This might be acceptable as a simple baseline.\n\n   However, we can try to adjust for the day of the week? But we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality (only one Saturday, and no Sunday).\n\n   Therefore, we go with the average by hour.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. In the provided 96 points, there are none. So we don't need to impute for the history.\n\n   We are to output the next 96 points (4 days) with the same hourly frequency.\n\n   Format: \n        date (from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00) and the forecasted LUFL.\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-08-14 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-08-14 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-17 23:00:00.\n\n   We have the 24 averages as above.

But we are forecasting without missing values? and we are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 points without missing.\n\n   We'll output the data as above.\n\n   Let me double-check the rounding for one more: h10: 4.0435 -> 4.044? \n        Yes, because 4.0435 rounded to 3 decimals: the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal: 4.044.\n\n   But note: the input had 3 decimal places and we are rounding the average to 3 decimal places.\n\n   We are ready.\n",
