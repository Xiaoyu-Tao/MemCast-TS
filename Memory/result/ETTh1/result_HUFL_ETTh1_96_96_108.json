        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-09-06 00:00:00 to 2017-09-09 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data seems complete for the 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. \n    However, in the given 96 points, there are no missing values. But for forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the input.\n\n 2. Since the problem states that the data may have missing values, but in the provided segment we don't see any, we assume that the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. We'll use a time series model. Given the hourly data and the possibility of multiple seasonality (daily, weekly), \n we can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with multiple seasonality), or Prophet.\n\n However, note that we have only 96 points (4 days) of history. This is a very short history. Therefore, we must use a model that can work with limited data.\n\n Given the short history, we can try to capture:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - But we only have 4 days, so weekly seasonality (168 hours) is not feasible.\n\n Approach:\n   We can use a model that can handle daily seasonality. Since we have 4 days, we can set the seasonal period to 24.\n\n   We can use:\n      - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) with order (p,d,q) and seasonal order (P,D,Q,24)\n      - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality of 24.\n\n   However, with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA model with 24 seasonal lags might be challenging because we have only 4 seasons.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days, but that would not capture trends.\n\n   Given the complexity and the short data, we can try a) a naive model (last day repeated) or b) a model that uses the average of the same hour in the past 4 days.\n\n   But note: the data shows a pattern that is not exactly repeating. Also, there is a few negative values which might indicate some anomaly.\n\n   Another idea: use a model that can capture the daily pattern and a trend. We can use a linear regression with dummy variables for each hour? \n   But with 4 days, we have 4 points per hour, which is very few.\n\n   Considering the constraints, we can use a simple method: \n        - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual, then forecast each component.\n\n   However, with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to estimate.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (the 4th day) and adjust it by the average change from day to day? \n\n   Given the challenge, we can use a moving average method with seasonality.\n\n   Proposed method:\n        For each hour in the next day (0 to 23), we compute:\n          forecast = last_observed_hour_value + average_daily_change_for_that_hour\n\n        But what is the average_daily_change_for_that_hour?\n          We can compute the difference between the same hour of consecutive days and average that.\n\n        However, we have only 3 differences (from day1 to day2, day2 to day3, day3 to day4) for each hour.\n\n        Let:\n          day0: 2017-09-06\n          day1: 2017-09-07\n          day2: 2017-09-08\n          day3: 2017-09-09\n\n        For hour h, we have:\n          diff1 = day1[h] - day0[h]\n          diff2 = day2[h] - day1[h]\n          diff3 = day3[h] - day2[h]\n\n        Then average_diff = (diff1 + diff2 + diff3) / 3\n\n        Then the forecast for day4 (2017-09-10) at hour h: day3[h] + average_diff\n\n        Then for day5 (2017-09-11): day4_forecast[h] + average_diff\n        and so on.\n\n   But note: the average_diff might be very small and the pattern might not be linear. Also, we are projecting the same average_diff for 4 days? \n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by a linear trend? \n\n   However, the data shows some non-linear behavior. \n\n   Given the short history, we are forced to use a simple model.\n\n   We'll use a model that:\n        - For each hour of the day, we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and then add a linear trend component.\n\n   Steps for the next 96 hours (4 days) we have 4 points for each hour (from 0 to 23). We can do:\n\n        Let Y_{d,h} be the value at day d and hour h.\n\n        We model: Y_{d,h} = base_h + trend * d\n\n        For each hour h (0 to 23), we have 4 points (d=0,1,2,3). We can fit a linear regression for each hour: \n            Y_h = a_h + b_h * d\n\n        Then for the next days (d=4,5,6,7) we forecast: \n            Y_{4,h} = a_h + b_h * 4\n            Y_{5,h} = a_h + b_h * 5\n            ... \n\n   But note: we have only 4 points per hour, so the linear regression might be unstable. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\n   We can compute the overall trend by the average of the entire series? \n\n   However, the problem is that the series is short and we are forecasting 4 days ahead.\n\n   Given the complexity and the requirement to provide an answer, we choose a simple method:\n\n        We use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days as the base, and then we add the average of the last day's value minus the average of the previous day's same hour? \n\n   But let's look at the data: \n\n        The last day (2017-09-09) has a pattern that might be the most recent. We can use the last day as a base and then adjust by the average change from the same day of the previous week? \n\n   However, we don't have a week of data.\n\n   Considering the above, we decide to use a naive seasonal method: \n        forecast for day4 (2017-09-10) = the value of day0 (2017-09-06) for the same hour? \n        or \n        = the value of day3 (2017-09-09) for the same hour? \n\n   But that would be just repeating the last day. \n\n   We can try to repeat the last day (day3) for the next 4 days? \n\n   However, the problem says to forecast 96 hours (4 days). We can repeat the last day 4 times? \n\n   But the data shows that the pattern is changing from day to day. \n\n   Another idea: use the average of the 4 days for each hour. \n\n        For hour h, let:\n            base_h = (Y0_h + Y1_h + Y2_h + Y3_h) / 4\n\n        Then the forecast for each of the next 4 days at hour h is base_h.\n\n   This is a constant forecast per hour for the next 4 days.\n\n   However, we see that the data has a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n\n        Day0 (2017-09-06): \n            average = (12.123+11.454+9.511+10.851+11.052+11.721+12.056+11.320+8.105+1.741+3.818+4.153+4.421+5.626+4.287+4.823+5.023+6.698+6.631+7.167+7.100+8.908+8.841+10.650) / 24\n            = 7.78 (approx)\n\n        Day1 (2017-09-07): \n            average = (11.855+9.444+10.784+11.052+11.119+10.583+10.315+9.779+6.899+7.100+2.813-3.081-3.081-9.377-1.608-0.737-4.957+2.545+6.631+7.703+7.904+7.100+6.698+9.578) / 24\n            = 5.24 (approx)\n\n        Day2 (2017-09-08): \n            average = (10.382+10.181+7.100+8.306+7.971+8.975+10.918+7.703+6.631+0.603-4.354-8.172-7.167-8.172-8.172-8.105-0.804+3.416+6.966+8.105+8.439+9.511+10.717+10.449) /24\n            = 4.20 (approx)\n\n        Day3 (2017-09-09): \n            average = (13.262+10.114+10.918+11.788+12.056+11.788+12.592+9.377+2.545-0.737-6.095-3.349-5.693-12.324-9.176-4.220-2.277+4.756+7.100+7.904+8.439+7.569+8.640+9.846) /24\n            = 4.50 (approx)\n\n   The daily averages are: 7.78, 5.24, 4.20, 4.50 -> not a clear trend.\n\n   Given the above, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days for the next 4 days.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23):\n            base_h = (value at day0 hour h + day1 hour h + day2 hour h + day3 hour h) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (2017-09-10 to 2017-09-13), each day at hour h we set the value to base_h.\n\n   But note: the data has some negative values and the pattern is not stable. This method will smooth out the daily pattern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? \n\n   However, the problem does not to omit any content and to provide the complete data.\n\n   We'll go with the average per hour.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n        Hour 0: (12.123 + 11.855 + 10.382 + 13.262) / 4 = 11.9055\n        Hour 1: (11.454 + 9.444 + 10.181 + 10.114) / 4 = 10.29825\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for the next day (2017-09-10) we assign:\n        00:00:00 -> 11.9055\n        01:00:00 -> 10.29825\n        ... \n\n   and the same for the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the next 4 days are 96 hours.
