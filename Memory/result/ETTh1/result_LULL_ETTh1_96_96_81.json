        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-21 00:00:00 to 2017-05-24 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided 96 points are consecutive without missing values in the given sample.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the nature of the data (electricity load), we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly patterns, but we only have 4 days of data so weekly patterns are hard to capture.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given 4 days of data, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality. A good choice is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, which can handle seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data might have non-constant variance or non-stationarity. We should check for stationarity and apply differencing if needed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality, or even a seasonal naive method.\n\n But given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days (96 hours) ahead, we must be cautious.\n\n Let's analyze the data:\n   - The data shows a clear daily pattern: higher during the day and lower at night? But looking at the provided data, the pattern is not very consistent. For example, on 2017-05-22, there is a drop to 0.152 at 18:00 which is unusual.\n\n However, we are to forecast the next 96 hours. We'll use a model that can handle the seasonality of 24 periods (since hourly data and daily seasonality).\n\n Given the constraints, we choose a simple model: Seasonal Naive. Why?\n   - With only 4 days, complex models might overfit. The seasonal naive method uses the last complete season (i.e., the previous day) as the forecast.\n\n But note: the data on 2017-05-22 has an unusual drop at 18:00 (0.152) and then recovers. The next days (23rd and 24th) do not show such a drop. So we might not want to use the 22nd as the template for the 25th? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last few days for each hour.\n\n Steps for Seasonal Naive with averaging:\n   - We have 4 days: 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th of May 2017.\n   - We can take the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (22nd, 23rd, 24th) to forecast the 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th? But note: we are forecasting 4 days, so we have 4 days of data to forecast 4 days.\n\n However, we can do:\n   - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the available days (we have 4 days). Then we use that average for the same hour in the next 4 days? But that would be the same pattern repeated.\n\n But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have enough to capture weekly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (24th) as the forecast for the 25th, then use the 25th (which we just forecasted) to forecast the 26th? That would be a recursive seasonal naive? But that might propagate errors.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (excluding the first day? or including all?) to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Why 3 days? Because the 22nd has an anomaly? But we don't know if that anomaly is a regular event. Since we are not given context, we use all 4 days.\n\n So, for each hour (0 to 23) we compute the average of the 4 days we have. Then we use that average for each of the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n Example:\n   For hour 0: \n        values: 1.432 (21st), 1.127 (22nd), 1.614 (23rd), 0.975 (24th) -> average = (1.432+1.127+1.614+0.975)/4 = 1.287\n   Then for 2017-05-25 00:00:00 -> 1.287\n        for 2017-05-26 00:00:00 -> 1.287\n        for 2017-05-27 00:00:00 -> 1.287\n        for 2017-05-28 00:00:00 -> 1.287\n\n But note: the data has a clear downward trend? Let's see the hour 0: \n        21st: 1.432, 22nd: 1.127, 23rd: 1.614, 24th: 0.975 -> no clear trend.\n\n However, this method will produce the same pattern for each day. But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day. But with only 4 days, we don't have a better option.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 3 days for each hour to forecast the next day, then for the next day we use the same pattern? But that would be the same as above.\n\n We decide to use the average of the 4 days for each hour to form a daily profile, and then repeat that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n   - Then for the next 4 days (from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n This method is simple and handles seasonality.\n\n However, note: the data on 2017-05-22 18:00:00 is 0.152, which is very low. This might be an outlier? But without more context, we include it.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n  0: (1.432 + 1.127 + 1.614 + 0.975) / 4 = 1.287\n  1: (1.432 + 0.944 + 1.645 + 0.822) / 4 = 1.21025\n  2: (1.492 + 1.036 + 1.614 + 0.853) / 4 = 1.24875\n  3: (1.553 + 1.036 + 1.584 + 0.944) / 4 = 1.27925\n  4: (1.462 + 1.218 + 1.036 + 0.975) / 4 = 1.17275\n  5: (1.584 + 1.310 + 1.614 + 0.822) / 4 = 1.3325\n  6: (1.279 + 1.401 + 1.523 + 0.731) / 4 = 1.2335\n  7: (1.310 + 1.462 + 1.218 + 0.822) / 4 = 1.203\n  8: (1.310 + 1.371 + 1.005 + 0.822) / 4 = 1.127\n  9: (1.523 + 1.432 + 1.036 + 1.005) / 4 = 1.249\n 10: (1.553 + 1.432 + 1.036 + 0.975) / 4 = 1.249\n 11: (1.401 + 1.157 + 0.883 + 0.883) / 4 = 1.081\n 12: (1.310 + 1.310 + 0.914 + 1.097) / 4 = 1.15775\n 13: (1.340 + 1.218 + 0.883 + 0.975) / 4 = 1.104\n 14: (1.371 + 1.066 + 0.853 + 0.822) / 4 = 1.028\n 15: (1.279 + 1.249 + 0.670 + 0.731) / 4 = 0.98225\n 16: (1.188 + 1.249 + 0.761 + 1.005) / 4 = 1.05075\n 17: (1.188 + 1.310 + 0.853 + 1.218) / 4 = 1.14225\n 18: (1.066 + 0.152 + 0.822 + 1.157) / 4 = 0.79925\n 19: (0.944 + 0.183 + 0.883 + 1.097) / 4 = 0.77675\n 20: (0.975 + 0.487 + 1.097 + 0.914) / 4 = 0.86825\n 21: (0.944 + 1.005 + 0.914 + 1.127) / 4 = 0.9975\n 22: (1.249 + 1.005 + 1.279 + 0.944) / 4 = 1.11925\n 23: (1.097 + 1.097 + 1.005 + 0.975) / 4 = 1.0435\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2017-05-25 to 2017-05-28), we assign:\n   2017-05-25 00:00:00 -> 1.287\n   2017-05-25 01:00:00 -> 1.21025\n   ... and so on for 24 hours, then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n But note: the data provided ends at 2017-05-24 23:00:00, so the next day is 2017-05-25.\n\n We generate 96 hours: 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n We'll create the timestamps and the corresponding LULL value.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. We are to forecast the next 96 without missing? So we output 96 consecutive points.\n\n Let's code the timestamps:\n\n   Start: 2017-05-25 00:00:00\n   Then 2017-05-25 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-28 23:00:00.\n\n We have 4 days: 25, 26, 27, 28.\n\n We'll use the same 24 averages for each of these days.\n\n We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input has 3 decimal places, so we'll keep that.\n\n However, the average for hour 18 is 0.79925 -> 0.799, and hour 19 is 0.77675 -> 0.777, etc.\n\n We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's recalculate the averages and round:\n\n  0: 1.287 -> 1.287\n  1: 1.21025 -> 1.210\n  2: 1.24875 -> 1.249\n  3: 1.27925 -> 1.279\n  4: 1.17275 -> 1.173\n  5: 1.3325 -> 1.333\n  6: 1.2335 -> 1.234\n  7: 1.203 -> 1.203\n  8: 1.127 -> 1.127\n  9: 1.249 -> 1.249\n 10: 1.249 -> 1.249\n 11: 1.081 -> 1.081\n 12: 1.15775 -> 1.158\n 13: 1.104 -> 1.104\n 14: 1.028 -> 1.028\n 15: 0.98225 -> 0.982\n 16: 1.05075 -> 1.051\n 17: 1.14225 -> 1.142\n 18: 0.79925 -> 0.799\n 19: 0.77675 -> 0.777\n 20: 0.86825 -> 0.868\n 21: 0.9975 -> 0.998\n 22: 1.11925 -> 1.119\n 23: 1.0435 -> 1.044\n\n Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n  2017-05-25 00:00:00 1.287\n  2017-05-25 01:00:00 1.210\n  2017-05-25 02:00:00 1.249\n  2017-05-25 03:00:00 1.279\n  2017-05-25 04:00:00 1.173\n  2017-05-25 05:00:00 1.333\n  2017-05-25 06:00:00 1.234\n  2017-05-25 07:00:00 1.203\n  2017-05-25 08:00:00 1.127\n  2017-05-25 09:00:00 1.249\n  2017-05-25 10:00:00 1.249\n  2017-05-25 11:00:00 1.081\n  2017-05-25 12:00:00 1.158\n  2017-05-25 13:00:00 1.104\n  2017-05-25 14:00:00 1.028\n  2017-05-25 15:00:00 0.982\n  2017-05-25 16:00:00 1.051\n  2017-05-25 17:00:00 1.142\n  2017-05-25 18:00:00 0.799\n  2017-05-25 19:00:00 0.777\n  2017-05-25 20:00:00 0.868\n  2017-05-25 21:00:00 0.998\n  2017-05-25 22:00:00 1.119\n  2017-05-25 23:00:00 1.044\n\n Then repeat the same 24 values for the next day (26th), then 27th, then 28th.\n\n We output 96 lines.\n\n But note: the problem says \"complete data\", meaning we must output the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted LULL.\n\n We write the answer in the required format.\n\n However, note: the input data has the date as index?
