        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-02-06 00:00:00 to 2017-02-09 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says the data will have missing values. \n    However, the provided sample for the past 96 does not show any missing value. So we assume the past 96 is complete. But we must be cautious for the forecast.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we need to generate the timestamps and the forecasted HUFL values.\n\n 4. The last timestamp in the given data is 2017-02-09 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n 5. We must choose a forecasting method. Given the data, we can use a time series model. Since the data shows hourly patterns and we have 4 days (96 hours) of data, \n    we can consider a model that captures daily seasonality (seasonality of 24 hours).\n\n 6. However, note that the data is only 4 days, which is very short for training a complex model. We might use a simple model like Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality) or SARIMA.\n\n 7. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't see any, but we are to forecast the next 96 which might have missing? \n    Actually, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" - meaning the provided past data might have missing? But in the given 96, there are no missing. \n    So we assume the provided 96 is complete. For the forecast, we are to generate 96 consecutive points without missing? The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must output 96 points.\n\n 8. We are to use a model that can handle the seasonality. Let's use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use SARIMA.\n\n 9. Given the small data size, we can try to fit a SARIMA model. We note that the data has:\n    - A daily pattern (24 hours cycle). So seasonal period is 24.\n    - The data might have a trend? Let's look: \n        The values in the first day (2017-02-06) range from about -3 to 13, \n        the next days are similar. But we see a slight increase? Not very clear.\n\n 10. We'll use an automated approach to select the best SARIMA parameters using AIC, but note that with only 96 points and a seasonal period of 24, \n     the number of parameters should be kept low to avoid overfitting.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simpler model: \n      - We can use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days. So for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 observations. \n        We can take the average for each hour and then use that as the next 4 days? But that would be exactly the same pattern repeated. \n\n 12. However, we note that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. We might need to account for a trend and also for some randomness.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to generate 96 points, we can use a model that automatically captures seasonality: \n     Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (with additive seasonality and trend). But note: the data might have multiplicative seasonality? \n     Looking at the data, the amplitude of the seasonality does not seem to change dramatically over the 4 days, so additive might be okay.\n\n 14. Steps for Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing) for 24-hour seasonality:\n\n     We have:\n        level, trend, seasonal (with period 24)\n\n     We can use the next 96 points by extending the seasonal pattern and the trend.\n\n 15. However, with only 4 days (96 points) and a seasonality of 24, we have exactly 4 seasons. This is the minimum for the model to work.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be only 24 hours, and we need 96.\n\n 17. We are going to use the Holt-Winters method with additive seasonality. We'll use the `ExponentialSmoothing` from statsmodels.\n\n 18. But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not given any in the past 96, so we can proceed. For the forecast, we are to generate without missing.\n\n 19. Implementation:\n\n     We have a time series `y` with 96 points.\n\n     We set:\n        seasonal_periods = 24\n        model = ExponentialSmoothing(y, seasonal='add', seasonal_periods=24, trend='add', initialization_method='estimated')\n        fit = model.fit()\n        forecast = fit.forecast(96)\n\n 20. However, with only 4 seasons, the model might not be very stable. We can try without trend? Or use a damped trend? \n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving window of the last 4 days to compute the next day. For example, for the first 24 hours of the forecast (day5), we can use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days. Then for day6, we use the same? But that would be the same pattern. \n\n 22. We decide to use the Holt-Winters method and hope that the model can capture the pattern.\n\n 23. But note: the data has a value of 0.000 on 2017-02-06 15:00:00 and negative values? That might be acceptable.\n\n 24. We'll generate the model and the forecast.\n\n 25. However, since we are in a text-based environment and cannot run code, we must simulate the process. We will have to provide the forecasted values.\n\n 26. But the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 27. Since we cannot run the model here, we have to rely on a precomputed forecast or a simple method. \n\n 28. Given the constraints, we will use a simple average by hour. We take the average of each hour over the 4 available days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n     Steps:\n        For hour 0: (2017-02-06 00:00:00, 2017-02-07 00:00:00, 2017-02-08 00:00:00, 2017-02-09 00:00:00) -> average\n        Similarly for hour 1, ... 23.\n\n     Then the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n        Day1 (2017-02-10): hour0 to hour23: the average for each hour\n        Day2 (2017-02-11): same as above\n        Day3 (2017-02-12): same\n        Day4 (2017-02-13): same\n\n     But note: this method ignores any trend and any day-to-day variation. However, it is simple and we have no way to run a model.\n\n 29. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-02-09) as the forecast for the next day, then the day after that?\n\n     But that would be:\n        Day1: 2017-02-09 pattern\n        Day2: 2017-02-09 pattern again? \n\n     That might be better than the average? Because the last day might be the most recent pattern.\n\n 30. We decide to use the average method because it smooths out the randomness.\n\n 31. How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (8.707 + 11.387 + 9.176 + 10.784) / 4 = (8.707+11.387=20.094; 20.094+9.176=29.27; 29.27+10.784=40.054) -> 40.054/4 = 10.0135\n        hour1: (7.837 + 9.980 + 7.770 + 9.645) / 4 = (7.837+9.980=17.817; 17.817+7.770=25.587; 25.587+9.645=35.232) -> 35.232/4 = 8.808\n\n     and so on.\n\n 32. But note: the data has 4 days, so we have 4 values for each hour.\n\n 33. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern 4 days.\n\n 34. However, the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the provided 96 we don't have any. So we can compute the average.\n\n 35. We must generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-10 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-02-10 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n 36. We'll calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) and then assign:\n\n        Day 5 (2017-02-10): hour0 = avg0, hour1 = avg1, ... hour23 = avg23\n        Day 6 (2017-02-11): hour0 = avg0, ... \n        Day 7 (2017-02-12): same\n        Day 8 (2017-02-13): same\n\n 37. We must round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 38. Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [8.707, 11.387, 9.176, 10.784] -> (8.707+11.387+9.176+10.784)/4 = 40.054/4 = 10.0135 -> 10.014\n        hour1: [7.837, 9.980, 7.770, 9.645] -> (7.837+9.980+7.770+9.645) = 35.232 -> 8.808\n        hour2: [7.301, 9.444, 7.167, 8.707] -> (7.301+9.444+7.167+8.707) = 32.619 -> 8.155\n        hour3: [6.832, 8.975, 6.765, 8.172] -> (6.832+8.975+6.765+8.172) = 30.744 -> 7.686\n        hour4: [6.966, 8.841, 6.631, 8.038] -> (6.966+8.841+6.631+8.038) = 30.476 -> 7.619\n        hour5: [6.899, 9.109, 6.765, 7.569] -> (6.899+9.109+6.765+7.569) = 30.342 -> 7.586\n        hour6: [7.502, 7.100, 7.234, 8.506] -> (7.502+7.100+7.234+8.506) = 30.342 -> 7.586\n        hour7: [9.243, 9.645, 9.243, 9.846] -> (9.243+9.645+9.243+9.846) = 37.977 -> 9.494\n        hour8: [10.583, 8.573, 11.387, 10.650] -> (10.583+8.573+11.387+10.650) = 41.193 -> 10.298\n        hour9: [8.239, 2.009, 10.516, 5.358] -> (8.239+2.009+10.516+5.358) = 26.122 -> 6.531\n        hour10: [4.421, 6.497, 9.980, -0.737] -> (4.421+6.497+9.980-0.737) = 20.161 -> 5.040\n        hour11: [-3.282, 7.435, 10.650, -3.952] -> (-3.282+7.435+10.650-3.952) = 10.851 -> 2.713\n        hour12: [-1.942, 3.952, 8.908, -3.684] -> (-1.942+3.952+8.908-3.684) = 7.234 -> 1.809\n        hour13: [-1.139, 5.626, 8.975, -4.488] -> (-1.139+5.626+8.975-4.488) = 8.974 -> 2.244\n        hour14: [-3.148, 7.167, 10.047, -3.014] -> (-3.148+7.167+10.047-3.014) = 11.052 -> 2.763\n        hour15: [0.000, 8.975, 10.114, 0.000] -> (0.000+8.975+10.114+0.000) = 19.089 -> 4.772\n        hour16: [3.684, 10.449, 12.927, 5.760] -> (3.684+10.449+12.927+5.760) = 32.82 -> 8.205\n        hour17: [9.444, 11.454, 13.798, 10.047] -> (9.444+11.454+13.798+10.047) = 44.743 -> 11.186\n        hour18: [10.449, 11.721, 14.066, 11.655] -> (10.449+11.721+14.066+11.655) = 47.891 -> 11.973\n        hour19: [12.927, 13.932, 15.472, 14.334] -> (12.927+13.932+15.472+14.334) = 56.665 -> 14.166\n        hour20: [13.530, 14.468, 15.807, 14.803] -> (13.530+14.468+15.807+14.803) = 58.608 -> 14.652\n        hour21: [13.128, 13.597, 15.070, 14.200] -> (13.128+13.597+15.070+14.200) = 55.995 -> 13.999\n        hour22: [11.588, 12.056, 13.329, 12.592] -> (11.588+12.056+13.329+12.592) = 49.565 -> 12.391\n        hour23: [9.980, 10.181, 11.855, 10.784] -> (9.980+10.181+11.855+10.784) = 42.8 -> 10.700\n\n 39. Now, we'll create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day 5: 2017-02-10 00:00:00 -> 10.014\n               2017-02-10 01:00:00 -> 8.808\n               ... until 2017-02-10 23:00:00 -> 10.700\n\n        Day 6: 2017-02-11 00:00:00 -> 10.014\n               2017-02-11 01:00:00 -> 8.808\n               ... \n\n        Day 7: same as day5 and day6\n\n        Day 8: same\n\n 40. We must output the data in the same format: two columns: date and HUFL, with the date in the same string format.\n\n 41. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-10 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n 42. We'll write the data in the required format.\n\n 43. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating without missing.\n\n 44. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 45. We must round the HUFL to 3 decimal places.\n\n 46. Let's write the data:\n\n        date: from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00\n        HUFL: the corresponding average for the hour (0-23) as computed above, repeated for 4 days.\n\n 47. We note: the average method is very simple and might not capture the dynamics, but without running a model, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 48. We output as per the required format.\n\n 49. We'll write the answer in the <answer> tag as a markdown code block.\n\n 50. We must not omit any of the 96 points.\n\n Let's generate the data:\n\n   Hourly averages (0 to 23) we computed:\n\n        hour0: 10.014\n        hour1: 8.808\n        hour2: 8.155\n        hour3: 7.686\n        hour4: 7.619\n        hour5: 7.586\n        hour6: 7.586\n        hour7: 9.494\n        hour8: 10.298\n        hour9: 6.531\n        hour10: 5.040\n        hour11: 2.713\n        hour12: 1.809\n        hour13: 2.244\n        hour14: 2.763\n        hour15: 4.772\n        hour16: 8.205\n        hour17: 11.186\n        hour18: 11.973\n        hour19: 14.166\n        hour20: 14.652\n        hour21: 13.999\n        hour22: 12.391\n        hour23: 10.700\n\n  Then for each day in the forecast period, we assign these 24 values in order.\n\n  The forecast period: 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n  We generate the dates: \n      start: 2017-02-10 00:00:00\n      then 2017-02-10 01:00:00, ... 2017-02-10 23:00:00\n      then 2017-02-11 00:00:00 ... until 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n  We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n  Note: We rounded the averages to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n  However, note that the input we have negative values and zeros, so we must keep the sign.\n\n  We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        ```\n2017-02-10 00:00:00 10.014\n2017-02-10 01:00:00 8.808\n2017-02-10 02:00:00 8.155\n2017-02-10 03:00:00 7.686\n2017-02-10 04:00:00 7.619\n2017-02-10 05:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-10 06:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-10 07:00:00 9.494\n2017-02-10 08:00:00 10.298\n2017-02-10 09:00:00 6.531\n2017-02-10 10:00:00 5.040\n2017-02-10 11:00:00 2.713\n2017-02-10 12:00:00 1.809\n2017-02-10 13:00:00 2.244\n2017-02-10 14:00:00 2.763\n2017-02-10 15:00:00 4.772\n2017-02-10 16:00:00 8.205\n2017-02-10 17:00:00 11.186\n2017-02-10 18:00:00 11.973\n2017-02-10 19:00:00 14.166\n2017-02-10 20:00:00 14.652\n2017-02-10 21:00:00 13.999\n2017-02-10 22:00:00 12.391\n2017-02-10 23:00:00 10.700\n2017-02-11 00:00:00 10.014\n2017-02-11 01:00:00 8.808\n2017-02-11 02:00:00 8.155\n2017-02-11 03:00:00 7.686\n2017-02-11 04:00:00 7.619\n2017-02-11 05:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-11 06:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-11 07:00:00 9.494\n2017-02-11 08:00:00 10.298\n2017-02-11 09:00:00 6.531\n2017-02-11 10:00:00 5.040\n2017-02-11 11:00:00 2.713\n2017-02-11 12:00:00 1.809\n2017-02-11 13:00:00 2.244\n2017-02-11 14:00:00 2.763\n2017-02-11 15:00:00 4.772\n2017-02-11 16:00:00 8.205\n2017-02-11 17:00:00 11.186\n2017-02-11 18:00:00 11.973\n2017-02-11 19:00:00 14.166\n2017-02-11 20:00:00 14.652\n2017-02-11 21:00:00 13.999\n2017-02-11 22:00:00 12.391\n2017-02-11 23:00:00 10.700\n2017-02-12 00:00:00 10.014\n2017-02-12 01:00:00 8.808\n2017-02-12 02:00:00 8.155\n2017-02-12 03:00:00 7.686\n2017-02-12 04:00:00 7.619\n2017-02-12 05:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-12 06:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-12 07:00:00 9.494\n2017-02-12 08:00:00 10.298\n2017-02-12 09:00:00 6.531\n2017-02-12 10:00:00 5.040\n2017-02-12 11:00:00 2.713\n2017-02-12 12:00:00 1.809\n2017-02-12 13:00:00 2.244\n2017-02-12 14:00:00 2.763\n2017-02-12 15:00:00 4.772\n2017-02-12 16:00:00 8.205\n2017-02-12 17:00:00 11.186\n2017-02-12 18:00:00 11.973\n2017-02-12 19:00:00 14.166\n2017-02-12 20:00:00 14.652\n2017-02-12 21:00:00 13.999\n2017-02-12 22:00:00 12.391\n2017-02-12 23:00:00 10.700\n2017-02-13 00:00:00 10.014\n2017-02-13 01:00:00 8.808\n2017-02-13 02:00:00 8.155\n2017-02-13 03:00:00 7.686\n2017-02-13 04:00:00 7.619\n2017-02-13 05:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-13 06:00:00 7.586\n2017-02-13 07:00:00 9.494\n2017-02-13 08:00:00 10.298\n2017-02-13 09:00:00 6.531\n2017-02-13 10:00:00 5.040\n2017-02-13 11:00:00 2.713\n2017-02-13 12:00:00 1.809\n2017-02-13 13:00:00 2.244\n2017-02-13 14:00:00 2.763\n2017-02-13 15:00:00 4.772\n2017-02-13 16:00:00 8.205\n2017-02-13 17:00:00 11.186\n2017-02-13 18:00:00 11.973\n2017-02-13 19:00:00 14.166\n2017-02-13 20:00:00 14.652\n2017-02-13 21:00:00 13.999\n2017-02-13 22:00:00 12.391\n2017-02-13 23:00:00 10.700\n        ```\n\n 51.
