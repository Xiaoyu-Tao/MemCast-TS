        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-14 00:00:00 to 2016-08-17 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 4. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we are to be cautious.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data shows hourly patterns (likely daily seasonality of 24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note: the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short time series for training a model with daily seasonality (24 periods). \n But we must do our best.\n\n We can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the day by the same hour of the previous day. But we have only 4 days, so we can take the last day (day 4) and use it as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n     But note: the next 4 days would be 4*24=96 hours.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonal components. But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be estimated robustly.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n   We use the last day (2016-08-17) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the given data there are none.\n\n However, let's look at the data:\n\n   The data from 2016-08-14 to 2016-08-17 (4 days) shows a pattern? Let's check:\n\n   Day 1 (08-14): \n        00:00: 5.827, 01:00:5.961, ... 23:00:4.622\n   Day 2 (08-15): \n        00:00:6.162, ... 23:00:5.827\n   Day 3 (08-16): \n        00:00:5.157, ... 23:00:5.425\n   Day 4 (08-17): \n        00:00:5.827, ... 23:00:5.961\n\n We can see that the values at the same hour of the day are not exactly the same, but we can compute the average pattern? \n\n However, note: the problem says \"High UseLess Load\", and we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). \n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can try to capture the daily pattern by averaging the same hour across the 4 days? But 4 points per hour is very few.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the daily pattern.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's see:\n\n   The overall level doesn't seem to have a clear trend. \n\n   We can try to decompose the series into trend, seasonal and residual. However, with only 4 days, the trend might be flat.\n\n Approach 1: Seasonal Naive with the last day (2016-08-17) repeated 4 times? \n   But the next 4 days might be similar to the last day? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify any external factors (like day of week). The given data are from Thursday (2016-08-14) to Sunday (2016-08-17). \n   The next 4 days would be Monday (2016-08-18) to Thursday (2016-08-21). \n\n   Since we don't have information about weekly seasonality (only 4 days, which span Thursday to Sunday) and we are forecasting Monday to Thursday, \n   it might be better to use the average of the same hour of the previous days? \n\n   But note: the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) might be different from weekdays? We don't have a Monday in the training data.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I will use the average of the four days for each hour to form a daily profile, and then repeat that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for averaging:\n\n   For hour 0 (00:00): average of [5.827 (day1), 6.162 (day2), 5.157 (day3), 5.827 (day4)] = (5.827+6.162+5.157+5.827)/4 = 5.74325\n   Similarly for each hour.\n\n However, note: the data might have a slight trend? We don't have enough data to model trend and seasonality separately.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-08-17) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous day? But again, we have only 4 days.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have very limited data, I will use the average of the four days for each hour to form a daily profile and then repeat that for 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says \"must provide the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we have to generate 96 data points.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n   Hour 0: (5.827 + 6.162 + 5.157 + 5.827) / 4 = 5.74325\n   Hour 1: (5.961 + 5.894 + 5.425 + 5.358) / 4 = 5.6595\n   ... and so on.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2016-08-18 to 2016-08-21), we assign:\n   Day 1 (2016-08-18): [avg_hour0, avg_hour1, ..., avg_hour23]\n   Day 2 (2016-08-19): same as above\n   Day 3 (2016-08-20): same as above\n   Day 4 (2016-08-21): same as above\n\n However, note: the data provided ends at 2016-08-17 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours start at 2016-08-18 00:00:00 and end at 2016-08-21 23:00:00.\n\n But wait: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n Since we are forecasting, we are generating the next 96 without missing values.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the data had missing values, we would have imputed them. But the given data is complete.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n   Hour 0: [5.827, 6.162, 5.157, 5.827] -> 5.74325\n   Hour 1: [5.961, 5.894, 5.425, 5.358] -> 5.6595\n   Hour 2: [5.827, 6.966, 6.698, 4.689] -> (5.827+6.966+6.698+4.689)/4 = 6.045\n   Hour 3: [7.435, 7.100, 4.756, 6.296] -> (7.435+7.100+4.756+6.296)/4 = 6.39675\n   Hour 4: [6.363, 6.296, 5.157, 5.961] -> (6.363+6.296+5.157+5.961)/4 = 5.94425\n   Hour 5: [5.559, 6.966, 5.626, 4.555] -> (5.559+6.966+5.626+4.555)/4 = 5.6765\n   Hour 6: [6.162, 7.167, 5.492, 5.157] -> (6.162+7.167+5.492+5.157)/4 = 5.9945\n   Hour 7: [7.100, 7.770, 4.957, 4.689] -> (7.100+7.770+4.957+4.689)/4 = 6.129\n   Hour 8: [6.497, 6.564, 4.354, 5.827] -> (6.497+6.564+4.354+5.827)/4 = 5.8105\n   Hour 9: [6.229, 6.698, 4.890, 5.961] -> (6.229+6.698+4.890+5.961)/4 = 5.9445\n   Hour 10: [4.488, 6.765, 4.823, 6.564] -> (4.488+6.765+4.823+6.564)/4 = 5.660\n   Hour 11: [4.153, 6.564, 5.626, 6.430] -> (4.153+6.564+5.626+6.430)/4 = 5.69325\n   Hour 12: [4.019, 5.626, 5.358, 5.961] -> (4.019+5.626+5.358+5.961)/4 = 5.241\n   Hour 13: [4.153, 4.488, 5.224, 5.894] -> (4.153+4.488+5.224+5.894)/4 = 4.93975\n   Hour 14: [4.555, 4.019, 4.890, 6.698] -> (4.555+4.019+4.890+6.698)/4 = 5.0405\n   Hour 15: [4.488, 4.086, 5.157, 6.229] -> (4.488+4.086+5.157+6.229)/4 = 4.99\n   Hour 16: [5.358, 4.488, 4.287, 5.492] -> (5.358+4.488+4.287+5.492)/4 = 4.90625\n   Hour 17: [5.894, 5.894, 3.818, 5.157] -> (5.894+5.894+3.818+5.157)/4 = 5.19075\n   Hour 18: [5.090, 5.425, 3.751, 5.090] -> (5.090+5.425+3.751+5.090)/4 = 4.839\n   Hour 19: [5.492, 5.626, 3.885, 4.689] -> (5.492+5.626+3.885+4.689)/4 = 4.923\n   Hour 20: [4.756, 4.488, 5.358, 5.693] -> (4.756+4.488+5.358+5.693)/4 = 5.07375\n   Hour 21: [4.086, 4.153, 4.019, 5.827] -> (4.086+4.153+4.019+5.827)/4 = 4.52125\n   Hour 22: [5.023, 6.095, 5.559, 6.631] -> (5.023+6.095+5.559+6.631)/4 = 5.827\n   Hour 23: [4.622, 5.827, 5.425, 5.961] -> (4.622+5.827+5.425+5.961)/4 = 5.45875\n\n Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n   2016-08-18 00:00:00: 5.74325\n   2016-08-18 01:00:00: 5.6595\n   ... and so on for 24 hours of 2016-08-18, then repeat the same 24 numbers for 2016-08-19, 2016-08-20, 2016-08-21.\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are generating the forecast without missing values.\n\n However, we must output the data in the same format as the input, with the date and the HULL value.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Start: 2016-08-18 00:00:00\n   Then increment by 1 hour until 2016-08-21 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n\n But note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places for consistency.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the exact average and then round to 3 decimals.\n\n However, the input data has values like 5.827, 5.961, etc. So we output with 3 decimals.\n\n Let me compute the averages and round to 3 decimals:\n\n   Hour 0: 5.74325 -> 5.743\n   Hour 1: 5.6595 -> 5.660 (if we round half up: 5.6595 is exactly halfway?

But we are generating a complete forecast. \n We are not given any missing values in the input, and we are generating without missing values.\n\n Let's output the data.\n",
