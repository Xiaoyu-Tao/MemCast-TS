        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing value warning, but the provided 96 points do not have any missing values in the given snippet.\n    However, we must be cautious and handle any potential missing values in the provided data? But the provided data for 96 points is complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the data is hourly and shows some daily patterns (with peaks and troughs), we can consider a model that captures:\n    - Seasonality: likely daily (24 hours) and possibly weekly? But we only have 4 days of data, so weekly seasonality might not be captured.\n    - Trend: from the data, there doesn't seem to be a strong long-term trend in 4 days, but we can consider local trends.\n\n 3. Given the constraints (only 96 points and forecasting 96 points ahead) and the requirement to provide a complete answer without omission, we choose a method that can handle multiple seasonality and is robust.\n\n 4. Since we are in a simulated environment and cannot run actual code, we will use a simple method that can be reasoned:\n    - We can use a naive seasonal method: using the last available day (or average of the past days) as the forecast for the next days.\n\n 5. However, looking at the data, the patterns are not exactly repeating. For example:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-05-13): \n            peaks at 12:00 (4.904) and 13:00 (4.975), then drops.\n\n        Day 2 (2017-05-14): \n            peaks at 11:00 (1.635) and 12:00 (0.817) -> note: the peak is much lower and at a different hour.\n\n        Day 3 (2017-05-15): \n            peaks at 00:00 (1.492) and then at 10:00 (0.533) and 11:00 (0.995) but then a very low value at 12:00 (0.107)\n\n        Day 4 (2017-05-16): \n            peaks at 10:00 (1.954) and then 11:00 (0.959) and 12:00 (0.853)\n\n    The data is volatile and does not show a clear daily pattern. Therefore, a simple seasonal naive might not be the best.\n\n 6. Alternative: We can use an average of the last 4 days for each hour. But note that the last day (2017-05-16) has negative values at the end, which might be an anomaly.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and without running a model, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, we are required to forecast 96 points.\n\n 8. Considering the above, we will use the forecast by taking the average of each hour across the four days we have 4 days of data, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 observations.\n\n    For example, for hour 00:00: \n        Day1: 0.320\n        Day2: 0.249\n        Day3: 1.492\n        Day4: 0.071\n        Average = (0.320+0.249+1.492+0.071)/4 = 2.132/4 = 0.533\n\n Similarly, we can compute for each hour of the day.\n\n 9. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will repeat the same 24-hour pattern (the computed average for each hour) for 4 days.\n\n 10. However, note that the data on 2017-05-16 has negative values at the end. We must be cautious: if the average for an hour is negative, we output it.\n\n 11. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (0.320, 0.249, 1.492, 0.071) -> 0.533\n        Hour 1: (0.497, 0.284, 1.350, 0.320) -> (0.497+0.284+1.350+0.320)/4 = 2.451/4 = 0.61275\n        Hour 2: (0.711, 0.320, 1.208, 0.391) -> (0.711+0.320+1.208+0.391)=2.63/4=0.6575\n        Hour 3: (0.604, 0.249, 1.066, 0.213) -> (0.604+0.249+1.066+0.213)=2.132/4=0.533\n        Hour 4: (0.391, 0.178, 1.350, 0.036) -> (0.391+0.178+1.350+0.036)=1.955/4=0.48875\n        Hour 5: (0.391, 0.142, 1.208, 0.036) -> (0.391+0.142+1.208+0.036)=1.777/4=0.44425\n        Hour 6: (0.497, 0.178, 1.244, 0.142) -> (0.497+0.178+1.244+0.142)=2.061/4=0.51525\n        Hour 7: (0.213, 0.284, 0.853, 0.142) -> (0.213+0.284+0.853+0.142)=1.492/4=0.373\n        Hour 8: (0.426, 0.462, 0.355, 0.284) -> (0.426+0.462+0.355+0.284)=1.527/4=0.38175\n        Hour 9: (0.711, 0.853, 0.320, 0.355) -> (0.711+0.853+0.320+0.355)=2.239/4=0.55975\n        Hour10: (1.031, 0.959, 0.533, 1.954) -> (1.031+0.959+0.533+1.954)=4.477/4=1.11925\n        Hour11: (1.066, 1.635, 0.995, 0.959) -> (1.066+1.635+0.995+0.959)=4.655/4=1.16375\n        Hour12: (4.904, 0.817, 0.107, 0.853) -> (4.904+0.817+0.107+0.853)=6.681/4=1.67025\n        Hour13: (4.975, 0.640, 0.284, 0.604) -> (4.975+0.640+0.284+0.604)=6.503/4=1.62575\n        Hour14: (4.087, 0.497, 0.320, 0.569) -> (4.087+0.497+0.320+0.569)=5.473/4=1.36825\n        Hour15: (0.711, 0.462, 0.426, 0.249) -> (0.711+0.462+0.426+0.249)=1.848/4=0.462\n        Hour16: (2.203, 0.284, 0.213, 0.249) -> (2.203+0.284+0.213+0.249)=2.949/4=0.73725\n        Hour17: (0.640, 0.355, 0.355, 0.178) -> (0.640+0.355+0.355+0.178)=1.528/4=0.382\n        Hour18: (0.711, 0.391, 0.355, 0.178) -> (0.711+0.391+0.355+0.178)=1.635/4=0.40875\n        Hour19: (0.569, 0.391, 0.284, -0.071) -> (0.569+0.391+0.284-0.071)=1.173/4=0.29325\n        Hour20: (0.711, 0.426, 0.284, -0.107) -> (0.711+0.426+0.284-0.107)=1.314/4=0.3285\n        Hour21: (0.604, 0.320, 0.249, -0.178) -> (0.604+0.320+0.249-0.178)=0.995/4=0.24875\n        Hour22: (0.569, 0.782, 0.000, -0.249) -> (0.569+0.782+0.000-0.249)=1.102/4=0.2755\n        Hour23: (0.533, 0.711, 0.213, -0.284) -> (0.533+0.711+0.213-0.284)=1.173/4=0.29325\n\n 12. Now, we will use these 24 hourly averages to form the next 4 days (from 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00).\n\n 13. The dates will be generated as:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-05-17 00:00:00 to 2017-05-17 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-05-18 00:00:00 to 2017-05-18 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-05-19 00:00:00 to 2017-05-19 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-05-20 00:00:00 to 2017-05-20 23:00:00\n\n 14. The MULL values for each hour in each day will be the same as the average for that hour.\n\n 15. Therefore, we will have:\n\n        2017-05-17 00:00:00: 0.533\n        2017-05-17 01:00:00: 0.61275\n        ... and so on for 24 hours of May 17, then repeat the same 24 numbers for May 18, 19, 20.\n\n 16. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are not given any in the provided 96 points. \n     We are only forecasting the provided method.\n\n 17. We output the data in the same format, with the date and MULL value, for 96 rows.\n\n 18. We must round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input data had 3 decimal places. So we round to 3 decimals.\n\n 19. Let's compute the averages and round them:\n\n        Hour0: 0.533 -> 0.533\n        Hour1: 0.61275 -> 0.613\n        Hour2: 0.6575 -> 0.658\n        Hour3: 0.533 -> 0.533\n        Hour4: 0.48875 -> 0.489\n        Hour5: 0.44425 -> 0.444\n        Hour6: 0.51525 -> 0.515\n        Hour7: 0.373 -> 0.373\n        Hour8: 0.38175 -> 0.382\n        Hour9: 0.55975 -> 0.560\n        Hour10: 1.11925 -> 1.119\n        Hour11: 1.16375 -> 1.164\n        Hour12: 1.67025 -> 1.670\n        Hour13: 1.62575 -> 1.626\n        Hour14: 1.36825 -> 1.368\n        Hour15: 0.462 -> 0.462\n        Hour16: 0.73725 -> 0.737\n        Hour17: 0.382 -> 0.382\n        Hour18: 0.40875 -> 0.409\n        Hour19: 0.29325 -> 0.293\n        Hour20: 0.3285 -> 0.328\n        Hour21: 0.24875 -> 0.249\n        Hour22: 0.2755 -> 0.276\n        Hour23: 0.29325 -> 0.293\n\n 20. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 17th May: [0.533, 0.613, 0.658, ... , 0.293] (24 values)\n        Day2: 18th May: same 24 values\n        Day3: 19th May: same\n        Day4: 20th May: same\n\n 21. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 22. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-17 00:00:00  0.533\n2017-05-17 01:00:00  0.613\n... (and so on for 96 rows)\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 23. Let's write the first day:\n\n        2017-05-17 00:00:00  0.533\n        2017-05-17 01:00:00  0.613\n        2017-05-17 02:00:00  0.658\n        2017-05-17 03:00:00  0.533\n        2017-05-17 04:00:00  0.489\n        2017-05-17 05:00:00  0.444\n        2017-05-17 06:00:00  0.515\n        2017-05-17 07:00:00  0.373\n        2017-05-17 08:00:00  0.382\n        2017-05-17 09:00:00  0.560\n        2017-05-17 10:00:00  1.119\n        2017-05-17 11:00:00  1.164\n        2017-05-17 12:00:00  1.670\n        2017-05-17 13:00:00  1.626\n        2017-05-17 14:00:00  1.368\n        2017-05-17 15:00:00  0.462\n        2017-05-17 16:00:00  0.737\n        2017-05-17 17:00:00  0.382\n        2017-05-17 18:00:00  0.409\n        2017-05-17 19:00:00  0.293\n        2017-05-17 20:00:00  0.328\n        2017-05-17 21:00:00  0.249\n        2017-05-17 22:00:00  0.276\n        2017-05-17 23:00:00  0.293\n\n    Then the next day (May 18) is the same 24 numbers, and so on.\n\n 24. We write all 96 rows.\n\n Note: This is a simple average method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) but given the constraints, we use this.\n\n Let's generate the full 96 rows.\n",
