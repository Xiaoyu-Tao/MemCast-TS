        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseFul Load (MUFL) of a transformer.\n The data has missing value note, but the provided data does not show explicit missing values. However, we should be cautious.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days).\n 2. We must handle any missing values in the provided data. Since the problem states there are missing values, but the provided sample does not have any, we assume the provided 96 points are complete? \n    However, the instruction says \"these data will have missing values\", so we should check and impute if necessary.\n\n But note: the user provided 96 rows without any gap? Actually, the data starts at 2017-05-21 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-05-24 23:00:00, which is exactly 4 days (96 hours). \n So the provided data is complete? However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. But in the given data, there are 96 rows and no missing time stamps? \n Actually, the timestamps are consecutive. However, we are told to be aware of missing values. Since the provided data does not have missing values, we proceed to forecasting.\n\n 3. We choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data is hourly and we have only 96 points (which is very limited for training), we might use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) if seasonality is present. We have daily seasonality (24 hours). \n    - Alternatively, we can use SARIMA model which can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. We note the data has a clear daily pattern: \n    - During the night (around 0-5) the values are positive and relatively stable (around 2-3), \n    - Then a drop in the morning (around 7-8) to negative values, \n    - Then becomes more negative until around 12-14, \n    - Then recovers to positive in the evening.\n\n 5. We will use a seasonal model. Since we have hourly data and seasonality of 24, but we only have 4 days, we might face challenges in fitting a seasonal model with 24 periods because we have only 4 seasons.\n\n 6. Given the limited data, we might use a simpler model. Alternatively, we can use a non-seasonal model for short-term forecasting, but 96 steps ahead is long.\n\n 7. We decide to use a model that can handle multiple seasonality? But we only have one seasonality (daily). \n\n 8. We can use the following approach:\n    - Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    - If non-stationary, we can take differences (both regular and seasonal).\n    - Then fit an ARIMA or SARIMA model.\n\n 9. However, with only 96 points and forecasting 96 points (which is the same length as the history), the uncertainty is high.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n     - Forecast each hour of the corresponding hour in the previous day? But we have 4 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n     - But note: the pattern might change over days? We see some variation.\n\n 11. We can also use a machine learning model? But with only 96 points, it's challenging.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we will use a simple method: \n     - We decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n     - Then we forecast the seasonal component by repeating the last seasonal period (or average of the available periods) and the trend by extending the last trend (or using a simple linear trend).\n\n 13. However, we have only 4 days, so we can compute the daily seasonality by averaging the 4 days for each hour? Then we can use that as the seasonal component for the next 4 days? \n     But we don't have a trend? We can also look for a trend in the 4 days? \n\n 14. Let's try to compute the average daily pattern:\n\n     We have 4 days: \n        Day1: 2017-05-21\n        Day2: 2017-05-22\n        Day3: 2017-05-23\n        Day4: 2017-05-24\n\n     We can average the values for each hour (0 to 23) over these 4 days.\n\n     However, we see that the values are not exactly the same each day. We can also consider if there is a weekly pattern? But we don't have enough data for that.\n\n 15. Steps for the simple method:\n     a) Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n     b) Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is simply the same daily pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 16. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level of each day:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values of day1) / 24\n        Day2: ... \n\n     We can compute:\n\n        Day1: 2017-05-21: \n            mean = (2.381+2.097+...+3.660)/24 -> we can calculate roughly: \n            We see positive in the night, negative in the day, and positive in the evening. \n            Let me compute: \n                We can do a quick estimate: \n                The positive values are around 2-4 (for about 10 hours) and negative values are around -10 to -17 (for about 10 hours) and some in between.\n                It might be around -1 or -2? \n\n        Actually, we can compute exactly:\n\n        We'll calculate the average_day1 = (2.381+2.097+1.990+1.954+2.061+4.548+3.873+1.492-4.584-10.838-13.112-12.189-16.844-17.839-15.067-11.407-6.752-1.208+2.594+3.909+4.158+3.625+3.020+3.660)/24\n\n        We can do it in code, but since we are in text, we'll approximate: \n        The positive part: about 2.38+2.1+2.0+1.95+2.06+4.55+3.87+1.49+2.59+3.91+4.16+3.63+3.02+3.66 = let's add: \n            2.38+2.1=4.48, +2.0=6.48, +1.95=8.43, +2.06=10.49, +4.55=15.04, +3.87=18.91, +1.49=20.4, \n            then the evening: 2.59+3.91=6.5, +4.16=10.66, +3.63=14.29, +3.02=17.31, +3.66=20.97 -> total positive = 20.4+20.97 = 41.37\n        The negative part: \n            -4.58, -10.84, -13.11, -12.19, -16.84, -17.84, -15.07, -11.41, -6.75, -1.21\n            negatives: 4.58+10.84=15.42, +13.11=28.53, +12.19=40.72, +16.84=57.56, +17.84=75.4, +15.07=90.47, +11.41=101.88, +6.75=108.63, +1.21=109.84 -> total negative = -109.84\n        Then total = 41.37 - 109.84 = -68.47\n        average_day1 = -68.47 / 24 = -2.85\n\n        Similarly, we can do for the other days? But we don't need to, because we are going to use the same pattern for each day? \n\n     However, we see that the level of the day might be changing? \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can remove the daily effect by subtracting the daily mean? Then we have the seasonal indices. Then we can forecast the daily mean for the next 4 days? \n\n     Steps:\n        Step 1: For each day, compute the daily mean.\n        Step 2: Subtract the daily mean from each hour of that day -> this gives the seasonal component (centered around zero).\n        Step 3: Average the seasonal component for each hour (0-23) over the 4 days -> this gives the average seasonal pattern.\n        Step 4: Forecast the daily mean for the next 4 days? How? We can use a simple method: take the average of the 4 daily means? or use a linear regression? \n                But we have only 4 points. We can use the last daily mean? or the average? \n        Step 5: Then for each day in the forecast, we add the forecasted daily mean to the seasonal index for that hour.\n\n 18. Let's compute:\n\n      Day1: 2017-05-21: \n          mean1 = (as above) we computed -2.85?

We do the following:\n\n      For each day d and hour h, we have:\n          value(d,h) = daily_mean(d) + seasonal_index(h) + residual(d,h)\n\n      We want to estimate the seasonal_index(h) such that the average over d for a fixed h is zero? \n\n      How to compute seasonal_index(h): \n          We can compute the average for hour h: \n             avg_h = (value(d1,h) + value(d2,h) + value(d3,h) + value(d4,h)) / 4\n          Then the overall average of the data is overall_mean (which we computed as -1.0582916666666667)\n          But the average of the daily means is -0.808292, which is not the same as the overall_mean? \n\n      Actually, the overall_mean is the same as the average of the daily means? \n          Because: \n             total = (daily_mean1*24 + daily_mean2*24 + daily_mean4*24) / 96 = (daily_mean1+daily_mean2+daily_mean3+daily_mean4)/4 = average_daily_mean = -0.808292? \n          But we computed overall_mean = -1.0582916666666667? \n\n          Why? \n\n          Let me recalc: \n            day1: 24 * (-2.85325) = -68.478\n            day2: 24 * (-2.210583) = -53.054\n            day3: 24 * 2.67254 = 64.14096\n            day4: 24 * (-1.841875) = -44.205\n            total = -68.478 -53.054 +64.14096 -44.205 = \n                   = (-68.478-53.054-44.205) +64.14096 = -165.737 +64.14096 = -101.59604\n            overall_mean = -101.59604 / 96 = -1.0582916666666667\n\n          And the average_daily_mean = (-2.85325-2.210583+2.67254-1.841875)/4 = (-4.253168)/4 = -1.063292? \n          Actually: \n            -2.85325 -2.210583 = -5.063833\n            -5.063833 +2.67254 = -2.391293\n            -2.391293 -1.841875 = -4.233168\n            -4.233168/4 = -1.058292\n\n          So they are the same? \n\n      Therefore, we can compute the seasonal indices as:\n\n          seasonal_index(h) = avg_h - overall_mean\n\n      But note: the average of the seasonal indices over 24 hours should be zero? \n\n      Alternatively, we can compute the average for hour h (avg_h) and then subtract the overall_mean? \n\n      Then the forecast for a future day and hour h is: \n          forecast(d', h) = overall_mean + seasonal_index(h)\n\n      But this would be the same for every day? \n\n 23. However, we see that the daily level is changing. We might want to adjust by the daily level? \n\n      We don't have a forecast for the daily level for the next 4 days. \n\n      We can use the average_daily_mean (which is the overall_mean) for each day? \n\n      Then the forecast for every hour h in any future day is: \n          forecast = overall_mean + (avg_h - overall_mean) = avg_h\n\n      So we are just repeating the average of the 4 days for each hour? \n\n      Example for hour 0: \n          values: 2.381 (day1), 2.381 (day2), 2.772 (day3), 1.777 (day4)\n          avg_0 = (2.381+2.381+2.772+1.777)/4 = (9.311)/4 = 2.32775\n\n      Then the forecast for the next 4 days at hour 0 will be 2.32775.\n\n 24. This is a simple and reasonable approach given the data.\n\n 25. Steps for the forecast:\n\n      For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n      Then for the next 4 days (96 hours), we repeat this average pattern 4 times.\n\n 26. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0: (2.381 + 2.381 + 2.772 + 1.777) / 4 = (2.311+2.381=4.692, +2.772=7.464, +1.777=9.241) -> 9.241/4 = 2.31025\n      hour1: (2.097+2.559+2.914+1.706)/4 = (2.097+2.559=4.656, +2.914=7.57, +1.706=9.276) -> 9.276/4=2.319\n      hour2: (1.990+2.914+3.376+1.670)/4 = (1.990+2.914=4.904, +3.376=8.28, +1.670=9.95) -> 9.95/4=2.4875\n      hour3: (1.954+2.949+3.234+1.635)/4 = (1.954+2.949=4.903, +3.234=8.137, +1.635=9.772) -> 9.772/4=2.443\n      hour4: (2.061+3.198+3.767+1.706)/4 = (2.061+3.198=5.259, +3.767=9.026, +1.706=10.732) -> 10.732/4=2.683\n      hour5: (4.548+4.797+4.300+2.523)/4 = (4.548+4.797=9.345, +4.300=13.645, +2.523=16.168) -> 16.168/4=4.042\n      hour6: (3.873+4.371+4.904+4.655)/4 = (3.873+4.371=8.244, +4.904=13.148, +4.655=17.803) -> 17.803/4=4.45075\n      hour7: (1.492+0.853+3.020+4.477)/4 = (1.492+0.853=2.345, +3.020=5.365, +4.477=9.842) -> 9.842/4=2.4605\n      hour8: (-4.584-4.442+2.310+1.208)/4 = (-4.584-4.442=-9.026, +2.310=-6.716, +1.208=-5.508) -> -5.508/4=-1.377\n      hour9: (-10.838-8.031+2.203+0.142)/4 = (-10.838-8.031=-18.869, +2.203=-16.666, +0.142=-16.524) -> -16.524/4=-4.131\n      hour10: (-13.112-11.869+2.949-15.245)/4 = (-13.112-11.869=-24.981, +2.949=-22.032, -15.245=-37.277) -> -37.277/4=-9.31925\n      hour11: (-12.189-14.356+2.665-15.991)/4 = (-12.189-14.356=-26.545, +2.665=-23.88, -15.991=-39.871) -> -39.871/4=-9.96775\n      hour12: (-16.844-16.595+0.462-18.549)/4 = (-16.844-16.595=-33.439, +0.462=-32.977, -18.549=-51.526) -> -51.526/4=-12.8815\n      hour13: (-17.839-16.133+1.741-15.955)/4 = (-17.839-16.133=-33.972, +1.741=-32.231, -15.955=-48.186) -> -48.186/4=-12.0465\n      hour14: (-15.067-11.265+1.137-11.300)/4 = (-15.067-11.265=-26.332, +1.137=-25.195, -11.300=-36.495) -> -36.495/4=-9.12375\n      hour15: (-11.407-11.087+1.208-6.787)/4 = (-11.407-11.087=-22.494, +1.208=-21.286, -6.787=-28.073) -> -28.073/4=-7.01825\n      hour16: (-6.752-5.792+1.954-3.802)/4 = (-6.752-5.792=-12.544, +1.954=-10.59, -3.802=-14.392) -> -14.392/4=-3.598\n      hour17: (-1.208+1.528+2.914+2.630)/4 = (-1.208+1.528=0.32, +2.914=3.234, +2.630=5.864) -> 5.864/4=1.466\n      hour18: (2.594+3.589+2.878+2.132)/4 = (2.594+3.589=6.183, +2.878=9.061, +2.132=11.193) -> 11.193/4=2.79825\n      hour19: (3.909+4.122+3.127+3.589)/4 = (3.909+4.122=8.031, +3.127=11.158, +3.589=14.747) -> 14.747/4=3.68675\n      hour20: (4.158+3.909+3.092+3.802)/4 = (4.158+3.909=8.067, +3.092=11.159, +3.802=14.961) -> 14.961/4=3.74025\n      hour21: (3.625+3.447+2.807+3.447)/4 = (3.625+3.447=7.072, +2.807=9.879, +3.447=13.326) -> 13.326/4=3.3315\n      hour22: (3.020+3.340+2.310+3.411)/4 = (3.020+3.340=6.36, +2.310=8.67, +3.411=12.081) -> 12.081/4=3.02025\n      hour23: (3.660+2.559+2.097+2.914)/4 = (3.660+2.559=6.219, +2.097=8.316, +2.914=11.23) -> 11.23/4=2.8075\n\n 27. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-05-25 00:00:00 to 2017-05-28 23:00:00) is:\n\n        Day1: 2017-05-25: [hour0 to hour23] = [2.31025, 2.319, 2.4875, 2.443, 2.683, 4.042, 4.45075, 2.4605, -1.377, -4.131, -9.31925, -9.96775, -12.8815, -12.0465, -9.12375, -7.01825, -3.598, 1.466, 2.79825, 3.68675, 3.74025, 3.3315, 3.02025, 2.8075]\n        Day2: 2017-05-26: same as above\n        Day3: 2017-05-27: same\n        Day4: 2017-05-28: same\n\n 28. But note: the dates must be generated correctly.\n\n      The last date is 2017-05-24 23:00:00. Then the next date is 2017-05-25 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2017-05-28 23:00:00.\n\n 29.

However, note: the original data has 3 decimal places? We will round to 3 decimal places? \n\n      The original data has 3 decimal places, so we will round our averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. Let's round the computed average for each hour to 3 decimal places:\n\n      hour0: 2.310 -> 2.310 (but we had 2.31025 -> 2.310)\n      Actually, we computed 2.31025 -> rounding to 3 decimals: 2.310\n      hour1: 2.319 -> 2.319\n      hour2: 2.4875 -> 2.488\n      hour3: 2.443 -> 2.443\n      hour4: 2.683 -> 2.683\n      hour5: 4.042 -> 4.042\n      hour6: 4.45075 -> 4.451\n      hour7: 2.4605 -> 2.461\n      hour8: -1.377 -> -1.377\n      hour9: -4.131 -> -4.131\n      hour10: -9.31925 -> -9.319\n      hour11: -9.96775 -> -9.968\n      hour12: -12.8815 -> -12.882\n      hour13: -12.0465 -> -12.047\n      hour14: -9.12375 -> -9.124\n      hour15: -7.01825 -> -7.018\n      hour16: -3.598 -> -3.598\n      hour17: 1.466 -> 1.466\n      hour18: 2.79825 -> 2.798\n      hour19: 3.68675 -> 3.687\n      hour20: 3.74025 -> 3.740\n      hour21: 3.3315 -> 3.332\n      hour22: 3.02025 -> 3.020\n      hour23: 2.8075 -> 2.808\n\n 33. Then the forecast for each day is the same 24 values.\n\n 34.

But note: the dates must be consecutive.\n\n 36. We generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-25 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-05-25 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-25 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n        Then 2017-05-26 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 -> next 24\n        Then 2017-05-27 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Then 2017-05-28 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 37. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 38. We output in the required format.\n\n 39. Note: This is a simple average method.
