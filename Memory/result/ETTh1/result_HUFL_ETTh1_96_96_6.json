        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours) and also intra-day patterns.\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data for the past 96 hours is complete.\n 3. We will use a time series forecasting model. Given the hourly data and seasonality, we can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality), or even a simple seasonal naive method.\n\n However, note that we are to provide a complete set of 96 forecasted values. Since we are an expert, we can choose a robust method.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are in a text-based environment, we will use a simple yet effective method: \n   - We will use the last week of data (which is 7*24=168 hours, but we only have 96 hours, which is 4 days) to capture the daily pattern.\n   - Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour in the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n Approach:\n   We observe that the data has a daily cycle (24 periods). We can compute the average pattern for a day from the available 4 days and then use that to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n   However, note that the data might have a trend or changing patterns. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a weekly pattern. \n\n   Let's break the data into 4 days (each 24 hours). We have:\n        Day1: 2016-07-25\n        Day2: 2016-07-26\n        Day3: 2016-07-27\n        Day4: 2016-07-28\n\n   We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over these 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-07-29 to 2016-08-01).\n\n   But note: the last day (2016-07-28) might be the most representative? Or we can use a weighted average? However, the problem does not specify a trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days. Since we are forecasting 4 days, we can use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h on day 5 (2016-07-29) = average of hour h on days 1,2,3,4\n        Similarly for day 6,7,8? But we only have 4 days of history.\n\n   However, we are forecasting 4 days. We can use the same daily pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data has missing values in general, but the provided 96 points are complete. So we can use them.\n\n   Steps for forecasting:\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23):\n            avg_h = (value at that hour on day1 + day2 + day3 + day4) / 4\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n            Day5 (2016-07-29): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n            Day6 (2016-07-30): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n            Day7 (2016-07-31): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n            Day8 (2016-08-01): [avg_0, avg_1, ..., avg_23]\n\n   However, this method ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable simple approach.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We have 4 days, each with 24 hours.\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values for that hour across the 4 days.\n\n   Example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 16.745001\n        Day2: 17.884001\n        Day3: 16.677999\n        Day4: 21.434000\n        Average = (16.745001 + 17.884001 + 16.677999 + 21.434000) / 4 = 18.18525\n\n   Similarly for the rest.\n\n 4. Generate the dates for the next 96 hours (starting from 2016-07-29 00:00:00 to 2016-08-01 23:00:00).\n\n 5. Format the answer as required.\n\n However, note: the problem says that the data might have missing values, but in the provided history there are none. We are only forecasting the next 96, and we are to provide complete data.\n\n Let's code the averaging:\n\n   We'll create a 2D array (4 rows, 24 columns) and then take the mean for each column.\n\n   But note: the data we have is 96 consecutive hours. We can reshape into 4x24.\n\n   Then, for each hour of the day (column index j from 0 to 23), compute:\n        avg[j] = (data[0][j] + data[1][j] + data[2][j] + data[3][j]) / 4\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days is just repeating the avg array 4 times.\n\n 6. But note: the last day in the history is 2016-07-28, so the next day is 2016-07-29.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the HUFL values as a list of 96 numbers.\n   Step 2: Reshape to 4x24.\n   Step 3: Compute the average for each hour (across the 4 days).\n   Step 4: Create the forecast for the next 4 days by repeating the average pattern 4 times.\n\n   However, we can also consider that the pattern might be evolving. Another approach is to use the last day (2016-07-28) as the pattern for the next day, then the day before that for the next, but that would be a naive forecast.\n\n   But the problem does not specify the method. We are an expert and we choose a simple average by hour.\n\n   Let's do the calculation.\n\n   We'll write a small code in our mind:\n\n        data = [ ... 96 values ... ]\n\n        # Reshape\n        data_2d = [ [ data[0:24] ], [ data[24:48] ], [ data[48:72] ], [ data[72:96] ] ]\n\n        avg = []\n        for j in range(24):\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(4):\n                total += data_2d[i][j]\n            avg.append(total / 4)\n\n        forecast = avg * 4   # repeat the list 4 times\n\n   Then we have 96 forecasted values.\n\n 7. Generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-29 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 96 hours.\n\n        The last date: 2016-07-29 23:00:00 (day1), then 2016-07-30 00:00:00 ... until 2016-08-01 23:00:00.\n\n 8. Format the output as:\n\n        <answer>\n        date, HUFL\n        2016-07-29 00:00:00, [value1]\n        2016-07-29 01:00:00, [value2]\n        ...\n        2016-08-01 23:00:00, [value96]\n\n        </answer>\n\n But note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, we must note: the average might have more decimals. We'll round to 6 decimal places as in the input? The input has up to 6 decimal places.\n\n Let's compute the average for the first hour (00:00) as an example:\n\n        Day1: 16.745001\n        Day2: 17.884001\n        Day3: 16.677999\n        Day4: 21.434000\n\n        Sum = 16.745001 + 17.884001 = 34.629002\n              + 16.677999 = 51.307001\n              + 21.434000 = 72.741001\n\n        Average = 72.741001 / 4 = 18.18525025 -> rounded to 6 decimals: 18.185250\n\n But note: the input data has 3 or 6? Actually, the input has mixed: some have 3, some 6. We'll output 6 decimal places to be consistent with the input.\n\n However, the problem does not specify, but we see the input has up to 6. So we'll output 6.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\". So we output the full float representation? But we can round to 6 decimals.\n\n Let's do the computation for all 24 hours.\n\n However, we are an AI and we can compute. We'll do it step by step.\n\n But note: we are to provide the answer in the required format. We'll write a program in our mind and then output the table.\n\n Alternatively, we can write a Python code to compute, but since we are in text, we'll do it manually for 24 hours? That's too long.\n\n Instead, we can describe the method and then output the forecasted values by computing the averages.\n\n But the problem requires the complete data.\n\n We decide to compute the 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n We'll compute the averages:\n\n   hour0: (16.745001 + 17.884001 + 16.677999 + 21.434000) / 4 = 72.741001 / 4 = 18.18525025 -> 18.185250\n   hour1: (16.275999 + 18.419001 + 14.401000 + 19.558001) / 4 = (16.275999+18.419001=34.695; +14.401000=49.096; +19.558001=68.654001) -> 68.654001/4=17.16350025 -> 17.163500\n   hour2: (16.142000 + 15.874000 + 14.468000 + 18.955000) / 4 = (16.142+15.874=32.016; +14.468=46.484; +18.955=65.439) -> 65.439/4=16.359750\n   hour3: (15.137000 + 16.007999 + 14.267000 + 16.812000) / 4 = (15.137+16.007999=31.144999; +14.267=45.411999; +16.812=62.223999) -> 62.223999/4=15.55599975 -> 15.556000\n   hour4: (13.195000 + 12.927000 + 14.066000 + 17.281000) / 4 = (13.195+12.927=26.122; +14.066=40.188; +17.281=57.469) -> 57.469/4=14.367250\n   hour5: (12.659000 + 12.927000 + 12.659000 + 17.080000) / 4 = (12.659+12.927=25.586; +12.659=38.245; +17.080=55.325) -> 55.325/4=13.831250\n   hour6: (12.592000 + 12.994000 + 13.195000 + 14.669000) / 4 = (12.592+12.994=25.586; +13.195=38.781; +14.669=53.45) -> 53.45/4=13.362500\n   hour7: (5.023000 + 13.798000 + 11.655000 + 14.937000) / 4 = (5.023+13.798=18.821; +11.655=30.476; +14.937=45.413) -> 45.413/4=11.353250\n   hour8: (3.215000 + 11.052000 + 12.123000 + 11.119000) / 4 = (3.215+11.052=14.267; +12.123=26.39; +11.119=37.509) -> 37.509/4=9.377250\n   hour9: (3.550000 + 11.655000 + 12.659000 + 12.391000) / 4 = (3.55+11.655=15.205; +12.659=27.864; +12.391=40.255) -> 40.255/4=10.063750\n   hour10: (4.019000 + 13.329000 + 14.937000 + 14.267000) / 4 = (4.019+13.329=17.348; +14.937=32.285; +14.267=46.552) -> 46.552/4=11.638000\n   hour11: (5.961000 + 14.334000 + 15.472000 + 14.267000) / 4 = (5.961+14.334=20.295; +15.472=35.767; +14.267=50.034) -> 50.034/4=12.508500\n   hour12: (13.932000 + 14.937000 + 16.275999 + 15.606000) / 4 = (13.932+14.937=28.869; +16.275999=45.144999; +15.606=60.750999) -> 60.750999/4=15.18774975 -> 15.187750\n   hour13: (14.736000 + 15.740000 + 16.611000 + 16.075001) / 4 = (14.736+15.740=30.476; +16.611=47.087; +16.075001=63.162001) -> 63.162001/4=15.79050025 -> 15.790500\n   hour14: (13.664000 + 15.405000 + 16.075001 + 16.075001) / 4 = (13.664+15.405=29.069; +16.075001=45.144001; +16.075001=61.219002) -> 61.219002/4=15.3047505 -> 15.304750\n   hour15: (13.865000 + 13.597000 + 15.137000 + 15.405000) / 4 = (13.865+13.597=27.462; +15.137=42.599; +15.405=58.004) -> 58.004/4=14.501000\n   hour16: (12.860000 + 13.329000 + 12.994000 + 13.999000) / 4 = (12.860+13.329=26.189; +12.994=39.183; +13.999=53.182) -> 53.182/4=13.295500\n   hour17: (12.458000 + 13.128000 + 12.860000 + 13.530000) / 4 = (12.458+13.128=25.586; +12.860=38.446; +13.530=51.976) -> 51.976/4=12.994000\n   hour18: (12.123000 + 12.793000 + 12.726000 + 12.994000) / 4 = (12.123+12.793=24.916; +12.726=37.642; +12.994=50.636) -> 50.636/4=12.659000\n   hour19: (13.262000 + 13.932000 + 14.133000 + 13.865000) / 4 = (13.262+13.932=27.194; +14.133=41.327; +13.865=55.192) -> 55.192/4=13.798000\n   hour20: (17.615999 + 18.754000 + 19.156000 + 18.955000) / 4 = (17.615999+18.754000=36.369999; +19.156000=55.525999; +18.955000=74.480999) -> 74.480999/4=18.62024975 -> 18.620250\n   hour21: (17.750000 + 16.812000 + 18.285999 + 18.419001) / 4 = (17.750+16.812=34.562; +18.285999=52.847999; +18.419001=71.267) -> 71.267/4=17.816750\n   hour22: (17.348000 + 17.482000 + 19.424000 + 17.482000) / 4 = (17.348+17.482=34.83; +19.424=54.254; +17.482=71.736) -> 71.736/4=17.934000\n   hour23: (16.075001 + 17.415001 + 19.290001 + 17.415001) / 4 = (16.075001+17.415001=33.490002; +19.290001=52.780003; +17.415001=70.195004) -> 70.195004/4=17.548751\n\n   Now, we have the 24 averages.

We'll include the header? The problem says \"complete data\", so we include the header.\n\n   However, the example output format in the problem did not show a header. But the input had two columns: date and HUFL.\n\n   The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning the data in the same format? But the input was given without a header in the example? Actually, the input was given as:\n\n        date      HUFL\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00 16.745001\n\n   But in the example, we are to output in the same way? The problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\".\n\n   We'll output with the header and then the 96 rows.\n\n   But note: the problem's example input had the header and then the data. So we output:\n\n        date,HUFL\n        2016-07-29 00:00:00,18.185250\n        ...\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", and the example input had the header. So we include the header.\n\n   But the problem's example format for the answer was:\n\n        <answer>\n\n        ...\n\n        </answer>\n\n   And the ... was the data. So we write:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,HUFL\n        2016-07-29 00:00:00,18.185250\n        ... (96 lines)\n        </answer>\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   However, note: the problem input had a space between the date and the number, but we are using a comma. The problem says \"the complete data\", and the input was given with a space. But in the problem statement, it was printed with a space, but in the code block it was with a space? Actually, the problem wrote:\n\n        \"               date      HUFL\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00 16.745001\"\n\n   But we are to output in the same format? Or we can output as CSV? The problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem says \"the complete data\", and the example input had two columns, we can output as two columns separated by a comma? Or by space? \n\n   But note: the problem's example answer format did not specify. We'll use comma for CSV-like because it's clear.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use space and align? But the problem did not require alignment.\n\n   We'll output: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,value\" for each line.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,HUFL\n        2016-07-29 00:00:00,18.185250\n        2016-07-29 01:00:00,17.163500\n        ... \n        </answer>\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n   We have the 24 averages in a list:\n\n        avg = [18.185250, 17.163500, 16.359750, 15.556000, 14.367250, 13.831250, 13.362500, 11.353250, 9.377250, 10.063750, 11.638000, 12.508500, 15.187750, 15.790500, 15.304750, 14.501000, 13.295500, 12.994000, 12.659000, 13.798000, 18.620250, 17.816750, 17.934000, 17.548751]\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days is: \n        day1: avg[0] to avg[23]\n        day2: avg[0] to avg[23]\n        day3: avg[0] to avg[23]\n        day4: avg[0] to avg[23]\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-29 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-07-29 01:00:00, ... until 2016-07-29 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-07-30 00:00:00 ... until 2016-07-30 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-07-31 00:00:00 ... until 2016-07-31 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-08-01 00:00:00 ... until 2016-08-01 23:00:00\n\n   We'll write a loop for 4 days, and for each day, loop for 24 hours.\n\n   We'll use Python-like pseudocode to generate the dates:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016, 7, 29, 0, 0, 0)\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                current_date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # but note: we are adding hours: so we can do base_date + timedelta(hours= hour_index) where hour_index from 0 to 95.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            start = datetime(2016, 7, 29, 0, 0, 0)\n            for i in range(96):\n                current = start + timedelta(hours=i)\n                value = avg[i % 24]\n\n   But we are writing the answer by hand? We can generate the list.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   However, to save space and avoid manual error, we can compute the averages and then write the 96 lines in the answer.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        Line 1: 2016-07-29 00:00:00,18.185250\n        Line 2: 2016-07-29 01:00:00,17.163500\n        ...\n        Line 24: 2016-07-29 23:00:00,17.548751\n        Line 25: 2016-07-30 00:00:00,18.185250\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll output the entire 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\" and \"You mustn't omit any content\", so we must write all 96.\n\n   We'll do it.\n\n   However, the answer might be long. But the problem requires it.\n\n   We write the answer block.\n\n   Note: We rounded the averages to 6 decimal places as above.\n\n   Let's write the answer.\n",
