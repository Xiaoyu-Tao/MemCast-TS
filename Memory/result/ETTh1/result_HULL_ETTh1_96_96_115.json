        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-10-04 00:00:00 to 2017-10-07 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but the problem says to be aware of missing values. However, the provided data for the past 96 is complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the relatively short history (4 days), we can consider:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) if there is seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we might assume daily seasonality (24 hours).\n    - Alternatively, an ARIMA model or a simple moving average.\n\n 3. However, the data shows:\n      - A clear daily cycle (observe the pattern repeating every 24 hours, but with some variation).\n      - The values are not stationary (mean and variance change over time).\n\n 4. We will use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components. But note: we have only 4 days, so we can only assume a daily seasonality of 24 periods.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a model that can handle seasonality and trend, such as the Holt-Winters method.\n\n 6. Since the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are to forecast for, but we are only given the past 96 without missing values, we can proceed.\n\n 7. We will use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, with additive or multiplicative seasonality.\n\n 8. Let's check the data: \n      - The data does not shown an increasing trend in the level, but there are peaks and troughs. \n      - The amplitude of the seasonality does not seem to change dramatically, so we can try additive.\n\n 9. We will fit an ExponentialSmoothing model with a seasonal period of 24 (for daily seasonality, since we have hourly data) and additive trend and seasonal components.\n\n 10. However, note that the data we have is only 4 days (96 hours). This is very short for a seasonal model, but we have no choice.\n\n 11. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n      - Import necessary libraries (pandas, statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters)\n      - Create a time series with a frequency of 'H'\n      - Fit a model: ExponentialSmoothing(series, seasonal_periods=24, trend='add', seasonal='add', initialization_method='estimated').fit()\n      - Forecast next 96 steps.\n\n 12. But note: we are not allowed to run code? We are to reason and then generate the forecast.\n\n 13. Since we cannot run code, we must rely on patterns and extrapolation.\n\n 14. Observing the data:\n\n      Day 1 (2017-10-04): \n        - Values range from -1.474 to 1.34, with a low at 16:00 and highs at 00:00, 02:00, 10:00.\n\n      Day 2 (2017-10-05): \n        - Similar pattern: low at 16:00? Actually, the low on day2 is at 16:00? But the values are not as low as day1. \n        - Highs at 10:00, 11:00, and then 23:00.\n\n      Day 3 (2017-10-06): \n        - Highs at 10:00 (4.287) and then 13:00 (3.148), and lows at 18:00 (0.335) and 21:00 (0.201).\n\n      Day 4 (2017-10-07): \n        - Highs at 12:00 (6.564) and 13:00 (6.296), and lows at 18:00 (0.536).\n\n      The pattern is not exactly the same, but we see:\n        - The load tends to be low during the early morning (around 4-6) and then increases during the day, with peaks in the afternoon and then drops at night? \n        - But the peaks are at different times.\n\n 15. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide 96 numbers, we must generate a forecast.\n\n 16. We can use a naive method: \n        - Use the average of the last 4 days for each hour. But note: the last day (2017-10-07) has a much higher peak (6.564) than the others.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a moving average with seasonality: \n        - For the first hour (00:00) of the next day (2017-10-08), we take the average of the 00:00 of the previous 4 days: \n            2017-10-04: 1.340, 2017-10-05: 0.536, 2017-10-06: 2.076, 2017-10-07: 1.875 -> average = (1.340+0.536+2.076+1.875)/4 = 1.45675\n        - Similarly for 01:00: (1.206, 0.603, 2.076, 2.277) -> (1.206+0.603+2.076+2.277)/4 = 1.5405\n\n 18. But note: the problem says there might be missing values? We are not missing in the provided data, so we can use the provided 4 days.\n\n 19. However, the data shows an increasing trend? The last day (2017-10-07) has much higher values. So we might want to give more weight to the recent days.\n\n 20. We can use a weighted average: \n        - Weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] for the days from oldest to newest.\n\n        For 00:00: \n          1.340 * 0.1 + 0.536 * 0.2 + 2.076 * 0.3 + 1.875 * 0.4 = \n          0.134 + 0.1072 + 0.6228 + 0.75 = 1.614\n\n 21. But without a clear trend, and only 4 days, we might also consider that the next day (2017-10-08) is a Monday? and the previous days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. \n        - The pattern on weekends might be different? But we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality.\n\n 22. Given the constraints, we will use the simple average of the last 4 days for each hour.\n\n 23. However, note that the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can use them.\n\n 24. We will generate 96 points (4 days) by taking the average of the same hour for the past 4 days.\n\n 25. But let's check: the last day (2017-10-07) is a Saturday. The next day (2017-10-08) is a Sunday, then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? \n        - We don't have a Sunday in the past data? We have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n 26. We don't have the same day of the week, so we cannot do day-of-week averaging. Therefore, we stick to the last 4 days.\n\n 27. We'll compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n 28. Steps:\n        For hour h in [0,23]:\n            value_h = (h0 + h1 + h2 + h3) / 4\n            where h0 is the value at hour h on 2017-10-04, h1 on 2017-10-05, h2 on 2017-10-06, h3 on 2017-10-07.\n\n 29. Then we repeat this average for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 30. But note: the next 4 days are 2017-10-08 (Sunday), 2017-10-09 (Monday), 2017-10-10 (Tuesday), 2017-10-11 (Wednesday). \n        - We are using the same pattern for each day? So the Sunday will have the same pattern as the average of the past 4 days (which are Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat). \n        - This might not be accurate, but we have no other data.\n\n 31. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Saturday) as the pattern for Sunday? But we don't know.\n\n 32. Given the instructions, we must provide the data. We choose the average method.\n\n 33. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.340 + 0.536 + 2.076 + 1.875) / 4 = (5.827) / 4 = 1.45675\n        hour1: (1.206 + 0.603 + 2.076 + 2.277) / 4 = (6.162) / 4 = 1.5405\n        hour2: (1.340 + 0.603 + 1.005 + 1.808) / 4 = (4.756) / 4 = 1.189\n        ... and so on.\n\n 34. We do this for 24 hours and then repeat the same 24-hour pattern for 4 days.\n\n 35. However, note that the data does not show a stable pattern? The Saturday was much higher. But without more data, we average.\n\n 36. We'll compute the 24 averages and then replicate them 4 times.\n\n 37. But note: the problem says to be aware of missing values. We are not missing in the provided data, so we use the provided data.\n\n 38. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n 39. We'll calculate the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (1.340, 0.536, 2.076, 1.875) -> 1.45675\n        hour1: (1.206, 0.603, 2.076, 2.277) -> 1.5405\n        hour2: (1.340, 0.603, 1.005, 1.808) -> (1.340+0.603+1.005+1.808)=4.756 -> 1.189\n        hour3: (1.206, 0.603, 2.009, 1.674) -> (1.206+0.603+2.009+1.674)=5.492 -> 1.373\n        hour4: (0.201, -0.067, 1.808, 2.210) -> (0.201 -0.067 +1.808+2.210)=4.152 -> 1.038\n        hour5: (0.469, 0.067, 1.139, 0.804) -> (0.469+0.067+1.139+0.804)=2.479 -> 0.61975\n        hour6: (0.067, 0.536, 1.674, 1.942) -> (0.067+0.536+1.674+1.942)=4.219 -> 1.05475\n        hour7: (0.603, 0.670, 2.143, 3.282) -> (0.603+0.670+2.143+3.282)=6.698 -> 1.6745\n        hour8: (-0.402, 1.139, 2.746, 3.282) -> (-0.402+1.139+2.746+3.282)=6.765 -> 1.69125\n        hour9: (-0.268, 1.407, 1.407, 4.153) -> (-0.268+1.407+1.407+4.153)=6.699 -> 1.67475\n        hour10: (1.206, 1.942, 4.287, 5.425) -> (1.206+1.942+4.287+5.425)=12.86 -> 3.215\n        hour11: (0.536, 1.541, 1.942, 6.095) -> (0.536+1.541+1.942+6.095)=10.114 -> 2.5285\n        hour12: (1.005, 1.139, 2.545, 6.564) -> (1.005+1.139+2.545+6.564)=11.253 -> 2.81325\n        hour13: (0.067, 0.804, 3.148, 6.296) -> (0.067+0.804+3.148+6.296)=10.315 -> 2.57875\n        hour14: (-0.871, 0.737, 2.076, 5.157) -> (-0.871+0.737+2.076+5.157)=7.099 -> 1.77475\n        hour15: (-0.536, 0.536, 2.277, 3.684) -> (-0.536+0.536+2.277+3.684)=5.961 -> 1.49025\n        hour16: (-1.474, 0.603, 2.076, 2.545) -> (-1.474+0.603+2.076+2.545)=3.75 -> 0.9375\n        hour17: (0.000, 0.938, 1.407, 1.608) -> (0.000+0.938+1.407+1.608)=3.953 -> 0.98825\n        hour18: (-0.201, 0.067, 0.335, 0.536) -> (-0.201+0.067+0.335+0.536)=0.737 -> 0.18425\n        hour19: (-0.268, 0.268, 1.005, 1.340) -> (-0.268+0.268+1.005+1.340)=2.345 -> 0.58625\n        hour20: (-0.335, 0.134, 0.737, 1.273) -> (-0.335+0.134+0.737+1.273)=1.809 -> 0.45225\n        hour21: (-0.335, -0.067, 0.201, 0.938) -> (-0.335-0.067+0.201+0.938)=0.737 -> 0.18425\n        hour22: (0.536, 1.139, 1.808, 3.215) -> (0.536+1.139+1.808+3.215)=6.698 -> 1.6745\n        hour23: (0.000, 1.942, 1.875, 3.952) -> (0.000+1.942+1.875+3.952)=7.769 -> 1.94225\n\n 40. Now, the next 96 hours (from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-10-08): \n            00:00:00 -> 1.45675\n            01:00:00 -> 1.5405\n            02:00:00 -> 1.189\n            03:00:00 -> 1.373\n            04:00:00 -> 1.038\n            05:00:00 -> 0.61975\n            06:00:00 -> 1.05475\n            07:00:00 -> 1.6745\n            08:00:00 -> 1.69125\n            09:00:00 -> 1.67475\n            10:00:00 -> 3.215\n            11:00:00 -> 2.5285\n            12:00:00 -> 2.81325\n            13:00:00 -> 2.57875\n            14:00:00 -> 1.77475\n            15:00:00 -> 1.49025\n            16:00:00 -> 0.9375\n            17:00:00 -> 0.98825\n            18:00:00 -> 0.18425\n            19:00:00 -> 0.58625\n            20:00:00 -> 0.45225\n            21:00:00 -> 0.18425\n            22:00:00 -> 1.6745\n            23:00:00 -> 1.94225\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 numbers for the next 3 days.\n\n 41. But note: the next day is Sunday, and we are using the average of Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat. This might not be accurate, but we have no other data.\n\n 42. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 43. We must format the dates correctly: \n        \"2017-10-08 00:00:00\", \"2017-10-08 01:00:00\", ... until \"2017-10-11 23:00:00\"\n\n 44. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps and the corresponding HULL value (the average for that hour, repeated for 4 days).\n\n 45. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 46. However, note: the input has negative values and up to 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. We'll write the averages rounded to 3 decimal places.\n\n 48. But note: the average for hour0: 1.45675 -> 1.457? \n        The input has 1.340, 0.536, 2.076, 1.875 -> average is 1.45675 -> we can round to 1.457.\n\n 49. However, the problem does not to omit any content, so we must provide the full 96 points.\n\n 50. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 51. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\" in the context of the past data?\n        We are not missing in the provided 96, so we are safe.\n\n 52. We output the data.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must output 96 rows.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n But wait: the last provided date is 2017-10-07 23:00:00. The next 96 should start at 2017-10-08 00:00:00 and go to 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n\n We have 4 days * 24 = 96.\n\n We'll generate:\n\n        date                 HULL\n        2017-10-08 00:00:00  1.457\n        2017-10-08 01:00:00  1.541\n        2017-10-08 02:00:00  1.189\n        2017-10-08 03:00:00  1.373\n        2017-10-08 04:00:00  1.038\n        2017-10-08 05:00:00  0.620\n        2017-10-08 06:00:00  1.055\n        2017-10-08 07:00:00  1.675\n        2017-10-08 08:00:00  1.691\n        2017-10-08 09:00:00  1.675\n        2017-10-08 10:00:00  3.215\n        2017-10-08 11:00:00  2.529\n        2017-10-08 12:00:00  2.813\n        2017-10-08 13:00:00  2.579\n        2017-10-08 14:00:00  1.775\n        2017-10-08 15:00:00  1.490\n        2017-10-08 16:00:00  0.938\n        2017-10-08 17:00:00  0.988\n        2017-10-08 18:00:00  0.184\n        2017-10-08 19:00:00  0.586\n        2017-10-08 20:00:00  0.452\n        2017-10-08 21:00:00  0.184\n        2017-10-08 22:00:00  1.675\n        2017-10-08 23:00:00  1.942\n\n        Then the next day (2017-10-09) same pattern: same 24 numbers.\n\n        And so on for 4 days.\n\n 53. We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n 54. But note: the rounding:\n\n        hour0: 1.45675 -> 1.457\n        hour1: 1.5405 -> 1.541\n        hour2: 1.189 -> 1.189\n        hour3: 1.373 -> 1.373\n        hour4: 1.038 -> 1.038\n        hour5: 0.61975 -> 0.620\n        hour6: 1.05475 -> 1.055\n        hour7: 1.6745 -> 1.675\n        hour8: 1.69125 -> 1.691\n        hour9: 1.67475 -> 1.675\n        hour10: 3.215 -> 3.215\n        hour11: 2.5285 -> 2.529\n        hour12: 2.81325 -> 2.813\n        hour13: 2.57875 -> 2.579\n        hour14: 1.77475 -> 1.775\n        hour15: 1.49025 -> 1.490\n        hour16: 0.9375 -> 0.938\n        hour17: 0.98825 -> 0.988\n        hour18: 0.18425 -> 0.184\n        hour19: 0.58625 -> 0.586\n        hour20: 0.45225 -> 0.452\n        hour21: 0.18425 -> 0.184\n        hour22: 1.6745 -> 1.675\n        hour23: 1.94225 -> 1.942\n\n 55. Now, we write the next 96 points by repeating these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 56. We must be cautious: the dates must be consecutive and in hourly frequency.\n\n 57. We generate:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-08 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-10-09 00:00:00 to 2017-10-09 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-10-10 00:00:00 to 2017-10-10 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-10-11 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00\n\n 58. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 59. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 60. We write the answer in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-08 00:00:00  1.457\n2017-10-08 01:00:00  1.541\n2017-10-08 02:00:00  1.189\n... (until 96 lines)\n```\n\n 61. We do it.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"the dataset ... is subdivided into four mini-datasets, with data sampled either hourly or every 15 minutes.\" \n        This one is hourly, so we are good.\n\n 62. We output.\n",
