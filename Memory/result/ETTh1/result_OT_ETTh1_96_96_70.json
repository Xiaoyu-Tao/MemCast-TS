        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-04-07 00:00:00 to 2017-04-10 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? \n    But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be cautious. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We can use a time series forecasting model. Given the data length (only 96 points) and the frequency (hourly), \n    we might consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple moving average. However, note that the data shows:\n      - Daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours) but also some non-stationary behavior and possible external effects.\n\n 4. Given the data, we observe:\n      - The temperature drops significantly during the night and rises during the day, but with some anomalies (e.g., 2017-04-08 21:00:00 drops to 8.864, then 7.457, etc.)\n\n 5. We must handle the data as having a seasonal pattern of 24 hours (since we have hourly data and daily cycles).\n\n 6. We can use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) with seasonality.\n\n 7. However, note that we are only given 96 points (4 days) to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). This is a very short history.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n      - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and then forecast each component.\n      - But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? \n    However, we see that the pattern is not exactly the same each day. For example, the temperature on 2017-04-10 is generally lower than the previous days.\n\n10. Given the complexity and the short history, we might use a naive seasonal method: \n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 available days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days?\n    But note: the data shows a downward trend? Let's check:\n\n      Day 1 (04-07): min ~9.778, max ~14.914\n      Day 2 (04-08): min ~7.246, max ~16.883\n      Day 3 (04-09): min ~3.588, max ~9.145\n      Day 4 (04-10): min ~2.110, max ~10.622\n\n    There is a clear downward trend. So we cannot just use the average without adjusting for trend.\n\n11. We can try to model the trend and then the seasonality. But with only 4 days, we can fit a linear trend and then remove it, then model the seasonality.\n\n12. Steps for a simple model:\n    a) Fit a linear regression to the entire series to capture the downward trend.\n    b) Subtract the trend to get the detrended series.\n    c) Compute the seasonal component by averaging the detrended values for each hour (0-23) over the 4 days.\n    d) Forecast the trend for the next 96 hours and then add the seasonal component.\n\n13. However, note that the trend might not be linear and the seasonality might change. Also, the last day (04-10) is much colder.\n\n14. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with additive seasonality and trend. But with only 4 days, the seasonality period (24) is too long relative to the data.\n\n15. Given the constraints, we will use a simple method: \n    - We'll compute the average of each hour of the day (0-23) from the 4 days, and then adjust by the overall trend of the last day? \n    But note: the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any.\n\n16. Since the problem requires the next 96 points, we can see that the data ends at 2017-04-10 23:00:00. The next 96 hours will be from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00.\n\n17. We decide to use a moving average of the same hour for the last 4 days, but with a drift (trend) component. \n\n    Let y(t) be the value at hour h (0-23) of day d.\n\n    We can model: \n        y(d, h) = base(h) + slope * (d - d0) \n    and then forecast.\n\n    However, we have only 4 days. We can set d0 as the first day (2017-04-07). Then we have 4 points for each hour? \n\n    But note: the trend might not be linear and the data is short.\n\n18. Another idea: use the last day (2017-04-10) as the base and then add the average daily seasonal pattern (computed as the difference from the daily mean for each hour) from the previous days? \n\n    Steps:\n      a) For each day, compute the daily mean.\n      b) For each hour in a day, compute the deviation from the daily mean for that day.\n      c) Average these deviations for each hour across the 4 days to get the average hourly deviation.\n      d) For the next 4 days, we need to forecast the daily mean. We can use a trend on the daily means.\n\n    How to forecast the daily mean for the next 4 days?\n        We have 4 daily means: \n          04-07: mean1\n          04-08: mean2\n          04-09: mean3\n          04-10: mean4\n\n        We can fit a linear regression: mean = a + b * day_index (0,1,2,3) and then forecast for day_index 4,5,6,7.\n\n    Then for a future day d (with day_index = 4, d5, d6, d7) and hour h, the forecast is:\n        forecast(d, h) = forecast_daily_mean(d) + average_hourly_deviation(h)\n\n19. Let's compute:\n\n    Step 1: Compute daily means for the 4 days.\n\n    Day 1 (2017-04-07): \n        mean1 = (12.029+11.748+...+13.999)/24 -> we have 24 points? Actually, 00:00 to 23:00 -> 24 hours.\n\n        We have 24 points for each day? Yes, 96 points / 4 = 24 per day.\n\n    Let me compute the daily means:\n\n        Day1 (04-07): \n            sum = 12.029+11.748+12.240+9.778+12.733+11.818+10.974+11.678+13.014+12.522+13.788+12.592+12.733+14.140+14.069+14.140+14.069+14.914+14.210+14.703+14.843+14.210+14.351+13.999\n            = 302.305 / 24 = 12.596\n\n        Day2 (04-08):\n            sum = 14.703+14.280+14.562+15.406+13.507+12.451+12.803+12.381+12.733+14.421+14.069+14.210+14.351+14.773+15.898+16.882999+16.672001+16.250+15.406+13.718+12.944+8.864+7.457+7.246\n            = 309.184 / 24 = 12.8827\n\n        Day3 (04-09):\n            sum = 6.261+6.331+6.261+7.809+7.105+7.527+7.457+7.527+7.457+8.371+8.934+9.004+8.793+8.864+9.145+9.004+8.442+8.090+7.738+7.457+7.175+6.753+3.588+4.150\n            = 170.286 / 24 = 7.09525\n\n        Day4 (04-10):\n            sum = 4.854+5.346+6.331+3.517+5.417+6.613+6.894+6.331+7.105+7.035+7.527+9.215+9.145+10.130+8.160+4.362+3.869+2.532+2.110+4.713+6.120+8.020+8.653\n            Wait, I see only 23 points?

Actually, the 13:00 is 10.622. So let me add:\n\n                = 4.854+5.346+6.331+3.517+5.417+6.613+6.894+6.331+7.105+7.035+7.527+9.215+9.145+10.622+10.130+8.160+4.362+3.869+2.532+2.110+4.713+6.120+8.020+8.653\n                = 148.221 / 24 = 6.175875\n\n    So daily means:\n        day0: 2017-04-07 -> 12.596\n        day1: 2017-04-08 -> 12.8827\n        day2: 2017-04-09 -> 7.09525\n        day3: 2017-04-10 -> 6.175875\n\n    Step 2: Compute the hourly deviations for each day:\n\n        For each hour h (0..23) in day d, deviation = OT(d, h) - mean(d)\n\n    Step 3: Average the deviations for each hour over the 4 days to get the average deviation for that hour.\n\n    Step 4: Forecast the daily mean for the next 4 days (2017-04-11, 2017-04-12, 2017-04-13, 2017-04-14) using a linear trend.\n\n        Let x = [0,1,2,3] for the 4/7,4/8,4/9,4/10\n        y = [12.596, 12.8827, 7.09525, 6.175875]\n\n        We fit a linear regression: y = a + b*x\n\n        We can use least squares:\n\n            n = 4\n            sum_x = 0+1+2+3 = 6\n            sum_y = 12.596+12.8827+7.09525+6.175875 = 38.749825\n            sum_xy = 0*12.596 + 1*12.8827 + 2*7.09525 + 3*6.175875 = 0 + 12.8827 + 14.1905 + 18.527625 = 45.600825\n            sum_x2 = 0+1+4+9 = 14\n\n            b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n              = (4*45.600825 - 6*38.749825) / (4*14 - 36)\n              = (182.4033 - 232.49895) / (56-36)\n              = (-50.09565) / 20 = -2.5047825\n\n            a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (38.749825 - (-2.5047825)*6) / 4 = (38.749825 + 15.028695) / 4 = 53.77852 / 4 = 13.44463\n\n        So the model: mean(x) = 13.44463 - 2.5047825 * x\n\n        For the next days:\n            day4 (2017-04-11): x=4 -> mean = 13.44463 - 2.5047825*4 = 13.44463 - 10.01913 = 3.4255\n            day5 (2017-04-12): x=5 -> mean = 13.44463 - 2.5047825*5 = 13.44463 - 12.5239125 = 0.9207175\n            day6 (2017-04-13): x=6 -> mean = 13.44463 - 2.5047825*6 = 13.44463 - 15.028695 = -1.584065\n            day7 (2017-04-14): x=7 -> mean = 13.44463 - 2.5047825*7 = 13.44463 - 17.5334775 = -4.0888475\n\n        But negative temperatures? That might be possible? But looking at the data, the minimum was 2.110. However, the trend is downward and the last day was 6.17, so the next day might be even lower? But negative? \n\n        Alternatively, we might consider that the trend might not continue linearly? But we have only 4 points and the last two days are much lower.\n\n        However, we see that the drop from day0 to day1 was small, then a big drop to day2 and then a drop to day3. The linear trend might be too aggressive.\n\n        Alternatively, we could use the average of the last two days? Or use exponential smoothing? \n\n        But the problem requires 96 points, so we must produce a method.\n\n        We'll stick to the linear trend for now, but note that if we get negative, we might cap at a minimum? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last two days for the daily mean? \n\n        Since the last two days are 7.095 and 6.175, we can average them: (7.095+6.175)/2 = 6.635, and then for the next 4 days, we can use:\n\n            day4: 6.175 - (7.095-6.175) = 6.175 - 0.92 = 5.255? \n            This is a naive method: using the last change.\n\n        But we have to be consistent. We'll use the linear regression as above, but then if the forecasted mean is negative, we set to a minimum? \n\n        However, note that the data on 2017-04-10 had a minimum of 2.110, so we might allow negative? But the problem is about oil temperature, which might not go below a certain point? \n\n        Since we don't have domain knowledge, we'll let the linear regression as is.\n\n    Step 5: For each day in the next 4 days and for each hour (0-23), the forecast is:\n        forecast(day, hour) = forecast_daily_mean(day) + average_deviation(hour)\n\n    Step 6: Compute the average deviation for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the deviations for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n            day0: 12.029 - 12.596 = -0.567\n            day1: 14.703 - 12.8827 = 1.8203\n            day2: 6.261 - 7.09525 = -0.83425\n            day3: 4.854 - 6.175875 = -1.321875\n            average = (-0.567 + 1.8203 -0.83425 -1.321875)/4 = (-0.902825)/4 = -0.22570625\n\n        Similarly for all hours.\n\n    Step 7: Then for 2017-04-11 00:00:00: \n        forecast = 3.4255 + (-0.22570625) = 3.19979375\n\n    And so on.\n\n20. However, note that the linear trend forecasted daily means are decreasing and even negative. This might lead to negative temperatures. We'll proceed and then if we get negative, we output as is? \n\n21. Alternatively, we can use a minimum? But the problem does not specify. We'll output the negative if the model says so.\n\n22. Implementation:\n\n    We'll compute the average deviation for each hour (0-23) from the 4 days.\n\n    Then we'll compute the daily means for the next 4 days using the linear model.\n\n    Then we'll create the next 96 points by:\n\n        For day_index from 4 to 7 (representing 2017-04-11 to 2017-04-14) and for hour 0 to 23:\n\n            date = start of 2017-04-11 00:00:00 and then add (day_index-4)*24 + hour hours.\n\n            value = forecast_daily_mean(day_index) + avg_deviation[hour]\n\n23. Let's code this in Python in our mind.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        # Given data: 96 points, we have split into 4 days of 24 hours.\n\n        # Step 1: Compute daily means for the 4 days (as above: day0=12.596, day1=12.8827, day2=7.09525, day3=6.175875)\n\n        # Step 2: Compute deviations for each hour in each day.\n\n        # Step 3: Average the deviations for each hour (0-23) -> we get a list of 24 values: avg_dev[0..23]\n\n        # Step 4: Fit linear regression for daily means: \n            x = [0,1,2,3]\n            y = [12.596, 12.8827, 7.09525, 6.175875]\n\n            We computed:\n                b = -2.5047825\n                a = 13.44463\n\n        # Step 5: Forecast daily means for x=4,5,6,7:\n            day4: 3.4255\n            day5: 0.9207175\n            day6: -1.584065\n            day7: -4.0888475\n\n        # Step 6: For each day in [4,5,6,7] and hour in [0,23]:\n            value = forecast_daily_mean(day) + avg_dev[hour]\n\n        # Step 7: Generate the dates: \n            Start from 2017-04-11 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-14 23:00:00.\n\n24. But note: the data we are given ends at 2017-04-10 23:00:00. The next date is 2017-04-11 00:00:00.\n\n25. We must compute the average deviations for each hour. We do that by:\n\n        deviations = []\n        for hour in range(24):\n            devs = []\n            for day in range(4):\n                # get the value at (day, hour)\n                index = day*24 + hour\n                value = data[index][1]   # the temperature\n                dev = value - daily_means[day]\n                devs.append(dev)\n            avg_dev = sum(devs) / 4\n            deviations.append(avg_dev)\n\n26. Then we generate the next 96 points:\n\n        next_dates = []\n        next_values = []\n        for day in range(4,8):   # representing the 4 days: 2017-04-11 to 2017-04-14\n            daily_mean_forecast = a + b * day\n            for hour in range(24):\n                # date: starting from 2017-04-11 00:00:00\n                # day0: 2017-04-11 -> day_index=4\n                # day1: 2017-04-12 -> day_index=5\n                # day2: 2017-04-13 -> day_index=6\n                # day3: 2017-04-14 -> day_index=7\n                # The date: \n                #   base_date = datetime(2017,4,11)\n                #   current_date = base_date + timedelta(days=day-4) + timedelta(hours=hour)\n                # But we can generate by: \n                #   total_hours = (day-4)*24 + hour\n                #   start_date = datetime(2017,4,11,0,0,0)\n                #   current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=total_hours)\n\n                # But we can also note: \n                #   The first forecast point: 2017-04-11 00:00:00 -> day=4, hour=0\n                #   Then 2017-04-11 01:00:00 -> day=4, hour=1\n                #   ... until 2017-04-11 23:00:00 -> day=4, hour=23\n                #   Then 2017-04-12 00:00:00 -> day=5, hour=0\n\n                value = daily_mean_forecast + deviations[hour]\n                # Format the date: \n                #   We know the next day after 2017-04-10 is 2017-04-11.\n                #   So for day_index=4: 2017-04-11, then 2017-04-12 for day_index=5, etc.\n\n                # We'll create the date string: \n                #   day_index 4 -> 2017-04-11\n                #   day_index 5 -> 2017-04-12\n                #   day_index 6 -> 2017-04-13\n                #   day_index 7 -> 2017-04-14\n\n                date_str = f\"2017-04-{11+day-4} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n                # But note: April has 30 days, so 11,12,13,14 are all in April.\n\n                next_dates.append(date_str)\n                next_values.append(value)\n\n27. However, note the date format: \n        The input format: \"2017-04-07 00:00:00\"\n\n    We must output in the same format.\n\n28. But wait: the day part: \n        For day=4: 2017-04-11 -> 11\n        day=5: 2017-04-12 -> 12\n        day=6: 2017-04-13 -> 13\n        day=7: 2017-04-14 -> 14\n\n    So we can do: \n        base_day = 11\n        current_day = base_day + (day-4)\n\n        Then: date_str = \"2017-04-\"+str(current_day).zfill(2) + \" \" + str(hour).zfill(2)+\":00:00\"\n\n    But note: the day is two-digit? 11,12,13,14 are two-digit.\n\n29. However, we must be cautious: the month is April (04) and the days are 11,12,13,14 -> no problem.\n\n30. But note: the last day we have is 2017-04-10, so the next day is 2017-04-11.\n\n31. Now, we must compute the deviations for each hour. We'll do that manually? \n\n    We have the data in the problem. We'll compute the deviations for each hour.\n\n    We'll create a table:\n\n        hour0: \n            day0: 12.029 - 12.596 = -0.567\n            day1: 14.703 - 12.8827 = 1.8203\n            day2: 6.261 - 7.09525 = -0.83425\n            day3: 4.854 - 6.175875 = -1.321875\n            avg = (-0.567+1.8203-0.83425-1.321875)/4 = (-0.902825)/4 = -0.22570625\n\n        hour1:\n            day0: 11.748 - 12.596 = -0.848\n            day1: 14.280 - 12.8827 = 1.3973\n            day2: 6.331 - 7.09525 = -0.76425\n            day3: 5.346 - 6.175875 = -0.829875\n            avg = (-0.848+1.3973-0.76425-0.829875)/4 = (-1.044825)/4 = -0.26120625\n\n        hour2: \n            day0: 12.240 - 12.596 = -0.356\n            day1: 14.562 - 12.8827 = 1.6793\n            day2: 6.261 - 7.09525 = -0.83425\n            day3: 6.331 - 6.175875 = 0.155125\n            avg = (-0.356+1.6793-0.83425+0.155125)/4 = (0.644175)/4 = 0.16104375\n\n        ... we need to do for all 24 hours.\n\n    This is tedious. We can write a small program, but since we are not coding, we have to do it by hand? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the fact that the average of the entire daily deviations should be zero? \n\n    We'll do a few and then extrapolate? But we must do all.\n\n    We have to do it. We'll do it step by step.\n\n    We'll create a list for the 4 days of data for each hour.\n\n    We have the data in order:\n\n        Day0: [12.029, 11.748, 12.240, 9.778, 12.733, 11.818, 10.974,
