        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) from 2016-12-20 00:00:00 to 2016-12-23 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, the provided data for the past 96 points is complete? Let's check: \n   - The data starts at 2016-12-20 00:00:00 and ends at 2016-12-23 23:00:00. \n   - There are 24 hours per day and 4 days: 4 * 24 = 96, so it's complete for the given period.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours, which would be from 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n 3. Since the data is hourly and we have 4 days of history, we can consider time series forecasting methods. Given the short history, we might use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or \n    - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) if we can identify seasonality.\n\n 4. Observing the data: \n    - There seems to be daily patterns (24-hour seasonality). For example, the values dip during certain hours (like early morning) and rise at others.\n\n 5. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the future? The problem says the data will have missing values, but note: we are generating the forecast for the next 96 dates. \n    - We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we must fill in any missing values? Actually, the forecast should be for all 96 points without gaps.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    - We will use a model that can handle the seasonality. Since we have hourly data and a daily seasonality (period=24), we can use SARIMA with seasonal period 24.\n    - Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive method, but given the complexity and the need for accuracy, we'll use a model-based approach.\n\n 7. However, note: the data provided is only 96 points (4 days). This is a very short time series for fitting a SARIMA model with daily seasonality (which requires at least 2 seasonal cycles to fit). \n    - We might have to use a simpler model.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can try:\n    - A seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components? But again, 4 days is very short.\n\n 9. Alternative: Use a naive seasonal forecast. For example, the forecast for each hour in the next day is the same as the same hour in the previous day. But we have 4 days of history, so we can average the same hour over the 4 days? \n    - However, the data shows variability and trends? Let's see: \n        The values on 2016-12-20 to 2016-12-23 are not exactly repeating.\n\n 10. We can use the last available day (2016-12-23) as the pattern for the next days? But that might not capture the average pattern.\n\n 11. Given the challenge, we decide to use a simple average by hour of the four days to forecast the next four days? \n     - That is, for hour 00:00:00, we take the average of the 00:00:00 of the four days and use that for the next four days? \n     - But note: the next four days are consecutive and might have a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a weekly trend or longer.\n\n 12. However, the problem does not specify the exact date beyond 2016-12-23, but we know the next 96 hours are from 2016-12-24 to 2016-12-27. \n     - We are in the winter season? The data is from December. \n\n 13. Considering the above, we will use a seasonal naive method with the average of the same hour over the available 4 days.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour from the 4 days we have.\n   - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the average value for the corresponding hour.\n\n Example:\n   - For hour 00:00:00: \n        Day1 (20th): 0.249\n        Day2 (21st): -0.497\n        Day3 (22nd): -1.848\n        Day4 (23rd): -0.142\n        Average = (0.249 -0.497 -1.848 -0.142) / 4 = (-2.238) / 4 = -0.5595\n\n   - Then, for 2016-12-24 00:00:00: -0.5595\n        and similarly for 2016-12-25 00:00:00, 2016-12-26 00:00:00, 2016-12-27 00:00:00: all the same? \n\n 14. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are generating the forecast, so we are not actually given the future data. We are to produce the entire 96 points without missing values.\n\n 15. However, this method would produce the same pattern repeated for each day? That is, the same 24 values repeated 4 times? \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the four days and then use that as the daily pattern and repeat it for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (0.249, -0.497, -1.848, -0.142) -> average = (0.249 -0.497 -1.848 -0.142)/4 = (-2.238)/4 = -0.5595\n        hour1: (-0.036, -0.213, -1.492, 0.959) -> (-0.036 -0.213 -1.492 +0.959) = (-0.782) /4 = -0.1955\n        ... and so on.\n\n 18. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same 24 averaged values repeated 4 times.\n\n 19. However, we note that the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We might consider a linear trend? But the data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days? \n\n 20. Let's check the overall average per day:\n        Day1 (20th): average of 24 hours = ?\n        Day2 (21st): ?\n        Day3 (22nd): ?\n        Day4 (23rd): ?\n\n    We can compute the daily mean to see if there's a trend:\n\n        Day1: \n            values: [0.249, -0.036, -0.320, -0.640, -0.036, -1.315, -1.599, -1.635, -1.173, -1.315, -1.528, -1.564, -2.097, -1.421, -1.137, -1.990, -1.919, -2.559, -2.168, -2.097, -1.777, -2.701, -1.031, -1.990]\n            mean = -1.42 (approx)\n\n        Day2: \n            [-0.497, -0.213, -0.782, -0.426, -0.213, -1.102, -1.848, -1.919, -1.173, -2.239, -2.025, -2.025, -1.777, -2.381, -2.274, -2.452, -1.848, -2.097, -1.990, -1.990, -2.203, -2.487, -1.954, -2.452]\n            mean = -1.77 (approx)\n\n        Day3:\n            [-1.848, -1.492, -1.919, -1.777, -2.168, -0.782, -1.990, -1.208, -0.888, -1.386, -1.173, -1.528, -1.492, -0.604, -0.355, -1.031, -1.279, -1.528, -1.279, -1.386, -1.528, -3.020, -0.675, 0.391]\n            mean = -1.30 (approx)\n\n        Day4:\n            [-0.142, 0.959, -0.355, 0.497, 0.533, -0.178, -0.497, 0.071, -0.071, -1.670, -1.208, -0.497, -1.386, -0.817, -1.386, -1.386, -1.350, -1.741, -2.381, -1.919, -2.025, -2.132, -0.178, -0.249]\n            mean = -0.80 (approx)\n\n    The daily means: -1.42, -1.77, -1.30, -0.80 -> not a clear trend? It went down then up? \n\n 21. Given the complexity and the short history, we stick to the average by hour without a trend.\n\n 22. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 23. Steps to compute:\n\n        hour0: (2016-12-20 00:00:00, 2016-12-21 00:00:00, 2016-12-22 00:00:00, 2016-12-23 00:00:00) -> (0.249, -0.497, -1.848, -0.142) -> avg = (0.249 -0.497 -1.848 -0.142)/4 = -2.238/4 = -0.5595\n        hour1: (-0.036, -0.213, -1.492, 0.959) -> (-0.036 -0.213 -1.492 +0.959) = -0.782 -> -0.1955\n        hour2: (-0.320, -0.782, -1.919, -0.355) -> (-0.320 -0.782 -1.919 -0.355) = -3.376 -> -0.844\n        hour3: (-0.640, -0.426, -1.777, 0.497) -> (-0.640 -0.426 -1.777 +0.497) = -2.346 -> -0.5865\n        hour4: (-0.036, -0.213, -2.168, 0.533) -> (-0.036 -0.213 -2.168 +0.533) = -1.884 -> -0.471\n        hour5: (-1.315, -1.102, -0.782, -0.178) -> (-1.315 -1.102 -0.782 -0.178) = -3.377 -> -0.84425\n        hour6: (-1.599, -1.848, -1.990, -0.497) -> (-1.599 -1.848 -1.990 -0.497) = -5.934 -> -1.4835\n        hour7: (-1.635, -1.919, -1.208, 0.071) -> (-1.635 -1.919 -1.208 +0.071) = -4.691 -> -1.17275\n        hour8: (-1.173, -1.173, -0.888, -0.071) -> (-1.173 -1.173 -0.888 -0.071) = -3.305 -> -0.82625\n        hour9: (-1.315, -2.239, -1.386, -1.670) -> (-1.315 -2.239 -1.386 -1.670) = -6.61 -> -1.6525\n        hour10: (-1.528, -2.025, -1.173, -1.208) -> (-1.528 -2.025 -1.173 -1.208) = -5.934 -> -1.4835\n        hour11: (-1.564, -2.025, -1.528, -0.497) -> (-1.564 -2.025 -1.528 -0.497) = -5.614 -> -1.4035\n        hour12: (-2.097, -1.777, -1.492, -1.386) -> (-2.097 -1.777 -1.492 -1.386) = -6.752 -> -1.688\n        hour13: (-1.421, -2.381, -0.604, -0.817) -> (-1.421 -2.381 -0.604 -0.817) = -5.223 -> -1.30575\n        hour14: (-1.137, -2.274, -0.355, -1.386) -> (-1.137 -2.274 -0.355 -1.386) = -5.152 -> -1.288\n        hour15: (-1.990, -2.452, -1.031, -1.386) -> (-1.990 -2.452 -1.031 -1.386) = -6.859 -> -1.71475\n        hour16: (-1.919, -1.848, -1.279, -1.350) -> (-1.919 -1.848 -1.279 -1.350) = -6.396 -> -1.599\n        hour17: (-2.559, -2.097, -1.528, -1.741) -> (-2.559 -2.097 -1.528 -1.741) = -7.925 -> -1.98125\n        hour18: (-2.168, -1.990, -1.279, -2.381) -> (-2.168 -1.990 -1.279 -2.381) = -7.818 -> -1.9545\n        hour19: (-2.097, -1.990, -1.386, -1.919) -> (-2.097 -1.990 -1.386 -1.919) = -7.392 -> -1.848\n        hour20: (-1.777, -2.203, -1.528, -2.025) -> (-1.777 -2.203 -1.528 -2.025) = -7.533 -> -1.88325\n        hour21: (-2.701, -2.487, -3.020, -2.132) -> (-2.701 -2.487 -3.020 -2.132) = -10.34 -> -2.585\n        hour22: (-1.031, -1.954, -0.675, -0.178) -> (-1.031 -1.954 -0.675 -0.178) = -3.838 -> -0.9595\n        hour23: (-1.990, -2.452, 0.391, -0.249) -> (-1.990 -2.452 +0.391 -0.249) = -4.3 -> -1.075\n\n 24. Now, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2016-12-24) will be:\n        hour0: -0.5595\n        hour1: -0.1955\n        ... until hour23: -1.075\n\n 25. Then the same pattern for 2016-12-25, 2016-12-26, 2016-12-27.\n\n 26. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are generating the forecast, so we are not missing any point. We are generating 96 points.\n\n 27. We output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 28. We must round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input data has 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. However, note: the input data has negative values and some with 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 30. Let's create the list:\n\n        We have 2016-12-24 00:00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n        For each day in [24,25,26,27] of December 2016, and for each hour in 0 to 23, we assign the average we computed for that hour.\n\n 31. We write the data in the same format.\n\n 32. Example for 2016-12-24 00:00:00: -0.5595 -> rounded to 3 decimals: -0.560\n\n 33. But note: the original data has values like -0.036, which is 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 34. We'll compute the averages again and round:\n\n        hour0: -0.5595 -> -0.560\n        But let's do the calculation: \n            (0.249 -0.497 -1.848 -0.142) = -2.238 -> -2.238/4 = -0.5595 -> round to 3 decimals: -0.560\n\n        hour1: (-0.036 -0.213 -1.492 +0.959) = (-0.036 -0.213 = -0.249; -0.249 -1.492 = -1.741; -1.741+0.959 = -0.782) -> -0.782/4 = -0.1955 -> -0.196\n\n        ... \n\n 35. We'll create a list of the 24 averages (rounded to 3 decimals) and then repeat it 4 times.\n\n 36. The 24 list (rounded):\n\n        hour0: -0.560\n        hour1: -0.196\n        hour2: -0.844\n        hour3: -0.587\n        [Note: -0.5865 -> -0.587? But rounding: \n            -0.5865: \n                The fourth decimal is 5 -> round up: -0.587? \n                However, note: negative numbers: \n                The rule is the same: look at the absolute value: 0.5865 -> round to 3 decimals: 0.587 -> so negative: -0.587.\n        ]\n\n        Let's do the rounding for each:\n\n        We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            hour0: round(-0.5595, 3) -> -0.560\n            hour1: round(-0.1955, 3) -> -0.196\n            hour2: round(-0.844, 3) -> -0.844\n            hour3: round(-0.5865, 3) -> -0.587\n            hour4: round(-0.471, 3) -> -0.471\n            hour5: round(-0.84425, 3) -> -0.844\n            hour6: round(-1.4835, 3) -> -1.484\n            hour7: round(-1.17275, 3) -> -1.173\n            hour8: round(-0.82625, 3) -> -0.826\n            hour9: round(-1.6525, 3) -> -1.653\n            hour10: round(-1.4835, 3) -> -1.484\n            hour11: round(-1.4035, 3) -> -1.404\n            hour12: round(-1.688, 3) -> -1.688\n            hour13: round(-1.30575, 3) -> -1.306\n            hour14: round(-1.288, 3) -> -1.288\n            hour15: round(-1.71475, 3) -> -1.715\n            hour16: round(-1.599, 3) -> -1.599\n            hour17: round(-1.98125, 3) -> -1.981\n            hour18: round(-1.9545, 3) -> -1.955\n            hour19: round(-1.848, 3) -> -1.848\n            hour20: round(-1.88325, 3) -> -1.883\n            hour21: round(-2.585, 3) -> -2.585\n            hour22: round(-0.9595, 3) -> -0.960\n            hour23: round(-1.075, 3) -> -1.075   [Note: -1.075 is already 3 decimals? Actually, the original had 3 decimals. But our calculation: \n        (-1.990 -2.452 +0.391 -0.249) = -4.3 -> -4.3/4 = -1.075 -> so -1.075]\n\n 37. Now, we create the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2016-12-24\n            hour0: -0.560\n            hour1: -0.196\n            ... until hour23: -1.075\n\n        Day2: 2016-12-25: same 24 numbers\n        Day3: 2016-12-26: same\n        Day4: 2016-12-27: same\n\n 38. We output the data in the same format as the input, with the date increasing hourly.\n\n 39. We must generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-24 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-12-24 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-12-27 23:00:00.\n\n 40. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-24 00:00:00 -0.560\n2016-12-24 01:00:00 -0.196\n2016-12-24 02:00:00 -0.844\n2016-12-24 03:00:00 -0.587\n2016-12-24 04:00:00 -0.471\n2016-12-24 05:00:00 -0.844\n2016-12-24 06:00:00 -1.484\n2016-12-24 07:00:00 -1.173\n2016-12-24 08:00:00 -0.826\n2016-12-24 09:00:00 -1.653\n2016-12-24 10:00:00 -1.484\n2016-12-24 11:00:00 -1.404\n2016-12-24 12:00:00 -1.688\n2016-12-24 13:00:00 -1.306\n2016-12-24 14:00:00 -1.288\n2016-12-24 15:00:00 -1.715\n2016-12-24 16:00:00 -1.599\n2016-12-24 17:00:00 -1.981\n2016-12-24 18:00:00 -1.955\n2016-12-24 19:00:00 -1.848\n2016-12-24 20:00:00 -1.883\n2016-12-24 21:00:00 -2.585\n2016-12-24 22:00:00 -0.960\n2016-12-24 23:00:00 -1.075\n2016-12-25 00:00:00 -0.560\n2016-12-25 01:00:00 -0.196\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 41. We'll generate the entire 96 lines.\n\n 42. Note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 43. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 44. However, note: the original data had a header: \"date   MULL\", but the output format in the example did not include the header? The input example started with the data. The output should be only the data lines? \n\n 45. The example input was:\n\n               date   MULL\n        2016-12-20 00:00:00  0.249\n        ...\n\n    But the output should be just the data lines? The problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning the same format as the input data without the header? \n\n    The example output format in the problem statement does not show the header. So we output without header.\n\n 46. We output 96 lines of data.\n\n 47. Let's code the 24 values:\n\n        hourly_avg = [\n            -0.560, -0.196, -0.844, -0.587, -0.471, -0.844, -1.484, -1.173,\n            -0.826, -1.653, -1.484, -1.404, -1.688, -1.306, -1.288, -1.715,\n            -1.599, -1.981, -1.955, -1.848, -1.883, -2.585, -0.960, -1.075\n        ]\n\n 48. Then for each day in [24,25,26,27] of December 2016, we assign these 24 times.\n\n 49. We generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta? \n        But we are not coding, we are writing the data.\n\n        We know:\n            Start: 2016-12-24 00:00:00\n            Then 2016-12-24 01:00:00, ... 2016-12-24 23:00:00\n            Then 2016-12-25 00:00:00 ... 2016-12-25 23:00:00\n            Then 2016-12-26 ... \n            Then 2016-12-27 ... until 23:00:00.\n\n 50. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 51. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-24 00:00:00 -0.560\n2016-12-24 01:00:00 -0.196\n2016-12-24 02:00:00 -0.844\n... (until 2016-12-27 23:00:00)\n```\n\n 52. We must be careful: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 53. We'll generate:\n\n        dates = []\n        start_date = \"2016-12-24\"\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"{start_date} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                # but we need to increment the day\n                # actually, we'll generate the date by adding days.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            Day0: 2016-12-24\n            Day1: 2016-12-25\n            Day2: 2016-12-26\n            Day3: 2016-12-27\n\n        For day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            day_str = (24 + day_offset) -> but December has 31 days, so 24,25,26,27 are valid.\n\n        So:\n\n            for day_offset in range(4):\n                day = 24 + day_offset\n                for hour in range(24):\n                    date = f\"2016-12-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n        But note: the day must be two digits: 24,25,26,27 -> so we can write as is.\n\n 54. However, we can also note that the last given date was 2016-12-23 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-12-24 00:00:00.\n\n 55. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 56. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 57. We note: the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\", so we output all 96.\n\n 58. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 59. Let's write the first few:\n\n        2016-12-24 00:00:00 -0.560\n        2016-12-24 01:00:00 -0.196\n        2016-12-24 02:00:00 -0.844\n        2016-12-24 03:00:00 -0.587\n        2016-12-24 04:00:00 -0.471\n        2016-12-24 05:00:00 -0.844\n        2016-12-24 06:00:00 -1.484\n        2016-12-24 07:00:00 -1.173\n        2016-12-24 08:00:00 -0.826\n        2016-12-24 09:00:00 -1.653\n        2016-12-24 10:00:00 -1.484\n        2016-12-24 11:00:00 -1.404\n        2016-12-24 12:00:00 -1.688\n        2016-12-24 13:00:00 -1.306\n        2016-12-24 14:00:00 -1.288\n        2016-12-24 15:00:00 -1.715\n        2016-12-24 16:00:00 -1.599\n        2016-12-24 17:00:00 -1.981\n        2016-12-24 18:00:00 -1.955\n        2016-12-24 19:00:00 -1.848\n        2016-12-24 20:00:00 -1.883\n        2016-12-24 21:00:00 -2.585\n        2016-12-24 22:00:00 -0.960\n        2016-12-24 23:00:00 -1.075\n\n        Then 2016-12-25 00:00:00: -0.560\n        and so on.\n\n 60. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 61. We note: the last line will be 2016-12-27 23:00:00: -1.075\n\n 62. We output in the <answer> block.\n\n 63. Since the problem requires the complete data and we are not missing any, we are done.\n\n 64. However, note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without missing values. So we are providing the complete forecast.\n\n 65. This method is simple and based on the average of the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n 66. We assume that the pattern is stable and there are no major changes.\n\n 67. If we had more data, we could use a more sophisticated model, but with 4 days, this is reasonable.\n\n 68. We output the data.\n",
