        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we have to use the given 96 points to build a time series model.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead (which is 4 days), we can consider a model that captures daily seasonality. The seasonality period is 24.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the need for automation, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data is only 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 96 points (next 4 days). This is a very short history for a seasonal model with 24 periods. But we have to do with what we have.\n\n 5. We'll use an automated approach to select the best model parameters. But note: without more data, the forecast might be a simple extrapolation of the recent pattern.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour in the past days? But we only have 4 days of history.\n\n 7. Given the constraints, I propose to use a seasonal naive method: the forecast for each hour in the next day is the same as the same hour in the last available day (i.e., day 4). But we have 4 days of history. We can also consider averaging the same hour over the 4 days? However, the pattern might change.\n\n 8. But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern. For example, the values are more negative during the day (especially in the afternoon) and less negative or positive at night.\n\n 9. We can try to use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the trend and seasonality.\n\n 10. However, due to the limited data, we will use a simple method: the forecast for the next 96 hours will be the same as the last 96 hours? That doesn't make sense because we are forecasting the next 4 days and we have the past 4 days. But note: the last 96 hours are from 2017-03-10 to 2017-03-13. The next 96 hours are from 2017-03-14 to 2017-03-17. We don't know if there is a weekly pattern? But we don't have weekly data (only 4 days, not a full week).\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the past 4 days. For example, the forecast for 2017-03-14 00:00:00 would be the average of the values at 00:00:00 on 2017-03-10, 2017-03-11, 2017-03-12, and 2017-03-13.\n\n 12. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00): \n        Day1: 0.497, Day2: -0.213, Day3: 0.569, Day4: 0.036 -> average = (0.497 -0.213 + 0.569 + 0.036)/4 = (0.889)/4 = 0.22225\n\n     Similarly for hour 1 (01:00): \n        Day1: 0.675, Day2: 0.071, Day3: 0.391, Day4: -0.284 -> average = (0.675+0.071+0.391-0.284)/4 = 0.853/4 = 0.21325\n\n     And so on.\n\n 13. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough to model a trend. Also, the last day (2017-03-13) might be more representative? We could use only the last day? But the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the given 96 points we don't have any.\n\n 14. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we'll use the average by hour of the four days.\n\n 15. However, let's check the data: the four days are from Friday (2017-03-10) to Monday (2017-03-13). The next four days would be Tuesday (2017-03-14) to Friday (2017-03-17). There might be a weekly pattern? But we don't have data for weekly.\n\n 16. Given the ambiguity, we'll stick to the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n 17. Steps for the forecast:\n      - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour across the 4 days we have.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will assign:\n          Day 5 (2017-03-14): the average for hour 0 to 23 (using the computed averages)\n          Day 6 (2017-03-15): same as Day 5? But we don't have more. Actually, we are using the same set of averages for each day in the forecast.\n\n 18. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not encountered in the given 96, but for the forecast we are generating, we are not going to have missing values because we are computing the average.\n\n 19. However, if we want to be more sophisticated, we could use a model that can capture a trend. But with 4 days, it's hard.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use ExponentialSmoothing from statsmodels, but with such a short series, it might not be stable.\n\n 21. Considering the above, I choose the simple method: for each hour in the day, we take the average of the 4 days.\n\n 22. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n     We'll create a list of 24 values, each being the average of the 4 observations for that hour.\n\n 23. The data:\n\n     Hour 0: [0.497, -0.213, 0.569, 0.036] -> (0.497 -0.213 + 0.569 + 0.036) / 4 = (0.889) / 4 = 0.22225\n     Hour 1: [0.675, 0.071, 0.391, -0.284] -> (0.675+0.071+0.391-0.284) = 0.853 -> 0.21325\n     Hour 2: [0.888, 0.249, -1.386, 0.320] -> (0.888+0.249-1.386+0.320)=0.071 -> 0.01775\n     Hour 3: [0.426, -0.036, -0.355, -0.107] -> (0.426-0.036-0.355-0.107)= -0.072 -> -0.018\n     Hour 4: [0.178, 0.107, -0.711, 0.142] -> (0.178+0.107-0.711+0.142)= -0.284 -> -0.071\n     Hour 5: [0.604, -0.533, -1.883, 0.497] -> (0.604-0.533-1.883+0.497)= -1.315 -> -0.32875\n     Hour 6: [0.071, -0.071, -0.462, -0.604] -> (0.071-0.071-0.462-0.604)= -1.066 -> -0.2665\n     Hour 7: [0.284, -0.249, 0.249, -1.031] -> (0.284-0.249+0.249-1.031)= -0.747 -> -0.18675\n     Hour 8: [0.853, -0.213, 1.457, -0.462] -> (0.853-0.213+1.457-0.462)= 1.635 -> 0.40875\n     Hour 9: [-0.213, -0.604, -0.569, -1.670] -> (-0.213-0.604-0.569-1.670)= -3.056 -> -0.764\n     Hour 10: [-0.959, 0.142, -1.315, -0.817] -> (-0.959+0.142-1.315-0.817)= -2.949 -> -0.73725\n     Hour 11: [-0.782, 0.391, -1.706, -1.564] -> (-0.782+0.391-1.706-1.564)= -3.661 -> -0.91525\n     Hour 12: [-1.777, -1.173, -2.097, -2.132] -> (-1.777-1.173-2.097-2.132)= -7.179 -> -1.79475\n     Hour 13: [-0.924, 0.213, -1.919, -1.421] -> (-0.924+0.213-1.919-1.421)= -4.051 -> -1.01275\n     Hour 14: [-1.457, -0.036, -1.102, -1.492] -> (-1.457-0.036-1.102-1.492)= -4.087 -> -1.02175\n     Hour 15: [-1.457, -0.711, -1.492, -1.883] -> (-1.457-0.711-1.492-1.883)= -5.543 -> -1.38575\n     Hour 16: [-1.492, -1.279, -1.492, -2.239] -> (-1.492-1.279-1.492-2.239)= -6.502 -> -1.6255\n     Hour 17: [-1.635, -1.528, -2.025, -2.132] -> (-1.635-1.528-2.025-2.132)= -7.32 -> -1.83\n     Hour 18: [-2.274, -2.239, -2.310, -2.665] -> (-2.274-2.239-2.310-2.665)= -9.488 -> -2.372\n     Hour 19: [-2.239, -2.345, -2.452, -2.132] -> (-2.239-2.345-2.452-2.132)= -9.168 -> -2.292\n     Hour 20: [-2.416, -2.203, -2.523, -2.168] -> (-2.416-2.203-2.523-2.168)= -9.31 -> -2.3275\n     Hour 21: [-1.954, -2.452, -3.127, -2.878] -> (-1.954-2.452-3.127-2.878)= -10.411 -> -2.60275\n     Hour 22: [-1.386, -0.853, -1.883, -2.097] -> (-1.386-0.853-1.883-2.097)= -6.219 -> -1.55475\n     Hour 23: [-0.391, -0.711, -0.142, -0.497] -> (-0.391-0.711-0.142-0.497)= -1.741 -> -0.43525\n\n 24. Now, we will create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating these 24 averages for each day.\n\n 25. The dates: \n      Start: 2017-03-14 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2017-03-13 23:00:00)\n      Then 2017-03-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-17 23:00:00.\n\n 26. We must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and MULL) and 96 rows.\n\n 27. Let's generate the dates:\n\n      We have the last date in the input: 2017-03-13 23:00:00.\n      The next date is 2017-03-14 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... until 2017-03-17 23:00:00.\n\n 28. We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours.\n\n 29. The MULL values: \n        Day1 (2017-03-14): [0.22225, 0.21325, 0.01775, ... , -0.43525]\n        Day2 (2017-03-15): same 24 values\n        Day3 (2017-03-16): same\n        Day4 (2017-03-17): same\n\n 30. We'll write the data in the format:\n\n        2017-03-14 00:00:00  0.22225\n        2017-03-14 01:00:00  0.21325\n        ... \n\n 31. However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But we are generating the forecast without missing values.\n\n 32. We are providing the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates.\n\n 33. Let's code the output.\n\n 34. But note: the original data has values with 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimal places? The averages we computed with more. We'll round to 3 decimal places to match.\n\n 35. Alternatively, we can output with the same precision. The original data has up to 3 decimal places.\n\n 36. We'll round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 37. Let's recalculate the averages rounded to 3 decimal places:\n\n     Hour 0: 0.222 -> 0.222\n     Hour 1: 0.21325 -> 0.213\n     Hour 2: 0.01775 -> 0.018\n     Hour 3: -0.018 -> -0.018\n     Hour 4: -0.071 -> -0.071\n     Hour 5: -0.32875 -> -0.329\n     Hour 6: -0.2665 -> -0.267\n     Hour 7: -0.18675 -> -0.187\n     Hour 8: 0.40875 -> 0.409\n     Hour 9: -0.764 -> -0.764\n     Hour 10: -0.73725 -> -0.737\n     Hour 11: -0.91525 -> -0.915\n     Hour 12: -1.79475 -> -1.795\n     Hour 13: -1.01275 -> -1.013\n     Hour 14: -1.02175 -> -1.022\n     Hour 15: -1.38575 -> -1.386\n     Hour 16: -1.6255 -> -1.626\n     Hour 17: -1.83 -> -1.830\n     Hour 18: -2.372 -> -2.372\n     Hour 19: -2.292 -> -2.292\n     Hour 20: -2.3275 -> -2.328\n     Hour 21: -2.60275 -> -2.603\n     Hour 22: -1.55475 -> -1.555\n     Hour 23: -0.43525 -> -0.435\n\n 38. Now, we create the forecast:\n\n      Day1: 2017-03-14: [0.222, 0.213, 0.018, -0.018, ... , -0.435]\n      Day2: 2017-03-15: same 24\n      Day3: 2017-03-16: same\n      Day4: 2017-03-17: same\n\n 39. We write the data.\n\n 40.
