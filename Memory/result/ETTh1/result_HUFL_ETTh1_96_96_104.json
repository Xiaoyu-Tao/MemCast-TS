        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-08-21 00:00:00 to 2017-08-24 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). The pattern: \n    - High values during the day (especially in the afternoon/evening) and low values in the morning (around 8-12 AM).\n 2. There might be a weekly pattern, but we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly seasonality. We'll rely on daily seasonality.\n 3. We can use a time series model that accounts for seasonality. Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and the data is hourly, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n However, note: the data has missing values? The provided 96 points do not have missing values. But the problem says the data will have missing values. \n Since we are only given 96 points without missing values, we assume we are to forecast the next 96 without having to impute in the given data.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n But note: We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must not omit any.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 4 days (96 hours) of data, we might not have enough for a robust model.\n\n However, we can try to capture:\n   - The data shows a daily pattern: \n        * The HUFL drops to a minimum around 10:00 to 12:00 (negative values) and then rises to a peak in the evening (around 20:00-22:00).\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can compute the average daily pattern and then adjust by the trend of the last 4 days? But the trend is not clear.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method:\n   - Compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n   - Then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a naive seasonal forecast.\n\n However, we see that the pattern is not exactly the same every day. There is a slight upward trend? Let's check:\n\n 2017-08-21: max around 16.0, min around -10.0\n 2017-08-22: max around 17.2, min around -10.0\n 2017-08-23: max around 19.7, min around -9.2\n 2017-08-24: max around 19.9, min around -9.9\n\n The max is increasing, but the min is about the same. We might need to account for a trend.\n\n We can do:\n   - Decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual.\n   - Then forecast the trend component and combine with the seasonal component.\n\n But with only 4 days, it's challenging.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - A linear trend for the entire series? Then add the seasonal component.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n\n 1. Extract the hour of day (0-23) for each record.\n 2. Compute the average seasonal component for each hour (over the 4 days).\n 3. Model the trend: We can fit a linear regression on the entire series (with time index as feature) to get a trend line.\n 4. Then the forecast for a future time t is: \n        forecast(t) = trend(t) + seasonal_component(hour of t)\n\n However, note that the trend might not be linear and we have only 96 points. Alternatively, we can use the last day's trend?\n\n But let's try:\n\n We can also consider using a moving average to smooth the trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (Triple Exponential Smoothing) which is designed for seasonality and trend.\n\n We'll use the Holt-Winters method with additive seasonality (since the seasonality amplitude seems constant) and additive trend.\n\n But note: the data has 4 days (96 points) and we want to forecast 96 points (4 days). We can set the seasonality to 24.\n\n However, the Holt-Winters method in statsmodels requires at least two full seasons (so 48 points) which we have.\n\n Implementation: We are not actually running the code, but we have to simulate the process.\n\n But since we are an expert, we can describe the steps and then provide the forecast.\n\n However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must provide the numbers.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the numbers, we can generate a forecast by:\n\n   Step 1: Calculate the hourly averages (seasonal indices) for the 4 days.\n\n   Step 2: Remove the seasonal effect to get the trend component.\n\n        How? We can de-seasonalize by: \n            trend_component = original_series - seasonal_component (for additive model)\n\n        But we don't have the seasonal component for each point? We have the average for each hour.\n\n        So for each point, subtract the average of that hour.\n\n   Step 3: Fit a linear trend to the de-seasonalized series.\n\n        Let t = 0,1,...,95 (time index)\n        Let y_t = de-seasonalized value at time t.\n\n        Then we fit: y_t = a + b*t\n\n   Step 4: Forecast the trend for t=96 to 191 (next 96 points).\n\n   Step 5: Add back the seasonal component for the corresponding hour.\n\n        For time t (in the future), the hour of the day is (t mod 24). We have the average for that hour.\n\n   Step 6: But note: the seasonal indices we computed from the 4 days might not be perfect. We can adjust by normalizing? \n        Actually, in additive decomposition, we usually adjust the seasonal indices so that they sum to zero over a cycle.\n\n        We can adjust: \n            Let s_h for h in 0,23 be the average for hour h over the 4 days.\n            Then we compute the overall average of these 24 values: s_bar = (s0+s1+...+s23)/24.\n            Then subtract s_bar from each s_h to get the adjusted seasonal indices: s'_h = s_h - s_bar.\n\n        Then the de-seasonalized series is: y_t = original_t - s'_{h(t)}\n        And the forecast: forecast_t = (a + b*t) + s'_{h(t)}\n\n However, note: the trend we are fitting is on the de-seasonalized series. Then we add the seasonal component.\n\n But we have only 4 days, so the seasonal indices might be very noisy.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the Holt-Winters additive model without doing the above steps manually.\n\n Since we are to provide the numbers, we can use a library in our mind? But we are an expert in time series, so we can compute.\n\n However, the problem says the data has missing values? But the provided 96 points are complete. So we don't have to impute for the given data.\n\n Let's compute the seasonal indices:\n\n   Group by hour (0 to 23) and take the mean.\n\n   Hour 0: [15.271, 13.798, 17.549, 18.286] -> mean = (15.271+13.798+17.549+18.286)/4 = 16.226\n   Hour 1: [14.937, 12.994, 18.888, 17.817] -> (14.937+12.994+18.888+17.817)/4 = 16.159\n   ... and so on.\n\n   Then we adjust: subtract the overall mean of these 24 hourly means? But note: the overall mean of the entire series is about 5.0 (by quick look) but let's compute:\n\n   We have 96 points. We can compute the overall mean: \n        sum = 15.271+14.937+...+19.96 = let's not compute by hand, but we can do:\n\n        We'll compute the hourly means and then the overall mean = average of hourly means? Actually, it's the same as the average of all points.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the overall mean: \n        We can add all the given HUFL and divide by 96.\n\n   But we don't have to do that by hand? We are an expert so we can approximate: \n        The values range from -10 to 20, and the average seems around 5.\n\n   Actually, let me compute a few:\n\n        Day1: 15.271,14.937,14.87,14.736,15.07,13.798,16.008,13.128,5.961,-2.009,-5.425,-8.774,-10.047,-3.952,-5.492,-6.028,7.904,7.971,10.181,12.19,13.932,13.061,12.659,12.19 -> sum around 15+15+15+15+15+14+16+13+6-2-5-9-10-4-5-6+8+8+10+12+14+13+13+12 = let's do:\n\n        Positive: 15+15+15+15+15+14+16+13+6+8+8+10+12+14+13+13+12 = 15*5=75, 14+16=30, 13*3=39, 6+8+8+10+12=44 -> 75+30+105+44? -> 75+30=105, 105+39=144, 144+44=188\n        Negative: -2-5-9-10-4-5-6 = -41\n        Total for day1: 188-41 = 147 -> average about 6.125\n\n        Day2: 13.798,12.994,12.927,11.32,11.788,12.86,11.989,9.176,6.765,1.273,-3.751,-8.506,-10.047,-9.377,-7.636,-4.421,0.134,5.626,10.181,12.659,17.147,15.74,16.41,17.214\n        Positive: 13.8+13+12.9+11.3+11.8+12.9+12+9.2+6.8+0.1+5.6+10.2+12.7+17.1+15.7+16.4+17.2 -> approx: 14+13+13+11+12+13+12+9+7+0+6+10+13+17+16+16+17 = 14+13=27, 13=40, 11=51, 12=63, 13=76, 12=88, 9=97, 7=104, 6=110, 10=120, 13=133, 17=150, 16=166, 16=182, 17=199 -> 199\n        Negative: -3.75-8.5-10-9.4-7.6-4.4 -> -43.65\n        Total: 199-43.65 = 155.35 -> average about 6.47\n\n        Day3: 17.549,18.888,17.415,14.2,16.075,16.477,14.602,11.655,4.153,-3.952,-7.234,-8.439,-9.243,-7.502,-5.626,-2.947,-0.469,5.023,9.578,13.262,18.353,19.692,18.486,17.817\n        Positive: 17.5+18.9+17.4+14.2+16.1+16.5+14.6+11.7+4.2+5.0+9.6+13.3+18.4+19.7+18.5+17.8 -> 17.5+18.9=36.4, 17.4=53.8, 14.2=68, 16.1=84.1, 16.5=100.6, 14.6=115.2, 11.7=126.9, 4.2=131.1, 5.0=136.1, 9.6=145.7, 13.3=159, 18.4=177.4, 19.7=197.1, 18.5=215.6, 17.8=233.4\n        Negative: -3.95-7.23-8.44-9.24-7.5-5.63-2.95-0.47 -> -44.37\n        Total: 233.4 - 44.37 = 189.03 -> average 7.876\n\n        Day4: 18.286,17.817,16.41,16.745,15.07,13.932,15.405,11.655,4.689,0.603,-5.358,-4.823,-9.913,-7.904,-6.832,-2.21,3.416,6.899,10.784,13.463,18.286,17.415,19.156,19.96\n        Positive: 18.3+17.8+16.4+16.7+15.1+13.9+15.4+11.7+4.7+0.6+3.4+6.9+10.8+13.5+18.3+17.4+19.2+19.96 -> 18.3+17.8=36.1, 16.4=52.5, 16.7=69.2, 15.1=84.3, 13.9=98.2, 15.4=113.6, 11.7=125.3, 4.7=130, 0.6=130.6, 3.4=134, 6.9=140.9, 10.8=151.7, 13.5=165.2, 18.3=183.5, 17.4=200.9, 19.2=220.1, 19.96=240.06\n        Negative: -5.36-4.82-9.91-7.9-6.83-2.21 -> -37.03\n        Total: 240.06 - 37.03 = 203.03 -> average 8.46\n\n        Overall average = (6.125+6.47+7.876+8.46)/4 = (6.125+6.47=12.595, +7.876=20.471, +8.46=28.931) -> 28.931/4 = 7.23275\n\n   So overall mean is about 7.23.\n\n   Now, we compute the hourly means and then adjust by subtracting 7.23?

Actually, we are going to remove the seasonal component to get the trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the overall mean (m) = 7.23 (we'll use the exact if we compute, but we don't have the exact, so we'll compute the exact from the 96 points).\n\n   Let me compute the exact overall mean:\n\n        We have the 96 points.

We can compute:\n\n        Let n = 96\n        sum_t = 0+1+...+95 = 95*96/2 = 4560\n        sum_y = sum of all de-seasonalized values\n        sum_t_y = sum of t * y_t for t=0..95\n        sum_t2 = 0^2+1^2+...+95^2 = 95*96*191/6 = 95*16*191 = 95*3056 = 290320\n\n        Then:\n          b = (n * sum_t_y - sum_t * sum_y) / (n * sum_t2 - (sum_t)^2)\n          a = (sum_y - b * sum_t) / n\n\n        But we don't have the de-seasonalized series by hand? We have to compute 96 points.\n\n        Alternatively, we can approximate the trend by eye? \n\n        Looking at the de-seasonalized series: we removed the daily seasonality, so we should see a trend without seasonality.\n\n        We can compute the average de-seasonalized value for each day and see the trend:\n\n        Day1: average of 24 de-seasonalized points -> but we don't have them.\n\n        We can assume a linear trend from the first and last point of the de-seasonalized series?\n\n        Let's compute the first and last:\n\n          First: 2017-08-21 00:00:00 -> 6.5363\n          Last: 2017-08-24 23:00:00 -> 19.96 - 9.30395 = 10.65605\n\n        Then the slope b = (10.65605 - 6.5363) / 95 = 4.11975/95 = 0.0433658\n\n        Then the intercept a = 6.5363 (at t=0)\n\n        So the trend at time t: a + b*t\n\n        Then for future time t (from 96 to 191):\n\n          trend_t = 6.5363 + 0.0433658 * t\n\n        But note: our t for the first future time (2017-08-25 00:00:00) is 96.\n\n        So for t=96: 6.5363 + 0.0433658*96 = 6.5363 + 4.1631168 = 10.6994168\n\n        Then we add the seasonal index for hour0: 10.6994168 + 8.7347 = 19.4341168\n\n        Similarly, for t=97 (2017-08-25 01:00:00): \n            trend = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*97 = 6.5363 + 4.2064826 = 10.7427826\n            plus seasonal for hour1: 10.7427826 + 8.6677 = 19.4104826\n\n        And so on.\n\n   However, this method uses only two points to fit the trend. We can do better by using the entire series? But we are not able to compute 96 points by hand.\n\n   Given the constraints, we'll use this simple linear trend from the first and last.\n\n   But note: the de-seasonalized series might not be perfectly linear. We see that the last point is 2017-08-24 23:00:00 -> t=95.\n\n        At t=95: trend = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*95 = 6.5363+4.119751 = 10.656051 -> which matches the last de-seasonalized value (10.65605) we computed.\n\n   So it passes the last point.\n\n   Now, we forecast the next 96 points.\n\n   We generate the dates from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n   The time index t from 96 to 191.\n\n   For each t in [96, 191]:\n        hour = t mod 24\n        de_season_t = 6.5363 + 0.0433658 * t\n        forecast_t = de_season_t + seasonal_index[hour]\n\n   We'll compute the first few:\n\n        t=96: hour=0 -> de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*96 = 6.5363 + 4.1631168 = 10.6994168 -> forecast = 10.6994168 + 8.7347 = 19.4341168\n        t=97: hour=1 -> de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*97 = 6.5363+4.2064826=10.7427826 -> forecast = 10.7427826+8.6677=19.4104826\n        t=98: hour=2 -> de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*98 = 6.5363+4.2498484=10.7861484 -> forecast = 10.7861484+7.9142=18.7003484\n        t=99: hour=3 -> de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*99 = 6.5363+4.2932142=10.8295142 -> forecast = 10.8295142+6.75895=17.5884642\n        ...\n\n   We do this for 96 points.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data will have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 numbers.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the linear trend might be too simplistic. The de-seasonalized series might have some structure. But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n   We'll output the forecasted values.\n\n   We must format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date] [value]\n        ...\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n   We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n        Then 2017-08-25 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll write a program in our mind to compute the 96 values.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a small code in our mind:\n\n        t0 = 96\n        for i in range(96):\n            t = t0 + i\n            hour = i % 24\n            de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658 * t\n            forecast = de_season + seasonal_index[hour]\n\n   We have the seasonal_index in an array for hour0 to hour23.\n\n   Let's list the seasonal_index array (0 to 23):\n\n        [8.7347, 8.6677, 7.9142, 6.75895, 7.00945, 6.77545, 7.0097, 3.9122, -2.0993, -8.51255, -12.9333, -15.1268, -17.3038, -14.67505, -13.8878, -11.3928, -4.74505, -1.11155, 2.6897, 5.4022, 9.4382, 8.9857, 9.18645, 9.30395]\n\n   We'll generate the 96 values.\n\n   But note: the linear trend might be increasing? We see the de_season increases by 0.0433658 per hour, which is about 1.04 per day.\n\n   This might be reasonable.\n\n   We'll compute the first 24 hours (2017-08-25) and the last 24 hours (2017-08-28) to see:\n\n        First day (t=96 to 119):\n\n          t=96: 19.4341168\n          t=97: 19.4104826\n          t=98: 18.7003484\n          t=99: 17.5884642\n          t=100: 17.7488668   [hour4: 7.00945 -> 10.7394168+7.00945=17.7488668? \n                de_season for t=100: 6.5363+0.0433658*100 = 6.5363+4.33658=10.87288 -> 10.87288+7.00945=17.88233]\n\n        We did an error: for t=100, hour=4 (since 100 mod 24 = 100 % 24 = 4)\n\n        Let me recalc for t=100:\n            de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*100 = 6.5363 + 4.33658 = 10.87288\n            seasonal_index[4] = 7.00945\n            forecast = 10.87288 + 7.00945 = 17.88233\n\n        Similarly, t=101: hour=5 -> de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*101 = 6.5363+4.3801458=10.9164458, plus 6.77545 -> 17.6918958\n\n        ...\n\n        Last day (t= 168 to 191):\n\n          t=168: hour=168%24=0 -> de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*168 = 6.5363+7.2854544=13.8217544, plus 8.7347 -> 22.5564544\n          t=191: hour=191%24=191-24*7=191-168=23 -> de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*191 = 6.5363+8.2826678=14.8189678, plus 9.30395 -> 24.1229178\n\n   We see the forecast increases over the 4 days.\n\n   We'll generate all 96.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data has missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data. So we output 96 numbers.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the linear trend might be too simplistic. The de-seasonalized series might have some structure. But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n   We'll output the forecasted values.\n\n   We must format the numbers to 6 decimal places? The input had 3, but we can do 3 or 6. The input had 3, but we'll do 3 to match.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates, remember to give me the complete data.\"\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the input had up to 3 decimal places, but we computed with more. We'll round to 3.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        For i in range(96):\n            t = 96 + i\n            hour_index = i % 24\n            de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658 * t\n            forecast = de_season + seasonal_index[hour_index]\n            forecast_rounded = round(forecast, 3)\n\n   But note: the rounding might accumulate. We'll compute and round.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-08-25 00:00:00\n        Then add one hour until 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll write the data in the same format.\n\n   However, to the length, we'll do:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        start_date = datetime(2017,8,25,0,0,0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            # format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n   But we are not coding, we are an expert. We know the dates:\n\n        2017-08-25 00:00:00\n        2017-08-25 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-08-25 23:00:00\n        2017-08-26 00:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-08-28 23:00:00\n\n   We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n   Given the complexity of manual calculation, we'll provide the first few and last few and the rest in between.\n\n   But the problem says: \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we have to provide all 96.\n\n   We'll do it by computing in a systematic way.\n\n   We'll create a table in our mind:\n\n        t = 96: date = \"2017-08-25 00:00:00\", value = 19.434\n        computed: 10.6994168 + 8.7347 = 19.4341168 -> 19.434\n\n        t=97: 10.7427826+8.6677=19.4104826 -> 19.410\n\n        t=98: 10.7861484+7.9142=18.7003484 -> 18.700\n\n        t=99: 10.8295142+6.75895=17.5884642 -> 17.588\n\n        t=100: 10.87288+7.00945=17.88233 -> 17.882\n\n        t=101: 10.9162458+6.77545=17.6916958 -> 17.692\n\n        t=102: 10.9596116+7.0097=17.9693116 -> 17.969\n\n        t=103: 11.0029774+3.9122=14.9151774 -> 14.915\n\n        t=104: 11.0463432-2.0993=8.9470432 -> 8.947\n\n        t=105: 11.089709-8.51255=2.577159 -> 2.577\n\n        t=106: 11.1330748-12.9333=-1.8002252 -> -1.800\n\n        t=107: 11.1764406-15.1268=-3.9503594 -> -3.950\n\n        t=108: 11.2198064-17.3038=-6.0839936 -> -6.084\n\n        t=109: 11.2631722-14.67505=-3.4118778 -> -3.412\n\n        t=110: 11.306538-13.8878=-2.581262 -> -2.581\n\n        t=111: 11.3499038-11.3928=-0.0428962 -> -0.043\n\n        t=112: 11.3932696-4.74505=6.6482196 -> 6.648\n\n        t=113: 11.4366354-1.11155=10.3250854 -> 10.325\n\n        t=114: 11.4800012+2.6897=14.1697012 -> 14.170\n\n        t=115: 11.523367+5.4022=16.925567 -> 16.926\n\n        t=116: 11.5667328+9.4382=21.0049328 -> 21.005\n\n        t=117: 11.6100986+8.9857=20.5957986 -> 20.596\n\n        t=118: 11.6534644+9.18645=20.8399144 -> 20.840\n\n        t=119: 11.6968302+9.30395=21.0007802 -> 21.001\n\n        Then for the next day (2017-08-26) at 00:00:00 (t=120, hour0):\n\n            de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*120 = 6.5363+5.203896 = 11.740196\n            forecast = 11.740196 + 8.7347 = 20.474896 -> 20.475\n\n        And so on.\n\n   We see that the values are increasing.\n\n   We'll compute all 96 and then output.\n\n   But we are an expert and we can do it in a batch.\n\n   We'll write a script in our mind and then output.\n\n   However, due to the length, we'll trust the method and output the 96 values.\n\n   We'll provide the complete list.\n\n   Note: We are rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let's do the last few:\n\n        t=191: \n            de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*191 = 6.5363 + 8.2826678 = 14.8189678\n            seasonal_index[23] = 9.30395\n            forecast = 14.8189678 + 9.30395 = 24.1229178 -> 24.123\n\n   We'll generate the entire list.\n\n   We must be cautious: the linear trend might be too optimistic?

\n\n        That would be an increase of about 1.015 per day? \n\n        But our trend is 0.0433658 per hour, which is 1.04 per day, and the seasonal index for hour23 is the same every day.\n\n        So the increase per day at the same hour should be about 1.04.\n\n        From 21.001 to 22.016: 1.015 -> close to 22.016 to 23.031: 1.015, then to 24.046: 1.015.\n\n        But our method: \n\n            For the same hour (23) on different days:\n\n                day0: t=119 -> 21.001\n                day1: t=143 -> de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*143 = 6.5363+6.2013094=12.7376094, plus 9.30395=22.0415594 -> 22.042\n                day2: t=167 -> de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*167 = 6.5363+7.2420886=13.7783886, plus 9.30395=23.0823386 -> 23.082\n                day3: t=191 -> 24.123\n\n        This does not match the 1.015 per day.\n\n        We see that the difference between t=119 and t=143 is 24 hours, so the de_season increases by 0.0433658*24=1.0407792, so the forecast for the same hour should increase by 1.0407792.\n\n        So from 21.001 to next day same hour: 21.001+1.0407792 = 22.0417792 -> 22.042\n\n        Then next: 22.042+1.0407792=23.0827792 -> 23.083\n        Then next: 23.083+1.0407792=24.1237792 -> 24.124\n\n        So we should have:\n\n            2017-08-25 23:00:00: 21.001\n            2017-08-26 23:00:00: 22.042\n            2017-08-27 23:00:00: 23.083\n            2017-08-28 23:00:00: 24.124\n\n        But in our list above for 2017-08-26 23:00:00 we have 22.016 and for 2017-08-27 23:00:00 23.031, which are not matching.\n\n        This indicates an error in the incremental computation for the entire list.\n\n        Given the time, we decide to recompute only the 23:00:00 for each day and then adjust the entire list by the same offset? \n\n        But it's better to trust the formula for each t.\n\n        We'll recompute the entire list using the formula and then output.\n\n        We'll do it systematically.\n\n        Let's define:\n\n            a = 6.5363\n            b = 0.0433658\n            seasonal = [8.7347, 8.6677, 7.9142, 6.75895, 7.00945, 6.77545, 7.0097, 3.9122, -2.0993, -8.51255, -12.9333, -15.1268, -17.3038, -14.67505, -13.8878, -11.3928, -4.74505, -1.11155, 2.6897, 5.4022, 9.4382, 8.9857, 9.18645, 9.30395]\n\n        Then for i in range(96):\n            t = 96 + i\n            hour = i % 24\n            de_season = a + b * t\n            value = de_season + seasonal[hour]\n            value_rounded = round(value, 3)\n\n        We output the date: start_date = \"2017-08-25 00:00:00\", then add i hours.\n\n        We'll generate the list accordingly.\n\n        We'll do it for the entire 96.\n\n        We trust this computation.\n\n        We'll output the corrected list.\n\n        We see that for i=23 (2017-08-25 23:00:00): \n            t=96+23=119\n            de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*119 = 6.5363 + 5.1605302 = 11.6968302\n            value = 11.6968302 + 9.30395 = 21.0007802 -> 21.001\n\n        for i=47 (2017-08-26 23:00:00):\n            t=96+47=143\n            de_season = 6.5363 + 0.0433658*143 = 6.5363+6.2013094=12.7376094\n            value = 12.7376094+9.30395=22.0415594 -> 22.042\n\n        for i=71 (2017-08-27 23:00:00):\n            t=96+71=167\n            de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*167 = 6.5363+7.2420886=13.7783886\n            value = 13.7783886+9.30395=23.0823386 -> 23.082\n\n        for i=95 (2017-08-28 23:00:00):\n            t=96+95=191\n            de_season = 6.5363+0.0433658*191 = 6.5363+8.2826678=14.8189678\n            value = 14.8189678+9.30395=24.1229178 -> 24.123\n\n        So the last four are: 21.001, 22.042, 23.082, 24.123.\n\n        We must have the entire list computed in this way.\n\n        We'll generate the entire list accordingly.\n\n        We'll provide the complete list.\n\n        Due to the length, we rely on the formula.\n\n        Final output:\n\n        (We are an expert, we can do it mentally, but we are to provide the numbers, so we output as below)\n\n        We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n        Note: We are rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n        We'll start from 2017-08-25 00:00:00 to 2017-08-28 23:00:00.\n\n        We do it.\n",
