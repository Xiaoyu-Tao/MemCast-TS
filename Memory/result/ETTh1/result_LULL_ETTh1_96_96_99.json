        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-01 00:00:00 to 2017-08-04 23:00:00) for the Low UseLess Load (LULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there might be missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 3. Since the data is time series with potential seasonality (daily cycles: 24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n Approach:\n - We'll use a seasonal model. Given the data is hourly and we expect daily seasonality (period=24), we can use SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters).\n - However, note that we only have 4 days of data (96 hours) which is very limited. This makes it challenging to fit a model with multiple seasonal parameters.\n\n Considering the constraints:\n - We can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the trend and seasonality.\n - Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: forecast each hour by the average of that hour in the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days.\n\n Given the limited data, we can try:\n   - Using the last available day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be 24 hours, and we need 96 (4 days).\n   - Alternatively, we can take the average of each hour across the 4 days and use that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data shows some variation and we don't have a clear trend. Also, the problem says there might be missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none.\n\n Proposed method:\n   We will compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 available days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Steps for the method:\n   - Group the data by hour (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the mean for each hour.\n   - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we assign the corresponding hourly average.\n\n Why this method?\n   - It captures the daily seasonality and is simple.\n   - With only 4 days, we don't have enough data to fit a complex model.\n\n But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall average per day:\n   Day 1: average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n   Day 2: similarly\n   Day 3: \n   Day 4:\n\n We can compute:\n   Day1: 2017-08-01: average = (1.523+1.584+...+0.975)/24 -> let's calculate roughly: \n        but we don't need to, because if there is a trend we might adjust.\n\n However, looking at the data, the values on day1 and day2 are generally higher than day3 and day4? \n   For example, on day1 at 00:00: 1.523, day2: 1.310, day3: 0.822, day4: 0.731 -> decreasing? \n   But then at 04:00: day1:1.066, day2:1.097, day3:0.761, day4:0.731 -> also decreasing.\n\n But note: the last day (day4) ends at 0.975 at 23:00, and the next day (forecast) starts at 00:00. \n\n However, with only 4 days, it's hard to establish a trend. We might consider a simple moving average without trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) as the base and adjust by the overall trend of the averages? \n\n But to keep it simple and given the instructions, we'll use the hourly average over the 4 days.\n\n Steps in code (if we were coding) but we have to do it manually:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the hour from the datetime.\n   Step 2: Group by hour and compute the mean.\n\n However, we are to do it by hand? We have 24 hours and 4 days.\n\n We can create a table for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n Example for hour=0 (00:00):\n   Day1: 1.523\n   Day2: 1.310\n   Day3: 0.822\n   Day4: 0.731\n   Average = (1.523 + 1.310 + 0.822 + 0.731) / 4 = 4.386 / 4 = 1.0965\n\n Similarly for hour=1 (01:00):\n   Day1: 1.584\n   Day2: 1.005\n   Day3: 0.640\n   Day4: 0.761\n   Average = (1.584+1.005+0.640+0.761)/4 = 3.99/4 = 0.9975\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Then, for the next 4 days (2017-08-05 to 2017-08-08), we assign:\n   2017-08-05 00:00:00 -> average for hour0 = 1.0965\n   2017-08-05 01:00:00 -> average for hour1 = 0.9975\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the last provided data point is 2017-08-04 23:00:00 -> 0.975.\n The next point is 2017-08-05 00:00:00.\n\n We have to generate 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours.\n\n However, the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the forecast we are to provide complete data.\n\n We'll generate the 96 points by repeating the 24 hourly averages for 4 days.\n\n But note: the averages are computed from the past 4 days, so we are effectively using the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n Hour 0: (1.523 + 1.310 + 0.822 + 0.731) / 4 = 4.386/4 = 1.0965 -> round to 3 decimals? The data has 3 decimals. So 1.097\n   But note: 1.523+1.310=2.833; 2.833+0.822=3.655; 3.655+0.731=4.386 -> 4.386/4=1.0965 -> we can round to 1.097? \n   However, the original data has up to 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Let's do it for all 24 hours:\n\n Hour 0 (00:00): [1.523, 1.310, 0.822, 0.731] -> sum=4.386 -> avg=1.0965 -> 1.097\n Hour 1 (01:00): [1.584, 1.005, 0.640, 0.761] -> 1.584+1.005=2.589;

We are to output two columns: the date string and the value.\n\n However, the example input had:\n\n        date  LULL\n 2017-08-01 00:00:00 1.523\n\n So we output: \"2017-08-05 00:00:00\" and then the value.\n\n We'll write without the header and without the index.\n\n We'll write 96 lines.\n\n Let's generate the dates:\n\n   Day 5: 2017-08-05\n   Day 6: 2017-08-06\n   Day 7: 2017-08-07\n   Day 8: 2017-08-08\n\n And for each day, we have the 24 values in the order above.\n\n We'll write the data accordingly.\n\n Since it's repetitive, we can do:\n\n   for day in [5,6,7,8]:\n        for hour in range(0,24):\n            date_str = f\"2017-08-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n            value = hourly_avg[hour]\n\n But we are writing by hand? We can write the first day and then copy and change the day? \n\n However, we have the list of 24 values. We'll write:\n\n   Day5: 2017-08-05, then the 24 values in order.\n   Day6: 2017-08-06, same 24 values.\n\n We'll write the entire 96 lines.\n\n But note: the day must be two digits: 05,06,07,08.\n\n Let's write the data.\n\n We have the list of averages:\n\n averages = [\n     1.097, 0.998, 0.868, 0.937, 0.914, 1.005, 0.960, 1.051, \n     1.173, 1.249, 1.150, 1.081, 1.081, 1.043, 1.142, 1.142, \n     1.165, 1.150, 1.074, 0.876, 0.982, 0.899, 0.952, 0.876\n ]\n\n We'll generate:\n\n   for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n        day = 5 + day_offset\n        for hour_index in range(24):\n            date = f\"2017-08-{day:02} {hour_index:02}:00:00\"\n            value = averages[hour_index]\n\n But note: the hour in the string must be two digits: e.g., 00, 01, ... 23.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   Line 1: \"2017-08-05 00:00:00,1.097\"\n   Line 2: \"2017-08-05 01:00:00,0.998\"\n   ...\n\n   Line 25: \"2017-08-06 00:00:00,1.097\"\n   ...\n\n   Line 96: \"2017-08-08 23:00:00,0.876\"\n\n We'll write the entire block.\n\n But note: the original data had the value without quotes and just the number.\n\n We must output exactly in the same format.\n\n Let's write the first few and last few:\n\n  2017-08-05 00:00:00,1.097\n  2017-08-05 01:00:00,0.998\n  2017-08-05 02:00:00,0.868\n  2017-08-05 03:00:00,0.937\n  2017-08-05 04:00:00,0.914\n  2017-08-05 05:00:00,1.005\n  2017-08-05 06:00:00,0.960\n  2017-08-05 07:00:00,1.051\n  2017-08-05 08:00:00,1.173\n  2017-08-05 09:00:00,1.249\n  2017-08-05 10:00:00,1.150\n  2017-08-05 11:00:00,1.081\n  2017-08-05 12:00:00,1.081\n  2017-08-05 13:00:00,1.043\n  2017-08-05 14:00:00,1.142\n  2017-08-05 15:00:00,1.142\n  2017-08-05 16:00:00,1.165\n  2017-08-05 17:00:00,1.150\n  2017-08-05 18:00:00,1.074\n  2017-08-05 19:00:00,0.876\n  2017-08-05 20:00:00,0.982\n  2017-08-05 21:00:00,0.899\n  2017-08-05 22:00:00,0.952\n  2017-08-05 23:00:00,0.876\n\n  2017-08-06 00:00:00,1.097\n  2017-08-06 01:00:00,0.998\n  ... and so on.\n\n We'll write the entire 96 lines in the answer block.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n We'll write all 96 lines.\n\n However, to save space in the response, we can write the entire block as a code block.\n\n But note: the instruction says to use the format:\n\n    <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        ...\n        \n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n We'll write the 96 lines inside the triple backticks.\n\n Let's do it.\n",
