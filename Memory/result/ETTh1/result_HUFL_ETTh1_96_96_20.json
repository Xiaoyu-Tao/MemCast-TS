        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2016-09-19 00:00:00 to 2016-09-22 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 96 points in the future would be the next 4 days.\n\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might have missing values. However, for the purpose of forecasting, we can use the provided 96 points to build a model.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data is relatively short (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points ahead, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal models: The data seems to have daily seasonality (24 hours in a day). We can use a seasonal naive method, or more advanced models like SARIMA, or Exponential Smoothing with seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data provided is only 4 days. We can observe:\n    - There is a pattern that repeats every day? Let's check the data:\n\n        Day 1 (19th): \n          - Starts around 9.8, then drops to around 7.9 at 5:00, then peaks at 12.5 at 6:00, then gradually decreases until 15:00 (around 5.6) and then increases again in the evening to around 8.6 at 22:00.\n\n        Day 2 (20th): \n          - Starts at 12.86, then drops to 11.32, then 12.32 at 4:00, then 12.32 at 5:00, then 13.53 at 6:00, then decreases to 9.1 at 8:00, then 8.0 at 9:00, then 8.77 at 10:00, then down to 6.0 at 12:00, then up to 6.76 at 17:00, then 9.44 at 22:00 and 13.2 at 23:00.\n\n        Day 3 (21st): \n          - Starts at 14.2, then 13.4, 12.4, 12.9, 12.3, then 14.1 at 5:00, 15.07 at 6:00 and 7:00, then drops to 11.9 at 8:00, then 7.5 at 9:00, then 8.4 at 10:00, then 8.2 at 11:00, then down to 5.3 at 12:00, then up to 6.2 at 14:00, 6.6 at 15:00, then 6.7 at 17:00, then 6.4 at 19:00, then down to 5.4 at 21:00, then 6.5 at 22:00 and 8.2 at 23:00.\n\n        Day 4 (22nd): \n          - Starts at 11.85, then 10.7, 11.8, 11.8, 10.2, then 13.3 at 5:00, 13.6 at 6:00, 11.6 at 7:00, then 8.9 at 8:00, 7.6 at 9:00, 7.9 at 10:00, 8.1 at 11:00, 6.3 at 12:00, 6.1 at 13:00, 6.8 at 14:00, 8.2 at 15:00, 6.0 at 16:00, 7.2 at 17:00, 6.2 at 18:00, 6.3 at 19:00, 6.0 at 20:00, 5.8 at 21:00, 6.3 at 22:00, and 10.0 at 23:00.\n\n    We can see that each day has:\n        - A peak in the early morning (around 6:00-7:00) and then a drop during the day, and then a rise in the evening (around 22:00-23:00) and then again at night.\n\n    However, the pattern is not exactly the same. The magnitude of the peaks and the exact timing of the drops and rises vary.\n\n 5. Given the short history, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality. One simple method is the seasonal naive method, which uses the value from the same hour in the previous season (i.e., the same hour of the previous day) as the forecast.\n\n    But note: we have 4 days of data. We can use the last day (day 4) as the forecast for the next day? However, we are to forecast 4 days (96 hours). So we can use:\n\n        Day 5: same as day 1? \n        Day 6: same as day 2?\n        Day 7: same as day 3?\n        Day 8: same as day 4?\n\n    But the data we have is from day1 (19th) to day4 (22nd). The next day would be 23rd, then 24th, 25th, 26th.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But 4 days is very short.\n\n 6. Another approach: Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). We can use the additive or multiplicative model. Given the seasonality pattern seems to have a consistent period (24 hours), we can try additive.\n\n 7. However, note: the data might have a trend? Let's see the overall: \n    - The first day: average around (9.8+9.9+...+8.5)/24 -> let's not compute exactly, but we can see the values are in the range 5-12.\n    - The second day: 12.8 at 00:00, then 13.2 at 23:00 -> similar range.\n    - The third day: 14.2 at 00:00, then 8.2 at 23:00 -> again similar.\n    - The fourth day: 11.8 at 00:00, then 10.0 at 23:00.\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can use a simple method: \n    - Use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    For example, for the hour 00:00, we have:\n        Day1: 9.846\n        Day2: 12.860\n        Day3: 14.200\n        Day4: 11.855\n\n        Average = (9.846 + 12.860 + 14.200 + 11.855) / 4 = 12.19025\n\n    Then for the next 4 days at 00:00, we would use 12.19025? But that would be the same for each day? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving window? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the last day (day4) as the forecast for the next day (day5), then use day1 for day6? because we don't have day5. But that would be arbitrary.\n\n 10. Given the short history, we can use a seasonal naive method with the last season (i.e., the last day) repeated for the next 4 days? \n\n    But note: the last day (22nd) is a Thursday? and the next days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? and the pattern might be different on weekends? But we don't have information about weekends in the history (19th is Monday, 20th Tuesday, 21st Wednesday, 22nd Thursday). So the next 4 days would be Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\n\n    Without weekend data, we cannot adjust for weekly seasonality.\n\n 11. Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the 4 days we have. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out the day-to-day variations.\n\n    Steps:\n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n        Then, for the next 4 days, we use that same 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 days.\n\n    Example for hour 0: average = (9.846 + 12.860 + 14.200 + 11.855) / 4 = 12.19025\n    Then for the next 4 days at 00:00:00, we use 12.19025.\n\n    Similarly for hour 1: average = (9.980 + 11.320 + 13.396 + 10.717) / 4 = 11.35325\n\n    and so on.\n\n 12. Why this method?\n    - It is simple and captures the daily seasonality.\n    - It is robust to missing values? We are averaging, so if one day is missing we could use the average of the others? But in our case, we have no missing in the provided 96 points.\n\n 13. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided 96 points do not have missing. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 14. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 15. Then, the next 96 hours (from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00) will be filled with the 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 16. Let's compute the averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (9.846 + 12.860 + 14.200 + 11.855) / 4 = 12.19025\n    Hour 1: (9.980 + 11.320 + 13.396 + 10.717) / 4 = 11.35325\n    Hour 2: (9.511 + 11.855 + 12.458 + 11.788) / 4 = 11.403\n    Hour 3: (9.779 + 12.324 + 12.927 + 11.855) / 4 = 11.72125\n    Hour 4: (9.176 + 11.855 + 12.324 + 10.181) / 4 = 10.884\n    Hour 5: (7.904 + 12.324 + 14.133 + 13.329) / 4 = 11.9225\n    Hour 6: (12.525 + 13.530 + 15.070 + 13.597) / 4 = 13.6805\n    Hour 7: (12.458 + 12.458 + 15.070 + 11.588) / 4 = 12.8935\n    Hour 8: (9.980 + 9.109 + 11.922 + 8.975) / 4 = 9.9965\n    Hour 9: (7.301 + 8.038 + 7.502 + 7.636) / 4 = 7.61925\n    Hour 10: (7.770 + 8.774 + 8.439 + 7.904) / 4 = 8.22175\n    Hour 11: (8.640 + 8.105 + 8.239 + 8.105) / 4 = 8.27225\n    Hour 12: (6.497 + 6.162 + 5.358 + 6.363) / 4 = 6.095\n    Hour 13: (5.827 + 6.028 + 5.425 + 6.095) / 4 = 5.84375\n    Hour 14: (6.028 + 6.229 + 6.229 + 6.832) / 4 = 6.3295\n    Hour 15: (5.626 + 6.296 + 6.631 + 8.172) / 4 = 6.68125\n    Hour 16: (5.827 + 5.760 + 5.961 + 6.028) / 4 = 5.894\n    Hour 17: (6.765 + 6.363 + 6.698 + 7.167) / 4 = 6.74825\n    Hour 18: (6.095 + 5.961 + 6.229 + 6.162) / 4 = 6.11175\n    Hour 19: (6.430 + 6.765 + 6.430 + 6.363) / 4 = 6.497\n    Hour 20: (6.028 + 6.028 + 5.894 + 6.028) / 4 = 5.9945\n    Hour 21: (5.961 + 7.100 + 5.425 + 5.827) / 4 = 6.07825\n    Hour 22: (8.640 + 9.444 + 6.564 + 6.363) / 4 = 7.75275\n    Hour 23: (8.573 + 13.195 + 8.239 + 10.047) / 4 = 10.0135\n\n 17. Now, we create the next 4 days:\n\n    Day 5: 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-23 23:00:00: \n        00:00:00 -> 12.19025\n        01:00:00 -> 11.35325\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 10.0135\n\n    Day 6: 2016-09-24: same 24 values as above averages)\n    Day 7: 2016-09-25: same\n    Day 8: 2016-09-26: same\n\n 18. Format the dates: \n        Start: 2016-09-23 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-09-23 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-26 23:00:00.\n\n 19. We must output 96 lines.\n\n 20. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals.\n\n 21. However, note: the problem says \"complete data\", so we output the 96 points.\n\n 22. Let's write the data:\n\n        date, HUFL\n        2016-09-23 00:00:00, 12.190\n        2016-09-23 01:00:00, 11.353\n        ... \n\n 23. But note: the input had 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 24. However, the problem says \"mustn't omit any content\", so we output the full 96 points.\n\n 25. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-23 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour until 2016-09-23 23:00:00 (24 hours for the first day)\n        Then 2016-09-24 00:00:00 to 23:00:00 (next 24)\n        Then 2016-09-25 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-09-26 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n 26. We have 4 days * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n 27. The average values for the 24 hours (rounded to 3 decimals):\n\n        Hour0: 12.190\n        Hour1: 11.353\n        Hour2: 11.403\n        Hour3: 11.721\n        Hour4: 10.884\n        Hour5: 11.923\n        Hour6: 13.681\n        Hour7: 12.894\n        Hour8: 9.997\n        Hour9: 7.619\n        Hour10: 8.222\n        Hour11: 8.272\n        Hour12: 6.095\n        Hour13: 5.844\n        Hour14: 6.330\n        Hour15: 6.681\n        Hour16: 5.894\n        Hour17: 6.748\n        Hour18: 6.112\n        Hour19: 6.497\n        Hour20: 5.995\n        Hour21: 6.078\n        Hour22: 7.753\n        Hour23: 10.014\n\n 28. Now, we'll write the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1 (23rd): \n            00:00:00 -> 12.190\n            01:00:00 -> 11.353\n            02:00:00 -> 11.403\n            03:00:00 -> 11.721\n            04:00:00 -> 10.884\n            05:00:00 -> 11.923\n            06:00:00 -> 13.681\n            07:00:00 -> 12.894\n            08:00:00 -> 9.997\n            09:00:00 -> 7.619\n            10:00:00 -> 8.222\n            11:00:00 -> 8.272\n            12:00:00 -> 6.095\n            13:00:00 -> 5.844\n            14:00:00 -> 6.330\n            15:00:00 -> 6.681\n            16:00:00 -> 5.894\n            17:00:00 -> 6.748\n            18:00:00 -> 6.112\n            19:00:00 -> 6.497\n            20:00:00 -> 5.995\n            21:00:00 -> 6.078\n            22:00:00 -> 7.753\n            23:00:00 -> 10.014\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next three days (24th, 25th, 26th).\n\n 29. We output in the required format.\n\n 30. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 31. We'll write the data in the same format as the input: two columns: 'date' and 'HUFL', with the date as a string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.\n\n 32. We'll generate the dates using Python's date range? But since we are writing manually, we can do:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-23 00:00:00\n        Then 2016-09-23 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-23 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-09-24 00:00:00, ... until 2016-09-24 23:00:00\n        Then 2016-09-25 00:00:00, ... \n        Then 2016-09-26 00:00:00 ... until 2016-09-26 23:00:00\n\n 33. We have 96 points.\n\n 34. We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n 35. However, note: the problem says \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 time points.\n\n 36. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        date,HUFL\n        2016-09-23 00:00:00,12.190\n        2016-09-23 01:00:00,11.353\n        ... (all 96 lines)\n        </answer>\n\n 37. But note: the input had the date as a string without quotes and the HUFL as a float with 3 decimals.\n\n 38. We'll write without quotes.\n\n 39. Let's generate the 96 lines.\n\n 40. We have the 24 values for one day. We'll repeat them 4 times.\n\n 41. The dates:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-23\n        Day2: 2016-09-24\n        Day3: 2016-09-25\n        Day4: 2016-09-26\n\n 42. We'll write:\n\n        for day in [23, 24, 25, 26]:\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date_str = f\"2016-09-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = the value for that hour (from the 24 averages)\n\n 43. But note: the day must be two digits: 23, 25, 26 are two digits, but 24,25,26 are also two digits.\n\n 44. We'll do:\n\n        dates = []\n        for i in range(0, 96):\n            base_date = datetime(2016, 9, 23) + timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(base_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n 45. But we are not coding, we are writing the output.\n\n 46. We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n 47. The 24 values (in order of hour 0 to 23) are:\n\n        [12.190, 11.353, 11.403, 11.721, 10.884, 11.923, 13.681, 12.894, 9.997, 7.619, 8.222, 8.272, 6.095, 5.844, 6.330, 6.681, 5.894, 6.748, 6.112, 6.497, 5.995, 6.078, 7.753, 10.014]\n\n 48. We'll write 4 times.\n\n 49. We must be careful: the day 23, then 24, then 25, then 26.\n\n 50.
