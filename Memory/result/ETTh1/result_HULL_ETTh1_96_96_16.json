        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-03 00:00:00 to 2016-09-06 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missingness in the input, but here we have a complete block.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 4 days.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 96 points) and the hourly frequency, we can consider:\n    - Seasonal decomposition: The data might have daily seasonality (24 hours). We observe that the data seems to have a pattern within a day.\n\n 4. We can use a model that captures seasonality. One common approach for such short-term forecasting with seasonality is to use the Seasonal Naive method, \n    where we forecast each hour by taking the value from the same hour in the previous day. However, we have 4 days of history, so we can average the same hour over the available days.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA models that account for seasonality (like SARIMA). But with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA might be challenging.\n\n 5. Given the constraints, a simple approach is to use a moving window of the same hour from the last few days. Since we have 4 days, we can take the average of the same hour for the past 4 days.\n\n    For example, to forecast 2016-09-07 00:00:00 (which is the first hour of the next day), we take the average of:\n        2016-09-03 00:00:00: 5.693\n        2016-09-04 00:00:00: 4.823\n        2016-09-05 00:00:00: 6.966\n        2016-09-06 00:00:00: 5.827\n\n    Then the forecast for 2016-09-07 00:00:00 would be (5.693+4.823+6.966+5.827)/4 = 5.82725.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might have a trend? Let's look at the overall level:\n\n        Day 1 (Sep 3): values range from about 3.55 to 7.37\n        Day 2 (Sep 4): 3.01 to 6.03\n        Day 3 (Sep 5): 3.15 to 7.03\n        Day 4 (Sep 6): 2.41 to 5.83\n\n    There is a slight downward trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to tell. We might also consider using a weighted average where more recent days are given more weight.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing model with seasonality. But without a library, we have to do it manually.\n\n 8. Considering the requirement for simplicity and the fact that we have to provide 96 points, we can use the following:\n\n    Method: Seasonal Naive with averaging the same hour from the last 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        Let H be the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n        For each hour H in [0,23] for the next 4 days (so 4*24=96 hours), we do:\n            forecast = average of the H-th hour from the past 4 days.\n\n    But note: the past 4 days are Sep 3, 4, 5, 6. We are forecasting Sep 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\n    Actually, the last date in the input is 2016-09-06 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00.\n\n    We can compute:\n\n        For hour 0: average of [5.693 (Sep3), 4.823 (Sep4), 6.966 (Sep5), 5.827 (Sep6)] -> 5.82725\n        For hour 1: average of [7.368, 5.157, 6.698, 5.425] -> 6.162\n\n    and so on.\n\n 9. However, we must note that the data might have missing value in the input? But the provided input is complete. So we can proceed.\n\n 10. But what if we want to account for a possible trend? We could use a moving average and then adjust by the average change per day? \n     However, the trend is not clear. Alternatively, we can use Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing) if we can fit it. But with only 4 days (96 points) and 24 seasons, \n     it might be over-parameterized.\n\n 11. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide the data, we will use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days.\n\n 12. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-07 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-09-06 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-09-07 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-10 23:00:00.\n\n 13. For each hour H (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, we compute:\n\n        value = (D1[H] + D2[H] + D3[H] + D4[H]) / 4\n\n     where D1 is the value from the same hour on 2016-09-03, D2 from 2016-09-04, D3 from 2016-09-05, D4 from 2016-09-06.\n\n 14. However, note that the data for the same hour might not be exactly at the same position? We have 24 hours per day, so:\n\n        Day1: index 0 to 23 -> 2016-09-03\n        Day2: index 24 to 47 -> 2016-09-04\n        Day3: index 48 to 71 -> 2016-09-05\n        Day4: index 72 to 95 -> 2016-09-06\n\n     For hour 0: \n        Day1: index0 -> 5.693\n        Day2: index24 -> 4.823\n        Day3: index48 -> 6.966\n        Day4: index72 -> 5.827\n\n 15. We can code this as:\n\n        Let data = the list of 96 values in order.\n\n        For the first forecast day (day5: 2016-09-07), hour H (0<=H<24):\n            forecast[H] = (data[H] + data[H+24] + data[H+48] + data[H+72]) / 4.0\n\n        Similarly, for the second forecast day (day6: 2016-09-08), we use the same formula? But note: we are only using the same hour from the previous 4 days.\n\n        However, for the second day, we don't have a direct history. But we are forecasting 4 days, so we can use the same set of 4 days for every hour in the forecast period?\n\n        Actually, we are using the same 4 days for every hour in the forecast. That is, the forecast for every hour H (0-23) in any of the 4 days is the same: the average of the same hour from the past 4 days.\n\n        This method does not account for the fact that the next day might be different from the previous days. But with no other information, it's a simple baseline.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a rolling window of the last 4 days for each hour. But note that the forecast for the second day (2016-09-08) would then be the same as the first day (2016-09-07) because we are using the same 4 days? \n\n        Actually, we are not using the forecasted values. We are using only the historical 4 days for every hour in the forecast horizon.\n\n        So the entire forecast for the next 4 days will be a repetition of the same 24-hour pattern (which is the average of the past 4 days for each hour).\n\n 17. This is a simple and common method for short-term forecasting when seasonality is daily.\n\n 18. Let's compute the 24 values for the average day:\n\n        H0: (5.693 + 4.823 + 6.966 + 5.827) / 4 = 5.82725\n        H1: (7.368 + 5.157 + 6.698 + 5.425) / 4 = 6.162\n        H2: (6.765 + 4.957 + 6.564 + 4.756) / 4 = 5.7605\n        H3: (6.497 + 5.693 + 6.832 + 5.023) / 4 = 6.01125\n        H4: (5.693 + 5.157 + 6.162 + 5.157) / 4 = 5.54225\n        H5: (6.899 + 4.823 + 5.157 + 5.425) / 4 = 5.576\n        H6: (7.301 + 6.028 + 6.564 + 4.555) / 4 = 6.112\n        H7: (6.899 + 4.890 + 6.832 + 5.358) / 4 = 5.99475\n        H8: (5.693 + 4.555 + 7.033 + 4.220) / 4 = 5.37525\n        H9: (5.760 + 4.354 + 6.028 + 4.689) / 4 = 5.20775\n        H10: (5.626 + 4.488 + 4.957 + 4.957) / 4 = 5.007\n        H11: (4.957 + 3.885 + 4.354 + 4.354) / 4 = 4.3875\n        H12: (4.823 + 3.014 + 4.287 + 3.550) / 4 = 3.9185\n        H13: (5.157 + 3.148 + 4.354 + 3.550) / 4 = 4.05225\n        H14: (5.090 + 3.416 + 4.823 + 3.215) / 4 = 4.136\n        H15: (5.224 + 3.885 + 4.287 + 3.751) / 4 = 4.28675\n        H16: (4.890 + 3.751 + 4.220 + 3.081) / 4 = 3.9855\n        H17: (4.823 + 3.751 + 4.153 + 3.550) / 4 = 4.06925\n        H18: (4.019 + 3.282 + 3.885 + 2.813) / 4 = 3.49975\n        H19: (3.550 + 3.081 + 3.349 + 2.411) / 4 = 3.09775\n        H20: (3.550 + 3.081 + 3.282 + 2.411) / 4 = 3.081\n        H21: (4.153 + 3.751 + 3.148 + 2.679) / 4 = 3.43275\n        H22: (4.354 + 4.689 + 3.483 + 2.478) / 4 = 3.751\n        H23: (5.224 + 5.358 + 3.885 + 3.416) / 4 = 4.47075\n\n 19. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-09-07 to 2016-09-10) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2016-09-07): [H0, H1, ..., H23] as above.\n        Day2 (2016-09-08): same 24 values as above ].\n        Day3 (2016-09-09): same 24 values.\n        Day4 (2016-09-10): same 24 values.\n\n 20. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are not told that the future has missing values? We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 21. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 22. However, we must note: this method does not account for any trend or changing conditions. But with the information given, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 23. Let's write the forecast:\n\n        We'll generate the dates from 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00.\n\n        And the HULL values will be the 24 values we computed above, repeated for each day.\n\n 24. We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 25. Example for the first day:\n\n        2016-09-07 00:00:00 5.827\n        2016-09-07 01:00:00 6.162\n        ... \n\n 26. But note: the computed averages might have more than 3 decimals. We round to 3 decimals.\n\n 27. Let's recalc with rounding:\n\n        H0: 5.693+4.823+6.966+5.827 = 23.309 -> 23.309/4=5.82725 -> 5.827\n        H1: 7.368+5.157+6.698+5.425 = 24.648 -> 24.648/4=6.162 -> 6.162\n        H2: 6.765+4.957+6.564+4.756 = 23.042 -> 23.042/4=5.7605 -> 5.761 (if we round to 3 decimals, but note the input has 3 decimals so we do the same)\n\n        However, the input has 3 decimal places. We should round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n            H0: round(5.82725, 3) -> 5.827\n            H1: round(6.162, 3) -> 6.162\n            H2: round(5.7605, 3) -> 5.761 (because 5.7605 rounded to 3 decimals is 5.761)\n\n        But note: the input sometimes has 3 decimals and sometimes 2? Actually, all have 3.\n\n        We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 28. We recalc all 24 hours with rounding to 3 decimals.\n\n        H0: (5.693+4.823+6.966+5.827)/4 = 23.309/4 = 5.82725 -> 5.827\n        H1: (7.368+5.157+6.698+5.425)/4 = 24.648/4 = 6.162 -> 6.162\n        H2: (6.765+4.957+6.564+4.756)/4 = 23.042/4 = 5.7605 -> 5.761\n        H3: (6.497+5.693+6.832+5.023)/4 = 24.045/4 = 6.01125 -> 6.011\n        H4: (5.693+5.157+6.162+5.157)/4 = 22.169/4 = 5.54225 -> 5.542\n        H5: (6.899+4.823+5.157+5.425)/4 = 22.304/4 = 5.576 -> 5.576\n        H6: (7.301+6.028+6.564+4.555)/4 = 24.448/4 = 6.112 -> 6.112\n        H7: (6.899+4.890+6.832+5.358)/4 = 23.979/4 = 5.99475 -> 5.995\n        H8: (5.693+4.555+7.033+4.220)/4 = 21.501/4 = 5.37525 -> 5.375\n        H9: (5.760+4.354+6.028+4.689)/4 = 20.831/4 = 5.20775 -> 5.208\n        H10: (5.626+4.488+4.957+4.957)/4 = 20.028/4 = 5.007 -> 5.007\n        H11: (4.957+3.885+4.354+4.354)/4 = 17.55/4 = 4.3875 -> 4.388\n        H12: (4.823+3.014+4.287+3.550)/4 = 15.674/4 = 3.9185 -> 3.919\n        H13: (5.157+3.148+4.354+3.550)/4 = 16.209/4 = 4.05225 -> 4.052\n        H14: (5.090+3.416+4.823+3.215)/4 = 16.544/4 = 4.136 -> 4.136\n        H15: (5.224+3.885+4.287+3.751)/4 = 17.147/4 = 4.28675 -> 4.287\n        H16: (4.890+3.751+4.220+3.081)/4 = 15.942/4 = 3.9855 -> 3.986\n        H17: (4.823+3.751+4.153+3.550)/4 = 16.277/4 = 4.06925 -> 4.069\n        H18: (4.019+3.282+3.885+2.813)/4 = 13.999/4 = 3.49975 -> 3.500\n        H19: (3.550+3.081+3.349+2.411)/4 = 12.391/4 = 3.09775 -> 3.098\n        H20: (3.550+3.081+3.282+2.411)/4 = 12.324/4 = 3.081 -> 3.081\n        H21: (4.153+3.751+3.148+2.679)/4 = 13.731/4 = 3.43275 -> 3.433\n        H22: (4.354+4.689+3.483+2.478)/4 = 15.004/4 = 3.751 -> 3.751\n        H23: (5.224+5.358+3.885+3.416)/4 = 17.883/4 = 4.47075 -> 4.471\n\n 29. Now, we write the next 96 points:\n\n        Day1: 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 23:00:00: [H0, H1, ..., H23] as above.\n        Day2: 2016-09-08 00:00:00 to 23:00:00: same 24 values.\n        Day3: same\n        Day4: same\n\n 30.
