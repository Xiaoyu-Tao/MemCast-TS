        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and there are 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing. However, we must be cautious.\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points (from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Since we are experts in time series forecasting, we can use a suitable model. Given the hourly data and the relatively short history, \n we can consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple naive approach. However, without more context and given the \n requirement to provide a complete set of 96 points, we must generate a forecast.\n\n However, note: The problem states that the data will have missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96.\n\n Considering the data, we observe:\n   - There is a daily seasonality (24 hours) and also a pattern that repeats every day.\n   - The temperature seems to have a daily cycle: lower at night and higher during the day.\n\n We can use a seasonal model. Since we are limited by the data (only 4 days) and we need to forecast 4 days, we can use a seasonal naive method, \n but that would just repeat the last day. Alternatively, we can use an average of the four days for each hour.\n\n However, let's look at the data:\n\n   The last day (2017-03-17) has:\n      00:00: 9.919\n      01:00: 9.778\n      ... \n      23:00: 9.778\n\n But note: the data for 2017-03-17 23:00:00 is given as 9.778? Actually, the last point is 2017-03-17 23:00:00 -> 9.778? \n But in the data, the last point is: 2017-03-17 23:00:00  9.778? Actually, the last few points of 2017-03-17:\n\n      2017-03-17 22:00:00  9.497\n      2017-03-17 23:00:00  9.778   (as per the last line)\n\n However, the data provided ends at 2017-03-17 23:00:00 with value 9.778.\n\n But wait, the data for 2017-03-17 23:00:00 is actually the last point? Let me check:\n\n  The data starts at 2017-03-14 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-03-17 23:00:00 -> that's 4 full days (4*24=96 points). So we have 96 points.\n\n How to forecast?\n\n Option 1: Use the average of each hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n   For example, for hour 00:00:00, we have:\n        2017-03-14: 6.824\n        2017-03-15: 8.090\n        2017-03-16: 9.286\n        2017-03-17: 9.919\n        Average = (6.824 + 8.090 + 9.286 + 9.919) / 4 = 8.52975\n\n   Then for the next 4 days at 00:00:00, we use 8.52975.\n\n   Similarly for each hour.\n\n Option 2: Use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n However, note that the data shows an increasing trend? Let's see:\n\n   Day 1 (03-14): min ~5.628, max ~10.974\n   Day 2 (03-15): min ~6.683, max ~10.271\n   Day 3 (03-16): min ~8.371, max ~10.482\n   Day 4 (03-17): min ~6.824, max ~11.326\n\n There is no clear increasing trend. So we can use the average.\n\n But note: the problem says there might be missing values in the data we are given? However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, we can use the hourly average.\n\n Steps for Option 1:\n\n   Step 1: Group the data by hour (i.e., 0,1,...,23) and compute the average for each hour.\n\n   Step 2: For the next 4 days (from 2017-03-18 to 2017-03-21), we assign the average value for each hour.\n\n   However, note: the average might be too smooth and not capture the daily variation? But we are to forecast 4 days, and we have 4 days of history.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-03-17) as a template and adjust by the average of the daily changes? But that might be complex.\n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, the hourly average is a reasonable baseline.\n\n   But let's check the data for each day:\n\n   Hour 0: [6.824, 8.090, 9.286, 9.919] -> average = 8.52975\n   Hour 1: [6.964, 7.386, 9.286, 9.778] -> average = 8.3535\n   ... and so on.\n\n   We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat the same 24-hour average pattern.\n\n   However, note: the pattern might be changing? But we don't have enough data to capture a weekly pattern or trend.\n\n   We'll go with the hourly average.\n\n   But wait: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are given 96 points without missing? So we can compute the average.\n\n   However, if we were to handle missing values, we would have to impute. But the problem says \"be aware of that\", but in this case, we don't have missing in the provided 96.\n\n   So we proceed.\n\n   We'll generate 96 points (4 days * 24 hours) from 2017-03-18 00:00:00 to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n\n   The dates:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-03-18 (Saturday) to 2017-03-21 (Tuesday) -> but we don't have day-of-week information in the pattern? So we ignore.\n\n   We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n   Example for hour 0:\n\n        hour0_avg = (6.824 + 8.090 + 9.286 + 9.919) / 4 = 8.52975\n\n   Similarly for the rest.\n\n   Then:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-03-18): \n            00:00:00 -> hour0_avg\n            01:00:00 -> hour1_avg\n            ... \n            23:00:00 -> hour23_avg\n\n        Day 2 (2017-03-19): same as above, repeat the 24 averages.\n\n        Day 3 (2017-03-20): same\n        Day 4 (2017-03-21): same\n\n   This will give 96 points.\n\n   However, note: the data might have a trend? But we are not accounting for it. Since we only have 4 days, it's hard to model a trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a seasonal naive method: use the last day (2017-03-17) as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n   But the problem: the last day (2017-03-17) has a minimum of 6.824 and maximum of 11.326, but the previous days are different.\n\n   We can also consider a combination: use the average pattern but adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n   However, the problem does not specify the method. We choose the hourly average as a simple and robust method.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (6.824 + 8.090 + 9.286 + 9.919) / 4 = 8.52975\n        hour1: (6.964 + 7.386 + 9.286 + 9.778) / 4 = 8.3535\n        hour2: (6.050 + 7.597 + 8.864 + 9.145) / 4 = 7.914\n        hour3: (5.628 + 6.683 + 8.934 + 8.231) / 4 = 7.369\n        hour4: (6.683 + 7.457 + 8.442 + 8.653) / 4 = 7.80875\n        hour5: (6.261 + 7.035 + 9.004 + 8.020) / 4 = 7.58\n        hour6: (7.175 + 7.597 + 9.215 + 6.824) / 4 = 7.70275\n        hour7: (7.316 + 7.246 + 9.215 + 7.105) / 4 = 7.7205\n        hour8: (7.809 + 6.683 + 8.864 + 7.105) / 4 = 7.61525\n        hour9: (7.527 + 7.105 + 8.371 + 7.175) / 4 = 7.5445\n        hour10: (9.919 + 7.879 + 8.512 + 7.457) / 4 = 8.44175\n        hour11: (8.231 + 7.457 + 8.864 + 7.457) / 4 = 8.00225\n        hour12: (8.934 + 7.668 + 9.215 + 7.738) / 4 = 8.38875\n        hour13: (10.411 + 7.949 + 10.060 + 8.301) / 4 = 9.18025\n        hour14: (10.974 + 8.512 + 10.482 + 8.301) / 4 = 9.56725\n        hour15: (10.130 + 8.301 + 9.989 + 8.723) / 4 = 9.28575\n        hour16: (9.215 + 7.949 + 9.708 + 9.497) / 4 = 9.09225\n        hour17: (9.426 + 8.020 + 9.075 + 9.567) / 4 = 9.022\n        hour18: (10.271 + 7.738 + 9.638 + 10.060) / 4 = 9.42675\n        hour19: (10.552 + 8.020 + 10.060 + 11.326) / 4 = 9.9895\n        hour20: (10.341 + 8.723 + 10.482 + 11.115) / 4 = 10.16525\n        hour21: (10.130 + 10.271 + 10.271 + 10.904) / 4 = 10.394\n        hour22: (8.653 + 9.849 + 10.130 + 9.497) / 4 = 9.53225\n        hour23: (9.145 + 9.497 + 10.130 + 9.778) / 4 = 9.6375\n\n   Then we round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the exact value? The problem doesn't specify. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n   So:\n\n        hour0: 8.530\n        hour1: 8.354\n        hour2: 7.914\n        hour3: 7.369\n        hour4: 7.809\n        hour5: 7.580\n        hour6: 7.703\n        hour7: 7.721\n        hour8: 7.615\n        hour9: 7.545\n        hour10: 8.442\n        hour11: 8.002\n        hour12: 8.389\n        hour13: 9.180\n        hour14: 9.567\n        hour15: 9.286\n        hour16: 9.092\n        hour17: 9.022\n        hour18: 9.427\n        hour19: 9.990\n        hour20: 10.165\n        hour21: 10.394\n        hour22: 9.532\n        hour23: 9.638\n\n   Then we create the next 4 days:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-03-18 00:00:00 -> 8.530\n01:00:00 -> 8.354\n02:00:00 -> 7.914\n03:00:00 -> 7.369\n04:00:00 -> 7.809\n05:00:00 -> 7.580\n06:00:00 -> 7.703\n07:00:00 -> 7.721\n08:00:00 -> 7.615\n09:00:00 -> 7.545\n10:00:00 -> 8.442\n11:00:00 -> 8.002\n12:00:00 -> 8.389\n13:00:00 -> 9.180\n14:00:00 -> 9.567\n15:00:00 -> 9.286\n16:00:00 -> 9.092\n17:00:00 -> 9.022\n18:00:00 -> 9.427\n19:00:00 -> 9.990\n20:00:00 -> 10.165\n21:00:00 -> 10.394\n22:00:00 -> 9.532\n23:00:00 -> 9.638\n\n        Day 2: 2017-03-19: same 24 values\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We'll generate 4 days.\n\n   But note: the dates must be continuous. The last given date is 2017-03-17 23:00:00.\n\n   Next date: 2017-03-18 00:00:00, then 2017-03-18 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-03-21 23:00:00.\n\n   We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   We write the data in the same format: two columns: 'date' and 'OT'\n\n   We must output 96 rows.\n\n   We'll format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n               date     OT\n        2017-03-18 00:00:00  8.530\n        2017-03-18 01:00:00  8.354\n        ... \n        2017-03-21 23:00:00  9.638\n\n   But note: the last day (2017-03-21) at 23:00:00 will be 9.638.\n\n   However, we have 4 days, so the same pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n   But wait: the average we computed is from 4 days, so we are using the same pattern for each day.\n\n   This is a simple and effective method for short-term forecasting when we have multiple seasons.\n\n   We'll output the data.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   So we output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's code the output.\n\n   We'll create a list of dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-03-18 00:00:00.\n\n   Then assign the OT values by hour.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        base_date = 2017-03-18 00:00:00\n        for i in range(96):\n            hour = (i) % 24\n            date = base_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            OT = hourly_avg[hour]   # which we computed above\n\n   We'll format the date as string: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We'll write the data in a tabular form.\n\n   But note: the input had the date as index? We output two columns: 'date' and 'OT'\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        date                OT\n        2017-03-18 00:00:00 8.530\n        ...\n\n   We'll use the same precision (3 decimal places) for OT.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Let's do it.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values? But we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n   We are not given any in the next 96? So we generate without missing.\n\n   We are ready.\n\n   We'll write the answer in the <answer> block.\n\n   Note: We must not omit any content.\n\n   We'll write 96 lines.\n\n   Let me double-check the hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (6.824+8.090+9.286+9.919)/4 = (6.824+8.090=14.914; 14.914+9.286=24.2; 24.2+9.919=34.119) -> 34.119/4 = 8.52975 -> 8.530\n        hour1: (6.964+7.386+9.286+9.778)/4 = (6.964+7.386=14.35; 14.35+9.286=23.636; 23.636+9.778=33.414) -> 33.414/4=8.3535 -> 8.354\n\n   So we round to 3 decimals: 8.354.\n\n   We'll do the same for all.\n\n   We have already computed above.\n\n   Now, we write the data.\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-03-18 00:00:00\n        Then: 2017-03-18 01:00:00, ... until 2017-03-18 23:00:00 -> day1\n        Then 2017-03-19 00:00:00 ... until 2017-03-19 23:00:00 -> day2\n        Then 2017-03-20 00:00:00 ... until 2017-03-20 23:00:00 -> day3\n        Then 2017-03-21 00:00:00 ... until 2017-03-21 23:00:00 -> day4\n\n   So 4 days.\n\n   We'll write the data in a fixed-width format? But the problem did not specify the exact formatting of the table.\n\n   We'll try to align the columns as in the example.\n\n   Example:\n\n        \"2017-03-18 00:00:00  8.530\"\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        \"{date}  {OT:.3f}}\"\n\n   But note: the example input had the OT with 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll output the OT with 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: our computed averages might have more than 3 decimals? We round to 3.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        OT_rounded = round(avg, 3)\n\n   But note: rounding 8.52975 to 3 decimals: 8.530? Yes, because 8.52975 rounded to 3 decimals is 8.530.\n\n   Similarly, 8.914 -> 8.914? But we have 7.914 -> 7.914.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        formatted_OT = format(avg, '.3f')\n\n   This will give 3 decimal places.\n\n   Now, we write the answer.\n\n   We'll create a list of the hourly averages for 24 hours:\n\n        hourly_avgs = [\n            8.530,  # hour0\n            8.354,  # hour1\n            7.914,  # hour2\n            7.369,  # hour3\n            7.809,  # hour4\n            7.580,  # hour5\n            7.703,  # hour6\n            7.721,  # hour7\n            7.615,  # hour8\n            7.545,  # hour9\n            8.442,  # hour10\n            8.002,  # hour11\n            8.389,  # hour12\n            9.180,  # hour13\n            9.567,  # hour14\n            9.286,  # hour15\n            9.092,  # hour16\n            9.022,  # hour17\n            9.427,  # hour18\n            9.990,  # hour19\n            10.165, # hour20\n            10.394, # hour21\n            9.532,  # hour22\n            9.638   # hour23\n        ]\n\n   Then for each of the 96 hours, we do:\n\n        hour_index = i % 24\n        OT = hourly_avgs[hour_index]\n\n   We'll generate the date string:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2017, 3, 18, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + timedelta(hours=i)\n            date_str = current_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n   Then we write: f\"{date_str}  {OT:.3f}\"\n\n   But note: the example input had the OT aligned?
