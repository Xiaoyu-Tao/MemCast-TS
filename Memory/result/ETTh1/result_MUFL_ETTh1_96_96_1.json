        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-07-05 00:00:00 to 2016-07-08 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days: from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. However, we must be cautious for the forecast.\n\n 2. Since the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we might consider:\n    - Seasonal patterns: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours). However, with only 4 days, it's hard to capture weekly patterns.\n\n 3. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n\n 4. But note: the data shows some fluctuations and we have only 96 points. We might also consider using a simple method if the data is not too complex.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but with only 96 points and 96 to forecast, it might be challenging.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a model with:\n    - Trend and daily seasonality.\n\n 7. We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a model that inherently handles seasonality.\n\n 8. We choose to use the Holt-Winters method (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality) because it is designed for hourly data with seasonality and can handle multiple steps.\n\n 9. However, note that the data might have missing values in the future? But the problem says the data we are given has missing values? Actually, the provided data does not have missing values. But we are to forecast the next 96, and we are to provide the complete data for the next 96.\n\n 10. We are to output the next 96 timestamps and their forecasted MUFL values.\n\n 11. Steps in code (if we were to code) would be:\n     - Create a time series object with frequency=24 (hourly data, daily seasonality).\n     - Fit a Holt-Winters model (or ETS model) with additive or multiplicative seasonality? Let's check the data.\n\n 12. But note: we are not coding, we are to simulate the forecast. We must provide the data, so we will generate the next 96 points by using a reasonable method.\n\n 13. Since we cannot run actual code, we will have to rely on a pattern:\n\n     Observing the data:\n        - The values range between about 5.4 and 12.4.\n        - There seems to be a daily pattern: \n            * On 2016-07-05: \n                00:00: 8.777, then 8.955, 8.813, ... and at 23:00: 7.818.\n            * On 2016-07-06: \n                00:00: 6.467, ... 23:00: 10.234.\n            * On 2016-07-07: \n                00:00: 9.204, ... 23:00: 8.884.\n            * On 2016-07-08: \n                00:00: 8.884, ... 23:00: 12.402.\n\n        - The pattern is not very clear, but we see that the load varies by hour.\n\n 14. We can try to compute the average for each hour of the day and then adjust by the overall trend? But we only have 4 days.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-07-08) as a base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n 16. However, the problem requires 96 points and we must provide the complete data.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and without actual computation, we can generate a forecast by:\n\n     - Calculating the hourly averages for the 4 days we have (i.e., for each of the 24 hours, average the 4 days) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that ignores any trend.\n\n     - But we see that the last day (2016-07-08) has a higher value at 23:00 (12.402) than the previous days. So there might be an increasing trend? \n\n 18. We can compute the daily average and see the trend:\n\n        Day 1 (07-05): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day 2: average\n        Day 3: average\n        Day 4: average\n\n     Then project the next 4 days by linear extrapolation? and then apply the hourly profile.\n\n 19. However, the problem is to forecast 96 hours (4 days) without any gap. We must provide 96 points.\n\n 20. Given the constraints, we will generate the next 96 points by:\n\n     a) Calculate the hourly profile (average for each hour of the day) from the 4 days of data.\n\n     b) Calculate the daily average for each of the 4 days and then compute a linear trend for the daily average.\n\n     c) For the next 4 days, project the daily average using the linear trend.\n\n     d) Then for each day, adjust the hourly profile so that the daily average matches the projected daily average.\n\n 21. Steps:\n\n     Step 1: Compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n        hour0_avg = (8.777 + 6.467 + 9.204 + 8.884) / 4\n        ... for each hour.\n\n     Step 2: Compute the daily average for the 4 days:\n\n        day1_avg = average of 24 hours on 2016-07-05\n        day2_avg = average of 24 hours on 2016-07-06\n        day3_avg = average of 24 hours on 2016-07-07\n        day4_avg = average of 24 hours on 2016-07-08\n\n     Step 3: Fit a linear regression to the daily averages (days 1 to 4) to predict the next 4 days.\n\n        Let x = [1,2,3,4] (representing the 4 days)\n        y = [day1_avg, day2_avg, day3_avg, day4_avg]\n\n        Then for day5 (x=5), day6 (x=6), day7 (x=7), day8 (x=8) we get the projected daily average.\n\n     Step 4: For each future day (from day5 to day8) and for each hour in that day:\n\n        forecast = (hourly_avg) * (projected_daily_avg / overall_hourly_avg)\n\n        But note: the overall_hourly_avg is the average of all 96 points? Actually, we can use the average of the 4 daily averages? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        Let T = overall average of the entire 96 points = (day1_avg+day2_avg+day3_avg+day4_avg)/4.\n\n        Then for a future day d with projected daily average = A_d, we can scale the hourly profile by (A_d / T).\n\n     However, this multiplicative scaling might not be the best. Alternatively, we can use an additive adjustment? \n\n     We can do:\n\n        forecast_hour_h_in_day_d = hourly_avg_h + (A_d - T)\n\n     But that additive shift might not be appropriate if the daily average is changing.\n\n 22. Given the simplicity, we are going to use multiplicative scaling to preserve the relative hourly pattern.\n\n 23. But note: the data might have a trend and also the daily pattern. We are capturing the daily pattern in the hourly_avg and the trend in the daily averages.\n\n 24. Let's do a quick calculation for the given data:\n\n     First, compute the hourly averages for each of the 24 hours:\n\n        hour0: (8.777 + 6.467 + 9.204 + 8.884) / 4 = 33.332 / 4 = 8.333\n        hour1: (8.955 + 7.498 + 11.194 + 7.995) / 4 = 35.642 / 4 = 8.9105\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Then, compute the daily averages:\n\n        day1 (2016-07-05): \n            sum = 8.777+8.955+8.813+8.066+7.676+6.823+8.884+7.853+7.462+7.533+8.564+8.742+7.676+6.681+7.320+7.249+6.894+7.924+7.462+7.071+7.285+6.894+6.645+7.818\n            = let's calculate: \n            We can do: \n                8.777+8.955=17.732, +8.813=26.545, +8.066=34.611, +7.676=42.287, +6.823=49.11, +8.884=57.994, +7.853=65.847, +7.462=73.309, +7.533=80.842, +8.564=89.406, +8.742=98.148, +7.676=105.824, \n                +6.681=112.505, +7.320=119.825, +7.249=127.074, +6.894=133.968, +7.924=141.892, +7.462=149.354, +7.071=156.425, +7.285=163.71, +6.894=170.604, +6.645=177.249, +7.818=185.067\n            average = 185.067 / 24 = 7.711125\n\n        day2 (2016-07-06): \n            data: 6.467,7.498,7.818,5.970,6.254,7.853,8.209,9.132,9.346,7.178,8.031,8.671,7.000,7.498,6.965,7.000,7.071,7.640,7.320,6.005,6.254,5.437,7.107,10.234\n            sum = 6.467+7.498=13.965, +7.818=21.783, +5.970=27.753, +6.254=34.007, +7.853=41.86, +8.209=50.069, +9.132=59.201, +9.346=68.547, +7.178=75.725, +8.031=83.756, +8.671=92.427, +7.000=99.427, \n            +7.498=106.925, +6.965=113.89, +7.000=120.89, +7.071=127.961, +7.640=135.601, +7.320=142.921, +6.005=148.926, +6.254=155.18, +5.437=160.617, +7.107=167.724, +10.234=177.958\n            average = 177.958 / 24 = 7.4149166667\n\n        day3 (2016-07-07): \n            data: 9.204,11.194,10.909,11.122,9.204,10.661,11.229,10.803,9.310,8.671,9.808,8.244,6.787,7.391,6.574,6.610,6.538,7.320,7.604,6.858,7.427,7.107,7.356,8.884\n            sum = 9.204+11.194=20.398, +10.909=31.307, +11.122=42.429, +9.204=51.633, +10.661=62.294, +11.229=73.523, +10.803=84.326, +9.310=93.636, +8.671=102.307, +9.808=112.115, +8.244=120.359, +6.787=127.146,\n            +7.391=134.537, +6.574=141.111, +6.610=147.721, +6.538=154.259, +7.320=161.579, +7.604=169.183, +6.858=176.041, +7.427=183.468, +7.107=190.575, +7.356=197.931, +8.884=206.815\n            average = 206.815 / 24 = 8.6172916667\n\n        day4 (2016-07-08): \n            data: 8.884,7.995,8.706,7.747,8.244,9.417,9.737,7.214,6.716,6.894,7.995,8.031,7.356,6.858,6.752,6.574,6.610,7.178,7.107,6.467,7.640,8.244,9.666,12.402\n            sum = 8.884+7.995=16.879, +8.706=25.585, +7.747=33.332, +8.244=41.576, +9.417=50.993, +9.737=60.73, +7.214=67.944, +6.716=74.66, +6.894=81.554, +7.995=89.549, +8.031=97.58, +7.356=104.936,\n            +6.858=111.794, +6.752=118.546, +6.574=125.12, +6.610=131.73, +7.178=138.908, +7.107=146.015, +6.467=152.482, +7.640=160.122, +8.244=168.366, +9.666=178.032, +12.402=190.434\n            average = 190.434 / 24 = 7.93475\n\n        Overall average T = (7.711125 + 7.4149166667 + 8.6172916667 + 7.93475) / 4 = (31.6780833334) / 4 = 7.91952083335\n\n     Step 3: Linear trend for daily averages:\n\n        x = [1,2,3,4]\n        y = [7.711125, 7.4149166667, 8.6172916667, 7.93475]\n\n        We can compute the linear regression:\n\n        n = 4\n        sum_x = 1+2+3+4 = 10\n        sum_y = 7.711125+7.4149166667+8.6172916667+7.93475 = 31.6780833334\n        sum_xy = 1*7.711125 + 2*7.4149166667 + 3*8.6172916667 + 4*7.93475 \n               = 7.711125 + 14.8298333334 + 25.8518750001 + 31.739\n               = 80.1318333335\n        sum_x2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n        slope (b) = (n*sum_xy -

Now we compute the hourly averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n        hour0: (8.777, 6.467, 9.204, 8.884) -> (8.777+6.467+9.204+8.884)/4 = 33.332/4 = 8.333\n        hour1: (8.955, 7.498, 11.194, 7.995) -> 35.642/4 = 8.9105\n        hour2: (8.813, 7.818, 10.909, 8.706) -> 36.246/4 = 9.0615\n        hour3: (8.066, 5.970, 11.122, 7.747) -> 32.905/4 = 8.22625\n        hour4: (7.676, 6.254, 9.204, 8.244) -> 31.378/4 = 7.8445\n        hour5: (6.823, 7.853, 10.661, 9.417) -> 34.754/4 = 8.6885\n        hour6: (8.884, 8.209, 11.229, 9.737) -> 38.059/4 = 9.51475\n        hour7: (7.853, 9.132, 10.803, 7.214) -> 35.002/4 = 8.7505\n        hour8: (7.462, 9.346, 9.310, 6.716) -> 32.834/4 = 8.2085\n        hour9: (7.533, 7.178, 8.671, 6.894) -> 30.276/4 = 7.569\n        hour10: (8.564, 8.031, 9.808, 7.995) -> 34.398/4 = 8.5995\n        hour11: (8.742, 8.671, 8.244, 8.031) -> 33.688/4 = 8.422\n        hour12: (7.676, 7.000, 6.787, 7.356) -> 28.819/4 = 7.20475\n        hour13: (6.681, 7.498, 7.391, 6.858) -> 28.428/4 = 7.107\n        hour14: (7.320, 6.965, 6.574, 6.752) -> 27.611/4 = 6.90275\n        hour15: (7.249, 7.000, 6.610, 6.574) -> 27.433/4 = 6.85825\n        hour16: (6.894, 7.071, 6.538, 6.610) -> 27.113/4 = 6.77825\n        hour17: (7.924, 7.640, 7.320, 7.178) -> 30.062/4 = 7.5155\n        hour18: (7.462, 7.320, 7.604, 7.107) -> 29.493/4 = 7.37325\n        hour19: (7.071, 6.005, 6.858, 6.467) -> 26.401/4 = 6.60025\n        hour20: (7.285, 6.254, 7.427, 7.640) -> 28.606/4 = 7.1515\n        hour21: (6.894, 5.437, 7.107, 8.244) -> 27.682/4 = 6.9205\n        hour22: (6.645, 7.107, 7.356, 9.666) -> 30.774/4 = 7.6935\n        hour23: (7.818, 10.234, 8.884, 12.402) -> 39.338/4 = 9.8345\n\n 26. Now, for the next 96 hours (from 2016-07-09 00:00:00 to 2016-07-12 23:00:00) we have:\n\n        Day5 (2016-07-09): factor = 1.0591\n        Day6 (2016-07-10): factor = 1.0828\n        Day7 (2016-07-11): factor = 1.1065\n        Day8 (2016-07-12): factor = 1.1301\n\n        For each hour in the day, we have 24 hours:\n\n        For example, 2016-07-09 00:00:00: \n            base = 8.333, forecast = 8.333 * 1.0591 \u2248 8.826 (rounded to 3 decimals as in the input)\n\n        We must compute for all 96.\n\n 27. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places. We will round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 28. But wait: the linear trend we computed might not be the best because the daily averages are not strictly linear? \n     We have: day1: 7.711, day2: 7.415, day3: 8.617, day4: 7.935 -> the trend is not strong. But we use it anyway.\n\n 29. We generate the next 96 points:\n\n        Start date: 2016-07-09 00:00:00 (which is the next day after 2016-07-08)\n\n        We'll generate 4 days: 2016-07-09, 2016-07-10, 2016-07-11, 2016-07-12.\n\n        For each day d (from 5 to 8) and for hour h (0 to 23):\n\n            value = hourly_avg[h] * factor[d]\n\n        where factor[5]=1.0591, factor[6]=1.0828, factor[7]=1.1065, factor[8]=1.1301.\n\n 30. We must be cautious: the factors are for the entire day, and we are applying multiplicatively to each hour.\n\n 31. Let's compute the first few:\n\n        Day5 (2016-07-09):\n            hour0: 8.333 * 1.0591 = 8.826 (rounded to 3 decimals: 8.826)\n            hour1: 8.9105 * 1.0591 = 9.437 (rounded: 9.437)\n            hour2: 9.0615 * 1.0591 = 9.598 (rounded: 9.598)\n            hour3: 8.22625 * 1.0591 = 8.713 (rounded: 8.713)\n            hour4: 7.8445 * 1.0591 = 8.310 (rounded: 8.310)\n            ... and so on.\n\n 32. We do this for all 24 hours of day5, then day6, day7, day8.\n\n 33. However, note: the factors are increasing, so the values will be increasing over the next 4 days.\n\n 34. We write the output in the required format.\n\n 35. But note: the user might have missing values in the future? But we are to provide the complete data, so we fill all 96 points.\n\n 36. We generate the next 96 points and output.\n\n 37. Since the calculation is tedious, we will generate the first 5 and last 5 for each day to show the pattern? But the problem requires the entire 96.\n\n 38. We must output all 96.\n\n 39. We'll do the computation and format the output.\n\n 40. However, note: the actual computation of 96 points by hand is error-prone. We are an AI, so we can simulate the computation.\n\n 41.

We note that the last value of the given data was 12.402 (on 2016-07-08 23:00:00) and our forecast for the same hour the next day (2016-07-09 23:00:00) is 10.417, which is a decrease. But our model has a daily increasing trend? However, note that the hourly profile for hour23 is 9.8345 and the factor for day5 is 1.0591, so 9.8345*1.0591=10.417. The previous day's hour23 was 12.402, which is above the average for that hour (which was 9.8345) so it was an outlier? Our model is based on averages and a linear trend of daily averages, so it smooths out.\n\n 48. We provide the forecast as above.\n\n 49. We must note that this is a simple method and in practice, more sophisticated models would be used. But given the constraints, we use this.\n\n 50. We output the entire 96 points.\n",
