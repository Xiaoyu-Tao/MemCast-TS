        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-04-15 00:00:00 to 2017-04-18 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of OT.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are to be aware that the future 96 might have? \n    However, the instruction says: \"these data will have missing values\" - but in the provided past data we don't see any. So we assume the past is complete for modeling.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we need to generate the timestamps and the forecasted OT.\n\n 4. We'll use a time series forecasting method. Given the data shows:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours): we see a pattern repeating every day (temperature rising during the day and falling at night).\n    - Also, there might be a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days so we cannot capture weekly. We can use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n 5. Given the data length is short (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n    - Or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data has a break on 2017-04-17 (a drop in temperature) which might be an anomaly? But we have to forecast based on the pattern.\n\n 7. We'll use a simple model: Seasonal Naive (using the last available season as the forecast) might not be the best because of the anomaly? \n    Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days? But let's try to use a more robust method.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, we can use a model that can handle seasonality and is robust to short series: TBATS or ETS.\n\n 9. But note: we are in a code environment and we have to simulate the forecast. Since we cannot run actual models, we have to generate the forecast by hand? \n    However, the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the data.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the previous days? But we have 4 days. We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n     But that would be a constant pattern for the next 4 days. However, we see a drop on the 17th which might be an anomaly? \n\n 11. Another idea: use the last day (2017-04-18) as the pattern for the next days? But the problem says we must forecast 96 points.\n\n 12. We can do:\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days, but we see that the 17th is an anomaly (with lower temperatures). \n     - Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the anomaly? \n\n 13. Let's break the data into 4 days (each 24 hours). Then for each hour (0 to 23) we compute the median of the 4 days for that hour.\n\n 14. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the median pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 15. Why median? Because on 2017-04-17, the temperatures were lower (anomaly) and we don't want to average that in too much.\n\n 16. Steps for the median method:\n      - Create 24 groups (for each hour of the day)\n      - For group h (0<=h<=23), we have 4 values: from day1, day2, day3, day4 at hour h.\n      - Compute the median for each group.\n\n 17. Then the forecast for the next 4 days will be:\n      Day5: [median(0), median(1), ..., median(23)]\n      Day6: [median(0), median(1), ..., median(23)]\n      Day7: [median(0), median(1), ..., median(23)]\n      Day8: [median(0), median(1), ..., median(23)]\n\n 18. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-04-18. The next day is 2017-04-19, then 20, 21, 22.\n\n 19. How to generate the timestamps?\n      Start from: 2017-04-19 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-04-18 23:00:00) and then 96 hours.\n\n 20. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: [18.431000, 20.823000, 17.587000, 19.205000] -> sort: [17.587, 18.431, 19.205, 20.823] -> median = (18.431+19.205)/2 = 18.818\n      But wait, we have 4 points? Then the median is the average of the two middle ones? Actually, for even number of observations, median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n      However, let's do it properly:\n\n        Hour0: [18.431, 20.823, 17.587, 19.205] -> sorted: [17.587, 18.431, 19.205, 20.823] -> median = (18.431+19.205)/2 = 18.818\n\n      Hour1: [18.009001, 20.893000, 15.617000, 18.642000] -> sorted: [15.617, 18.009, 18.642, 20.893] -> median = (18.009+18.642)/2 = 18.3255\n\n      We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. But note: the data for 2017-04-17 is an anomaly? It might be better to use the last day (2017-04-18) as the base and adjust with the median pattern? \n      However, the problem does not specify the method. We are the expert and we choose a robust method.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the median of the last three days? But the problem says we have 4 days. We'll use all 4.\n\n 23. Let's compute the medians for each hour:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and then compute the median.\n\n      Hour 0: [18.431, 20.823, 17.587, 19.205] -> 18.818\n      Hour 1: [18.009, 20.893, 15.617, 18.642] -> 18.3255\n      Hour 2: [18.22, 20.823, 13.436, 18.501] -> [13.436, 18.22, 18.501, 20.823] -> (18.22+18.501)/2 = 18.3605\n      Hour 3: [18.361, 20.752, 12.451, 17.798] -> [12.451, 17.798, 18.361, 20.752] -> (17.798+18.361)/2 = 18.0795\n      Hour 4: [18.853, 18.501, 8.512, 16.813] -> [8.512, 16.813, 18.501, 18.853] -> (16.813+18.501)/2 = 17.657\n      Hour 5: [18.994, 19.064, 8.301, 17.094] -> [8.301, 17.094, 18.994, 19.064] -> (17.094+18.994)/2 = 18.044\n      Hour 6: [18.15, 19.486, 12.522, 17.024] -> [12.522, 17.024, 18.15, 19.486] -> (17.024+18.15)/2 = 17.587\n      Hour 7: [19.979, 18.783, 14.562, 16.532] -> [14.562, 16.532, 18.783, 19.979] -> (16.532+18.783)/2 = 17.6575\n      Hour 8: [20.33, 19.908, 13.366, 17.024] -> [13.366, 17.024, 19.908, 20.33] -> (17.024+19.908)/2 = 18.466\n      Hour 9: [19.275, 19.416, 12.803, 16.109] -> [12.803, 16.109, 19.275, 19.416] -> (16.109+19.275)/2 = 17.692\n      Hour10: [20.26, 22.652, 14.843, 16.25] -> [14.843, 16.25, 20.26, 22.652] -> (16.25+20.26)/2 = 18.255\n      Hour11: [19.416, 23.426, 15.336, 16.672] -> [15.336, 16.672, 19.416, 23.426] -> (16.672+19.416)/2 = 18.044\n      Hour12: [21.174, 22.089, 15.758, 17.094] -> [15.758, 17.094, 21.174, 22.089] -> (17.094+21.174)/2 = 19.134\n      Hour13: [23.144, 22.23, 17.516, 17.727] -> [17.516, 17.727, 22.23, 23.144] -> (17.727+22.23)/2 = 19.9785\n      Hour14: [24.692, 23.637, 18.994, 19.416] -> [18.994, 19.416, 23.637, 24.692] -> (19.416+23.637)/2 = 21.5265\n      Hour15: [25.395, 22.441, 19.205, 19.979] -> [19.205, 19.979, 22.441, 25.395] -> (19.979+22.441)/2 = 21.21\n      Hour16: [25.536, 22.23, 19.556, 20.471] -> [19.556, 20.471, 22.23, 25.536] -> (20.471+22.23)/2 = 21.3505\n      Hour17: [25.466, 22.23, 20.33, 21.456] -> [20.33, 21.456, 22.23, 25.466] -> (21.456+22.23)/2 = 21.843\n      Hour18: [24.059, 22.581, 20.682, 21.667] -> [20.682, 21.667, 22.581, 24.059] -> (21.667+22.581)/2 = 22.124\n      Hour19: [22.511, 21.456, 21.174, 20.612] -> [20.612, 21.174, 21.456, 22.511] -> (21.174+21.456)/2 = 21.315\n      Hour20: [22.652, 22.652, 20.612, 19.275] -> [19.275, 20.612, 22.652, 22.652] -> (20.612+22.652)/2 = 21.632\n      Hour21: [22.511, 21.878, 20.119, 18.22] -> [18.22, 20.119, 21.878, 22.511] -> (20.119+21.878)/2 = 20.9985\n      Hour22: [21.737, 18.22, 20.33, 20.471] -> [18.22, 20.33, 20.471, 21.737] -> (20.33+20.471)/2 = 20.4005\n      Hour23: [21.174, 16.602, 19.627, 19.416] -> [16.602, 19.416, 19.627, 21.174] -> (19.416+19.627)/2 = 19.5215\n\n 24.

Generate the timestamps:\n      Start: 2017-04-19 00:00:00\n      Then 2017-04-19 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n 26.

Let's recompute the medians and round to 3 decimals:\n\n      Hour0: (18.431+19.205)/2 = 18.818 -> 18.818\n      Hour1: (18.009+18.642)/2 = 18.3255 -> 18.326 (rounded to 3 decimals: 18.3255 -> 18.326? But let's check: 18.3255 is 18.326 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n            Actually, 18.3255 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5 -> round up: 18.326)\n\n      We'll round each median to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimal places without rounding? But the original data had 3. We'll round to 3.\n\n 32. We'll recalc and round:\n\n      Hour0: 18.818 -> 18.818\n      Hour1: 18.3255 -> 18.326\n      Hour2: 18.3605 -> 18.361\n      Hour3: 18.0795 -> 18.080\n      Hour4: 17.657 -> 17.657\n      But 17.657 is already 3 decimals.\n\n      We'll do:\n\n        Hour0: 18.818\n        Hour1: 18.326\n        Hour2: 18.361\n        Hour3: 18.080\n        Hour4: 17.657\n        Hour5: 18.044 -> 18.044 (exactly 18.044, which is 3 decimals)\n        Hour6: 17.587 -> 17.587\n        Hour7: 17.6575 -> 17.658\n        Hour8: 18.466 -> 18.466\n        Hour9: 17.692 -> 17.692\n        Hour10: 18.255 -> 18.255\n        Hour11: 18.044 -> 18.044\n        Hour12: 19.134 -> 19.134\n        Hour13: 19.9785 -> 19.979\n        Hour14: 21.5265 -> 21.527\n        Hour15: 21.21 -> 21.210 (we have to 3 decimals? 21.21 is 21.210?

Now, we generate the next 96 points.\n\n 42. We start at 2017-04-19 00:00:00 and go to 2017-04-22 23:00:00.\n\n 43.
