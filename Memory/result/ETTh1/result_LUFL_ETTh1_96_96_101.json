        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values (we have 24*4=96 points).\n 3. We must choose an appropriate time series forecasting method. Given the data size is small (only 96 points) and we need to forecast 96 points, \n    we can use models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple seasonal naive approach. However, we observe a daily pattern (24-hour cycle).\n\n 4. Observing the data:\n    - There is a clear daily seasonality: the load drops during the night and peaks during the day.\n    - We can try to use a seasonal model. Since the seasonality is 24 hours (as the data is hourly and we see a pattern every 24 points), \n      we can use a seasonal naive method, or if we use ARIMA, we would consider a seasonal component.\n\n 5. However, note that the data only spans 4 days. This is a very short history for fitting a model with daily seasonality (only 4 cycles). \n    Therefore, we might consider a simple approach: \n    - Use the average of the last 4 days for each hour of the day to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 6. Proposed method:\n    - We have 24 hours in a day. We can compute the average for each hour (i.e., average of the 4 values at 00:00, 4 values at 01:00, etc.) \n      and then use that average for the corresponding hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 7. But note: the last day in the data is 2017-08-12. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n 8. Steps to compute:\n    - Group the data by hour of the day (i.e., 0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour across the 4 days.\n    - Then, for the next 4 days, we repeat this hourly average pattern.\n\n 9. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level of the days:\n    Day 1 (2017-08-09): min ~2.3, max ~4.5\n    Day 2 (2017-08-10): min ~2.5, max ~5.3\n    Day 3 (2017-08-11): min ~2.8, max ~5.6\n    Day 4 (2017-08-12): min ~2.4, max ~3.9\n\n    There is no clear increasing or decreasing trend over the 4 days. The max on day 2 and 3 are higher, but then day 4 is lower. \n    Therefore, using the average per hour might be acceptable.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we could use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the level and seasonality. But with only 4 days, \n     the average per hour is a straightforward and robust method.\n\n 11. Implementation:\n     - We have 4 days of data, each day has 24 hours. We can reshape the LUFL into a 4x24 matrix.\n     - Then, for each hour (column), compute the mean (ignoring any NaN if present, but in our case there are none).\n\n 12. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. \n     So we can proceed.\n\n 13. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     hour0: [2.589, 2.589, 3.746, 3.564] -> mean = (2.589+2.589+3.746+3.564)/4 = 3.122\n     hour1: [2.406, 2.741, 3.442, 3.137] -> mean = (2.406+2.741+3.442+3.137)/4 = 2.9315\n     ... and so on.\n\n 14. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will repeat the same 24 hourly averages for each day.\n\n 15. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided history there are none. \n     We are only using the provided 96 points to forecast. Since we are using an average over 4 days, if there had been missing values, \n     we would have to impute them. But in this case, we don't have any.\n\n 16. We'll generate the dates for the next 96 hours starting from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 (the next day after 2017-08-12 23:00:00).\n\n 17. Format: we must output the next 96 dates and the forecasted LUFL value.\n\n 18. Let's code the computation:\n\n     dates: from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00 (inclusive)\n\n     We'll create a list of 24 hourly averages for the 24 hours (0 to 23) from the 4 days of history.\n\n 19. How to compute the average for hour 0 (00:00):\n        hour0 = [2.589 (2017-08-09), 2.589 (2017-08-10), 3.746 (2017-08-11), 3.564 (2017-08-12)]\n\n 20. Similarly for the other hours.\n\n 21. Then, for the first day of forecast (2017-08-13) we use the hourly averages in order: \n        00:00:00 -> average for hour0\n        01:00:00 -> average for hour1\n        ... \n        23:00:00 -> average for hour23\n\n     Then the next day (2017-08-14) we repeat the same 24 averages, and so on for 4 days.\n\n 22. This will give us 96 forecasted values.\n\n 23. We'll round the forecasted values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 24. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll extract the data by hour index.\n\n 25. Steps for computation:\n\n     - Create an array of 24 lists (for hours 0 to 23).\n     - Iterate over the 96 data points and assign each value to the corresponding hour bucket (based on the time of day).\n     - Then compute the mean for each bucket.\n\n 26. Since the data is in order (4 consecutive days, each day 24 hours in order), we can also do:\n\n     data = [2.589, 2.406, ... , 2.437]  (96 values)\n\n     We can reshape into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n 27. Then, for each column j (0 to 23) in the matrix, compute the mean of the_matrix[:, j]\n\n 28. We'll do that.\n\n 29. But note: the data provided is:\n\n        Day0: indices 0-23\n        Day1: indices 24-47\n        Day2: indices 48-71\n        Day3: indices 72-95\n\n 30. So we can reshape the LUFL column into a 4x24 array.\n\n 31. Then, the hourly average for hour j is the mean of [array[0][j], array[1][j], array[2][j], array[3][j]]\n\n 32. We'll compute these 24 averages.\n\n 33. Then, the forecast for the next 4 days is the list of these 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n 34. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n     Start: 2017-08-13 00:00:00\n     Then 2017-08-13 01:00:00, ... until 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n 35. We'll output in the same format: \n        date (as string in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) and the forecasted LUFL value (rounded to 3 decimals).\n\n 36. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We'll write a small code in our mind (or actually we can compute step by step for each hour).\n\n     However, to be efficient, we can do:\n\n        import numpy as np\n\n        # But note: we are not allowed to use code in the final answer? We are to output the data.\n\n        We can compute manually? 24 averages is a bit long, but we can do it.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the data and compute.\n\n 37. We are going to write a program to compute, but since we are an AI, we can simulate:\n\n        data = [2.589, 2.406, 2.315, 2.315, 2.589, 2.955, 3.503, 3.777, 3.868, 3.746, 4.538, 4.264, 3.716, 3.777, 3.868, 3.655, 3.533, 3.564, 3.411, 3.503, 4.356, 3.472, 3.533, 3.015, \n                2.589, 2.741, 2.619, 2.955, 2.894, 2.863, 3.503, 3.320, 3.381, 3.625, 3.777, 4.082, 3.868, 3.716, 3.655, 3.899, 4.051, 3.990, 3.564, 3.716, 5.391, 5.026, 3.838, 4.082, \n                3.746, 3.442, 2.894, 3.229, 3.107, 3.320, 3.716, 4.051, 3.503, 3.868, 4.417, 4.630, 4.538, 4.843, 4.173, 4.234, 3.868, 4.508, 3.686, 4.508, 5.604, 4.843, 4.173, 3.777, \n                3.564, 3.137, 2.955, 2.833, 2.863, 3.015, 3.807, 3.625, 3.777, 3.381, 3.960, 3.746, 3.290, 3.046, 3.259, 3.046, 3.168, 3.533, 3.168, 3.198, 3.411, 3.137, 2.680, 2.437]\n\n        Reshape to 4 rows, 24 columns.\n\n        row0 = [2.589, 2.406, 2.315, 2.315, 2.589, 2.955, 3.503, 3.777, 3.868, 3.746, 4.538, 4.264, 3.716, 3.777, 3.868, 3.655, 3.533, 3.564, 3.411, 3.503, 4.356, 3.472, 3.533, 3.015]\n        row1 = [2.589, 2.741, 2.619, 2.955, 2.894, 2.863, 3.503, 3.320, 3.381, 3.625, 3.777, 4.082, 3.868, 3.716, 3.655, 3.899, 4.051, 3.990, 3.564, 3.716, 5.391, 5.026, 3.838, 4.082]\n        row2 = [3.746, 3.442, 2.894, 3.229, 3.107, 3.320, 3.716, 4.051, 3.503, 3.868, 4.417, 4.630, 4.538, 4.843, 4.173, 4.234, 3.868, 4.508, 3.686, 4.508, 5.604, 4.843, 4.173, 3.777]\n        row3 = [3.564, 3.137, 2.955, 2.833, 2.863, 3.015, 3.807, 3.625, 3.777, 3.381, 3.960, 3.746, 3.290, 3.046, 3.259, 3.046, 3.168, 3.533, 3.168, 3.198, 3.411, 3.137, 2.680, 2.437]\n\n        Now, for each column (0 to 23), compute the mean.\n\n        hour0: (2.589 + 2.589 + 3.746 + 3.564) / 4 = (2.589+2.589=5.178; 5.178+3.746=8.924; 8.924+3.564=12.488) -> 12.488/4 = 3.122\n        hour1: (2.406+2.741+3.442+3.137)/4 = (2.406+2.741=5.147; 5.147+3.442=8.589; 8.589+3.137=11.726) -> 11.726/4 = 2.9315 -> 2.932 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        We'll do this for all.\n\n 38.
