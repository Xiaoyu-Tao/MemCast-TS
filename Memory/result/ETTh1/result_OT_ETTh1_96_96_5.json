        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2016-07-21 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours = 96).\n\n 2. We must handle missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided sample there are none. \n    So for the given 96 points we don't see missing values, but we are to be cautious.\n\n 3. Since we are to forecast 96 points, we can use a time series model. Given the hourly data and the apparent seasonality (daily pattern),\n    we can consider a model that captures seasonality. However, we have only 4 days of data to base our forecast on, which is very limited.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we are not provided with any other variables (like load) and the data is univariate, we will use a simple model.\n\n 5. We note that the data shows:\n    - Daily seasonality: the temperature rises during the day and falls at night.\n    - There might be a slight upward trend in the last two days? But with only 4 days, it's hard to tell.\n\n 6. We can use a seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the last day. However, the problem says the data has missing values, \n    but in the provided data there are none. So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model with seasonality. \n    But with only 4 days, the seasonality period is 24, and we have 4 seasons. This is very limited for fitting a seasonal model.\n\n 8. Given the challenge, we might use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? Or we can use the last available day (day 4) as the forecast.\n\n 9. However, the problem says \"be aware of missing values\", but in the provided data there are none. So for the purpose of forecasting, \n    we will assume the given data is complete and then generate the next 96 points.\n\n 10. We decide to use a seasonal naive forecast: \n     We will take the pattern of the last day (2016-07-24) and repeat it for the next 4 days? \n     But note: we are to forecast 96 hours (4 days). So we can repeat the last day (which is 24 hours) 4 times.\n\n     However, the last day we have is 2016-07-24. Then the next day starts at 2016-07-25 00:00:00.\n\n     But let's check: \n        The last point is 2016-07-24 23:00:00 -> 40.098000\n        Then we would use the data from 2016-07-24 00:00:00 to 2016-07-24 23:00:00 and repeat it for the next 4 days.\n\n 11. But note: the data of 2016-07-24 might be different from the previous days? We see that the temperature on 2016-07-24 is generally higher than the previous days.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for each of the next 4 days? \n     However, the problem says we must forecast the next 96 points, and we are to provide the complete data.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have very limited data, we choose the seasonal naive method using the last day (2016-07-24) as the pattern.\n\n     Forecast for:\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00: same as 2016-07-24 00:00:00 -> 38.269001\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00: same as 2016-07-24 01:00:00 -> 38.409000\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Then we repeat the same 24-hour pattern for 4 days.\n\n 14. However, we must generate 96 points. The last day we have is 2016-07-24, so:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-07-25 -> same as 2016-07-24\n        Day 2: 2016-07-26 -> same as 2016-07-24\n        Day 3: 2016-07-27 -> same as 2016-07-24\n        Day 4: 2016-07-28 -> same as 2016-07-24\n\n 15. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, we are only given 96 points without missing values. \n     And we are to forecast the next 96. We are not asked to impute the given data.\n\n 16. We generate the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-07-25 00:00:00\n        End: 2016-07-28 23:00:00\n\n     We can generate the dates by adding 1 hour each time.\n\n 17. The values: we take the 24 values from 2016-07-24 and repeat them 4 times.\n\n 18. Let's extract the values for 2016-07-24:\n\n        date                OT\n        2016-07-24 00:00:00 38.269001\n        2016-07-24 01:00:00 38.409000\n        2016-07-24 02:00:00 37.636002\n        2016-07-24 03:00:00 37.847000\n        2016-07-24 04:00:00 37.636002\n        2016-07-24 05:00:00 37.706001\n        2016-07-24 06:00:00 38.339001\n        2016-07-24 07:00:00 40.730999\n        2016-07-24 08:00:00 42.418999\n        2016-07-24 09:00:00 42.630001\n        2016-07-24 10:00:00 40.520000\n        2016-07-24 11:00:00 39.957001\n        2016-07-24 12:00:00 38.127998\n        2016-07-24 13:00:00 39.957001\n        2016-07-24 14:00:00 41.575001\n        2016-07-24 15:00:00 44.178001\n        2016-07-24 16:00:00 44.459000\n        2016-07-24 17:00:00 45.444000\n        2016-07-24 18:00:00 45.091999\n        2016-07-24 19:00:00 41.997002\n        2016-07-24 20:00:00 40.520000\n        2016-07-24 21:00:00 40.379002\n        2016-07-24 22:00:00 39.745998\n        2016-07-24 23:00:00 40.098000\n\n 19. We will repeat these 24 values 4 times to get 96 values.\n\n 20. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-07-25 00:00:00 to 2016-07-25 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2016-07-26 00:00:00 to 2016-07-26 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2016-07-27 00:00:00 to 2016-07-27 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2016-07-28 00:00:00 to 2016-07-28 23:00:00\n\n 21. We must output the data in the same format: two columns \"date\" and \"OT\", and the OT values with 6 decimal places? \n     The given data has 6 decimal places, but we see they are floats. We'll output with the same precision.\n\n 22. However, note: the problem says \"complete data\", meaning we must not omit any of the 96 forecasted points.\n\n 23. We write the forecasted data in the required format.\n\n 24. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the training data, and we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n 25. We output the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\ndate,OT\n2016-07-25 00:00:00,38.269001\n2016-07-25 01:00:00,38.409000\n... (all 96 lines)\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 26. However, the example input had a space after the comma? Actually, the example input was:\n\n        \"2016-07-21 00:00:00 34.891998\"\n\n     But in the provided data, it was shown with a space. But the format we are to output is not specified. \n     The example input was printed with a space, but the user said the data has two columns: \"date\" and \"OT\".\n\n     We'll output as: \n        \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,OT_value\"\n\n     with 6 decimal places for OT_value? The original data had 6 decimal places, but note that the numbers are floats and might have less.\n\n     We'll output the exact numbers as in the last day, repeated.\n\n 27. Let's code the repetition:\n\n        base_day = [38.269001, 38.409000, 37.636002, 37.847000, 37.636002, 37.706001, \n                   38.339001, 40.730999, 42.418999, 42.630001, 40.520000, 39.957001, \n                   38.127998, 39.957001, 41.575001, 44.178001, 44.459000, 45.444000, \n                   45.091999, 41.997002, 40.520000, 40.379002, 39.745998, 40.098000]\n\n        Then the forecast = base_day * 4\n\n 28. Generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2016, 7, 25, 0, 0, 0)\n        Then for 96 hours, we add 1 hour each time.\n\n 29. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 30. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 31. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 32. But wait: is the seasonal naive the best? We have 4 days of data. We could average the same hour of the 4 days? \n     For example, for 00:00:00, we have:\n\n        Day1: 34.891998\n        Day2: 36.651001\n        Day3: 36.651001\n        Day4: 38.269001\n\n        Average = (34.891998 + 36.651001 + 36.651001 + 38.269001) / 4 = 36.61575\n\n     Then use that average for the next 4 days at 00:00:00? \n\n     However, we see an increasing trend? So the average might be lower than the last day.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use the last day because it might be the most recent pattern and the temperature might be increasing.\n\n 33. Given the limited data and the fact that we don't have a strong model, we stick to the seasonal naive using the last day.\n\n 34. We generate the data accordingly.\n\n 35. Code for generating the dates and the values:\n\n        base_day = [\n            38.269001, 38.409000, 37.636002, 37.847000, 37.636002, 37.706001,\n            38.339001, 40.730999, 42.418999, 42.630001, 40.520000, 39.957001,\n            38.127998, 39.957001, 41.575001, 44.178001, 44.459000, 45.444000,\n            45.091999, 41.997002, 40.520000, 40.379002, 39.745998, 40.098000\n        ]\n\n        dates = []\n        start_date = datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 25, 0, 0, 0)\n        for i in range(96):\n            current_date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(hours=i)\n            dates.append(current_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n        values = base_day * 4   # 24 * 4 = 96\n\n 36. Then we output each date and the corresponding value.\n\n 37. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 38. Note: the problem says the dataset is sampled hourly, so we are generating hourly.\n\n 39. We output:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-07-25 00:00:00,38.269001\n2016-07-25 01:00:00,38.409000\n2016-07-25 02:00:00,37.636002\n... (until 2016-07-28 23:00:00)\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 40. We must be precise with the dates.\n\n 41. Let's do the first day:\n\n        2016-07-25 00:00:00 -> base_day[0]\n        2016-07-25 01:00:00 -> base_day[1]\n        ...\n        2016-07-25 23:00:00 -> base_day[23]\n\n        Then 2016-07-26 00:00:00 -> base_day[0]\n        ... until 2016-07-28 23:00:00 -> base_day[23] (the last value)\n\n 42. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 43. We note that the last day of the input was 2016-07-24, so the next day is 2016-07-25.\n\n 44. We output the 96 lines.\n\n 45. Since we are to provide the complete data, we output all 96.\n\n 46. We write the answer in the required format.\n",
