        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle UseFul Load) from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of MUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing entries. We assume that the provided data is complete for the past 96 points.\n\n 3. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data is hourly and we are to forecast 96 steps, we can consider:\n    - The data shows daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not evident).\n    - We can use a model that captures seasonality, such as SARIMA, or a more advanced model like Prophet or LSTM. However, we are limited by the data length (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we can use a simple model that can capture the daily seasonality. Since we have only 4 days, we might use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or use a simple seasonal naive model? But the data does not look like a simple seasonal pattern.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like ARIMA with automatic parameter selection. However, with only 96 points, we can try to fit a SARIMA model with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24).\n\n 6. Steps for SARIMA:\n    - We need to check for stationarity and seasonality. The data has a clear daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours) and also a trend? The values on 2017-08-11 are generally higher than the previous days? But we have only 4 days, so it's hard to tell.\n\n 7. Given the small data, we can try:\n    - SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[24] \n    - We can use auto_arima from pmdarima to select the best parameters? But we are not allowed to run code, so we have to rely on a pre-defined method.\n\n 8. However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided 96 points, we don't see any, but for the next 96 we are to forecast, we must provide complete data. So we are only forecasting, and if there are missing values in the provided data we would have to impute, but the provided data is complete.\n\n 9. Since we are in a simulated environment and cannot run actual code, we have to generate a forecast in a systematic way.\n\n 10. We can use a simple method: \n     - Calculate the average pattern for the 4 days we have and then project that pattern forward? But the level might be increasing or decreasing.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters). The Holt-Winters method can be applied to data with seasonality and trend.\n\n 12. Given the data, we observe:\n     - The data has a daily cycle: \n        - During the day (from 00:00 to 23:00) the load goes through a pattern: \n          - It starts at a certain level, then decreases in the morning (around 7-10 AM) to negative values, then increases in the afternoon and evening.\n\n 13. We can try to model the trend and seasonality separately.\n\n 14. However, without actual computation, we have to simulate a forecast. We are expected to provide 96 numbers.\n\n 15. Since the problem does not specify the method, we choose a method that is reasonable.\n\n 16. We note that the data has:\n      - A daily seasonality of 24 hours.\n      - A possible upward trend? Let's see the average per day:\n          Day 1 (2017-08-09): average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n          Day 2: 2017-08-10: average\n          Day 3: 2017-08-11: average\n          Day 4: 2017-08-12: average\n\n     We can calculate the daily averages (if we had the data) but we don't have the exact numbers, but we can see the values are increasing? \n\n     However, we are not to do manual calculations. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n 17. We decide to use a naive seasonal forecast: \n        y_{t+96} = y_t   for t in the last 24 hours? But that would be the same as the last day? \n\n     But the problem says we have 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast the next 96 (4 days). We can use the last day (day 4) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n     However, we see that the level of the time series is changing. The first day (2017-08-09) has a maximum of 8.422 and minimum of -6.290, the second day has a maximum of 9.985 and minimum of -14.960, the third day has maximum 12.615 and minimum -12.970, and the fourth day has maximum 9.808 and minimum -0.888? \n\n     So the pattern is not stable.\n\n 18. We can use the average of the four days for each hour? \n\n     For example, for hour 00:00: \n        value1 = 8.386 (2017-08-09 00:00)\n        value2 = 8.031 (2017-08-10 00:00)\n        value3 = 12.153 (2017-08-11 00:00)\n        value4 = 9.808 (2017-08-12 00:00)\n\n     average = (8.386+8.031+12.153+9.808)/4 = 9.5945\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we set the 00:00 of each day to 9.5945? But that would be constant. We might want to account for a trend.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-12) and adjust it by the average change from day to day? \n\n     But we only have 4 days, we can compute a linear trend for the daily averages and then project the next 4 days.\n\n 20. Steps for a simple forecast:\n\n     a) Compute the daily average for each of the 4 days.\n        Day1: 2017-08-09: avg1\n        Day2: 2017-08-10: avg2\n        Day3: 2017-08-11: avg3\n        Day4: 2017-08-12: avg4\n\n     b) Fit a linear regression: day index (1,2,3,4) vs (avg1, avg2, avg3, avg4) to get a trend.\n\n     c) For the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8), compute the projected daily average.\n\n     d) For each hour in the day, compute the average seasonal component (the deviation from the daily mean) over the 4 days.\n\n        For hour h: \n            seasonal_h = ( (value1_h - avg1) + (value2_h - avg2) + (value3_h - avg3) + (value4_h - avg4) ) / 4\n\n     e) Then for a future day i (i=5,6,7,8) and hour h:\n            forecast = trend_i + seasonal_h\n\n 21. However, we are not to do manual calculations. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n 22. Given the complexity and without actual computation, we can use a simpler method: \n        - Use the last day (2017-08-12) as the base pattern, and then adjust the level by the average of the last two days? \n\n 23. But note: the problem requires 96 points. We are to forecast from 2017-08-13 00:00:00 to 2017-08-16 23:00:00.\n\n 24. We decide to use the average of the last two days (day3 and day4) for each hour? \n\n     For hour 00:00: (12.153 + 9.808)/2 = 10.9805\n     For hour 01:00: (12.615 + 8.173)/2 = 10.394\n     ... and then use that pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n     But that would be constant for the next 4 days? \n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day4) and then add a drift (trend) component. The trend can be the average daily increase.\n\n     The daily averages:\n        day1: let's compute quickly (approximately): \n            day1: positive and negative values, average around (8.386+8.422+...+7.924)/24 -> we don't have time to compute exactly.\n\n 26. Given the constraints, we will generate a forecast by repeating the last day's pattern (day4) for the next 4 days? \n\n     But the level of the time series might be increasing? \n\n     We can adjust by the trend of the daily means. \n\n     We compute the daily means:\n\n        Day1 (2017-08-09): \n            sum = 8.386+8.422+8.244+8.244+7.498+7.960+7.143+5.757+6.041+3.305+2.452-6.290-4.477-2.736-3.020+0.995+0.533+0.000+4.442+4.939+6.432+5.792+5.437+6.432\n            = let's approximate: \n                positive: 8.386+8.422+8.244+8.244+7.498+7.960+7.143+5.757+6.041+4.442+4.939+6.432+5.792+5.437+6.432+0.995+0.533+4.442? \n                negative: -6.290-4.477-2.736-3.020\n            positive sum approx: 8.4*3=25.2, 8.24*2=16.48, 7.5+7.96+7.14=22.6, 5.76+6.04=11.8, 3.3+2.45=5.75, then 4.44+4.94+6.43+5.79+5.44+6.43= 33.47, and 1.0+0.53=1.53 -> total positive ~ 25.2+16.48+22.6+11.8+5.75+33.47+1.53 = 116.83\n            negative: -6.29-4.48-2.74-3.02 = -16.53\n            total = 116.83 - 16.53 = 100.3 -> average = 100.3/24 = 4.18\n\n        Day2: \n            positive: 8.031+8.635+6.965+7.356+7.036+8.066+5.863+5.437+5.934+8.457+9.914+9.061+9.985+0.107 -> wait, we have negative too: -3.020, -8.884, -11.549, -11.655, -14.960, -14.676, -12.189, -8.742, -5.508\n            positive sum: 8.0+8.6+7.0+7.4+7.0+8.1+5.9+5.4+5.9+8.5+9.9+9.1+10.0+0.1 = 8+8.6=16.6, 7+7.4=14.4, 7+8.1=15.1, 5.9+5.4=11.3, 5.9+8.5=14.4, 9.9+9.1=19, 10.0+0.1=10.1 -> total=16.6+14.4+15.1+11.3+14.4+19+10.1=100.9\n            negative: -3.0-8.9-11.5-11.7-15.0-14.7-12.2-8.7-5.5 = - (3+8.9=11.9, 11.5+11.7=23.2, 15.0+14.7=29.7, 12.2+8.7=20.9, 5.5) -> total negative = 11.9+23.2+29.7+20.9+5.5 = 91.2\n            total = 100.9 - 91.2 = 9.7 -> average = 9.7/24 = 0.404\n\n        This does not look consistent. \n\n 27.
