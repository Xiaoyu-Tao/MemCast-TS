        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2017-01-29 00:00:00 to 2017-02-01 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour cycle) and also some missing values? But in the provided data, there are no missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be prepared. But in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing. So we assume the given 96 are complete.\n\n 2. We will use a time series model that can handle the seasonality. Since the data is hourly and we have a daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 3. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use a simple but effective model like Seasonal Naive, or perhaps Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA).\n\n 4. However, note that the data for 2017-01-31 is constant (-1.340 for all 24 hours). This might be an anomaly or missing data? But it is provided. We must consider that the data might have anomalies.\n\n 5. We'll use an automated approach to select the best model. But since we are to provide a complete forecast, we must generate 96 values.\n\n 6. We'll use the following approach:\n    - We'll use the last 96 points to build a model.\n    - We'll use a model that can capture seasonality. Given the data has a clear daily pattern, we set seasonal period to 24.\n\n 7. We choose to use SARIMA because it is flexible. We will use auto_arima to find the best parameters.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive method: \n        y_{t+1} = y_{t-23}   (because 24 hours before, same hour of previous day)\n    But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly repeating. For example, the first day (2017-01-29) and the next day (2017-01-30) are similar but not identical.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the need for accuracy, we will use an automated SARIMA model.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. But in the provided 96 points, there are none. So we can proceed.\n\n But since we are to forecast 96 points, and the data is hourly, we can use:\n\n    Model: SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[24]\n\n 10. We'll use pmdarima's auto_arima to find the best parameters.\n\n But note: we are in a simulated environment and cannot run code. So we must rely on a precomputed model or a heuristic.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n      - We observe that the data has a daily cycle and a downward trend? But the 4 days do not show a clear trend. \n      - We can decompose the series and then forecast.\n\n However, without running code, we must simulate the forecast.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we will use a simple average of the last two days to forecast the next days? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 13. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the previous days. We have 4 days of data. We can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But note the data for 2017-01-31 is constant and might be an outlier.\n\n 14. Let's look at the data:\n\n      Day 1 (29th): 24 values\n      Day 2 (30th): 24 values\n      Day 3 (31st): 24 values (all -1.340) -> this is suspicious, maybe missing data? But we are told to be aware of missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't have missing. So we must use it.\n\n      Day 4 (1st): 24 values\n\n 15. We can we handle the constant day? It might be an anomaly. We might consider replacing that day with the average of the other days? But the problem says we must be aware of missing values, but doesn't say to impute. However, for forecasting, we have to use the data as is.\n\n 16. We decide to use the entire data without imputation because the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are none. The constant day is given and we must use it.\n\n 17. We will use a SARIMA model. Since we cannot run code, we have to rely on a standard model. We note that the series has:\n\n      - A seasonal period of 24.\n      - The data does not show a strong trend (it fluctuates around a level).\n\n 18. We can try a model: SARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[24] -> which is equivalent to a seasonal random walk.\n\n      Forecast for the same hour in the next day = last observed value for that hour.\n\n      But we have 4 days, so we can use the last day (Feb 1st) as the pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n      However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 points (4 days). So we can use:\n\n        Day 5 (Feb 2) = Day 4 (Feb 1) \n        Day 6 (Feb 3) = Day 4 (Feb 1) \n        Day 7 (Feb 4) = Day 4 (Feb 1) \n        Day 8 (Feb 5) = Day 4 (Feb 1) \n\n      But that would be repeating the same day 4 times. However, the pattern of Feb 1 is:\n\n        -1.541, -1.741, -1.875, -2.009, -2.076, -1.942, -2.009, -1.875, -1.139, -1.273, -1.474, -1.407, -1.273, -1.407, -1.340, -1.340, -1.139, -1.072, -1.340, -0.268, -0.067, 0.000, -0.335, -1.072\n\n      But note: the data on Jan 29, 30, and 31 are different. So repeating the last day might not be the best.\n\n 19. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the 4 days we have. But the 31st is constant and might pull the average down.\n\n      For example, for 00:00: \n        Jan29: -1.875, Jan30: -1.875, Jan31: -1.340, Feb01: -1.541 -> average = (-1.875 -1.875 -1.340 -1.541)/4 = -1.65775\n\n      Then we do that for each hour and then repeat that average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. However, the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not told to impute, but for forecasting we need a complete set. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we can use them.\n\n 21. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days to form a typical day, and then use that typical day for the next 4 days.\n\n 22. Steps for the typical day:\n\n        hour0: ( -1.875 + (-1.875) + (-1.340) + (-1.541) ) / 4 = (-6.631)/4 = -1.65775\n        hour1: ( -2.009 + (-2.009) + (-1.340) + (-1.741) ) / 4 = (-7.099)/4 = -1.77475\n        ... and so on.\n\n 23. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day5 (Feb2): [h0_avg, h1_avg, ..., h23_avg]\n        Day6 (Feb3): [h0_avg, h1_avg, ...]\n        Day7 (Feb4): [h0_avg, ...]\n        Day8 (Feb5): [h0_avg, ...]\n\n 24. But note: the data on Jan31 is constant and might be an anomaly. We might consider using the median? or excluding that day? \n\n      However, the problem does not to alter the given data. So we use the mean.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the median for each hour to avoid the effect of the constant day? \n\n      For hour0: \n          values: -1.875, -1.875, -1.340, -1.541 -> sorted: -1.875, -1.875, -1.541, -1.340 -> median = (-1.875 -1.541)/2 = -1.708\n\n      But the median might be better because the constant day is an outlier.\n\n 26. We decide to use the median for each hour over the 4 days to form the typical day.\n\n 27. Let's compute the median for each hour (00 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n      We have 4 days: \n        Day1: 2017-01-29 (index 0-23)\n        Day2: 2017-01-30 (index 24-47)\n        Day3: 2017-01-31 (index 48-71) -> all -1.340\n        Day4: 2017-02-01 (index 72-95)\n\n      We'll group by hour of day.\n\n      Hour 0 (00:00): \n          Day1: -1.875\n          Day2: -1.875\n          Day3: -1.340\n          Day4: -1.541\n          Sorted: -1.875, -1.875, -1.541, -1.340 -> median = (-1.875 + -1.541)/2 = -1.708\n\n      Hour 1 (01:00):\n          Day1: -2.009\n          Day2: -2.009\n          Day3: -1.340\n          Day4: -1.741\n          Sorted: -2.009, -2.009, -1.741, -1.340 -> median = (-2.009 + -1.741)/2 = -1.875\n\n      Hour 2 (02:00):\n          Day1: -2.076\n          Day2: -2.143\n          Day3: -1.340\n          Day4: -1.875\n          Sorted: -2.143, -2.076, -1.875, -1.340 -> median = (-2.076 + -1.875)/2 = -1.9755\n\n      ... and so on.\n\n 28. This is very time-consuming by hand. We need a programmatic way? But we are an AI, so we can compute.\n\n 29. However, we are to provide the forecast without running code? We must simulate.\n\n 30. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the exact 96 numbers, we decide to use the median method.\n\n 31. We will compute the median for each of the 24 hours and then repeat that pattern for 4 days.\n\n 32. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: [-1.875, -1.875, -1.340, -1.541] -> median = (-1.875 + -1.541)/2 = -1.708\n      Hour 1: [-2.009, -2.009, -1.340, -1.741] -> median = (-2.009 + -1.741)/2 = -1.875\n      Hour 2: [-2.076, -2.143, -1.340, -1.875] -> sorted: [-2.143, -2.076, -1.875, -1.340] -> median = (-2.076 + -1.875)/2 = -1.9755\n      Hour 3: [-2.210, -2.210, -1.340, -2.009] -> sorted: [-2.210, -2.210, -2.009, -1.340] -> median = (-2.210 + -2.009)/2 = -2.1095\n      Hour 4: [-2.210, -2.277, -1.340, -2.076] -> sorted: [-2.277, -2.210, -2.210, -2.076, -1.340] -> wait, we have 4 values: \n            [-2.277, -2.210, -2.210, -2.076] -> median = (-2.210 + -2.210)/2 = -2.210\n      Actually, for even number of observations, we take the average of the two middle ones.\n\n      Let me recompute hour4: \n          Values: \n            Day1: -2.210\n            Day2: -2.277\n            Day3: -1.340\n            Day4: -2.076\n          Sorted: [-2.277, -2.210, -2.210, -2.076] -> no, wait: \n          Correction: \n            Day1: -2.210\n            Day2: -2.277 -> that's the value at 04:00 on Jan30? \n            But the hour4 is the 4th hour of the day, which is 04:00.\n\n          So: \n            Jan29 04:00: -2.210\n            Jan30 04:00: -2.277\n            Jan31 04:00: -1.340\n            Feb01 04:00: -2.076\n\n          Sorted: -2.277, -2.210, -2.076, -1.340 -> the two middle: -2.210 and -2.076 -> median = (-2.210 -2.076)/2 = -2.143\n\n      Hour 5: \n          Jan29: -2.210\n          Jan30: -2.344\n          Jan31: -1.340\n          Feb01: -1.942\n          Sorted: -2.344, -2.210, -1.942, -1.340 -> median = (-2.210 + -1.942)/2 = -2.076\n\n      Hour 6:\n          Jan29: -2.143\n          Jan30: -2.143\n          Jan31: -1.340\n          Feb01: -2.009\n          Sorted: -2.143, -2.143, -2.009, -1.340 -> median = (-2.143 + -2.009)/2 = -2.076\n\n      Hour 7:\n          Jan29: -2.009\n          Jan30: -1.942\n          Jan31: -1.340\n          Feb01: -1.875\n          Sorted: -2.009, -1.942, -1.875, -1.340 -> median = (-1.942 + -1.875)/2 = -1.9085\n\n      Hour 8:\n          Jan29: -1.340\n          Jan30: -1.005\n          Jan31: -1.340\n          Feb01: -1.139\n          Sorted: -1.340, -1.340, -1.139, -1.005 -> median = (-1.340 + -1.139)/2 = -1.2395\n\n      Hour 9:\n          Jan29: -1.741\n          Jan30: -1.938?

Now we have the median for each hour:\n\n        hour0: -1.708\n        hour1: -1.875\n        hour2: -1.9755\n        hour3: -2.1095\n        hour4: -2.143\n        hour5: -2.076\n        hour6: -2.076\n        hour7: -1.9085\n        hour8: -1.2395\n        hour9: -1.407\n        hour10: -1.407\n        hour11: -1.3735\n        hour12: -1.3065\n        hour13: -1.3735\n        hour14: -1.340\n        hour15: -1.340\n        hour16: -1.3065\n        hour17: -1.507\n        hour18: -1.273\n        hour19: -0.402\n        hour20: -0.2345\n        hour21: -0.3685\n        hour22: -0.737\n        hour23: -1.1725\n\n 34. We then create the next 4 days by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 35. The next 96 points (from 2017-02-02 00:00:00 to 2017-02-05 23:00:00) will be:\n\n        Day1 (Feb02): [ -1.708, -1.875, -1.9755, -2.1095, -2.143, -2.076, -2.076, -1.9085, -1.2395, -1.407, -1.407, -1.3735, -1.3065, -1.3735, -1.340, -1.340, -1.3065, -1.507, -1.273, -0.402, -0.2345, -0.3685, -0.737, -1.1725 ]\n\n        Day2 (Feb03): same as above\n        Day3 (Feb04): same\n        Day4 (Feb05): same\n\n 36. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but we are forecasting without any missing? We are to provide the complete data.\n\n 37. We output the next 96 points in the same format.\n\n 38. However, the problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"mustn't omit any content\". So we output 96 lines.\n\n 39. We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-02-02 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-02-01 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-02-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-02-05 23:00:00.\n\n 40. We write the data in the same format: \n        date and time in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", then the HULL value (with 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places, but we computed with more. We'll round to 3 decimals.)\n\n 41. We computed with more precision, but we'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 42. Let's round the medians to 3 decimal places:\n\n        hour0: -1.708 -> -1.708\n        hour1: -1.875 -> -1.875\n        hour2: -1.9755 -> -1.976\n        hour3: -2.1095 -> -2.110\n        hour4: -2.143 -> -2.143\n        hour5: -2.076 -> -2.076\n        hour6: -2.076 -> -2.076\n        hour7: -1.9085 -> -1.909\n        hour8: -1.2395 -> -1.240\n        hour9: -1.407 -> -1.407\n        hour10: -1.407 -> -1.407\n        hour11: -1.3735 -> -1.374\n        hour12: -1.3065 -> -1.307\n        hour13: -1.3735 -> -1.374\n        hour14: -1.340 -> -1.340\n        hour15: -1.340 -> -1.340\n        hour16: -1.3065 -> -1.307\n        hour17: -1.507 -> -1.507\n        hour18: -1.273 -> -1.273\n        hour19: -0.402 -> -0.402\n        hour20: -0.2345 -> -0.234\n        hour21: -0.3685 -> -0.368\n        hour22: -0.737 -> -0.737\n        hour23: -1.1725 -> -1.172\n\n 43. Now we create the 4 days:\n\n        Day1: 2017-02-02 00:00:00 -> -1.708\n               2017-02-02 01:00:00 -> -1.875\n               2017-02-02 02:00:00 -> -1.976\n               2017-02-02 03:00:00 -> -2.110\n               2017-02-02 04:00:00 -> -2.143\n               2017-02-02 05:00:00 -> -2.076\n               2017-02-02 06:00:00 -> -2.076\n               2017-02-02 07:00:00 -> -1.909\n               2017-02-02 08:00:00 -> -1.240\n               2017-02-02 09:00:00 -> -1.407\n               2017-02-02 10:00:00 -> -1.407\n               2017-02-02 11:00:00 -> -1.374\n               2017-02-02 12:00:00 -> -1.307\n               2017-02-02 13:00:00 -> -1.374\n               2017-02-02 14:00:00 -> -1.340\n               2017-02-02 15:00:00 -> -1.340\n               2017-02-02 16:00:00 -> -1.307\n               2017-02-02 17:00:00 -> -1.507\n               2017-02-02 18:00:00 -> -1.273\n               2017-02-02 19:00:00 -> -0.402\n               2017-02-02 20:00:00 -> -0.234\n               2017-02-02 21:00:00 -> -0.368\n               2017-02-02 22:00:00 -> -0.737\n               2017-02-02 23:00:00 -> -1.172\n\n        Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 44. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 45. Note: This is a simple method. In practice, we might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints, we use this.\n\n 46. We output the next 96 points.\n\n Let's code the output.\n",
