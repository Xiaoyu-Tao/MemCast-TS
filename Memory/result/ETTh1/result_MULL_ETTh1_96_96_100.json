        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and there are missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points. \n    However, we must be cautious for the next 96 points? Actually, the instruction says the data we are given has missing values, but the provided sample does not show any. \n    Since the problem states that we must be aware of missing values, we are to handle them if present. But in the given data, there are no missing values in the 96 points.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 3. We choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data is hourly and we have only 96 points (4 days), we can observe:\n    - There seems to be a daily pattern (24-hour cycle). For example, the values are higher during the day and lower at night? But looking at the data, the pattern is not very clear and there are negative values.\n\n 4. We can use a simple method like Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, or Prophet. However, with only 96 points and the need to forecast 96 points (which is a long horizon), we might use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 5. Since the data is short, we can try to fit a model with daily seasonality (seasonal period of 24).\n\n 6. We note that the data has some negative values, so we cannot use models that require positive data (like multiplicative seasonality without transformation). But additive seasonality should be fine.\n\n 7. We'll use an additive Holt-Winters method (Exponential Smoothing with trend and seasonality) with a seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use SARIMA. But with only 4 days, fitting a SARIMA model might be challenging because we have only 4 seasonal periods. \n\n 9. Given the constraints, we'll use Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with additive trend and additive seasonality. However, note that the data does not show a clear trend.\n\n10. Another approach: use a naive method? But we are asked for a forecast and we are experts.\n\n11. We'll use the `statsmodels` library for ETS or SARIMA. But since we are in a text-based environment, we cannot run code. Therefore, we must rely on a precomputed forecast or use a simple method.\n\n12. However, the problem requires the next 96 points. We must generate them.\n\n13. Since we cannot run code here, we have to think of an alternative. The problem says we are an expert, so we can use our knowledge to simulate a forecast.\n\n14. But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data\", meaning we have to output 96 lines of data.\n\n15. We can use a simple approach: \n    - Compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days we have, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (since 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours).\n\n    However, the data might have a trend? Let's check the last day (2017-08-08) has very negative values, which is different from the previous days. So the average might not be the best.\n\n16. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-08) as the pattern for the next days? But that day is an outlier? It is consistently negative.\n\n17. We must consider that the data might have anomalies. But without more context, we have to make an assumption.\n\n18. Since the problem states that the data has missing values, but we are not given any in the provided 96, we assume that the next 96 might have missing? But we are to provide the complete data. So we are to fill in the forecast without missing.\n\n19. Approach: \n    We will use the average of each hour across the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. But note the last day is very different. \n\n    Let's break the data by day:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-08-05): \n          00: 2.097, 01: 1.599, ... , 23: -0.640\n        Day 2 (2017-08-06): \n          00: 0.178, 01: 0.320, ... , 23: 0.497\n        Day 3 (2017-08-07): \n          00: 0.604, 01:0.959, ... ,23: -1.350\n        Day 4 (2017-08-08): \n          00: 1.457, 01:1.492, ... ,23: -2.025\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (2.097 + 0.178 + 0.604 + 1.457) / 4 = 4.336 / 4 = 1.084\n        hour1: (1.599 + 0.320 + 0.959 + 1.492) / 4 = 4.37 / 4 = 1.0925\n\n    But wait, the last day (2017-08-08) has negative values in the later hours? So we average all 4 days for each hour.\n\n    However, the pattern on 2017-08-08 is very different (negative in the afternoon and evening). This might be an anomaly? \n\n    Since we are to forecast the next 4 days, and we don't know if the anomaly will continue, we have two options:\n        a) Assume the anomaly is a new pattern and use the last day as the pattern for the next days? \n        b) Or treat it as an outlier and use the average of the first three days?\n\n    But without more context, we go with the average of all 4 days.\n\n20. We'll compute the average for each of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days and then use that average for the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps for computation:\n        For hour h in [0,23]:\n            value_h = (day1_h + day2_h + day3_h + day4_h) / 4\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (2017-08-09 to 2017-08-12), we assign:\n        Day 5 (2017-08-09): hour0 = value_0, hour1 = value_1, ... hour23 = value_23\n        Day 6 (2017-08-10): same as above\n        Day 7 (2017-08-11): same\n        Day 8 (2017-08-12): same\n\n21. But note: the data we are given ends at 2017-08-08 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be:\n\n        2017-08-09 00:00:00\n        2017-08-09 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-08-12 23:00:00\n\n22. We must generate 96 data points.\n\n23. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n    Hour 0: [2.097, 0.178, 0.604, 1.457] -> (2.097+0.178+0.604+1.457)/4 = 4.336/4 = 1.084\n    Hour 1: [1.599, 0.320, 0.959, 1.492] -> (1.599+0.320+0.959+1.492)=4.37 -> 1.0925\n    Hour 2: [0.497, 0.178, 0.426, 1.279] -> (0.497+0.178+0.426+1.279)=2.38 -> 0.595\n    Hour 3: [1.279, 0.391, 0.426, 0.426] -> (1.279+0.391+0.426+0.426)=2.522 -> 0.6305\n    Hour 4: [0.426, 0.000, 0.533, 0.924] -> (0.426+0+0.533+0.924)=1.883 -> 0.47075\n    Hour 5: [0.817, -0.249, 0.178, 0.853] -> (0.817-0.249+0.178+0.853)=1.599 -> 0.39975\n    Hour 6: [0.817, -0.569, -0.178, 0.107] -> (0.817-0.569-0.178+0.107)=0.177 -> 0.04425\n    Hour 7: [0.178, -0.284, 0.604, 0.355] -> (0.178-0.284+0.604+0.355)=0.853 -> 0.21325\n    Hour 8: [0.675, 0.320, 1.208, -0.497] -> (0.675+0.320+1.208-0.497)=1.706 -> 0.4265\n    Hour 9: [0.746, 1.173, 0.817, -2.949] -> (0.746+1.173+0.817-2.949)= -0.213 -> -0.05325\n    Hour 10: [1.386, 1.919, 2.168, -1.457] -> (1.386+1.919+2.168-1.457)=4.016 -> 1.004\n    Hour 11: [3.020, 2.594, 2.487, -1.990] -> (3.020+2.594+2.487-1.990)=6.111 -> 1.52775\n    Hour 12: [2.416, 2.487, 2.345, -0.711] -> (2.416+2.487+2.345-0.711)=6.537 -> 1.63425\n    Hour 13: [3.482, 2.736, 2.701, -2.132] -> (3.482+2.736+2.701-2.132)=6.787 -> 1.69675\n    Hour 14: [2.274, 2.274, 3.020, -1.421] -> (2.274+2.274+3.020-1.421)=6.147 -> 1.53675\n    Hour 15: [0.249, 1.173, 0.036, -1.990] -> (0.249+1.173+0.036-1.990)= -0.532 -> -0.133\n    Hour 16: [1.031, 0.711, -0.640, -2.132] -> (1.031+0.711-0.640-2.132)= -1.03 -> -0.2575\n    Hour 17: [-0.249, -0.213, -0.853, -2.487] -> (-0.249-0.213-0.853-2.487)= -3.802 -> -0.9505\n    Hour 18: [0.107, -0.853, -0.711, -1.812] -> (0.107-0.853-0.711-1.812)= -3.269 -> -0.81725\n    Hour 19: [-0.746, -1.279, -1.137, -2.097] -> (-0.746-1.279-1.137-2.097)= -5.259 -> -1.31475\n    Hour 20: [-0.462, -0.178, -0.284, -1.990] -> (-0.462-0.178-0.284-1.990)= -2.914 -> -0.7285\n    Hour 21: [-1.137, -0.320, -1.599, -2.594] -> (-1.137-0.320-1.599-2.594)= -5.65 -> -1.4125\n    Hour 22: [-0.675, 0.497, 0.213, -2.061] -> (-0.675+0.497+0.213-2.061)= -2.026 -> -0.5065\n    Hour 23: [-0.640, 0.497, -1.350, -2.025] -> (-0.640+0.497-1.350-2.025)= -3.518 -> -0.8795\n\n24. Now, we create the next 4 days (96 hours) by repeating these 24 average values for 4 times.\n\n    The dates:\n        Start: 2017-08-09 00:00:00 (which is the next after 2017-08-08 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-08-09 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n\n25. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n26. However, note: the average might smooth out the pattern and the last day was an outlier. But this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n27. We output the data in the same format: two columns: date and MULL.\n\n28.

We note that the values are computed with 4 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places to match the input? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n    But the input had up to 3 decimal places. Let's round to 3 decimal places.\n\n30. Rounding:\n\n        1.084 -> 1.084 (same as 1.084)\n        1.0925 -> 1.093 (rounding half up: 2.5 becomes 3, so 1.0925 is 1.093? But note: 1.0925 is exactly halfway? Actually, 1.0925 is 1.5 in the fourth decimal? \n\n    We'll round to 3 decimal places: round(x, 3)\n\n    However, let's do it:\n\n        Hour0: 1.084 -> 1.084\n        Hour1: 1.0925 -> 1.093 (because 1.0925 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5, so round up the 3rd decimal: 2 becomes 3 -> 1.093)\n\n    But note: the input had values like -0.249, which is 3 decimals. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n31. We recalculate each value to 3 decimal places by rounding.\n\n    We'll recompute the averages and round:\n\n        Hour0: (2.084) -> but we computed 1.084? Actually, we computed 1.084, which is 1.336? Let me recalc:\n\n        Hour0: 2.097+0.178+0.604+1.457 = 2.097+0.178=2.275; 2.275+0.604=2.879; 2.879+1.457=4.336 -> 4.336/4=1.084 -> 1.084 (3 decimal: 1.084)\n\n        Hour1: 1.599+0.320+0.959+1.492 = 1.599+0.320=1.919; 1.919+0.959=2.878; 2.878+1.492=4.37 -> 4.37/4=1.0925 -> rounded to 3 decimals: 1.093\n\n    We'll do this for all.\n\n    Alternatively, we can output with 3 decimals by rounding.\n\n32. We'll generate the 96 points by repeating the 24 rounded averages for 4 days.\n\n33. Let's compute the rounded averages for each hour:\n\n    Hour0: 1.084 -> 1.084\n    Hour1: 1.0925 -> 1.093\n    Hour2: 0.595 -> 0.595\n    Hour3: 0.6305 -> 0.631 (since 0.6305 -> 0.631)\n    Hour4: 0.47075 -> 0.471\n    Hour5: 0.39975 -> 0.400\n    Hour6: 0.04425 -> 0.044\n    Hour7: 0.21325 -> 0.213\n    Hour8: 0.4265 -> 0.427\n    Hour9: -0.05325 -> -0.053\n    Hour10: 1.004 -> 1.004\n    Hour11: 1.52775 -> 1.528\n    Hour12: 1.63425 -> 1.634\n    Hour13: 1.69675 -> 1.697\n    Hour14: 1.53675 -> 1.537\n    Hour15: -0.133 -> -0.133\n    Hour16: -0.2575 -> -0.258\n    Hour17: -0.9505 -> -0.951\n    Hour18: -0.81725 -> -0.817\n    Hour19: -1.31475 -> -1.315\n    Hour20: -0.7285 -> -0.729\n    Hour21: -1.4125 -> -1.413\n    Hour22: -0.5065 -> -0.507\n    Hour23: -0.8795 -> -0.880\n\n34. Now, we write the next 4 days:\n\n    Day1: 2017-08-09\n    Day2: 2017-08-10\n    Day3: 2017-08-11\n    Day4: 2017-08-12\n\n    Each day has 24 hours.\n\n35. We output the data in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple average method. In practice, we might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints (no code execution, small data) we use this.\n\nLet's write the data.\n",
