        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the High Useful Load (HUFL) from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily pattern (24-hour periodicity) and also some intra-day variations.\n 2. Given the small amount of data (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast the next 4 days, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n 3. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, but the provided sample does not. So we assume the provided 96 points are complete for the purpose of building the model.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 steps ahead and we have hourly data with daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: higher values during the day (especially in the evening) and lower during the night and early morning.\n   - There is a drop in the middle of the day (around 9-15) to negative values.\n\n Given the complexity and the limited data, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by taking the same hour from the last available day (or average of last few days) but we only have 4 days.\n   - Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or a simple ARIMA with seasonal component.\n\n But note: we are to forecast 96 points and we have exactly 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). We don't have a long history.\n\n Considering the data, we can try to use a model that uses the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But note the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n The last day (2017-02-13) seems to have slightly lower values than the first day? But not a strong trend.\n\n However, we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). We can use:\n\n   y_{t+1} to y_{t+96} where t is the last time point.\n\n We can use a seasonal naive method: for each hour in the next 96 hours, we take the value from the same hour of the previous day (or the same hour from the same day of the week? but we only have 4 days and they are consecutive: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday). \n\n But note: the pattern on 2017-02-10 (Friday) and 2017-02-13 (Monday) might be similar because they are weekdays? However, 2017-02-11 and 2017-02-12 are weekends.\n\n How to handle? We have:\n   Day 1: Friday (2017-02-10)\n   Day 2: Saturday (2017-02-11)\n   Day 3: Sunday (2017-02-12)\n   Day 4: Monday (2017-02-13)\n\n We are to forecast:\n   Day 5: Tuesday (2017-02-14)\n   Day 6: Wednesday (2017-02-15)\n   Day 7: Thursday (2017-02-16)\n   Day 8: Friday (2017-02-17)\n\n Since we have only one Monday (2017-02-13) and one Friday (2017-02-10), we cannot average multiple Mondays or Fridays.\n\n Approach 1: Use the last day (Monday) for the next day (Tuesday) and then use the same pattern? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n Approach 2: Since we have only 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 4 days? But that would smooth out the daily pattern and we might lose the weekday/weekend effect.\n\n Approach 3: Use a model that captures the daily seasonality and the trend. We can use Holt-Winters with additive seasonality and a daily seasonality of 24.\n\n However, with only 4 days, the model might not be very stable.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   - Use a seasonal naive method for the next 24 hours (first day of forecast) by taking the same hour from the last day (Monday, 2017-02-13).\n   - Then for the next 24 hours (second day), we take the same hour from the day before the last day (Sunday, 2017-02-12) because we don't have a Tuesday in history? But that might not be consistent.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available days? But note the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) might be different patterns.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we don't have a Tuesday in the history, the best we can do is to use the Monday pattern? or the average of the weekdays we have? We have one Friday and one Monday. We can average the Friday and Monday for the same hour to represent a weekday? Then for the next day (Tuesday) we use that average. For Wednesday, we don't have a Wednesday, so we use the same as Tuesday? But that would be the same as the average of Friday and Monday again? Then for Thursday same, and then for Friday we use the Friday pattern? But we only have one Friday.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the day of the week effect, and we have very limited data.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide the forecast, I will use:\n\n   For the first 24 hours (2017-02-14, Tuesday): use the values from the last day (2017-02-13, Monday) because Monday is the closest weekday to Tuesday.\n\n   For the next 24 hours (2017-02-15, Wednesday): use the values from 2017-02-13 (Monday) again? or from 2017-02-10 (Friday)? Since we don't have a Wednesday, we can use the average of the two weekdays (Friday and Monday) for each hour.\n\n   Similarly, for Thursday (2017-02-16): use the average of Friday and Monday.\n\n   For Friday (2017-02-17): use the values from 2017-02-10 (Friday) because it's the same day of the week.\n\n But note: the data for Friday (2017-02-10) and Monday (2017-02-13) are different. We can compute the average for each hour.\n\n However, let's check the data for the same hour on Friday and Monday:\n\n   Example at 00:00: \n        Friday: 9.846\n        Monday: 13.530   -> average = (9.846 + 13.530)/2 = 11.688\n\n   But the Saturday and Sunday are also available? They are weekends. We are forecasting weekdays? So we should not use weekends for weekdays.\n\n Therefore, for the weekdays in the forecast (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) we use:\n\n   Tuesday: Monday's pattern (2017-02-13)\n   Wednesday: average of Friday (2017-02-10) and Monday (2017-02-13) for each hour\n   Thursday: average of Friday and Monday\n   Friday: Friday's pattern (2017-02-10)\n\n But note: the next Friday (2017-02-17) is a week after 2017-02-10? There might be a trend? We don't have enough data to capture a weekly trend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the Monday (2017-02-13) for Tuesday, then the average of Friday and Monday for Wednesday and Thursday, and then for Friday we use the Friday (2017-02-10) but adjusted by the difference between Monday and the previous Friday? \n\n The difference between Friday (2017-02-10) and Monday (2017-02-13) is 3 days. We can compute a daily drift? But that might be too sensitive.\n\n Given the complexity and the limited data, I will stick to:\n\n   Day 1 (Tuesday): 2017-02-13 (Monday) values\n   Day 2 (Wednesday): average of 2017-02-10 (Friday) and 2017-02-13 (Monday) for each hour\n   Day 3 (Thursday): same as Day 2 (the average)\n   Day 4 (Friday): 2017-02-10 (Friday) values\n\n But note: the average of Friday and Monday might be a good representation for a typical weekday? and then Friday we use the actual Friday pattern.\n\n However, we are not accounting for any trend. The Monday data is higher than Friday in the early hours? But in the middle of the day, the negative values are similar.\n\n Let me compare the two weekdays:\n\n   Friday (2017-02-10) and Monday (2017-02-13) at each hour:\n\n   We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 00: (9.846 + 13.530) / 2 = 11.688\n   Hour 01: (8.506 + 12.324) / 2 = 10.415\n   Hour 02: (7.703 + 9.176) / 2 = 8.4395\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for Monday at 00:00 is 13.530 and Friday at 00:00 is 9.846. The average is 11.688. Is that reasonable? We don't have evidence of a trend, so we are assuming stationarity.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the Monday pattern for the next day and then the Friday pattern for the last day, and for the middle two days we use the average? \n\n However, the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. We are to forecast the next 96. We are not given any missing values in the provided data.\n\n Considering the above, I will generate the forecast as:\n\n   First 24 hours (2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-14 23:00:00): same as 2017-02-13 (Monday) values.\n\n   Next 24 hours (2017-02-15 00:00:00 to 2017-02-15 23:00:00): average of 2017-02-10 (Friday) and 2017-02-13 (Monday) for each hour.\n\n   Next 24 hours (2017-02-16 00:00:00 to 2017-02-16 23:00:00): same as the above (again the average of Friday and Monday).\n\n   Last 24 hours (2017-02-17 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00): same as 2017-02-10 (Friday) values.\n\n But note: the date of the forecast:\n\n   The last given date is 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n\n   The next 96 hours:\n\n      2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-14 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      2017-02-15 00:00:00 to 2017-02-15 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      2017-02-16 00:00:00 to 2017-02-16 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      2017-02-17 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the Monday (2017-02-13) data: from index 72 to 95 (0-indexed: 72,73,...,95) -> 24 values.\n\n   Step 2: Extract the Friday (2017-02-10) data: from index 0 to 23.\n\n   Step 3: Compute the average for each hour: (Friday[i] + Monday[i]) / 2 for i in 0..23.\n\n   Step 4: Then the forecast:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-14): Monday pattern (24 values)\n        Day2 (2017-02-15): average pattern (24 values)\n        Day3 (2017-02-16): average pattern (same as day2)\n        Day4 (2017-02-17): Friday pattern (24 values)\n\n But note: the Friday pattern is from 2017-02-10, which is a week before? But we are forecasting 2017-02-17, which is the next Friday.\n\n However, we don't have a better pattern for Friday.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n But wait: the data for Monday (2017-02-13) and Friday (2017-02-10) are:\n\n   Monday: \n        00:00: 13.530\n        01:00: 12.324\n        02:00: 9.176\n        03:00: 8.908\n        04:00: 8.975\n        05:00: 8.640\n        06:00: 8.506\n        07:00: 11.989\n        08:00: 8.707\n        09:00: 2.813\n        10:00: -2.210\n        11:00: -3.416\n        12:00: -7.234\n        13:00: -6.698\n        14:00: -5.559\n        15:00: -3.483\n        16:00: 1.273\n        17:00: 7.703\n        18:00: 8.105\n        19:00: 9.913\n        20:00: 9.645\n        21:00: 9.578\n        22:00: 10.449\n        23:00: 9.645\n\n   Friday:\n        00:00: 9.846\n        01:00: 8.506\n        02:00: 7.703\n        03:00: 7.435\n        04:00: 7.301\n        05:00: 7.234\n        06:00: 7.636\n        07:00: 9.243\n        08:00: 8.239\n        09:00: 1.407\n        10:00: -2.478\n        11:00: -5.090\n        12:00: -8.105\n        13:00: -7.502\n        14:00: -6.229\n        15:00: -3.885\n        16:00: 3.215\n        17:00: 9.645\n        18:00: 10.851\n        19:00: 13.664\n        20:00: 13.999\n        21:00: 12.994\n        22:00: 11.721\n        23:00: 11.186\n\n   Average for each hour:\n\n        h0: (9.846 + 13.530) / 2 = 11.688\n        h1: (8.506 + 12.324) / 2 = 10.415\n        h2: (7.703 + 9.176) / 2 = 8.4395\n        h3: (7.435 + 8.908) / 2 = 8.1715\n        h4: (7.301 + 8.975) / 2 = 8.138\n        h5: (7.234 + 8.640) / 2 = 7.937\n        h6: (7.636 + 8.506) / 2 = 8.071\n        h7: (9.243 + 11.989) / 2 = 10.616\n        h8: (8.239 + 8.707) / 2 = 8.473\n        h9: (1.407 + 2.813) / 2 = 2.11\n        h10: (-2.478 + -2.210) / 2 = -2.344\n        h11: (-5.090 + -3.416) / 2 = -4.253\n        h12: (-8.105 + -7.234) / 2 = -7.6695\n        h13: (-7.502 + -6.698) / 2 = -7.1\n        h14: (-6.229 + -5.559) / 2 = -5.894\n        h15: (-3.885 + -3.483) / 2 = -3.684\n        h16: (3.215 + 1.273) / 2 = 2.244\n        h17: (9.645 + 7.703) / 2 = 8.674\n        h18: (10.851 + 8.105) / 2 = 9.478\n        h19: (13.664 + 9.913) / 2 = 11.7885\n        h20: (13.999 + 9.645) / 2 = 11.822\n        h21: (12.994 + 9.578) / 2 = 11.286\n        h22: (11.721 + 10.449) / 2 = 11.085\n        h23: (11.186 + 9.645) / 2 = 10.4155\n\n Now, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n   First 24 (2017-02-14): \n        00:00: 13.530\n        01:00: 12.324\n        02:00: 9.176\n        ... until 23:00: 9.645\n\n   Next 24 (2017-02-15):\n        00:00: 11.688\n        01:00: 10.415\n        02:00: 8.4395\n        ...
