        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-08-22 00:00:00 to 2016-08-25 23:00:00) for oil temperature (OT).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., from 2016-08-26 00:00:00 to 2016-08-29 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any missing values in the given segment.\n    However, the problem states that the dataset may have missing values. Since we are only given 96 points without missing values in this segment, we assume that for forecasting we can use this as a complete series.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to forecast 96 steps ahead, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Seasonality: There might be daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly, but we only have 4 days so weekly is not apparent.\n    - Trend: We can observe a daily pattern: temperatures rise during the day and fall at night.\n\n 3. We can use models like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can handle seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short series for training a model with daily seasonality (which has a period of 24).\n\n 5. Given the constraints, we can try to fit a model. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided segment we don't have any.\n\n 6. We are to forecast 96 steps. We must output the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted OT.\n\n 7. We'll use an automated approach to model the time series. Since we are in a simulated environment, we can use a simple model.\n\n 8. We'll use the following approach`:\n    - We'll use the series has a daily seasonality (period=24).\n    - We'll use a SARIMA model. We can also consider using a simple seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, but SARIMA is more straightforward.\n\n 9. However, note that with only 4 days, the model might not be very accurate. But we are required to provide the forecast.\n\n10. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the average of the same hour from the past 4 days? But we only have 4 days, so we can take the average of each hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall trend? But the trend over 4 days is not clear.\n\n11. Given the complexity and the fact that we are in a simulated environment, we will use a simple model: \n    - We'll use the last 4 days to compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days (which are 96 hours, 4*24=96).\n\n    Steps for the naive seasonal method:\n        - We have 4 days: day1 (2016-08-22), day2, day3, day4.\n        - For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average of that hour across the 4 days.\n        - Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2016-08-26 to 2016-08-29) will be the same pattern: for each hour, use the computed average.\n\n    But note: the data shows a slight trend? Let's check the first day and the last day:\n\n        Day1 (08-22): \n            min: 23.496 (at 08:00) and max: 29.968 (at 06:00) -> but note the max is actually at 06:00? \n            Actually, the pattern: \n                00:00: 27.506, then drops to 27.434 at 01:00, then rises to 29.968 at 06:00, then drops to 23.496 at 08:00? \n            This doesn't look like a typical daily pattern. \n\n        Actually, looking at the data, it seems there is a drop at 08:00 each day? \n\n        We must be cautious: the pattern might be:\n\n            Day1: \n                00:00: 27.506, 01:00:27.435, 02:00:28.983, 03:00:27.787, 04:00:29.897, 05:00:29.546, 06:00:29.968, 07:00:29.053, 08:00:23.496 -> big drop at 8am.\n\n        This drop at 8am is consistent? Let's check:\n\n            Day2 (08-23): \n                08:00: 28.068 -> no drop? It's actually rising from 07:00 (26.591) to 08:00 (28.068) and then to 09:00 (28.279).\n\n            Day3 (08-24):\n                08:00: 27.717 (from 07:00:26.943) -> So the pattern is not consistent. \n\n 12. Therefore, we might need a more robust method. We can try to use a model that automatically captures seasonality and trend.\n\n 13. We'll use the `statsmodels` library to fit a SARIMA model. But note: we are in a simulated environment and cannot run code? \n\n 14. Since we are to provide the forecast without running actual code, we must simulate the output.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a simple average method and hope that the pattern repeats.\n\n 16. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for hour 0 (00:00): \n        day1: 27.506, day2: 27.154, day3: 28.913, day4: 28.068 -> average = (27.506+27.154+28.913+28.068)/4 = 27.91025\n\n     Similarly, for hour 1 (01:00):\n        day1: 27.435, day2: 27.013, day3: 28.279, day4: 27.365 -> average = (27.435+27.013+28.279+27.365)/4 = 27.523\n\n     And so on.\n\n 17. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 18. However, we note that the data might have a trend? The overall level of the temperature might be changing? \n\n     Let's look at the average of each day:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day2: average = ... \n\n     We don't have a clear trend in the overall level? \n\n        Day1: \n            min: 23.496, max: 29.968 -> average? \n            We can compute: \n                total = 27.506+27.435+28.983+27.787+29.897+29.546+29.968+29.053+23.496+25.395+28.35+29.124+29.827+29.475+28.702+29.124+28.842+28.772+28.139+27.013+26.662+26.732+27.154+26.802\n                = 27.506+27.435+28.983+27.787+29.897+29.546+29.968+29.053+23.496+25.395+28.35+29.124+29.827+29.475+28.702+29.124+28.842+28.772+28.139+27.013+26.662+26.732+27.154+26.802\n                Let me calculate step by step:\n\n                Group: \n                27.506+27.435 = 54.941\n                +28.983 = 83.924\n                +27.787 = 111.711\n                +29.897 = 141.608\n                +29.546 = 171.154\n                +29.968 = 201.122\n                +29.053 = 230.175\n                +23.496 = 253.671\n                +25.395 = 279.066\n                +28.35 = 307.416\n                +29.124 = 336.54\n                +29.827 = 366.367\n                +29.475 = 395.842\n                +28.702 = 424.544\n                +29.124 = 453.668\n                +28.842 = 482.51\n                +28.772 = 511.282\n                +28.139 = 539.421\n                +27.013 = 566.434\n                +26.662 = 593.096\n                +26.732 = 619.828\n                +27.154 = 646.982\n                +26.802 = 673.784\n\n                average day1 = 673.784 / 24 = 28.074333\n\n        Day2: \n            We have 24 points: \n            27.154, 27.013, 27.013, 26.732, 26.662, 26.802, 26.31, 26.591, 28.068, 28.279, 28.35, 29.546, 29.616, 30.531, 31.867, 32.149, 33.133, 32.852, 31.515, 30.882, 29.686, 29.757, 29.475, 29.475\n\n            Sum: \n            27.154+27.013+27.013+26.732+26.662+26.802+26.31+26.591+28.068+28.279+28.35+29.546+29.616+30.531+31.867+32.149+33.133+32.852+31.515+30.882+29.686+29.757+29.475+29.475\n\n            = 27.154+27.013=54.167\n            +27.013=81.18\n            +26.732=107.912\n            +26.662=134.574\n            +26.802=161.376\n            +26.31=187.686\n            +26.591=214.277\n            +28.068=242.345\n            +28.279=270.624\n            +28.35=298.974\n            +29.546=328.52\n            +29.616=358.136\n            +30.531=388.667\n            +31.867=420.534\n            +32.149=452.683\n            +33.133=485.816\n            +32.852=518.668\n            +31.515=550.183\n            +30.882=581.065\n            +29.686=610.751\n            +29.757=640.508\n            +29.475=670.0 (approx) -> but let me add the last two: 29.475+29.475=58.95 -> 640.508+58.95=699.458\n\n            Actually: \n                640.508 + 29.475 = 669.983\n                +29.475 = 699.458\n\n            average day2 = 699.458 / 24 = 29.144083\n\n        Day3: \n            data: \n            28.913,28.279,28.209,27.506,27.295,26.872,26.591,26.943,27.717,28.139,29.546,29.616,29.897,30.671,32.571,32.993,34.189,33.837,31.797,31.234,30.179,29.475,29.194,28.42\n\n            Sum:\n            28.913+28.279=57.192\n            +28.209=85.401\n            +27.506=112.907\n            +27.295=140.202\n            +26.872=167.074\n            +26.591=193.665\n            +26.943=220.608\n            +27.717=248.325\n            +28.139=276.464\n            +29.546=306.01\n            +29.616=335.626\n            +29.897=365.523\n            +30.671=396.194\n            +32.571=428.765\n            +32.993=461.758\n            +34.189=495.947\n            +33.837=529.784\n            +31.797=561.581\n            +31.234=592.815\n            +30.179=622.994\n            +29.475=652.469\n            +29.194=681.663\n            +28.42=710.083\n\n            average day3 = 710.083 / 24 = 29.586792\n\n        Day4: \n            data: \n            28.068,27.365,27.154,26.802,26.31,26.591,26.239,27.928,28.631,29.616,32.149,31.656,31.586,33.063,33.204,32.852,33.907,33.696,32.149,31.867,30.32,30.179,29.827,28.772\n\n            Sum:\n            28.068+27.365=55.433\n            +27.154=82.587\n            +26.802=109.389\n            +26.31=135.699\n            +26.591=162.29\n            +26.239=188.529\n            +27.928=216.457\n            +28.631=245.088\n            +29.616=274.704\n            +32.149=306.853\n            +31.656=338.509\n            +31.586=370.095\n            +33.063=403.158\n            +33.204=436.362\n            +32.852=469.214\n            +33.907=503.121\n            +33.696=536.817\n            +32.149=568.966\n            +31.867=600.833\n            +30.32=631.153\n            +30.179=661.332\n            +29.827=691.159\n            +28.772=719.931\n\n            average day4 = 719.931 / 24 = 29.997125\n\n        The daily averages: \n            day1: 28.07, day2: 29.14, day3: 29.59, day4: 30.00 -> increasing trend.\n\n    19.

We can compute the linear trend of the daily averages and then project the next 4 days.\n\n        Daily averages: \n            day1: 28.07, day2: 29.14, day3: 29.59, day4: 30.00\n\n        Let day index: 1,2,3,4\n\n        We can fit a linear regression: y = a + b*x, where x is the day index.\n\n        We'll compute the slope (b) and intercept (a) for the daily averages.\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) we can compute the daily level.\n\n        Then for each hour in a day, we take the base pattern (the average for that hour) and then adjust by the difference between the projected daily level and the overall average of the past 4 days.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Step 1: Compute the overall average of the 4 daily averages: \n              overall_avg = (28.07+29.14+29.59+30.00)/4 = 116.8/4 = 29.2\n\n          Step 2: Fit a linear trend to the daily averages:\n\n              x = [1,2,3,4], y = [28.07, 29.14, 29.59, 30.00]\n\n              n = 4\n              sum_x = 1+2+3+4 = 10\n              sum_y = 28.8 (but actually 28.07+29.14+29.59+30.00 = 116.8)\n              sum_xy = 1*28.07 + 2*29.14 + 3*29.59 + 4*30.00 = 28.07 + 58.28 + 88.77 + 120.00 = 295.12\n              sum_x2 = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n              b = (n*sum_xy - sum_x*sum_y) / (n*sum_x2 - (sum_x)^2)\n                = (4*295.12 - 10*116.8) / (4*30 - 100)\n                = (1180.48 - 1168) / (120 - 100)\n                = 12.48 / 20 = 0.624\n\n              a = (sum_y - b*sum_x) / n = (116.8 - 0.624*10) / 4 = (116.8 - 6.24) / 4 = 110.56 / 4 = 27.64\n\n          Step 3: Project the next 4 days:\n\n              day5: x=5 -> y5 = 27.64 + 0.624*5 = 27.64 + 3.12 = 30.76\n              day6: x=6 -> y6 = 27.64 + 0.624*6 = 27.64 + 3.744 = 31.384\n              day7: x=7 -> y7 = 27.64 + 0.624*7 = 27.64 + 4.368 = 31.998\n              day8: x=8 -> y8 = 27.64 + 0.624*8 = 27.64 + 4.992 = 32.632\n\n          Step 4: For each hour h (0..23), compute the base value: base_h = average of that hour over the 4 days.\n\n          Step 5: For the forecast for day5 (first forecast day) at hour h:\n                  forecast_h = base_h + (y5 - overall_avg)\n\n          Similarly, for day6: forecast_h = base_h + (y6 - overall_avg)\n\n          But note: we are adding the same offset for all hours in a day? \n\n          Alternatively, we can scale: \n            forecast_h = base_h * (y5 / overall_avg)\n\n          However, additive adjustment is simpler and we don't know if the pattern scales.\n\n          We'll use additive adjustment:\n\n            offset5 = y5 - overall_avg = 30.76 - 29.2 = 1.56\n            offset6 = 31.384 - 29.2 = 2.184\n            offset7 = 31.998 - 29.2 = 2.798\n            offset8 = 32.632 - 29.2 = 3.432\n\n          Then for day5, hour0: base_0 + offset5\n          ... and so on.\n\n    21. We must compute the base_h for each hour.\n\n        Hour0 (00:00): \n            days: [27.506, 27.154, 28.913, 28.068] -> average = (27.506+27.154+28.913+28.068)/4 = 111.641/4 = 27.91025\n\n        Hour1 (01:00):\n            [27.435, 27.013, 28.279, 27.365] -> (27.435+27.013+28.279+27.365)=110.092 -> 27.523\n\n        Hour2 (02:00):\n            [28.983, 27.013, 28.209, 27.154] -> 28.983+27.013=56.0, +28.209=84.2, +27.154=111.359 -> 27.83975\n\n        Hour3 (03:00):\n            [27.787, 26.732, 27.506, 26.802] -> 27.787+26.732=54.519, +27.506=82.025, +26.802=108.827 -> 27.20675\n\n        Hour4 (04:00):\n            [29.897, 26.662, 27.295, 26.31] -> 29.897+26.662=56.559, +27.295=83.854, +26.31=110.164 -> 27.541\n\n        Hour5 (05:00):\n            [29.546, 26.802, 26.872, 26.591] -> 29.546+26.802=56.348, +26.872=83.22, +26.591=109.811 -> 27.45275\n\n        Hour6 (06:00):\n            [29.968, 26.31, 26.591, 26.239] -> 29.968+26.31=56.278, +26.591=82.869, +26.239=109.108 -> 27.277\n\n        Hour7 (07:00):\n            [29.053, 26.591, 26.943, 27.928] -> 29.053+26.591=55.644, +26.943=82.587, +27.928=110.515 -> 27.62875\n\n        Hour8 (08:00):\n            [23.496, 28.068, 27.717, 28.631] -> 23.496+28.068=51.564, +27.717=79.281, +28.631=107.912 -> 26.978\n\n        Hour9 (09:00):\n            [25.395, 28.279, 28.139, 29.616] -> 25.395+28.279=53.674, +28.139=81.813, +29.616=111.429 -> 27.85725\n\n        Hour10 (10:00):\n            [28.35, 28.35, 29.546, 32.149] -> 28.35+28.35=56.7, +29.546=86.246, +32.149=118.395 -> 29.59875\n\n        Hour11 (11:00):\n            [29.124, 29.546, 29.616, 31.656] -> 29.124+29.546=58.67, +29.616=88.286, +31.656=119.942 -> 29.9855\n\n        Hour12 (12:00):\n            [29.827, 29.616, 29.897, 31.586] -> 29.827+29.616=59.443, +29.897=89.34, +31.586=120.926 -> 30.2315\n\n        Hour13 (13:00):\n            [29.475, 30.531, 30.671, 33.063] -> 29.475+30.531=60.006, +30.671=90.677, +33.063=123.74 -> 30.935\n\n        Hour14 (14:00):\n            [28.702, 31.867, 32.571, 33.204] -> 28.702+31.867=60.569, +32.571=93.14, +33.204=126.344 -> 31.586\n\n        Hour15 (15:00):\n            [29.124, 32.149, 32.993, 32.852] -> 29.124+32.149=61.273, +32.993=94.266, +32.852=127.118 -> 31.7795\n\n        Hour16 (16:00):\n            [28.842, 33.133, 34.189, 33.907] -> 28.842+33.133=61.975, +34.189=96.164, +33.907=130.071 -> 32.51775\n\n        Hour17 (17:00):\n            [28.772, 32.852, 33.837, 33.696] -> 28.772+32.852=61.624, +33.837=95.461, +33.696=129.157 -> 32.28925\n\n        Hour18 (18:00):\n            [28.139, 31.515, 31.797, 32.149] -> 28.139+31.515=59.654, +31.797=91.451, +32.149=123.6 -> 30.9\n\n        Hour19 (19:00):\n            [27.013, 30.882, 31.234, 31.867] -> 27.013+30.882=57.895, +31.234=89.129, +31.867=120.996 -> 30.249\n\n        Hour20 (20:00):\n            [26.662, 29.686, 30.179, 30.32] -> 26.662+29.686=56.348, +30.179=86.527, +30.32=116.847 -> 29.21175\n\n        Hour21 (21:00):\n            [26.732, 29.757, 29.475, 30.179] -> 26.732+29.757=56.489, +29.475=85.964, +30.179=116.143 -> 29.03575\n\n        Hour22 (22:00):\n            [27.154, 29.475, 29.194, 29.827] -> 27.154+29.475=56.629, +29.194=85.823, +29.827=115.65 -> 28.9125\n\n        Hour23 (23:00):\n            [26.802, 29.475, 28.42, 28.772] -> 26.802+29.475=56.277, +28.42=84.697, +28.772=113.469 -> 28.36725\n\n    22.

We'll write the entire 96 records.\n\n 30. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values? We are not given any in the input, and we are to forecast without gaps.\n\n 31. We'll generate the next 96 timestamps and the forecasted OT.\n\n 32. We must output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-08-26 00:00:00 29.470\n2016-08-26 01:00:00 29.083\n... \n```\n\n 33. We'll do the computation for all 96.\n\n 34. However, note: the method is a bit simplistic. But given the constraints, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 35. Let's code the entire 96 in the answer.\n\n 36. We'll generate:\n\n      Start date: 2016-08-26 00:00:00\n      Then 2016-08-26 01:00:00 ... until 2016-08-26 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n      Then 2016-08-27 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      Then 2016-08-28 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00 -> next 24\n      Then 2016-08-29 00:00:00 ... 23:00:00 -> last 24\n\n 37. We have the base for each hour (0-23) and the offsets for the 4 days (1.56, 2.184, 2.798, 3.432).\n\n 38. We'll create a list of base values for hour0 to hour23 (in order).\n\n 39. Then for day5 (index0 in the forecast days) we add offset0 (1.56) to each base value for the 24 hours.\n\n 40. Similarly for the next days.\n\n 41. We'll write the data.\n\n 42. Note: We are rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n 43. Base values (0-23) as computed above:\n\n        base = [\n            27.91025, 27.523, 27.83975, 27.20675, 27.541, 27.45275, 27.277, 27.62875, \n            26.978, 27.85725, 29.59875, 29.9855, 30.2315, 30.935, 31.586, 31.7795, \n            32.51775, 32.28925, 30.9, 30.249, 29.21175, 29.03575, 28.9125, 28.36725\n        ]\n\n 44. Offsets = [1.56, 2.184, 2.798, 3.432]\n\n 45. Now, we generate:\n\n        for day_index in range(4):   # 4 days\n            for hour in range(24):\n                value = base[hour] + offsets[day_index]\n                # round to 3 decimals\n                value = round(value, 3)\n\n 46. And the date:\n\n        start_date = datetime(2016,8,26,0,0,0)\n        then for the first day: \n            date = start_date + timedelta(days=0, hours=hour)\n        second day: start_date + timedelta(days=1, hours=hour)\n\n 47. But note: the input data has the date as \"2016-08-22 00:00:00\", so we output in the same format.\n\n 48. We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 49. We'll write the data.\n\n 50.
