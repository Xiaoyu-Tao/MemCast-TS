        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-06-10 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 4. The data might have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. However, we must be cautious in our method to handle missing values if they were present, but the provided data is complete.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points, we can observe that the data has daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a seasonal time series model.\n\n Given the constraints and the fact that we are to provide a complete forecast for 96 points, we can use a model such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last available season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24, and repeat for 4 days.\n   - However, the data might have a trend? Let's look at the last 24 hours (2017-06-13 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) and compare with previous days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are none. Since we are forecasting, we must produce 96-point forecast without any gaps.\n\n We can use a simple method: \n   - Use the last 24 hours (from 2017-06-13 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) and repeat it 4 times (for the next 4 days).\n\n However, let's check if there is a trend or level shift? The data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days, but there is a daily pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the last 4 days for each hour? But the problem says we must provide the forecast for the next 96 points.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to be efficient, we can use:\n\n   Method 1: Seasonal Naive (using the last day as the forecast for the next day, repeated for 4 days)\n\n   But note: the last day (2017-06-13) might be a Tuesday? We don't have the day of week, but the data starts on 2017-06-10 (Saturday) and ends on 2017-06-13 (Tuesday). \n   We are forecasting for 2017-06-14 (Wednesday) to 2017-06-17 (Saturday). \n\n   However, without more data, it's hard to capture weekly seasonality. We only have 4 days of data.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the last 24 hours (the day of 2017-06-13) and repeat it for the next 4 days.\n\n   Steps:\n     - The last 24 points (from 2017-06-13 00:00:00 to 2017-06-13 23:00:00) are:\n          00:00: 2.102\n          01:00: 2.284\n          02:00: 2.224\n          03:00: 2.406\n          04:00: 2.224\n          05:00: 2.955\n          06:00: 3.320\n          07:00: 3.107\n          08:00: 3.046\n          09:00: 3.137\n          10:00: 3.290\n          11:00: 3.746\n          12:00: 2.467\n          13:00: 2.680\n          14:00: 2.619\n          15:00: 2.589\n          16:00: 2.345\n          17:00: 2.772\n          18:00: 2.711\n          19:00: 2.589\n          20:00: 3.137\n          21:00: 2.680\n          22:00: 2.224\n          23:00: 1.980\n\n     - We will use these 24 values and repeat them for the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n   The dates for the forecast will start from 2017-06-14 00:00:00 and go up to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n   How to generate the dates?\n        Start: 2017-06-14 00:00:00 (next after 2017-06-13 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-06-14 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-06-17 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96 hours.\n\n   So the forecast for:\n        2017-06-14 00:00:00 -> 2.102 (same as 2017-06-13 00:00:00)\n        2017-06-14 01:00:00 -> 2.284 (same as 2017-06-13 01:00:00)\n        ...\n        2017-06-14 23:00:00 -> 1.980 (same as 2017-06-13 23:00:00)\n        2017-06-15 00:00:00 -> 2.102 (again, same as 2017-06-13 00:00:00)\n        ... and so on.\n\n   However, note that the pattern might change slightly from day to day. But with only 4 days of history, we don't have a strong weekly pattern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 available days? But that might smooth out the pattern.\n\n   Since the problem does not specific the method, and we are to provide a complete forecast, we choose the seasonal naive as it is simple and commonly used for seasonal data.\n\n   But note: the data has 4 days, and we are forecasting 4 days. We can also consider using the average of the same hour for the past 4 days? \n\n   Let's compare:\n\n     Option 1: Use the last day (2017-06-13) only -> simple and captures the most recent day.\n\n     Option 2: Average of the same hour for the 4 days (2017-06-10, 2017-06-11, 2017-06-12, 2017-06-13).\n\n   We'll do Option 2 to see if it smooths the pattern and might be more robust.\n\n   Example for hour 00:00:\n        Day1 (2017-06-10): 2.254\n        Day2 (2017-06-11): 1.980\n        Day3 (2017-06-12): 1.919\n        Day4 (2017-06-13): 2.102\n        Average = (2.254 + 1.980 + 1.919 + 2.102) / 4 = 8.255/4 = 2.06375\n\n   Similarly for other hours.\n\n   However, note that the data might have a trend? The level of the time series on 2017-06-13 is a bit different from previous days? \n\n   We are not sure. Since we are only given 4 days, and the problem does not specify the method, we can choose either.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. In our provided data there are none, but if we were to average, we would need to handle missing values. However, we are not given any missing values in the history.\n\n   We'll go with the average method for each hour over the 4 days to get a more stable pattern.\n\n   Steps for average method:\n\n        For hour h (where h from 0 to 23):\n            value_h = (value_{day1, h} + value_{day2, h} + value_{day3, h} + value_{day4, h}) / 4\n\n        Then we use this 24-hour profile and repeat it for the next 4 days.\n\n   However, note: the data starts at 2017-06-10 00:00:00 (which is day1) and ends at 2017-06-13 23:00:00 (day4). We have exactly 4 days.\n\n   We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Let's create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): [2.254, 1.980, 1.919, 2.102] -> 2.06375\n        Hour 1 (01:00): [2.071, 1.797, 1.828, 2.284] -> (2.071+1.797+1.828+2.284)/4 = 7.98/4 = 1.995\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-06-14): [avg_h0, avg_h1, ..., avg_h23]\n        Day2 (2017-06-15): [avg_h0, avg_h1, ..., avg_h23]\n        Day3 (2017-06-16): [avg_h0, avg_h1, ..., avg_h23]\n        Day4 (2017-06-17): [avg_h0, avg_h1, ..., avg_h23]\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        h0: (2.254 + 1.980 + 1.919 + 2.102) / 4 = (2.254+1.980=4.234;

We are not given any missing values in the history and we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n  We choose the average method because it smooths out the daily pattern and is less sensitive to the last day's noise.\n\n  But note: the problem does not specify the method, so we are using a reasonable approach.\n\n  Let's code the output in the required answer format.\n\n  Important: The answer must be in the exact format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n        [date and value lines]\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n  We'll write 96 lines.\n\n  Steps for generating the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-06-14 00:00:00\n        Then add 1 hour for each step until 96 steps.\n\n  We'll create a list of dates:\n\n        import datetime  [But note: we are not allowed to use code? We are to write the output as text.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Day1: 2017-06-14 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n          Day2: 2017-06-15 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n          Day3: 2017-06-16 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n          Day4: 2017-06-17 00:00:00 to 23:00:00\n\n  We have the pattern for 24 hours: [2.064, 1.995, 1.919, 2.010, 1.988, 2.650, 2.939, 3.008, 2.848, 3.084, 3.244, 3.503, 2.505, 2.680, 2.703, 2.650, 2.665, 3.000, 2.886, 2.658, 2.962, 2.703, 2.346, 2.170]\n\n  Then we repeat this list 4 times.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n        2017-06-14 00:00:00 2.064\n        2017-06-14 01:00:00 1.995\n        ... \n        2017-06-14 23:00:00 2.170\n        2017-06-15 00:00:00 2.064\n        ...\n        2017-06-17 23:00:00 2.170\n\n  We'll write the data in the same format: the date string and then the LUFL value with 3 decimal places.\n\n  Let's do it.\n",
