        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-03-10 00:00:00 to 2017-03-13 23:00:00) for the High UseLess Load (HULL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has hourly frequency and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n 2. The data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told that the dataset may have missing values. \n    However, for the provided 96 points, we have a complete set. So we can proceed with the given data.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n 4. Since the data shows a clear daily seasonality (with patterns repeating every 24 hours) and also some level of non-stationarity, \n    we can use a time series model that captures seasonality and trends.\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need for forecasting 96 points ahead, we can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters).\n\n 6. However, note that the data has negative values and fluctuations. We must choose a model that can handle such data.\n\n 7. We'll use an automated approach to select the best model parameters, but due to the constraints of this environment, we can use a simple model.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a machine learning model, but with only 96 points, it might be challenging.\n\n 9. We can use the seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, but again, with only 4 days, the seasonality might not be very stable.\n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete set of 96 forecasts, we can use a simple method: \n     - We can compute the average of each hour across the 4 days and then adjust with a trend if necessary.\n\n 11. However, looking at the data, there is a trend? Let's check the first and last day:\n\n     2017-03-10: \n        00:00: 2.076, 01:00: 2.210, ... 23:00: 0.938\n     2017-03-11: \n        00:00: 0.804, ... 23:00: -0.335\n     2017-03-12: \n        00:00: 1.942, ... 23:00: 1.005\n     2017-03-13: \n        00:00: 2.143, ... 23:00: 0.402\n\n     The pattern is not very consistent. Therefore, we might need a more robust method.\n\n 12. We can use the ExponentialSmoothing model from statsmodels, which can handle seasonality and trend.\n\n 13. Steps for ExponentialSmoothing:\n     - We have hourly data with a seasonality of 24 hours.\n     - We can try additive or multiplicative seasonality. Since the variation seems to be relatively constant, we choose additive.\n\n 14. But note: the data has negative values, so multiplicative seasonality is not appropriate (because multiplicative requires positive data). Therefore, we use additive.\n\n 15. We'll fit an Exponential Smoothing model with:\n     trend: 'add' or None? Let the model decide? We can try with trend and without.\n     seasonal: 'add'\n     seasonal_periods: 24\n\n 16. However, with only 4 seasons (4 days), the model might not be very stable.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use a simple model: the average of each hour of the day over the 4 days, and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n     For example, for hour 00:00: \n        (2.076 + 0.804 + 1.942 + 2.143) / 4 = 1.74125\n\n     Then for hour 01:00: \n        (2.210 + 1.541 + 2.009 + 3.014) / 4 = 2.1935\n\n     And so on.\n\n 18. But this method ignores any trend. We can also compute a moving average to smooth out the data.\n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96 points, we can use the average method for each hour.\n\n 20. However, we note that the data has a downward trend? Let's see the overall average per day:\n\n        Day 1 (03-10): average = (sum of 24 values) / 24\n        Day 2: average = (sum of next 24) / 24\n        Day 3: average = (sum of next 24) / 24\n        Day 4: average = (sum of last 24) / 24\n\n     We can compute:\n\n        Day1: \n          2.076, 2.210, 1.875, 1.741, 1.674, 3.215, 1.942, 2.411, 2.478, 1.541, 0.871, 0.268, -0.335, -0.268, 0.469, 0.067, -0.134, -0.268, -1.005, -1.072, -1.273, -1.808, 0.134, 0.938\n          Sum = 14.197, Avg = 0.5915416667\n\n        Day2:\n          0.804, 1.541, 2.009, 1.273, 1.005, 0.469, 1.407, 1.608, 1.273, 1.206, 0.804, 1.407, 0.737, 1.474, 1.340, 1.139, 0.000, -0.201, -1.072, -1.139, -1.072, -0.469, 0.335, -0.335\n          Sum = 12.163, Avg = 0.5067916667\n\n        Day3:\n          1.942, 2.009, -0.067, 0.469, 0.670, 0.134, 1.072, 1.541, 2.478, 1.273, 0.938, 0.670, -0.402, 0.000, 0.201, -0.067, -0.268, -0.469, -1.139, -1.273, -1.273, -2.076, -0.201, 1.005\n          Sum = 5.198, Avg = 0.2165833333\n\n        Day4:\n          2.143, 3.014, 2.277, 1.741, 1.875, 2.344, 1.139, 0.938, 1.273, -0.201, 0.737, 0.469, -0.402, -0.402, 0.000, -0.335, -0.871, -1.005, -1.407, -0.938, -0.938, -1.942, -0.603, 0.402\n          Sum = 5.488, Avg = 0.2286666667\n\n     The daily averages are: 0.5915, 0.5068, 0.2166, 0.2287 -> there is a drop from day1 to day3 and then a slight increase on day4.\n\n 21. We can adjust the hourly average by a trend. We can compute a linear trend from the daily averages and project for the next 4 days.\n\n     Let t=1 for day1, t=2 for day2, t=3 for day3, t=4 for day4, and then for the next 4 days: t=5,6,7,8.\n\n     We fit a linear regression: average = a + b*t\n\n        t: [1,2,3,4]\n        y: [0.5915, 0.5068, 0.2166, 0.2287]\n\n     Then we get the trend for the next 4 days.\n\n 22. However, the trend is not very clear and the data is only 4 days. We might overfit.\n\n 23. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we can use the average of the 4 days for each hour and then adjust by the overall trend of the daily averages.\n\n     Let the overall trend be the average of the last day (day4) minus the average of the first day (day1) divided by 3 (the number of intervals) -> (0.2287 - 0.5915)/3 = -0.120933333 per day.\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, we have:\n\n        Day5: day4_avg + (-0.1209) = 0.2287 - 0.1209 = 0.1078\n        Day6: 0.1078 - 0.1209 = -0.0131\n        Day7: -0.0131 - 0.1209 = -0.134\n        Day8: -0.134 - 0.1209 = -0.2549\n\n     Then for each hour in the next 4, we take the base hourly average (over the 4 days) and then adjust by the daily trend:\n\n        For hour i in [0,23]:\n            base_i = (value_day1_i + value_day2_i + value_day3_i + value_day4_i) / 4\n            Then for day5 (the first forecast day): \n                forecast_i = base_i + (0.1078 - overall_avg_of_base)\n            But wait, we need to adjust the base_i by the daily level.\n\n     Alternatively, we can compute the deviation of each day's hourly value from the day's average, then the base_i is the average of these deviations. Then we add the projected daily average for the future day.\n\n        Let:\n            base_i = ( (day1_i - day1_avg) + (day2_i - day2_avg) + (day3_i - day3_avg) + (day4_i - day4_avg) ) / 4\n\n        Then for day5, hour i: \n            forecast_i = base_i + day5_avg\n\n        Similarly for day6, hour i: forecast_i = base_i + day6_avg\n\n 24. This method is called \"seasonal adjustment with trend projection\".\n\n 25. Let's compute:\n\n        Step 1: Compute the daily averages (we have them: day1_avg, day2_avg, day3_avg, day4_avg).\n        Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the deviation from the daily average for each of the 4 days.\n        Step 3: Average these deviations for each hour -> base_i (which is the average deviation for that hour).\n        Step 4: Project the daily averages for the next 4 days (day5, day6, day7, day8) using the linear trend we estimated.\n\n        We have the daily averages: [0.5915, 0.5068, 0.2166, 0.2287]\n        We fit a linear regression: \n            Let t = [1,2,3,4]\n            y = [0.5915, 0.5068, 0.2166, 0.2287]\n\n        We can use numpy if we had, but we are not. We can compute:\n\n            slope (b) = (n*sum(t*y) - sum(t)*sum(y)) / (n*sum(t^2) - (sum(t))^2)\n            intercept (a) = (sum(y) - b*sum(t)) / n\n\n        n=4\n        sum(t) = 1+2+3+4 = 10\n        sum(y) = 0.5915+0.5068+0.2166+0.2287 = 1.5436\n        sum(t*y) = 1*0.5915 + 2*0.5068 + 3*0.2166 + 4*0.2287 \n                 = 0.5915 + 1.0136 + 0.6498 + 0.9148 = 3.1697\n        sum(t^2) = 1+4+9+16 = 30\n\n        b = (4*3.1697 - 10*1.5436) / (4*30 - 10^2) \n           = (12.6788 - 15.436) / (120 - 100)\n           = (-2.7572) / 20 = -0.13786\n\n        a = (1.5436 - (-0.13786)*10) / 4\n           = (1.5436 + 1.3786) / 4\n           = 2.9222 / 4 = 0.73055\n\n        Then the model: y_hat = 0.73055 - 0.13786 * t\n\n        For t=5: y5 = 0.73055 - 0.13786*5 = 0.73055 - 0.6893 = 0.04125\n        t=6: y6 = 0.73055 - 0.13786*6 = 0.73055 - 0.82716 = -0.09661\n        t=7: y7 = 0.73055 - 0.13786*7 = 0.73055 - 0.96502 = -0.23447\n        t=8: y8 = 0.73055 - 0.13786*8 = 0.73055 - 1.10288 = -0.37233\n\n 26. Now, we compute the base_i for each hour (0 to 23). We'll create an array of 24 values.\n\n        base_i = ( (day1_i - day1_avg) + (day2_i - day2_avg) + (day3_i - day3_avg) + (day4_i - day4_avg) ) / 4\n\n 27. Then for the next 4 days (day5 to day8), for each hour i:\n\n        day5, hour i: forecast = base_i + y5\n        day6, hour i: forecast = base_i + y6\n        day7, hour i: forecast = base_i + y7\n        day8, hour i: forecast = base_i + y8\n\n 28. We generate the dates: \n        day5: 2017-03-14 00:00:00 to 2017-03-14 23:00:00\n        day6: 2017-03-15 00:00:00 to 2017-03-15 23:00:00\n        day7: 2017-03-16 00:00:00 to 2017-03-16 23:00:00\n        day8: 2017-03-17 00:00:00 to 2017-03-17 23:00:00\n\n 29. We must be cautious: the provided data ends at 2017-03-13 23:00:00, so the next day is 2017-03-14.\n\n 30. Let's compute the base_i for each hour.\n\n     We have the data for 4 days (each day has 24 hours). We'll index by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n\n     Hour0 (00:00:00):\n        day1: 2.076, day1_avg=0.5915 -> deviation = 2.076 - 0.5915 = 1.4845\n        day2: 0.804, day2_avg=0.5068 -> deviation = 0.804 - 0.5068 = 0.2972\n        day3: 1.942, day3_avg=0.2166 -> deviation = 1.942 - 0.2166 = 1.7254\n        day4: 2.143, day4_avg=0.2287 -> deviation = 2.143 - 0.2287 = 1.9143\n        base0 = (1.4845+0.2972+1.7254+1.9143)/4 = 5.4214/4 = 1.35535\n\n     Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 31. Then we compute the forecast for day5 (t=5) for hour0: 1.35535 + 0.04125 = 1.3966\n\n 32. We do this for every hour and for the next 4 days.\n\n 33. However, note: the method might produce negative values and that is acceptable because the original data has negatives.\n\n 34. We must compute 24 base_i values and then 4 daily levels (y5, y6, y7, y8) and then add.\n\n 35. We'll write a small program in our mind to compute the 24 base_i.\n\n     Let's do it step by step for each hour.\n\n     We have the data:\n\n        Day1: [2.076, 2.210, 1.875, 0.804, ...] -> 24 values\n        Day2: [0.804, 1.541, ...]\n        Day3: [1.942, 2.009, ...]\n        Day4: [2.143, 3.014, ...]\n\n     We have the daily averages: [0.5915, 0.5068, 0.2166, 0.2287]\n\n     We'll create a list for base_i for i=0 to 23.\n\n     base[0] = ( (2.076 - 0.5915) + (0.804 - 0.5068) + (1.942 - 0.2166) + (2.143 - 0.2287) ) / 4\n     ... and so on.\n\n 36. We'll compute the base_i for each hour and then the forecast for the next 4 days.\n\n 37. Due to the length, we'll write a table for the answer.\n\n 38. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. So we use the given.\n\n 39. We'll compute the base_i for each hour:\n\n        Hour0: base0 = ( (2.076-0.5915) + (0.804-0.5068) + (1.942-0.2166) + (2.143-0.2287) ) / 4 \n               = (1.4845 + 0.2972 + 1.7254 + 1.9143) / 4 = 5.4214 / 4 = 1.35535\n\n        Hour1: \n            day1: 2.210 -
