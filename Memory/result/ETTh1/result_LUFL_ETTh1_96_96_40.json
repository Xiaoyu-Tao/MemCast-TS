        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LUFL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also some weekly pattern (though we only have 4 days, so weekly might be harder to capture).\n 2. Given the short history (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days (96 hours) ahead, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n 3. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points? However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data seems complete. \n    Since the problem says \"be aware of that\", we should consider that in the forecasting process we might need to impute if there are missing values in the training data? \n    But in the provided 96 points, there are no missing values. So we can proceed without imputation for the training data.\n\n 4. We choose a model: \n    - Given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal model. Since we have hourly data and a seasonality of 24, we can use SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n    - However, with only 4 days (96 points) and forecasting 96 points (which is the same length as the history), a more straightforward method might be to use a seasonal naive method or a model that uses the daily pattern.\n\n 5. Considering the data: \n    - We observe that the load has a daily pattern: low during the night, then a peak in the morning (around 6-7 AM) and then fluctuations during the day, and then drops again at night.\n    - The values also show some variation from day to day.\n\n 6. Approach:\n    - We can use a seasonal naive forecast: using the last available season (i.e., the previous day) as the forecast for the next day. But note we have 4 days of history and we are forecasting 4 days.\n    - However, the pattern might change slightly. Alternatively, we can take the average of the same hour across the 4 available days and use that as the forecast for each hour in the next 4 days? \n      But that would be a constant daily pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 7. But note: the problem does not specify the time of year, but we are in December. The next 4 days would be from 2016-12-12 to 2016-12-15. \n    We don't have information about holidays or special events, so we assume a regular pattern.\n\n 8. Given the short history, we can try to use the average of the same hour for the 4 days we have, and then adjust for any trend? \n    However, we don't have a clear trend in 4 days.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average model with seasonality. But since we are forecasting 96 steps ahead, we need a model that can project into the future.\n\n 10. We decide to use the following:\n     - We compute the average of each hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) over the 4 available days.\n     - Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat this average pattern for each day.\n\n 11. Why this approach?\n     - It captures the daily seasonality and smooths out the day-to-day variations.\n     - It is simple and robust for short-term forecasting when we have multiple seasons (days) of data.\n\n 12. Steps for calculation:\n     - Group the data by hour (i.e., for hour 0: all the values at 00:00, hour 1: 01:00, etc.)\n     - Compute the mean for each hour.\n     - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00), we assign the mean value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 13. However, note that the last day in the data is 2016-12-11. The next 96 hours would be:\n        Day 1: 2016-12-12 (00:00 to 23:00)\n        Day 2: 2016-12-13\n        Day 3: 2016-12-14\n        Day 4: 2016-12-15\n\n 14. We must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 15. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n     We have 4 days, so for each hour (0 to 23) we have 4 values.\n\n     Example for hour 0 (00:00):\n        2016-12-08 00:00:00 -> 4.021\n        2016-12-09 00:00:00 -> 1.462\n        2016-12-10 00:00:00 -> 3.868\n        2016-12-11 00:00:00 -> 1.706\n        Average = (4.021 + 1.462 + 3.868 + 1.706) / 4 = 11.057 / 4 = 2.76425\n\n     Similarly for the other hours.\n\n 16. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 17. Then, for the next 4 days, we assign:\n        Day 1 (2016-12-12): \n            00:00:00 -> average of hour0\n            01:00:00 -> average of hour1\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> average of hour23\n\n        Day 2 (2016-12-13): same as above, same averages for each hour.\n\n        And so on.\n\n 18. This will give us 96 data points.\n\n 19. We must format the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 20. However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places, but the averages might have more. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 21. Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n     We note the data:\n\n        Hour 0 (00:00): [4.021, 1.462, 3.868, 1.706] -> mean = (4.021+1.462+3.868+1.706)/4 = 11.057/4 = 2.76425 -> 2.764\n        Hour 1 (01:00): [3.686, 1.462, 3.807, 1.432] -> (3.686+1.462+3.807+1.432)/4 = 10.387/4 = 2.59675 -> 2.597\n        Hour 2 (02:00): [3.686, 1.157, 3.838, 1.492] -> (3.686+1.157+3.838+1.492)/4 = 10.173/4 = 2.54325 -> 2.543\n        Hour 3 (03:00): [3.838, 1.279, 3.990, 1.492] -> (3.838+1.279+3.990+1.492)/4 = 10.599/4 = 2.64975 -> 2.650\n        Hour 4 (04:00): [3.807, 1.310, 4.051, 1.462] -> (3.807+1.310+4.051+1.462)/4 = 10.63/4 = 2.6575 -> 2.658\n        Hour 5 (05:00): [3.960, 4.142, 4.051, 1.767] -> (3.960+4.142+4.051+1.767)/4 = 13.92/4 = 3.480 -> 3.480\n        Hour 6 (06:00): [4.630, 4.477, 2.132, 2.315] -> (4.630+4.477+2.132+2.315)/4 = 13.554/4 = 3.3885 -> 3.389\n        Hour 7 (07:00): [5.239, 5.422, 2.711, 2.650] -> (5.239+5.422+2.711+2.650)/4 = 16.022/4 = 4.0055 -> 4.006\n        Hour 8 (08:00): [2.894, 2.833, 2.924, 2.711] -> (2.894+2.833+2.924+2.711)/4 = 11.362/4 = 2.8405 -> 2.841\n        Hour 9 (09:00): [1.645, 2.559, 2.437, 2.467] -> (1.645+2.559+2.437+2.467)/4 = 9.108/4 = 2.277 -> 2.277\n        Hour 10 (10:00): [2.619, 2.894, 2.711, 2.863] -> (2.619+2.894+2.711+2.863)/4 = 11.087/4 = 2.77175 -> 2.772\n        Hour 11 (11:00): [2.955, 3.259, 3.168, 3.137] -> (2.955+3.259+3.168+3.137)/4 = 12.519/4 = 3.12975 -> 3.130\n        Hour 12 (12:00): [2.498, 2.193, 2.345, 2.193] -> (2.498+2.193+2.345+2.193)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725 -> 2.307\n        Hour 13 (13:00): [2.559, 2.224, 2.589, 2.193] -> (2.559+2.224+2.589+2.193)/4 = 9.565/4 = 2.39125 -> 2.391\n        Hour 14 (14:00): [2.619, 2.315, 2.345, 2.041] -> (2.619+2.315+2.345+2.041)/4 = 9.32/4 = 2.330 -> 2.330\n        Hour 15 (15:00): [2.619, 2.224, 2.315, 2.284] -> (2.619+2.224+2.315+2.284)/4 = 9.442/4 = 2.3605 -> 2.361\n        Hour 16 (16:00): [2.041, 2.437, 2.589, 2.650] -> (2.041+2.437+2.589+2.650)/4 = 9.717/4 = 2.42925 -> 2.429\n        Hour 17 (17:00): [2.711, 2.955, 3.320, 3.076] -> (2.711+2.955+3.320+3.076)/4 = 12.062/4 = 3.0155 -> 3.016\n        Hour 18 (18:00): [3.076, 2.894, 2.924, 3.198] -> (3.076+2.894+2.924+3.198)/4 = 12.092/4 = 3.023 -> 3.023\n        Hour 19 (19:00): [2.680, 2.467, 2.711, 2.924] -> (2.680+2.467+2.711+2.924)/4 = 10.782/4 = 2.6955 -> 2.696\n        Hour 20 (20:00): [2.437, 2.224, 2.467, 2.467] -> (2.437+2.224+2.467+2.467)/4 = 9.595/4 = 2.39875 -> 2.399\n        Hour 21 (21:00): [2.224, 2.041, 2.102, 1.919] -> (2.224+2.041+2.102+1.919)/4 = 8.286/4 = 2.0715 -> 2.072\n        Hour 22 (22:00): [1.553, 1.584, 1.645, 1.858] -> (1.553+1.584+1.645+1.858)/4 = 6.64/4 = 1.660 -> 1.660\n        Hour 23 (23:00): [1.645, 1.553, 1.553, 1.919] -> (1.645+1.553+1.553+1.919)/4 = 6.67/4 = 1.6675 -> 1.668\n\n 22. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-12 00:00:00 (which is the next hour after 2016-12-11 23:00:00)\n\n        We'll generate:\n          2016-12-12 00:00:00 -> 2.764\n          2016-12-12 01:00:00 -> 2.597\n          ... until 2016-12-12 23:00:00 -> 1.668\n\n        Then 2016-12-13 00:00:00 -> 2.764 (same as hour0)\n        ... and so on until 2016-12-15 23:00:00.\n\n 23. We note that the dates must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 24. We write the dates in sequence:\n\n        from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00, hourly.\n\n 25. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 26. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided history there are none. \n     Our method of averaging over the same hour from the 4 days is robust to missing values? \n     Actually, if we had missing values in the history, we would have to impute them. But we don't have any.\n\n 27. We proceed to write the forecast.\n\n 28. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 29.
