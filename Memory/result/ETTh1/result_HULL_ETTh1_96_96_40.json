        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-12-08 00:00:00 to 2016-12-11 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we need to generate the timestamps and the forecasted HULL values.\n\n 4. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the data, we observe:\n    - The data has a daily pattern (24-hour periodicity) because we see peaks and troughs at similar hours.\n    - There might be some weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, so it's hard to capture weekly seasonality.\n\n 5. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we have hourly data and a clear daily pattern, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 6. Given the small data size (only 4 days) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by taking the same hour from the previous day (or the last available same hour).\n    - However, we have 4 days of data. We can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days? But note: the pattern might change.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) or an ARIMA model with seasonality. But with only 96 points, and 24-hour seasonality, \n    the seasonal ARIMA might be heavy. Also, we are missing data in general? But in this provided segment we don't.\n\n 8. Since the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided segment we don't, we can impute if needed. However, for forecasting we are only given 96 complete points.\n\n 9. We decide to use a simple method: the last observed day (2016-12-11) as the pattern for the next days? But note: the data on 2016-12-11 is very different (much lower) than the previous days.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available 4 days. But let's check the data:\n\n      We have:\n        Day 1: 2016-12-08 (Thursday)\n        Day 2: 2016-12-09 (Friday)\n        Day 3: 2016-12-10 (Saturday)\n        Day 4: 2016-12-11 (Sunday)\n\n      The next 96 hours would be from 2016-12-12 00:00:00 (Monday) to 2016-12-15 23:00:00 (Thursday).\n\n      Since the pattern on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) might be different from weekdays, we might not want to average all 4 days.\n\n 11. We can try to use the last week same day? But we don't have a full week of the same type. We have only one Sunday, one Saturday, etc.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the small data, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n 13. We choose: for each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 available days. Then we use that average for the corresponding hour in the forecast period.\n\n     However, note that the next 4 days (2016-12-12 to 2016-12-15) are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. We have:\n\n        Monday: we don't have a Monday in the past data? We have Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n     So we cannot use the same day of the week. Instead, we can use the overall average for each hour.\n\n 14. Steps for the same-hour average:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23):\n            value_h = (hull_h from day1 + hull_h from day2 + hull_h from day3 + hull_h from day4) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 96 hours (4 days) we assign:\n            Day 5 (2016-12-12): hour0 = value_0, hour1 = value_1, ... hour23 = value_23\n            Day 6 (2016-12-13): same values (because we don't have weekly data, so we repeat the same daily pattern)\n            Day 7 (2016-12-14): same\n            Day 8 (2016-12-15): same\n\n 15. But note: the data on Sunday (2016-12-11) is very low compared to the previous days. This might be because it's a Sunday. \n     However, the next days are weekdays (Monday to Thursday) which might be more similar to Thursday and Friday (2016-12-08 and 2016-12-09) than to the weekend.\n\n 16. Alternative: we can use only the weekdays (Thursday and Friday) for the next weekdays? But we have only two weekdays and two weekend days.\n\n     We can do:\n\n        For Monday to Thursday (weekdays) we use the average of Thursday and Friday (2016-12-08 and 2016-12-09) for the same hour.\n\n        But we are forecasting 4 days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. We don't have Tuesday and Wednesday in the past.\n\n     So we can use the average of Thursday and Friday for all the next weekdays? \n\n     However, note that the next Monday might be more similar to the previous Monday? But we don't have a Monday.\n\n 17. Given the data limitations, we decide to use:\n\n        For the next 4 days (which are all weekdays: Monday to Thursday) we use the average of the two weekdays we have (2016-12-08 and 2016-12-09) for each hour.\n\n        For the weekend days in the forecast? There are none in the next 4 days.\n\n 18. How about:\n\n        Let's break the 4 days we have:\n\n            Day1: 2016-12-08 (Thursday) -> weekday\n            Day2: 2016-12-09 (Friday)   -> weekday\n            Day3: 2016-12-10 (Saturday) -> weekend\n            Day4: 2016-12-11 (Sunday)   -> weekend\n\n        We are forecasting:\n\n            Day5: 2016-12-12 (Monday: weekday)\n            Day6: 2016-12-13 (Tuesday: weekday)\n            Day7: 2016-12-14 (Wednesday: weekday)\n            Day8: 2016-12-15 (Thursday: weekday)\n\n        So we can compute the average for each hour for the weekdays (only Thursday and Friday) and use that for the next 4 weekdays.\n\n        For each hour in 0..23:\n\n            avg_h = (hull of Thursday at hour h + hull of Friday at hour h) / 2\n\n        Then for each of the next 4 days, at hour h we set: avg_h\n\n 19. But note: the data for Thursday and Friday are:\n\n        Thursday (2016-12-08): \n            00:00: 1.206, 01:00: 1.072, ... 23:00: 3.885\n\n        Friday (2016-12-09):\n            00:00: 4.555, 01:00: 5.224, ... 23:00: 3.215\n\n        The average for hour0: (1.206 + 4.555)/2 = 2.8805\n\n        hour1: (1.072+5.224)/2 = 3.148\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 20. We'll compute the average for each hour and then generate 4 days (96 hours) of data by repeating the same daily pattern (the computed average for each hour) for 4 days.\n\n 21. However, note that the pattern on Thursday and Friday might be different? But we are averaging them to get a typical weekday pattern.\n\n 22. Let's code the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (1.206 + 4.555) / 2 = 2.8805\n        hour1: (1.072 + 5.224) / 2 = 3.148\n        hour2: (1.072 + 4.019) / 2 = 2.5455\n        hour3: (1.206 + 3.818) / 2 = 2.512\n        hour4: (1.206 + 3.818) / 2 = 2.512\n        hour5: (1.139 + 3.818) / 2 = 2.4785\n        hour6: (1.206 + 3.952) / 2 = 2.579\n        hour7: (1.474 + 3.550) / 2 = 2.512\n        hour8: (2.947 + 3.416) / 2 = 3.1815\n        hour9: (0.603 + 3.148) / 2 = 1.8755\n        hour10: (3.483 + 2.545) / 2 = 3.014\n        hour11: (2.545 + 3.215) / 2 = 2.88\n        hour12: (2.612 + 2.277) / 2 = 2.4445\n        hour13: (3.215 + 2.746) / 2 = 2.9805\n        hour14: (3.148 + 2.880) / 2 = 3.014\n        hour15: (3.483 + 3.215) / 2 = 3.349\n        hour16: (4.019 + 2.344) / 2 = 3.1815\n        hour17: (3.014 + 2.344) / 2 = 2.679\n        hour18: (3.014 + 3.550) / 2 = 3.282\n        hour19: (2.344 + 2.880) / 2 = 2.612\n        hour20: (2.344 + 2.411) / 2 = 2.3775\n        hour21: (1.139 + 2.143) / 2 = 1.641\n        hour22: (2.411 + 3.014) / 2 = 2.7125\n        hour23: (3.885 + 3.215) / 2 = 3.55\n\n 23. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) will be:\n\n        Day 5 (2016-12-12): \n            00:00:00 -> 2.8805\n            01:00:00 -> 3.148\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 3.55\n\n        Day 6 (2016-12-13): same as above\n        Day 7 (2016-12-14): same\n        Day 8 (2016-12-15): same\n\n 24. But note: the data on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is very different. We are not using them because the forecasted days are weekdays.\n\n 25. However, we must be cautious: the last day in the given data is Sunday, and the next day is Monday. We are using the average of Thursday and Friday for Monday? \n     But Monday might be more similar to Thursday and Friday than to the weekend.\n\n 26. We'll generate the timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2016-12-12 00:00:00 (the next after 2016-12-11 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-12-12 01:00:00 ... up to 2016-12-15 23:00:00.\n\n 27. We must output the data in the same format: two columns, with the date string and the HULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places? as in the input).\n\n 28. We round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. Let's compute the averages and round:\n\n        hour0: 2.8805 -> 2.881\n        hour1: 3.148 -> 3.148\n        ... we'll compute each.\n\n 30. Alternatively, we can output without rounding? The input has 3 decimal places. We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n 31. We write the 96 lines.\n\n 32. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, we are generating a complete forecast. We are not missing any.\n\n 33. We'll generate the data accordingly.\n\n 34. Let's double-check: the last given point is 2016-12-11 23:00:00 -> 1.674. Then the next is 2016-12-12 00:00:00 -> 2.881.\n\n 35. We'll create the list:\n\n        date: starting at 2016-12-12 00:00:00, then 2016-12-12 01:00:00, ... until 2016-12-15 23:00:00.\n\n        HULL: for each day, the 24 values (the 24 averages we computed) repeated 4 times.\n\n 36. We compute the 24 averages:\n\n        h0: (1.206 + 4.555) / 2 = 2.8805 -> 2.881\n        h1: (1.072 + 5.224) / 2 = 3.148 -> 3.148\n        h2: (1.072 + 4.019) / 2 = 2.5455 -> 2.546\n        h3: (1.206 + 3.818) / 2 = 2.512 -> 2.512\n        h4: (1.206 + 3.818) / 2 = 2.512 -> 2.512\n        h5: (1.139 + 3.818) / 2 = 2.4785 -> 2.479\n        h6: (1.206 + 3.952) / 2 = 2.579 -> 2.579\n        h7: (1.474 + 3.550) / 2 = 2.512 -> 2.512\n        h8: (2.947 + 3.416) / 2 = 3.1815 -> 3.182\n        h9: (0.603 + 3.148) / 2 = 1.8755 -> 1.876\n        h10: (3.483 + 2.545) / 2 = 3.014 -> 3.014\n        h11: (2.545 + 3.215) / 2 = 2.88 -> 2.880\n        h12: (2.612 + 2.277) / 2 = 2.4445 -> 2.445\n        h13: (3.215 + 2.746) / 2 = 2.9805 -> 2.981\n        h14: (3.148 + 2.880) / 2 = 3.014 -> 3.014\n        h15: (3.483 + 3.215) / 2 = 3.349 -> 3.349\n        h16: (4.019 + 2.344) / 2 = 3.1815 -> 3.182\n        h17: (3.014 + 2.344) / 2 = 2.679 -> 2.679\n        h18: (3.014 + 3.550) / 2 = 3.282 -> 3.282\n        h19: (2.344 + 2.880) / 2 = 2.612 -> 2.612\n        h20: (2.344 + 2.411) / 2 = 2.3775 -> 2.378\n        h21: (1.139 + 2.143) / 2 = 1.641 -> 1.641\n        h22: (2.411 + 3.014) / 2 = 2.7125 -> 2.713\n        h23: (3.885 + 3.215) / 2 = 3.55 -> 3.550\n\n 37. Now we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2016-12-12 00:00:00 -> 2.881\n               2016-12-12 01:00:00 -> 3.148\n               ... until 2016-12-12 23:00:00 -> 3.550\n\n        Day2: 2016-12-13 00:00:00 -> 2.881\n               2016-12-13 01:00:00 -> 3.148\n               ... same as day1\n\n        Day3: 2016-12-14: same\n        Day4: 2016-12-15: same\n\n 38. We output in the required format.\n\n 39. We note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 40.
