        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low Useful Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any missing value in the given excerpt.\n However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be prepared to handle them.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is at hourly frequency.\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL.\n\n Approach:\n Since the data is time series with potential seasonality (daily and weekly), we can use a model that captures multiple seasonality.\n However, we only have 4 days of data (96 hours) and we are to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history.\n\n Given the short history, we can consider:\n   - The data shows a daily pattern: low during the night, higher during the day, but note that the pattern is not exactly the same each day.\n\n But note: the data provided is from 2016-12-12 to 2016-12-15 (4 days). We are to forecast 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n However, the problem says the dataset is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are only given 4 days? Actually, the user says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", meaning 96 time points (each hour) for 4 days.\n\n Since we are only given 4 days, we cannot capture weekly seasonality. We can only rely on daily patterns.\n\n How to handle missing values? The given 96 points do not have missing values. But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\". \n We are not told which points are missing in the provided data? Actually, the provided data seems complete.\n\n However, to be safe, we should check for missing timestamps and impute if necessary. But the given data has 96 consecutive hours without gaps? Let's check:\n\n The first date: 2016-12-12 00:00:00 to 2016-12-15 23:00:00 -> exactly 4 days * 24 = 96 points.\n\n So we have a complete set for the history.\n\n For forecasting, we must produce 96 points without any missing.\n\n Model selection:\n   - We can use a simple method: take the average of the same hour for the past 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n     But note: the pattern might change, and we have only 4 days.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) or ARIMA. But with only 4 days, it's hard to fit a complex model.\n\n   - Another idea: use the last available day (day 4) as the pattern for the next day? But the problem says the data is from 2016-12-12 to 2016-12-15, which are consecutive days.\n\n   - However, looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly repeating. For example, the first day (2016-12-12) has a peak at 07:00 (5.117) and a drop at 08:00 (2.711). \n     The next days have similar drops but at different levels.\n\n   - We can try to use a moving average or a simple linear model? But with only 4 days, we don't have much.\n\n   - Since the problem says we are an expert, we can use a model that handles multiple seasonality, such as Prophet or TBATS. However, we are limited by the short history.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last day (2016-12-15) as the forecast for the next day? But then we have to forecast 4 days.\n\n   - Another idea: use the average of the four days for each hour. But note that the first day (2016-12-12) and the fourth day (2016-12-15) might be different.\n\n   - We can also consider a linear extrapolation for each hour of the day? But that might not be robust.\n\n Considering the constraints, I propose:\n\n   Step 1: Check for missing values in the provided data. Since we have 96 points and the timestamps are consecutive, we assume no missing in the history.\n\n   Step 2: We will use a simple average of the same hour across the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days. That is, for hour h (0 to 23), we compute the average of the 4 values at hour h, and then use that average for each of the next 4 days at hour h.\n\n   Why? Because we have only 4 days, and we are forecasting 4 days. We assume that the pattern is stable and the average of the best we can do.\n\n   However, note that the data might have a trend? But 4 days is too short to see a trend. Also, the problem does not specify any external variables.\n\n   But let's look at the data: \n        Day1: 2016-12-12\n        Day2: 2016-12-13\n        Day3: 2016-12-14\n        Day4: 2016-12-15\n\n   We can compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (4.142, 1.523, 4.234, 1.736) -> average = (4.142+1.523+4.234+1.736)/4 = 2.90875\n        hour1: (4.173, 1.553, 4.082, 1.553) -> average = (4.173+1.553+4.082+1.553)/4 = 2.84025\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for the next 4 days (2016-12-16 to 2016-12-19), each day we assign the average for the corresponding hour.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2016-12-15 ends at 23:00. The next day starts at 2016-12-16 00:00:00.\n\n   We have to generate 96 points: from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Day5 (2016-12-16): for hour0, use the average of hour0 from the 4 days; hour1, average of hour1, etc.\n        Day6 (2016-12-17): same as above, same averages for each hour.\n        Day7 (2016-12-18): same.\n        Day8 (2016-12-19): same.\n\n   This will give us 4 days * 24 hours = 96 points.\n\n   But note: the data might have a weekly pattern? We don't have weekly data. And the 4 days are consecutive, so we are capturing the daily pattern.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the provided 4 days might not be representative of the next 4 days? But without more history, this is the best we can do.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. But with only 4 days, it's hard.\n\n   Let's try to see if there is a trend? We can look at the overall level of each day:\n\n        Day1: average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n        Day2: ...\n        Day3: ...\n        Day4: ...\n\n   But we don't have enough to fit a trend.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the hourly average over the 4 days.\n\n   Step 3: Format the output.\n\n   We must generate 96 lines, starting from 2016-12-16 00:00:00 and ending at 2016-12-19 23:00:00.\n\n   The format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-16 00:00:00 <value1>\n2016-12-16 01:00:00 <value2>\n...\n2016-12-19 23:00:00 <value96>\n```\n\n   We compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days.\n\n   How to compute:\n\n        hour0: [2016-12-12 00:00:00, 2016-12-13 00:00:00, 2016-12-14 00:00:00, 2016-12-15 00:00:00] -> [4.142, 1.523, 4.234, 1.736] -> average = (4.142+1.523+4.234+1.736)/4 = 2.90875\n        hour1: [4.173, 1.553, 4.082, 1.553] -> (4.173+1.553+4.082+1.553)/4 = 2.84025\n        ... \n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast period, we assign the 24 averages in order.\n\n   We'll round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   The input has 3 decimal places, so we output 3 decimal places.\n\n   Let's compute all 24 hourly averages:\n\n        hour0: (4.142 + 1.523 + 4.234 + 1.736) / 4 = 11.635 / 4 = 2.90875 -> 2.909\n        hour1: (4.173 + 1.553 + 4.082 + 1.553) / 4 = 11.361 / 4 = 2.84025

+ 1.523 + 4.082 + 1.462) / 4 = 10.935 / 4 = 2.73375 -> 2.734\n        hour5: (4.142 + 1.736 + 4.051 + 1.645) / 4 = 11.574 / 4 = 2.8935 -> 2.894\n        hour6: (4.599 + 2.376 + 4.477 + 2.163) / 4 =

      hour9: (2.315 + 2.650 + 2.772 + 2.863) / 4 = 10.600 / 4 = 2.650 -> 2.650\n        hour10: (2.680 + 2.711 + 2.955 + 2.955) / 4 = 11.301 / 4 = 2.82525 -> 2.825\n        hour11: (2.833 + 2.619 +

2.292 -> 2.292\n        hour14: (1.888 + 2.102 + 2.315 + 2.680) / 4 = 8.985 / 4 = 2.24625 -> 2.246\n        hour15: (2.102 + 2.132 + 2.071 + 2.498) / 4 = 8.803 / 4 = 2.20075 -> 2.201\n        hour16: (2.498 + 2.498 + 2.528 + 2.711) / 4 = 10.235 / 4 = 2.55875 -> 2.559\n        hour17: (3.107 + 3.046 + 2.894 + 2.711) / 4 = 11.758 / 4 = 2.9395 -> 2.940\n        hour18: (2.924 + 2.924 + 3.015 + 3.198) / 4 = 12.061 / 4 = 3.01525 -> 3.015\n        hour19: (2.711 + 2.650 + 2.894 + 3.015) / 4 = 11.270 / 4 = 2.8175 -> 2.818\n        hour20: (2.376 + 2.284 + 2.589 + 2.863) / 4 = 10.112 / 4 = 2.528 -> 2.528\n        hour21: (1.888 + 1.949 + 2.315 + 2.376) / 4 = 8.528 / 4 = 2.132 -> 2.132\n        hour22: (1.797 + 1.645 + 1.980 + 1.828) / 4 = 7.250 / 4 = 1.8125 -> 1.813\n        hour23: (1.645 + 1.828 + 1.675 + 2.071) / 4 = 7.219 / 4 = 1.80475 -> 1.805\n\n   Now, we assign:\n\n        Day1 (2016-12-16):\n            00:00:00 -> 2.909\n            01:00:00 -> 2.840\n            02:00:00 -> 2.741\n            ... until 23:00:00 -> 1.805\n\n        Day2 (2016-12-17): same 24 values in the same as above.\n\n        Day3 (2016-12-18): same.\n\n        Day4 (2016-12-19): same.\n\n   So the first 24 hours: 2016-12-16 00:00:00 to 2016-12-16 23:00:00: use the 24 averages.\n   Then 24 hours for 2016-12-17: same 24 averages.\n   Then 2016-12-18: same.\n   Then 2016-12-19: same.\n\n   We generate the timestamps:\n\n        2016-12-16 00:00:00\n        2016-12-16 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2016-12-16 23:00:00\n        2016-12-17 00:00:00\n        ... \n        2016-12-19 23:00:00\n\n   We must be careful: the next day after 2016-12-15 is 2016-12-16.\n\n   Let's write the code in our mind:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2016, 16, 12) -> but we start at 2016-12-16.\n\n        We'll generate 96 timestamps: starting at 2016-12-16 00:00:00, then add 1 hour until 96 steps.\n\n   But we have the 24 averages in an array: `hourly_avg` of length 24.\n\n        hourly_avg = [2.909, 2.840, 2.741, 2.658, 2.734, 2.894, 3.404, 3.868, 2.795, 2.650, 2.825, 2.985, 2.247, 2.292, 2.246, 2.201, 2.559, 2.940, 3.015, 2.818, 2.528, 2.132, 1.813, 1.805]\n\n   Then for the k-th hour in the forecast period (0 to 95):\n\n        day_index = k // 24   (0,1,2,3)\n        hour_index = k % 24\n\n        value = hourly_avg[hour_index]\n\n   We output:\n\n        date = start_date + timedelta(hours=k)\n\n   Start date: 2016-12-16 00:00:00\n\n   We'll write the dates in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n   Example: 2016-12-16 00:00:00\n\n   We must output 96 lines.\n\n   Let's do it.\n\n   Note: We are rounding to 3 decimal places.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But in the history we didn't have any. And we are generating a complete forecast.\n\n   We are providing the complete 96 points.\n\n   Let's write the output.\n\n   Important: The answer must be in the exact format.\n\n   We note: the input data has the date string without any timezone? We assume UTC.\n\n   We output without timezone.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-12-16 00:00:00 2.909\n2016-12-16 01:00:00 2.840\n2016-12-16 02:00:00 2.741\n2016-12-16 03:00:00 2.658\n2016-12-16 04:00:00 2.734\n2016-12-16 05:00:00 2.894\n2016-12-16 06:00:00 3.404\n2016-12-16 07:00:00 3.868\n2016-12-16 08:00:00 2.795\n2016-12-16 09:00:00 2.650\n2016-12-16 10:00:00 2.825\n2016-12-16 11:00:00 2.985\n2016-12-16 12:00:00 2.247\n2016-12-16 13:00:00 2.292\n2016-12-16 14:00:00 2.246\n2016-12-16 15:00:00 2.201\n2016-12-16 16:00:00 2.559\n2016-12-16 17:00:00 2.940\n2016-12-16 18:00:00 3.015\n2016-12-16 19:00:00 2.818\n2016-12-16 20:00:00 2.528\n2016-12-16 21:00:00 2.132\n2016-12-16 22:00:00 1.813\n2016-12-16 23:00:00 1.805\n2016-12-17 00:00:00 2.909\n2016-12-17 01:00:00 2.840\n... and so on until 2016-12-19 23:00:00\n\n```\n\n   We have to repeat the same 24 values for 4 days.\n\n   Let's do it.\n\n   We'll write the 96 lines.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
