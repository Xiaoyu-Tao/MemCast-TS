        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"Middle UseLess Load\" (MULL) from 2017-04-07 00:00:00 to 2017-04-10 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) starting from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data may have missing values. However, in the provided 96 points, there are no missing entries (every hour is present). So we assume the given 96 points are complete.\n\n 2. We must choose a time series forecasting method. Since we are dealing with hourly data and there might be daily seasonality, we can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality), or even a simple moving average. However, with only 96 points (4 days) we have limited data for training.\n\n 3. Given the complexity and the requirement to forecast 96 points ahead, we might use a model that can capture seasonality. The data shows a clear daily pattern (with peaks and troughs at similar hours). We observe:\n    - The values are negative most of the time, with some positive values at the beginning of the day (around 00:00 to 05:00) and then becoming more negative during the day and evening.\n\n 4. We can use a seasonal decomposition to separate the trend, seasonality, and residual. However, with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal model: forecast each hour by the average of that hour in the past 4 days? But 4 days is very few for averaging.\n\n 5. Another approach: use the last available day (2017-04-10) as a template and adjust it by the average change from the previous days? But note that the data might have a trend.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we are not going to build a complex model. We can use a simple method: \n    - Calculate the average pattern for the 4 days we have for each hour (0 to 23). Then, we can use that average pattern for the next 4 days (96 hours). However, we see that the values are becoming more negative over the 4 days? Let's check:\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? But that would be a flat forecast for each hour across days. Alternatively, we can also account for a linear trend.\n\n 7. Let's try to estimate a trend from the 4 days. We can take the average of each day and see if there is a trend.\n\n    Day 1 (2017-04-07): average = (-0.640 -0.497 ... -0.071)/24 -> let's compute quickly (by eye: mostly negative, around -1.0) -> approximately -1.0\n    Day 2 (2017-04-08): similar, but note the positive values at 14:00 (1.137) and 13:00 (0.426) but then very negative at night -> approximately -1.0\n    Day 3 (2017-04-09): similar pattern, but the night values are around -2.5 -> average might be lower? \n    Day 4 (2017-04-10): even lower? \n\n    Actually, we can compute the daily average:\n\n    Day1: \n        sum = -0.640 -0.497 -0.711 +0.000 +0.355 -0.355 -1.244 -0.320 -0.853 -0.711 -0.426 -0.604 -1.208 -1.670 -0.426 -0.817 -1.350 -1.812 -2.203 -2.381 -2.416 -2.416 -1.635 -0.071\n        = -25.822\n        average = -25.822 / 24 = -1.0759\n\n    Day2:\n        sum = 0.213+0.107-1.102-0.213-0.782+0.355-0.497-0.178-0.604-0.675-1.386-0.391-0.853+0.426+1.137+0.249-0.426-1.564-2.487-2.594-2.523-2.239-2.665-0.782\n        = -16.077\n        average = -16.077 / 24 = -0.669875\n\n    Day3:\n        sum = 0.249-0.142-0.142+0.711-0.355-1.173-1.137+0.959-0.071-1.031-0.569-1.208-1.564-1.564-1.244-1.102-2.097-2.025-2.061-1.919-2.132-2.559-2.310-1.599\n        = -24.225\n        average = -24.225 / 24 = -1.009375\n\n    Day4:\n        sum = 0.142-0.249-0.213-1.279-0.107-0.249-0.355+0.213-1.031-1.848-1.066-1.670-1.919-1.741-1.954-2.132-2.559-2.665-2.630-2.487-2.452-3.589-2.487-0.782\n        = -31.122\n        average = -31.122 / 24 = -1.29675\n\n    The daily averages: \n        Day1: -1.0759\n        Day2: -0.6699\n        Day3: -1.0094\n        Day4: -1.2968\n\n    There is no clear linear trend? It goes down, up, then down. So we might ignore a trend and just use the seasonal pattern.\n\n 8. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days and then use that for the next 4 days.\n\n    For hour 00:00: [ -0.640 (day1), 0.213 (day2), 0.249 (day3), 0.142 (day4) ] -> average = (-0.640+0.213+0.249+0.142)/4 = (-0.640+0.604)/4 = -0.036/4 = -0.009\n    But wait: (-0.640+0.213 = -0.427; -0.427+0.249 = -0.178; -0.178+0.142 = -0.036) -> -0.036/4 = -0.009\n\n    Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n 9. However, note that the pattern might be changing. Since we have only 4 days, we might also consider using the last day (day4) as the base and adjust by the average deviation from the overall pattern? But that might be complex.\n\n10. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are not been given a lot of data, we will use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n    Steps:\n        For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, let:\n            avg_h = (value_h_day1 + value_h_day2 + value_h_day3 + value_h_day4) / 4\n\n        Then for the next 4 days (2017-04-11 to 2017-04-14), for each day, the hour h will be forecasted as avg_h.\n\n11. But note: the data starts at 2017-04-07 (which is day1) and ends at 2017-04-10 (day4). The next 96 hours are:\n        Day5: 2017-04-11\n        Day6: 2017-04-12\n        Day7: 2017-04-13\n        Day8: 2017-04-14\n\n    We will forecast for each hour in these days using the average of the same hour from the past 4 days.\n\n12. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a downward trend? But the daily averages did not show a consistent trend. Alternatively, we could use a weighted average (more weight to recent days) but with only 4 days, we can try a simple average.\n\n13. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n    Hour 0: [ -0.640, 0.213, 0.249, 0.142 ] -> (-0.640+0.213+0.249+0.142)/4 = (-0.036)/4 = -0.009\n    Hour 1: [ -0.497, 0.107, -0.142, -0.249 ] -> (-0.497+0.107-0.142-0.249)/4 = (-0.781)/4 = -0.19525\n    Hour 2: [ -0.711, -1.102, -0.142, -0.213 ] -> (-0.711-1.102-0.142-0.213)/4 = (-2.168)/4 = -0.542\n    Hour 3: [ 0.000, -0.213, 0.711, -1.279 ] -> (0.000-0.213+0.711-1.279)/4 = (-0.781)/4 = -0.19525\n    Hour 4: [ 0.355, -0.782, -0.355, -0.107 ] -> (0.355-0.782-0.355-0.107)/4 = (-0.889)/4 = -0.22225\n    Hour 5: [ -0.355, 0.355, -1.173, -0.249 ] -> (-0.355+0.355-1.173-0.249)/4 = (-1.422)/4 = -0.3555\n    Hour 6: [ -1.244, -0.497, -1.137, -0.355 ] -> (-1.244-0.497-1.137-0.355)/4 = (-3.233)/4 = -0.80825\n    Hour 7: [ -0.320, -0.178, 0.959, 0.213 ] -> (-0.320-0.178+0.959+0.213)/4 = (0.674)/4 = 0.1685\n    Hour 8: [ -0.853, -0.604, -0.071, -1.031 ] -> (-0.853-0.604-0.071-1.031)/4 = (-2.559)/4 = -0.63975\n    Hour 9: [ -0.711, -0.675, -1.031, -1.848 ] -> (-0.711-0.675-1.031-1.848)/4 = (-4.265)/4 = -1.06625\n    Hour 10: [ -0.426, -1.386, -0.569, -1.066 ] -> (-0.426-1.386-0.569-1.066)/4 = (-3.447)/4 = -0.86175\n    Hour 11: [ -0.604, -0.391, -1.208, -1.670 ] -> (-0.604-0.391-1.208-1.670)/4 = (-3.873)/4 = -0.96825\n    Hour 12: [ -1.208, -0.853, -1.564, -1.919 ] -> (-1.208-0.853-1.564-1.919)/4 = (-5.544)/4 = -1.386\n    Hour 13: [ -1.670, 0.426, -1.564, -1.741 ] -> (-1.670+0.426-1.564-1.741)/4 = (-4.549)/4 = -1.13725\n    Hour 14: [ -0.426, 1.137, -1.244, -1.954 ] -> (-0.426+1.137-1.244-1.954)/4 = (-2.487)/4 = -0.62175\n    Hour 15: [ -0.817, 0.249, -1.102, -2.132 ] -> (-0.817+0.249-1.102-2.132)/4 = (-3.802)/4 = -0.9505\n    Hour 16: [ -1.350, -0.426, -2.097, -2.559 ] -> (-1.350-0.426-2.097-2.559)/4 = (-6.432)/4 = -1.608\n    Hour 17: [ -1.812, -1.564, -2.025, -2.665 ] -> (-1.812-1.564-2.025-2.665)/4 = (-8.066)/4 = -2.0165\n    Hour 18: [ -2.203, -2.487, -2.061, -2.630 ] -> (-2.203-2.487-2.061-2.630)/4 = (-9.381)/4 = -2.34525\n    Hour 19: [ -2.381, -2.594, -1.919, -2.487 ] -> (-2.381-2.594-1.919-2.487)/4 = (-9.381)/4 = -2.34525  [Note: same as hour18?]\n    Hour 20: [ -2.416, -2.523, -2.132, -2.452 ] -> (-2.416-2.523-2.132-2.452)/4 = (-9.523)/4 = -2.38075\n    Hour 21: [ -2.416, -2.239, -2.559, -3.589 ] -> (-2.416-2.239-2.559-3.589)/4 = (-10.803)/4 = -2.70075\n    Hour 22: [ -1.635, -2.665, -2.310, -2.487 ] -> (-1.635-2.665-2.310-2.487)/4 = (-9.097)/4 = -2.27425\n    Hour 23: [ -0.071, -0.782, -1.599, -0.782 ] -> (-0.071-0.782-1.599-0.782)/4 = (-3.234)/4 = -0.8085\n\n14. Now, we will use these averages for each hour to forecast the next 4 days. The next 96 hours (from 2017-04-11 00:00:00 to 2017-04-14 23:00:00) will be:\n\n    Day5 (2017-04-11): \n        00:00:00 -> -0.009\n        01:00:00 -> -0.19525\n        02:00:00 -> -0.542\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> -0.8085\n\n    Day6 (2017-04-12): same 24 values as above.\n    Day7 (2017-04-13): same.\n    Day8 (2017-04-14): same.\n\n15. We must format the dates accordingly. The data is hourly and the next 96 hours are:\n\n    2017-04-11 00:00:00\n    2017-04-11 01:00:00\n    ...\n    2017-04-11 23:00:00\n    2017-04-12 00:00:00\n    ...\n    2017-04-14 23:00:00\n\n16. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns, 'date' and 'MULL'. The MULL are the averages we computed, rounded to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimal places.\n\n    We note that the computed averages are more precise, but we can round to 3 decimal places.\n\n    However, note: the original data had some integers (like 0.000) and some with 3 decimals. We'll output 3 decimal places.\n\n17. Let's round the averages to 3 decimal places:\n\n    Hour0: -0.009 -> -0.009\n    Hour1: -0.19525 -> -0.195\n    Hour2: -0.542 -> -0.542\n    Hour3: -0.19525 -> -0.195\n    Hour4: -0.22225 -> -0.222\n    Hour5: -0.3555 -> -0.356\n    Hour6: -0.80825 -> -0.808\n    Hour7: 0.1685 -> 0.169\n    Hour8: -0.63975 -> -0.640\n    Hour9: -1.06625 -> -1.066\n    Hour10: -0.86175 -> -0.862\n    Hour11: -0.96825 -> -0.968\n    Hour12: -1.386 -> -1.386\n    Hour13: -1.13725 -> -1.137\n    Hour14: -0.62175 -> -0.622\n    Hour15: -0.9505 -> -0.951\n    Hour16: -1.608 -> -1.608\n    Hour17: -2.0165 -> -2.017\n    Hour18: -2.34525 -> -2.345\n    Hour19: -2.34525 -> -2.345\n    Hour20: -2.38075 -> -2.381\n    Hour21: -2.70075 -> -2.701\n    Hour22: -2.27425 -> -2.274\n    Hour23: -0.8085 -> -0.809\n\n18. Now, we write the next 96 records:\n\n    Start: 2017-04-11 00:00:00 -> MULL: -0.009\n           2017-04-11 01:00:00 -> MULL: -0.195\n           ... and so on.\n\n    Then repeat the same 24 values for the next day, and so on.\n\n19. We must generate 96 rows.\n\n20. Code to generate the dates:\n\n    Start date: 2017-04-11 00:00:00\n    End date: 2017-04-14 23:00:00\n\n    We can generate by:\n\n        base_date = datetime(2017,4,11)\n        for day in range(4): # 4 days\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n                # but note: the first day is 2017-04-11, then 12,13,14.\n\n21. We'll create a list of dates and then assign the MULL value by the hour of the day.\n\n22. We output in the required format.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there were none. We are forecasting without considering any missing value in the future because we are not given any information about future missingness. We assume the next 96 hours are complete.\n\nLet's write the data in the answer block.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format must be:\n\n<answer>\n\n```\n        date                  MULL\n        2017-04-11 00:00:00  -0.009\n        2017-04-11 01:00:00  -0.195\n        ... \n```\n\nWe'll write 96 lines.\n\nWe'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as above.\n\nBut note: the original data had negative zero sometimes? We have positive 0.169, so we output as 0.169.\n\nLet's write the forecast.\n",
