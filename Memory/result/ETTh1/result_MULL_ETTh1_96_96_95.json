        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Middle UseLess Load (MULL) of a transformer.\n The data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 points without explicit missing values. However, the problem states that the data may have missing values, so we should be cautious.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days).\n 2. We must handle any missing values in the provided data. However, the provided 96 points seem complete? Let's check: \n    The data starts at 2017-07-16 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-07-19 23:00:00, which is exactly 96 hours (4 days * 24 hours). \n    There are 96 rows and no NaN in the provided data? But the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we must be prepared.\n\n 3. Since the problem says there might be missing values, we should first check and impute if necessary. However, the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n\n 4. We are to forecast the next 96 hours (from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00).\n\n 5. We choose a time series forecasting method. Given the data is hourly and likely to have daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n 6. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the requirement to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) which can handle seasonality.\n    - Or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) which also handles seasonality.\n\n 7. However, note that the data might have multiple seasonality? But we only have 4 days, so we can only capture daily seasonality (24 periods).\n\n 8. We must also consider that the data might have trends? Let's look at the provided data:\n\n    The data shows:\n      - Daily patterns: for example, on each day, the values are higher during the day (e.g., around 10:00-15:00) and lower at night.\n      - There is also a possible trend? But over 4 days it's hard to tell.\n\n 9. We'll use a model that can handle seasonality. We choose SARIMA because it is flexible.\n\n 10. Steps for SARIMA:\n      - We need to set the seasonal period: s=24 (for 24 hours in a day).\n      - We need to choose the non-seasonal (p,d,q) and seasonal (P,D,Q) parameters.\n\n 11. We can use auto_arima from the pmdarima library to automatically select the best parameters? But since we are not in a Python environment, we have to do it manually or use a simple model.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal model as a baseline. However, the problem does not specify the method.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, we are to provide the forecast. We can use a simple approach: \n      - We'll decompose the time series to remove seasonality and trend, then forecast the residuals? \n      we don't have enough data for that.\n\n 14. Another idea: use a naive seasonal model. For example, the forecast for the next day is the same as the last observed day? \n      But we have 4 days of data, we can average the same hour of the 4 days? \n\n 15. However, the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated method.\n\n 16. We'll use a simple SARIMA model: SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,0,1,24). This is a starting point. But without automatic tuning, we have to assume.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the last day (day 4) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that would be 4 repetitions? \n      However, the problem says to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days). \n\n 18. But note: the data might have a trend? We see that the first day (2017-07-16) and the last day (2017-07-19) have different patterns? \n      Let's compare the same hour:\n\n        Day1 (16th): 00:00 -> 1.173, Day2: 2.061, Day3: 1.066, Day4: 1.706 -> no clear trend.\n\n 19. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without the ability to run code, we are to simulate the output.\n\n 20. However, the problem requires the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must generate 96 forecasted values.\n\n 21. Since we cannot run actual code in this environment, we have to rely on a method that we can compute manually? \n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days. \n\n    For example, for hour 00:00: \n        value1 (16th): 1.173\n        value2 (17th): 2.061\n        value3 (18th): 1.066\n        value4 (19th): 1.706\n        average = (1.173+2.061+1.066+1.706)/4 = 1.5015\n\n    Then for the next 4 days (20th,21st,22nd,23rd) at 00:00, we use 1.5015? But that would be the same for each day? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average pattern and then adjust by the last day's deviation? \n\n 23. Another idea: use the last day (19th) as the base and then adjust by the average of the differences between consecutive days? \n\n 24. Given the time, we must provide an answer. We'll use a simple method: \n      We calculate the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days, and then use that average for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 25. Steps for the next 96 hours (4 days) will be the same 24-hour average pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 26. How to handle if there are missing values in the provided data? We were told to be aware of missing values, but in the provided data there are none. \n      So we proceed.\n\n 27. Calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n 28. Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-07-20 00:00:00 to 2017-07-23 23:00:00), we assign the average for the corresponding hour.\n\n 29. This method is called the seasonal naive method with averaging.\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages:\n\n      Hour 00: (1.173 + 2.061 + 1.066 + 1.706) / 4 = 6.006 / 4 = 1.5015\n      Hour 01: (1.670 + 0.711 + 1.528 + 1.528) / 4 = (1.670+0.711=2.381; 2.381+1.528=3.909; 3.909+1.528=5.437) -> 5.437/4=1.35925\n      ... and so on.\n\n 31. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 32. Then we repeat this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 33. We generate the dates: \n        Start: 2017-07-20 00:00:00 (next after 2017-07-19 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-07-20 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-07-23 23:00:00.\n\n 34. Format: \n        <answer>\n        ```\n        2017-07-20 00:00:00  <value>\n        2017-07-20 01:00:00  <value>\n        ... \n        2017-07-23 23:00:00  <value>\n        ```\n        </answer>\n\n 35. We must provide the complete data.\n\n 36. However, note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but in the provided 96 points we don't have any. \n      So we assume the provided data is complete.\n\n 37.

Let's do the rounding again for clarity:\n\n        Hour0: 1.5015 -> 1.502\n        Hour1: 1.35925 -> 1.359\n        because 1.35925: the 4th decimal is 2, which is less than 5, so we leave as 1.359? \n        But 1.35925 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal (2) -> so 1.359.\n\n        However, let me check: \n          1.35925:\n            thousandths place: 9, next digit is 2 which is <5 -> so 1.359.\n\n        But note: 1.5015: \n          thousandths place: 1, next digit is 5 -> round up the 1 to 2 -> 1.502.\n\n        Similarly, 0.75525: \n          thousandths: 5, next digit 2 -> so 0.755? \n          But wait: 0.75525: \n            the thousandths is 5, and the next digit is 2 (<=5) -> so we leave? \n          rounding rule: if the next digit is 5, then round up. So 0.75525: \n            the digit after thousandths is 2 -> so we leave as 0.755.\n\n        However, 0.75525 is 0.755 when rounded to 3 decimals? \n\n        But 0.089: remains 0.089.\n\n        We'll round half to even? But for simplicity, we round to the nearest, and if exactly 0.0005, round to the nearest even? \n        But we don't have to be too strict. We'll round to 3 decimals as follows:\n\n          value = round(x, 3)\n\n        We'll do:\n\n          Hour0: 1.5015 -> 1.502\n          Hour1: 1.35925 -> 1.359\n          because 1.35925 * 1000 = 1359.25 -> round to integer 1359 -> then 1.359\n          but 1.5015 * 1000 = 1501.5 -> round to 1502 -> 1.502\n\n        We do:\n\n          Hour3: 0 -> 0.000\n          Hour4: 0.089 -> 0.089\n          Hour5: 0.453 -> 0.453\n          Hour6: -0.231 -> -0.231\n          Hour7: 0.66625 -> 0.666 (because 0.66625 * 1000 = 666.25 -> round to 666 -> 0.666)\n          Hour8: 0.6395 -> 0.640 (because 0.6395 * 1000 = 639.5 -> round to 640 -> 0.640)\n          Hour9: 0.91475 -> 0.915 (0.91475 * 1000 = 914.75 -> round to 915 -> 0.915)\n          Hour10: 1.66125 -> 1.661 (1.661)\n          Hour11: 3.0205 -> 3.021 (3.0205 -> 3.021 because 020.5 -> round up to 021)\n          Hour12: 1.61675 -> 1.617 (1.61675 -> 1.617)\n          Hour13: 1.9455 -> 1.946 (1.9455 -> 1.946)\n          Hour14: 1.528 -> 1.528\n          Hour15: 1.075 -> 1.075\n          Hour16: 0.444 -> 0.444\n          Hour17: -0.098 -> -0.098\n          Hour18: -0.97725 -> -0.977\n          Hour19: -1.075 -> -1.075\n          Hour20: -0.5065 -> -0.507 (because -0.5065: rounding 506.5 -> 507, so -0.507)\n          Hour21: -1.19025 -> -1.190\n          Hour22: -0.44425 -> -0.444\n          Hour23: 0.213 -> 0.213\n\n 52. We write the data accordingly.\n\n 53. We generate the next 96 hours.\n\n 54. We note: the dates are in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n 55. We write the answer.\n",
