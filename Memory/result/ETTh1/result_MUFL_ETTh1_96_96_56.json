        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for MUFL (Middle Useful Load) from 2017-02-10 00:00:00 to 2017-02-13 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of MUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we assume the provided data is complete and we will handle any potential missing values in the input by imputation if necessary. But note: the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we are to be cautious. Since the provided 96 points are complete, we proceed.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. The last timestamp is 2017-02-13 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2017-02-14 00:00:00 to 2017-02-17 23:00:00.\n\n 3. We must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates in the same hourly frequency.\n\n 4. Since the data shows a clear daily seasonality (with peaks and troughs at similar hours each day) and also a trend, we can use a time series model that captures seasonality and trend.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a model such as SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) to capture the daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24 hours).\n\n However, note that the data is only 96 points (4 days) and we are to forecast 96 points (next 4 days). With such a short history, complex models might not be robust.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n   - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual.\n   - Extrapolate the trend and then add the seasonal component.\n\n But given the short history, we can also consider a naive seasonal model: \n   - Use the average of each hour of the day from the available 4 days to form a daily profile, and then use that profile for the next 4 days.\n\n However, note that the data might have a trend. Let's check the last 4 days:\n\n   We have 4 days: 2017-02-10, 2017-02-11, 2017-02-12, 2017-02-13.\n\n   We can compute the daily average and see if there is a trend:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-02-10): average = (6.929+6.041+...+7.995)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n        The values range from -11.122 to 9.523 -> average might be around 0? Actually, we can calculate:\n\n        We can compute the daily averages for the 4 days:\n\n        Day1 (2017-02-10): \n            Sum = 6.929+6.041+5.579+5.224+4.975+4.975+5.295+5.970+4.584+(-1.919)+(-5.863)+(-8.848)+(-11.122)+(-10.483)+(-9.097)+(-6.503)+0.355+6.005+7.214+9.204+9.523+9.061+8.102+7.995\n            = 6.929+6.041=12.97, +5.579=18.549, +5.224=23.773, +4.975=28.748, +4.975=33.723, +5.295=39.018, +5.970=44.988, +4.584=49.572, -1.919=47.653, -5.863=41.79, -8.848=32.942, -11.122=21.82, -10.483=11.337, -9.097=2.24, -6.503=-4.263, +0.355=-3.908, +6.005=2.097, +7.214=9.311, +9.204=18.515, +9.523=28.038, +9.061=37.099, +8.102=45.201, +7.995=53.196\n            Average = 53.196 / 24 = 2.2165\n\n        Day2 (2017-02-11): \n            Sum = 7.107+7.356+6.681+6.254+5.437+4.726+6.716+6.645+3.767+(-2.594)+(-6.574)+(-8.315)+(-9.346)+(-10.874)+(-9.061)+(-4.691)+(-1.883)+4.371+6.645+8.635+8.777+8.493+7.604+6.254\n            = 7.107+7.356=14.463, +6.681=21.144, +6.254=27.398, +5.437=32.835, +4.726=37.561, +6.716=44.277, +6.645=50.922, +3.767=54.689, -2.594=52.095, -6.574=45.521, -8.315=37.206, -9.346=27.86, -10.874=16.986, -9.061=7.925, -4.691=3.234, -1.883=1.351, +4.371=5.722, +6.645=12.367, +8.635=21.002, +8.777=29.779, +8.493=38.272, +7.604=45.876, +6.254=52.13\n            Average = 52.13 / 24 = 2.172083\n\n        Day3 (2017-02-12): \n            Sum = 5.934+4.477+4.762+5.828+3.873+5.543+5.970+6.503+3.411+(-2.843)+(-6.681)+(-8.173)+(-10.021)+(-9.808)+(-8.564)+(-6.112)+(-2.203)+4.762+5.828+7.214+7.462+7.320+8.919+8.706\n            = 5.934+4.477=10.411, +4.762=15.173, +5.828=21.001, +3.873=24.874, +5.543=30.417, +5.970=36.387, +6.503=42.89, +3.411=46.301, -2.843=43.458, -6.681=36.777, -8.173=28.604, -10.021=18.583, -9.808=8.775, -8.564=0.211, -6.112=-5.901, -2.203=-8.104, +4.762=-3.342, +5.828=2.486, +7.214=9.7, +7.462=17.162, +7.320=24.482, +8.919=33.401, +8.706=42.107\n            Average = 42.107 / 24 = 1.754458\n\n        Day4 (2017-02-13): \n            Sum = 8.706+7.818+7.782+7.853+7.178+6.681+6.929+8.919+5.472+0.213+(-5.543)+(-7.391)+(-9.914)+(-9.381)+(-8.315)+(-5.863)+(-1.173)+4.513+5.188+6.467+6.645+6.681+7.640+7.604\n            = 8.706+7.818=16.524, +7.782=24.306, +7.853=32.159, +7.178=39.337, +6.681=46.018, +6.929=52.947, +8.919=61.866, +5.472=67.338, +0.213=67.551, -5.543=62.008, -7.391=54.617, -9.914=44.703, -9.381=35.322, -8.315=27.007, -5.863=21.144, -1.173=19.971, +4.513=24.484, +5.188=29.672, +6.467=36.139, +6.645=42.784, +6.681=49.465, +7.640=57.105, +7.604=64.709\n            Average = 64.709 / 24 = 2.696208\n\n        The daily averages: \n          2017-02-10: 2.2165\n          2017-02-11: 2.172083\n          2017-02-12: 1.754458\n          2017-02-13: 2.696208\n\n        There is no clear downward or upward trend over these 4 days. So we can assume the level is relatively stable.\n\n 5. Therefore, we can use a seasonal naive approach: \n        For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n    However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days (all in a row) and we are forecasting the next 4 days (which would be Tuesday to Friday, then the next 4 days would be Wednesday to Saturday? Actually, 2017-02-10 is Friday, 2017-02-11 Saturday, 2017-02-12 Sunday, 2017-02-13 Monday. Then the next 4 days: 2017-02-14 Tuesday, 2017-02-15 Wednesday, 2017-02-16 Thursday, 2017-02-17 Friday.\n\n    Since we don't have data for Tuesday to Friday in the next week, we can only average the same hour across the 4 days we have? But note: the pattern on Friday (2017-02-10) might be different from Monday (2017-02-13). However, we have only one Friday and one Monday. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the entire 4 days to form an average daily profile and use that for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 6. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0: (6.929 + 7.107 + 5.934 + 8.706) / 4 = (6.929+7.107=14.036, +5.934=19.97, +8.706=28.676) -> 28.676/4 = 7.169\n    Hour 1: (6.041+7.356+4.477+7.818) = (6.041+7.356=13.397, +4.477=17.874, +7.818=25.692) -> 25.692/4 = 6.423\n    ... and so on.\n\n 7. But note: the data might have a slight trend? We could also adjust by the overall level. However, the daily averages are not showing a clear trend. Alternatively, we can use the last day (Monday) as the base and then adjust by the average daily profile? \n\n 8. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 4 days, we will use the average of each hour over the 4 days to form the daily pattern and then use that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 9. Steps for forecasting:\n      For each hour h in [0,23]:\n          value_h = average of the h-th hour from the 4 days.\n\n      Then for the next 4 days, for each day d (from 2017-02-14 to 2017-02-17) and for each hour h, the forecast is value_h.\n\n 10. However, note that the last day (2017-02-13) has a higher average than the others. But without a clear trend, we stick to the average.\n\n 11. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values.\n\n      Hour 0: [6.929, 7.107, 5.934, 8.706] -> mean = (6.929+7.107+5.934+8.706)/4 = 7.169\n      Hour 1: [6.041, 7.356, 4.477, 7.818] -> (6.041+7.356+4.477+7.818)/4 = 6.423\n      Hour 2: [5.579, 6.681, 4.762, 7.782] -> (5.579+6.681+4.762+7.782)/4 = 6.201\n      Hour 3: [5.224, 6.254, 5.828, 7.853] -> (5.224+6.254+5.828+7.853)/4 = 6.28975\n      Hour 4: [4.975, 5.437, 3.873, 7.178] -> (4.975+5.437+3.873+7.178)/4 = 5.36575\n      Hour 5: [4.975, 4.726, 5.543, 6.681] -> (4.975+4.726+5.543+6.681)/4 = 5.48125\n      Hour 6: [5.295, 6.716, 5.970, 6.929] -> (5.295+6.716+5.970+6.929)/4 = 6.2275\n      Hour 7: [5.970, 6.645, 6.503, 8.919] -> (5.970+6.645+6.503+8.919)/4 = 7.00925\n      Hour 8: [4.584, 3.767, 3.411, 5.472] -> (4.584+3.767+3.411+5.472)/4 = 4.3085\n      Hour 9: [-1.919, -2.594, -2.843, 0.213] -> (-1.919-2.594-2.843+0.213)/4 = -6.143/4 = -1.53575\n      Hour 10: [-5.863, -6.574, -6.681, -5.543] -> (-5.863-6.574-6.681-5.543)/4 = -24.661/4 = -6.16525\n      Hour 11: [-8.848, -8.315, -8.173, -7.391] -> (-8.848-8.315-8.173-7.391)/4 = -32.727/4 = -8.18175\n      Hour 12: [-11.122, -9.346, -10.021, -9.914] -> (-11.122-9.346-10.021-9.914)/4 = -40.403/4 = -10.10075\n      Hour 13: [-10.483, -10.874, -9.808, -9.381] -> (-10.483-10.874-9.808-9.381)/4 = -40.546/4 = -10.1365\n      Hour 14: [-9.097, -9.061, -8.564, -8.315] -> (-9.097-9.061-8.564-8.315)/4 = -35.037/4 = -8.75925\n      Hour 15: [-6.503, -4.691, -6.112, -5.863] -> (-6.503-4.691-6.112-5.863)/4 = -23.169/4 = -5.79225\n      Hour 16: [0.355, -1.883, -2.203, -1.173] -> (0.355-1.883-2.203-1.173)/4 = -4.904/4 = -1.226\n      Hour 17: [6.005, 4.371, 4.762, 4.513] -> (6.005+4.371+4.762+4.513)/4 = 19.651/4 = 4.91275\n      Hour 18: [7.214, 6.645, 5.828, 5.188] -> (7.214+6.645+5.828+5.188)/4 = 24.875/4 = 6.21875\n      Hour 19: [9.204, 8.635, 7.214, 6.467] -> (9.204+8.635+7.214+6.467)/4 = 31.52/4 = 7.88\n      Hour 20: [9.523, 8.777, 7.462, 6.645] -> (9.523+8.777+7.462+6.645)/4 = 32.407/4 = 8.10175\n      Hour 21: [9.061, 8.493, 7.320, 6.681] -> (9.061+8.493+7.320+6.681)/4 = 31.555/4 = 7.88875\n      Hour 22: [8.102, 7.604, 8.919, 7.640] -> (8.102+7.604+8.919+7.640)/4 = 32.265/4 = 8.06625\n      Hour 23: [7.995, 6.254, 8.706, 7.604] -> (7.995+6.254+8.706+7.604)/4 = 30.559/4 = 7.63975\n\n 12.

We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 16. However, note: the input data has negative values and we are averaging, so we keep the sign.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n   Hour 0: 7.169 -> 7.169\n   Hour 1: 6.423 -> 6.423\n   Hour 2: 6.201 -> 6.201\n   Hour 3: 6.28975 -> 6.290 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n   Hour 4: 5.36575 -> 5.366\n   Hour 5: 5.48125 -> 5.481\n   Hour 6: 6.2275 -> 6.228\n   Hour 7: 7.00925 -> 7.009\n   Hour 8: 4.3085 -> 4.309\n   Hour 9: -1.53575 -> -1.536\n   Hour 10: -6.16525 -> -6.165\n   Hour 11: -8.18175 -> -8.182\n   Hour 12: -10.10075 -> -10.101\n   Hour 13: -10.1365 -> -10.137\n   Hour 14: -8.75925 -> -8.759\n   Hour 15: -5.79225 -> -5.792\n   Hour 16: -1.226 -> -1.226\n   Hour 17: 4.91275 -> 4.913\n   Hour 18: 6.21875 -> 6.219\n   Hour 19: 7.88 -> 7.880\n   Hour 20: 8.10175 -> 8.102\n   Hour 21: 7.88875 -> 7.889\n   Hour 22: 8.06625 -> 8.066\n   Hour 23: 7.63975 -> 7.640\n\n 17. Now, we generate the next 96 points by repeating the same 24-hour pattern for 4 days.\n\n 18. The first forecasted day: 2017-02-14 (Tuesday) starting at 00:00:00.\n\n 19. We write the data in the same way as the input.\n\n 20. Note: the input data has the 'date' in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' and the MUFL value as a float with 3 decimal places.\n\n 21. We generate:\n\n        2017-02-14 00:00:00   7.169\n        2017-02-14 01:00:00   6.423\n        2017-02-14 02:00:00   6.201\n        2017-02-14 03:00:00   6.290\n        ... until\n        2017-02-14 23:00:00   7.640\n\n        then 2017-02-15 00:00:00   7.169\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. We must write 96 lines.\n\n 23. Let's code the generation:\n\n      base_date = \"2017-02-14\"\n      We'll create a list of dates for the next 4 days, starting at 00:00:00 and then every hour.\n\n      We can use:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        But since we are not coding, we do manually.\n\n      The next 4 days:\n\n        Day 1: 2017-02-14 (Tuesday)\n        Day 2: 2017-02-15 (Wednesday)\n        Day 3: 2017-02-16 (Thursday)\n        Day 4: 2017-02-17 (Friday)\n\n      We have the 24 values for the day: [v0, v1, ... v23]\n\n      Then for each day in [14,15,16,17] of February 2017, and for hour in 0 to 23:\n\n          date_str = f\"2017-02-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n      But note: the day must be two-digit: 14, 16, 17 -> already two-digit.\n\n      However, we have to generate the dates in order.\n\n 24. We write:\n\n        for day_offset in [0,1,2,3]:\n            day = 14 + day_offset\n            for hour in range(0,24):\n                date = f\"2017-02-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                value = pattern[hour]   # pattern is the list of 24 values we computed\n\n 25. But note: the pattern we computed is for the 24 hours in order.\n\n 26. We output the data in the same format.\n\n 27. However, note: the input data has the date string exactly as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", so we must use two-digit for the day and hour.\n\n 28. Since 14,15,16,17 are two-digit, we can write:\n\n        \"2017-02-14\", \"2017-02-15\", \"2017-02-16\", \"2017-02-17\"\n\n 29. We'll generate the 96 lines.\n\n 30. We must be cautious: the hour in the string must be two-digit: e.g., 00, 01, ... 23.\n\n 31. Let's write the complete forecast.\n\n 32. We'll round the values to 3 decimal places as we computed.\n\n 33. The pattern list (rounded to 3 decimals) for 24 hours:\n\n        [7.169, 6.423, 6.201, 6.290, 5.366, 5.481, 6.228, 7.009, 4.309, -1.536, -6.165, -8.182, -10.101, -10.137, -8.759, -5.792, -1.226, 4.913, 6.219, 7.880, 8.102, 7.889, 8.066, 7.640]\n\n 34. Now, we generate the 96 lines.\n\n 35. We write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-02-14 00:00:00   7.169\n2017-02-14 01:00:00   6.423\n2017-02-14 02:00:00   6.201\n2017-02-14 03:00:00   6.290\n2017-02-14 04:00:00   5.366\n2017-02-14 05:00:00   5.481\n2017-02-14 06:00:00   6.228\n2017-02-14 07:00:00   7.009\n2017-02-14 08:00:00   4.309\n2017-02-14 09:00:00  -1.536\n2017-02-14 10:00:00  -6.165\n2017-02-14 11:00:00  -8.182\n2017-02-14 12:00:00 -10.101\n2017-02-14 13:00:00 -10.137\n2017-02-14 14:00:00  -8.759\n2017-02-14 15:00:00  -5.792\n2017-02-14 16:00:00  -1.226\n2017-02-14 17:00:00   4.913\n2017-02-14 18:00:00   6.219\n2017-02-14 19:00:00   7.880\n2017-02-14 20:00:00   8.102\n2017-02-14 21:00:00   7.889\n2017-02-14 22:00:00   8.066\n2017-02-14 23:00:00   7.640\n2017-02-15 00:00:00   7.169\n2017-02-15 01:00:00   6.423\n...

Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and we are to output 96 lines.\n\n 40. We are done.\n\n However, note: this is a simple average model. In practice, we might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA or Prophet) but with only 4 days of data, it's hard to fit such models. The average model is a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's output the data.\n",
