        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for LUFL (Low UseFul Load) from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we are to forecast 96 points and the forecast must be complete.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points (4 days) and the data has hourly frequency, we can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any)\n   - Seasonality (daily: 24 periods)\n\n Given the limited data (only 4 days) and the requirement for 4 days forecast, we can use a simple seasonal model.\n\n However, note: the data shows a pattern that repeats every day but with some variation.\n\n We can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day (or an average of the same hour over the past days).\n   - But note: the pattern on 2017-10-11 (the last day) is different from the previous days (it has a drop in the end). \n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n But let's look at the data:\n\n   Day 1 (2017-10-08): \n        00:00: 1.828, 23:00: 2.224\n   Day 2 (2017-10-09): \n        00:00: 1.980, 23:00: 2.102\n   Day 3 (2017-10-10): \n        00:00: 1.858, 23:00: 2.163\n   Day 4 (2017-10-11): \n        00:00: 2.224, 23:00: 1.736\n\n We can see that the load varies by day. Since we are forecasting the next 4 days (which would be from 2017-10-12 to 2017-10-15),\n we can consider using the average of the same hour for the past 4 days.\n\n However, note that the last day (2017-10-11) has a drop in the evening. We don't know if that is a trend or just a random fluctuation.\n\n Given the short history, a reasonable approach is to use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days.\n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. However, the provided 96 points are complete.\n\n We are to produce 96 points without any missing values.\n\n Plan:\n   For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we will compute the average of that hour over the 4 available days.\n\n   Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will assign:\n        Day 5 (2017-10-12): for hour h, use the average of hour h from Day1, Day2, Day3, Day4.\n        Day 6 (2017-10-13): same as Day 5? But we don't have more days. Alternatively, we can use the same average for all 4 forecast days.\n\n   However, note: the problem does not specify any long-term trend, and with only 4 days, we cannot model a weekly pattern.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the same daily pattern (the average of the 4 days) for each of the next 4 days.\n\n Steps in code (if we were to code) but we are to output the data.\n\n But note: the dates must be generated as well.\n\n Start from: \n        Last date in the given data: 2017-10-11 23:00:00\n        Next date: 2017-10-12 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n\n How to compute the average for hour h:\n\n   Let h in [0,23]\n\n   For h=0 (midnight):\n        Day1: 1.828\n        Day2: 1.980\n        Day3: 1.858\n        Day4: 2.224\n        Average = (1.828 + 1.980 + 1.858 + 2.224) / 4 = 1.9725\n\n   Similarly for h=1, ... h=23.\n\n   Then for each day in the forecast period (4 days), the hour 0 will be 1.9725, hour 1 will be the average of the four days at hour 1, etc.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and compute the average.\n\n   Then, for the 4 forecast days, we repeat the same 24-hour pattern.\n\n   However, note: the last day (2017-10-11) has a drop. We are averaging so it will be smoothed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-10-11) as the pattern for the next day? But that might not be better.\n\n   Since we don't have a clear trend, averaging is a safe approach.\n\n   Let's compute the averages:\n\n        hour0: [1.828, 1.980, 1.858, 2.224] -> (1.828+1.980+1.858+2.224)/4 = 7.89/4 = 1.9725\n        hour1: [1.767, 1.980, 1.888, 2.102] -> (1.767+1.980+1.888+2.102)/4 = 7.737/4 = 1.93425\n        hour2: [1.767, 1.858, 1.675, 1.858] -> (1.767+1.858+1.675+1.858)/4 = 7.158/4 = 1.7895\n        hour3: [1.797, 2.132, 1.736, 1.858] -> (1.797+2.132+1.736+1.858)/4 = 7.523/4 = 1.88075\n        hour4: [1.828, 1.736, 2.224, 2.041] -> (1.828+1.736+2.224+2.041)/4 = 7.829/4 = 1.95725\n        hour5: [2.163, 2.193, 2.528, 2.254] -> (2.163+2.193+2.528+2.254)/4 = 9.138/4 = 2.2845\n        hour6: [2.711, 3.076, 3.168, 2.528] -> (2.711+3.076+3.168+2.528)/4 = 11.483/4 = 2.87075\n        hour7: [2.741, 2.680, 2.741, 2.772] -> (2.741+2.680+2.741+2.772)/4 = 10.934/4 = 2.7335\n        hour8: [2.741, 2.193, 2.498, 2.619] -> (2.741+2.193+2.498+2.619)/4 = 10.051/4 = 2.51275\n        hour9: [2.284, 2.254, 2.467, 2.498] -> (2.284+2.254+2.467+2.498)/4 = 9.503/4 = 2.37575\n        hour10: [2.680, 2.589, 2.772, 2.650] -> (2.680+2.589+2.772+2.650)/4 = 10.691/4 = 2.67275\n        hour11: [2.894, 2.863, 2.985, 2.863] -> (2.894+2.863+2.985+2.863)/4 = 11.605/4 = 2.90125\n        hour12: [1.980, 2.102, 2.102, 2.224] -> (1.980+2.102+2.102+2.224)/4 = 8.408/4 = 2.102\n        hour13: [1.675, 1.949, 2.132, 2.132] -> (1.675+1.949+2.132+2.132)/4 = 7.888/4 = 1.972\n        hour14: [1.919, 1.919, 2.163, 2.071] -> (1.919+1.919+2.163+2.071)/4 = 8.072/4 = 2.018\n        hour15: [1.828, 1.888, 2.163, 2.071] -> (1.828+1.888+2.163+2.071)/4 = 7.95/4 = 1.9875\n        hour16: [2.132, 2.071, 2.224, 2.376] -> (2.132+2.071+2.224+2.376)/4 = 8.803/4 = 2.20075\n        hour17: [2.528, 2.619, 2.315, 2.315] -> (2.528+2.619+2.315+2.315)/4 = 9.777/4 = 2.44425\n        hour18: [2.376, 2.863, 2.863, 2.132] -> (2.376+2.863+2.863+2.132)/4 = 10.234/4 = 2.5585\n        hour19: [2.894, 2.924, 2.802, 2.041] -> (2.894+2.924+2.802+2.041)/4 = 10.661/4 = 2.66525\n        hour20: [2.498, 2.833, 2.376, 1.767] -> (2.498+2.833+2.376+1.767)/4 = 9.474/4 = 2.3685\n        hour21: [2.437, 2.163, 2.680, 1.614] -> (2.437+2.163+2.680+1.614)/4 = 8.894/4 = 2.2235\n        hour22: [1.980, 1.949, 1.858, 1.736] -> (1.980+1.949+1.858+1.736)/4 = 7.523/4 = 1.88075\n        hour23: [2.224, 2.102, 2.163, 1.736] -> (2.224+2.102+2.163+1.736)/4 = 8.225/4 = 2.05625\n\n   Then, the forecast for:\n        2017-10-12 00:00:00 -> 1.9725\n        2017-10-12 01:00:00 -> 1.93425\n        ... and so on for 24 hours of Oct 12.\n\n   Then for Oct 13, 14, 15: same pattern.\n\n   But note: we are to output 96 points (4 days * 24 hours).\n\n   We'll generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-10-12 00:00:00\n        End: 2017-10-15 23:00:00\n\n   We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the forecast we are to provide complete data.\n\n   We are not given any missing values in the input, and we are creating the forecast without gaps.\n\n   We'll output the data in the same format: two columns (date and LUFL), with the date in the format as string.\n\n   We'll round the LUFL to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the input has 3 decimal places.
