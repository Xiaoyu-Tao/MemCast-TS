        "reasoning": "We are given 96 historical data points (from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00) of oil temperature (OT) in a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 time points (i.e., from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 onwards, at the same hourly frequency).\n\n However, note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values.\n\n Since we are to forecast the next 96 points, we must generate 96 new data points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note the data is hourly and we have 96 points (4 days * 24 hours = 96).\n 2. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the historical data? But in the provided data, we see that for 2016-10-31, the temperature is constant (13.155) for 24 hours. This might be an anomaly or missing data? However, the problem says the data will have missing values. But in the given 96 points, we don't have any explicit NaN. So we assume the provided data is as is.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the data, we can try to model the daily seasonality (since there seems to be a pattern over 24 hours).\n\n 4. Since the data is short (only 96 points) and we are to forecast 96 points (next 4 days), we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend: The overall trend in the data? Looking at the data, it's not clear if there is a long-term trend in just 4 days.\n    - Seasonality: There is a clear daily pattern (24 hours).\n\n 5. We note that the last day (2016-11-01) shows a pattern that is different from the previous days? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 6. We can use a seasonal model. One simple approach is to use the last available day (2016-11-01) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that might not account for any trend.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days? But note that the data on 2016-10-31 is constant, which is likely an anomaly. So we might want to use the other days.\n\n 8. Let's break down the data:\n    Day 1: 2016-10-29 (Saturday)\n    Day 2: 2016-10-30 (Sunday)\n    Day 3: 2016-10-31 (Monday) -> constant value (suspicious)\n    Day 4: 2016-11-01 (Tuesday)\n\n 9. Since 2016-10-31 is constant, we might consider using the other days for pattern. But we have only 3 non-constant days? And the last day (2016-11-01) might be the most relevant.\n\n 10. We are to forecast the next 4 days: 2016-11-02 (Wednesday) to 2016-11-05 (Saturday).\n\n 11. Given the constraints, we can use a method such as:\n     - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day? But the previous day (2016-11-01) is a Tuesday and we are forecasting a Wednesday? So we might use the same day of the week? But we don't have enough data for same day of the week.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last 3 non-constant days? But note that 2016-10-31 is constant and might be an error. So we can use:\n     - 2016-10-29 (Saturday), 2016-10-30 (Sunday), and 2016-11-01 (Tuesday) for the same hour? But they are different days of the week.\n\n 13. Since we have only 4 days and one of them is constant, we might use the most recent day (2016-11-01) and repeat it for the next 4 days? But that would ignore any weekly pattern and also the fact that the next days are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n\n 14. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the two days that are not constant (2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, and 2016-11-01) and then adjust by the difference between consecutive days? But that might be complex.\n\n 15. Given the simplicity and the data, we can do:\n     - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour from the last two non-constant days (2016-10-30 and 2016-11-01) and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next days? But note that 2016-10-29 is also non-constant, but it's a Saturday and we are forecasting a Wednesday? So we might avoid it.\n\n 16. However, the problem does not specify the day of the week effect. We have only 4 days and they are consecutive? Actually, 2016-10-29 (Sat), 2016-10-30 (Sun), 2016-10-31 (Mon), 2016-11-01 (Tue). The next days are 2016-11-02 (Wed), 2016-11-03 (Thu), 2016-11-04 (Fri), 2016-11-05 (Sat).\n\n 17. We note that the constant day (2016-10-31) is Monday. We don't have data for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n 18. Given the lack of data, we can use the average of the available days for the same hour? But we have only 3 non-constant days? Actually, 2016-10-31 is constant and we should not use it? So we have 3 days: 2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, 2016-11-01.\n\n 19. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over these three days? But the days of the week are different. However, we don't have a better option.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2016-11-01) and then adjust by the average daily change? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 21. Let's try to see the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (8.723 + 13.647 + 8.512) / 3 = 10.294\n     Hour 1: (9.708 + 13.296 + 9.075) / 3 = 10.693\n     ... and so on.\n\n 22. But note: the data on 2016-10-29 and 2016-10-30 are weekend days, and 2016-11-01 is a Tuesday. The next days include a Saturday (2016-11-05) so we might want to use the Saturday pattern for that day? But we have only one Saturday (2016-10-29) and one Sunday (2016-10-30). We don't have a Tuesday pattern for the next week? But we are forecasting the next 4 days: Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat.\n\n 23. Given the complexity and the fact that we are not given any external variables (like load) and the data is very limited, we decide to use the average of the three non-constant days for each hour to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 24. However, note that the problem says the data will have missing values. We are not told how to handle missing values in the historical data? But in the given 96 points, we don't have missing values?\n     The constant day (2016-10-31) might be considered as missing? But it's provided as 13.155 for every hour. We can treat that day as an anomaly and not use it.\n\n 25. So we will use the three days: 2016-10-29, 2016-10-30, 2016-11-01 to compute the average for each hour.\n\n 26. Steps for forecasting:\n     For hour h (0 to 23) in the day:\n        value_h = ( value_{day1, h} + value_{day2, h} + value_{day3, h} ) / 3\n\n     Then we repeat this pattern for the next 4 days? But note: the next 4 days are 4 * 24 = 96 hours.\n\n 27. However, we must account for the fact that the pattern might change with the day of the week? But we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality.\n\n 28. Therefore, we will use the same average pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n 29. But note: the last day in our historical data is 2016-11-01 (Tuesday). The next day is 2016-11-02 (Wednesday). We are forecasting 4 days: 2016-11-02, 2016-11-03, 2016-11-04, 2016-11-05.\n\n 30. We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n 31. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (8.723 + 13.647 + 8.512) / 3 = 10.294\n     Hour 1: (9.708 + 13.296 + 9.075) / 3 = 10.693\n     Hour 2: (7.738 + 13.929 + 8.653) / 3 = 10.1067\n     Hour 3: (6.824 + 12.733 + 8.793) / 3 = 9.45\n     Hour 4: (5.698 + 13.296 + 8.864) / 3 = 9.286\n     Hour 5: (4.995 + 11.889 + 9.215) / 3 = 8.6997\n     Hour 6: (4.854 + 11.467 + 9.778) / 3 = 8.6997\n     Hour 7: (6.824 + 11.959 + 10.271) / 3 = 9.6847\n     Hour 8: (4.643 + 11.256 + 9.989) / 3 = 8.6293\n     Hour 9: (4.502 + 11.607 + 10.130) / 3 = 8.7463\n     Hour 10: (8.371 + 11.889 + 10.411) / 3 = 10.2237\n     Hour 11: (9.075 + 12.240 + 10.271) / 3 = 10.5287\n     Hour 12: (10.482 + 13.366 + 10.904) / 3 = 11.584\n     Hour 13: (10.833 + 13.225 + 11.678) / 3 = 11.912\n     Hour 14: (10.271 + 13.999 + 12.311) / 3 = 12.1937\n     Hour 15: (9.215 + 14.491 + 12.803) / 3 = 12.1697\n     Hour 16: (9.778 + 14.632 + 12.803) / 3 = 12.4043\n     Hour 17: (9.778 + 15.547 + 12.311) / 3 = 12.5453\n     Hour 18: (9.989 + 15.406 + 11.748) / 3 = 12.381\n     Hour 19: (10.200 + 15.687 + 11.748) / 3 = 12.545\n     Hour 20: (12.029 + 13.296 + 12.592) / 3 = 12.639\n     Hour 21: (12.170 + 12.592 + 11.818) / 3 = 12.1933\n     Hour 22: (11.467 + 12.311 + 11.678) / 3 = 11.8187\n     Hour 23: (13.999 + 12.803 + 11.748) / 3 = 12.85\n\n 32. Then we repeat this pattern for 4 days.\n\n 33. The next 96 dates start from 2016-11-02 00:00:00 and go hourly until 2016-11-05 23:00:00.\n\n 34. We must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and OT) for 96 rows.\n\n 35. However, note that the problem says the data will have missing values. But we are generating a forecast without missing values? The problem says \"remember to give me the complete data\". So we are to provide the 96 forecasted points without any missing values.\n\n 36. Therefore, we output 96 rows with the date and the forecasted OT value.\n\n 37. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 38. Let's write the data:\n\n     First day (2016-11-02, Wednesday):\n        00:00:00 -> 10.294\n        01:00:00 -> 10.693\n        ... until 23:00:00 -> 12.85\n\n     Then the next day (2016-11-03, Thursday): same pattern\n        00:00:00 -> 10.294\n        ... \n\n     And so on for 4 days.\n\n 39. But note: the problem does not to omit any content, so we must output all 96.\n\n 40. We'll generate the dates programmatically.\n\n 41. However, note that the last date in the input is 2016-11-01 23:00:00. The next date is 2016-11-02 00:00:00.\n\n 42. We'll create 96 rows starting from 2016-11-02 00:00:00, then 2016-11-02 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-11-05 23:00:00.\n\n 43. The forecasted values for each day are the 24 averages we computed above, repeated for 4 days.\n\n 44. We write the answer in the required markdown format.\n\n 45. Let's code the output.\n\n 46. We note: the average values we computed are:\n\n        hour0: 10.294\n        hour1: 10.693\n        hour2: 10.1067 -> 10.107 (rounded to 3 decimals)\n        ... \n\n     We'll round each to 3 decimal places.\n\n 47. We recalculate and round:\n\n        hour0: (8.723+13.647+8.512)/3 = (30.882)/3 = 10.294 -> 10.294\n        hour1: (9.708+13.296+9.075)/3 = (32.079)/3 = 10.693 -> 10.693\n        hour2: (7.738+13.929+8.653)/3 = (30.32)/3 = 10.106666... -> 10.107\n        hour3: (6.824+12.733+8.793)/3 = (28.35)/3 = 9.45 -> 9.450\n        hour4: (5.698+13.296+8.864)/3 = (27.858)/3 = 9.286 -> 9.286\n        hour5: (4.995+11.889+9.215)/3 = (26.099)/3 = 8.699666... -> 8.700\n        hour6: (4.854+11.467+9.778)/3 = (26.099)/3 = 8.699666... -> 8.700\n        hour7: (6.824+11.959+10.271)/3 = (29.054)/3 = 9.684666... -> 9.685\n        hour8: (4.643+11.256+9.989)/3 = (25.888)/3 = 8.629333... -> 8.629\n        hour9: (4.502+11.607+10.130)/3 = (26.239)/3 = 8.746333... -> 8.746\n        hour10: (8.371+11.889+10.411)/3 = (30.671)/3 = 10.223666... -> 10.224\n        hour11: (9.075+12.240+10.271)/3 = (31.586)/3 = 10.528666... -> 10.529\n        hour12: (10.482+13.366+10.904)/3 = (34.752)/3 = 11.584 -> 11.584\n        hour13: (10.833+13.225+11.678)/3 = (35.736)/3 = 11.912 -> 11.912\n        hour14: (10.271+13.999+12.311)/3 = (36.581)/3 = 12.193666... -> 12.194\n        hour15: (9.215+14.491+12.803)/3 = (36.509)/3 = 12.169666... -> 12.170\n        hour16: (9.778+14.632+12.803)/3 = (37.213)/3 = 12.404333... -> 12.404\n        hour17: (9.778+15.547+12.311)/3 = (37.636)/3 = 12.545333... -> 12.545\n        hour18: (9.989+15.406+11.748)/3 = (37.143)/3 = 12.381 -> 12.381\n        hour19: (10.200+15.687+11.748)/3 = (37.635)/3 = 12.545 -> 12.545\n        hour20: (12.029+13.296+12.592)/3 = (37.917)/3 = 12.639 -> 12.639\n        hour21: (12.170+12.592+11.818)/3 = (36.58)/3 = 12.193333... -> 12.193\n        hour22: (11.467+12.311+11.678)/3 = (35.456)/3 = 11.818666... -> 11.819\n        hour23: (13.999+12.803+11.748)/3 = (38.55)/3 = 12.85 -> 12.850\n\n 48. Now we have 24 values for one day.\n\n 49. We will repeat these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n 50. We generate the dates:\n\n        Day 1: 2016-11-02\n        Day 2: 2016-11-03\n        Day 3: 2016-11-04\n        Day 4: 2016-11-05\n\n 51. We write the data in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-11-02 00:00:00  10.294\n2016-11-02 01:00:00  10.693\n...\n2016-11-05 23:00:00  12.850\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 52. We must be careful: the date format is exactly as in the input: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n\n 53.
