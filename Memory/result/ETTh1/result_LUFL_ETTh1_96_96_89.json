        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2017-06-22 00:00:00 to 2017-06-25 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 to 2017-06-29 23:00:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a daily seasonality (24 hours) and also weekly patterns might be present (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not captured).\n 2. Given the short history, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality. Since the data is hourly, we can use a seasonal period of 24.\n 3. We must handle missing values, but the provided history does not have any missing values. However, the forecast should be robust to potential missingness in the future? \n    But note: the problem says the data will have missing values, but in the provided history we don't have any. So for forecasting, we are to produce 96-step forecast without gaps.\n\n 4. We can use a model like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality. However, with only 96 points, we must be cautious of overfitting.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Compute the average pattern for the 4 days we have and then use that to forecast the next 4 days? But that ignores any trend and might not capture variations.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, I will use a simple seasonal naive approach: \n    - The forecast for a particular hour in the next day is the same as the same hour in the previous day. But we have 4 days of history.\n\n 7. However, we can also use the average of the same hour over the 4 days to smooth out noise.\n\n 8. Let's break down the data by hour of the day and compute the mean for each hour across the 4 days.\n\n    Hour 0: (2.467 + 2.132 + 2.041 + 2.589) / 4 = (2.467+2.132+2.041+2.589)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725\n    ... and so on.\n\n 9. Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we will repeat this average pattern 4 times.\n\n 10. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. However, in the provided history we don't have any. \n     Since we are forecasting, we are to produce 96 values without any missing.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model. But with only 4 days, complex models might not be justified.\n\n 12. Let me check the data: \n      The data shows a clear daily pattern: \n        - Low during night (midnight to early morning)\n        - A peak in the morning (around 5-6 AM) and then again in the evening?\n\n 13. We can also consider a moving average or exponential smoothing for the seasonal pattern.\n\n 14. Given the simplicity and the requirement to provide 96-point forecast, I will use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days.\n\n 15. Steps for the forecast:\n      - Group the data by hour (0 to 23) and compute the mean for each hour.\n      - Then, for the next 4 days (from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 to 2017-06-29 23:00:00), we assign the mean value for that hour.\n\n 16. However, note that the last day in the history is 2017-06-25 (Sunday). The next 4 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? \n     But without knowing the day of the week effect, we cannot adjust for weekly seasonality. Since we only have 4 days (which are from Thursday to Sunday), \n     we don't have a full week. Therefore, we stick to the daily pattern.\n\n 17. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      Hour 0: [2.467, 2.132, 2.041, 2.589] -> mean = (2.467+2.132+2.041+2.589)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725\n      Hour 1: [2.284, 2.284, 2.254, 2.041] -> (2.284+2.284+2.254+2.041)/4 = 8.863/4 = 2.21575\n      Hour 2: [2.193, 2.254, 2.132, 2.132] -> (2.193+2.254+2.132+2.132)/4 = 8.711/4 = 2.17775\n      Hour 3: [2.102, 2.132, 2.163, 2.254] -> (2.102+2.132+2.163+2.254)/4 = 8.651/4 = 2.16275\n      Hour 4: [2.254, 2.254, 2.315, 2.528] -> (2.254+2.254+2.315+2.528)/4 = 9.351/4 = 2.33775\n      Hour 5: [3.320, 2.680, 2.863, 2.650] -> (3.320+2.680+2.863+2.650)/4 = 11.513/4 = 2.87825\n      Hour 6: [3.076, 3.107, 3.229, 3.076] -> (3.076+3.107+3.229+3.076)/4 = 12.488/4 = 3.122\n      Hour 7: [3.290, 2.680, 2.772, 3.107] -> (3.290+2.680+2.772+3.107)/4 = 11.849/4 = 2.96225\n      Hour 8: [3.229, 2.680, 3.076, 3.350] -> (3.229+2.680+3.076+3.350)/4 = 12.335/4 = 3.08375\n      Hour 9: [3.259, 2.467, 3.320, 3.015] -> (3.259+2.467+3.320+3.015)/4 = 12.061/4 = 3.01525\n      Hour 10: [3.868, 2.833, 3.594, 3.168] -> (3.868+2.833+3.594+3.168)/4 = 13.463/4 = 3.36575\n      Hour 11: [3.625, 3.046, 3.320, 3.655] -> (3.625+3.046+3.320+3.655)/4 = 13.646/4 = 3.4115\n      Hour 12: [2.924, 2.345, 3.107, 3.137] -> (2.924+2.345+3.107+3.137)/4 = 11.513/4 = 2.87825\n      Hour 13: [3.472, 2.619, 2.985, 2.985] -> (3.472+2.619+2.985+2.985)/4 = 12.061/4 = 3.01525\n      Hour 14: [3.015, 2.498, 2.863, 2.680] -> (3.015+2.498+2.863+2.680)/4 = 11.056/4 = 2.764\n      Hour 15: [2.528, 2.619, 3.107, 2.772] -> (2.528+2.619+3.107+2.772)/4 = 11.026/4 = 2.7565\n      Hour 16: [2.680, 2.619, 3.076, 2.711] -> (2.680+2.619+3.076+2.711)/4 = 11.086/4 = 2.7715\n      Hour 17: [3.229, 2.559, 3.411, 2.985] -> (3.229+2.559+3.411+2.985)/4 = 12.184/4 = 3.046\n      Hour 18: [2.833, 2.833, 3.381, 3.290] -> (2.833+2.833+3.381+3.290)/4 = 12.337/4 = 3.08425\n      Hour 19: [2.802, 2.559, 2.955, 2.985] -> (2.802+2.559+2.955+2.985)/4 = 11.301/4 = 2.82525\n      Hour 20: [2.924, 3.076, 3.807, 3.381] -> (2.924+3.076+3.807+3.381)/4 = 13.188/4 = 3.297\n      Hour 21: [2.802, 2.711, 3.381, 3.290] -> (2.802+2.711+3.381+3.290)/4 = 12.184/4 = 3.046\n      Hour 22: [2.528, 2.284, 3.076, 3.107] -> (2.528+2.284+3.076+3.107)/4 = 10.995/4 = 2.74875\n      Hour 23: [2.254, 2.010, 3.107, 2.772] -> (2.254+2.010+3.107+2.772)/4 = 10.143/4 = 2.53575\n\n 18. Now, we create the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-06-26 (Monday) - hours 0 to 23: use the hourly averages we computed above.\n      Day 2: 2017-06-27 (Tuesday) - same hourly averages.\n      Day 3: 2017-06-28 (Wednesday) - same.\n      Day 4: 2017-06-29 (Thursday) - same.\n\n 19. We generate the dates starting from 2017-06-26 00:00:00 and then every hour until 2017-06-29 23:00:00.\n\n 20. Format the answer as required.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values. But in the forecast we are generating, we are not missing any. \n We are providing 96 consecutive hours.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n 2017-06-26 00:00:00, 2.30725\n 2017-06-26 01:00:00, 2.21575\n ... until 2017-06-29 23:00:00\n\n But note: the original data has 3 decimal places. We can round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 21. Round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we might consider that the average might smooth too much and we lose the daily variation. \n     But with only 4 days, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 23. Let me recalc with rounding:\n\n      Hour 0: 2.307 -> 2.307\n      Hour 1: 2.216 -> 2.216\n      ... \n\n 24. However, note that the original data has 3 decimal places, but the averages might have more. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 25. We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use the exact fraction and then round. But the problem does not to omit any content, so we must provide the numbers.\n\n 27. Let me recalc and round:\n\n      Hour 0: (2.467+2.132+2.041+2.589)/4 = 9.229/4 = 2.30725 -> 2.307\n      Hour 1: (2.284+2.284+2.254+2.041)/4 = 8.863/4 = 2.21575 -> 2.216\n      Hour 2: (2.193+2.254+2.132+2.132)/4 = 8.711/4 = 2.17775 -> 2.178\n      Hour 3: (2.102+2.132+2.163+2.254)/4 = 8.651/4 = 2.16275 -> 2.163\n      Hour 4: (2.254+2.254+2.315+2.528)/4 = 9.351/4 = 2.33775 -> 2.338\n      Hour 5: (3.320+2.680+2.863+2.650)/4 = 11.513/4 = 2.87825 -> 2.878\n      Hour 6: (3.076+3.107+3.229+3.076)/4 = 12.488/4 = 3.122 -> 3.122\n      Hour 7: (3.290+2.680+2.772+3.107)/4 = 11.849/4 = 2.96225 -> 2.962\n      Hour 8: (3.229+2.680+3.076+3.350)/4 = 12.335/4 = 3.08375 -> 3.084\n      Hour 9: (3.259+2.467+3.320+3.015)/4 = 12.061/4 = 3.01525 -> 3.015\n      Hour 10: (3.868+2.833+3.594+3.168)/4 = 13.463/4 = 3.36575 -> 3.366\n      Hour 11: (3.625+3.046+3.320+3.655)/4 = 13.646/4 = 3.4115 -> 3.412\n      Hour 12: (2.924+2.345+3.107+3.137)/4 = 11.513/4 = 2.87825 -> 2.878\n      Hour 13: (3.472+2.619+2.985+2.985)/4 = 12.061/4 = 3.01525 -> 3.015\n      Hour 14: (3.015+2.498+2.863+2.680)/4 = 11.056/4 = 2.764 -> 2.764\n      Hour 15: (2.528+2.619+3.107+2.772)/4 = 11.026/4 = 2.7565 -> 2.757\n      Hour 16: (2.680+2.619+3.076+2.711)/4 = 11.086/4 = 2.7715 -> 2.772\n      Hour 17: (3.229+2.559+3.411+2.985)/4 = 12.184/4 = 3.046 -> 3.046\n      Hour 18: (2.833+2.833+3.381+3.290)/4 = 12.337/4 = 3.08425 -> 3.084\n      Hour 19: (2.802+2.559+2.955+2.985)/4 = 11.301/4 = 2.82525 -> 2.825\n      Hour 20: (2.924+3.076+3.807+3.381)/4 = 13.188/4 = 3.297 -> 3.297\n      Hour 21: (2.802+2.711+3.381+3.290)/4 = 12.184/4 = 3.046 -> 3.046\n      Hour 22: (2.528+2.284+3.076+3.107)/4 = 10.995/4 = 2.74875 -> 2.749\n      Hour 23: (2.254+2.010+3.107+2.772)/4 = 10.143/4 = 2.53575 -> 2.536\n\n 28. Now, we write the next 96 hours:\n\n      Start: 2017-06-26 00:00:00 -> hour0: 2.307\n            2017-06-26 01:00:00 -> hour1: 2.216\n            ... until 2017-06-26 23:00:00 -> hour23: 2.536\n\n      Then 2017-06-27 00:00:00 -> hour0: 2.307\n            ... and so on.\n\n 29. We generate 4 full cycles of the 24-hour pattern.\n\n 30. Write the answer in the required format.\n\n Note: The dates must be in the same format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n Let's code the dates:\n\n   Start: 2017-06-26 00:00:00\n   Then add 1 hour until 2017-06-26 23:00:00 -> 24 hours\n   Then 2017-06-27 00:00:00 ... until 2017-06-29 23:00:00.\n\n 31. We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n 32. The forecasted values for each hour of the day are:\n\n      hour0: 2.307\n      hour1: 2.216\n      hour2: 2.178\n      hour3: 2.163\n      hour4: 2.338\n      hour5: 2.878\n      hour6: 3.122\n      hour7: 2.962\n      hour8: 3.084\n      hour9: 3.015\n      hour10: 3.366\n      hour11: 3.412\n      hour12: 2.878\n      hour13: 3.015\n      hour14: 2.764\n      hour15: 2.757\n      hour16: 2.772\n      hour17: 3.046\n      hour18: 3.084\n      hour19: 2.825\n      hour20: 3.297\n      hour21: 3.046\n      hour22: 2.749\n      hour23: 2.536\n\n 33.
