        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-01-09 00:00:00 to 2017-01-12 23:00:00). We need to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are told to be aware of missing values. However, for forecasting, we have to assume the provided data is complete for the past 96 points? Since the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data seems complete. So we proceed with the given data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We note that the data is hourly.\n\n 3. We can use a time series model. Given the data shows some daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours) and also some non-stationarity, we can consider models like SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple seasonal naive.\n\n 4. However, note that the data has a few peculiarities: \n    - There are periods of constant values (e.g., 7.391 for several hours on 2017-01-09 evening).\n    - The values range from about 0.213 to 11.798.\n\n 5. Since we are required to provide the next 96 points, and we must not omit any content, we will generate 96 data points.\n\n 6. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a complete answer, we choose a method that can be implemented quickly and is robust: \n    - We will use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the seasonal component along with a trend. But note: we have only 4 days, so we have limited data.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the data has seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n 8. We can use a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? But note: the last day (2017-01-12) might not be the same as the previous days? \n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the 4 available days? But we have 4 days? Actually, we have 4 days (from 9th to 12th). So we can compute the average for each hour (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and then use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n    However, for the next 96 hours (4 days) we can repeat the same pattern? But note: the pattern might change? \n\n 10. But looking at the data, the pattern is not exactly the same every day. \n\n 11. We can use a model: \n     - We'll use an ARIMA model with seasonal components. We can use auto_arima to find the best parameters? But we are not run code, so we have to do it manually.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, we can do a simple approach: \n     - We note that the data has a daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a seasonal differencing and then an ARIMA model. \n\n 13. However, without running code, we have to rely on a simple method. \n\n 14. We can use the following: \n     - We take the last 4 days and compute the value for each hour as the average of that hour over the 4 days. Then we use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n     But note: the problem says there might be missing values? We don't see any in the provided data. \n\n 15. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We have 4 days: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th.\n\n     For hour 00:00: \n        9th: 10.305, 10th: 10.056, 11th: 10.625, 12th: 10.163 -> average = (10.305+10.056+10.625+10.163)/4 = 10.28725\n\n     Similarly for each hour.\n\n 16. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (from 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00) would be the same 24-hour pattern repeated 4 times.\n\n 17. But note: the data might have a trend? Let's check the overall level:\n\n        Day 9: average = (sum of 24 hours)/24\n        Day 10: ...\n        We don't see a clear trend in 4 days? \n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-01-12) as the pattern for the next day? But then we have to adjust for the level? \n\n 19. Given the simplicity and the fact that we must provide an answer, we choose the average method.\n\n 20. Steps for the average method:\n      - Group by hour of the day (i.e., 00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and compute the mean for that hour over the 4 days.\n\n 21. Then we create 4 copies of this 24-hour pattern.\n\n 22. The dates for the next 96 hours: \n        Start: 2017-01-13 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2017-01-12 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-01-13 01:00:00 ... until 2017-01-16 23:00:00.\n\n 23.

Now, we create the next 4 days by repeating this 24-hour pattern 4 times.\n\n 25. The dates: \n        Day 1: 2017-01-13 00:00:00 to 2017-01-13 23:00:00\n        Day 2: 2017-01-14 00:00:00 to 2017-01-14 23:00:00\n        Day 3: 2017-01-15 00:00:00 to 2017-01-15 23:00:00\n        Day 4: 2017-01-16 00:00:00 to 2017-01-16 23:00:00\n\n 26. We output the data in the same format: two columns (date and MUFL) with the date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\n\n 27. We round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 28. However, note: the input has some values with 3 decimal places, so we will output 3 decimal places.\n\n 29. But note: the average we computed might have more decimals, so we round to 3.\n\n 30. Let's create the data:\n\n     For 2017-01-13 00:00:00: 10.287 -> 10.287\n     But we must round? Let's do:\n\n        10.287 -> 10.287 (already 3 decimals? but it's 10.287, which is 3 decimal places? Actually, the input has 3 decimal places. So we keep 3.\n\n     However, we computed 10.28725 -> we round to 3 decimals: 10.287\n\n     Similarly, 9.2125 -> 9.213 (if we round to 3 decimals: 9.2125 -> 9.213)\n\n     We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Rounding:\n\n        Hour 00: 10.28725 -> 10.287\n        Hour 01: 9.2125 -> 9.213\n        Hour 02: 9.63025 -> 9.630\n        Hour 03: 9.54125 -> 9.541\n        Hour 04: 9.12375 -> 9.124\n        Hour 05: 8.83025 -> 8.830\n        Hour 06: 9.550 -> 9.550\n        Hour 07: 9.346 -> 9.346\n        Hour 08: 8.66175 -> 8.662\n        Hour 09: 7.48 -> 7.480   (because 7.48 is 7.480)\n        Hour 10: 6.73375 -> 6.734\n        Hour 11: 6.352 -> 6.352\n        Hour 12: 3.94425 -> 3.944\n        Hour 13: 3.891 -> 3.891\n        Hour 14: 5.0905 -> 5.091\n        Hour 15: 4.957 -> 4.957\n        Hour 16: 6.23625 -> 6.236\n        Hour 17: 7.3645 -> 7.365\n        Hour 18: 7.2845 -> 7.285\n        Hour 19: 7.48875 -> 7.489\n        Hour 20: 7.15125 -> 7.151\n        Hour 21: 6.7515 -> 6.752\n        Hour 22: 8.65275 -> 8.653\n        Hour 23: 9.4255 -> 9.426\n\n 32. Then we write the next 96 hours:\n\n        Day1: 2017-01-13 00:00:00 -> 10.287\n               2017-01-13 01:00:00 -> 9.213\n               ... until 23:00:00 -> 9.426\n\n        Day2: 2017-01-14 00:00:00 -> 10.287\n               2017-01-14 01:00:00 -> 9.213\n               ... \n\n        Day3: same pattern\n\n        Day4: same pattern\n\n 33. We output in the required format.\n\n 34. Note: The problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting without any missing values? We are providing a complete forecast.\n\n 35.
