        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of High UseFul Load (HUFL) from 2017-07-08 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HUFL.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset in general might.\n    However, the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we must handle any potential missing values in the input, but here we have.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We must choose a model. Given the time series nature and the relatively short history (96 points), we can use a model that can capture seasonality and trends.\n    The data shows a daily pattern (24 hours). We can use a seasonal model or a machine learning model. However, note that we are only given 4 days of history.\n\n 4. Given the small data size, we can use a simple model like Seasonal Naive, but that would just repeat the last season (day). Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or ARIMA/SARIMA.\n\n 5. However, note that the data has a daily seasonality (period=24). But with only 4 days, it's challenging to fit a complex model.\n\n 6. We can use a moving average or exponential smoothing to capture the trend and seasonality. But let's try to use a model that can handle seasonality.\n\n 7. Since we are to forecast 96 points and we have 96 points of history, we can use a model that uses the daily pattern. One simple idea is to take the average of the same hour across the 4 days and then adjust by the last day's trend? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a SARIMA model. But with only 4 days, the seasonal component might not be well estimated.\n\n 9. Given the constraints, we can use a simple approach: \n    - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual.\n    - Extrapolate the trend (if any) and then add the seasonal component.\n\n 10. However, note that the data does not show a clear trend over the 4 days. It fluctuates.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the last day (24 hours) and adjust by the average change from one day to the next? But we have only 4 days.\n\n 12. We can use a naive seasonal forecast: use the last day (2017-07-11) as the forecast for the next day? But that would be 2017-07-12. Then for the next 4 days, we can use the same pattern? But that would be repeating the last day 4 times? That might not be accurate.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can compute the average of each hour over the 4 days and then use that as the pattern for the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day.\n\n 14. Considering the data, we see that the pattern changes from day to day. We might need a model that can capture the daily cycle and the overall level.\n\n 15. We can use a linear regression with dummy variables for the hour of the day? But with only 4 days, we have 4 points per hour, which is very few.\n\n 16. Given the complexity and the small data, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days and then adjust by the overall level of the last day.\n\n    Let:\n        base = the last day (24 hours) of data: from 2017-07-11 00:00:00 to 2017-07-11 23:00:00.\n        average_hourly = the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 4 days.\n\n    Then we can set the forecast for the next day (2017-07-12) as:\n        forecast_hour_i = average_hourly[i] + (last_day_hour_i - average_hourly[i]) * (some weight) \n    But without a clear trend, we might just use the average_hourly pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 17. However, note that the level of the time series might be changing. We can adjust by the last day's average level.\n\n    Let:\n        last_day_avg = average of the last day (2017-07-11)\n        overall_avg = average of all 96 points\n        base_pattern = average_hourly (the 24 hourly averages)\n\n    Then we can adjust the base pattern by the difference between the last day's average and the overall average:\n\n        adjusted_pattern = base_pattern + (last_day_avg - overall_avg)\n\n    Then for the next 4 days, we repeat the adjusted_pattern 4 times.\n\n 18. But note: the overall_avg is the average of 4 days, and the last_day_avg is one of them. This might not capture the trend.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days to adjust? \n\n 20. Given the time and simplicity, we'll use the following:\n\n    Step 1: Compute the 24-hour average pattern (over the 4 days).\n    Step 2: Compute the average of the entire 96 points -> overall_avg.\n    Step 3: Compute the average of the last day (24 points) -> last_day_avg.\n    Step 4: The adjustment factor = last_day_avg - overall_avg.\n    Step 5: The base pattern for the next 4 days is the 24-hour average pattern plus the adjustment factor? \n            But that would shift the entire pattern. Alternatively, we can scale the pattern? \n\n    However, note: the pattern might be relative changes. We can do an additive adjustment.\n\n    So: forecast for hour i in the next (for any of the next 4 days) = base_pattern[i] + (last_day_avg - overall_avg)\n\n 21. But let's test: \n        base_pattern is the average for that hour. We are shifting the entire pattern by a constant (last_day_avg - overall_avg). \n        This constant is the deviation of the last day from the overall average.\n\n 22. However, we have 4 days and the last day might be above or below the overall average. This method would shift the pattern accordingly.\n\n 23. Let's compute:\n\n        overall_avg = mean of the 96 points\n        last_day_avg = mean of the last 24 points.\n\n        Then for each hour i (0 to 23) in the next 4 days, the forecast is:\n            base_pattern[i] + (last_day_avg - overall_avg)\n\n 24. But note: the base_pattern is already the average for that hour. We are adjusting the entire day by the same amount.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the last day as the base and then adjust by the average pattern? \n\n 26. Another idea: use the average pattern for the next 4 days without adjustment? \n\n 27. We must also consider that the data might have a trend. We don't have enough points to model a trend, so we ignore.\n\n 28. We'll go with the adjusted average pattern.\n\n 29. Steps:\n\n        Step 1: Create a list of the 96 values.\n        Step 2: Reshape into 4 rows (days) and 24 columns (hours).\n        Step 3: Compute the average for each hour (across the 4 days) -> base_pattern (24 values).\n        Step 4: overall_avg = average of all 96 values.\n        Step 5: last_day = the 24 values of the last day (2017-07-11)\n        Step 6: last_day_avg = average(last_day)\n\n        Step 7: adjustment = last_day_avg - overall_avg\n\n        Step 8: Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n                For day 1 (2017-07-12): [base_pattern[0] + adjustment, base_pattern[1] + adjustment, ... , base_pattern[23] + adjustment]\n                For day 2 (2017-07-13): same as day 1? \n                But wait, we are repeating the same pattern for each day? \n\n        However, note: the base_pattern is the average pattern for each hour. We are going to use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days, but shifted by the adjustment.\n\n 30. But the adjustment is constant for all hours. So each day in the forecast will have the same pattern.\n\n 31. Alternatively, we can adjust each day by a different amount? But we don't have information to do that.\n\n 32. We'll generate 4 copies of the adjusted base pattern.\n\n 33. Now, we must generate the dates. The last given date is 2017-07-11 23:00:00. The next 96 hours:\n\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00\n        ...\n        2017-07-15 23:00:00\n\n 34. Let's compute the values:\n\n        Given data: 96 points from 2017-07-08 to 2017-07-11 (4 days)\n\n        We'll compute:\n\n            base_pattern = [ average for hour0, hour1, ... hour23 ]\n\n        Then:\n\n            forecast_pattern = [x + adjustment for x in base_pattern]\n\n        Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is: 4 repetitions of forecast_pattern.\n\n 35. Let's calculate:\n\n        First, the overall_avg:\n\n            We have 96 points. We can compute the average.\n\n        The data:\n\n            Day1: 2017-07-08: [13.865, 14.937, 14.200, 13.329, 13.798, 12.592, 12.190, 11.387, 6.698, -1.139, 3.014, 2.478, -10.181, 0.268, 1.674, 4.287, 2.813, 6.899, 6.765, 8.908, 11.387, 10.650, 10.985, 11.454]\n            Day2: 2017-07-09: [13.597, 12.726, 12.458, 10.918, 11.119, 12.458, 11.320, 9.645, 7.703, 4.957, 3.483, 4.354, -1.474, 1.942, 1.808, 2.813, 4.488, 6.028, 6.631, 6.899, 7.904, 7.770, 9.779, 9.243]\n            Day3: 2017-07-10: [10.851, 11.922, 11.588, 10.717, 9.377, 9.310, 8.105, 8.038, 7.167, 5.827, 6.564, 3.684, -2.344, -10.650, -0.469, -5.358, 1.139, 3.751, 5.626, 7.100, 9.042, 10.784, 9.310, 11.320]\n            Day4: 2017-07-11: [10.181, 10.047, 9.913, 9.042, 10.516, 9.578, 9.913, 6.028, 0.268, -6.229, -9.243, -11.521, -13.597, -12.257, -10.449, -7.569, -3.684, 2.076, 7.234, 8.975, 11.855, 11.454, 11.052, 10.650]\n\n        Let's compute the overall average:\n\n            We can do: sum(all values) / 96.\n\n        We'll do it step by step in code? But we are not coding, so we have to calculate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the average per day and then average the daily averages?

So the forecast for each hour i is: base_pattern[i] - 3.2344\n\n        hour0: 12.1235 - 3.2344 = 8.8891\n        hour1: 12.408 - 3.2344 = 9.1736\n        ... and so on.\n\n 41. Then we repeat this pattern 4 times for the next 4 days.\n\n 42. We must generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-07-12 00:00:00 (next after 2017-07-11 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-07-12 01:00:00 ... until 2017-07-15 23:00:00.\n\n 43. We'll write the forecast in the same format.\n\n 44. However, note: the method is very simplistic. But given the constraints, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 45. Let's write the first day of forecast:\n\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00  8.8891\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00  9.1736\n        2017-07-12 02:00:00  8.80535\n        2017-07-12 03:00:00  7.7671\n        2017-07-12 04:00:00  7.9681\n        2017-07-12 05:00:00  7.7501\n        2017-07-12 06:00:00  7.1476\n        2017-07-12 07:00:00  5.5401\n        2017-07-12 08:00:00  2.2246\n        2017-07-12 09:00:00 -2.3804\n        2017-07-12 10:00:00 -2.2799\n        2017-07-12 11:00:00 -3.23565\n        2017-07-12 12:00:00 -10.1334\n        2017-07-12 13:00:00 -8.40865\n        2017-07-12 14:00:00 -5.0934\n        2017-07-12 15:00:00 -4.69115\n        2017-07-12 16:00:00 -2.0454\n        2017-07-12 17:00:00  1.4541\n        2017-07-12 18:00:00  3.3296\n        2017-07-12 19:00:00  4.7361\n        2017-07-12 20:00:00  6.8126\n        2017-07-12 21:00:00  6.9301\n        2017-07-12 22:00:00  7.0471\n        2017-07-12 23:00:00  7.43235\n\n 46. Then the next three days are the same pattern? \n\n        Day2: 2017-07-13 00:00:00  8.8891\n        ... and so on.\n\n 47. But note: the pattern is the same for each day? Yes, because we are using the average pattern and then shifting by a constant.\n\n 48. However, we must note that the adjustment was computed from the last day and the overall average. We are not changing the pattern per day.\n\n 49. We'll generate 4 days of the same 24 values (the adjusted base pattern).\n\n 50. We must format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n\n2017-07-12 00:00:00  8.8891\n2017-07-12 01:00:00  9.1736\n... (all 96 lines)\n\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 51. We'll round to 3 decimal places? The input had 3 decimals. But our calculation has 4. We'll round to 3.\n\n 52. Let's recompute the base_pattern with 3 decimals? Actually, we computed with more and then subtract the adjustment. We'll round the final result to 3 decimals.\n\n 53. Alternatively, we can use the exact values and then round.\n\n 54. We'll do:\n\n        base_pattern = [12.1235, 12.408, 12.03975, 11.0015, 11.2025, 10.9845, 10.382, 8.7745, 5.459, 0.854, 0.9545, -0.00125, -6.899, -5.17425, -1.859, -1.45675, 1.189, 4.6885, 6.564, 7.9705, 10.047, 10.1645, 10.2815, 10.66675]\n\n        adjustment = -3.2344\n\n        Then each value = base_pattern[i] + adjustment, then round to 3 decimals.\n\n 55. We'll do the rounding at the end.\n\n 56. Let's compute the first few:\n\n        hour0: 12.1235 - 3.2344 = 8.8891 -> 8.889\n        hour1: 12.408 - 3.2344 = 9.1736 -> 9.174\n        hour2: 12.03975 - 3.2344 = 8.80535 -> 8.805\n        hour3: 11.0015 - 3.2344 = 7.7671 -> 7.767\n        hour4: 11.2025 - 3.2344 = 7.9681 -> 7.968\n        hour5: 10.9845 - 3.2344 = 7.7501 -> 7.750\n        hour6: 10.382 - 3.2344 = 7.1476 -> 7.148\n        hour7: 8.7745 - 3.2344 = 5.5401 -> 5.540\n        hour8: 5.459 - 3.2344 = 2.2246 -> 2.225\n        hour9: 0.854 - 3.2344 = -2.3804 -> -2.380\n        hour10: 0.9545 - 3.2344 = -2.2799 -> -2.280\n        hour11: -0.00125 - 3.2344 = -3.23565 -> -3.236\n        hour12: -6.899 - 3.2344 = -10.1334 -> -10.133\n        hour13: -5.17425 - 3.2344 = -8.40865 -> -8.409\n        hour14: -1.859 - 3.2344 = -5.0934 -> -5.093\n        hour15: -1.45675 - 3.2344 = -4.69115 -> -4.691\n        hour16: 1.189 - 3.2344 = -2.0454 -> -2.045\n        hour17: 4.6885 - 3.2344 = 1.4541 -> 1.454\n        hour18: 6.564 - 3.2344 = 3.3296 -> 3.330\n        hour19: 7.9705 - 3.2344 = 4.7361 -> 4.736\n        hour20: 10.047 - 3.2344 = 6.8126 -> 6.813\n        hour21: 10.1645 - 3.2344 = 6.9301 -> 6.930\n        hour22: 10.2815 - 3.2344 = 7.0471 -> 7.047\n        hour23: 10.66675 - 3.2344 = 7.43235 -> 7.432\n\n 57. Then the first day (2017-07-12) is:\n\n        2017-07-12 00:00:00  8.889\n        2017-07-12 01:00:00  9.174\n        2017-07-12 02:00:00  8.805\n        2017-07-12 03:00:00  7.767\n        2017-07-12 04:00:00  7.968\n        2017-07-12 05:00:00  7.750\n        2017-07-12 06:00:00  7.148\n        2017-07-12 07:00:00  5.540\n        2017-07-12 08:00:00  2.225\n        2017-07-12 09:00:00 -2.380\n        2017-07-12 10:00:00 -2.280\n        2017-07-12 11:00:00 -3.236\n        2017-07-12 12:00:00 -10.133\n        2017-07-12 13:00:00 -8.409\n        2017-07-12 14:00:00 -5.093\n        2017-07-12 15:00:00 -4.691\n        2017-07-12 16:00:00 -2.045\n        2017-07-12 17:00:00  1.454\n        2017-07-12 18:00:00  3.330\n        2017-07-12 19:00:00  4.736\n        2017-07-12 20:00:00  6.813\n        2017-07-12 21:00:00  6.930\n        2017-07-12 22:00:00  7.047\n        2017-07-12 23:00:00  7.432\n\n 58. Then the next three days are the same 24 numbers.\n\n 59. We'll write the next 96 lines accordingly.\n\n 60. But note: the pattern is the same for each day? Yes.\n\n 61. We'll generate:\n\n        Day1: 2017-07-12\n        Day2: 2017-07-13\n        Day3: 2017-07-14\n        Day4: 2017-07-15\n\n 62. We must be careful: the dates must be consecutive.\n\n 63. We'll write the data in the next 96 hours.\n\n 64. Code for generating the dates:\n\n        start_date = 2017-07-12 00:00:00\n        then add 1 hour until 96 records.\n\n 65. We'll write the answer.\n\n 66. However, note: the method is very simple and may not capture the dynamics. But with only 4 days of history, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n 67.
