        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly records of oil temperature (OT) from 2017-08-05 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of OT data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing value warning, but the provided 96 points seem complete? However, we must be cautious.\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting 4 days.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a time series model that can handle multiple seasonality. The data might have daily and weekly patterns.\n - Given the small data size (only 96 points, which is 4 days) and we are to forecast 96 points (another 4 days), we have limited history.\n - We might consider models like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet. However, with only 4 days of history, capturing weekly patterns is not possible.\n - Alternatively, we can use a simple model that captures daily seasonality. The data shows a clear daily cycle (temperature rising during the day and falling at night).\n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can try to average the daily pattern and then project it forward, but note that the last day (2017-08-08) has some anomalies (like a drop to 17.445999 and then even lower to 14.843, which might be due to missing data or an event). However, the problem says there are missing values, but the provided data does not have explicit NaNs in the given points.\n\n How to handle:\n - We are not told to impute the given data, so we assume the provided 96 points are as is.\n - For forecasting, we can use a model that is robust to such anomalies? Or we can try to capture the typical daily pattern.\n\n Given the constraints, one simple approach:\n  1. Decompose the time series into trend and seasonality. But with only 4 days, the trend might be hard to capture.\n  2. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-08) as a base and adjust? But that day seems to have a drop.\n\n Another idea: use the data from the first three days to compute a typical daily profile and then adjust by the trend of the last day? However, the problem does not specify the cause of the drop on 2017-08-08.\n\n Since we are not given any external variables (like load) and only OT, we must rely on the history.\n\n Considering the above, we can use a seasonal naive method: \n   - The pattern of the next day is similar to the same hour of the previous day. But the last day (2017-08-08) is very different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the previous days for the same hour.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days we have? But note: 4 days is very short and the last day is an outlier.\n\n However, the problem says the data has missing values. We are not told which ones are missing, but in the provided data we have 96 points without explicit gaps? \n\n Since the task is to forecast the next 96 points, and we must provide the complete data, we will generate 96 values.\n\n We choose a method: \n   We will use a simple average of the same hour from the previous 4 days. But note that the last day (2017-08-08) has a drop, which might be a new pattern? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-08-08) as the pattern for the next day? But the problem says the data has missing values, so maybe the drop is due to missing data? \n\n   However, without more information, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the first three days (which are more consistent) and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n   But note: the last day (2017-08-08) has a drop that starts at 2017-08-07 23:00:00 (17.445999) and then continues low. It might be a data issue or a real event.\n\n   Since we are to forecast, we have to decide: \n      Option 1: Assume the drop is temporary and the pattern will return to normal? \n      Option 2: Assume the drop is a new level?\n\n   Without domain knowledge, we can try to model the daily pattern and then use the last day's level as a base? \n\n   We can do:\n      Let H_i be the hour of the day (0 to 23).\n      For each hour h, we compute the average of the first three days for that hour: avg_h.\n      Then, for the last day (2017-08-08) we have values for each hour: last_h.\n      We can compute the difference (or ratio) between the last day and the typical day? \n\n   But note: the last day is very different. Alternatively, we can use the last day as the pattern for the next day? \n\n   However, the problem says the data has missing values. It is possible that the last day has missing values? But the provided data for the last day has 24 points? \n\n   We are not told which values are missing, so we assume the provided 96 points are complete? \n\n   Therefore, we will forecast by repeating the pattern of the last day (2017-08-08) for the next 4 days? \n\n   But wait, the last day (2017-08-08) has a drop. If we repeat that pattern for the next 4 days, we are assuming that the drop continues. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days? \n\n   Considering the ambiguity, we choose to use a moving average of the last 24 hours to forecast the next 24 hours, and then repeat for 4 days? \n\n   However, the pattern might change. \n\n   Another idea: use an exponential smoothing model with daily seasonality. But we only have 4 days, so we set the seasonality period to 24.\n\n   We can use the `statsmodels` library to fit an ExponentialSmoothing model. However, we are not running code, so we have to simulate.\n\n   Given the constraints of this exercise, we will generate the forecast by:\n\n     1. Taking the last 24 hours (2017-08-08 00:00:00 to 2017-08-08 23:00:00) as the base pattern.\n     2. Then, we adjust this base pattern by the trend observed in the last 4 days? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire 4 days for each hour? \n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour of the day over the 4 days:\n\n        hour0: [19.416, 19.486, 20.893, 14.843] -> average = (19.416+19.486+20.893+14.843)/4 = 18.6595\n        hour1: [19.486, 19.063, 20.962, 18.219] -> (19.486+19.063+20.962+18.219)/4 = 19.4325\n\n   But note: the last day is very different. This average would be pulled down by the last day.\n\n   We could use the median? \n\n        hour0: [14.843, 19.416, 19.486, 20.893] -> sorted: [14.843, 19.416, 19.486, 20.893] -> median = (19.416+19.486)/2 = 19.451\n\n   This ignores the last day's drop? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the first three days to compute the typical pattern and then adjust by the overall level of the last day? \n\n   Step 1: Compute the typical daily profile from the first three days (72 hours) by averaging each hour (0-23) over the three days.\n\n        For hour0: (19.416 + 19.486 + 20.893) / 3 = 19.931666...\n        For hour1: (19.486 + 19.063 + 20.962) / 3 = 19.837\n\n   Step 2: Compute the average of the last day (2017-08-08) for all 24 hours: \n        Let S = (14.843 + 18.219 + ... + 15.054) / 24.\n\n   We calculate S: \n        14.843+18.219+18.009+17.445+18.009+17.726+17.305+17.024+16.320+11.959+12.944+11.537+14.703+12.381+15.758+14.069+10.833+10.763+13.014+15.195+14.491+12.874+14.843+15.054\n\n        We can compute step by step:\n\n        Let me add: \n          14.843 + 18.219 = 33.062\n          +18.009 = 51.071\n          +17.445 = 68.516\n          +18.009 = 86.525\n          +17.726 = 104.251\n          +17.305 = 121.556\n          +17.024 = 138.58\n          +16.320 = 154.9\n          +11.959 = 166.859\n          +12.944 = 179.803\n          +11.537 = 191.34\n          +14.703 = 206.043\n          +12.381 = 218.424\n          +15.758 = 234.182\n          +14.069 = 248.251\n          +10.833 = 259.084\n          +10.763 = 269.847\n          +13.014 = 282.861\n          +15.195 = 298.056\n          +14.491 = 312.547\n          +12.874 = 325.421\n          +14.843 = 340.264\n          +15.054 = 355.318\n\n        S = 355.318 / 24 = 14.8049166667\n\n   Step 3: Compute the average of the typical daily profile (from first three days) for the same 24 hours? Actually, we have the typical profile for each hour, but we need the overall average of the typical day? \n\n        Let T = average of the 24 typical hourly values (from the first three days).\n\n        We have to compute the typical value for each hour and then average them? \n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the average of the first three days: \n            Total of first 72 hours: \n            We can sum the first 72 numbers? But we don't have the full list, so we can use the typical profile: \n            T = (sum of the typical hourly values) / 24? Actually, the typical profile is already an average per hour, so the average of the typical day is the average of the 24 typical values.\n\n        But note: the typical profile is computed by averaging the same hour over three days. The average of the entire typical day would be the same as the average of the first three days? \n\n        Let M = average of the first three days (72 points). We can compute:\n\n        We don't have the full 72 points, but we can calculate:\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid by: \n            The typical daily profile is [A0, A1, ... A23] for the 24 hours.\n            Then the average T = (A0+A1+...+A23)/24.\n\n        We don't compute without the data? \n\n   Instead, we can do:\n\n        We want to adjust the typical profile by the level of the last day. We can shift the typical profile by the difference in level between the last day and the typical day? \n\n        Let shift = S - T   (where T is the average of the typical day)\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h on the next day = A_h + shift.\n\n        But we don't have T? \n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the average of the first three days (M) and then the shift = S - M.\n\n        Then the forecast for the next day: for hour h, we use: A_h + (S - M)\n\n        But note: A_h is the typical value for hour h, and M is the average of the first three days.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h = A_h + (S - M)\n\n   How to compute M (average of first three days)? \n\n        We have the first 72 hours. We can sum them? We don't have the full list, but we can approximate by:\n\n        We have the data, but in the problem we are only given 96 points. We are to use the provided 96 points to forecast the next 96.\n\n        However, we are not going to compute manually 72 numbers. \n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are not running code, we choose a simpler method:\n\n        We will use the last day (2017-08-08) as the pattern for the next day, and then for the following days we repeat the same pattern? \n\n        But the last day is very low. Then the next day would be the same as 2017-08-08? \n\n        Then the next 96 hours would be 4 repetitions of the last day? \n\n        However, that would be:\n\n          2017-08-09 00:00:00: 14.843\n          2017-08-09 01:00:00: 18.219\n          ... until 2017-08-09 23:00:00: 15.054\n\n          then 2017-08-10 00:00:00: 14.843 again? \n\n        But the problem says the data has missing values. We are not sure if the last day is complete. \n\n        However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates.\n\n   Considering the above, and the fact that we have limited data, we decide to use:\n\n        Forecast = the last 24 hours repeated 4 times.\n\n   Why? \n        - It is simple and captures the most recent pattern.\n        - The last day might represent a new regime (like a cooling event) and we are to continue that.\n\n   But note: the last day starts at 2017-08-08 00:00:00 and ends at 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n\n   The next 96 hours would be from 2017-08-09 00:00:00 to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n\n   We will generate:\n\n        2017-08-09 00:00:00: same as 2017-08-08 00:00:00 -> 14.843\n        2017-08-09 01:00:00: same as 2017-08-08 01:00:00 -> 18.219\n        ... until 2017-08-09 23:00:00: 15.054\n\n        then 2017-08-10 00:00:00: 14.843 again, and so on.\n\n   However, we must generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   Steps to generate the dates:\n\n        The last date in the given data is 2017-08-08 23:00:00.\n        The next date is 2017-08-09 00:00:00, then 2017-08-09 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-08-12 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 96 points.\n\n   We will create a list of dates:\n\n        start = 2017-08-09 00:00:00\n        end   = 2017-08-12 23:00:00\n\n        with frequency hourly.\n\n   And the values: \n        [14.843, 18.219, 18.009, 17.445, 15.054] for the first day, then repeat the same sequence for the next three days.\n\n   But note: the last day provided (2017-08-08) has 24 values. We will use that list in order and repeat it 4 times.\n\n   The list for 2017-08-08:\n\n        OT = [14.843, 18.219, 18.009, 17.445, 18.009, 17.726, 17.305, 17.024, 16.320, 11.959, 12.944, 11.537, 14.703, 12.381, 15.758, 14.069, 10.833, 10.763, 13.014, 15.195, 14.491, 12.874, 14.843, 15.054]\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is:\n\n        Day1 (2017-08-09): [14.843, 15.054]\n\n   But wait, the last day (2017-08-08) has 24 hours, so we take the entire list and repeat 4 times.\n\n   Therefore, the forecasted values for the next 96 hours will be:\n\n        [14.843, 15.054] repeated 4 times?

But without more data, we use the most recent complete cycle.\n\n   We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns (date and OT) with the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and the OT as float with 6 decimal places? The input had 6 decimal places, but we note that the numbers are given with 6 decimal places, but they are actually 3 decimal places? \n\n   We output with 6 decimal places by appending zeros if needed.\n\n   But the numbers we are repeating are exactly as in the last day.\n\n   We use the same representation: 14.843000, etc.\n\n   We write 96 lines.\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not imputing the forecast? We are generating the forecast. We assume the provided 96 points are complete? \n\n   We follow the instructions.\n\n   We output the forecast for the next 96 hours.\n\n   This is a simple and practical approach given the constraints.\n",
