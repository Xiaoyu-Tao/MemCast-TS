        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"HUFL\" (High Useful Load) from 2017-10-08 00:00:00 to 2017-10-11 23:00:00 (which is 4 days * 24 hours = 96 records).\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) starting from 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n\n However, note the following:\n - The data has missing values? The provided data does not show explicit missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the dataset may have missing values.\n - We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, meaning we must output 96 forecasted values.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast 96 points and the data is hourly, we can use a time series model that can handle multiple steps ahead.\n\n Given the constraints and the fact that we are in a text-based environment, we cannot run complex models. However, we can use a simple method to generate a baseline forecast.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values in the provided data and impute if necessary. But in the given data, there are 96 consecutive records without any gap? \n    Looking at the dates, they are consecutive and complete for 4 days. So we can proceed.\n\n 2. We note that the data has a daily pattern (diurnal variation). For example, the values drop during the day (around 9:00 to 16:00) and rise at night.\n\n 3. We can use a simple method: \n    a. Decompose the series into trend, seasonality, and residual. But without a long history, we can use a naive seasonal method.\n    b. Since we have 4 days, we can compute the average daily pattern and then adjust by the last known value.\n\n 4. However, a more robust method is to use the last day (or last few days) to project forward. Since the pattern repeats daily, we can use the pattern from the last day (2017-10-11) and replicate it for the next 4 days? \n    But note: the pattern might change slightly. We can also take the average of the four days for each hour.\n\n 5. Let's compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) over the 4 days we have.\n\n    Steps for averaging:\n      - Group by hour (i.e., the time of day: 0,1,...,23)\n      - Compute the mean for each hour.\n\n 6. Then, for the next 96 hours (4 days), we will use the computed average for each hour. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have a long history to compute a trend.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-10-11) as the pattern for the next day? But the problem says the data has missing values? We don't see any in the provided data.\n\n 8. Since we are to provide a forecast and we don't have a long history, we will use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n 9. How to handle the starting point? The next day starts at 2017-10-12 00:00:00.\n\n 10. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n      hour0: (12.123 + 11.052 + 10.717 + 10.717) / 4\n      hour1: (11.588 + 11.186 + 11.855 + 10.650) / 4\n      ... and so on.\n\n 11. Then we replicate this pattern for 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 12. But note: the data might have a trend? We don't have enough data to model a long-term trend. So we assume stationarity in the daily pattern.\n\n 13. However, if we look at the data, the values on 2017-10-11 are generally lower than the first day? We might need to adjust for a level shift? \n     But without more context, we stick to the average.\n\n 14. Steps to generate the forecast:\n\n      a. Extract the hour from the timestamp.\n      b. Group by hour and compute the mean.\n      c. For the next 96 hours (from 2017-10-12 00:00:00 to 2017-10-15 23:00:00), assign the average value corresponding to the hour.\n\n 15. But note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are only given 96 complete points? So we don't need to impute in the training data.\n\n 16. However, if we are to be cautious, we can check for missing values in the provided data. The provided data has 96 rows without any gap. So we are safe.\n\n 17. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We'll create a list of 24 averages, one for each hour.\n\n 18. Then, we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n      Day 1: 2017-10-12 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> average_hour0\n              2017-10-12 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> average_hour1\n              ...\n              up to 2017-10-12 23:00:00 -> hour23 -> average_hour23\n\n      Then repeat for the next 3 days.\n\n 19. We must output the dates and the forecasted HUFL.\n\n 20. Format the output as per the requirement.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse the given data (we are given as a string, but we can extract the values and the dates for the next 96 hours)\n\n   Step 2: Compute the hourly averages from the 4 days.\n\n   Step 3: Generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-10-12 00:00:00, then 2017-10-12 01:00:00, ... until 2017-10-15 23:00:00.\n\n   Step 4: For each timestamp, determine the hour and assign the corresponding average.\n\n   Step 5: Format the output.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values. We are not given any in the training set, so we proceed.\n\n But what if the pattern is not exactly the same? We are using a simple average. This is a baseline.\n\n Since we are not given a method to handle complex models, we use this.\n\n Let's compute the hourly means:\n\n   We'll create an array for each hour (0-23) and collect the values for that hour from the 4 days.\n\n   Example for hour0 (00:00:00):\n        Day1: 12.123\n        Day2: 11.052\n        Day3: 10.717\n        Day4: 10.717\n        average = (12.123 + 11.052 + 10.717 + 10.717) / 4 = 44.609 / 4 = 11.15225\n\n   Similarly for hour1 (01:00:00):\n        Day1: 11.588\n        Day2: 11.186\n        Day3: 11.855\n        Day4: 10.650\n        average = (11.588 + 11.186 + 11.855 + 10.650) / 4 = 45.279 / 4 = 11.31975\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. Then we generate the next 96 hours:\n\n        date = 2017-10-12 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 11.15225\n        date = 2017-10-12 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 11.31975\n        ... and so on.\n\n 22. We round to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 23. Write the output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the input data has 3 decimal places, but the forecasted values are averages and might have more. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n 24. We must output 96 lines.\n\n Let's code this in our mind:\n\n   We have the 96 records. We can split by day? Actually, we can group by the hour of the day.\n\n   We'll create a list of lists: 24 buckets.\n\n   Then, for each row in the 96 rows:\n\n        hour = int(date.split()[1].split(':')[0])   # but the date is given as string, e.g., \"2017-10-08 00:00:00\"\n\n   Alternatively, we note that the data is in order: first 24 are day1, next 24 day2, etc.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        hour_index = i % 24   for the i-th record (0-indexed)\n\n   Then:\n\n        bucket[hour_index].append(value)\n\n   Then for each bucket, compute the mean.\n\n 25. Then for the next 96 hours:\n\n        for day in range(4):   # 4 days\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date = start_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n\n        The start_date is 2017-10-12 00:00:00.\n\n 26. How to generate the dates:\n\n        from datetime import datetime, timedelta   (but note: we are not actually coding, but we can simulate)\n\n        base = datetime(2017, 10, 12, 0, 0, 0)\n\n        Then for i in range(96):\n            current = base + timedelta(hours=i)\n            hour_of_day = current.hour   # which is i % 24\n\n        Then the value = average[hour_of_day]\n\n 27. We must output the date in the same string format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 28. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        We'll create an array `hourly_avg` of 24 zeros, and an array `count` of 24 zeros? Actually, we can use a list of lists.\n\n        But since we have exactly 4 values for each hour, we can just sum and divide by 4.\n\n 29. We'll do:\n\n        hourly_sums = [0.0] * 24\n        for i in range(96):\n            hour_index = i % 24\n            hourly_sums[hour_index] += HUFL_value[i]\n\n        hourly_avg = [total / 4 for total in hourly_sums]\n\n 30. Then round each to 3 decimal places.\n\n 31. Then generate the next 96 records.\n\n 32. Format the output.\n\n But note: the input data has 3 decimal places, but the average might have more. We round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Example: 11.15225 -> 11.152\n\n However, note that the input data sometimes has 3 decimal places, but sometimes 6? Actually, the input is given with 3 decimal places.\n\n 33. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We are given the data as:\n\n        \"2017-10-08 00:00:00  12.123000\"\n\n   So we have 6 decimal places? But the value is 12.123. We can output with 3 decimal places.\n\n   We'll format the number as: \"{:.3f}\".format(value)\n\n 34. Now, let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We'll extract the HUFL values into a list.\n\n   Given data:\n\n        [12.123, 11.588, 11.119, 12.659, 10.985, 10.717, 14.87, 11.32, 3.952, -6.899, -11.655, -13.597, -16.678, -15.874, -12.123, -7.569, -2.143, 5.291, 6.43, 7.904, 6.966, 8.372, 10.382, 10.382,   # day1\n         11.052, 11.186, 10.985, 10.985, 11.052, 9.377, 12.257, 9.913, 3.215, -7.837, -12.257, -14.803, -17.683, -15.673, -12.994, -7.77, -2.813, 4.823, 8.105, 8.573, 8.038, 7.502, 9.98, 11.721,   # day2\n         10.717, 11.855, 11.788, 11.454, 12.726, 11.119, 12.927, 10.65, 7.167, 3.081, -1.942, -9.846, -4.823, -0.402, 2.679, 1.206, 4.89, 6.966, 7.837, 7.502, 6.564, 6.162, 8.975, 10.851,   # day3\n         10.717, 10.65, 9.913, 10.047, 9.779, 9.846, 9.913, 10.315, 9.109, 6.564, 6.832, 5.961, 4.555, 4.153, 5.492, 5.626, 6.698, 6.966, 6.497, 6.095, 5.224, 4.555, 5.157, 8.172]   # day4\n\n 35. Now, we compute the hourly sums:\n\n        hour0: 12.123 + 11.052 + 10.717 + 10.717 = 44.609 -> 11.15225 -> 11.152\n        hour1: 11.588 + 11.186 + 11.855 + 10.65 = 45.279 -> 11.31975 -> 11.320\n        hour2: 11.119 + 10.985 + 11.788 + 9.913 = 43.805 -> 10.95125 -> 10.951\n        ... and so on.\n\n 36. We'll compute all 24.\n\n 37. Then we generate the next 96 records:\n\n        Start date: 2017-10-12 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 11.152\n        Then 2017-10-12 01:00:00 -> hour1 -> 11.320\n        ... until 2017-10-12 23:00:00 -> hour23 -> (we compute the average for hour23 from the data)\n\n        Then 2017-10-13 00:00:00 -> hour0 -> 11.152 again.\n\n 38. We do this for 4 days.\n\n 39. Write the output.\n\n 40. We must output in the exact format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-10-12 00:00:00  11.152\n2017-10-12 01:00:00  11.320\n...\n2017-10-15 23:00:00  [the last value for hour23]\n```\n\n        </answer>\n\n 41. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We'll do it step by step for all 24 hours.\n\n        We'll create a list `values` of 24 lists.\n\n        Instead, we can do:\n\n            hourly_avgs = []\n            for hour in range(24):\n                total = 0\n                for day in range(4):\n                    index = day * 24 + hour\n                    total += data[index]\n                avg = total / 4\n                hourly_avgs.append(round(avg, 3))\n\n 42. Then we generate the next 96:\n\n        base_date = \"2017-10-12 00:00:00\"\n        We can generate the dates by:\n\n            from datetime import datetime, timedelta   (in our mind)\n\n            base = datetime(2017, 10, 12, 0, 0, 0)\n            for i in range(96):\n                date_str = (base + timedelta(hours=i)).strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                hour_index = i % 24\n                value = hourly_avgs[hour_index]\n                print(f\"{date_str}  {value:.3f}\")\n\n 43. But note: the input data had 6 decimal places? But we are rounding to 3. The example output in the input had 3 decimal places (like 12.123000) but we can output 3 decimal places.\n\n 44. We'll output with 3 decimal places and without the extra zeros? Actually, the input had 6, but we can output 3. The problem does not specify.\n\n 45. Since the input had 6, we can do 6? But the values we have are rounded to 3. So we can output as 11.152000? \n\n     However, the problem says: \"give me the complete data\" and the example had 6 decimal places. So we output 6 decimal places by formatting to 3 decimal places and then appending three zeros? \n\n     Actually, we can do: \"{:.3f}000\". But that would be wrong.\n\n     Alternatively, we can format to 6 decimal places: \"{:.6f}\". But note: if we have 11.152, then 6 decimal is 11.152000.\n\n     So we do: format the number to have 6 decimal places: `f\"{value:.6f}\"` but we only have 3 digits? \n\n     Actually, we computed the average and rounded to 3 decimal places. Then we can output as:\n\n          f\"{value:.3f}000\"\n\n     But that is not necessary. We can do:\n\n          formatted_value = format(round(avg, 3), '.6f')   -> but that would add zeros.\n\n     Example: 11.152 -> 11.152000\n\n     But note: the input had 6 decimal places, so we output 6.\n\n 46. Alternatively, we can output the number with 6 decimal places without rounding the average? \n\n     We can compute the average and then format to 6 decimal places? But the average might have more than 3 decimal places? \n\n     We are rounding to 3 decimal places for the average? Then we output 3 decimal places? \n\n     The problem does not specify. We'll output with 6 decimal places by formatting the number to 6 decimal places.\n\n     Example: \n\n         value = 11.15225 -> if we format to 6 decimal places: 11.152250? \n\n     But we are rounding to 3 decimal places: 11.152 -> then 11.152000.\n\n     So we do:\n\n         avg = round(total / 4, 3)   # so we have 3 decimal places\n         then format to string: \"{:.6f}\".format(avg) -> this will add three zeros.\n\n     But note: if the average is 11.152, then formatting to 6 decimal places gives \"11.152000\"\n\n 47.
