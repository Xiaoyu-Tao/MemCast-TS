        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-05-09 00:00:00 to 2017-05-12 23:00:00) for the \"HULL\" (High UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The user says \"these data will have missing values\", but the provided data does not have any missing values in the given 96 points.\n    However, we must be cautious. Since the problem states that the data will have missing values, we should impute them if present. But in the provided data, there are no missing values.\n\n 2. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead. Given the hourly frequency, we have 4 days of data (96 hours) and we are to forecast the next 4 days (96 hours).\n\n 3. We must use a time series forecasting method that can handle the potential seasonality and patterns. The data shows:\n    - Daily seasonality: There appears to be a daily pattern (e.g., lower values at night, higher during the day?).\n    - However, note that the data is labeled \"High UseLess Load\", and the values are relatively low (mostly between 1 and 4).\n\n 4. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we have hourly data and expect daily seasonality (24 hours), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. Given the small data size (only 96 points) and the need to forecast 96 points, we can use:\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n    - Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with seasonality.\n\n 6. However, note that the data might have non-integer values and we are to forecast 96 points. We must be cautious because the data might have multiple seasonality (e.g., daily and weekly) but we only have 4 days (so we cannot capture weekly). Therefore, we will assume daily seasonality.\n\n 7. Steps for modeling:\n    a. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n    b. If non-stationary, we may need to difference (both regular and seasonal).\n    c. Fit a model (like SARIMA) and forecast.\n\n 8. But note: the data has a lot of fluctuations and the pattern is not very clear. We might also consider a simpler model if the data is noisy.\n\n 9. Given the constraints (only 4 days of history) and the requirement to forecast 4 days, we can try:\n    - Using a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the last available day? But we have 4 days of history, so we can take the average of the same hour over the 4 days? \n    - However, the problem says we are to forecast the next 96 dates, so we can use the last day (2017-05-12) and repeat it? But that would be too simplistic.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use an automated model like Prophet or ETS, but we are limited by the data.\n\n 11. Since we are in a text-based environment and must provide code, we can use the `statsmodels` library for SARIMA.\n\n 12. However, note: the problem does not to write code but to provide the forecasted data. We are to output the next 96 timestamps and the corresponding HULL values.\n\n 13. We must generate the next 96 timestamps: starting from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n 14. Approach:\n     - We'll use an automated ARIMA model that selects the best parameters by AIC (like auto_arima) but we cannot run code here.\n     - Alternatively, we can describe the process and then provide the forecast.\n\n 15. But note: the instruction says \"You are an expert\", so we are expected to know how to forecast.\n\n 16. Given the complexity and the fact that we cannot run code in this environment, we have to simulate the process in our mind and provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n 17. However, the problem says we must provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. So we have to generate 96 numbers.\n\n 18. Considering the data pattern:\n\n     Looking at the provided data:\n\n        - The values range from about 1.2 to 3.9.\n        - There is a daily pattern: \n            * The load tends to be higher during the day (from 00:00 to 23:00) but we see that the highest values are not at the same time every day.\n\n        For example:\n\n          2017-05-09: peaks at 05:00 (3.684) and 11:00 (3.416), then drops in the evening.\n          2017-05-10: peaks at 06:00 (3.215) and 11:00 (3.215) and 13:00 (3.349).\n          2017-05-11: peaks at 00:00 (2.746) and 06:00 (3.081) and 11:00 (2.813) but 11:00 on 2017-05-11 is 2.813, which is not the highest? \n\n        Actually, the pattern is not very consistent. \n\n 19. Given the challenge, we might use a simple average of the same hour over the 4 days to forecast the next 4 days? But that would be the same for each day.\n\n     Example for hour 00:00: \n        May-09: 2.880\n        May-10: 2.545\n        May-11: 2.746\n        May-12: 2.746\n        Average = (2.880+2.545+2.746+2.746)/4 = 2.72925\n\n     Then for the next 4 days, every 00:00 would be 2.72925? But that ignores any trend and the fact that the last day might be more relevant.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour.\n\n 21. Since the problem says we must be aware of missing values (though none in the provided data) and we are to forecast, we can use:\n\n     - We'll take the average of each hour across the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the same hour in the next 4 days.\n\n 22. Steps for the next 96 hours (from 2017-05-13 00:00:00 to 2017-05-16 23:00:00) we have 24 hours * 4 days = 96 hours.\n\n For hour h (0 to 23), we compute:\n\n     HULL_forecast(h) = (value of h on May-09 + value of h on May-10 + value of h on May-11 + value of h on May-12) / 4\n\n 23. But note: the data for each day is 24 hours? Yes, we have 96 points (4*24).\n\n 24. Let's do an example for hour 0 (00:00:00):\n\n        May-09: 2.880\n        May-10: 2.545\n        May-11: 2.746\n        May-12: 2.746\n\n        Average = (2.880 + 2.545 + 2.746 + 2.746) / 4 = 2.72925\n\n     For hour 1 (01:00:00):\n\n        May-09: 3.081\n        May-10: 2.344\n        May-11: 2.277\n        May-12: 2.947\n\n        Average = (3.081 + 2.344 + 2.277 + 2.947) / 4 = 2.66225\n\n     And so on.\n\n 25. However, this method will produce the same pattern for each of the next 4 days. That is, the forecast for 2017-05-13, 2017-05-14, 2017-05-15, 2017-05-16 will be identical by hour.\n\n 26. Is this acceptable? It is a simple and common method for short-term forecasting when we have multiple seasons and limited data.\n\n 27. Alternatively, we could use the last day (May-12) as the forecast for the next days? But that would be even simpler.\n\n 28. Considering the instruction and the fact that we have to provide the data, we choose the average method.\n\n 29. We must generate 96 data points: 4 days, each day having 24 hours, and for each hour we use the average of that hour over the past 4 days.\n\n 30. Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n        hour0: (2.880 + 2.545 + 2.746 + 2.746) / 4 = 2.72925\n        hour1: (3.081 + 2.344 + 2.277 + 2.947) / 4 = 2.66225\n        hour2: (2.880 + 2.746 + 2.210 + 2.411) / 4 = 2.56175\n        hour3: (3.014 + 2.746 + 2.545 + 2.813) / 4 = 2.7795\n        hour4: (2.679 + 2.947 + 2.545 + 3.081) / 4 = 2.813\n        hour5: (3.684 + 3.014 + 2.277 + 2.746) / 4 = 2.93025\n        hour6: (3.014 + 3.215 + 3.081 + 2.344) / 4 = 2.9135\n        hour7: (2.813 + 2.411 + 1.808 + 1.808) / 4 = 2.210\n        hour8: (2.344 + 2.210 + 1.608 + 1.340) / 4 = 1.8755\n        hour9: (2.679 + 2.545 + 1.741 + 1.273) / 4 = 2.0595\n        hour10: (2.746 + 2.880 + 1.407 + 1.340) / 4 = 2.09325\n        hour11: (3.416 + 3.215 + 2.813 + 3.081) / 4 = 3.13125\n        hour12: (3.081 + 2.880 + 1.942 + 1.273) / 4 = 2.294\n        hour13: (3.349 + 3.349 + 1.474 + 2.277) / 4 = 2.61225\n        hour14: (3.215 + 3.215 + 1.340 + 1.808) / 4 = 2.3945\n        hour15: (2.880 + 2.746 + 1.407 + 2.009) / 4 = 2.2605\n        hour16: (2.009 + 2.009 + 1.942 + 1.206) / 4 = 1.7915\n        hour17: (1.608 + 1.674 + 1.674 + 1.273) / 4 = 1.55725\n        hour18: (1.474 + 1.273 + 1.340 + 1.273) / 4 = 1.34\n        hour19: (1.608 + 1.407 + 1.340 + 1.608) / 4 = 1.49075\n        hour20: (1.608 + 1.340 + 1.273 + 1.942) / 4 = 1.54075\n        hour21: (1.608 + 1.541 + 1.340 + 1.808) / 4 = 1.57425\n        hour22: (1.407 + 1.340 + 1.340 + 1.674) / 4 = 1.44025\n        hour23: (1.942 + 1.608 + 1.340 + 1.608) / 4 = 1.6245\n\n 31. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (2017-05-13 to 2017-05-16) will be:\n\n        Day1 (2017-05-13): [2.72925, 2.66225, 2.56175, ... , 1.6245]  (24 values)\n        Day2 (2017-05-14): same 24 values as above\n        Day3 (2017-05-15): same\n        Day4 (2017-05-16): same\n\n 32. We round to 3 decimal places? The original data had 3 decimals. So we round each average to 3 decimals.\n\n        hour0: 2.729 -> 2.729 (but 2.72925 rounded to 3 decimals is 2.729)\n        Actually, let's compute and round:\n\n        We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimal places.\n\n        hour0: 2.72925 -> 2.729\n        hour1: 2.66225 -> 2.662\n        hour2: 2.56175 -> 2.562\n        hour3: 2.7795 -> 2.780\n        hour4: 2.813 -> 2.813\n        hour5: 2.93025 -> 2.930\n        hour6: 2.9135 -> 2.914\n        hour7: 2.210 -> 2.210\n        hour8: 1.8755 -> 1.876\n        hour9: 2.0595 -> 2.060\n        hour10: 2.09325 -> 2.093\n        hour11: 3.13125 -> 3.131\n        hour12: 2.294 -> 2.294\n        hour13: 2.61225 -> 2.612\n        hour14: 2.3945 -> 2.395\n        hour15: 2.2605 -> 2.261\n        hour16: 1.7915 -> 1.792\n        hour17: 1.55725 -> 1.557\n        hour18: 1.34 -> 1.340   (because 1.34 is 1.340)\n        hour19: 1.49075 -> 1.491\n        hour20: 1.54075 -> 1.541\n        hour21: 1.57425 -> 1.574\n        hour22: 1.44025 -> 1.440\n        hour23: 1.6245 -> 1.625\n\n 33. Now, we write the next 96 timestamps:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-13 00:00:00, then 01:00:00, ... up to 2017-05-16 23:00:00.\n\n        For 2017-05-13:\n           00:00:00 -> 2.729\n           01:00:00 -> 2.662\n           02:00:00 -> 2.562\n           03:00:00 -> 2.780\n           04:00:00 -> 2.813\n           05:00:00 -> 2.930\n           06:00:00 -> 2.914\n           07:00:00 -> 2.210\n           08:00:00 -> 1.876\n           09:00:00 -> 2.060\n           10:00:00 -> 2.093\n           11:00:00 -> 3.131\n           12:00:00 -> 2.294\n           13:00:00 -> 2.612\n           14:00:00 -> 2.395\n           15:00:00 -> 2.261\n           16:00:00 -> 1.792\n           17:00:00 -> 1.557\n           18:00:00 -> 1.340\n           19:00:00 -> 1.491\n           20:00:00 -> 1.541\n           21:00:00 -> 1.574\n           22:00:00 -> 1.440\n           23:00:00 -> 1.625\n\n        Then repeat the same 24 values for the next three days.\n\n 34. But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? We are not given any in the history, so we assume the history is complete.\n\n 35. We output the data in the same format as the input: two columns (date and HULL), with the date in the same format.\n\n 36. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2017-05-13 00:00:00\n        End:   2017-05-16 23:00:00\n\n        We can use pandas date_range in code, but here we write them manually? Actually, we can generate:\n\n        Day 13: 00,01,...,23\n        Day 14: 00,01,...,23\n        Day 15: 00,01,...,23\n        Day 16: 00,01,...,23\n\n 37. We write the data in the required format.\n\n 38. However, note: the original data had 3 decimal places. We rounded to 3 decimals.\n\n 39. Let's write the data:\n\n        We have 96 lines.\n\n 40. We output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2017-05-13 00:00:00 2.729\n2017-05-13 01:00:00 2.662\n2017-05-13 02:00:00 2.562\n2017-05-13 03:00:00 2.780\n2017-05-13 04:00:00 2.813\n2017-05-13 05:00:00 2.930\n2017-05-13 06:00:00 2.914\n2017-05-13 07:00:00 2.210\n2017-05-13 08:00:00 1.876\n2017-05-13 09:00:00 2.060\n2017-05-13 10:00:00 2.093\n2017-05-13 11:00:00 3.131\n2017-05-13 12:00:00 2.294\n2017-05-13 13:00:00 2.612\n2017-05-13 14:00:00 2.395\n2017-05-13 15:00:00 2.261\n2017-05-13 16:00:00 1.792\n2017-05-13 17:00:00 1.557\n2017-05-13 18:00:00 1.340\n2017-05-13 19:00:00 1.491\n2017-05-13 20:00:00 1.541\n2017-05-13 21:00:00 1.574\n2017-05-13 22:00:00 1.440\n2017-05-13 23:00:00 1.625\n2017-05-14 00:00:00 2.729\n2017-05-14 01:00:00 2.662\n... and so on for 14, 15, 16.\n\n 41. We repeat the same 24 numbers for each day.\n\n 42. We write the entire 96 lines.\n\n 43. Note: We must not omit any.\n\n 44. Let's do it.\n\n 45. However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 46. We output the data as described.\n\n 47. But note: the original data had the date format as \"2017-05-09 00:00:00\", so we use the same.\n\n 48. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 49. Since the forecast is the same for each day, we can generate:\n\n        dates = []\n        start_date = \"2017-05-13\"\n        for day in range(4): # 13,14,15,16\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"{start_date[:8]}{13+day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                # But note: the day might be two digits? 13,14,15,16 -> all two digits.\n                # However, the string for day: we have to format the day as two digits?

We'll generate the dates and then assign the value based on the hour.\n\n 51. We have the list of hourly averages (24 values) as computed above.\n\n 52. We write the data.\n\n 53.
