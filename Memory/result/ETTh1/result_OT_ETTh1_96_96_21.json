        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for oil temperature (OT) from 2016-09-23 00:00:00 to 2016-09-26 23:00:00.\n We are to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. The data has hourly frequency. We note that the data shows a daily pattern (temperature rises during the day and falls at night).\n 2. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. However, the problem states that the data may have missing values, so we should be cautious. Since the given data for the past 96 is complete, we can proceed to model and forecast.\n 3. We are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n\n Approach:\n Given the daily seasonality (period=24) and the relatively short length of the data, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trend.\n\n We can use:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or\n   - Prophet by Facebook, but since we are to output without using external libraries explicitly, we can simulate a simple model.\n\n However, note: We are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates. We must output 96 data points.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to act as an expert, we choose a robust method.\n\n Considering the data size and frequency, we can use:\n   - A seasonal decomposition and then forecast the components, or\n   - Use a simple seasonal naive model? But that might not capture trends.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an automated model like ARIMA with grid search for parameters? But without a library, it's hard.\n\n However, note: We are to provide the data, not the code. So we can use any method and then output the forecast.\n\n But the problem: We are in a text-based environment and cannot run code. So we must rely on a simple method that we can describe.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a method that:\n   - Extracts the daily seasonality by averaging the same hour of the day for the available 4 days (since we have 4 days: 23,24,25,26).\n   - Then, we adjust for the trend. However, the trend over 4 days might be minimal? Let's check the data: \n        The last 4 days: \n          23rd: min ~19.1, max ~27.0\n          24th: min ~20.5, max ~27.5\n          25th: min ~21.7, max ~27.2\n          26th: min ~21.9, max ~27.3\n        There is no clear upward or downward trend in the overall level? \n\n   - Alternatively, we can use the last day (26th) and add the average hourly change from the previous days? \n\n Since we have only 4 days, we can compute the average daily pattern and then use the last day as the base and adjust by the average hourly pattern? \n\n But note: the problem says the data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points there are none. So we can compute the average for each hour.\n\n Steps for a simple model:\n   - Group by hour of the day (0 to 23) and compute the average for that hour over the 4 days.\n   - Then, we use that average pattern for the next 4 days (27th to 30th). \n\n However, this ignores any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to model a trend. Also, the temperature might be stable.\n\n But let's check: \n   The last hour of the last day (2016-09-26 23:00:00) is 23.215.\n   The average for hour 23 from the 4 days: \n        23rd: 21.737\n        24th: 23.003\n        25th: 23.426\n        26th: 23.215\n        Average = (21.737+23.003+23.426+23.215)/4 = 22.84525\n\n   So if we use the average pattern, the hour 23 of the next day (27th) would be 22.845, which is lower than the last observed 23.215.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (26th) and then add the average hourly change from the previous days? \n\n   Another idea: use the average daily pattern but adjust by the difference between the last day and the overall average? \n\n   We can compute:\n        base = the last day (26th) as a vector of 24 hours.\n        Then, for each hour in the next day, we take the value from the same hour of the last day and add the average change from the same hour in the previous days? \n\n   But we don't have a day after the 26th to compute change.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average seasonal pattern and then adjust by the level of the last day? \n\n   We can do:\n        Let A = average of the entire last day (26th) -> let's compute: \n            average of 26th: \n                00: 22.652, 01:22.792, 02:22.863, 03:22.370, 04:22.441, 05:22.089, 06:22.089, 07:21.878, 08:22.581, 09:23.566, 10:24.340, 11:25.255, 12:26.310, 13:27.154, 14:27.295, 15:27.154, 16:27.084, 17:26.802, 18:25.677, 19:24.692, 20:24.059, 21:23.988, 22:23.637, 23:23.215\n            total = 22.652+22.792+22.863+22.370+22.441+22.089+22.089+21.878+22.581+23.566+24.340+25.255+26.310+27.154+27.295+27.154+27.084+26.802+25.677+24.692+24.059+23.988+23.637+23.215 =  Let me compute step by step:\n\n        We can compute the average of the last day: \n            Sum = 22.652+22.792+22.863+22.370+22.441+22.089+22.089+21.878+22.581+23.566+24.340+25.255+26.310+27.154+27.295+27.154+27.084+26.802+25.677+24.692+24.059+23.988+23.637+23.215\n            = 22.652+22.792 = 45.444\n            +22.863 = 68.307\n            +22.370 = 90.677\n            +22.441 = 113.118\n            +22.089 = 135.207\n            +22.089 = 157.296\n            +21.878 = 179.174\n            +22.581 = 201.755\n            +23.566 = 225.321\n            +24.340 = 249.661\n            +25.255 = 274.916\n            +26.310 = 301.226\n            +27.154 = 328.38\n            +27.295 = 355.675\n            +27.154 = 382.829\n            +27.084 = 409.913\n            +26.802 = 436.715\n            +25.677 = 462.392\n            +24.692 = 487.084\n            +24.059 = 511.143\n            +23.988 = 535.131\n            +23.637 = 558.768\n            +23.215 = 581.983\n\n            Average for 26th = 581.983 / 24 = 24.2492916667\n\n        Now, the overall average of the entire 4 days? \n            We have 96 points: \n            We can compute the average of the entire data: \n                But we don't have to, because we are going to use the average pattern.\n\n        Let S_h be the average for hour h over the 4 days.\n\n        Then, for the next day (27th) at hour h, we can set:\n            OT_{27,h} = (S_h / overall_avg) * (level of the last day)   [this is multiplicative adjustment]\n\n        But we don't have the overall_avg? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use an additive adjustment? \n\n        We can compute the overall average of the 4 days: \n            We have 96 points, we can compute the average. But we don't have the exact numbers for all? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last day (24.249) and the average of the entire 4 days? \n\n        But note: the average of the entire 4 days is the same as the average of the 4 daily averages? \n\n        Let A_d be the average of day d, then overall_avg = (A_23 + A_24 + A_25 + A_26) /4.\n\n        We have:\n            Day23: \n                min:19.134, max:27.013 -> but we can compute the average? \n                We don't have the exact average for day23, but we can compute it. \n\n        However, we are to avoid too much manual calculation. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a multiplicative seasonal pattern without level adjustment? \n\n        But the level of the last day is 24.249, and the average of the seasonal pattern (S_h for h=0..23) is the same as the overall average? \n\n        Actually, the average of the 24 S_h values is the overall average of the entire dataset? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            overall_avg = (S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_23) / 24   [but note: we have 4 days, so the overall average of the entire dataset is the same as the average of the 24 S_h?]\n\n        Actually, the average of the entire dataset is the same as the average of the 24 S_h? \n\n        Yes, because each S_h is the average of 4 values, and then the average of the 24 S_h is the average of the entire dataset.\n\n        So let:\n            overall_avg = (sum_{h=0}^{23} S_h) / 24\n\n        Then, the multiplicative factor for the last day is: level = 24.249 (the average of the last day)\n\n        Then, the forecast for hour h on the 27th: \n            OT_{27,h} = S_h * (level / overall_avg)\n\n        But note: the level of the last day is 24.249, and overall_avg is the average of the entire 4 days? \n\n        However, we don't have the entire dataset average? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use an additive model:\n\n            OT_{27,h} = S_h + (level - overall_avg)\n\n        But we don't know the overall_avg? \n\n        We can compute the overall_avg from the 96 points? \n\n        We have 96 points, we can compute the average. \n\n        But we are to avoid manual calculation? \n\n        Since we are to provide the forecast, we can do:\n\n            Step 1: Compute the average for each hour of the day (0-23) over the 4 days -> 24 values.\n            Step 2: Compute the overall average (over the 96 points) -> call it T_avg.\n            Step 3: Compute the average of the last day (26th) -> D26_avg = 24.249.\n            Step 4: Then, the forecast for the next day (27th) at hour h: \n                    OT_{27,h} = S_h + (D26_avg - T_avg)\n\n        This is an additive adjustment.\n\n        Then for the 28th, 29th, 30th, we can use the same pattern? \n\n        But note: we don't adjusting for trend? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n        However, the problem says the data is from July 2016 to July 2018, but we are given only 4 days? \n\n        We are only given 4 days? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"I will now give you data for the past 96 recorded dates\", which is 4 days (96 hours). \n\n        So we have only 4 days. \n\n        Therefore, we can use the same pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n        But note: the temperature might have a trend? \n\n        Looking at the data: \n            The average of day23: \n                We can compute: \n                Day23: \n                    data: 21.104, 20.682, 21.737 -> 24 points? \n                    We can compute the average for day23: \n                    ... it's too long. \n\n        Alternatively, we can assume that the level is stable and use the average pattern for the next 4 days? \n\n        Since we don't have a clear trend, we can use the average pattern without adjustment? \n\n        But the forecast for the next 4 days would be the same as the average pattern? \n\n        Then the 27th would be the same as the average of the 23rd,24th,25th,26th for each hour? \n\n        However, the last day (26th) was a bit different? \n\n        We can use the last day as the base and then add the average daily change? \n\n        But we don't have the daily change? \n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide the data, we choose:\n\n            We compute the average for each hour over the 4 days and use that as the forecast for the next 4 days? \n\n        Why 4 days? Because we have 4 days of history, and we are forecasting 4 days? \n\n        But note: the next 4 days might be similar? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify any external factors (like load, weather, etc.), so we rely on the pattern.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we have 4 values (from 23rd,24th,25th,26th). We take the 4 values and average them.\n\n            Then, for the next 4 days (27th,28th,29th,30th), we assign the average for hour0 of the 27th, then hour1, ... hour23 for day27, then repeat the same pattern for day28, day29, day30.\n\n        But note: the 4 days of history might have a slight trend? \n\n        We can check the overall average per day:\n\n            Day23: \n                We compute: \n                ... we have the data, but we can approximate? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use the trend by linear regression? But without code, it's hard.\n\n        Given the time, we are to provide the data, we decide to use the average pattern without trend.\n\n        We compute the average for each hour:\n\n            Hour 0: (21.104 + 21.737 + 22.722 + 22.652) / 4 = (21.104+21.737=42.841; +22.722=65.563; +22.652=88.215) -> 88.215/4 = 22.05375\n            Hour 1: (20.682 + 21.597 + 22.652 + 22.792) / 4 = (20.682+21.597=42.279; +22.652=64.931; +22.792=87.723) -> 21.93075\n            Hour 2: (20.682 + 21.667 + 22.300 + 22.863) / 4 = (20.682+21.667=42.349; +22.300=64.649; +22.863=87.512) -> 21.878\n            Hour 3: (19.979 + 21.245 + 22.089 + 22.370) / 4 = (19.979+21.245=41.224; +22.089=63.313; +22.370=85.683) -> 21.42075\n            Hour 4: (19.416 + 20.752 + 22.089 + 22.441) / 4 = (19.416+20.752=40.168; +22.089=62.257; +22.441=84.698) -> 21.1745\n            Hour 5: (19.134 + 20.682 + 21.737 + 22.089) / 4 = (19.134+20.682=39.816; +21.737=61.553; +22.089=83.642) -> 20.9105\n            Hour 6: (19.134 + 20.541 + 21.667 + 22.089) / 4 = (19.134+20.541=39.675; +21.667=61.342; +22.089=83.431) -> 20.85775\n            Hour 7: (19.838 + 21.174 + 22.230 + 21.878) / 4 = (19.838+21.174=41.012; +22.230=63.242; +21.878=85.120) -> 21.28\n            Hour 8: (20.612 + 22.019 + 22.511 + 22.581) / 4 = (20.612+22.019=42.631; +22.511=65.142; +22.581=87.723) -> 21.93075\n            Hour 9: (20.893 + 22.652 + 23.777 + 23.566) / 4 = (20.893+22.652=43.545; +23.777=67.322; +23.566=90.888) -> 22.722\n            Hour10: (22.581 + 23.988 + 24.551 + 24.340) / 4 = (22.581+23.988=46.569; +24.551=71.120; +24.340=95.460) -> 23.865\n            Hour11: (22.581 + 24.481 + 24.692 + 25.255) / 4 = (22.581+24.481=47.062; +24.692=71.754; +25.255=97.009) -> 24.25225\n            Hour12: (23.566 + 25.466 + 25.677 + 26.310) / 4 = (23.566+25.466=49.032; +25.677=74.709; +26.310=101.019) -> 25.25475\n            Hour13: (25.466 + 27.224 + 26.450 + 27.154) / 4 = (25.466+27.224=52.690; +26.450=79.140; +27.154=106.294) -> 26.5735\n            Hour14: (26.732 + 27.506 + 27.154 + 27.295) / 4 = (26.732+27.506=54.238; +27.154=81.392; +27.295=108.687) -> 27.17175\n            Hour15: (26.662 + 27.084 + 27.224 + 27.154) / 4 = (26.662+27.084=53.746; +27.224=80.970; +27.154=108.124) -> 27.031\n            Hour16: (27.013 + 26.802 + 26.943 + 27.084) / 4 = (27.013+26.802=53.815; +26.943=80.758; +27.084=107.842) -> 26.9605\n            Hour17: (26.239 + 26.169 + 26.450 + 26.802) / 4 = (26.239+26.169=52.408; +26.450=78.858; +26.802=105.660) -> 26.415\n            Hour18: (24.621 + 24.903 + 25.747 + 25.677) / 4 = (24.621+24.903=49.524; +25.747=75.271; +25.677=100.948) -> 25.237\n            Hour19: (23.144 + 24.199 + 25.255 + 24.692) / 4 = (23.144+24.199=47.343; +25.255=72.598; +24.692=97.290) -> 24.3225\n            Hour20: (23.074 + 24.340 + 24.340 + 24.059) / 4 = (23.074+24.340=47.414; +24.340=71.754; +24.059=95.813) -> 23.95325\n            Hour21: (22.089 + 23.496 + 23.988 + 23.988) / 4 = (22.089+23.496=45.585; +23.988=69.573; +23.988=93.561) -> 23.39025\n            Hour22: (22.370 + 23.285 + 23.637 + 23.637) / 4 = (22.370+23.285=45.655; +23.637=69.292; +23.637=92.929) -> 23.23225\n            Hour23: (21.737 + 23.003 + 23.426 + 23.215) / 4 = (21.737+23.003=44.740; +23.426=68.166; +23.215=91.381) -> 22.84525\n\n        Then, the forecast for the next 4 days (27th to 30th) will be:\n\n            Day27: \n                00:00: 22.05375\n                01:00: 21.93075\n                02:00: 21.878\n                03:00: 21.42075\n                04:00: 21.1745\n                05:00: 20.9105\n                06:00: 20.85775\n                07:00: 21.28\n                08:00: 21.93075\n                09:00: 22.722\n                10:00: 23.865\n                11:00: 24.25225\n                12:00: 25.25475\n                13:00: 26.5735\n                14:00: 27.17175\n                15:00: 27.031\n                16:00: 26.9605\n                17:00: 26.415\n                18:00: 25.237\n                19:00: 24.3225\n                20:00: 23.95325\n                21:00: 23.39025\n                22:00: 23.23225\n                23:00: 22.84525\n\n            Then, Day28, Day29, Day30: same as Day27? \n\n        But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are forecasting and we are to provide the complete data.\n\n        However, we are to forecast 96 points, which is 4 days. So we repeat the same pattern for 4 days? \n\n        But wait, the pattern might change? \n\n        Since we don't have any trend, we are using the average pattern, we use the same pattern for each of the next 4 days.\n\n        Therefore, the next 4 days (27th,28th,29th,30th) will have the same 24 values as above.\n\n        But note: the actual data might have a weekly pattern? But we don't have weekly data (only 4 days, not a week). \n\n        We output 96 points: 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n        However, the last day of the given data is 2016-09-26, so:\n\n            Day27: 2016-09-27\n            Day28: 2016-09-28\n            Day29: 2016-09-29\n            Day30: 2016-09-30\n\n        We generate the dates accordingly.\n\n        Format: \n            2016-09-27 00:00:00, 22.05375\n            2016-09-27 01:00:00, 21.93075\n            ... until\n            2016-09-30 23:00:00, 22.84525\n\n        But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? But we are generating the forecast without gaps.\n\n        We output the complete data.\n\n        However, we must output the same format: two columns: date and OT.\n\n        We must output 96 rows.\n\n        We'll output the date starting from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 and then incrementally.\n\n        We'll write the OT values with 6 decimal places? The input had 6 decimal places? \n\n        The input had: \n            21.104000 -> 6 decimal places.\n\n        So we output with 6 decimal places.\n\n        But our computed averages are with more than 6? We round to 6 decimal places.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n        So we output:\n\n            date, OT\n\n        in the same format.\n\n        But note: the input had the date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\n        We generate:\n\n            2016-09-27 00:00:00, [value]\n            2016-09-27 01:00:00, [value]\n            ...\n\n        We'll generate the next 96 hours.\n\n        Let's do:\n\n            Start: 2016-09-27 00:00:00\n            Then 2016-09-27 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-27 23:00:00\n            Then 2016-09-28 00:00:00, ... until 2016-09-28 23:00:00\n            Then 2016-09-29 00:00:00, ... until 2016-09-29 23:00:00\n            Then 2016-09-30 00:00:00, ... until 2016-09-30 23:00:00\n\n        Total 96.\n\n        We'll use the 24 values we computed for each hour, and repeat the same 24 values for each day.\n\n        However, note: the pattern might be the same for each day? \n\n        But we have no information to suggest a weekly pattern, so we use the same daily pattern.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            For each day in [27,28,29,30]:\n                for hour in 0,1,...,23:\n                    OT = the average we computed for that hour (rounded to 6 decimal places)\n\n        Let's write the 24 values for the hours (0 to 23) that we computed, rounded to 6 decimal places:\n\n            h0: 22.05375 -> 22.053750\n            h1: 21.93075 -> 21.930750\n            h2: 21.878   -> 21.878000\n            h3: 21.42075 -> 21.420750\n            h4: 21.1745  -> 21.174500\n            h5: 20.9105  -> 20.910500\n            h6: 20.85775 -> 20.857750\n            h7: 21.28    -> 21.280000\n            h8: 21.93075 -> 21.930750\n            h9: 22.722   -> 22.722000\n            h10:23.865   -> 23.865000\n            h11:24.25225 -> 24.252250\n            h12:25.25475 -> 25.254750\n            h13:26.5735  -> 26.573500\n            h14:27.17175 -> 27.171750\n            h15:27.031   -> 27.031000\n            h16:26.9605  -> 26.960500\n            h17:26.415   -> 26.415000\n            h18:25.237   -> 25.237000\n            h19:24.3225  -> 24.322500\n            h20:23.95325 -> 23.953250\n            h21:23.39025 -> 23.390250\n            h22:23.23225 -> 23.232250\n            h23:22.84525 -> 22.845250\n\n        Then, we repeat these 24 values for 4 days.\n\n        We write the dates accordingly.\n\n        We must be cautious: the last given date was 2016-09-26 23:00:00, so the next is 2016-09-27 00:00:00.\n\n        We generate:\n\n            date: from 2016-09-27 00:00:00 to 2016-09-30 23:00:00.\n\n        We output in the same format.\n\n        We write the answer in the required format.\n\n        Note: We are to output the data only, without any additional text.\n\n        Format:\n\n            <answer>\n            date,OT\n            2016-09-27 00:00:00,22.053750\n            2016-09-27 01:00:00,21.930750\n            ... \n            </answer>\n\n        But note: the input had the column names: \"date\" and \"OT\", but the problem did not say to include the header? \n\n        The example provided did not have a header? \n\n        The example:\n\n               date        OT\n        2016-09-23 00:00:00 21.104000\n\n        But in the data block, it had the header? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Please give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\"\n\n        And the example data they provided included the header? \n\n        But in the output, we are to provide only the data? \n\n        The problem says: \"remember to give me the complete data\" and \"You must provide the complete data.\"\n\n        The complete data should include the header? \n\n        The example input had:\n\n            \"               date        OT\"\n\n        and then the data. \n\n        But in the output, we are to provide the data in the same way? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"And your final answer must follow the format\"\n\n        and the format is:\n\n            <answer>\n\n            ...\n\n            ```\n\n            ...\n\n            ```\n\n            </answer>\n\n        And the example, they did not show the header? \n\n        But to be safe, we output without the header? \n\n        The problem says: \"the complete data\", meaning the 96 rows of data? \n\n        The example input had 96 rows of data (without the header in the data block). \n\n        So we output 96 rows of data without the header.\n\n        We output:\n\n            [date string] [OT value]\n\n        with the same columns.\n\n        But the input had the date string and then the OT value in the same row, separated by space? \n\n        Actually, the input was given as:\n\n            \"2016-09-23 00:00:00 21.104000\"\n\n        But in the example, it was aligned? \n\n        We can output:\n\n            [date string] [OT value with 6 decimal places]\n\n        We'll use: \n\n            \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS {value}\"\n\n        But the input had the value aligned? We don't need to align, just the data.\n\n        We output:\n\n            \"2016-09-27 00:00:00 22.053750\"\n\n        etc.\n\n        However, the problem example had:\n\n            \"2016-09-23 00:00:00 21.104000\"\n\n        So we output in the same style.\n\n        We'll generate 96 lines.\n\n        Let's do it.\n\n        Note: We are to output exactly 96 lines.\n\n        We'll generate:\n\n            for day in 27, 28, 29, 30:\n                for hour in 0 to 23:\n                    date_str = \"2016-09-{day} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n                    OT = the value for that hour (from the 24 values we computed)\n\n        But note: the day must be two digits: 27 -> '27', etc.\n\n        We write:\n\n            Line 1: \"2016-09-27 00:00:00 22.053750\"\n            Line 2: \"2016-09-27 01:00:00 21.930750\"\n            ...\n            Line 24: \"2016-09-27 23:00:00 22.845250\"\n            Line 25: \"2016-09-28 00:00:00 22.053750\"\n            ... until Line 96: \"2016-09-30 23:00:00 22.845250\"\n\n        We output in the <answer> block.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the data may have missing values?
