        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low UseFul Load (LUFL) from 2016-08-18 00:00:00 to 2016-08-21 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of LUFL data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and also weekly patterns might be present (but we only have 4 days, so weekly is not evident).\n 2. Given the short history, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality. Since the data is hourly, the seasonal period is 24.\n 3. We must handle potential missing values, but the provided history does not have any missing values in the given 96 points? However, the problem says the data will have missing values. But the provided history is complete. For forecasting, we assume the model can handle missing values by imputation, but here we are only given a complete block. We are to forecast the next 96 without gaps.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a seasonal time series model. Given the data is relatively short, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: but it might not capture trends well.\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n   - SARIMA: but with 96 points, we have to be cautious about overfitting.\n\n However, note: the problem says the data has missing values, but the provided 96 points are complete. For forecasting, we are to produce 96 points without any missing values.\n\n Since the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: lower during the night and higher during the day, but with two peaks? (one in the morning and one in the evening?).\n   - Also, there is a drop in the middle of the day on some days (like 2016-08-20).\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement for 96 points, we can use a simple but effective method: \n   - We decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual. Then forecast each component? \n   - Alternatively, we can use a model that automatically handles seasonality.\n\n Given the constraints, I choose to use the Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) and then forecast the seasonally adjusted data with an appropriate method (like ETS or ARIMA) and then add the seasonal component. However, with only 4 days, the trend might be unstable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the last 4 days for each hour? That would be a seasonal naive with averaging. But note the data might have a trend? Let's check:\n\n The last 4 days (from 2016-08-18 to 2016-08-21) do not show a clear upward or downward trend overall, but there are daily fluctuations.\n\n Since we are to forecast 4 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 4 days. But note: we only have 4 days, so we can take the average for each hour of the day.\n\n However, let's look at the data: \n   - The first day (2016-08-18) and the last day (2016-08-21) are both Thursday? Actually, 2016-08-18 is Thursday, then Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n We don't have a full week, so we cannot account for weekly seasonality. Therefore, we assume the pattern is daily.\n\n Steps for the average method:\n   - For each hour in the day (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the 4 days we have.\n   - Then, for the next 4 days (96 hours), we use the average for the corresponding hour of the day.\n\n But note: the data on 2016-08-20 (Saturday) and 2016-08-21 (Sunday) might be different from weekdays? However, we don't have enough data to model weekly seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (Sunday) as the pattern for the next day (Monday) might be similar? But we don't know. Since we are limited, we'll use the average of the 4 days.\n\n However, let's check the pattern for each day:\n\n   Hour 0: [7.219, 4.934, 5.239, 3.259] -> average = (7.219+4.934+5.239+3.259)/4 = 5.16275\n   Hour 1: [6.762, 4.660, 4.782, 2.924] -> (6.762+4.660+4.782+2.924)/4 = 4.782\n\n But we see that the Sunday (2016-08-21) has lower values? So if we are forecasting for Monday (2016-08-22) and then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we might not have the same pattern.\n\n Given the ambiguity, and the fact that we are only asked for 96 points (4 days) and we have 4 days of history, we will use the average by hour.\n\n However, note that the problem says the data has missing values. But in the provided history there are none. For the future forecast, we are to produce without missing values.\n\n We will generate the next 96 timestamps and the LUFL values as the average of the same hour in the past 4 days.\n\n Steps:\n   - The next timestamp after 2016-08-21 23:00:00 is 2016-08-22 00:00:00, then 2016-08-22 01:00:00, ... until 2016-08-25 23:00:00 (which is 96 hours later).\n\n   - For each hour H (0 to 23) in the day, we have 4 values: from day1 (2016-08-18), day2 (2016-08-19), day3 (2016-08-20), day4 (2016-08-21).\n\n   - The forecast for 2016-08-22 00:00:00 (which is hour0 of the first forecast day) = average of hour0 of the past 4 days.\n\n   - Similarly, 2016-08-22 01:00:00 = average of hour1 of the past 4 days.\n\n   - ... until 2016-08-22 23:00:00 = average of hour23 of the past 4 days.\n\n   - Then for 2016-08-23 00:00:00: same as 2016-08-22 00:00:00? But we are using the same average for each day? Actually, we are using the same set of averages for each of the next 4 days.\n\n   - So the pattern for each of the next 4 days will be identical? That might be acceptable because we don't have weekly data to adjust.\n\n But note: the problem says the data has missing values. We are not given any in the history, so we assume the history is complete. For the forecast, we are to produce without missing values.\n\n However, if we want to be more sophisticated, we could use an exponential smoothing by hour? But with only 4 points per hour, it's not much.\n\n Considering the above, we will use the average by hour.\n\n Let's compute the averages for each hour (0 to 23) from the 4 days:\n\n   hour0: (7.219 + 4.934 + 5.239 + 3.259) / 4 = 5.16275\n   hour1: (6.762 + 4.660 + 4.782 + 2.924) / 4 = 4.782\n   hour2: (6.335 + 4.386 + 4.447 + 2.772) / 4 = 4.485\n   hour3: (5.970 + 4.173 + 4.142 + 2.559) / 4 = 4.211\n   hour4: (5.604 + 3.716 + 3.807 + 2.315) / 4 = 3.8605\n   hour5: (5.635 + 3.746 + 3.625 + 2.345) / 4 = 3.83775\n   hour6: (5.940 + 3.838 + 3.686 + 2.680) / 4 = 4.036\n   hour7: (5.848 + 3.655 + 3.533 + 2.559) / 4 = 3.89875\n   hour8: (3.503 + 3.746 + 3.655 + 2.650) / 4 = 3.3885\n   hour9: (3.503 + 3.838 + 3.838 + 2.741) / 4 =  Wait, let me check:\n\n        Day1: 3.503\n        Day2: 3.746 -> actually, day2 hour8 is 3.746? The data: \n          2016-08-18 08:00:00 3.503\n          2016-08-19 08:00:00 3.746\n          2016-08-20 08:00:00 3.655\n          2016-08-21 08:00:00 2.650\n\n        So hour8: (3.503+3.746+3.655+2.650)/4 = 3.3885\n\n   hour9: \n        Day1: 3.503\n        Day2: 4.082\n        Day3: 3.838\n        Day4: 2.741\n        (3.503+4.082+3.838+2.741)/4 = 3.541\n\n   hour10:\n        Day1: 4.538\n        Day2: 5.178\n        Day3: 4.965\n        Day4: 3.350\n        (4.538+5.178+4.965+3.350)/4 = 4.50775\n\n   hour11:\n        Day1: 4.721\n        Day2: 5.483\n        Day3: 4.995\n        Day4: 3.807\n        (4.721+5.483+4.995+3.807)/4 = 4.7515\n\n   hour12:\n        Day1: 5.239\n        Day2: 5.787\n        Day3: 4.295 -> wait, day3 hour12: 2016-08-20 12:00:00 is 4.295? \n        Day4: 3.320\n        (5.239+5.787+4.295+3.320)/4 = 4.66025\n\n   hour13:\n        Day1: 5.909\n        Day2: 5.818\n        Day3: 4.051\n        Day4: 3.655\n        (5.909+5.818+4.051+3.655)/4 = 4.85825\n\n   hour14:\n        Day1: 5.391\n        Day2: 5.148\n        Day3: 4.142\n        Day4: 3.533\n        (5.391+5.148+4.142+3.533)/4 = 4.5535\n\n   hour15:\n        Day1: 5.330\n        Day2: 5.026\n        Day3: 3.503\n        Day4: 3.229\n        (5.330+5.026+3.503+3.229)/4 = 4.272\n\n   hour16:\n        Day1: 5.087\n        Day2: 4.995\n        Day3: 2.802\n        Day4: 3.168\n        (5.087+4.995+2.802+3.168)/4 = 4.013\n\n   hour17:\n        Day1: 5.026\n        Day2: 5.026\n        Day3: 4.082\n        Day4: 3.503\n        (5.026+5.026+4.082+3.503)/4 = 4.40925\n\n   hour18:\n        Day1: 4.752\n        Day2: 4.782\n        Day3: 2.284\n        Day4: 3.350\n        (4.752+4.782+2.284+3.350)/4 = 3.792\n\n   hour19:\n        Day1: 5.087\n        Day2: 6.122\n        Day3: 2.528\n        Day4: 3.472\n        (5.087+6.122+2.528+3.472)/4 = 4.30225\n\n   hour20:\n        Day1: 7.371\n        Day2: 7.523\n        Day3: 3.594\n        Day4: 5.300\n        (7.371+7.523+3.594+5.300)/4 = 5.947\n\n   hour21:\n        Day1: 6.823\n        Day2: 7.280\n        Day3: 4.599\n        Day4: 4.660\n        (6.823+7.280+4.599+4.660)/4 = 5.8405\n\n   hour22:\n        Day1: 6.000\n        Day2: 6.335\n        Day3: 3.868\n        Day4: 4.112\n        (6.000+6.335+3.868+4.112)/4 = 5.07875\n\n   hour23:\n        Day1: 5.726\n        Day2: 5.787\n        Day3: 3.381\n        Day4: 3.594\n        (5.726+5.787+3.381+3.594)/4 = 4.622\n\n Now, the next 96 hours (4 days) will be:\n\n   Day1: 2016-08-22 (Monday) -> we use the averages for hour0 to hour23 as above.\n   Day2: 2016-08-23 (Tuesday) -> same averages\n   Day3: 2016-08-24 (Wednesday) -> same\n   Day4: 2016-08-25 (Thursday) -> same\n\n But note: the last day of history is Sunday (2016-08-21). The next day is Monday, then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\n However, without weekly seasonality, we use the same daily pattern.\n\n Therefore, we generate:\n\n   Start: 2016-08-22 00:00:00 -> 5.16275\n          2016-08-22 01:00:00 -> 4.782\n          ... until 2016-08-22 23:00:00 -> 4.622\n\n   Then 2016-08-23 00:00:00 -> 5.16275 again, and so on.\n\n We'll write the numbers with 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input had 3 decimal places, but our average might have more. We'll round to 3 decimal places.\n\n However, the problem says: \"give me the complete data for the next 96 recorded dates\", meaning we must output 96 rows.\n\n Let's generate the timestamps:\n\n   Start: 2016-08-22 00:00:00\n   End:   2016-08-25 23:00:00\n\n We'll be:\n\n   2016-08-22 00:00:00, 5.163   (rounded to 3 decimals)\n   2016-08-22 01:00:00, 4.782\n   ...\n\n We'll create a list of 96 entries.\n\n However, note: the average for hour18 was 3.792 -> that's 3.792, so we can write as 3.792.\n\n But let's round each average to 3 decimal places? We'll do:\n\n   hour0: 5.16275 -> 5.163\n   hour1: 4.782 -> 4.782\n   ... \n\n But note that 4.782 is already 3 decimals.\n\n We'll compute each average and round to 3 decimals.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the exact average without rounding? The input had 3 decimals, so we output 3 decimals.\n\n We'll round to 3 decimals.\n\n Let me recalc and round:\n\n   hour0: 5.16275 -> 5.163\n   hour1: 4.782 -> 4.782\n   hour2: 4.485 -> 4.485\n   hour3: 4.211 -> 4.211\n   hour4: 3.8605 -> 3.860 (if we round half to even: 3.8605 -> 3.860? but 0.5 is exactly in the middle -> 3.8605 * 1000 = 3860.5 -> round to even: 3860 -> 3.860? \n        Actually, 3.8605 rounded to 3 decimals: look at the 4th decimal is 5, so we round up the 3rd decimal: 3.861? \n        But note: 3.8605: the third decimal is 0, the next is 5 -> round up the 0 to 1 -> 3.861.\n\n        Let me check: \n          3.8605: \n            thousandths place: 0, next digit is 5 -> round up the 0 to 1 -> 3.861.\n\n        Similarly, hour4: 3.8605 -> 3.861\n\n   hour5: 3.83775 -> 3.838 (because 3.83775: thousandths is 7, next is 7 -> round up 7 to 8? but wait: \n        3.83775: \n          thousandths: 7, then hundred-thousandths: 7 -> but we are rounding to 3 decimals: \n          look at the 4th decimal: 7 -> which is >=5, so round up the 3rd decimal: 7 becomes 8 -> 3.838\n\n   hour6: 4.036 -> 4.036\n   hour7: 3.89875 -> 3.899 (because 3.89875: 4th decimal is 7 -> round up the 8 to 9? but wait: \n        3.89875: \n          thousandths: 8, next is 7 -> round up: 8 becomes 9 -> 3.899)\n\n   hour8: 3.3885 -> 3.389 (because 3.3885: 4th decimal is 5 -> round up the 8 to 9 -> 3.389)\n\n   hour9: 3.541 -> 3.541?

So the next 4 days are within the same month.\n\n  We must output 96 rows.\n\n  Let's code the generation:\n\n      base_date = datetime(2016, 8, 22)\n      for day in range(4):\n          for hour in range(24):\n              date = base_date + timedelta(days=day, hours=hour)\n              value = the rounded average for that hour\n\n  We'll format the date as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n  But note: the input had the date string without space? Actually, the input had a space: \"2016-08-18 00:00:00\"\n\n  We'll output in the same format.\n\n  We have the list of hourly averages (24 values) in the order of hour0 to hour23.\n\n  Let me list the averages again (rounded to 3 decimals) for each hour:\n\n      hour0: 5.163\n      hour1: 4.782\n      hour2: 4.485\n      hour3: 4.211\n      hour4: 3.861\n      hour5: 3.838\n      hour6: 4.036\n      hour7: 3.899\n      hour8: 3.389\n      hour9: 3.541\n      hour10: 4.508\n      hour11: 4.752\n      hour12: 4.660\n      hour13: 4.858\n      hour14: 4.554\n      hour15: 4.272\n      hour16: 4.013\n      hour17: 4.409\n      hour18: 3.792\n      hour19: 4.302\n      hour20: 5.947\n      hour21: 5.841\n      hour22: 5.079\n      hour23: 4.622\n\n  Now, we output 4 days of these 24 values.\n\n  We'll write the answer in the required format.\n\n  Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data.
