        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2017-09-10 00:00:00 to 2017-09-13 23:00:00) for the \"Low UseFul Load\" (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (i.e., 4 days) of LUFL data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has an hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead.\n 2. The data may have missing values, but in the provided 96 points, we don't see any missing (all 24 hours for 4 days: 4*24=96). \n    However, we are warned that the data might have missing values. Since the provided data is complete, we can proceed without imputation for the historical part.\n 3. We must generate 96 future data points (from 2017-09-14 00:00:00 to 2017-09-17 23:00:00).\n\n Approach:\n Given the complexity and the need for a forecast, we can use a time series model. Since we are in a simulated environment and cannot run actual code, \n we will use a simple forecasting method that captures the daily seasonality and recent trends.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - There is a clear daily pattern (lower at night, higher during the day).\n   - The values range between about 1.8 and 3.4.\n\n We can use a seasonal naive method or a more advanced method. However, we are limited by the text interface.\n\n Since we are to provide a complete set of 96 numbers, we can do:\n\n   Option 1: Use the last available season (last 24 hours) as the forecast for the next 24 hours, and repeat for 4 days (96 hours). \n        But note: the pattern might change slightly.\n\n   Option 2: Compute the average of each hour over the 4 available days and then use that average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Group by hour of the day (00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00) and take the mean of the 4 days.\n\n   However, note that the data might have a trend or other patterns. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (2017-09-13) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous days? \n\n   But the problem says the data might have missing values, but in the provided data there are none. So we can compute the hourly average.\n\n   Steps for averaging:\n\n        hour00: [2.528, 1.980, 2.376, 2.406] -> average = (2.528+1.980+2.376+2.406)/4 = 2.3225\n        hour01: [2.345, 2.071, 2.071, 1.888] -> average = (2.345+2.071+2.071+1.888)/4 = 2.09375\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then we use this average pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n   However, note that the last day (2017-09-13) might be more representative? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most recent day has a higher weight? But without more data, we stick to simple average.\n\n   But note: the data shows some variation. For example, the hour 00:00 on the first day was 2.528 and on the last day 2.406, which is a decrease.\n\n   We might also consider a linear trend for each hour? But that would require more days to be reliable.\n\n   Given the simplicity, we'll use the average of the 4 days for each hour.\n\n   However, let's check: the data for the same hour across days does not show a clear trend. So averaging is acceptable.\n\n   We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then assign:\n\n        Day 1 (2017-09-14): [avg00, avg01, ... avg23]\n        Day 2 (2017-09-15): same as above\n        Day 3 (2017-09-16): same\n        Day 4 (2017-09-17): same\n\n But note: the problem says the data might have missing values. We are not told about the future, so we assume we are to provide a complete forecast.\n\n However, if we are to be more sophisticated, we could use an exponential smoothing state space model (like Holt-Winters) to capture seasonality and trend. \n But without running code, we have to do it manually.\n\n Given the constraints, we choose the averaging method.\n\n Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   hour00: (2.528 + 1.980 + 2.376 + 2.406) / 4 = 2.3225\n   hour01: (2.345 + 2.071 + 2.071 + 1.888) / 4 = (2.345+2.071=4.416; 4.416+2.071=6.487; 6.487+1.888=8.375) -> 8.375/4 = 2.09375\n   hour02: (1.949+2.858? Wait, let me list:\n\n        Day1: 02:00 -> 1.949\n        Day2: 02:00 -> 2.315\n        Day3: 02:00 -> 1.858\n        Day4: 02:00 -> 1.980\n\n        Actually, the data for day2 at 02:00 is 2.315? Let me check:\n\n        2017-09-10 02:00:00 1.949\n        2017-09-11 02:00:00 2.315\n        2017-09-12 02:00:00 1.858\n        2017-09-13 02:00:00 1.980\n\n        So: (1.949 + 2.315 + 1.858 + 1.980) / 4 = (1.949+2.315=4.264; 4.264+1.858=6.122; 6.122+1.980=8.102) -> 8.102/4 = 2.0255\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a small table. But since we are to provide 96 numbers, we must compute 24 averages and then repeat them 4 times.\n\n   Let me compute the averages for each hour:\n\n        hour00: [2.528, 1.980, 2.376, 2.406] -> 2.3225\n        hour01: [2.345, 2.071, 2.071, 1.888] -> 2.09375\n        hour02: [1.949, 2.315, 1.858, 1.980] -> (1.949+2.315+1.858+1.980)/4 = 8.102/4 = 2.0255\n        hour03: [1.858, 2.284, 2.102, 2.071] -> (1.858+2.284+2.102+2.071)/4 = 8.315/4 = 2.07875\n        hour04: [1.919, 2.102, 2.102, 2.284] -> (1.919+2.102+2.102+2.284)/4 = 8.407/4 = 2.10175\n        hour05: [2.224, 2.315, 2.559, 2.528] -> (2.224+2.315+2.559+2.528)/4 = 9.626/4 = 2.4065\n        hour06: [2.955, 2.741, 3.137, 3.320] -> (2.955+2.741+3.137+3.320)/4 = 12.153/4 = 3.03825\n        hour07: [2.589, 2.894, 2.589, 2.985] -> (2.589+2.894+2.589+2.985)/4 = 11.057/4 = 2.76425\n        hour08: [2.772, 2.741, 2.863, 3.381] -> (2.772+2.741+2.863+3.381)/4 = 11.757/4 = 2.93925\n        hour09: [2.833, 2.711, 2.619, 2.680] -> (2.833+2.711+2.619+2.680)/4 = 10.843/4 = 2.71075\n        hour10: [3.015, 3.015, 2.924, 2.741] -> (3.015+3.015+2.924+2.741)/4 = 11.695/4 = 2.92375\n        hour11: [3.137, 3.076, 3.320, 2.924] -> (3.137+3.076+3.320+2.924)/4 = 12.457/4 = 3.11425\n        hour12: [2.528, 2.345, 2.406, 2.284] -> (2.528+2.345+2.406+2.284)/4 = 9.563/4 = 2.39075\n        hour13: [2.528, 2.071, 2.559, 2.163] -> (2.528+2.071+2.559+2.163)/4 = 9.321/4 = 2.33025\n        hour14: [2.619, 2.102, 2.345, 2.102] -> (2.619+2.102+2.345+2.102)/4 = 9.168/4 = 2.292\n        hour15: [2.589, 1.888, 2.345, 2.376] -> (2.589+1.888+2.345+2.376)/4 = 9.198/4 = 2.2995\n        hour16: [2.619, 2.041, 2.345, 2.376] -> (2.619+2.041+2.345+2.376)/4 = 9.381/4 = 2.34525\n        hour17: [2.833, 2.559, 2.985, 2.741] -> (2.833+2.559+2.985+2.741)/4 = 11.118/4 = 2.7795\n        hour18: [2.559, 2.193, 2.955, 2.619] -> (2.559+2.193+2.955+2.619)/4 = 10.326/4 = 2.5815\n        hour19: [2.863, 3.046, 2.680, 2.741] -> (2.863+3.046+2.680+2.741)/4 = 11.33/4 = 2.8325\n        hour20: [2.955, 2.802, 3.076, 2.619] -> (2.955+2.802+3.076+2.619)/4 = 11.452/4 = 2.863\n        hour21: [2.680, 2.345, 2.772, 2.833] -> (2.680+2.345+2.772+2.833)/4 = 10.63/4 = 2.6575\n        hour22: [2.376, 2.894, 2.376, 2.315] -> (2.376+2.894+2.376+2.315)/4 = 9.961/4 = 2.49025\n        hour23: [2.071, 2.345, 2.345, 2.284] -> (2.071+2.345+2.345+2.284)/4 = 9.045/4 = 2.26125\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        Day1: 2017-09-14 00:00:00 -> 2.3225\n               2017-09-14 01:00:00 -> 2.09375\n               ... until 23:00:00 -> 2.26125\n\n        Day2: 2017-09-15 00:00:00 -> 2.3225\n               ... same as above\n\n        Day3: same\n        Day4: same\n\n   However, note: the dates must be generated as:\n\n        Start: 2017-09-14 00:00:00 (next after 2017-09-13 23:00:00)\n        Then 2017-09-14 01:00:00 ... up to 2017-09-17 23:00:00.\n\n   We have 4 days * 24 hours = 96.\n\n   We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n   But note: the original data has 4 days (from 10th to 13th) and we are forecasting the next 4 days (14th to 17th).\n\n   Format: the same as the input: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        2017-09-14 00:00:00 <value>\n        2017-09-14 01:00:00 <value>\n        ...\n\n   We'll round the numbers to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, note: the input has 3 decimal places.
