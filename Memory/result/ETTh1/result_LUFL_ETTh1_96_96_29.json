        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (4 days * 24 hours) for the Low Useful Load (LUFL) of a transformer.\n The data has some missing values? But in the provided data, there are 96 consecutive points without any explicit missing value (like NaN). \n However, the problem states that the data will have missing values, so we must be cautious. In the provided data, we don't see any missing value in the given 96 points.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data is hourly and we are to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days).\n 2. We must handle the possibility of missing values in the provided data? But the given 96 points are complete. \n    However, the problem says \"these data will have missing values\", so we should impute if necessary. But in the provided data, there are no missing values.\n\n 3. We are to forecast the next 96 points. We can use a time series model that can handle hourly data and capture daily seasonality (since 24 hours in a day).\n\n 4. Since the data is relatively short (only 96 points) and we are to forecast 96 points, we can use models like:\n    - SARIMA (with seasonal period 24)\n    - Exponential Smoothing (with seasonality)\n    - Or a simple approach: using the average of the same hour in the past 4 days? But note: we have exactly 4 days.\n\n 5. However, looking at the data, we see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. For example, the first day (2016-10-25) and the next days have different levels.\n\n 6. We are going to use a model that can handle seasonality and trend. Given the short history, we can try to fit a seasonal model.\n\n 7. We note that the data has a daily pattern: low during night, higher during the day.\n\n 8. We can use a simple method: take the last day (day 4) and use it as a base, but adjust by the trend? \n    However, without a clear trend and only 4 days, it's hard to determine a trend.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the average of the four days for each hour? But note: the first day (2016-10-25) has lower values than the next days.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the average of the last two or three days? \n\n 11. Since the problem says there might be missing values, we should first check the provided data for missingness. \n     The provided data has 96 consecutive hours without any gap. So we can proceed.\n\n 12. We decide to use a simple average of the four days for each hour to forecast the next four days? \n     But note: the data for the same hour in the four days:\n\n     Example for hour 00:00: \n        Day1: 1.340\n        Day2: 3.929\n        Day3: 2.010\n        Day4: 1.523\n\n     The average = (1.340 + 3.929 + 2.010 + 1.523) / 4 = 2.2005\n\n     Then we would use 2.2005 for the next day at 00:00? and similarly for other hours.\n\n 13. But we see that the values on day2 (2016-10-26) are significantly higher. This might be an anomaly? \n     We might consider using the median to avoid the effect of that one high day? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing state space model (ETS) or an ARIMA model. However, with only 96 points and 24 seasonality, \n     the SARIMA model might be too many parameters.\n\n 15. Given the constraints, we choose a simple method: \n      - For each hour (0 to 23) in the day, we take the median of the four available values for that hour to form a typical day.\n      - Then we forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating this typical day 4 times.\n\n 16. Why median? Because the second day (2016-10-26) is an outlier in terms of magnitude. The median will be less affected by that one day.\n\n 17. Steps for median method:\n      - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23). We have 4 values for each hour (from 4 days).\n      - For each hour, compute the median of the 4 values.\n      - Then for the next 4 days (starting from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00), we assign the median value for the corresponding hour.\n\n 18. How to handle the date? \n      - The last date in the given data is 2016-10-28 23:00:00.\n      - The next 96 hours would be from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00.\n\n 19.

Now, we create the next 96 hours (4 days) by repeating the above median values for each hour, for 4 days.\n\n 21. The starting date and time for the forecast is: \n        Day1: 2016-10-29 00:00:00 to 2016-10-29 23:00:00\n        Day2: 2016-10-30 00:00:00 to 2016-10-30 23:00:00\n        Day3: 2016-10-31 00:00:00 to 2016-10-31 23:00:00\n        Day4: 2016-11-01 00:00:00 to 2016-11-01 23:00:00\n\n 22. We output the data in the same format: two columns (date and LUFL) for 96 rows.\n\n 23. We note: the median method is robust to outliers and we have used the entire 4 days to form a typical day.\n\n 24. However, we must note that the median method does not capture any trend. But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n 25. We output the data in the required format.\n\n 26. Let's generate the dates: \n        Start: 2016-10-29 00:00:00\n        Then we add 1 hour until we have 96 records.\n\n 27. The LUFL values for each day will be the same: the median for each hour.\n\n 28. We write the data in the format:\n\n        2016-10-29 00:00:00 <median_hour0>\n        2016-10-29 01:00:00 <median_hour1>\n        ...\n        2016-10-29 23:00:00 <median_hour23>\n        2016-10-30 00:00:00 <median_hour0>\n        ... and so on.\n\n 29. We use the LUFL values as computed above.\n\n 30. We round the LUFL values to 3 decimal places as in the input.\n\n 31. However, note: the input data had 3 decimal places. We will round the medians to 3 decimal places.\n\n 32. Let's recalculate the medians and round:\n\n      Hour0: 1.7665 -> 1.767\n      Hour1: 1.5535 -> 1.554\n      Hour2: 1.477 -> 1.477\n      Hour3: 1.4925 -> 1.493\n      Hour4: 1.462 -> 1.462\n      Hour5: 1.7055 -> 1.706\n      Hour6: 2.1015 -> 2.102\n      Hour7: 3.122 -> 3.122\n      Hour8: 2.787 -> 2.787\n      Hour9: 2.5585 -> 2.559\n      Hour10: 2.894 -> 2.894\n      Hour11: 3.3505 -> 3.351\n      Hour12: 2.589 -> 2.589\n      Hour13: 2.4675 -> 2.468\n      Hour14: 2.467 -> 2.467\n      Hour15: 2.4675 -> 2.468\n      Hour16: 2.726 -> 2.726\n      Hour17: 3.168 -> 3.168\n      Hour18: 2.848 -> 2.848\n      Hour19: 2.482 -> 2.482\n      Hour20: 2.193 -> 2.193\n      Hour21: 1.9645 -> 1.965\n      Hour22: 1.6145 -> 1.615\n      Hour23: 1.614 -> 1.614\n\n 33. Now, note: the median for hour23 was 1.614, so we keep it.\n\n 34. We generate the next 96 points accordingly.\n\n 35. We output in the required format.\n\n 36. We note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\" and the format.\n\n 37. We write the answer in the following format:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-10-29 00:00:00 1.767\n2016-10-29 01:00:00 1.554\n2016-10-29 02:00:00 1.477\n2016-10-29 03:00:00 1.493\n2016-10-29 04:00:00 1.462\n2016-10-29 05:00:00 1.706\n2016-10-29 06:00:00 2.102\n2016-10-29 07:00:00 3.122\n2016-10-29 08:00:00 2.787\n2016-10-29 09:00:00 2.559\n2016-10-29 10:00:00 2.894\n2016-10-29 11:00:00 3.351\n2016-10-29 12:00:00 2.589\n2016-10-29 13:00:00 2.468\n2016-10-29 14:00:00 2.467\n2016-10-29 15:00:00 2.468\n2016-10-29 16:00:00 2.726\n2016-10-29 17:00:00 3.168\n2016-10-29 18:00:00 2.848\n2016-10-29 19:00:00 2.482\n2016-10-29 20:00:00 2.193\n2016-10-29 21:00:00 1.965\n2016-10-29 22:00:00 1.615\n2016-10-29 23:00:00 1.614\n2016-10-30 00:00:00 1.767\n2016-10-30 01:00:00 1.554\n... and so on for 4 days.\n\n 38. We generate 4 days of 24 hours each, total 96 records.\n\n 39. We write the code to generate the dates and the corresponding LUFL value.\n\n 40. We note: the date format is \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 41. We start from 2016-10-29 00:00:00 and then add one hour at a time.\n\n 42. We use the same LUFL pattern for each day.\n\n 43. We output the entire 96 records.\n\n 44. We note: the last date in the provided data is 2016-10-28 23:00:00, so the next hour is 2016-10-29 00:00:00.\n\n 45. We write the answer accordingly.\n",
