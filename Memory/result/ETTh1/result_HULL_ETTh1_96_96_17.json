        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points for the \"High UseLess Load\" (HULL) from 2016-09-07 00:00:00 to 2016-09-10 23:00:00.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of HULL values.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the data has missing values? The provided data does not have missing values in the given 96 points, but we are warned that the data might have missing values. However, the provided sample is complete.\n\n 2. We must forecast 96 steps ahead. Since the data is hourly, we are forecasting the next 96 hours.\n\n 3. We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the relatively short history (only 4 days) and the hourly seasonality (likely 24-hour pattern), we can consider models like:\n    - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) with seasonality of 24 hours.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows a daily pattern (e.g., values at night are lower, and peaks during the day? but the pattern is not very clear from the given 4 days).\n\n 5. Given the complexity and the need for automation, we can use an automated model like AutoARIMA or a simple seasonal naive forecast.\n\n 6. But note: the data has 96 points (4 days * 24 hours). We can try to fit a model and forecast.\n\n 7. However, the problem says the data may have missing values. In the provided data, there are no missing values, so we can proceed.\n\n 8. Since we are to provide the complete data for the next 96 dates, we must generate the timestamps as well.\n\n 9. The last timestamp in the data is: 2016-09-10 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2016-09-11 00:00:00 to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n 10. We must output the data in the same format: two columns (date and HULL) and 96 rows.\n\n 11. Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex model fitting. Therefore, we will use a simple method: \n     - We observe that the data has a daily pattern. We can use the average of each hour over the available 4 days to forecast the next 4 days.\n\n 12. How to handle if there are missing values? We are told to be aware of missing values, but the provided data is complete. For forecasting, we assume the pattern is consistent.\n\n 13. Steps for a simple average model:\n      a. Group the data by hour of the day (so we have 24 groups: 00, 01, ... 23).\n      b. For each hour, compute the average HULL over the 4 days.\n      c. Then, for the next 96 hours (which are 4 days), we use the average for hour 00, then 01, ... 23, and repeat for 4 days.\n\n 14. But note: the data does not show a clear consistent pattern? Let's check:\n\n      For example, hour 00: \n        2016-09-07: 4.019\n        2016-09-08: 5.090\n        2016-09-09: 6.430\n        2016-09-10: 5.492\n        Average = (4.019+5.090+6.430+5.492)/4 = 5.25775\n\n      Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n 15. However, the data on 2016-09-09 has an anomaly? At 05:00: 3.751 and 06:00: 3.483, which are lower than surrounding hours? But we are taking the average.\n\n 16. This method is simple and handles the seasonality.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we could use the last available day (2016-09-10) and repeat it 4 times? But that would ignore the trend and variations.\n\n 18. Given the very short history (only 4 days) and the need for a forecast, the average by hour is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 19. We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours and then replicate that pattern for the next 4 days.\n\n 20. How to compute the average for each hour:\n\n      We have 4 days, so for hour h (h from 0 to 23), we have 4 values: \n        day1_h, day2_h, day3_h, day4_h.\n\n      Then, average_h = (day1_h + day2_h + day3_h + day4_h) / 4\n\n 21. Then the forecast for:\n        day5: [average_00, average_01, ... average_23]\n        day6: same as day5\n        day7: same\n        day8: same\n\n 22. But note: the last day in the data is 2016-09-10 (day4). Then the next 4 days are:\n        2016-09-11, 2016-09-12, 2016-09-13, 2016-09-14.\n\n 23. We generate the timestamps accordingly.\n\n 24. However, we must be cautious: the data might have a trend? But with only 4 days, it's hard to capture a trend. We ignore the trend for simplicity.\n\n 25. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 4 values we have.\n\n 26. But note: the data provided is exactly 96 points (4*24). We can reshape the HULL values into a 4x24 matrix.\n\n 27. Example for hour 0 (index0): \n        day0: 4.019 (2016-09-07 00:00:00)\n        day1: 5.090 (2016-09-08 00:00:00)\n        day2: 6.430 (2016-09-09 00:00:00)\n        day3: 5.492 (2016-09-10 00:00:00)\n        average = (4.019+5.090+6.430+5.492)/4 = 5.25775\n\n 28. Similarly, for hour 1 (index1):\n        day0: 4.354\n        day1: 4.756\n        day2: 6.765\n        day3: 5.626\n        average = (4.354+4.756+6.765+5.626)/4 = 5.37525\n\n 29. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 30. Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is the same 24 averages repeated 4 times.\n\n 31. We generate the dates:\n\n        Start: 2016-09-11 00:00:00 (the next hour after 2016-09-10 23:00:00)\n        Then 2016-09-11 01:00:00, ... up to 2016-09-14 23:00:00.\n\n 32. We'll create a list of dates using pandas date_range or manually.\n\n 33. Format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 34. We output the data in the same way as the input: two columns, first the date string, then the HULL value (rounded to 3 decimal places? as in the input).\n\n 35. Since the input has 3 decimal places, we round the averages to 3 decimal places.\n\n 36. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n      We'll extract the HULL values and reshape:\n\n        data = [4.019, 4.354, 4.555, ...]  (96 values)\n\n        We can split into 4 chunks of 24.\n\n 37. Code for averaging (pseudocode):\n\n        hourly_sums = [0.0]*24\n        for day in range(4):\n            for hour in range(24):\n                index = day*24 + hour\n                hourly_sums[hour] += data[index]\n\n        hourly_avg = [round(hourly_sums[i]/4, 3) for i in range(24)]\n\n 38. Then the forecast for the next 96 hours is: [hourly_avg[0], hourly_avg[1], ... hourly_avg[23], then repeat 3 more times]\n\n 39. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n        start_date = '2016-09-10 23:00:00' is the last point. The next point is '2016-09-11 00:00:00'\n\n        We can generate 96 timestamps at hourly frequency starting from '2016-09-11 00:00:00'\n\n 40. We'll write the output in the required format.\n\n 41. However, note: the data provided ends at 2016-09-10 23:00:00, so the next 96 hours are:\n\n        '2016-09-11 00:00:00'\n        '2016-09-11 01:00:00'\n        ...\n        '2016-09-14 23:00:00'\n\n 42. We'll compute the hourly averages and then create the forecast.\n\n 43. Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n        We have the 96 points. We break into 4 days (each 24 hours).\n\n        Day0: indices 0-23: 2016-09-07\n        Day1: indices 24-47: 2016-09-08\n        Day2: indices 48-71: 2016-09-09\n        Day3: indices 72-95: 2016-09-10\n\n        We'll create an array for each hour.\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): \n            values = [4.019, 5.090, 6.430, 5.492] -> average = (4.019+5.090+6.430+5.492)/4 = 5.25775 -> 5.258\n        For hour 1 (01:00):\n            values = [4.354, 4.756, 6.765, 5.626] -> (4.354+4.756+6.765+5.626)/4 = 5.37525 -> 5.375\n        For hour 2 (02:00):\n            values = [4.555, 5.358, 7.100, 5.224] -> (4.555+5.358+7.100+5.224)/4 = 5.55925 -> 5.559\n        For hour 3 (03:00):\n            values = [3.684, 5.090, 6.497, 4.957] -> (3.684+5.090+6.497+4.957)/4 = 5.057 -> 5.057\n        For hour 4 (04:00):\n            values = [4.019, 5.291, 6.564, 4.622] -> (4.019+5.291+6.564+4.622)/4 = 5.124 -> 5.124\n        For hour 5 (05:00):\n            values = [4.488, 5.224, 3.751, 5.157] -> (4.488+5.224+3.751+5.157)/4 = 4.655 -> 4.655\n        For hour 6 (06:00):\n            values = [5.090, 5.827, 3.483, 5.023] -> (5.090+5.827+3.483+5.023)/4 = 4.85575 -> 4.856\n        For hour 7 (07:00):\n            values = [5.827, 5.224, 3.215, 5.425] -> (5.827+5.224+3.215+5.425)/4 = 4.92275 -> 4.923\n        For hour 8 (08:00):\n            values = [5.358, 4.354, 4.622, 5.961] -> (5.358+4.354+4.622+5.961)/4 = 5.07375 -> 5.074\n        For hour 9 (09:00):\n            values = [5.157, 4.823, 3.014, 5.559] -> (5.157+4.823+3.014+5.559)/4 = 4.63825 -> 4.638\n        For hour 10 (10:00):\n            values = [5.425, 4.957, 5.023, 5.894] -> (5.425+4.957+5.023+5.894)/4 = 5.32475 -> 5.325\n        For hour 11 (11:00):\n            values = [4.220, 4.756, 5.023, 5.492] -> (4.220+4.756+5.023+5.492)/4 = 4.87275 -> 4.873\n        For hour 12 (12:00):\n            values = [3.617, 3.617, 3.349, 4.019] -> (3.617+3.617+3.349+4.019)/4 = 3.6505 -> 3.651\n        For hour 13 (13:00):\n            values = [3.550, 3.751, 3.952, 4.086] -> (3.550+3.751+3.952+4.086)/4 = 3.83475 -> 3.835\n        For hour 14 (14:00):\n            values = [3.952, 3.952, 4.823, 3.818] -> (3.952+3.952+4.823+3.818)/4 = 4.13625 -> 4.136\n        For hour 15 (15:00):\n            values = [3.617, 3.952, 5.224, 4.689] -> (3.617+3.952+5.224+4.689)/4 = 4.3705 -> 4.371\n        For hour 16 (16:00):\n            values = [3.818, 3.751, 4.287, 4.086] -> (3.818+3.751+4.287+4.086)/4 = 3.9855 -> 3.986\n        For hour 17 (17:00):\n            values = [3.684, 3.885, 4.153, 4.354] -> (3.684+3.885+4.153+4.354)/4 = 4.019 -> 4.019\n        For hour 18 (18:00):\n            values = [3.349, 3.282, 3.550, 3.751] -> (3.349+3.282+3.550+3.751)/4 = 3.483 -> 3.483\n        For hour 19 (19:00):\n            values = [2.746, 3.282, 3.617, 3.684] -> (2.746+3.282+3.617+3.684)/4 = 3.33225 -> 3.332\n        For hour 20 (20:00):\n            values = [3.014, 3.416, 3.416, 3.349] -> (3.014+3.416+3.416+3.349)/4 = 3.29875 -> 3.299\n        For hour 21 (21:00):\n            values = [3.215, 3.349, 2.947, 3.617] -> (3.215+3.349+2.947+3.617)/4 = 3.282 -> 3.282\n        For hour 22 (22:00):\n            values = [3.215, 5.090, 4.622, 4.957] -> (3.215+5.090+4.622+4.957)/4 = 4.471 -> 4.471\n        For hour 23 (23:00):\n            values = [4.086, 5.559, 4.957, 3.885] -> (4.086+5.559+4.957+3.885)/4 = 4.62175 -> 4.622\n\n 44. Now, the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is the above 24 values repeated 4 times.\n\n 45.

But we are writing in a programming environment? We are to output text.\n\n 53.

We have the list `hourly_avg` of 24 values.\n\n 55. We'll generate the date strings in the format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n\n 56. Start date: 2016-09-11 00:00:00\n\n 57.

However, note: the input had the date string exactly as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", with two-digit for day, month, hour, minute, second.\n\n 61. We'll generate the dates = []\n        start = datetime(2016, 11, 9) -> wait, no: the last date was 2016-09-10, so next is 2016-09-11.\n\n        Actually: 2016-09-10 23:00:00 -> next hour is 2016-09-11 00:00:00.\n\n        We'll use: \n            from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n        But we are not in a Python environment?

So we can write without zfill for day? but we do: \n            \"2016-09-11\", \"2016-09-12\", etc.\n\n        However, we must have two-digit day: so for day=11 -> \"11\", day=12 -> \"12\", etc. They are two-digit.\n\n        For hour: we need two-digit: so 0 -> \"00\", 1->\"01\", ... 23->\"23\"\n\n 63. We'll do:\n\n        days = [11,12,13,14]\n        for day in days:\n            for hour in range(24):\n                date_str = f\"2016-09-{day:02d} {hour:02d}:00:00\"\n\n        But note: the input had the day as two-digit: e.g., \"07\", \"08\", so we use two-digit.\n\n 64. However, the input had the day as two-digit: so we use two-digit for day and hour.\n\n 65. We have the forecast values: a list of 24 numbers (the averages) and we repeat them 4 days.\n\n 66. We'll create the list of forecast values: \n        forecast = hourly_avg * 4   (which repeats the list 4 times)\n\n 67. Then we pair with the dates.\n\n 68. Now, we write the output.\n\n 69. We must output exactly 96 lines.\n\n 70. We'll write:\n\n        <answer>\n        \n```\n2016-09-11 00:00:00 5.258\n2016-09-11 01:00:00 5.375\n2016-09-11 02:00:00 5.559\n... (96 lines)\n\n 71. We note: the input had a space between the date and the value? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2016-09-07 00:00:00 4.019\"\n\n        So we use a space.\n\n 72. We output the value rounded to 3 decimal places as we computed.\n\n 73. Let's write the complete output.\n\n 74. We have computed the hourly averages above. We'll use the rounded values we calculated.\n\n 75. The list of hourly averages (24 values) is:\n\n        [5.258, 5.375, 5.559, 5.057, 5.124, 4.655, 4.856, 4.923, 5.074, 4.638, 5.325, 4.873, 3.651, 3.835, 4.136, 4.371, 3.986, 4.019, 3.483, 3.332, 3.299, 3.282, 4.471, 4.622]\n\n 76. Now, we generate the dates:\n\n        Day 11: 2016-09-11\n        Day 12: 2016-09-12\n        Day 13: 2016-09-13\n        Day 14: 2016-09-14\n\n 77. We write the 96 lines.\n\n 78. We output in the required format.\n\n 79. Note: The problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n 80. We output the entire 96 lines.\n\n 81.
