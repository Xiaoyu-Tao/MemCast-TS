        "reasoning": "We are given 96 hourly data points (from 2016-09-15 00:00:00 to 2016-09-18 23:00:00) for the \"LULL\" (Low UseLess Load) of a transformer.\n The task is to forecast the next 96 hours (4 days) of data.\n\n Since the data has hourly frequency and we are to forecast 96 steps ahead, we note that the data might have daily seasonality.\n\n However, note the data provided is only 4 days (96 hours). This is a very short history for training a model.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a simple method such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the last complete season (which is 24 hours) to forecast the next 96 hours by repeating the last day (2016-09-18) 4 times.\n\n But note: the data ends at 2016-09-18 23:00:00. The next 96 hours would be from 2016-09-19 00:00:00 to 2016-09-22 23:00:00.\n\n However, let's check the pattern:\n\n The data for 2016-09-15 to 2016-09-18:\n\n  2016-09-15: [1.249, 1.340, 1.401, 1.310, 1.401, 1.401, 1.401, 1.432, 0.914, 0.883, 0.761, 0.640, 0.548, 0.640, 0.670, 0.670, 0.670, 0.609, 0.609, 0.609, 0.670, 0.640, 0.701, 0.761]\n  2016-09-16: [0.640, 0.609, 0.548, 0.487, 0.518, 0.518, 0.670, 0.701, 0.853, 1.005, 0.853, 1.005, 0.944, 0.761, 0.822, 0.792, 0.822, 0.792, 0.701, 0.640, 0.701, 0.731, 0.640, 0.640]\n  2016-09-17: [0.579, 0.609, 0.640, 0.640, 0.731, 0.853, 0.822, 1.005, 0.944, 1.066, 1.066, 0.944, 1.036, 1.066, 1.066, 1.066, 1.157, 0.944, 0.822, 0.731, 0.792, 0.853, 0.670, 0.853]\n  2016-09-18: [1.401, 1.462, 1.614, 1.492, 1.523, 1.523, 1.675, 1.767, 1.279, 1.127, 1.005, 0.914, 0.822, 0.853, 0.914, 1.005, 0.975, 0.822, 0.822, 0.701, 0.792, 0.701, 0.792, 0.883]\n\n We can see that the pattern is not exactly repeating. However, without more data, we have to make a simple forecast.\n\n Approach:\n   Since the data is very short, we can use the last day (2016-09-18) as the pattern for the next 4 days? But note the problem says \"Low UseLess Load\", and we see that the values on 2016-09-18 are generally higher than the previous days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can take the average of the four days for each hour and then use that as the daily pattern, then repeat it 4 times.\n\n   However, note that the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have 4 days, which is less than a week.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, and the requirement to provide 96 values, we choose:\n\n   Option 1: Use the last day (2016-09-18) and repeat it 4 times.\n\n   But the problem says there are missing values? In the provided data, there are 96 consecutive hours without missing values. So we assume the next 96 might have the same pattern.\n\n   However, note that the data starts at 2016-09-15 which is a Thursday and ends at 2016-09-18 (Sunday). The next 4 days would be Monday to Thursday? But we don't have Monday data in the history.\n\n   Given the lack of data, we will use the average of the available 4 days for each hour of the day to form a daily profile, and then repeat that profile 4 days.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n   2. For each hour, compute the mean of the 4 days.\n   3. Then for the next 96 hours (4 days), we repeat this daily profile 4 times.\n\n   Why average? Because it smooths out any day-to-day variations and we have only 4 days.\n\n   However, note that the last day (2016-09-18) is a Sunday and the next 4 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. We don't have Monday-Thursday in the history? Actually, we have Thursday (2016-09-15) and Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So the next Monday would be a new day.\n\n   But without more data, we have to use the available 4 days to form a typical day.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   Hour 0: (1.249 + 0.640 + 0.579 + 1.401) / 4 = (1.249+0.640+0.579+1.401)/4 = 3.869/4 = 0.96725\n   Hour 1: (1.340 + 0.609 + 0.609 + 1.462) / 4 = (1.340+0.609+0.609+1.462)/4.02? Let me calculate: 1.340+0.609=1.949, +0.609=2.558, +1.462=4.02 -> 4.02/4=1.005\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Then we create 4 copies of these 24-hour averages.\n\n   But note: the problem says the data might have missing values? In the provided history there are none. We are to provide the next 96 without missing values.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? But mean is acceptable.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2016-09-18 is higher than the others? So the average might be pulled up by that day.\n\n   Since we are not given the context of what is \"next\" (if it's a weekday or weekend) and we have only one week of data (with Thursday to Sunday), we might be better off using the last day (Sunday) for the next week? But the next 4 days are Monday to Thursday? We don't have Monday-Thursday in the history.\n\n   Considering the trade-off, I think using the average of the 4 days is a safe approach.\n\n   Let's compute the hourly averages:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and then average.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a more robust method: since the data is short, we are forced to use a simple method.\n\n   We'll compute:\n\n   hour0_avg = (value_day1_0 + value_day2_0 + value_day3_0 + value_day4_0) / 4\n\n   and so on.\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 4 days (96 hours) is:\n\n        day1: [hour0_avg, hour1_avg, ... , hour23_avg]\n        day2: same as day1\n        day3: same as day1\n        day4: same as day1\n\n   But note: the problem says the data is for \"Low UseLess Load\", and we are forecasting 4 days. We don't have a trend in the data? The 4 days are not showing a clear trend? So we assume stationarity.\n\n   We'll compute the averages:\n\n   Hour 0: (1.249, 0.640, 0.579, 1.401) -> mean = (1.249+0.640+0.579+1.401)/4 = 3.869/4 = 0.96725\n   Hour 1: (1.340, 0.609, 0.609, 1.462) -> (1.340+0.609+0.609+1.462)=4.02 -> 1.005\n   Hour 2: (1.401, 0.548, 0.640, 1.614) -> (1.401+0.548+0.640+1.614)=4.203 -> 1.05075\n   Hour 3: (1.310, 0.487, 0.640, 1.492) -> (1.310+0.487+0.640+1.492)=3.929 -> 0.98225\n   Hour 4: (1.401, 0.518, 0.731, 1.523) -> (1.401+0.518+0.731+1.523)=4.173 -> 1.04325\n   Hour 5: (1.401, 0.518, 0.853, 1.523) -> (1.401+0.518+0.853+1.523)=4.295 -> 1.07375\n   Hour 6: (1.401, 0.670, 0.822, 1.675) -> (1.401+0.670+0.822+1.675)=4.568 -> 1.142\n   Hour 7: (1.432, 0.701, 1.005, 1.767) -> (1.432+0.701+1.005+1.767)=4.905 -> 1.22625\n   Hour 8: (0.914, 0.853, 0.944, 1.279) -> (0.914+0.853+0.944+1.279)=3.99 -> 0.9975\n   Hour 9: (0.883, 1.005, 1.066, 1.127) -> (0.883+1.005+1.066+1.127)=4.081 -> 1.02025\n   Hour10: (0.761, 0.853, 1.066, 1.005) -> (0.761+0.853+1.066+1.005)=3.685 -> 0.92125\n   Hour11: (0.640, 1.005, 0.944, 0.914) -> (0.640+1.005+0.944+0.914)=3.503 -> 0.87575\n   Hour12: (0.548, 0.944, 1.036, 0.822) -> (0.548+0.944+1.036+0.822)=3.35 -> 0.8375\n   Hour13: (0.640, 0.761, 1.066, 0.853) -> (0.640+0.761+1.066+0.853)=3.32 -> 0.83\n   Hour14: (0.670, 0.822, 1.066, 0.914) -> (0.670+0.822+1.066+0.914)=3.472 -> 0.868\n   Hour15: (0.670, 0.792, 1.066, 1.005) -> (0.670+0.792+1.066+1.005)=3.533 -> 0.88325\n   Hour16: (0.670, 0.822, 1.066, 0.975) -> (0.670+0.822+1.066+0.975)=3.533 -> 0.88325\n   Hour17: (0.609, 0.792, 1.157, 0.822) -> (0.609+0.792+1.157+0.822)=3.38 -> 0.845\n   Hour18: (0.609, 0.701, 0.944, 0.822) -> (0.609+0.701+0.944+0.822)=3.076 -> 0.769\n   Hour19: (0.609, 0.640, 0.731, 0.701) -> (0.609+0.640+0.731+0.701)=2.681 -> 0.67025\n   Hour20: (0.670, 0.701, 0.792, 0.792) -> (0.670+0.701+0.792+0.792)=2.955 -> 0.73875\n   Hour21: (0.640, 0.731, 0.853, 0.701) -> (0.640+0.731+0.853+0.701)=2.925 -> 0.73125\n   Hour22: (0.701, 0.640, 0.670, 0.792) -> (0.701+0.640+0.670+0.792)=2.803 -> 0.70075\n   Hour23: (0.761, 0.640, 0.853, 0.883) -> (0.761+0.640+0.853+0.883)=3.137 -> 0.78425\n\n   Then the forecast for the next 96 hours (starting at 2016-09-19 00:00:00) is:\n\n        Day1 (2016-09-19): [0.96725, 1.005, 1.05075, 0.98225, 1.04325, 1.07375, 1.142, 1.22625, 0.9975, 1.02025, 0.92125, 0.87575, 0.8375, 0.83, 0.868, 0.88325, 0.88325, 0.845, 0.769, 0.67025, 0.73875, 0.73125, 0.70075, 0.78425]\n        Day2 (2016-09-20): same as above\n        Day3 (2016-09-21): same as above\n        Day4 (2016-09-22): same as above\n\n   But note: the dates must be generated as well.\n\n   The last date in the input is 2016-09-18 23:00:00.

We have to output the data.\n\n   We'll generate:\n\n        date: starting at 2016-09-19 00:00:00, then 2016-09-19 01:00:00, ... until 2016-09-19 23:00:00, then 2016-09-20 00:00:00, ... until 2016-09-22 23:00:00.\n\n   And the LULL values: 4 repetitions of the daily profile.\n\n   Let's write the data:\n\n   We'll have 96 rows.\n\n   Example for the first day:\n\n        2016-09-19 00:00:00 0.967\n        2016-09-19 01:00:00 1.005\n        ... \n\n   We'll do this for 4 days.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"You must provide the complete data. You mustn't omit any content.\"\n\n   We'll output in the required format.\n\n   However, note: the problem says the data might have missing values?
