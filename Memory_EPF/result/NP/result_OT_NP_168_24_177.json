        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016/5/24 0:00 to 2016/5/30 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2016/5/31 0:00 to 2016/5/31 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we note that the data ends at 2016/5/30 23:00, so the next 24 hours are the entire day of 2016/5/31.\n\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we can use a time series method. Given the hourly data, we expect daily and weekly seasonality. However, without additional features (load forecast, wind power forecast) we rely on the historical price pattern.\n\n 3. We note that the data shows:\n    - Daily pattern: prices are lower at night and early morning, then rise during the day, peaking in the morning (around 8-9) and sometimes in the late afternoon/evening.\n    - Weekdays vs. weekends: Weekends (like 2016/5/28 and 2016/5/29) have lower prices.\n\n 4. The next day is 2016/5/31, which is a Tuesday (since 2016/5/30 is Monday). We can look at the same hour of previous days, especially the previous Tuesday (2016/5/24) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n 5. However, note that the data from 2016/5/30 (Monday) is available. We can use a simple approach: \n    - Use the average of the same hour of the last few weekdays (Monday to Friday) to capture the daily pattern, but adjust for the recent trend.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method: \n    - Since we have 7 days of data, we can take the average of the same hour of the last 7 days? But note that the pattern on weekends is different.\n\n 7. Considering the day of the week, we can use:\n    - The same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2016/5/30) as a base, but adjust with the difference between the previous Tuesday (2016/5/24) and the Monday before that (2016/5/23, which we don't have) so we can use the average of the last two weekdays.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and without additional data, a practical approach is to use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, we note that the price on 2016/5/30 (Monday) is available and we can use that as a base and adjust by the typical Tuesday pattern relative to Monday.\n\n 9. We can compute the average ratio (or difference) between Tuesday and Monday for the same hour from the previous week? But we only have one week of data.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n     - For each hour of the day (0 to 23) of the next day (2016/5/31), we take the average of that same hour from the last two weekdays (Monday and the previous Friday? but note that the weekend is in between). Actually, the last two weekdays we have are Monday (2016/5/30) and Friday (2016/5/27). But we also have the previous Tuesday (2016/5/24).\n\n 11. We can also consider a simple model: \n      Forecast = (Price of same hour on previous day) * (Average of the ratio of same hour on Tuesday to Monday for the previous week)\n\n 12. However, we only have one previous week. In the previous week:\n        Monday: 2016/5/23 (not provided, we start from 2016/5/24 which is Tuesday)\n        So we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n 13. Therefore, we can use the average of the same hour over the last three weekdays (Friday, Monday) and the previous Tuesday? But note that Friday and Monday are adjacent weekdays, and Tuesday is a week before.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two days (Monday and Sunday) and then adjust for the typical Tuesday increase? But Sunday is a weekend.\n\n 15. Given the data limitations, we can do:\n      - Use the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2016/5/30) and adjust by the average change from Monday to Tuesday in the same hour from the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week.\n\n 16. We can compute the average daily profile for weekdays and for weekends. Since 2016/5/31 is a weekday, we can take the average of the same hour for all the weekdays in the data: \n        Weekdays: 2016/5/24 (Tue), 2016/5/25 (Wed), 2016/5/26 (Thu), 2016/5/27 (Fri), 2016/5/30 (Mon) -> 5 days.\n\n 17. But note: the data starts on 2016/5/24 (Tuesday) and ends on 2016/5/30 (Monday). So we have:\n        Tuesday (5/24), Wednesday (5/25), Thursday (5/26), Friday (5/27), and Monday (5/30). \n\n 18. We can compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over these 5 weekdays.\n\n 19. However, this average would smooth out the daily variations and might not capture the recent trend (like the drop on Monday compared to Friday). \n\n 20. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and then adjust by the average change from Friday to the next Tuesday? But we don't have the next Tuesday in the data.\n\n 21. Given the above, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday 5/30 and Friday 5/27) and then adjust by the average change from the previous Tuesday (5/24) to the average of the Monday and Friday? This might be too complex.\n\n 22. Simpler: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday 5/30) and add a small adjustment based on the typical Tuesday pattern relative to Monday. Since we don't have a direct comparison, we can use the difference between the previous Tuesday (5/24) and the Monday of that week (which we don't have) so we skip.\n\n 23. We can also consider a weighted average, giving more weight to the most recent day (Monday) and then the Friday, and then the previous Tuesday? \n\n 24. Given the time and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we choose a simple method: \n        For each hour h in [0,23]:\n          forecast_h = (price of hour h on 2016/5/30) * (average of (price of hour h on 2016/5/24) / (price of hour h on 2016/5/23)) \n        But we don't have 2016/5/23.\n\n 25. Therefore, we use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays (5 days) for that hour. This will be our forecast.\n\n 26. Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        Let h be the hour (0 to 23).\n        Collect the prices for hour h from:\n            2016/5/24 (Tuesday)\n            2016/5/25 (Wednesday)\n            2016/5/26 (Thursday)\n            2016/5/27 (Friday)\n            2016/5/30 (Monday)\n        Compute the average: sum of these 5 values divided by 5.\n\n 27. However, note that 2016/5/30 is the most recent and might be more relevant. We could use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days. For simplicity and to avoid overcomplicating, we use the simple average.\n\n 28. But let's check: the data for 2016/5/30 is a Monday and the next day is Tuesday. The average of the five weekdays might be a good representation of a typical weekday, but it doesn't account for the day-of-week effect (Tuesday might be slightly different from Monday). However, without more data, we use this.\n\n 29. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But the data doesn't show extreme outliers.\n\n 30. We'll compute the average for each hour.\n\n 31. How to handle if there is a missing value in the historical data? The provided data seems complete.\n\n 32. Let's compute the forecast for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00 on 2016/5/31.\n\n 33. Example for hour 0:00 (the first hour of the day):\n        Historical hour 0:00:\n            5/24: 21.47\n            5/25: 21.64\n            5/26: 22.85\n            5/27: 23.65\n            5/30: 18.07\n        Average = (21.47+21.64+22.85+23.65+18.07)/5 = 107.68/5 = 21.536\n\n 34. Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 35. However, note that the price on 5/30 at 0:00 is 18.07, which is lower than the others. This might be because 5/30 is a Monday? But the previous Monday is not available. The average will smooth it.\n\n 36. We must output the forecast for the next 24 hours in the same format.\n\n 37. The dates will be from 2016/5/31 0:00 to 2016/5/31 23:00.\n\n 38. Let's compute all 24 hours:\n\n    Hour 0: (21.47 + 21.64 + 22.85 + 23.65 + 18.07) / 5 = 107.68 / 5 = 21.536 -> 21.54 (rounded to two decimals as in the input)\n    Hour 1: (21.06 + 21.14 + 22.51 + 22.85 + 14.17) / 5 = 101.73 / 5 = 20.346 -> 20.35\n    Hour 2: (19.99 + 20.88 + 22.46 + 21.96 + 12.69) / 5 = 97.98 / 5 = 19.596 -> 19.60\n    Hour 3: (19.62 + 20.38 + 22.46 + 20.69 + 11.55) / 5 = 94.7 / 5 = 18.94\n    Hour 4: (20.30 + 20.94 + 22.58 + 21.76 + 12.54) / 5 = 98.12 / 5 = 19.624 -> 19.62\n    Hour 5: (22.22 + 22.43 + 23.21 + 23.66 + 20.45) / 5 = 111.97 / 5 = 22.394 -> 22.39\n    Hour 6: (24.09 + 24.47 + 25.24 + 25.84 + 24.38) / 5 = 124.02 / 5 = 24.804 -> 24.80\n    Hour 7: (25.57 + 25.82 + 27.33 + 28.81 + 25.75) / 5 = 133.28 / 5 = 26.656 -> 26.66\n    Hour 8: (25.77 + 26.94 + 29.15 + 31.25 + 27.25) / 5 = 140.36 / 5 = 28.072 -> 28.07\n    Hour 9: (26.17 + 26.89 + 28.42 + 30.81 + 26.97) / 5 = 139.26 / 5 = 27.852 -> 27.85\n    Hour 10: (25.99 + 26.93 + 25.96 + 30.38 + 26.94) / 5 = 136.20 / 5 = 27.24\n    Hour 11: (25.96 + 25.99 + 25.73 + 30.18 + 26.38) / 5 = 134.24 / 5 = 26.848 -> 26.85\n    Hour 12: (25.76 + 26.04 + 25.51 + 29.27 + 25.87) / 5 = 132.45 / 5 = 26.49\n    Hour 13: (25.55 + 25.77 + 25.30 + 27.85 + 25.61) / 5 = 130.08 / 5 = 26.016 -> 26.02\n    Hour 14: (25.35 + 25.64 + 25.58 + 27.12 + 25.26) / 5 = 128.95 / 5 = 25.79\n    Hour 15: (24.81 + 24.57 + 25.13 + 25.57 + 24.51) / 5 = 124.59 / 5 = 24.918 -> 24.92\n    Hour 16: (24.65 + 24.46 + 25.49 + 25.65 + 24.45) / 5 = 124.70 / 5 = 24.94\n    Hour 17: (25.04 + 24.91 + 26.57 + 26.10 + 24.90) / 5 = 127.52 / 5 = 25.504 -> 25.50\n    Hour 18: (24.84 + 24.67 + 26.13 + 25.75 + 24.85) / 5 = 126.24 / 5 = 25.248 -> 25.25\n    Hour 19: (24.86 + 24.72 + 26.03 + 25.46 + 24.89) / 5 = 125.96 / 5 = 25.192 -> 25.19\n    Hour 20: (24.35 + 24.20 + 25.66 + 24.70 + 24.35) / 5 = 123.26 / 5 = 24.652 -> 24.65\n    Hour 21: (24.24 + 24.05 + 25.51 + 24.70 + 24.07) / 5 = 122.57 / 5 = 24.514 -> 24.51\n    Hour 22: (23.87 + 23.30 + 25.32 + 24.26 + 23.43) / 5 = 120.18 / 5 = 24.036 -> 24.04\n    Hour 23: (23.20 + 22.66 + 23.98 + 23.89 + 21.99) / 5 = 115.72 / 5 = 23.144 -> 23.14\n\n 39.
