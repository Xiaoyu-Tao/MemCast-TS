        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-09-08 00:00 to 2015-09-14 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-09-15 00:00 to 2015-09-15 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 consecutive hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on a time series model that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective model for short-term electricity price forecasting, such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: The price at the same hour of the previous day (24-hour seasonality) is a common baseline.\n   - However, we note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (lower at night, higher during the day) and also a weekly pattern (weekends are lower).\n\n But note: The last day in the data is Monday (2015-09-14) and we are forecasting for Tuesday (2015-09-15). \n We have 7 days of data (from 2015-09-08 to 2015-09-14). \n\n Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2015-09-08) and also consider the most recent day (Monday, 2015-09-14) and adjust for the weekly pattern.\n\n However, without additional data (like load and wind) and without a more sophisticated model, we have to use a simple approach.\n\n Proposed method:\n We will use a combination of:\n   - The same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2015-09-14) as a base.\n   - Adjust by the difference between the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2015-09-08) and the day before that (Monday, 2015-09-07) but note we don't have 2015-09-07.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays (we have 7 days: 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days). But note the weekend pattern is different.\n\n Since we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday) and we have one full week of data, we can compute the average hourly profile for weekdays (excluding the weekend) and then adjust by the level of the most recent day.\n\n Steps for the model:\n   Step 1: Identify weekdays in the data: \n        Tuesday (2015-09-08), Wednesday (2015-09-09), Thursday (2015-09-10), Friday (2015-09-11) -> weekdays\n        Saturday (2015-09-12), Sunday (2015-09-13) -> weekend\n        Monday (2015-09-14) -> weekday\n\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average price for the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday). Note: we have 5 weekdays.\n\n   Step 3: We note that the level of the time series might be changing. So we can adjust the average profile by the ratio of the last day (Monday) to the average of the same Monday's hours? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a multiplicative adjustment:\n\n        Let H(h) = average of hour h over the 5 weekdays.\n        Let M(h) = the price of the last day (Monday, 2015-09-14) at hour h.\n\n        Then the adjustment factor for the day level might be the ratio of the overall Monday average to the average of H(h) for Monday? \n\n   However, a simpler approach is to use the last day (Monday) as a base and then adjust by the typical Tuesday pattern relative to Monday.\n\n   We can compute the typical Tuesday/Monday ratio per hour from the available data? But we only have one Tuesday (2015-09-08) and one Monday (2015-09-14) in the data? Actually, we don't have the Monday of the previous week (2015-09-07) to compare with 2015-09-08.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the average hourly ratio of the next day (Tuesday) to the current day (Monday) from the available week? But we don't have consecutive weeks.\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we only have one week of data, we can do:\n\n        Forecast for hour h on Tuesday = (Price of hour h on the previous Tuesday) * (Average of Monday's prices) / (Average of the previous Monday's prices) \n\n   But we don't have the previous Monday (2015-09-07) in the data.\n\n   Therefore, we can use the average of the entire last day (Monday) and the average of the entire previous Tuesday to adjust the previous Tuesday's hourly pattern.\n\n   Let:\n        base_Tuesday = the Tuesday of 2015-09-08\n        last_Monday = 2015-09-14\n\n        total_avg_Tuesday = average of base_Tuesday (24 hours)\n        total_avg_Monday = average of last_Monday (24 hours)\n\n        Then, forecast for hour h on 2015-09-15 (Tuesday) = base_Tuesday[h] * (total_avg_Monday / total_avg_Tuesday)\n\n   But note: this assumes that the entire day's level is shifted by the ratio of the last Monday to the base Tuesday. However, the base Tuesday was a week ago and the market conditions might have changed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last day (Monday) and then adjust each hour by the typical Tuesday vs Monday difference from the base week? But we only have one Tuesday and one Monday in the base week? Actually, we don't have the Monday of the base week.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the weekdays (5 days) to get a typical Tuesday pattern? But that average includes multiple days. We can isolate the Tuesday pattern by taking the average of the Tuesday hour? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   Given the data limitations, we can use:\n\n        forecast = last_Monday's hourly prices * (typical_Tuesday_hourly_factor)\n\n   But we don't have a typical Tuesday factor.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the weekdays (excluding the weekend) and then adjust by the level of the last day? \n\n        Let H(h) = average of hour h over the 5 weekdays (2015-09-08, 09, 10, 11, 14)\n        Let total_avg_weekdays = average of all 5 weekdays (all 120 hours)\n\n        Then, the forecast for hour h = H(h) * (total_avg_last_Monday / total_avg_weekdays)\n\n   But note: the last Monday is one of the weekdays, so we are adjusting the average profile by the ratio of the last Monday's average to the overall average of weekdays.\n\n   How to compute:\n        total_avg_weekdays = (sum of all 5 weekdays' 24 hours) / (5*24)\n        total_avg_last_Monday = (sum of last Monday's 24 hours) / 24\n\n        Then, forecast_h = H(h) * (total_avg_last_Monday / total_avg_weekdays)\n\n   This method? It scales the typical hourly profile by the level of the last day.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n        Step 1: Extract the weekdays: \n            Tuesday (2015-09-08): day1\n            Wednesday (2015-09-09): day2\n            Thursday (2015-09-10): day3\n            Friday (2015-09-11): day4\n            Monday (2015-09-14): day5\n\n        Step 2: For each hour (0-23), compute H(h) = (day1[h] + day2[h] + day3[h] + day4[h] + day5[h]) / 5\n\n        Step 3: Compute total_avg_weekdays = (sum of all 120 prices) / 120\n\n        Step 4: Compute total_avg_last_Monday = (sum of day5) / 24\n\n        Step 5: For each hour h in 0..23, forecast = H(h) * (total_avg_last_Monday / total_avg_weekdays)\n\n   This method is a form of seasonal adjustment with a level scaling.\n\n   Let's do the calculations:\n\n        First, we extract the 5 weekdays:\n\n        Tuesday 2015-09-08: \n            [16.25, 15.91, 15.58, 15.88, 16.06, 16.99, 20.38, 24.16, 25.58, 25.93, 25.80, 24.64, 23.97, 23.84, 22.90, 22.86, 22.57, 22.85, 22.80, 23.55, 23.45, 23.13, 21.06, 19.73]\n\n        Wednesday 2015-09-09:\n            [16.18, 15.91, 15.81, 15.86, 16.06, 18.57, 21.88, 25.31, 26.01, 26.52, 26.21, 25.22, 24.09, 23.62, 22.57, 22.94, 22.72, 22.71, 22.76, 22.99, 22.84, 22.05, 20.77, 18.00]\n\n        Thursday 2015-09-10:\n            [16.41, 15.86, 15.62, 15.84, 16.25, 19.86, 22.71, 25.11, 26.64, 26.18, 25.67, 24.59, 24.30, 24.00, 23.11, 23.57, 23.47, 23.76, 23.11, 23.78, 23.35, 22.72, 21.02, 17.00]\n\n        Friday 2015-09-11:\n            [16.28, 15.48, 15.17, 15.14, 15.79, 18.60, 21.77, 24.59, 26.79, 26.27, 24.97, 23.76, 22.86, 21.88, 20.97, 20.11, 19.71, 20.26, 20.33, 20.88, 20.53, 19.09, 16.83, 15.07]\n\n        Monday 2015-09-14:\n            [13.53, 12.47, 12.12, 11.98, 12.59, 14.33, 18.55, 22.00, 22.95, 22.99, 22.96, 22.90, 22.91, 23.07, 22.28, 22.29, 21.59, 21.93, 21.89, 22.44, 21.55, 20.37, 17.15, 15.14]\n\n        Now, we compute H(h) for each hour (average of the 5 days at that hour):\n\n        Example for hour0 (00:00): \n            (16.25 + 16.18 + 16.41 + 16.28 + 13.53) / 5 = (79.65) / 5 = 15.93\n\n        Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n        Step 3: total_avg_weekdays = (sum of all 5 days' 24 hours) / 120\n\n        We can compute the sum for each day:\n\n            Tuesday: 16.25+15.91+...+19.73 = 516.29\n            Wednesday: 16.18+15.91+...+18.00 = 516.19\n            Thursday: 16.41+15.86+...+17.00 = 530.15\n            Friday: 16.28+15.48+...+15.07 = 480.19\n            Monday: 13.53+12.47+...+15.14 = 470.19\n\n            Total sum = 516.29 + 516.19 + 530.15 + 480.19 + 470.19 = 2513.01\n\n            total_avg_weekdays = 2513.01 / 120 = 20.94175\n\n        Step 4: total_avg_last_Monday = 470.19 / 24 = 19.59125\n\n        Step 5: scaling factor = 19.59125 / 20.94175 = 0.9355\n\n        Then, for each hour h, forecast = H(h) * 0.9355\n\n        We compute H for each hour:\n\n        Hour0: (16.25+16.18+16.41+16.28+13.53)/5 = 79.65/5 = 15.93 -> 15.93 * 0.9355 = 14.90\n        Hour1: (15.91+15.91+15.86+15.48+12.47)/5 = 75.63/5 = 15.126 -> 15.126 * 0.9355 = 14.15\n        ... and so on.\n\n   However, note that the last Monday (2015-09-14) is included in the average H(h). This might cause over-reliance on the last Monday? \n\n   Alternatively, we can exclude the last Monday from the average H(h) and then adjust by the ratio of the last Monday to the average of the previous weekdays? \n\n   But the problem is we are forecasting the next day which is a Tuesday, and we want to use the typical Tuesday pattern. We only have one Tuesday in the data (2015-09-08). \n\n   So another approach: use the previous Tuesday (2015-09-08) and adjust by the change from that Tuesday to the last Monday? \n\n        Let base_Tuesday = 2015-09-08\n        base_Tuesday_avg = average of base_Tuesday = 516.29 / 24 = 21.512083\n\n        last_Monday_avg = 19.59125\n\n        scaling factor = last_Monday_avg / base_Tuesday_avg = 19.59125 / 21.512083 = 0.9107\n\n        Then, forecast for hour h = base_Tuesday[h] * 0.9107\n\n        Example: hour0: 16.25 * 0.9107 = 14.80\n                 hour1: 15.91 * 0.9107 = 14.49\n\n   This method uses the pattern of the last Tuesday and adjusts it by the level of the last day (Monday) relative to that Tuesday.\n\n   Which method is better? We have to choose.\n\n   Considering that we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have a Tuesday pattern from the same week, we might prefer the second method.\n\n   However, the second method uses only one day (the Tuesday from a week ago) and the last Monday. The first method uses the average of all weekdays and then scales by the last Monday's level.\n\n   We note that the electricity prices can be volatile and the first method (using the average of 5 weekdays) might smooth out some noise.\n\n   Let's compare the two methods:\n\n        Method1: average profile of weekdays (5 days) scaled by the last Monday's level relative to the overall average.\n        Method2: the specific Tuesday from a week ago scaled by the last Monday's level relative to that Tuesday.\n\n   We don't have the actual values for the next day to validate. \n\n   Considering the data, we note that the last Monday (2015-09-14) has lower prices than the previous weekdays. The base Tuesday (2015-09-08) had an average of 21.51, and the last Monday 19.59. \n\n   The overall average of weekdays (5 days) is 20.94, so the scaling factor for method1 is 19.59/20.94 = 0.9355, and for method2 is 19.59/21.51 = 0.9107.\n\n   We can also consider a hybrid: use the two Tuesdays we have? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   Given the context, I choose method2 because it uses the specific day of the week (Tuesday) and adjusts by the most recent day's level. \n\n   But note: the base Tuesday was a week ago and the market might have changed. However, without more data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n   Therefore, we will use:\n\n        forecast_h = base_Tuesday[h] * (last_Monday_avg / base_Tuesday_avg)\n\n   Steps:\n\n        base_Tuesday = [16.25, 15.91, 15.58, 15.88, 16.06, 16.99, 20.38, 24.16, 25.58, 25.93, 25.80, 24.64, 23.97, 23.84, 22.90, 22.86, 22.57, 22.85, 22.80, 23.55, 23.45, 23.13, 21.06, 19.73]\n\n        base_Tuesday_avg = 516.29 / 24 = 21.512083333333333\n\n        last_Monday_avg = 470.19 / 24 = 19.59125\n\n        scaling_factor = 19.59125 / 21.512083333333333 = 0.9107 (rounded to 4 decimals)\n\n        Then for each hour h in 0..23:\n\n            forecast = base_Tuesday[h] * 0.9107\n\n   Let's compute the 24 values:\n\n        h0: 16.25 * 0.9107 = 14.798875 -> 14.80\n        h1: 15.91 * 0.9107 = 14.489237 -> 14.49\n        h2: 15.58 * 0.9107 = 14.188706 -> 14.19\n        h3: 15.88 * 0.9107 = 14.461916 -> 14.46\n        h4: 16.06 * 0.9107 = 14.625842 -> 14.63\n        h5: 16.99 * 0.9107 = 15.472793 -> 15.47\n        h6: 20.38 * 0.9107 = 18.560066 -> 18.56\n        h7: 24.16 * 0.9107 = 22.002512 -> 22.00\n        h8: 25.58 * 0.9107 = 23.295706 -> 23.30\n        h9: 25.93 * 0.9107 = 23.614451 -> 23.61\n        h10: 25.80 * 0.9107 = 23.49606 -> 23.50\n        h11: 24.64 * 0.9107 = 22.439648 -> 22.44\n        h12: 23.97 * 0.9107 = 21.829479 -> 21.83\n        h13: 23.84 * 0.9107 = 21.711088 -> 21.71\n        h14: 22.90 * 0.9107 = 20.85503 -> 20.86\n        h15: 22.86 * 0.9107 = 20.818602 -> 20.82\n        h16: 22.57 * 0.9107 = 20.560499 -> 20.56\n        h17: 22.85 * 0.9107 = 20.809495 -> 20.81\n        h18: 22.80 * 0.9107 = 20.76396 -> 20.76\n        h19: 23.55 * 0.9107 = 21.446985 -> 21.45\n        h20: 23.45 * 0.9107 = 21.355915 -> 21.36\n        h21: 23.13 * 0.9107 = 21.064491 -> 21.06\n        h22: 21.06 * 0.9107 = 19.179342 -> 19.18\n        h23: 19.73 * 0.9107 = 17.968111 -> 17.97\n\n   But note: the last Monday (2015-09-14) had a very low night prices (around 12-13) and our forecast for the night of Tuesday is around 14.80, 14.49, etc. which is higher than the last Monday. This might be because the base Tuesday had higher night prices. \n\n   Alternatively, we can try method1 and see the night prices:\n\n        Method1: \n            H(0) = (16.25+16.18+16.41+16.28+13.53)/5 = 79.65/5 = 15.93\n            scaling factor = 19.59125 / 20.94175 = 0.9355\n            H(0) * 0.9355 = 15.93 * 0.9355 = 14.90\n\n        This is similar to method2.\n\n   Given the data, we'll go with method2.\n\n   However, note that the base Tuesday (2015-09-08) was the first day in the data and the last Monday (2015-09-14) is the last day. The market might have a downward trend. \n\n   We can also consider a simple average of the two methods? But without validation, we choose method2.\n\n   Therefore, the forecast for 2015-09-15 00:00 to 2015-09-15 23:00 is:\n\n        00:00: 14.80\n        01:00: 14.49\n        02:00: 14.19\n        03:00: 14.46\n        04:00: 14.63\n        05:00: 15.47\n        06:00: 18.56\n        07:00: 22.00\n        08:00: 23.30\n        09:00: 23.61\n        10:00: 23.50\n        11:00: 22.44\n        12:00: 21.83\n        13:00: 21.71\n        14:00: 20.86\n        15:00: 20.82\n        16:00: 20.56\n        17:00: 20.81\n        18:00: 20.76\n        19:00: 21.45\n        20:00: 21.36\n        21:00: 21.06\n        22:00: 19.18\n        23:00: 17.97\n\n   We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the input data has two decimal places.\n\n   Let's write the forecast in the required format.\n\n   The next day is 2015/9/15.\n\n   We output:\n\n        2015/9/15 0:00 14.80\n        2015/9/15 1:00 14.49\n        ... \n\n   We must output 24 hours.\n\n   However, note that the base Tuesday (2015-09-08) had a pattern that might not be exactly the same as the upcoming Tuesday. But with the data we have, this is a reasonable forecast.\n\n   We'll output the forecast as computed.\n\n   Note: This is a simple heuristic. In practice, more sophisticated models (like ARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning models) with exogenous variables would be used, but we are limited by the data and the requirement to do it without additional libraries.\n\n   We assume the date format: \"2015/9/15 0:00\" -> but the input had \"2015/9/8 0:00\", so we use the same format.\n\n   The next day after 2015/9/14 is 2015/9/15.\n\n   Let's write the answer.\n",
