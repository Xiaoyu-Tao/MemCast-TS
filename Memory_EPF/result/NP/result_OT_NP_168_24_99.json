        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (7 days * 24 hours). We are to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2014/12/2 0:00 to 2014/12/2 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 records). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed price) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting using only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only using the historical prices, we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality (24-hour period). \n A common approach is to use a seasonal ARIMA model or exponential smoothing with seasonality.\n\n However, note that we are in a constrained environment and must provide a forecast without the ability to run complex model training.\n\n Alternative: We can use a simple method such as:\n   - Using the average of the same hour in the past 7 days (i.e., a seasonal naive method with a 24-hour period) \n   - Or, to account for recent trends, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last few days.\n\n But note: The data shows a weekly pattern? We have 7 days. Let's see the pattern:\n\n We have:\n   Weekdays: 25,26,27,28 (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu) and then 29,30 (Sat, Sun) and then 1 (Mon).\n\n Since the next day is 2014/12/2 (a Tuesday), we can look at the previous Tuesday (2014/11/26) and also consider the recent Monday (2014/12/1) and the same day of the week from last week.\n\n However, without additional variables and with only 7 days, a simple approach is to take the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that might not capture the weekly pattern well.\n\n Considering the data, we note that:\n   - The prices have a daily pattern: low at night, rising in the morning, peak in the morning/afternoon, and then decreasing in the evening.\n\n We can try:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) of the next day (2014/12/2), we take the average of the same hour h from the last 3 days? or 7 days? \n\n But note: the last 7 days include both weekdays and weekends. The weekend (29,30) had lower prices. Since 2014/12/2 is a Tuesday, we might look at the previous Tuesday (2014/11/26) and the Monday (2014/12/1) and then the same day of the week from the week before? \n\n However, we only have one week of data. So we have one Tuesday (26th) and one Monday (25th and 1st). \n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days.\n\n Proposed method:\n   For each hour h (0-23) in the forecast day, we compute:\n      forecast_h = (w1 * price_h_prev1 + w2 * price_h_prev2 + ... + w7 * price_h_prev7) / (w1+...+w7)\n\n We can be simple: use equal weights for the same hour of the last 3 days? But note that the last 3 days include Sunday (30th) and Monday (1st) and Saturday (29th). The Tuesday (26th) is 6 days back.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from:\n   - The same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday 26th) and then adjust by the recent trend.\n\n How about:\n   base = the same hour from last Tuesday (26th)\n   then adjust by the trend from the last two days (Monday 1st and Sunday 30th) compared to the same days the previous week?\n\n But that might be complex.\n\n Given the simplicity required, we note that the data does not show a strong trend over the week, but there is daily seasonality.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days that are the same day of the week? But we only have one previous Tuesday.\n\n Therefore, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 3 days (regardless of the day of the week) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 24 hours?\n\n However, the problem is we are only to use the given data and we must be simple.\n\n I propose:\n   We use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (i.e., 2014/12/1, 2014/11/30, 2014/11/29) for each hour.\n\n But note: 2014/12/1 is Monday, 2014/11/30 is Sunday, 2014/11/29 is Saturday. The next day is Tuesday. So we are averaging Saturday, Sunday, Monday to predict Tuesday? That might not be ideal.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the last Monday (2014/12/1) and the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014/11/26) and then the same hour from the previous Wednesday (2014/11/27) to get a more similar day of the week? \n\n We have:\n   For Tuesday (2014/12/2) at hour 0: \n        use the value from 2014/12/1 0:00 (Monday), 2014/11/26 0:00 (Tuesday), 2014/11/25 0:00 (Monday) -> but that's two Mondays and one Tuesday.\n\n How about: \n   For each hour h, we take the average of:\n        same hour h from the same day of the week in the previous week (i.e., Tuesday 26th) and \n        same hour h from the two most recent days (Monday 1st and Sunday 30th) but that might not be consistent.\n\n Given the complexity and without a clear trend, I will use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (1st, 30th, 29th) as a simple forecast.\n\n But note: the prices on the weekend (29th and 30th) are lower than weekdays. The next day is a weekday (Tuesday). So we might expect higher prices.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the last Tuesday (26th) and the last Monday (1st and 25th) and then average? \n\n We have two Mondays (25th and 1st) and one Tuesday (26th). We can average these three for each hour? \n\n However, the Monday 25th is a week ago, so we might give more weight to the recent Monday (1st).\n\n Proposed: \n   For each hour h, \n        forecast_h = (2 * price_h_2014-12-1 + 1 * price_h_2014-11-26 + 1 * price_h_2014-11-25) / 4\n\n Why 2 for the last Monday? Because it's the most recent and same day of the week (Monday) and the day before the forecast day (Tuesday) is often similar to Monday? \n\n But note: the data for 2014/12/1 (Monday) and 2014/11/25 (Monday) and 2014/11/26 (Tuesday) are all weekdays.\n\n However, we don't have a strong reason to choose this.\n\n After looking at the data, we see that the prices on 2014/12/1 (Monday) are generally higher than the weekend and similar to the previous Monday (25th) and Tuesday (26th). \n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour for the last Monday (1st), the previous Tuesday (26th) and the previous Monday (25th). \n\n But note: the previous Monday (25th) is 7 days before the last Monday (1st). So we are taking:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_h_2014-12-1 + price_h_2014-11-26 + price_h_2014-11-25) / 3\n\n Let's test for one hour: hour 0:00\n   2014/12/1 0:00: 30.23\n   2014/11/26 0:00: 31.17\n   2014/11/25 0:00: 30.08\n   average = (30.23+31.17+30.08)/3 = 30.4933\n\n But we note that the price at 0:00 on 2014/11/27 (Wednesday) was 30.43, 2014/11/28 (Thursday) was 30.05, 2014/11/29 (Saturday) was 30.70, 2014/11/30 (Sunday) was 31.14.\n\n The average of the last 7 days at 0:00 is about 30.5. So 30.49 is in the range.\n\n However, we are forecasting for a Tuesday. The previous Tuesday (26th) had 31.17 at 0:00, and the Monday (1st) had 30.23 and the Monday (25th) had 30.08. \n\n We might also consider that the overall level of prices on 2014/12/1 was a bit lower than 2014/11/26? \n\n Without a clear trend, we stick to the average.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but there are none. \n\n We will forecast the next 24 hours by taking for each hour the average of the same hour from the three weekdays: 2014/12/1 (Monday), 2014/11/26 (Tuesday), and 2014/11/25 (Monday).\n\n However, 2014/11/25 and 2014/12/1 are both Mondays, and 2014/11/26 is a Tuesday. The next day is Tuesday. So we are using two Mondays and one Tuesday to predict a Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the two most recent weekdays (which are 2014/12/1 and 2014/11/28 (Friday? but we don't have Friday? wait, 2014/11/28 was a Friday? Actually, 2014/11/25 was Tuesday? Let me check:\n\n 25/11/2014: Tuesday\n 26/11/2014: Wednesday? Wait, the data says 2014/11/25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 1/12.\n\n Actually, 2014/11/25: Tuesday? \n  But the next day 26 is Wednesday? That doesn't match. \n\n Let me clarify the days of the week for the given data:\n\n 2014/11/25: Tuesday? (But 2014/11/25 is actually a Tuesday, 25 November 2014 was a Tuesday? Let me check: \n  25 November 2014: Tuesday (confirmed by calendar)\n\n So:\n  2014/11/25: Tuesday\n  2014/11/26: Wednesday\n  2014/11/27: Thursday\n  2014/11/28: Friday\n  2014/11/29: Saturday\n  2014/11/30: Sunday\n  2014/12/1: Monday\n\n Then the next day is 2014/12/2: Tuesday.\n\n Therefore, for forecasting 2014/12/2 (Tuesday), we have:\n\n   Same day of the week (Tuesday) in the past: only 2014/11/25 (Tuesday) from last week.\n\n   The day before (Monday) we have 2014/12/1.\n\n   We also have the Tuesday from two weeks ago? But we don't have that.\n\n So we have only one historical Tuesday (2014/11/25) and the Monday (2014/12/1) and then we can use the Sunday (2014/11/30) and Saturday (2014/11/29) but they are weekends.\n\n How about we use:\n\n   For each hour, we take the average of:\n      the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2014/11/25) and \n      the same hour on the most recent Monday (2014/12/1) and \n      the same hour on the most recent Tuesday? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday 2014/12/1 and Friday 2014/11/28) and the previous Tuesday (2014/11/25). But Friday is not as similar to Tuesday.\n\n Given the data, I think the best we can do is to use the average of the same hour for:\n\n   - The same day of the week from the previous week (Tuesday 2014/11/25) \n   - The same hour from the day before (Sunday 2014/11/30) and the day before that (Saturday 2014/11/29) are weekends and not representative.\n\n But note: the day before the forecast day is Monday (2014/12/1), which is a weekday. So we can use:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_h_2014-12-1 + price_h_2014-11-25) / 2\n\n Why? Because 2014/12/1 is the most recent day (Monday) and 2014/11/25 is the same day of the week (Tuesday) from last week.\n\n However, we have only two points. We can also include the Wednesday of last week (2014/11/26) because it is a weekday and close in the week? \n\n But note: the next day is Tuesday, and Wednesday is the next day after Tuesday. So we can include it? \n\n Let me try for hour 0:00:\n\n   (30.23 (2014/12/1) + 30.08 (2014/11/25)) / 2 = 30.155\n\n But the previous Tuesday at 0:00 was 30.08 and the Monday at 0:00 was 30.23. The Wednesday at 0:00 was 31.17. \n\n If we include Wednesday (2014/11/26) at 0:00 (31.17), then:\n\n   (30.23 + 30.08 + 31.17) / 3 = 30.4933\n\n This seems more reasonable.\n\n So I will use the average of the same hour for the three weekdays: \n   - the most recent Monday (2014/12/1)\n   - the same day of the week from last week (Tuesday 2014/11/25)\n   - the next day after the same day of the week last week (Wednesday 2014/11/26) to capture the next day effect? \n\n But note: we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we are using the previous Tuesday, the next day (Wednesday) of that Tuesday, and the most recent Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last three weekdays: which are 2014/12/1 (Monday), 2014/11/28 (Friday), and 2014/11/27 (Thursday). But we skip the weekend? \n\n The last three weekdays (excluding weekend) are: \n   2014/12/1 (Monday), 2014/11/28 (Friday), 2014/11/27 (Thursday), 2014/11/26 (Wednesday), 2014/11/25 (Tuesday).\n\n We want to use the most recent three weekdays: 2014/12/1, 2014/11/28, 2014/11/27.\n\n But then we are using Monday, Friday, Thursday to predict a Tuesday? \n\n Given the complexity, I think the safest is to use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which are 2014/12/1, 2014/11/30, 2014/11/29) even though the weekend days are included. \n\n Why? Because the weekend days are the most recent and might have similar patterns? \n\n However, the weekend days have lower prices. The next day is a weekday, so we expect higher. \n\n How about we use the last 3 weekdays (excluding weekends) but we only have 2014/12/1 and then we have to go back to 2014/11/28 (Friday) and 2014/11/27 (Thursday). \n\n Then for hour 0:00:\n   2014/12/1: 30.23\n   2014/11/28: 30.05\n   2014/11/27: 30.43\n   average = (30.23+30.05+30.43)/3 = 30.2367\n\n This is lower than the previous Tuesday (30.08) and we expect a Tuesday to be around 30.08 to 31.17? \n\n But note: the overall level of the last few days has been lower than the previous week? \n\n We see that the prices on 2014/12/1 were lower than 2014/11/25 and 2014/11/26. \n\n So using the last three weekdays might be better because it reflects a recent downward trend.\n\n Therefore, I decide to use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Monday 2014/12/1, Friday 2014/11/28, Thursday 2014/11/27). \n\n But wait, the last three weekdays are not consecutive in the data? They are separated by the weekend. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the last three days that are weekdays, which are:\n   2014/12/1 (Monday) -> most recent weekday\n   2014/11/28 (Friday) -> 3 days before (skipping weekend)\n   2014/11/27 (Thursday) -> 4 days before\n\n We can also include 2014/11/26 (Wednesday) but that is 5 days before.\n\n Given that we want recent data, we take the last three weekdays: 2014/12/1, 2014/11/28, 2014/11/27.\n\n Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n   forecast_h = (price_h on 2014/12/1 + price_h on 2014/11/28 + price_h on 2014/11/27) / 3\n\n But note: 2014/11/27 is Thursday, 2014/11/28 is Friday, and 2014/12/1 is Monday. The next day is Tuesday.\n\n We are averaging Thursday, Friday, Monday to predict Tuesday.\n\n This might not be ideal, but it uses the most recent weekdays.\n\n Let's do it and then we can see if the values make sense.\n\n We'll compute for each hour.\n\n Example for hour 0:00: (30.23 + 30.05 + 30.43) / 3 = 30.2367 -> round to 2 decimals: 30.24\n\n Example for hour 1:00: \n   2014/12/1 1:00: 29.80\n   2014/11/28 1:00: 29.68\n   2014/11/27 1:00: 30.22\n   average = (29.80+29.68+30.22)/3 = 29.90\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data for 2014/11/27, 2014/11/28, and 2014/12/1 are all available.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014/12/2 0:00 to 23:00) using this method.\n\n We create a list for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (30.23 + 30.05 + 30.43) / 3 = 30.2367 -> 30.24\n Hour 1: (29.80 + 29.68 + 30.22) / 3 = 29.90\n Hour 2: (29.57 + 29.41 + 29.77) / 3 = 29.5833 -> 29.58\n Hour 3: (29.69 + 29.46 + 29.74) / 3 = 29.63\n Hour 4: (30.08 + 29.86 + 30.20) / 3 = 30.0467 -> 30.05\n Hour 5: (30.91 + 30.92 + 31.42) / 3 = 31.0833 -> 31.08\n Hour 6: (32.55 + 32.16 + 33.04) / 3 = 32.5833 -> 32.58\n Hour 7: (34.44 + 33.86 + 34.80) / 3 = 34.3667 -> 34.37\n Hour 8: (34.83 + 34.21 + 34.70) / 3 = 34.58\n Hour 9: (34.51 + 33.93 + 34.49) / 3 = 34.31\n Hour 10: (34.18 + 33.73 + 34.16) / 3 = 34.0233 -> 34.02\n Hour 11: (33.85 + 33.37 + 33.91) / 3 = 33.71\n Hour 12: (33.70 + 33.02 + 33.77) / 3 = 33.4967 -> 33.50\n Hour 13: (33.77 + 33.04 + 33.78) / 3 = 33.53\n Hour 14: (34.28 + 33.19 + 34.08) / 3 = 33.85\n Hour 15: (34.69 + 33.10 + 34.65) / 3 = 34.1467 -> 34.15\n Hour 16: (36.12 + 33.65 + 34.91) / 3 = 34.8933 -> 34.89\n Hour 17: (35.96 + 33.84 + 34.68) / 3 = 34.8267 -> 34.83\n Hour 18: (34.96 + 33.41 + 34.55) / 3 = 34.3067 -> 34.31\n Hour 19: (33.89 + 32.72 + 33.82) / 3 = 33.4767 -> 33.48\n Hour 20: (33.04 + 32.09 + 33.11) / 3 = 32.7467 -> 32.75\n Hour 21: (32.64 + 31.72 + 32.37) / 3 = 32.2433 -> 32.24\n Hour 22: (31.94 + 31.33 + 31.70) / 3 = 31.6567 -> 31.66\n Hour 23: (31.20 + 30.65 + 30.79) / 3 = 30.88\n\n But wait, the hour 16 on 2014/12/1 was 36.12, which is much higher than the same hour on the other two days. This might be an outlier? But we are taking the average.\n\n We'll go with this.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2014/12/2 from 0:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n 0:00: 30.24\n 1:00: 29.90\n 2:00: 29.58\n 3:00: 29.63\n 4:00: 30.05\n 5:00: 31.08\n 6:00: 32.58\n 7:00: 34.37\n 8:00: 34.58\n 9:00: 34.31\n10:00: 34.02\n11:00: 33.71\n12:00: 33.50\n13:00: 33.53\n14:00: 33.85\n15:00: 34.15\n16:00: 34.89\n17:00: 34.83\n18:00: 34.31\n19:00: 33.48\n20:00: 32.75\n21:00: 32.24\n22:00: 31.66\n23:00: 30.88\n\n We output in the required format.\n\n Note: We are rounding to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n However, the input has two decimal places.
