        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013/6/11 0:00 to 2013/6/17 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2013/6/18 0:00 to 2013/6/18 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the target variable (OT).\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: \n   - Seasonal Naive method: The electricity prices often exhibit daily seasonality (24 hours). So, we can use the prices from the same hour of the previous day (or same day of the week) as the forecast.\n\n However, note that the data includes a week (from Monday 2013/6/11 to Monday 2013/6/17). The next day is Tuesday (2013/6/18). \n We can use the previous Tuesday (2013/6/11) as a reference? But note: 2013/6/11 was a Tuesday? Actually, 2013/6/11 is a Tuesday? Let's check: \n   - 2013/6/11: Tuesday (by checking a calendar for 2013, but we don't have the day of week in the data). Alternatively, we can use the last 7 days to capture the weekly pattern.\n\n But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's observe:\n\n We have:\n   Tuesday (2013-06-11) to Monday (2013-06-17). The next day is Tuesday (2013-06-18).\n\n Since we are forecasting 24 hours, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2013-06-11) as the forecast? However, note that the pattern might change.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without additional data, the seasonal naive is a common baseline.\n\n However, let me note: the data from 2013/6/16 (Sunday) and 2013/6/17 (Monday) might have different patterns. We are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n Since we are only given the target variable and no other features, and we are to forecast 24 hours, we can use:\n\n   Forecast for 2013/6/18 0:00 = value of 2013/6/11 0:00? (same day of the week, same hour) \n   But that was 7 days ago.\n\n However, we can also consider the average of the same hour over the past week? But note: the week includes a weekend (Saturday and Sunday) which are different.\n\n Since the next day is a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2013-06-11) as the forecast? \n\n But let's look at the data: \n   The prices on 2013-06-11 (Tuesday) and 2013-06-18 (the next Tuesday) might be similar? \n\n However, we don't have data for the same day of the previous week for the entire day? Actually, we do: 2013-06-11 is the same day of the week (Tuesday) as 2013-06-18.\n\n Therefore, we can use the values from 2013-06-11 (which is the previous Tuesday) for the forecast.\n\n But note: the data for 2013-06-11 is from 0:00 to 23:00. We can use that as the forecast for 2013-06-18.\n\n However, let's check if there is a trend? The overall level of prices in the last week has been decreasing? \n\n Alternatively, we can adjust the level by the average change over the week? \n\n But for simplicity and given the problem constraints (only target variable and no other features) we use:\n\n   Seasonal Naive: using the same day of the previous week.\n\n So, the forecast for 2013/6/18 0:00 is the same as 2013/6/11 0:00 (38.59), and so on.\n\n However, let me check the data: \n   2013/6/11: 38.59 at 0:00 -> forecast for 2013/6/18 0:00: 38.59\n\n But note: the last day in the data is 2013/6/17 (Monday) and we are forecasting Tuesday. We don't observed the same day of the week in the immediate past? We have to go back 7 days.\n\n However, we can also consider using the most recent day that is the same day of the week? That is 2013/6/11.\n\n But what if we see a trend? We can adjust by the average change in the last week? \n\n Let me calculate the average price for each day:\n\n   2013-06-11 (Tue): average = (38.59+37.23+...+38.98)/24 = let's compute quickly: \n        We can skip exact calculation, but we can see the values.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a drift method? \n\n However, the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (none in the given data) and provide the forecast.\n\n Considering the above, I will use the seasonal naive method with a weekly seasonality (168 hours) because the data shows a weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2013/6/18 0:00 to 2013/6/18 23:00) will be the same as the values from 2013/6/11 0:00 to 2013/6/11 23:00.\n\n But note: the data for 2013/6/11 is:\n\n 2013/6/11 0:00 38.59\n 2013/6/11 1:00 37.23\n 2013/6/11 2:00 35.45\n 2013/6/11 3:00 34.70\n 2013/6/11 4:00 35.01\n 2013/6/11 5:00 38.42\n 2013/6/11 6:00 39.87\n 2013/6/11 7:00 42.34\n 2013/6/11 8:00 44.37\n 2013/6/11 9:00 45.49\n 2013/6/11 10:00 46.81\n 2013/6/11 11:00 45.49\n 2013/6/11 12:00 45.18\n 2013/6/11 13:00 44.71\n 2013/6/11 14:00 42.63\n 2013/6/11 15:00 41.56\n 2013/6/11 16:00 41.36\n 2013/6/11 17:00 41.26\n 2013/6/11 18:00 40.95\n 2013/6/11 19:00 41.34\n 2013/6/11 20:00 40.77\n 2013/6/11 21:00 40.67\n 2013/6/11 22:00 40.17\n 2013/6/11 23:00 38.98\n\n So, the forecast for 2013/6/18 0:00 is 38.59, 2013/6/18 1:00 is 37.23, ... until 2013/6/18 23:00 is 38.98.\n\n However, we must consider that the level of the time series might have changed. We can adjust by the average change per day? \n\n Let me compute the average price for the entire week:\n\n   Day 1 (2013-06-11): average = (sum of 24 hours)/24\n   Day 2 (2013-06-12): average = ... \n   ...\n   Day 7 (2013-06-17): average = ...\n\n Then the overall trend per day? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days and the average of the previous week? \n\n But note: we only have one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days (168 hours). The previous week we don't have.\n\n Since we don't have a long history, we can use the entire week to compute the average and then adjust the seasonal pattern by the ratio of the current level to the level of the same day last week? \n\n However, the problem is that we are forecasting the next day, and we don't have the current week's Tuesday? We have the previous Tuesday and then the next days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days to adjust the level? \n\n But for simplicity and because we are not given any other data, I will stick to the seasonal naive without adjustment.\n\n However, let me check: the average of the last day (2013-06-17) was about 36.5 (by quick scan) and the day we are using for the pattern (2013-06-11) was about 41? (by quick scan). \n\n We can adjust by the ratio of the average of the last 7 days? \n\n But note: we are forecasting only one day. We can adjust the entire day by a constant shift? \n\n Let me compute:\n\n   Average of 2013-06-11 (the Tuesday we are using): \n        Sum = 38.59+37.23+35.45+34.70+35.01+38.42+39.87+42.34+44.37+45.49+46.81+45.49+45.18+44.71+42.63+41.56+41.36+41.26+40.95+41.34+40.77+40.67+40.17+38.98\n        = 38.59+37.23=75.82; +35.45=111.27; +34.70=145.97; +35.01=180.98; +38.42=219.4; +39.87=259.27; +42.34=301.61; +44.37=345.98; +45.49=391.47; +46.81=438.28; +45.49=483.77; +45.18=528.95; +44.71=573.66; +42.63=616.29; +41.56=657.85; +41.36=699.21; +41.26=740.47; +40.95=781.42; +41.34=822.76; +40.77=863.53; +40.67=904.2; +40.17=944.37; +38.98=983.35\n\n        Average = 983.35 / 24 = 40.9729\n\n   Now, the average of the last day (2013-06-17, Monday) is:\n        We have the data: \n        32.43,30.24,29.40,28.90,29.74,32.44,36.98,38.92,39.74,39.19,38.96,38.99,38.35,38.00,37.62,37.37,37.10,37.29,37.95,37.96,37.04,36.81,36.06,32.81\n\n        Sum = 32.43+30.24=62.67; +29.40=92.07; +28.90=120.97; +29.74=150.71; +32.44=183.15; +36.98=220.13; +38.92=259.05; +39.74=298.79; +39.19=337.98; +38.96=376.94; +38.99=415.93; +38.35=454.28; +38.00=492.28; +37.62=529.9; +37.37=567.27; +37.10=604.37; +37.29=641.66; +37.95=679.61; +37.96=717.57; +37.04=754.61; +36.81=791.42; +36.06=827.48; +32.81=860.29\n\n        Average = 860.29 / 24 = 35.8454\n\n   The average of the entire week? We don't have the entire week? We have 7 days. The average of the entire week (all 168 points) is the total sum of all 168 points divided by 168.\n\n   But we don't need that. We are forecasting a Tuesday. We have the previous Tuesday and the last day (Monday) which is the day before the forecast day.\n\n   We can adjust the forecast by the ratio of the Monday (the day before) to the Monday of the previous week? \n\n   But we don't have the Monday of the previous week? We have the Monday of the current week (2013-06-17) and the Monday of the previous week would be 2013-06-10? which is not in the data.\n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust by the change from the previous Tuesday to the current Monday? \n\n   The average of the previous Tuesday: 40.9729\n   The average of the current Monday: 35.8454\n\n   The ratio: 35.8454 / 40.9729 = 0.8748 (a decrease of about 12.5%)\n\n   We can multiply the entire Tuesday pattern by this ratio? \n\n   But note: the forecast day is Tuesday, and we are comparing with the previous Tuesday? \n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust by the difference in the average? \n\n   Shift = (average of last day) - (average of the same day of the previous week) \n        = 35.8454 - 40.9729 = -5.1275\n\n   Then we can shift the entire forecast by -5.1275? \n\n   Then the forecast for 2013/6/18 0:00 = 38.59 - 5.1275 = 33.4625\n\n   Similarly, for 1:00: 37.23 - 5.1275 = 32.1025, etc.\n\n   This is a simple level adjustment.\n\n   But note: the day of the week effect might be different? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last few days to adjust? \n\n   However, without more data, I will use the level-adjusted seasonal naive.\n\n   Steps for level-adjusted seasonal naive:\n\n        Let F(t) be the forecast for hour t of the next Tuesday.\n        Let H(t) be the historical value for the same hour t of the previous Tuesday.\n        Let A_prev = average of the previous Tuesday (40.9729)\n        Let A_last = average of the last day (Monday, 35.8454)\n\n        Then: F(t) = H(t) + (A_last - A_prev)\n\n   But note: the last day is Monday, and we are forecasting Tuesday. We don't have the Tuesday of the current week? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire last week? \n\n   But we don't have the entire last week? We have the previous week? Actually, we have one week of data? The data is from 2013-06-11 to 2013-06-17 (7 days). \n\n   We can compute the average of the entire week (all 168 points) and then compare with the average of the previous week? But we don't have the previous week.\n\n   So, we use the adjustment based on the last day? \n\n   However, the last day (Monday) is the day before the forecast day (Tuesday). The previous week: Monday (2013-06-10) is not available, so we cannot compare the Monday to Monday.\n\n   Therefore, I will use the adjustment based on the entire week? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days (which is the entire given data) and the average of the previous 7 days? But we don't have the previous 7 days.\n\n   Given the constraints, I will use the level shift as the difference between the average of the last day (Monday) and the average of the same day of the previous week (which we don't have). \n\n   Instead, we can use the average of the entire week (the 7 days we have) and then adjust the forecast by the trend? \n\n   But we don't have a trend over multiple weeks.\n\n   Therefore, I decide to use the seasonal naive without adjustment? \n\n   But the level has clearly dropped. \n\n   Another idea: use the average of the last 3 days? \n\n   We can compute the average of the last 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and the average of the same 3 days in the previous week? \n\n   The previous week: \n        Saturday: 2013-06-08? -> not in data.\n        Sunday: 2013-06-09? -> not in data.\n\n   So we cannot.\n\n   Given the above, I will use the level-adjusted method using the shift computed from the difference between the last day (Monday) and the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire week (the 7 days we have) and then adjust the forecast by the difference between the average of the entire week and the average of the previous week? But we don't have the previous week.\n\n   Therefore, I will use the seasonal naive without adjustment? \n\n   But let me see: the last day (Monday) was 35.8454 and the previous Tuesday was 40.9729. The forecast day is Tuesday. We don't know the relationship between Tuesday and Monday? \n\n   Without more information, I will use the unadjusted seasonal naive? \n\n   However, the problem says we are an expert. We must do better.\n\n   Another approach: use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would be a 24-hour seasonality? \n\n   But we have daily seasonality? Actually, electricity prices have both daily and weekly seasonality. \n\n   We can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday? \n\n   Therefore, we use the one Tuesday we have? \n\n   Considering the above, I will use the unadjusted seasonal naive.\n\n   But note: the data shows a downward trend over the week. The prices on Tuesday (2013-06-11) were higher than the following days. So the forecast might be overestimated.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last available Tuesday (2013-06-11) but adjust by the overall trend? \n\n   We can compute the linear trend over the entire week? \n\n   Let me compute the average per day:\n\n        Day1 (2013-06-11): 40.9729\n        Day2 (2013-06-12): \n            data: 38.22,36.96,...,36.77 -> \n            sum: 38.22+36.96=75.18; +35.66=110.84; +35.04=145.88; +35.82=181.7; +37.46=219.16; +39.14=258.3; +40.82=299.12; +41.78=340.9; +41.71=382.61; +41.77=424.38; +41.18=465.56; +40.93=506.49; +40.74=547.23; +40.86=588.09; +40.40=628.49; +40.31=668.8; +39.97=708.77; +40.04=748.81; +40.00=788.81; +39.80=828.61; +39.06=867.67; +38.53=906.2; +36.77=942.97\n            average = 942.97/24 = 39.2904\n\n        Day3 (2013-06-13): \n            data: 35.63,32.59,...,32.76 -> \n            ... we can skip exact calculation? \n            We can see the average is lower.\n\n        Instead, we can compute the average for each day:\n\n        Day1: 40.9729\n        Day2: 39.2904\n        Day3: (35.63+32.59+31.24+30.49+31.18+33.74+36.75+38.69+39.74+39.42+39.54+39.34+39.06+38.52+37.50+37.20+37.23+37.12+37.24+37.12+36.36+35.75+34.61+32.76) \n            = 35.63+32.59=68.22; +31.24=99.46; +30.49=129.95; +32.76= ... \n            Let me add: \n                35.63,32.59,31.24,30.49,31.18,33.74,36.75,38.69,39.74,39.42,39.54,39.34,39.06,38.52,37.50,37.20,37.23,37.12,37.24,37.12,36.36,35.75,34.61,32.76\n            = 35.63+32.59=68.22; 68.22+31.24=99.46; 99.46+30.49=129.95; 129.95+31.18=161.13; 161.13+33.74=194.87; 194.87+36.75=231.62; 231.62+38.69=270.31; 270.31+39.74=310.05; 310.05+39.42=349.47; 349.47+39.54=389.01; 389.01+39.34=428.35; 428.35+39.06=467.41; 467.41+38.52=505.93; 505.93+37.50=543.43; 543.43+37.20=580.63; 580.63+37.23=617.86; 617.86+37.12=654.98; 654.98+37.24=692.22; 692.22+37.12=729.34; 729.34+36.36=765.7; 765.7+35.75=801.45; 801.45+34.61=836.06; 836.06+32.76=868.82\n            average = 868.82/24 = 36.2008\n\n        Day4 (2013-06-14): \n            data: 31.24,28.68,...,34.27\n            = 31.24+28.68=59.92; +26.01=85.93; +24.90=110.83; +22.81=133.64; +29.44=163.08; +33.38=196.46; +36.28=232.74; +37.02=269.76; +36.97=306.73; +36.93=343.66; +36.55=380.21; +36.09=416.3; +35.62=451.92; +35.57=487.49; +35.00=522.49; +35.05=557.54; +35.60=593.14; +36.19=629.33; +36.63=665.96; +36.67=702.63; +36.47=739.1; +36.92=776.02; +34.27=810.29\n            average = 810.29/24 = 33.7621\n\n        Day5 (2013-06-15): \n            data: 31.97,31.37,...,31.21\n            = 31.97+31.37=63.34; +29.96=93.3; +28.92=122.22; +28.06=150.28; +29.05=179.33; +29.89=209.22; +31.95=241.17; +32.34=273.51; +34.95=308.46; +35.41=343.87; +35.22=379.09; +35.20=414.29; +34.21=448.5; +33.10=481.6; +32.48=514.08; +32.46=546.54; +32.47=579.01; +32.99=612.0; +32.48=644.48; +32.17=676.65; +31.76=708.41; +32.07=740.48; +31.21=771.69\n            average = 771.69/24 = 32.1538\n\n        Day6 (2013-06-16): \n            data: 29.90,24.69,...,32.49\n            = 29.90+24.69=54.59; +23.46=78.05; +19.05=97.1; +14.33=111.43; +13.37=124.8; +14.69=139.49; +24.55=164.04; +29.54=193.58; +31.10=224.68; +32.06=256.74; +32.39=289.13; +32.38=321.51; +31.92=353.43; +31.61=385.04; +31.53=416.57; +31.52=448.09; +31.97=480.06; +32.43=512.49; +32.57=545.06; +32.75=577.81; +34.50=612.31; +35.43=647.74; +32.49=680.23\n            average = 680.23/24 = 28.3429\n\n        Day7 (2013-06-17): 35.8454\n\n        The daily averages: \n            Tue: 40.9729\n            Wed: 39.2904\n            Thu: 36.2008\n            Fri: 33.7621\n            Sat: 32.1538\n            Sun: 28.3429\n            Mon: 35.8454\n\n        There is a clear weekly pattern: high on weekdays and low on weekends.\n\n        The forecast day is Tuesday. The previous Tuesday was 40.9729. The last day (Monday) was 35.8454.\n\n        We see that the Monday average (35.8454) is lower than the Tuesday average (40.9729) of the previous week.\n\n        We can use the previous Tuesday's pattern but scaled by the ratio of the last Monday to the previous Tuesday? \n\n        But that might not be accurate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the last week's Tuesday as the pattern, and then set the level to the average of the last few days? \n\n        Given the complexity and the requirement to provide a forecast, I will use the seasonal naive without adjustment.\n\n        But note: the next Tuesday might be similar to the previous Tuesday? \n\n        However, the overall week shows a downward trend? \n\n        The daily averages: 40.97, 39.29, 36.20, 33.76, 32.15, 28.34, 35.85 -> not a consistent downward trend, but a drop on the weekend and then a rise on Monday.\n\n        The Monday (35.85) is still below the previous Tuesday (40.97). \n\n        We can assume that the Tuesday will be around the level of the previous Tuesday? \n\n        Or we can assume that the Tuesday will be similar to the Monday but with a typical Tuesday pattern? \n\n        Without more data, I will use the previous Tuesday's values as the forecast.\n\n        Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2013/6/18) is the same as 2013/6/11.\n\n        We output:\n\n        2013/6/18 0:00 38.59\n        2013/6/18 1:00 37.23\n        ... until\n        2013/6/18 23:00 38.98\n\n        But note: the date in the output should be for 2013/6/18.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"forecast the data for the next 24 recorded hours\", and the last historical data is 2013/6/17 23:00, so next is 2013/6/18 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n        We output in the same style.\n\n        But the user might expect a more sophisticated method? \n\n        Given the time and data constraints, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n        We'll go with the unadjusted seasonal naive.\n\n        If there were missing values, we would have to impute them, but there are none.\n\n        Therefore, the forecast is:\n\n        2013/6/18 0:00 38.59\n        2013/6/18 1:00 37.23\n        2013/6/18 2:00 35.45\n        2013/6/18 3:00 34.70\n        2013/6/18 4:00 35.01\n        2013/6/18 5:00 38.42\n        2013/6/18 6:00 39.87\n        2013/6/18 7:00 42.34\n        2013/6/18 8:00 44.37\n        2013/6/18 9:00 45.49\n        2013/6/18 10:00 46.81\n        2013/6/18 11:00 45.49\n        2013/6/18 12:00 45.18\n        2013/6/18 13:00 44.71\n        2013/6/18 14:00 42.63\n        2013/6/18 15:00 41.56\n        2013/6/18 16:00 41.36\n        2013/6/18 17:00 41.26\n        2013/6/18 18:00 40.95\n        2013/6/18 19:00 41.34\n        2013/6/18 20:00 40.77\n        2013/6/18 21:00 40.67\n        2013/6/18 22:00 40.17\n        2013/6/18 23:00 38.98\n\n        We output in the required format.\n\n        However, note: the historical data has the format \"YYYY/MM/DD H:MM\", so we use the same.\n\n        But in the historical data, the hour is written as \"0:00\", \"1:00\", etc. without a leading zero for the hour? \n\n        We'll use the same: \"2013/6/18 0:00\", etc.\n\n        But note: the month is written as '6' for June, not '06'. And the day is '18', not '018'. So we use the same.\n\n        We output 24 lines.\n\n        Let's write the answer in the required format.\n",
