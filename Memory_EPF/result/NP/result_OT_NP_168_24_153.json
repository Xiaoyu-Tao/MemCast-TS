        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-12-08 00:00 to 2015-12-14 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-12-15 00:00 to 2015-12-15 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). However, we note that the data is given in chronological order and there are no explicit missing values in the provided sample.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, modeling weekly seasonality might be challenging.\n\n 4. We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: Seasonal Naive method, where the forecast for a given hour is the observed value from the same hour of the previous day. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past few days.\n\n 5. Considering the data, we note that the last day (2015-12-14) shows a significant spike in prices during the day (especially in the morning and afternoon). This might be due to a weekday effect (Monday) and the previous days were weekend (Saturday and Sunday). The next day to forecast is Tuesday (2015-12-15). Therefore, we might look at the previous Tuesday (2015-12-08) and also consider the pattern of the most recent day.\n\n 6. However, we only have one week of data. So we can try to use the last day (Monday) as a base and adjust with the pattern from the previous week's Tuesday? But note that the data from 2015-12-08 (Tuesday) is the first day in our data.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without more data history, we can do:\n\n    Option 1: Use the same day of the week from the previous week (i.e., use the values from 2015-12-08 for 2015-12-15). However, the market conditions might have changed.\n\n    Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But we only have 7 days, so that would be the average of each hour over the week.\n\n    Option 3: Use the most recent day (2015-12-14) as the forecast, but that was a Monday and we are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n 8. Considering the volatility and the recent spike on 2015-12-14 (Monday), and that the next day is Tuesday, we might expect a similar pattern to the previous Tuesday (2015-12-08) but adjusted by the recent trend.\n\n 9. However, note that the data on 2015-12-14 was exceptionally high. It might be an anomaly or a new trend? Without more context, we can use a weighted average of the previous week's same day and the most recent day? But that is arbitrary.\n\n10. Given the constraints, a simple and common approach is to use the Seasonal Naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours. That is, the next 24 hours will be the same as the last 24 hours we have (i.e., 2015-12-14 00:00 to 2015-12-14 23:00). But note that 2015-12-14 was a Monday and we are forecasting a Tuesday. However, in the absence of more data, this might be acceptable.\n\n11. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which includes the weekend and Monday) to capture the recent trend. But the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) had lower prices and Monday had a spike. The average might smooth the spike.\n\n12. Another idea: use the same day of the previous week (2015-12-08) and then adjust by the difference between the last two days? For example, the relative change from the previous week's Monday (2015-12-07, which we don't have) to the current Monday (2015-12-14) is not available.\n\n13. Given the challenge, I propose to use the last 24 hours (2015-12-14) as the forecast for the next 24 hours (2015-12-15). This is a naive forecast but it is common in short-term electricity markets to use the most recent day as a baseline, especially when there are no other variables.\n\n    However, note that the day of the week changes. But the data from 2015-12-14 (Monday) to 2015-12-15 (Tuesday) might be similar? We don't have enough data to confirm.\n\n14. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This would capture the weekly pattern. Let's calculate:\n\n    For hour 0: (2015-12-08 0:00, 2015-12-09 0:00, ... , 2015-12-14 0:00) -> average of 7 values.\n\n    This method would smooth out the spike on Monday, but it might be more stable.\n\n15. Considering the problem, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (the entire week) to forecast the next day. This is a simple seasonal average.\n\n    Why? Because we have exactly 7 days of data, so we can compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n    Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n        forecast_h = (price_h_day1 + price_h_day2 + ... + price_h_day7) / 7\n\n    Where:\n        day1: 2015-12-08 (Tuesday)\n        day2: 2015-12-09 (Wednesday)\n        day3: 2015-12-10 (Thursday)\n        day4: 2015-12-11 (Friday)\n        day5: 2015-12-12 (Saturday)\n        day6: 2015-12-13 (Sunday)\n        day7: 2015-12-14 (Monday)\n\n16. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll group the data by the hour of the day (ignoring the date) and take the average of the 7 days.\n\n    Example for hour 0:00:\n        Values: 19.55 (12/8), 17.33 (12/9), 15.34 (12/10), 16.91 (12/11), 17.99 (12/12), 20.04 (12/13), 21.91 (12/14)\n        Average = (19.55+17.33+15.34+16.91+17.99+20.04+21.91)/7 = 128.07 / 7 = 18.2957 \u2248 18.30\n\n    Similarly for other hours.\n\n17. However, note that the data on 2015-12-14 (Monday) was exceptionally high. This average will bring down the spike. But it might be a reasonable forecast for a Tuesday that is not as extreme as Monday.\n\n18. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days. For example, we can assign weights: \n    day1: 1, day2: 1, day3: 1, day4: 1, day5: 1, day6: 1, day7: 2 (so Monday has double weight). Then the total weight is 8.\n\n    For hour 0:00: \n        = (19.55*1 + 17.33*1 + 15.34*1 + 16.91*1 + 17.99*1 + 20.04*1 + 21.91*2) / (1+1+1+1+1+1+2)\n        = (19.55+17.33+15.34+16.91+17.99+20.04+43.82) / 8 = 150.98 / 8 = 18.8725 \u2248 18.87\n\n19. Given the volatility and the fact that the most recent day might be more indicative, I choose the weighted average with double weight for the last day.\n\n    Weights: \n        day1 (12/8): 1\n        day2 (12/9): 1\n        day3 (12/10): 1\n        day4 (12/11): 1\n        day5 (12/12): 1\n        day6 (12/13): 1\n        day7 (12/14): 2\n\n    Total weight = 8.\n\n20. We'll compute for each hour (0 to 23) the weighted average.\n\n21. Let's do the computation:\n\n    Hour 0: (19.55, 17.33, 15.34, 16.91, 17.99, 20.04, 21.91*2) \n        = 19.55 + 17.33 + 15.34 + 16.91 + 17.99 + 20.04 + 43.82 = 150.98 -> 150.98/8 = 18.8725 -> 18.87\n\n    Hour 1: (19.20, 16.18, 13.92, 16.09, 17.18, 19.17, 21.30*2)\n        = 19.20 + 16.18 + 13.92 + 16.09 + 17.18 + 19.17 + 42.60 = 144.34 -> 144.34/8 = 18.0425 -> 18.04\n\n    Hour 2: (19.07, 15.86, 13.03, 16.06, 16.79, 18.94, 21.13*2)\n        = 19.07+15.86+13.03+16.06+16.79+18.94+42.26 = 142.01 -> 142.01/8 = 17.75125 -> 17.75\n\n    Hour 3: (19.08, 15.86, 13.03, 16.36, 16.37, 18.99, 20.95*2)\n        = 19.08+15.86+13.03+16.36+16.37+18.99+41.90 = 141.59 -> 141.59/8 = 17.69875 -> 17.70\n\n    Hour 4: (19.40, 17.15, 14.71, 17.40, 16.79, 18.98, 21.58*2)\n        = 19.40+17.15+14.71+17.40+16.79+18.98+43.16 = 147.59 -> 147.59/8 = 18.44875 -> 18.45\n\n    Hour 5: (19.95, 18.32, 16.44, 18.81, 17.84, 19.28, 22.81*2)\n        = 19.95+18.32+16.44+18.81+17.84+19.28+45.62 = 156.26 -> 156.26/8 = 19.5325 -> 19.53\n\n    Hour 6: (21.94, 19.86, 19.38, 20.83, 18.75, 19.38, 28.06*2)\n        = 21.94+19.86+19.38+20.83+18.75+19.38+56.12 = 176.26 -> 176.26/8 = 22.0325 -> 22.03\n\n    Hour 7: (24.84, 21.39, 20.40, 21.62, 19.25, 19.36, 38.93*2)\n        = 24.84+21.39+20.40+21.62+19.25+19.36+77.86 = 204.72 -> 204.72/8 = 25.59\n\n    Hour 8: (25.93, 21.88, 20.46, 22.00, 20.04, 19.94, 50.20*2)\n        = 25.93+21.88+20.46+22.00+20.04+19.94+100.40 = 230.65 -> 230.65/8 = 28.83125 -> 28.83\n\n    Hour 9: (24.55, 21.33, 20.51, 21.92, 20.35, 21.18, 45.36*2)\n        = 24.55+21.33+20.51+21.92+20.35+21.18+90.72 = 220.56 -> 220.56/8 = 27.57\n\n    Hour 10: (23.40, 21.07, 20.32, 21.69, 20.52, 21.74, 40.27*2)\n        = 23.40+21.07+20.32+21.69+20.52+21.74+80.54 = 209.28 -> 209.28/8 = 26.16\n\n    Hour 11: (23.50, 21.03, 20.24, 21.67, 20.54, 22.20, 39.77*2)\n        = 23.50+21.03+20.24+21.67+20.54+22.20+79.54 = 208.72 -> 208.72/8 = 26.09\n\n    Hour 12: (22.93, 21.15, 20.24, 21.52, 20.46, 22.14, 37.34*2)\n        = 22.93+21.15+20.24+21.52+20.46+22.14+74.68 = 203.12 -> 203.12/8 = 25.39\n\n    Hour 13: (22.85, 21.05, 20.20, 21.37, 20.37, 22.13, 38.42*2)\n        = 22.85+21.05+20.20+21.37+20.37+22.13+76.84 = 204.81 -> 204.81/8 = 25.60125 -> 25.60\n\n    Hour 14: (22.87, 20.96, 20.24, 21.41, 20.47, 22.43, 38.60*2)\n        = 22.87+20.96+20.24+21.41+20.47+22.43+77.20 = 205.58 -> 205.58/8 = 25.6975 -> 25.70\n\n    Hour 15: (23.55, 21.45, 20.50, 21.65, 21.00, 23.00, 51.39*2)\n        = 23.55+21.45+20.50+21.65+21.00+23.00+102.78 = 233.93 -> 233.93/8 = 29.24125 -> 29.24\n\n    Hour 16: (23.92, 21.70, 20.73, 22.09, 21.70, 25.43, 50.76*2)\n        = 23.92+21.70+20.73+22.09+21.70+25.43+101.52 = 237.09 -> 237.09/8 = 29.63625 -> 29.64\n\n    Hour 17: (23.58, 21.88, 20.86, 22.40, 22.18, 28.95, 51.49*2)\n        = 23.58+21.88+20.86+22.40+22.18+28.95+102.98 = 242.83 -> 242.83/8 = 30.35375 -> 30.35\n\n    Hour 18: (22.88, 21.44, 20.64, 22.10, 22.00, 27.92, 46.88*2)\n        = 22.88+21.44+20.64+22.10+22.00+27.92+93.76 = 230.74 -> 230.74/8 = 28.8425 -> 28.84\n\n    Hour 19: (22.03, 20.44, 20.21, 21.09, 21.52, 25.27, 33.94*2)\n        = 22.03+20.44+20.21+21.09+21.52+25.27+67.88 = 198.44 -> 198.44/8 = 24.805 -> 24.81\n\n    Hour 20: (20.94, 20.03, 19.78, 20.48, 20.97, 24.17, 27.64*2)\n        = 20.94+20.03+19.78+20.48+20.97+24.17+55.28 = 181.65 -> 181.65/8 = 22.70625 -> 22.71\n\n    Hour 21: (20.49, 19.65, 19.52, 20.10, 20.74, 22.80, 24.55*2)\n        = 20.49+19.65+19.52+20.10+20.74+22.80+49.10 = 172.4 -> 172.4/8 = 21.55\n\n    Hour 22: (19.67, 18.74, 18.86, 19.32, 20.73, 22.10, 21.79*2)\n        = 19.67+18.74+18.86+19.32+20.73+22.10+43.58 = 163.0 -> 163.0/8 = 20.375 -> 20.38\n\n    Hour 23: (18.50, 16.57, 17.34, 16.94, 20.35, 21.38, 20.89*2)\n        = 18.50+16.57+17.34+16.94+20.35+21.38+41.78 = 152.86 -> 152.86/8 = 19.1075 -> 19.11\n\n22.
