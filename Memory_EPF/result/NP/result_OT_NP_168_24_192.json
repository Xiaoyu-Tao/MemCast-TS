        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-09-06 00:00 to 2016-09-12 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-09-13 00:00 to 2016-09-13 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values to handle.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and the dates. We don't have the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts, so we can only use the time series of prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the price data, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the daily seasonality (24 hours) and the short-term nature, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day as the forecast.\n   - However, note that the data shows weekly patterns? We have 7 days. We can also consider a model that uses the same hour from the same day of the previous week? But we only have one week of data.\n\n But note: the data provided is exactly 7 days (168 hours). We are to forecast the next day (24 hours). \n\n Since we don't have exogenous variables and only have the target series, we can use:\n   - A simple approach: use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days (if we assume weekly seasonality) OR\n   - Use the same hour from the previous day (if we assume daily seasonality) OR\n   - A combination.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the pattern of each day is similar: \n   - Low during the night, rising in the morning, peak during the day, and then falling in the evening.\n\n But note: the last day (2016-09-12) is a Monday, and the day we are forecasting (2016-09-13) is a Tuesday.\n\n We can look at the previous Tuesday (2016-09-06) and also consider the most recent day (Monday, 2016-09-12) and the trend.\n\n However, we are limited by the data. Since we have only the target, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n Considering the requirement for simplicity and the fact that we have exactly one week of data, I propose:\n\n   Forecast for hour h (where h from 0 to 23) on 2016-09-13 = \n        (value of hour h on 2016-09-06 [Tuesday] + value of hour h on 2016-09-12 [Monday]) / 2\n\n Why? Because 2016-09-06 is the same day of the week (Tuesday) as the forecast day (2016-09-13 is Tuesday) and 2016-09-12 is the immediate previous day (Monday). We are taking an average of the same day last week and the previous day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the entire week? But note: the week has different days (weekdays and weekend). The last two days (10th and 11th) are weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and the 12th is Monday. The 13th is Tuesday.\n\n We have one previous Tuesday (6th) and then the Monday (12th) which is the day before. Since the Monday is the most recent, it might be more indicative. But the Tuesday of the previous week is the same day.\n\n Another idea: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the Monday of that week? \n\n However, for simplicity and given the data, I will use the average of the same hour from the previous week's same day (Tuesday) and the previous day (Monday). \n\n But note: the data for 2016-09-06 (Tuesday) and 2016-09-12 (Monday) are both weekdays, but not the same day of the week. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the last three days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) and take an average? \n\n However, we are only 7 days. Let me check the pattern:\n\n   We are forecasting for Tuesday (2016-09-13). We have:\n        Last Tuesday (2016-09-06): a Tuesday\n        The day before (2016-09-12): Monday\n\n   We also have the Tuesday of the week before? But we don't have data beyond 7 days.\n\n   So we can only use the 7 days we have.\n\n   We can compute the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would include weekends which have a different pattern.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the weekdays? But we don't have enough data to average only Tuesdays (only one Tuesday).\n\n   Therefore, a simpler approach: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2016-09-12) as the base and adjust by the average change from Monday to Tuesday of the previous week.\n\n   How?\n        For each hour h:\n          base = value at hour h on 2016-09-12 (Monday)\n          Then, look at the same hour h on the previous Monday (2016-09-05) -> but we don't have that, because our data starts on 2016-09-06 (Tuesday).\n\n   We don't have the previous Monday. So we cannot compute the change from Monday to Tuesday for the previous week.\n\n   Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour from the last two days that are weekdays: \n        Monday (2016-09-12) and the previous Friday (2016-09-09) and Tuesday (2016-09-06) and then average? \n\n   But note: \n        Tuesday (2016-09-06) is a Tuesday, \n        Friday (2016-09-09) is a Friday, \n        Monday (2016-09-12) is a Monday.\n\n   They are all weekdays, but different days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But we have 5 weekdays in the data? \n\n   The data covers:\n        2016-09-06: Tuesday (weekday)\n        2016-09-07: Wednesday (weekday)\n        2016-09-08: Thursday (weekday)\n        2016-09-09: Friday (weekday)\n        2016-09-10: Saturday (weekend)\n        2016-09-11: Sunday (weekend)\n        2016-09-12: Monday (weekday)\n\n   We are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday). So we can use the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the past week? But note: we have only one Tuesday.\n\n   Given the constraints, I will use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday) but that would be too many and we don't know if they are similar.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average: more weight to the most recent day (Monday) and then the same day last week (Tuesday) and less to the others.\n\n   However, to keep it simple and given that we are only asked for a forecast without additional data, I will use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h on 2016-09-13 (Tuesday) = \n            (value at hour h on 2016-09-12 [Monday] + value at hour h on 2016-09-06 [Tuesday]) / 2\n\n   This is a simple average of the same hour from the most recent day and the same day of the previous week.\n\n   Why? Because the Monday is the most recent and might capture the current trend, and the Tuesday of last week captures the day-of-week effect.\n\n   Let's test with an example for hour 0:00:\n        Monday (2016-09-12 0:00): 22.67\n        Tuesday (2016-09-06 0:00): 24.18\n        Forecast for 2016-09-13 0:00: (22.67 + 24.18) / 2 = 23.425\n\n   But note: the data for the last Tuesday (2016-09-06) is a week old, and the market conditions might have changed.\n\n   Another idea: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust by the average change from Monday to Tuesday in the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of last week (2016-09-05) to compute the change.\n\n   Therefore, I stick to the simple average of the same hour and the same hour last week same day.\n\n   However, note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices? We can see that the prices on 2016-09-10 and 2016-09-11 are generally lower than the weekdays. So we are forecasting a weekday, and we should use only weekdays.\n\n   We have 5 weekdays: \n        Tuesday (2016-09-06), Wednesday (2016-09-07), Thursday (2016-09-08), Friday (2016-09-09), Monday (2016-09-12)\n\n   We can take the average of the same hour over these 5 weekdays? That would be a better representation of a typical weekday.\n\n   For hour 0:00:\n        Tuesday: 24.18\n        Wednesday: 20.60\n        Thursday: 23.38\n        Friday: 23.27\n        Monday: 22.67\n\n        Average = (24.18+20.60+23.38+23.27+22.67)/5 = 114.1/5 = 22.82\n\n   Then we can use that as the forecast for 2016-09-13 00:00.\n\n   This method: average of the same hour over the last 5 weekdays (excluding weekends) for the forecast.\n\n   Why? Because the day we are forecasting is a weekday (Tuesday) and we have 5 weekdays in the data.\n\n   This might be more robust.\n\n   Let me check the pattern for a peak hour, say 8:00:\n        Tuesday: 30.06\n        Wednesday: 27.74\n        Thursday: 29.17\n        Friday: 27.69\n        Monday: 28.61\n\n        Average = (30.06+27.74+29.17+27.69+28.61)/5 = 143.27/5 = 28.654\n\n   This seems reasonable.\n\n   Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 5 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) for the forecast.\n\n   Note: The days are:\n        Day0: 2016-09-06 (Tuesday)\n        Day1: 2016-09-07 (Wednesday)\n        Day2: 2016-09-08 (Thursday)\n        Day3: 2016-09-09 (Friday)\n        Day4: 2016-09-12 (Monday)\n\n   We skip the weekend days (2016-09-10 and 2016-09-11).\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23), we compute:\n        forecast_h = (h_hour from Day0 + Day1 + Day2 + Day3 + Day4) / 5\n\n   This will give us the 24 forecasted values.\n\n   Let's do the calculation:\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and for each of the 5 weekdays, then average.\n\n   We can extract the data:\n\n   Hour 0: \n        2016-09-06 0:00: 24.18\n        2016-09-07 0:00: 20.60\n        2016-09-08 0:00: 23.38\n        2016-09-09 0:00: 23.27\n        2016-09-12 0:00: 22.67\n        Average = (24.18+20.60+23.38+23.27+22.67)/5 = 114.1/5 = 22.82\n\n   Hour 1:\n        2016-09-06 1:00: 23.89\n        2016-09-07 1:00: 19.59\n        2016-09-08 1:00: 23.00\n        2016-09-09 1:00: 22.48\n        2016-09-12 1:00: 20.92\n        Average = (23.89+19.59+23.00+22.48+20.92)/5 = 109.88/5 = 21.976\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Let's code this in our mind.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write a small table.\n\n   But note: the data is given in chronological order. We can extract by:\n\n        Hour 0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72, 120   (because 2016-09-06 0:00 is the first, then 2016-09-07 0:00 is the 25th? Actually, the data is 0:00 at index0, then 1:00 at index1, ... 23:00 at index23, then next day 0:00 at index24, etc.)\n\n        Actually, the data is 168 hours (7 days * 24). The weekdays we want are:\n            Day0: index0 to index23 (Tuesday)\n            Day1: index24 to index47 (Wednesday)\n            Day2: index48 to index71 (Thursday)\n            Day3: index72 to index95 (Friday)\n            Skip index96 to index143 (Saturday and Sunday: 2 days * 24 = 48 hours, so from index96 to index143)\n            Day4: index144 to index167 (Monday)\n\n        So for hour h (0 to 23) in the day, we take:\n        h: index = h (Tuesday)\n        h: index = 24 + h (Wednesday)\n        h: index = 48 + h (Thursday)\n        h: index = 72 + h (Friday)\n        h: index = 144 + h (Monday)\n\n   Then average.\n\n   We'll compute the 24 averages.\n\n   Let me compute a few:\n\n   Hour 0 (h=0):\n        Tue: index0 -> 24.18\n        Wed: index24 -> 20.60\n        Thu: index48 -> 23.38\n        Fri: index72 -> 23.27\n        Mon: index144 -> 22.67\n        Avg = (24.18+20.60+23.38+23.27+22.67)/5 = 114.1/5 = 22.82\n\n   Hour 1 (h=1):\n        Tue: index1 -> 23.89\n        Wed: index25 -> 19.59\n        Thu: index49 -> 23.00\n        Fri: index73 -> 22.48\n        Mon: index145 -> 20.92\n        Avg = (23.89+19.59+23.00+22.48+20.92) = 109.88/5 = 21.976\n\n   Hour 2 (h=2):\n        Tue: 23.57\n        Wed: 18.94\n        Thu: 22.59\n        Fri: 21.84\n        Mon: 20.82\n        Avg = (23.57+18.94+22.59+21.84+20.82)/5 = 107.76/5 = 21.552\n\n   Hour 3 (h=3):\n        Tue: 22.72\n        Wed: 19.10\n        Thu: 22.13\n        Fri: 21.43\n        Mon: 20.55\n        Avg = (22.72+19.10+22.13+21.43+20.55)/5 = 105.93/5 = 21.186\n\n   Hour 4 (h=4):\n        Tue: 22.92\n        Wed: 20.21\n        Thu: 22.22\n        Fri: 21.87\n        Mon: 21.00\n        Avg = (22.92+20.21+22.22+21.87+21.00)/5 = 108.22/5 = 21.644\n\n   Hour 5 (h=5):\n        Tue: 24.13\n        Wed: 23.26\n        Thu: 23.24\n        Fri: 23.40\n        Mon: 23.27\n        Avg = (24.13+23.26+23.24+23.40+23.27)/5 = 117.3/5 = 23.46\n\n   Hour 6 (h=6):\n        Tue: 27.34\n        Wed: 25.31\n        Thu: 25.73\n        Fri: 26.14\n        Mon: 25.27\n        Avg = (27.34+25.31+25.73+26.14+25.27)/5 = 129.79/5 = 25.958\n\n   Hour 7 (h=7):\n        Tue: 29.48\n        Wed: 27.24\n        Thu: 28.33\n        Fri: 27.85\n        Mon: 27.54\n        Avg = (29.48+27.24+28.33+27.85+27.54)/5 = 140.44/5 = 28.088\n\n   Hour 8 (h=8):\n        Tue: 30.06\n        Wed: 27.74\n        Thu: 29.17\n        Fri: 27.69\n        Mon: 28.61\n        Avg = (30.06+27.74+29.17+27.69+28.61)/5 = 143.27/5 = 28.654\n\n   Hour 9 (h=9):\n        Tue: 29.96\n        Wed: 27.84\n        Thu: 29.34\n        Fri: 27.79\n        Mon: 28.62\n        Avg = (29.96+27.84+29.34+27.79+28.62)/5 = 143.55/5 = 28.71\n\n   Hour 10 (h=10):\n        Tue: 29.43\n        Wed: 26.75\n        Thu: 28.41\n        Fri: 27.97\n        Mon: 27.97   # Note: the Monday at 10:00 is 27.97?

The input data has two decimals.\n\n   Let me compute the rest:\n\n   Hour 11 (h=11):\n        Tue: 28.09\n        Wed: 26.41\n        Thu: 27.96\n        Fri: 27.84\n        Mon: 26.96\n        Avg = (28.09+26.41+27.96+27.84+26.96)/5 = 137.26/5 = 27.452\n\n   Hour 12 (h=12):\n        Tue: 26.17\n        Wed: 26.11\n        Thu: 27.68\n        Fri: 27.18\n        Mon: 26.54\n        Avg = (26.17+26.11+27.68+27.18+26.54)/5 = 133.68/5 = 26.736\n\n   Hour 13 (h=13):\n        Tue: 25.89\n        Wed: 26.07\n        Thu: 27.28\n        Fri: 26.17\n        Mon: 26.36\n        Avg = (25.89+26.07+27.28+26.17+26.36)/5 = 131.77/5 = 26.354\n\n   Hour 14 (h=14):\n        Tue: 25.73\n        Wed: 25.69\n        Thu: 26.60\n        Fri: 25.71\n        Mon: 26.06\n        Avg = (25.73+25.69+26.60+25.71+26.06)/5 = 129.79/5 = 25.958\n\n   Hour 15 (h=15):\n        Tue: 25.73\n        Wed: 25.66\n        Thu: 26.21\n        Fri: 25.73\n        Mon: 26.57\n        Avg = (25.73+25.66+26.21+25.73+26.57)/5 = 129.9/5 = 25.98\n\n   Hour 16 (h=16):\n        Tue: 26.06\n        Wed: 25.82\n        Thu: 26.20\n        Fri: 26.03\n        Mon: 27.65\n        Avg = (26.06+25.82+26.20+26.03+27.65)/5 = 131.76/5 = 26.352\n\n   Hour 17 (h=17):\n        Tue: 26.22\n        Wed: 26.94\n        Thu: 27.77\n        Fri: 26.45\n        Mon: 27.87\n        Avg = (26.22+26.94+27.77+26.45+27.87)/5 = 135.25/5 = 27.05\n\n   Hour 18 (h=18):\n        Tue: 26.35\n        Wed: 27.04\n        Thu: 28.11\n        Fri: 26.52\n        Mon: 27.91\n        Avg = (26.35+27.04+28.11+26.52+27.91)/5 = 135.93/5 = 27.186\n\n   Hour 19 (h=19):\n        Tue: 26.18\n        Wed: 27.53\n        Thu: 28.35\n        Fri: 26.60\n        Mon: 28.01\n        Avg = (26.18+27.53+28.35+26.60+28.01)/5 = 136.67/5 = 27.334\n\n   Hour 20 (h=20):\n        Tue: 26.17\n        Wed: 27.44\n        Thu: 27.95\n        Fri: 26.28\n        Mon: 27.68\n        Avg = (26.17+27.44+27.95+26.28+27.68)/5 = 135.52/5 = 27.104\n\n   Hour 21 (h=21):\n        Tue: 25.64\n        Wed: 26.69\n        Thu: 26.95\n        Fri: 25.79\n        Mon: 26.23\n        Avg = (25.64+26.69+26.95+25.79+26.23)/5 = 131.3/5 = 26.26\n\n   Hour 22 (h=22):\n        Tue: 24.22\n        Wed: 24.85\n        Thu: 24.45\n        Fri: 24.43\n        Mon: 25.14\n        Avg = (24.22+24.85+24.45+24.43+25.14)/5 = 123.09/5 = 24.618\n\n   Hour 23 (h=23):\n        Tue: 23.33\n        Wed: 24.22\n        Thu: 24.05\n        Fri: 23.79\n        Mon: 24.39\n        Avg = (23.33+24.22+24.05+23.79+24.39)/5 = 119.78/5 = 23.956\n\n   So the forecast for 2016-09-13:\n\n        0:00: 22.82\n        1:00: 21.98\n        2:00: 21.55\n        3:00: 21.19\n        4:00: 21.64\n        5:00: 23.46\n        6:00: 25.96\n        7:00: 28.09\n        8:00: 28.65\n        9:00: 28.71\n        10:00: 28.11\n        11:00: 27.45\n        12:00: 26.74\n        13:00: 26.35\n        14:00: 25.96\n        15:00: 25.98\n        16:00: 26.35\n        17:00: 27.05\n        18:00: 27.19\n        19:00: 27.33\n        20:00: 27.10\n        21:00: 26.26\n        22:00: 24.62\n        23:00: 23.96\n\n   We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the computed values might have more decimals, so we round to two.\n\n   Let me adjust the computed values to two decimals:\n\n        We'll round to two decimal places.\n\n   However, note that the average might not be exactly two decimals, so we round.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the exact value and then format to two decimals.\n\n   We'll present with two decimals.\n\n   Now, we write the answer in the required format.\n\n   The dates for the forecast: 2016/9/13 0:00 to 2016/9/13 23:00.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n          2016/9/13 0:00 22.82\n          2016/9/13 1:00 21.98\n          ... \n        </answer>\n\n   We must be careful: the hour format in the input uses a space?

This is a common baseline for time series with weekly seasonality.\n\n   We assume that the pattern of the same hour across weekdays is similar enough.\n\n   Given the data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n   Let's output.\n",
