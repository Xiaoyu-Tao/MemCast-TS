        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015/4/7 0:00 to 2015/4/13 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/4/14 0:00 to 2015/4/14 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also has grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the historical observed prices (OT). Since we don't have the future grid load and wind power forecasts, we cannot use them as features for the next 24 hours. Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can use a time series forecasting model that only requires historical prices. Common methods include:\n1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n2. Exponential Smoothing\n3. Simple moving average or naive methods\n4. More advanced models like Prophet or LSTM (but we are limited by the context and cannot run complex models here)\n\nBut note: We are in a simulated environment and must provide an answer without the ability to run code. Therefore, we need a simple and reasonable approach.\n\nGiven the data, we observe:\n- The data has a daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with prices typically lower at night and higher during the day, especially in the morning and evening peaks.\n- There is also a weekly pattern: weekdays (like 4/7 to 4/10) have higher prices than the weekend (4/11 and 4/12). Then 4/13 (Monday) shows a return to higher prices.\n\nSince we are forecasting for 2015/4/14 (which is a Tuesday), we can expect a pattern similar to the previous weekdays (like 4/7, 4/8, 4/9, 4/10, and 4/13).\n\nApproach:\n1. We note that the data for 4/13 (Monday) is the most recent weekday and might be the most relevant.\n2. However, to capture the typical Tuesday pattern, we can look at the same hour of the previous Tuesday (which is 4/7) and adjust for the recent trend.\n\nBut note: 4/7 was a Tuesday and 4/14 is also a Tuesday. We can use the same day of the previous week as a base and then adjust by the recent day-over-day change.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for the last few weekdays (excluding the weekend) and then adjust by the trend from the last day.\n\nHowever, we have only one week of data. So we have only one previous Tuesday (4/7) and then the Monday (4/13) which is the day before.\n\nA simple method:\n- Use the values from the same day of the previous week (i.e., 4/7) and adjust by the ratio (or difference) of the last day (4/13) to the same day a week before (4/6, which we don't have). \n\nBut we don't have 4/6. So we can do:\n\nOption 1: Use the previous day (4/13) as the base and then add the difference between the previous Tuesday (4/7) and the Tuesday a week before that (which we don't have). This is not feasible.\n\nOption 2: Since we have the entire week, we can compute the average daily profile for weekdays (Tuesday to Friday and Monday) and then use that for the next day. But note that 4/13 was a Monday and 4/14 is a Tuesday. We can compute the average_hourly_profile for the weekdays we have (4/7, 4/8, 4/9, 4/10, 4/13) and then use that for 4/14.\n\nBut we must account for the fact that the overall level of prices might be changing. We can scale the average profile by the ratio of the last day's average to the average of the same weekdays.\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract the weekdays: \n   - Tuesday (4/7), Wednesday (4/8), Thursday (4/9), Friday (4/10), Monday (4/13). Note: we skip the weekend (4/11, 4/12).\n2. For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average price for that hour over these 5 days.\n3. Compute the average price for the entire last day (4/13) and the average of the entire set of weekdays (all hours of the 5 days).\n4. Then, the forecast for hour h on 4/14 = (average_hour_h) * (average_price_4_13 / overall_weekday_average)\n\nAlternatively, we can use a multiplicative adjustment: \n   forecast_h = (average_hour_h) * (average_price_4_13 / overall_weekday_average)\n\nBut note: the overall_weekday_average is the average of all the 5*24=120 data points, and average_price_4_13 is the average of the 24 hours of 4/13.\n\nHowever, we can also do an additive adjustment, but multiplicative is more common for seasonal patterns.\n\nBut let's check: the data on 4/13 has a different level than the previous week? \n\nWe can compute the average for 4/13: \n  25.06 (0:00) ... to 25.06 (23:00) -> we can compute the average.\n\nBut we don't have to do exact calculations? We are to provide a forecast.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a naive method: use the previous day (4/13) as the base and then adjust each hour by the difference between the previous Tuesday (4/7) and the average of the weekdays for that hour? \n\nBut we are limited by the fact that we are doing this manually.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are to provide 24 numbers, we can compute the average profile for the weekdays and then adjust by the ratio of the last day's average to the average of the entire weekday history.\n\nBut note: the problem says to handle missing values. In the provided data, there are no missing values? So we don't have to handle any.\n\nLet me compute the average for each hour of the weekday:\n\nHour 0: (25.20 (4/7) + 24.27 (4/8) + 25.09 (4/9) + 25.06 (4/10) + 20.62 (4/13)) / 5 = (25.20+24.27+25.09+25.06+20.62)/5 = 120.24/5 = 24.048\nBut wait, 4/13 at 0:00 is 20.62? That is an outlier? Actually, 4/13 is a Monday and we see that the night prices are lower. But 20.62 is much lower than the previous week's Tues-Fri. So including 4/13 might bring down the average.\n\nAlternatively, we can use only the same day of the week? i.e., only Tuesday (4/7) and then adjust by the trend from the last day? \n\nBut we have only one Tuesday.\n\nGiven the complexity, a simpler approach: use the previous day (4/13) as the forecast? But that would ignore the weekly pattern. For example, 4/13 was a Monday and 4/14 is a Tuesday. Typically, Tuesdays might have a slightly different pattern.\n\nBut looking at the data, the pattern on 4/7 (Tuesday) and 4/13 (Monday) are somewhat comparable? \n\nAlternatively, we can take the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays that are the same day of the week? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nforecast for 4/14 hour h = (price of 4/13 hour h) * (price of 4/7 hour h / price of 4/6 hour h)\n\nBut we don't have 4/6.\n\nAnother idea: use the average of the same hour for the last three days (4/11, 4/12, 4/13) and then adjust for the day of the week? But 4/11 and 4/12 are weekend and have a different pattern.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I propose:\n\n1. We will use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays that are not weekend: that is 4/10 (Friday) and 4/13 (Monday). Then adjust for the fact that we are forecasting a Tuesday by using the ratio of the previous Tuesday (4/7) to the average of the Monday and Friday of that week? But we don't have the Friday of the previous week? We have 4/3? No.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: \n   forecast_h = (price_{4/13, h} + price_{4/10, h}) / 2   [but that would be for Tuesday?]\n\nBut that would be the average of Monday and Friday, which might not be representative for Tuesday.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we are to provide an answer, I will use the following:\n\nWe note that the pattern on 4/13 (Monday) is similar to the pattern on 4/6 (which we don't have) and the pattern on 4/7 (Tuesday) is what we want. But we don't have 4/6.\n\nSo I will use the previous day (4/13) as the base and then adjust each hour by the difference between the previous Tuesday (4/7) and the previous Monday (4/6) but we don't have 4/6.\n\nTherefore, I will use a different approach: \n\nCompute the average daily price for each weekday we have:\n   4/7 (Tue): average = (25.20+24.89+...+25.10)/24 -> we can compute\n   4/8 (Wed): ... \n   4/9 (Thu): ...\n   4/10 (Fri): ...\n   4/13 (Mon): ...\n\nThen for each hour, we have 5 values. We can take the median or mean. But the mean might be affected by the low Monday night prices.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the median for each hour to avoid outliers.\n\nBut without the ability to compute exactly, and since we must provide 24 numbers, I will use the following pragmatic approach:\n\n- For each hour, take the average of the weekdays excluding the lowest and highest? or just use the mean of the 5 weekdays.\n\nBut note: the data for 4/13 at night is lower than the others, so it will pull down the average for the night hours.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the median for each hour. But again, we have to compute 24 medians manually? That's tedious.\n\nGiven the instructions, I will provide a forecast based on the following:\n\nWe will use the values from the same day of the previous week (4/7) and then adjust by the overall change observed in the last day (4/13) relative to the same day a week ago (4/6) but we don't have 4/6.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nAnother idea: use the average of the last 7 days for each hour? But we only have 7 days, and the weekend is different.\n\nGiven the time, I will use the following simple method:\n\n   forecast = (price of the same hour on the previous day) * (price of the same hour on the previous Tuesday) / (price of the same hour on the previous Monday)\n\nBut we don't have the previous Monday (4/6). \n\nTherefore, I will use the average of the last 24 hours (4/13) as the base and then adjust each hour by the typical Tuesday factor relative to Monday, but we don't have the factor.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume that the Tuesday profile is similar to the Monday profile but with a slight increase during peak hours? \n\nLooking at the data:\n\nOn 4/7 (Tue) vs 4/6 (which we don't have) and 4/13 (Mon) we cannot compare.\n\nGiven the complexity, I must provide an answer, so I will use the following:\n\n   For each hour h, forecast_h = (price_{4/13, h} + price_{4/7, h}) / 2\n\nThis combines the most recent day (Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). This might capture both the recent level and the Tuesday pattern.\n\nLet's test for hour 0: \n   (20.62 + 25.20 ) / 2 = 22.91\n\nBut is that reasonable? The price on 4/13 at 0:00 was 20.62 and on 4/7 at 0:00 was 25.20. The average is 22.91.\n\nSimilarly, for hour 7: \n   4/13 at 7:00: 25.89, 4/7 at 7:00: 26.78 -> average = 26.335\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nBut note: the weekend in between might have changed the level. This method might be simple and better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, we could use exponential smoothing, but we don't have the capacity to optimize alpha.\n\nSo I will go with: \n   forecast for 2015/4/14 h:00 = (price on 2015/4/13 h:00 + price on 2015/4/7 h:00) / 2\n\nBut note: 4/7 is 7 days before 4/14, and 4/13 is the day before.\n\nLet me compute the forecast for the 24 hours:\n\n0:00: (20.62 + 25.20) / 2 = 22.91\n1:00: (20.26 + 24.89) / 2 = 22.575\n2:00: (18.91 + 24.69) / 2 = 21.80\n3:00: (18.60 + 24.67) / 2 = 21.635\n4:00: (20.12 + 24.71) / 2 = 22.415\n5:00: (22.60 + 25.21) / 2 = 23.905\n6:00: (25.00 + 26.17) / 2 = 25.585\n7:00: (25.89 + 26.78) / 2 = 26.335\n8:00: (25.99 + 27.66) / 2 = 26.825\n9:00: (25.81 + 27.72) / 2 = 26.765\n10:00: (25.54 + 27.32) / 2 = 26.43\n11:00: (25.24 + 27.18) / 2 = 26.21\n12:00: (24.95 + 26.47) / 2 = 25.71\n13:00: (24.84 + 26.35) / 2 = 25.595\n14:00: (24.59 + 26.01) / 2 = 25.30\n15:00: (24.54 + 26.03) / 2 = 25.285\n16:00: (24.73 + 26.06) / 2 = 25.395\n17:00: (25.05 + 26.18) / 2 = 25.615\n18:00: (25.23 + 26.37) / 2 = 25.80\n19:00: (25.59 + 26.55) / 2 = 26.07\n20:00: (25.92 + 26.43) / 2 = 26.175\n21:00: (25.90 + 26.25) / 2 = 26.075\n22:00: (25.42 + 25.71) / 2 = 25.565\n23:00: (25.06 + 25.10) / 2 = 25.08\n\nBut wait, the last value for 4/13 23:00 is 25.06 and for 4/7 23:00 is 25.10.\n\nThis method might be acceptable.\n\nHowever, note that the prices on 4/13 were generally lower than on 4/7, so the forecast will be in between.\n\nBut is there a better way? We could also consider the overall trend. The prices on 4/13 are lower than 4/7, so maybe we should give more weight to 4/13? \n\nAlternatively, we could do a weighted average: \n   weight for 4/13 = 0.7, weight for 4/7 = 0.3\n\nBut without a rigorous way to choose weights, we stick to 0.5.\n\nGiven the instructions, I will output the above values.\n\nThe forecast for 2015/4/14 0:00 to 23:00:\n\n0:00: 22.91\n1:00: 22.575 -> 22.58 (rounded to two decimals as in the input)\n2:00: 21.80\n3:00: 21.635 -> 21.64\n4:00: 22.415 -> 22.42\n5:00: 23.905 -> 23.91\n6:00: 25.585 -> 25.59\n7:00: 26.335 -> 26.34\n8:00: 26.825 -> 26.83\n9:00: 26.765 -> 26.77\n10:00: 26.43\n11:00: 26.21\n12:00: 25.71\n13:00: 25.595 -> 25.60\n14:00: 25.30\n15:00: 25.285 -> 25.29\n16:00: 25.395 -> 25.40\n17:00: 25.615 -> 25.62\n18:00: 25.80\n19:00: 26.07\n20:00: 26.175 -> 26.18\n21:00: 26.075 -> 26.08\n22:00: 25.565 -> 25.57\n23:00: 25.08\n\nBut note: the input data has two decimal places, so we output two decimals.\n\nHowever, this is a simple method and might not be the most accurate, but given the constraints, it is a reasonable approach.\n\nLet's write the forecast in the required format.\n",
