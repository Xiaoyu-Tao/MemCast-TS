        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/8/5 0:00 to 2014/8/11 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/8/12 0:00 to 2014/8/12 23:00.\n\n However, note that the data has a clear daily pattern and also a weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends). The last day in the data is 2014/8/11, which is a Monday. The next day, 2014/8/12, is a Tuesday.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: In the provided data, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed price) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast the next 24 hours, we can use a model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - Weekly seasonality (168 hours)\n\n However, note that the data provided is exactly 168 hours (7 days). We can use a seasonal naive approach, but we can also try to capture the trend and seasonality.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables, we can use:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (but we don't have a long series)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (with daily and weekly seasonality) but 7 days might be too short for weekly seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the same pattern as the previous day (Monday, 2014/8/11) and adjust for the day of the week? But note that 2014/8/11 was a Monday and 2014/8/12 is a Tuesday. So we might look at the previous Tuesday (2014/8/5) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n However, note that the data from 2014/8/5 (Tuesday) to 2014/8/11 (Monday) shows a general pattern in the week. We can compute the average daily profile for weekdays and then adjust for the specific day.\n\n But let's look at the data:\n\n   Weekday of 2014/8/5: Tuesday\n   Weekday of2014/8/6: Wednesday\n   Weekday of2014/8/7: Thursday\n   Weekday of2014/8/8: Friday\n   Weekday of2014/8/9: Saturday\n   Weekday of2014/8/10: Sunday\n   Weekday of2014/8/11: Monday\n\n We are to forecast Tuesday (2014/8/12). We have one previous Tuesday (2014/8/5) and also the recent Monday (2014/8/11) and the trend from the last week.\n\n However, note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) have a different pattern (lower prices). The weekdays (Monday to Friday) have a similar pattern but with variations.\n\n Since we have only one week of data, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Use the previous Tuesday (2014/8/5) as the forecast for 2014/8/12. But that ignores any trend.\n\n   Option 2: Compute the average of the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday and Monday) for each hour and then use that as the profile for Tuesday. But note that Monday and Tuesday are adjacent and might be similar.\n\n   Option 3: Use the most recent day (Monday, 2014/8/11) and adjust by the difference between the previous Monday (2014/8/4 is not provided) and Tuesday (2014/8/5). But we don't have 2014/8/4.\n\n   We only have from 2014/8/5 to 2014/8/11. So we have one full week of weekdays and one weekend.\n\n   Actually, we have:\n        Tuesday (8/5), Wednesday (8/6), Thursday (8/7), Friday (8/8), Saturday (8/9), Sunday (8/10), Monday (8/11)\n\n   We are missing the previous Monday (8/4) and the next Tuesday (8/12) is to be forecasted.\n\n   We can compute the average of the weekdays (excluding weekend) for each hour. The weekdays in the data: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday.\n\n   But note: Monday is the day before Tuesday, so we can use the average of the five weekdays for each hour to form a typical weekday profile.\n\n   However, the weekdays in the data are not all the same. We can see a trend: the prices on Monday (8/11) are generally lower than Tuesday (8/5) in the same hours? Let's compare:\n\n        Hour 0:00: 8/5: 29.59, 8/11: 26.45 -> lower\n        Hour 1:00: 29.28 vs 23.80 -> lower\n        ... but then during the day on 8/11, the prices are also lower.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement for a quick forecast, I propose:\n\n   We use the average of the same hour of the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) for the 24 hours.\n\n   But note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included in the average for the weekdays.\n\n   Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n        Let H0 (0:00): average of 8/5 0:00, 8/6 0:00, 8/7 0:00, 8/8 0:00, 8/11 0:00\n        ... and so on.\n\n   However, we note that the last day (Monday 8/11) has a very low night price. This might be an outlier? But we have to use it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since we are not given any other information, we will use a simple average of the five weekdays for each hour.\n\n   But note: the data for 8/11 (Monday) is the most recent and might be more indicative. However, without a clear trend model, we stick to average.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (29.59 + 29.89 + 29.84 + 30.00 + 26.45) / 5 = (29.77) -> 29.77? Actually: \n            29.59 (8/5), 29.89 (8/6), 29.84 (8/7), 30.00 (8/8), 26.45 (8/11) -> sum=145.77 -> 145.77/5 = 29.154\n\n        Similarly for each hour.\n\n   However, we must note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included. This average is for weekdays.\n\n   But the day we are forecasting (Tuesday) is a weekday, so this is appropriate.\n\n   But wait: the average for hour 0:00 is 29.154, but the last Monday (8/11) was 26.45 which is much lower. This might be because of a downward trend? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the same day last week? \n\n   However, the problem specifying the method, and we are an expert, we can choose a method that we think is best.\n\n   Considering the short history and the fact that we have only one week, I will use the average of the same weekday (Tuesday) from the previous week and the most recent day (Monday) adjusted by the typical difference between Monday and Tuesday? But we don't have two weeks.\n\n   Therefore, I will use the average of the five weekdays for each hour as the forecast for the next Tuesday.\n\n   But note: the last Monday (8/11) is included and it is the most recent, so it might want to give it more weight? However, without a clear trend, we use equal weights.\n\n   Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We have 5 weekdays: \n         2014-08-05 (Tuesday)\n         2014-08-06 (Wednesday)\n         2014-08-07 (Thursday)\n         2014-08-08 (Friday)\n         2014-08-11 (Monday)\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23) we average the values of these 5 days at that hour.\n\n   However, note that the days are not consecutive in the week? But we are treating all weekdays the same.\n\n   We'll compute:\n\n        hour0 = (29.59, 29.89, 29.84, 30.00, 26.45) -> average = (29.59+29.89+29.84+30.00+26.45)/5 = 145.77/5 = 29.154\n        hour1 = (29.28, 29.55, 29.46, 29.69, 23.80) -> (29.28+29.55+29.46+29.69+23.80) = 141.78/5 = 28.356\n        ... and so on.\n\n   But wait, the hour1 on 8/11 is 23.80 which is very low. This might be an anomaly? But we have to include it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But the problem does not specify.\n\n   Since the problem says \"handle missing values\", but there are no missing values, and we are not told about outliers, we use mean.\n\n   However, note that the price on 8/11 (Monday) is unusually low at night. This might be due to a change in the market? But without more data, we cannot know.\n\n   We'll proceed with the mean.\n\n   We'll calculate the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n   But note: the data for 8/11 is the most recent and might be more relevant. We could use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? For example, linear weights: [1,2,3,4,5] for [8/5, 8/6, 8/7, 8/8, 8/11] (with 8/11 being the most recent and getting weight 5). \n\n   Let me try with weights: \n        weight = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> total weight = 15\n\n        hour0: (29.59*1 + 29.89*2 + 29.84*3 + 30.00*4 + 26.45*5) / 15 \n               = (29.59 + 59.78 + 89.52 + 120.0 + 132.25) / 15 = 431.14 / 15 = 28.7427\n\n   This gives more weight to the last Monday (26.45) and pulls the average down.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing? But we are at the end of the series and we want to forecast 24 hours.\n\n   Given the time, I will use the weighted average with linear weights (with the most recent day having the highest weight) because it gives more importance to the recent pattern.\n\n   Weights: \n        Day 2014-08-05 (Tuesday): weight=1\n        Day 2014-08-06 (Wednesday): weight=2\n        Day 2014-08-07 (Thursday): weight=3\n        Day 2014-08-08 (Friday): weight=4\n        Day 2014-08-11 (Monday): weight=5\n\n   Total weight = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.\n\n   We'll compute for each hour.\n\n   Let's do the first two:\n\n        Hour0: \n            Tue: 29.59 * 1 = 29.59\n            Wed: 29.89 * 2 = 59.78\n            Thu: 29.84 * 3 = 89.52\n            Fri: 30.00 * 4 = 120.00\n            Mon: 26.45 * 5 = 132.25\n            Sum = 29.59+59.78+89.52+120.00+132.25 = 431.14\n            Avg = 431.14 / 15 = 28.742666... -> 28.74\n\n        Hour1:\n            Tue: 29.28 * 1 = 29.28\n            Wed: 29.55 * 2 = 59.10\n            Thu: 29.46 * 3 = 88.38\n            Fri: 29.69 * 4 = 118.76\n            Mon: 23.80 * 5 = 119.00\n            Sum = 29.28+59.10+88.38+118.76+119.00 = 414.52\n            Avg = 414.52 / 15 = 27.634666... -> 27.63\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   But note: the day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, and the Monday is the day before. The pattern of Monday might be different from Tuesday? However, we don't have a Tuesday in the recent days except the one a week ago. So we are using the Monday to Friday and the Monday to forecast Tuesday.\n\n   This might not be perfect, but it's a reasonable approach.\n\n   Alternatively, we could use the average of the previous Tuesday and the Monday, but with more weight on Monday?
