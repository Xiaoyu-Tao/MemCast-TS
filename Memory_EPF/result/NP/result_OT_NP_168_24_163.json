        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/2/16 0:00 to 2016/2/22 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016/2/23 0:00 to 2016/2/23 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed electricity price) and the date. We are not given the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts, so we cannot use them. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only using the historical prices, we can use a time series model. Given the data shows daily seasonality (patterns repeating every 24 hours) and also weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends), we can consider a model that captures these.\n\n However, note that the problem requires a forecast for the next 24 hours. We are in a short-term forecasting setting.\n\n Given the constraints, we are not allowed to use external data and we must provide the forecast for the next 24 hours.\n\n We can use a simple method: \n   - Use the average of the same hour of the previous days (e.g., average of the 0:00 hour from the last 7 days for the next 0:00) but adjusted for weekly patterns? \n   - But note: the data includes weekdays and weekends. The last day in the data is Monday (2016/2/22). The next day is Tuesday (2016/2/23). \n\n Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model or an ARIMA model. However, without the ability to run complex model fitting in this environment, we need a simple and robust method.\n\n Proposed method: \n   We note that the data has:\n     - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n     - Weekly seasonality (7 days)\n\n   We can see that weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices during the day (especially morning and evening peaks) and weekends have lower and flatter prices.\n\n   Since we are forecasting a Tuesday (2016/2/23), we can look at the previous Tuesday (2016/2/16) and also the recent days (Monday, Sunday, etc.) but with more weight on the same day of the week.\n\n   However, we have only one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days: \n        Day 0: Tuesday (2016/2/16)\n        Day 1: Wednesday (2016/2/17)\n        Day 2: Thursday (2016/2/18)\n        Day 3: Friday (2016/2/19)\n        Day 4: Saturday (2016/2/20)\n        Day 5: Sunday (2016/2/21)\n        Day 6: Monday (2016/2/22)\n\n   We are forecasting the next day: Tuesday (2016/2/23) which is the same as Day 0 (the first day in our data) but one week later.\n\n   We can we do?\n   Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (2016/2/16) as the forecast. But that might not capture recent trends.\n\n   Option 2: Use a weighted average of the same hour over the last few days, with more weight on the same day of the previous week and also the most recent days.\n\n   We can use:\n        Forecast for hour h (on Tuesday) = \n            (w1 * Price of hour h on the previous Tuesday (2016/2/16) \n             + w2 * Price of hour h on the most recent day (Monday 2016/2/22) \n             + w3 * Price of hour h on the day before that (Sunday 2016/2/21) \n             ... ) / (w1 + w2 + w3 + ...)\n\n   But how to set weights? We can give higher weight to the same day of the previous week and also to the most recent day.\n\n   However, note that the pattern on Monday (2016/2/22) was different from Tuesday (2016/2/16) because Monday is a weekday and the previous Tuesday is also a weekday, but the next Tuesday might be similar to the previous Tuesday? But we have only one Tuesday in the data.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for all the weekdays in the past week? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n   Given the simplicity, we have to use a method that does not require fitting, we can do:\n\n        For each hour h in [0,23]:\n            Let F_h = (2 * price of hour h on the previous Tuesday (2016/2/16) \n                       + 1 * price of hour h on Monday (2016/2/22) \n                       + 1 * price of hour h on Sunday (2016/2/21) \n                       + 1 * price of hour h on Saturday (2016/2/20) \n                       + 1 * price of hour h on Friday (2016/2/19) \n                       + 1 * price of hour h on Thursday (2016/2/18) \n                       + 1 * price of hour h on Wednesday (2016/2/17)) \n                     / (2+1+1+1+1+1+1) \n            = (2 * Tues_old + average of the last 6 days) / 8? Actually, we have 7 days but we double the Tuesday.\n\n        But note: we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we put more weight on the same day of the previous week.\n\n   However, we can also consider that the most recent day (Monday) is a weekday and might be more similar to the coming Tuesday than the weekend days. So we can adjust weights:\n\n        Weights: \n            Previous Tuesday (same day of the week): 3\n            Monday (the day before): 2\n            Other weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday): 1\n            Weekend days (Saturday, Sunday): 0.5\n\n        Then for each hour h:\n            F_h = (3 * Tues_old_h + 2 * Mon_h + Wed_h + Thu_h + Fri_h + 0.5 * Sat_h + 0.5 * Sun_h) / (3+2+1+1+1+0.5+0.5) = (3*Tues_old_h + 2*Mon_h + Wed_h + Thu_h + Fri_h + 0.5*Sat_h + 0.5*Sun_h) / 9\n\n   But note: we have only one week of data, so we have only one of each.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days, but that would be the same as the average without weights.\n\n   Let me look at the data: \n        The prices on Tuesday (2016/2/16) were generally higher than the Monday (2016/2/22). For example, at 7:00: \n            Tuesday (2/16): 38.73\n            Monday (2/22): 20.17\n\n        So if we use the previous Tuesday as a strong indicator, we might get a higher forecast.\n\n   However, we must also note that the prices on the last two days (Sunday and Monday) were lower than the same day the previous week. There might be a downward trend? \n\n   But without more data, it's hard to capture trend. \n\n   Considering the above, I propose to use a weighted average with more weight on the same day of the previous week and the most recent day. \n\n   Weights:\n        Previous Tuesday (2016/2/16): 4\n        Monday (2016/2/22): 3\n        Sunday (2016/2/21): 1\n        Saturday (2016/2/20): 1\n        Friday (2016/2/19): 1\n        Thursday (2016/2/18): 1\n        Wednesday (2016/2/17): 1\n\n        Total weight = 4+3+1+1+1+1+1 = 12\n\n   Then for each hour h (0 to 23):\n        F_h = (4 * Tues_old_h + 3 * Mon_h + Sun_h + Sat_h + Fri_h + Thu_h + Wed_h) / 12\n\n   But note: the weekend days (Sat, Sun) might have a different pattern? We are forecasting a Tuesday, so we might want to give less weight to weekends? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use only weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday and one Monday, and then the other weekdays. \n\n   Let me try with only weekdays? But then we have 5 weekdays: \n        Weights: \n            Tuesday (old): 4\n            Monday: 3\n            Friday: 2\n            Thursday: 2\n            Wednesday: 2\n        Total = 4+3+2+2+2 = 13\n\n   But we are excluding weekends? However, the weekend data might still be useful? \n\n   Given the data shows that weekends are lower, and we are forecasting a weekday, we might not want to pull the average down by including weekends? \n\n   We can try two approaches and compare? But we have to choose one.\n\n   After looking at the data, the prices on the last Saturday and Sunday were very low, and the Monday was also relatively low compared to the previous Tuesday. \n\n   Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was a typical weekday with higher prices, but the recent trend is lower, we might compromise.\n\n   I will use the first approach: including all days with weights: \n        Tuesday (old): 4, Monday: 3, and the rest 1.\n\n   Let's compute for one hour to see: hour 7:00):\n\n        Tues_old (2/16 7:00): 38.73\n        Mon (2/22 7:00): 20.17\n        Sun (2/21 7:00): 15.73\n        Sat (2/20 7:00): 15.59\n        Fri (2/19 7:00): 29.88\n        Thu (2/18 7:00): 34.69\n        Wed (2/17 7:00): 20.76\n\n        F_7 = (4*38.73 + 3*20.17 + 15.73 + 15.59 + 29.88 + 34.69 + 20.76) / 12\n            = (154.92 + 60.51 + 15.73+15.59+29.88+34.69+20.76) / 12\n            = 332.08 / 12 = 27.6733\n\n   This seems reasonable? \n\n   But note: the previous Tuesday had a spike at 7:00, but the recent Monday was only 20.17. The average comes to 27.67, which is in between.\n\n   We can do the same for every hour.\n\n   However, we must note that the data for the last Monday (2016/2/22) was a full day of relatively low prices (around 20) compared to the previous Tuesday (which had a spike to 38). \n\n   The forecasted Tuesday might be a mix of the previous Tuesday and the recent Monday? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But we have only two weekdays: the previous Tuesday and the Monday? \n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we have to do 24 hours, we'll use the weighted average as above.\n\n   Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n        Let h be the hour (0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00)\n\n        Let d0 = 2016/2/16 (Tuesday) -> index: row 0 to 23: for hour h, it's row h (if we start at 0:00 as row0)\n        d1 = 2016/2/17 (Wednesday) -> row 24 to 47: for hour h, row 24+h\n        d2 = 2016/2/18 (Thursday) -> row 48 to 71: for hour h, row 48+h\n        d3 = 2016/2/19 (Friday) -> row 72 to 95: for hour h, row 72+h\n        d4 = 2016/2/20 (Saturday) -> row 96 to 119: for hour h, row 96+h\n        d5 = 2016/2/21 (Sunday) -> row 120 to 143: for hour h, row 120+h\n        d6 = 2016/2/22 (Monday) -> row 144 to 167: for hour h, row 144+h\n\n        Then for hour h in the forecast (for 2016/2/23), we take:\n\n        F_h = (4 * OT[d0: h] + 3 * OT[d6: h] + OT[d1: h] + OT[d2: h] + OT[d3: h] + OT[d4: h] + OT[d5: h]) / 12\n\n   But note: the data we are given is in order, so we can index by the row.\n\n   We have 168 rows (0 to 167). \n\n        d0: h -> row h (for h in 0..23)\n        d1: h -> row 24+h\n        d2: h -> row 48+h\n        d3: h -> row 72+h\n        d4: h -> row 96+h\n        d5: h -> row 120+h\n        d6: h -> row 144+h\n\n   We'll compute for each h from 0 to 23.\n\n   However, note: the data we are given starts at 2016/2/16 0:00 (row0) and ends at 2016/2/22 23:00 (row167).\n\n   We'll compute the forecast for 2016/2/23 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n   Let's do one more example: hour 0 (0:00)\n\n        d0: 2016/2/16 0:00 -> row0: 18.22\n        d1: 2016/2/17 0:00 -> row24: 17.42\n        d2: 2016/2/18 0:00 -> row48: 18.00\n        d3: 2016/2/19 0:00 -> row72: 18.49\n        d4: 2016/2/20 0:00 -> row96: 17.62\n        d5: 2016/2/21 0:00 -> row120: 15.60\n        d6: 2016/2/22 0:00 -> row144: 16.27\n\n        F_0 = (4*18.22 + 3*16.27 + 17.42 + 18.00 + 18.49 + 17.62 + 15.60) / 12\n            = (72.88 + 48.81 + 17.42+18.00+18.49+17.62+15.60) / 12\n            = 208.82 / 12 = 17.401666... -> 17.40\n\n   This seems reasonable.\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   But note: we must round to two decimals? The input data has two decimals.\n\n   We'll round to two decimal places.\n\n   Let's code this in the answer.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"handle missing values\", but we don't have any. So we are safe.\n\n   We'll generate the forecast for the next 24 hours (2016/2/23 0:00 to 2016/2/23 23:00) with the above method.\n\n   The dates for the forecast are:\n\n        2016/2/23 0:00\n        2016/2/23 1:00\n        ...\n        2016/2/23 23:00\n\n   We'll output in the same format: \n        \"YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM forecasted_price\"\n\n   But note: the input format for date is inconsistent: \n        They used: \"2016/2/16 0:00\" (with single digit for month and day and hour without leading zero for hour? Actually, the hour is 0:00, 1:00, ... 9:00, 10:00, etc.)\n\n   We'll output the date in the same format: \n        For the day: 2016/2/23 (February 23, 2016) -> we write as \"2016/2/23\"\n        For the hour: we write \"0:00\", \"1:00\", ... \"23:00\"\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        2016/2/23 0:00 17.40\n        2016/2/23 1:00 ... \n\n   Let's compute all 24 hours.\n\n   We'll create a list for the 24 forecasted hours.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        h = 0 to 23:\n\n        d0_index = h\n        d1_index = 24 + h\n        d2_index = 48 + h\n        d3_index = 72 + h\n        d4_index = 96 + h\n        d5_index = 120 + h\n        d6_index = 144 + h\n\n        F_h = (4 * data[d0_index] + 3 * data[d6_index] + data[d1_index] + data[d2_index] + data[d3_index] + data[d4_index] + data[d5_index]) / 12.0\n\n        Then round to two decimals.\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Note: the data is given as a list of 168 rows. We can index by row number.\n\n   We'll parse the data: the 'OT' column is the price.\n\n   We have the data in the following order (0 to 167):\n\n        row0: 2016/2/16 0:00 -> 18.22\n        row1: 2016/2/16 1:00 -> 18.14\n        ...\n        row23: 2016/2/16 23:00 -> 17.54\n        row24: 2016/2/17 0:00 -> 17.42\n        ...\n        row167: 2016/2/22 23:00 -> 17.70\n\n   We'll create an array of the OT values.\n\n   Let me write the array (for reference):\n\n        data = [\n            18.22, 18.14, 18.09, 18.26, 18.65, 19.15, 24.01, 38.73, 42.30, 42.82, 37.31, 37.07, 31.26, 30.39,
