        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/8/23 0:00 to 2016/8/29 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2016/8/30 0:00 to 2016/8/30 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical price.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours). There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows:\n    - Daily pattern: prices are lower at night and early morning, then rise during the day, peaking in the morning and sometimes in the evening.\n    - Weekly pattern: weekdays (Monday to Friday) typically have higher prices than weekends.\n\n 3. Since we are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends. Given the short-term forecast (24 hours), we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day or same day of the previous week.\n    - However, we note that the data ends on a Monday (2016/8/29) and we are forecasting a Tuesday (2016/8/30). So we can look at the same day of the previous week (2016/8/23, which was a Tuesday) and also consider the recent daily patterns.\n\n 4. Considering the limitations, a simple and effective method is to use a seasonal naive model with a weekly seasonality. But note that the data from the same day of the previous week (2016/8/23) is 7 days ago. However, we also see that the pattern might have changed slightly.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an autoregressive model or exponential smoothing. But without the ability to run complex models, we can use a weighted average of the last few days and the same day of the previous week.\n\n 6. Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last three days (Sunday, Monday) and the same hour of the previous Tuesday (2016/8/23) to account for weekly seasonality. However, since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n    - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016/8/23) and the same hour from the last two days (Monday and Sunday) and then take an average.\n\n 7. But note: the data for the last two days (Sunday and Monday) might be more similar to the upcoming Tuesday than the previous Tuesday? However, we don't have a long history. We have exactly one week of data.\n\n 8. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we can do:\n    - For each hour (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2016/8/30), we take the average of:\n        a) The same hour from the same day of the previous week (2016/8/23, which is Tuesday)\n        b) The same hour from the day before the forecast (Monday, 2016/8/29)\n        c) The same hour from two days before (Sunday, 2016/8/28)\n\n    Why? Because the immediate past (Monday and Sunday) might capture the recent trend, and the same day last week captures the weekly pattern.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days. For example:\n      forecast = (0.5 * same hour last Monday + 0.3 * same hour last Sunday + 0.2 * same hour last Tuesday)\n\n 10. However, note that the last Monday (2016/8/29) is the day immediately before the forecast day, and the last Tuesday (2016/8/23) is a week ago. We might want to give more weight to the most recent day.\n\n 11. Let's try a simple average first and then adjust if we see a trend? But without additional information, we stick to a simple method.\n\n 12. Considering the data shows a slight downward trend in the last week? Let's compare the same hour on consecutive days:\n\n      For hour 0:00:\n        2016/8/23 (Tue): 22.43\n        2016/8/24 (Wed): 23.75\n        2016/8/25 (Thu): 22.14\n        2016/8/26 (Fri): 22.74\n        2016/8/27 (Sat): 23.31\n        2016/8/28 (Sun): 22.44\n        2016/8/29 (Mon): 21.87\n\n      There is no clear trend, but we see fluctuations.\n\n 13. We decide to use the average of the same hour from the last Monday (2016/8/29) and the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016/8/23) and the same hour from the last Sunday (2016/8/28). Why Sunday? Because it's the same type of day (weekend) but closer in time? Actually, Tuesday is a weekday and Sunday is a weekend. So we might not include Sunday? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But we only have one previous Tuesday and the Monday and Friday? \n\n 15. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n     - The previous Tuesday (2016/8/23) and the last two weekdays: Monday (2016/8/29) and Friday (2016/8/26). But note Friday is a weekday and might be similar? However, Friday is the last weekday before the weekend.\n\n 16. Actually, the data for Friday (2016/8/26) is a weekday, but it is followed by the weekend. The Monday (2016/8/29) is the start of the week and the Tuesday we are forecasting is the next day.\n\n 17. We decide to use the average of:\n      - The same hour on the previous Tuesday (2016/8/23)\n      - The same hour on the previous Monday (2016/8/29) [the day before]\n      - The same hour on the previous Wednesday (2016/8/24) [to get another weekday from the same week?]\n\n 18. But note: we don't have the Wednesday of the same week? We have the Wednesday of the previous week? Actually, we have:\n        Tuesday: 2016/8/23\n        Wednesday: 2016/8/24\n        Thursday: 2016/8/25\n        Friday: 2016/8/26\n        Saturday: 2016/8/27\n        Sunday: 2016/8/28\n        Monday: 2016/8/29\n\n 19. We are missing the Wednesday of the current week? Actually, the current week we are in is the Monday (2016/8/29) and we are forecasting Tuesday (2016/8/30). So the previous Wednesday is 2016/8/24 (which is 6 days before the forecast day). \n\n 20. We can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays: Monday (2016/8/29), Friday (2016/8/26), and Thursday (2016/8/25). But these are not the same day of the week.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two Mondays? But we only have one Monday.\n\n 22. Given the complexity, we are going to use a simple method: use the same hour from the day before (Monday, 2016/8/29) and the same hour from the same day last week (Tuesday, 2016/8/23) and take the average.\n\n 23. We'll do: \n        forecast_hour_i = (value_hour_i_on_2016_08_29 + value_hour_i_on_2016_08_23) / 2\n\n 24. But let's check if there is a trend? We can adjust by the overall change from last Tuesday to this Monday? \n\n      Overall, the average price of last Tuesday (2016/8/23) was: \n          (22.43+22.13+...+25.11)/24 = let's compute roughly: \n          We see the prices on 2016/8/23: \n            min: 21.20, max: 30.35, average around 27? \n          Actually, we can calculate:\n\n          2016/8/23: \n            0:00: 22.43, 1:00:22.13, 2:00:21.63, 23:00:25.11 -> average = (sum of 24 values)/24\n\n      Instead, we can compute the daily average for each day:\n\n        2016/8/23 (Tue): \n          sum = 22.43+22.13+21.63+21.20+21.95+24.06+26.55+28.96+29.93+30.12+30.14+29.97+30.35+30.06+29.90+29.66+29.64+29.96+30.06+30.00+29.36+29.05+27.11+25.11\n          = 22.43+22.13+21.63+21.20+21.95+24.06+26.55+28.96+29.93+30.12+30.14+29.97+30.35+30.06+29.90+29.66+29.64+29.96+30.06+30.00+29.36+29.05+27.11+25.11\n          = 659.77\n          average = 659.77 / 24 = 27.4904167\n\n        2016/8/29 (Mon): \n          sum = 21.87+22.28+21.55+21.79+21.37+23.11+26.92+29.90+33.35+31.20+30.11+29.57+29.46+29.20+28.56+27.95+26.93+27.59+27.96+28.16+28.14+27.82+25.59+23.44\n          = 21.87+22.28+21.55+21.79+21.37+23.11+26.92+29.90+33.35+31.20+30.11+29.57+29.46+29.20+28.56+27.95+26.93+27.59+27.96+28.16+28.14+27.82+25.59+23.44\n          = 644.11\n          average = 644.11 / 24 = 26.8379167\n\n      The average price on Monday is about 26.84, and on last Tuesday was 27.49. There is a drop of about 0.65.\n\n 25. We can adjust the last Tuesday's data by the relative change? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use the average of the two days (last Monday and last Tuesday) without adjustment? \n\n 27. We decide to use the average of the same hour from the last Monday (2016/8/29) and the same hour from the last Tuesday (2016/8/23). \n\n 28. However, we note that the day of the week for the forecast is Tuesday, and we have a full Monday and a full Tuesday from the past. \n\n 29. We'll compute for each hour i (0 to 23):\n\n        forecast_i = (OT_{2016-08-29, i} + OT_{2016-08-23, i}) / 2\n\n 30. Let's do an example for hour 0:00:\n        last Tuesday (2016/8/23 0:00): 22.43\n        last Monday (2016/8/29 0:00): 21.87\n        forecast = (22.43 + 21.87) / 2 = 22.15\n\n 31. But we also have the data for the same hour on the previous days. We might want to include the immediate past (the day before) more? \n\n 32. We can try a weighted average: 60% for the day before (Monday) and 40% for the same day last week? \n\n        forecast_i = 0.6 * OT_{2016-08-29, i} + 0.4 * OT_{2016-08-23, i}\n\n 33. For hour 0:00: 0.6*21.87 + 0.4*22.43 = 13.122 + 8.972 = 22.094\n\n 34. We choose the weighted average with weights 0.6 (for the day before) and 0.4 (for the same day last week) because the day before is more recent and might capture the current trend better.\n\n 35. We'll use this for all 24 hours.\n\n 36. Now, we generate the forecast for 2016/8/30 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 37. We note the data for 2016/8/23 (Tuesday) and 2016/8/29 (Monday) are:\n\n        Hour 0:00: 2016/8/23 -> 22.43, 2016/8/29 -> 21.87 -> forecast = 0.6*21.87 + 0.4*22.43 = 22.094\n        Hour 1:00: 2016/8/23 -> 22.13, 2016/8/29 -> 22.28 -> forecast = 0.6*22.28 + 0.4*22.13 = 22.22\n        Hour 2:00: 2016/8/23 -> 21.63, 2016/8/29 -> 21.55 -> forecast = 0.6*21.55 + 0.4*21.63 = 21.582\n        Hour 3:00: 2016/8/23 -> 21.20, 2016/8/29 -> 21.79 -> forecast = 0.6*21.79 + 0.4*21.20 = 21.554\n        Hour 4:00: 2016/8/23 -> 21.95, 2016/8/29 -> 21.37 -> forecast = 0.6*21.37 + 0.4*21.95 = 21.602\n        Hour 5:00: 2016/8/23 -> 24.06, 2016/8/29 -> 23.11 -> forecast = 0.6*23.11 + 0.4*24.06 = 23.55\n        Hour 6:00: 2016/8/23 -> 26.55, 2016/8/29 -> 26.92 -> forecast = 0.6*26.92 + 0.4*26.55 = 26.772\n        Hour 7:00: 2016/8/23 -> 28.96, 2016/8/29 -> 29.90 -> forecast = 0.6*29.90 + 0.4*28.96 = 29.524\n        Hour 8:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.93, 2016/8/29 -> 33.35 -> forecast = 0.6*33.35 + 0.4*29.93 = 32.042\n        Hour 9:00: 2016/8/23 -> 30.12, 2016/8/29 -> 31.20 -> forecast = 0.6*31.20 + 0.4*30.12 = 30.768\n        Hour 10:00: 2016/8/23 -> 30.14, 2016/8/29 -> 30.11 -> forecast = 0.6*30.11 + 0.4*30.14 = 30.122\n        Hour 11:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.97, 2016/8/29 -> 29.57 -> forecast = 0.6*29.57 + 0.4*29.97 = 29.73\n        Hour 12:00: 2016/8/23 -> 30.35, 2016/8/29 -> 29.46 -> forecast = 0.6*29.46 + 0.4*30.35 = 29.816\n        Hour 13:00: 2016/8/23 -> 30.06, 2016/8/29 -> 29.20 -> forecast = 0.6*29.20 + 0.4*30.06 = 29.544\n        Hour 14:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.90, 2016/8/29 -> 28.56 -> forecast = 0.6*28.56 + 0.4*29.90 = 29.016\n        Hour 15:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.66, 2016/8/29 -> 27.95 -> forecast = 0.6*27.95 + 0.4*29.66 = 28.634\n        Hour 16:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.64, 2016/8/29 -> 26.93 -> forecast = 0.6*26.93 + 0.4*29.64 = 28.014\n        Hour 17:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.96, 2016/8/29 -> 27.59 -> forecast = 0.6*27.59 + 0.4*29.96 = 28.418\n        Hour 18:00: 2016/8/23 -> 30.06, 2016/8/29 -> 27.96 -> forecast = 0.6*27.96 + 0.4*30.06 = 28.8\n        Hour 19:00: 2016/8/23 -> 30.00, 2016/8/29 -> 28.16 -> forecast = 0.6*28.16 + 0.4*30.00 = 28.896\n        Hour 20:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.36, 2016/8/29 -> 28.14 -> forecast = 0.6*28.14 + 0.4*29.36 = 28.548\n        Hour 21:00: 2016/8/23 -> 29.05, 2016/8/29 -> 27.82 -> forecast = 0.6*27.82 + 0.4*29.05 = 28.432\n        Hour 22:00: 2016/8/23 -> 27.11, 2016/8/29 -> 25.59 -> forecast = 0.6*25.59 + 0.4*27.11 = 26.318\n        Hour 23:00: 2016/8/23 -> 25.11, 2016/8/29 -> 23.44 -> forecast = 0.6*23.44 + 0.4*25.11 = 24.228\n\n 38.
