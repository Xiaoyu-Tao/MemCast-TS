        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015/7/14 0:00 to 2015/7/20 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2015/7/21 0:00 to 2015/7/21 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are dealing with hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, we only have one week of data, so weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: \n   - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day (i.e., 24 hours ago) as the forecast.\n   - Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past few days.\n\n However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's look at the days:\n\n   Weekday of 2015/7/14: Tuesday\n   2015/7/15: Wednesday\n   2015/7/16: Thursday\n   2015/7/17: Friday\n   2015/7/18: Saturday\n   2015/7/19: Sunday\n   2015/7/20: Monday\n\n We are forecasting for 2015/7/21: Tuesday.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2015/7/14) and also consider the pattern of the most recent days.\n\n But note: the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices. So we might use:\n\n   Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) as the forecast. However, we only have one week of data, so the previous Tuesday is the only one.\n\n   Option 2: Use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour.\n\n Considering the limited data, we can do:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (Tuesday, 2015/7/21), we take the average of the same hour h from the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). But note that Friday is a weekday and Monday is a weekday, but we are missing Wednesday? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and then adjust for the weekday effect? But without more data, it's tricky.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday (2015/7/14) and also the day before (Monday 2015/7/20) and the same day last week, we can use:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on 2015/7/21 = (value at hour h on 2015/7/14 + value at hour h on 2015/7/20) / 2\n\n Why?\n   - 2015/7/14 is the same day of the week (Tuesday) one week ago.\n   - 2015/7/20 is the previous day (Monday) which might be similar to Tuesday? But note that Monday and Tuesday are both weekdays.\n\n However, looking at the data, the pattern of 2015/7/20 (Monday) and 2015/7/14 (Tuesday) are somewhat similar? Let's compare:\n\n   Hour 0: 2015/7/14: 8.79, 2015/7/20: 9.19 -> average = (8.79+9.19)/2 = 8.99\n   Hour 1: 8.20 and 8.48 -> 8.34\n   But let's see the entire day: \n        2015/7/14: \n          0:00  8.79\n          1:00  8.20\n          2:00  7.70\n          3:00  7.39\n          4:00  7.75\n          5:00  8.79\n          6:00 12.28\n          7:00 13.81\n          8:00 14.83\n          9:00 15.25\n          10:00 15.56\n          11:00 15.42\n          12:00 15.33\n          13:00 14.93\n          14:00 14.55\n          15:00 13.66\n          16:00 13.53\n          17:00 13.33\n          18:00 13.06\n          19:00 12.89\n          20:00 12.06\n          21:00 11.57\n          22:00 11.01\n          23:00  9.18\n\n        2015/7/20:\n          0:00  9.19\n          1:00  8.48\n          2:00  8.05\n          3:00  7.55\n          4:00  7.27\n          5:00  8.42\n          6:00  9.59\n          7:00 10.66\n          8:00 11.94\n          9:00 11.93\n          10:00 12.00\n          11:00 11.93\n          12:00 11.61\n          13:00 11.30\n          14:00 10.98\n          15:00 10.78\n          16:00 10.85\n          17:00 11.55\n          18:00 11.98\n          19:00 12.03\n          20:00 12.00\n          21:00 11.75\n          22:00 11.53\n          23:00 10.66\n\n   We see that the pattern is similar: low at night, peak in the morning and then decrease? But the magnitude is different: the previous Tuesday had higher peaks (around 15.5) while Monday had peaks around 12.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Sunday, Monday, and Saturday) but Saturday and Sunday are weekends and have lower prices? \n\n   The day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, so we want to use weekdays. We have:\n\n        Last Tuesday (7 days ago): 2015/7/14\n        Last Monday (1 day ago): 2015/7/20\n        Last Friday (4 days ago): 2015/7/17? But that's 4 days ago.\n\n   Since we don't have a lot of weekdays, we can use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h = (value at hour h on 2015/7/14 + value at hour h on 2015/7/20 + value at hour h on 2015/7/16 (Thursday) + value at hour h on 2015/7/15 (Wednesday)) / 4\n\n   But note: we have 4 weekdays: \n        Tuesday (2015/7/14), Wednesday (2015/7/15), Thursday (2015/7/16), Friday (2015/7/17), and then Monday (2015/7/20). \n\n   We are missing Saturday and Sunday? We don't want to include them because they are weekends.\n\n   However, the forecast day is a Tuesday, so we can use the average of the same hour on the previous weekdays? But note that the pattern might change from week to week.\n\n   Considering simplicity and the fact that we have limited data, I will use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). But Friday is 4 days ago and Monday is 1 day ago, so we can do:\n\n        Forecast = (Monday + Tuesday_prev) / 2   [because Monday is the most recent weekday and Tuesday_prev is the same day last week]\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last week and the same hour for the previous day (Monday) and then adjust by a trend? But without more data, we cannot compute a trend.\n\n   Let's try with the average of the same hour from the last week (2015/7/14) and the same hour from the previous day (2015/7/20).\n\n   We'll compute for each hour from 0 to 23:\n\n        forecast_hour_h = (OT_h from 2015/7/14 + OT_h from 2015/7/20) / 2\n\n   But note: the data for 2015/7/20 is the day before the forecast day, and 2015/7/14 is 7 days before.\n\n   We'll generate the forecast for 2015/7/21 0:00 to 2015/7/21 23:00.\n\n   For hour 0: (8.79 + 9.19) / 2 = 8.99\n   For hour 1: (8.20 + 8.48) / 2 = 8.34\n   ... and so on.\n\n   However, let's check the data for 2015/7/20: it was a Monday and 2015/7/14 was a Tuesday. The forecast day is a Tuesday. So we are using two Tuesdays? Actually, 2015/7/20 is a Monday. \n\n   We might also consider that the price on Monday and Tuesday might be similar? But the previous Tuesday had higher peaks. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   Given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a model, I will use the average of the same hour from the same day of the previous week and the previous day (which is Monday). \n\n   This is a common approach in time series forecasting when having weekly and daily patterns.\n\n   We'll generate the 24 forecasts accordingly.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n        Hour 0: (8.79 + 9.19) /2 = 8.99\n        Hour 1: (8.20 + 8.48) /2 = 8.34\n        Hour 2: (7.70 + 8.05) /2 = 7.875\n        Hour 3: (7.39 + 7.55) /2 = 7.47\n        Hour 4: (7.75 + 7.27) /2 = 7.51\n        Hour 5: (8.79 + 8.42) /2 = 8.605\n        Hour 6: (12.28 + 9.59) /2 = 10.935\n        Hour 7: (13.81 + 10.66) /2 = 12.235\n        Hour 8: (14.83 + 11.94) /2 = 13.385\n        Hour 9: (15.25 + 11.93) /2 = 13.59\n        Hour 10: (15.56 + 12.00) /2 = 13.78\n        Hour 11: (15.42 + 11.93) /2 = 13.675\n        Hour 12: (15.33 + 11.61) /2 = 13.47\n        Hour 13: (14.93 + 11.30) /2 = 13.115\n        Hour 14: (14.55 + 10.98) /2 = 12.765\n        Hour 15: (13.66 + 10.78) /2 = 12.22\n        Hour 16: (13.53 + 10.85) /2 = 12.19\n        Hour 17: (13.33 + 11.55) /2 = 12.44\n        Hour 18: (13.06 + 11.98) /2 = 12.52\n        Hour 19: (12.89 + 12.03) /2 = 12.46\n        Hour 20: (12.06 + 12.00) /2 = 12.03\n        Hour 21: (11.57 + 11.75) /2 = 11.66\n        Hour 22: (11.01 + 11.53) /2 = 11.27\n        Hour 23: (9.18 + 10.66) /2 = 9.92\n\n   But note: the previous Tuesday (2015/7/14) had higher prices than Monday (2015/7/20). So the forecast for Tuesday might be in between.\n\n   However, we must consider that the prices in the last few days (like the 2015/7/20) are lower than the same day last week. So the market might be experiencing a downward trend? But we don't have enough data to confirm.\n\n   Since we are only allowed to use the given data and we don't have exogenous variables, we'll stick with this simple average.\n\n   Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2015/7/21 0:00 to 2015/7/21 23:00) is:\n\n        2015/7/21 0:00: 8.99\n        2015/7/21 1:00: 8.34\n        2015/7/21 2:00: 7.875\n        2015/7/21 3:00: 7.47\n        2015/7/21 4:00: 7.51\n        2015/7/21 5:00: 8.605\n        2015/7/21 6:00: 10.935\n        2015/7/21 7:00: 12.235\n        2015/7/21 8:00: 13.385\n        2015/7/21 9:00: 13.59\n        2015/7/21 10:00: 13.78\n        2015/7/21 11:00: 13.675\n        2015/7/21 12:00: 13.47\n        2015/7/21 13:00: 13.115\n        2015/7/21 14:00: 12.765\n        2015/7/21 15:00: 12.22\n        2015/7/21 16:00: 12.19\n        2015/7/21 17:00: 12.44\n        2015/7/21 18:00: 12.52\n        2015/7/21 19:00: 12.46\n        2015/7/21 20:00: 12.03\n        2015/7/21 21:00: 11.66\n        2015/7/21 22:00: 11.27\n        2015/7/21 23:00: 9.92\n\n   We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n   However, note that the input data has two decimal places. We'll round our forecast to two decimal places.\n\n   Let's round:\n\n        0:00: 8.99 -> 8.99\n        1:00: 8.34 -> 8.34\n        2:00: 7.875 -> 7.88\n        3:00: 7.47 -> 7.47\n        4:00: 7.51 -> 7.51\n        5:00: 8.605 -> 8.61\n        6:00: 10.935 -> 10.94\n        7:00: 12.235 -> 12.24\n        8:00: 13.385 -> 13.39\n        9:00: 13.59 -> 13.59\n        10:00: 13.78 -> 13.78\n        11:00: 13.675 -> 13.68\n        12:00: 13.47 -> 13.47\n        13:00: 13.115 -> 13.12\n        14:00: 12.765 -> 12.77\n        15:00: 12.22 -> 12.22\n        16:00: 12.19 -> 12.19\n        17:00: 12.44 -> 12.44\n        18:00: 12.52 -> 12.52\n        19:00: 12.46 -> 12.46\n        20:00: 12.03 -> 12.03\n        21:00: 11.66 -> 11.66\n        22:00: 11.27 -> 11.27\n        23:00: 9.92 -> 9.92\n\n   This is our forecast.\n\n   However, note: the method is very simple. In practice, we might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, etc.) but given the constraints (only 168 points and no exogenous variables) and the requirement for a quick forecast, this is acceptable.\n\n   We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n   Note: The date of the forecast is 2015/7/21 0:00 to 2015/7/21 23:00.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2015/7/21 0:00 [forecast_value]\n        2015/7/21 1:00 [forecast_value]\n        ...\n        2015/7/21 23:00 [forecast_value]\n        </answer>\n\n   We write the 24 lines with the date and the forecasted value (rounded to two decimal places).\n",
