        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/5/13 0:00 to 2014/5/19 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/5/20 0:00 to 2014/5/20 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (without the other features like grid load or wind power), we must rely on a time series forecasting method that can handle the hourly seasonality and potential weekly patterns.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: In the provided data, there are no missing values. All 168 hours are present.\n 2. We note that electricity prices typically exhibit:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Weekly seasonality (168 hours)\n 3. Given the data is at hourly resolution and we have exactly one week of data (168 hours), we can use a model that captures these patterns.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only allowed to use the provided historical prices and we are to forecast the next 24 hours, we can use a simple but effective method: \n    - Use the average of the same hour in the previous days (over the last week) to forecast the next day.\n\n However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's look at the days:\n\n We have data from Monday (2014/5/19) back to Tuesday (2014/5/13). But note:\n  2014/5/13: Tuesday\n  2014/5/14: Wednesday\n  2014/5/15: Thursday\n  2014/5/16: Friday\n  2014/5/17: Saturday\n  2014/5/18: Sunday\n  2014/5/19: Monday\n\n We are to forecast 2014/5/20: Tuesday.\n\n Therefore, we can use the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2014/5/13) in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But note that weekdays and weekends have different patterns.\n\n Since we have only one week of data, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday May 13) as the forecast for Tuesday May 20? But that would ignore the recent trend.\n\n Option 2: Use a moving average of the last few days, but adjusted for the day of the week.\n\n However, note that the problem does not to have other features, so we must rely on the target variable.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 168 points, we can try:\n\n  - Using the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (i.e., the entire week) to forecast the next day.\n\n But let's check the pattern:\n\n  For example, the hour 0:00 (midnight) in the last 7 days:\n\n    2014/5/13 0:00: 27.24\n    2014/5/14 0:00: 25.70\n    2014/5/15 0:00: 25.07\n    2014/5/16 0:00: 22.84\n    2014/5/17 0:00: 22.10\n    2014/5/18 0:00: 19.84\n    2014/5/19 0:00: 19.82\n\n  There is a downward trend. So a simple average might not capture the recent drop.\n\n Option 3: Use a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights.\n\n Option 4: Use an exponential smoothing method that accounts for seasonality. But without a library, we have to do it manually.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n  We use a method that takes the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which includes Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for forecasting Tuesday? But that might not be representative.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n  Since the day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday (2014/5/13) and also the recent trend, we can compute:\n\n    Forecast for hour h on Tuesday = (Price of hour h on last Tuesday * 0.5) + (Price of hour h on the previous day (Monday) * 0.3) + (Price of hour h on the day before (Sunday) * 0.2)\n\n  Why? Because the same day of the previous week is important, but the most recent days are also important.\n\n  However, note that the pattern on Monday (2014/5/19) might be more similar to the upcoming Tuesday than the previous Tuesday? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But the upcoming Tuesday is a weekday, and the last three weekdays are Monday (5/19), Friday (5/16) and Thursday (5/15)? \n\n  Actually, the last three weekdays: \n      Monday (5/19), Friday (5/16), Thursday (5/15), Wednesday (5/14), Tuesday (5/13)\n\n  But we have only one week of data.\n\n  Considering the trade-off, I will use a weighted average of the same hour over the last 7 days (with weights decreasing as we go back). The weights can be linear: [0.4, 0.3, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05] for the last 5 days? But we have 7 days.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing: \n      F_t = alpha * (average of the same hour in the last 7 days) + (1-alpha) * (the last observed value at that hour in the same week)\n\n  But that might be too simplistic.\n\n  After reviewing the data, I notice that the prices on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) are lower than weekdays. Therefore, for forecasting a weekday (Tuesday), we should rely more on the weekdays.\n\n  Proposed method:\n\n  For each hour h (0 to 23) of the day to be forecasted (2014/5/20, Tuesday):\n\n      Let D0 = the same hour h on the previous day (Monday, 2014/5/19)\n      Let D1 = the same hour h on the same day last week (Tuesday, 2014/5/13)\n      Let D2 = the same hour h on the day before the previous day (Sunday, 2014/5/18)  [but Sunday is a weekend, so less weight]\n      Let D3 = the same hour h on the day two days before (Saturday, 2014/5/17) [weekend]\n\n  We can use: \n      Forecast = (D0 * 0.5 + D1 * 0.3 + D2 * 0.1 + D3 * 0.1)\n\n  But note: the Monday (D0) is the most recent and same day type (weekday) and the Tuesday last week (D1) is the same weekday. The weekend days (D2 and D3) are given lower weights.\n\n  However, we have more weekdays? We also have Friday (2014/5/16) and Thursday (2014/5/15) and Wednesday (2014/5/14). But they are further away.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday) but with weights that decay with time.\n\n  Weights for the last 5 weekdays (from most recent to oldest: Monday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday) for the same hour:\n\n      Monday (5/19): weight = 0.4\n      Friday (5/16): weight = 0.3\n      Thursday (5/15): weight = 0.2\n      Wednesday (5/14): weight = 0.1\n      Tuesday (5/13): weight = 0.0   [because it's a week ago and we have more recent weekdays]\n\n  But wait, Tuesday (5/13) is the same day of the week, so we might want to include it. We can adjust:\n\n      Monday (5/19): 0.35\n      Friday (5/16): 0.25\n      Thursday (5/15): 0.2\n      Wednesday (5/14): 0.1\n      Tuesday (5/13): 0.1\n\n  However, note that the pattern on Tuesday might be different from Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? \n\n  Given the complexity and without a clear model, I choose a simpler approach:\n\n      Use the same hour from the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) and the weekend days (Sunday and Saturday) with minimal weights.\n\n  But to keep it simple and because we have only one week, I will use:\n\n      Forecast for hour h = (D0 * 0.5 + D1 * 0.3 + (the average of the same hour over the last 7 days) * 0.2)\n\n  However, the average of the last 7 days might smooth out the pattern.\n\n  After careful thought, I will use:\n\n      Forecast for hour h = (Price at hour h on Monday (5/19) * 0.6 + Price at hour h on Tuesday (5/13) * 0.4)\n\n  Why? Because Monday is the most recent weekday and Tuesday last week is the same day. We give more weight to the most recent day.\n\n  But let's test on a known point? We don't have the true value for 5/20, but we can check the pattern.\n\n  However, the problem does not require a complex model. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last 3 days (which includes Sunday and Saturday) for the same hour? But Sunday and Saturday are weekends and have lower prices, and Tuesday is a weekday.\n\n  Considering the above, I decide to use:\n\n      For each hour h in 0..23:\n\n          forecast_h = (price at the same hour on Monday (5/19) * 0.7 + price at the same hour on Tuesday (5/13) * 0.3)\n\n  This gives 70% weight to the most recent day (which is a weekday) and 30% to the same day last week.\n\n  Let's compute for h=0 (midnight):\n\n      Monday (5/19) 0:00: 19.82\n      Tuesday (5/13) 0:00: 27.24\n\n      forecast_0 = 19.82 * 0.7 + 27.24 * 0.3 = 13.874 + 8.172 = 22.046\n\n  For h=1:\n\n      Monday (5/19) 1:00: 19.45\n      Tuesday (5/13) 1:00: 26.52\n\n      forecast_1 = 19.45*0.7 + 26.52*0.3 = 13.615 + 7.956 = 21.571\n\n  But note: the prices on 5/19 are generally lower than 5/13. So this forecast will be a weighted average.\n\n  However, we must consider if there is a trend. The prices have been falling. So this method might be reasonable.\n\n  But we can also adjust for the overall trend? We don't have more data.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and then adjust by the difference between Monday and the previous Tuesday? \n\n  Given the time, I will stick to the simple weighted average of Monday and the same day last week.\n\n  Therefore, the forecast for 2014/5/20 (Tuesday) from 0:00 to 23:00 is computed as:\n\n      For hour h (0 to 23):\n          forecast = 0.7 * (hour h of 2014/5/19) + 0.3 * (hour h of 2014/5/13)\n\n  Let's compute:\n\n  We have the data for 2014/5/19 (Monday) and 2014/5/13 (Tuesday).\n\n  We'll list the hours for 2014/5/19 (Monday, 5/19):\n  0:00: 19.82\n  1:00: 19.45\n  2:00: 19.42\n  3:00: 19.47\n  4:00: 19.57\n  5:00: 21.19\n  6:00: 30.22\n  7:00: 31.32\n  8:00: 31.96\n  9:00: 31.19\n  10:00: 30.84\n  11:00: 30.73\n  12:00: 30.80\n  13:00: 30.60\n  14:00: 30.36\n  15:00: 29.93\n  16:00: 29.91\n  17:00: 30.27\n  18:00: 31.23\n  19:00: 30.56\n  20:00: 29.76\n  21:00: 29.79\n  22:00: 28.91\n  23:00: 26.15\n\n  And for 2014/5/13 (Tuesday):\n  0:00: 27.24\n  1:00: 26.52\n  2:00: 26.21\n  3:00: 25.95\n  4:00: 26.47\n  5:00: 28.45\n  6:00: 32.86\n  7:00: 36.48\n  8:00: 40.26\n  9:00: 39.22\n  10:00: 37.50\n  11:00: 36.59\n  12:00: 36.00\n  13:00: 34.11\n  14:00: 33.06\n  15:00: 31.63\n  16:00: 31.04\n  17:00: 31.43\n  18:00: 31.85\n  19:00: 31.94\n  20:00: 31.45\n  21:00: 31.95\n  22:00: 32.32\n  23:00: 29.58\n\n  Now, for each hour, we compute the forecast.\n\n  Example for 0:00: 0.7*19.82 + 0.3*27.24 = 13.874 + 8.172 = 22.046 -> round to 2 decimals: 22.05\n\n  We do the same for every hour.\n\n  However, note: the problem does not specify rounding, but the input data has two decimals. We'll output two decimals.\n\n  Let's compute the entire day:\n\n  Hour 0: 0.7*19.82 + 0.3*27.24 = 13.874 + 8.172 = 22.046 -> 22.05\n  Hour 1: 0.7*19.45 + 0.3*26.52 = 13.615 + 7.956 = 21.571 -> 21.57\n  Hour 2: 0.7*19.42 + 0.3*26.21 = 13.594 + 7.863 = 21.457 -> 21.46\n  Hour 3: 0.7*19.47 + 0.3*25.95 = 13.629 + 7.785 = 21.414 -> 21.41\n  Hour 4: 0.7*19.57 + 0.3*26.47 = 13.699 + 7.941 = 21.640 -> 21.64\n  Hour 5: 0.7*21.19 + 0.3*28.45 = 14.833 + 8.535 = 23.368 -> 23.37\n  Hour 6: 0.7*30.22 + 0.3*32.86 = 21.154 + 9.858 = 31.012 -> 31.01\n  Hour 7: 0.7*31.32 + 0.3*36.48 = 21.924 + 10.944 = 32.868 -> 32.87\n  Hour 8: 0.7*31.96 + 0.3*40.26 = 22.372 + 12.078 = 34.450 -> 34.45\n  Hour 9: 0.7*31.19 + 0.3*39.22 = 21.833 + 11.766 = 33.599 -> 33.60\n  Hour 10: 0.7*30.84 + 0.3*37.50 = 21.588 + 11.250 = 32.838 -> 32.84\n  Hour 11: 0.7*30.73 + 0.3*36.59 = 21.511 + 10.977 = 32.488 -> 32.49\n  Hour 12: 0.7*30.80 + 0.3*36.00 = 21.560 + 10.800 = 32.360 -> 32.36\n  Hour 13: 0.7*30.60 + 0.3*34.11 = 21.420 + 10.233 = 31.653 -> 31.65\n  Hour 14: 0.7*30.36 + 0.3*33.06 = 21.252 + 9.918 = 31.170 -> 31.17\n  Hour 15: 0.7*29.93 + 0.3*31.63 = 20.951 + 9.489 = 30.440 -> 30.44\n  Hour 16: 0.7*29.91 + 0.3*31.04 = 20.937 + 9.312 = 30.249 -> 30.25\n  Hour 17: 0.7*30.27 + 0.3*31.43 = 21.189 + 9.429 = 30.618 -> 30.62\n  Hour 18: 0.7*31.23 + 0.3*31.85 = 21.861 + 9.555 = 31.416 -> 31.42\n  Hour 19: 0.7*30.56 + 0.3*31.94 = 21.392 + 9.582 = 30.974 -> 30.97\n  Hour 20: 0.7*29.76 + 0.3*31.45 = 20.832 + 9.435 = 30.267 -> 30.27\n  Hour 21: 0.7*29.79 + 0.3*31.95 = 20.853 + 9.585 = 30.438 -> 30.44\n  Hour 22: 0.7*28.91 + 0.3*32.32 = 20.237 + 9.696 = 29.933 -> 29.93\n  Hour 23: 0.7*26.15 + 0.3*29.58 = 18.305 + 8.874 = 27.179 -> 27.18\n\n  Therefore, the forecast for 2014/5/20:\n\n  0:00: 22.05\n  1:00: 21.57\n  2:00: 21.46\n  3:00: 21.41\n  4:00: 21.64\n  5:00: 23.37\n  6:00: 31.01\n  7:00: 32.87\n  8:00: 34.45\n  9:00: 33.60\n  10:00: 32.84\n  11:00: 32.49\n  12:00: 32.36\n  13:00: 31.65\n  14:00: 31.17\n  15:00: 30.44\n  16:00: 30.25\n  17:00: 30.62\n  18:00: 31.42\n  19:00: 30.97\n  20:00: 30.27\n  21:00: 30.44\n  22:00: 29.93\n  23:00: 27.18\n\n  We output the forecast in the same style as the input, but for the next day: 2014/5/20.\n\n  Note: The date format in the input uses a space between date and time, and the date is in the format \"YYYY/M/D H:MM\", but note the hour is given as \"0:00\", \"1:00\", etc.\n\n  We'll output:\n\n      2014/5/20 0:00 [forecast]\n      2014/5/20 1:00 [forecast]\n      ...\n\n  However, note the input has the date format: \n        \"2014/5/13 0:00\"\n\n  So we use the same.\n\n  But wait: the input has the hour part without a leading zero for the hour? It uses \"0:00\", not \"00:00\". We follow.\n\n  Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours:\n\n      2014/5/20 0:00 22.05\n      2014/5/20 1:00 21.57\n      2014/5/20 2:00 21.46\n      2014/5/20 3:00 21.41\n      2014/5/20 4:00 21.64\n      2014/5/20 5:00 23.37\n      2014/5/20 6:00 31.01\n      2014/5/20 7:00 32.87\n      2014/5/20 8:00 34.45\n      2014/5/20 9:00 33.60\n      2014/5/20 10:00 32.84\n      2014/5/20 11:00 32.49\n      2014/5/20 12:00 32.36\n      2014/5/20 13:00 31.65\n      2014/5/20 14:00 31.17\n      2014/5/20 15:00 30.44\n      2014/5/20 16:00 30.25\n      2014/5/20 17:00 30.62\n      2014/5/20 18:00 31.42\n      2014/5/20 19:00 30.97\n      2014/5/20 20:00 30.27\n      2014/5/20 21:00 30.44\n      2014/5/20 22:00 29.93\n      2014/5/20 23:00 27.18\n\n  We output in the required format.\n\n  Note: This is a simple heuristic.
