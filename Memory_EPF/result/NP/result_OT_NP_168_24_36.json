        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2013-09-10 00:00 to 2013-09-16 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2013-09-17 00:00 to 2013-09-17 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the target variable (OT).\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: \n   - Seasonal Naive: The forecast for each hour in the next day is the same as the observed value at the same hour in the previous day (or same day of the week). However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's check the days: \n        The last day in the data is Monday (2013-09-16). We are to forecast Tuesday (2013-09-17).\n\n But note: the data from 2013-09-10 (Tuesday) to 2013-09-16 (Monday) is 7 days. However, we are forecasting the next day (Tuesday) which would be similar to the previous Tuesday (2013-09-10) or the same as the previous day (Monday) might not be the best.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices during the day and lower at night, while weekends (Saturday and Sunday) have lower and more stable prices.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2013-09-10) as a reference? But note that the market conditions might have changed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, without additional data (like the grid load and wind power) we are limited.\n\n Given the requirement for a short-term forecast and the strong daily seasonality, we can use a seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours (daily). But note that the day of the week effect: Tuesdays might be similar to previous Tuesdays? However, we only have one Tuesday in the data (2013-09-10). Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day (i.e., 168 hours ago) but that would be the same as 2013-09-10.\n\n But let's compare the last two days (Sunday and Monday) with the same days a week ago? We don't have data before 2013-09-10.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last few days at the same hour? \n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we are only given the target variable, I propose:\n\n Method 1: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (i.e., the entire available history) to forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n However, note that the data includes both weekdays and weekends. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we might want to use only the previous Tuesday? But we only have one Tuesday. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But the last 3 weekdays are Friday (2013-09-13), Monday (2013-09-16) and then we have Thursday (2013-09-12), Wednesday (2013-09-11) and Tuesday (2013-09-10). \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday (2013-09-10) and we are forecasting the next Tuesday (2013-09-17). \n\n However, the data shows that the pattern on weekdays is similar? Let's try to see:\n\n We can also consider that the most recent day (Monday, 2013-09-16) might be the most relevant. But the forecast is for Tuesday, which might be more similar to the previous Tuesday (2013-09-10) than to Monday.\n\n Given the limited data and the requirement for a simple method, I will use:\n\n   - The average of the same hour over the last 7 days (i.e., the entire week) for each hour.\n\n But note: the data we have is exactly 7 days (168 hours). So for each hour in the day (0 to 23) we have 7 observations (from 2013-09-10 to 2013-09-16). We can compute the average for each hour.\n\n However, this might smooth out the weekday/weekend difference. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday (which is a weekday) and the average would include two weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) which are lower, it might under-forecast.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median? Or we can use only the weekdays? We have 5 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday, Sunday). \n\n Since the weekend days are different, we can take the average of the same hour for the weekdays only?\n\n How many weekdays do we have for each hour? \n   - Tuesday (2013-09-10): 1\n   - Wednesday (2013-09-11): 1\n   - Thursday (2013-09-12): 1\n   - Friday (2013-09-13): 1\n   - Monday (2013-09-16): 1\n   - Saturday (2013-09-14): 1\n   - Sunday (2013-09-15): 1\n\n So we have 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.\n\n For forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the average of the 5 weekdays? But note that Monday is a weekday and might be similar to Tuesday? However, we have only one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Let me try to compute the average for each hour over the 5 weekdays and then use that as the forecast for the next Tuesday.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   - For hour 0: average of the hour 0 from 2013-09-10 (Tue), 2013-09-11 (Wed), 2013-09-12 (Thu), 2013-09-13 (Fri), 2013-09-16 (Mon)\n   - Similarly for hour 1, ... hour 23.\n\n But note: the last day is Monday (2013-09-16) and we are forecasting Tuesday (2013-09-17). We have no Tuesday in the last 7 days except the one a week ago.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday, so that would be the same as the previous Tuesday.\n\n However, the previous Tuesday (2013-09-10) might be too old? \n\n Considering the trade-off, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 5 weekdays (excluding the weekend) to capture the weekday pattern.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the weekdays: \n   Weekdays: \n     2013-09-10 (Tuesday)\n     2013-09-11 (Wednesday)\n     2013-09-12 (Thursday)\n     2013-09-13 (Friday)\n     2013-09-16 (Monday)\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and take the average.\n\n Example for hour 0:\n   Tue: 36.38\n   Wed: 36.77 -> but wait, the data for 2013-09-11 0:00 is 36.77? Actually, the first hour of each day is 0:00.\n\n Let me extract:\n\n Hour 0: \n   09-10: 36.38\n   09-11: 36.77\n   09-12: 37.36\n   09-13: 37.68\n   09-16: 33.25   (Monday)\n\n Average = (36.38 + 36.77 + 37.36 + 37.68 + 33.25) / 5 = 181.44 / 5 = 36.288\n\n But note: the Monday value (33.25) is much lower. Is that because of a different pattern? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of outliers? \n\n However, without more context, we'll use the average.\n\n Let's do it for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data for Monday (2013-09-16) at hour 0 is 33.25, which is lower than the rest. This might be an outlier? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the median? \n\n Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday data point, we can also consider a weighted average that gives more weight to the same day of the week? \n\n However, to keep it simple, I will use the average of the 5 weekdays for each hour.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the 5 weekdays.\n\n   For hour h in [0,23]:\n        values = [price at hour h on 2013-09-10, 2013-09-11, 2013-09-12, 2013-09-13, 2013-09-16]\n        forecast_h = average(values)\n\n Then the forecast for 2013-09-17 00:00 is the average of the 5 values for hour 0, and so on.\n\n Let me compute:\n\n Hour 0: [36.38, 36.77, 37.36, 37.68, 33.25] -> average = (36.38+36.77+37.36+37.68+33.25)/5 = 181.44/5 = 36.288\n Hour 1: [35.43, 36.24, 36.71, 37.07, 31.77] -> (35.43+36.24+36.71+37.07+31.77)/5 = 177.22/5 = 35.444\n Hour 2: [35.30, 35.98, 36.39, 36.66, 31.03] -> (35.30+35.98+36.39+36.66+31.03)/5 = 175.36/5 = 35.072\n Hour 3: [35.26, 35.80, 36.34, 36.62, 31.64] -> (35.26+35.80+36.34+36.62+31.64)/5 = 175.66/5 = 35.132\n Hour 4: [35.44, 36.17, 36.75, 37.10, 32.39] -> (35.44+36.17+36.75+37.10+32.39)/5 = 177.85/5 = 35.57\n Hour 5: [37.17, 37.65, 38.06, 38.21, 34.94] -> (37.17+37.65+38.06+38.21+34.94)/5 = 186.03/5 = 37.206\n Hour 6: [40.23, 40.29, 42.06, 41.14, 37.09] -> (40.23+40.29+42.06+41.14+37.09)/5 = 200.81/5 = 40.162\n Hour 7: [44.58, 43.92, 45.13, 45.48, 40.05] -> (44.58+43.92+45.13+45.48+40.05)/5 = 219.16/5 = 43.832\n Hour 8: [46.85, 46.42, 46.38, 46.97, 40.55] -> (46.85+46.42+46.38+46.97+40.55)/5 = 227.17/5 = 45.434\n Hour 9: [47.85, 45.69, 46.13, 48.63, 40.94] -> (47.85+45.69+46.13+48.63+40.94)/5 = 229.24/5 = 45.848\n Hour 10: [46.79, 45.09, 46.75, 48.16, 40.66] -> (46.79+45.09+46.75+48.16+40.66)/5 = 227.45/5 = 45.49\n Hour 11: [46.23, 46.70, 45.84, 48.11, 40.66] -> (46.23+46.70+45.84+48.11+40.66)/5 = 227.54/5 = 45.508\n Hour 12: [46.43, 46.87, 45.74, 46.99, 40.45] -> (46.43+46.87+45.74+46.99+40.45)/5 = 226.48/5 = 45.296\n Hour 13: [44.81, 44.71, 44.57, 45.70, 39.95] -> (44.81+44.71+44.57+45.70+39.95)/5 = 219.74/5 = 43.948\n Hour 14: [43.33, 44.05, 42.58, 43.38, 39.88] -> (43.33+44.05+42.58+43.38+39.88)/5 = 213.22/5 = 42.644\n Hour 15: [43.06, 43.06, 42.75, 42.00, 39.58] -> (43.06+43.06+42.75+42.00+39.58)/5 = 210.45/5 = 42.09\n Hour 16: [42.69, 43.32, 42.95, 42.08, 39.57] -> (42.69+43.32+42.95+42.08+39.57)/5 = 210.61/5 = 42.122\n Hour 17: [43.02, 43.06, 42.96, 43.35, 39.84] -> (43.02+43.06+42.96+43.35+39.84)/5 = 212.23/5 = 42.446\n Hour 18: [43.76, 44.26, 43.37, 43.73, 39.76] -> (43.76+44.26+43.37+43.73+39.76)/5 = 214.88/5 = 42.976\n Hour 19: [44.46, 45.01, 43.77, 44.69, 39.72] -> (44.46+45.01+43.77+44.69+39.72)/5 = 217.65/5 = 43.53\n Hour 20: [43.58, 45.30, 46.47, 44.84, 39.14] -> (43.58+45.30+46.47+44.84+39.14)/5 = 219.33/5 = 43.866\n Hour 21: [40.79, 44.13, 41.23, 39.93, 38.65] -> (40.79+44.13+41.23+39.93+38.65)/5 = 204.73/5 = 40.946\n Hour 22: [39.72, 40.96, 40.73, 38.90, 37.35] -> (39.72+40.96+40.73+38.90+37.35)/5 = 197.66/5 = 39.532\n Hour 23: [37.01, 37.93, 37.98, 37.57, 36.25] -> (37.01+37.93+37.98+37.57+36.25)/5 = 186.74/5 = 37.348\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2013-09-17 (Tuesday) from 00:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n   00:00: 36.288\n   01:00: 35.444\n   02:00: 35.072\n   03:00: 35.132\n   04:00: 35.57\n   05:00: 37.206\n   06:00: 40.162\n   07:00: 43.832\n   08:00: 45.434\n   09:00: 45.848\n   10:00: 45.49\n   11:00: 45.508\n   12:00: 45.296\n   13:00: 43.948\n   14:00: 42.644\n   15:00: 42.09\n   16:00: 42.122\n   17:00: 42.446\n   18:00: 42.976\n   19:00: 43.53\n   20:00: 43.866\n   21:00: 40.946\n   22:00: 39.532\n   23:00: 37.348\n\n However, note that the Monday (2013-09-16) had a significant drop at the beginning of the day. This might be due to a change in the pattern? But without more information, we stick to the average.\n\n But let me check: the previous Tuesday (2013-09-10) had a pattern that started at 36.38 and went up to 47.85 at 9:00. Our forecast for 9:00 is 45.848, which is a bit lower because of the inclusion of Monday (which had 40.94 at 9:00). \n\n Alternatively, we could use the median to avoid the effect of the low Monday? \n\n Let me compute the median for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: [33.25, 36.38, 36.77, 37.36, 37.68] -> sorted: [33.25, 36.38, 36.77, 37.36, 37.68] -> median = 36.77\n Hour 1: [31.77, 35.43, 36.24, 36.71, 37.07] -> sorted: [31.77, 35.43, 36.24, 36.71, 37.07] -> median = 36.24\n ... \n\n This would take time. And the median might be more robust? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the method. Since the average is common and we have only 5 points, I will stick to the average.\n\n But note: the problem says \"handle missing values carefully\", but there are none. \n\n Therefore, we output the 24 forecasted values as above.\n\n Format: \n   We output the next 24 hours starting from 2013-09-17 00:00 to 2013-09-17 23:00.\n\n Let me write the dates:\n\n   2013/9/17 0:00: 36.288\n   2013/9/17 1:00: 35.444\n   ... \n\n We'll round to 2 decimal places? The input data has 2 decimal places. So we round to 2 decimal places.\n\n However, note: the average might have more decimals. We'll round to 2 decimal places.\n\n Let me recalculate and round:\n\n  00:00: 36.288 -> 36.29\n  01:00: 35.444 -> 35.44\n  02:00: 35.072 -> 35.07\n  03:00: 35.132 -> 35.13\n  04:00: 35.57 -> 35.57\n  35.57 is already at 2 decimals? Actually, 35.57 is 35.570 -> 35.57\n  05:00: 37.206 -> 37.21\n  06:00: 40.162 -> 40.16\n  07:00: 43.832 -> 43.83\n  08:00: 45.434 -> 45.43\n  09:00: 45.848 -> 45.85\n  10:00: 45.49 -> 45.49 (since 45.49 is 45.490, so 45.49)\n  11:00: 45.508 -> 45.51\n  12:00: 45.296 -> 45.30\n  13:00: 43.948 -> 43.95\n  14:00: 42.644 -> 42.64\n  15:00: 42.09 -> 42.09 (it's already 42.09, but note: 42.09 is 42.090 -> 42.09)\n  16:00: 42.122 -> 42.12\n  17:00: 42.446 -> 42.45\n  18:00: 42.976 -> 42.98\n  19:00: 43.53 -> 43.53 (but wait, 43.53 is 43.530, so 43.53) -> but the average was 43.53? Actually, 217.65/5=43.53 exactly? Let me check: 44.46+45.01+43.77+44.69+39.72 = 217.65 -> 217.65/5=43.53 -> so 43.53\n  20:00: 43.866 -> 43.87\n  21:00: 40.946 -> 40.95\n  22:00: 39.532 -> 39.53\n  23:00: 37.348 -> 37.35\n\n But note: the average for hour 19:00 is exactly 43.53? \n  44.46+45.01 = 89.47\n  +43.77 = 133.24\n  +44.69 = 177.93\n  +39.72 = 217.65 -> 217.65/5 = 43.53 -> so 43.53\n\n So we output:\n\n   2013/9/17 0:00 36.29\n   2013/9/17 1:00 35.44\n   2013/9/17 2:00 35.07\n   2013/9/17 3:00 35.13\n   2013/9/17 4:00 35.57\n   2013/9/17 5:00 37.21\n   2013/9/17 6:00 40.16\n   2013/9/17 7:00 43.83\n   2013/9/17 8:00 45.43\n   2013/9/17 9:00 45.85\n   2013/9/17 10:00 45.49\n   2013/9/17 11:00 45.51\n   2013/9/17 12:00 45.30\n   2013/9/17 13:00 43.95\n   2013/9/17 14:00 42.64\n   2013/9/17 15:00 42.09\n   2013/9/17 16:00 42.12\n   2013/9/17 17:00 42.45\n   2013/9/17 18:00 42.98\n   2013/9/17 19:00 43.53\n   2013/9/17 20:00 43.87\n   2013/9/17 21:00 40.95\n   2013/9/17 22:00 39.53\n   2013/9/17 23:00 37.35\n\n However, note: the date format in the input uses a space between date and time, and the date is in the format \"YYYY/M/D\" (without leading zeros for month and day). We'll use the same format.\n\n But note: 2013/9/17 is the next day.\n\n Let me write the answer in the required format.\n\n Important: The answer must be enclosed in <answer> and </answer> tags, and each line should be the date and time and the forecasted value (with two decimal places).\n\n Example:\n   <answer>\n   2013/9/17 0:00 36.29\n   2013/9/17 1:00 35.44\n   ...\n   </answer>\n",
