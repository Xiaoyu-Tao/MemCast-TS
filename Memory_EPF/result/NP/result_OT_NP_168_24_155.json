        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-12-22 00:00 to 2015-12-28 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-12-29 00:00 to 2015-12-29 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 consecutive hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n 3. Given the data, we observe:\n    - Strong daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Also, note that the data includes Christmas (Dec 24-25) which might have different patterns.\n\n Approach:\n We are to forecast 24 hours ahead. We can use a seasonal model. Given the daily seasonality, we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day as the forecast for the same hour in the next day.\n    - However, we note that the pattern on Christmas (Dec 25) and the day after might be different. But the next day (Dec 29) is a Tuesday, so we might look at the same day of the week.\n\n But note: the data we have ends on 2015-12-28 (Monday). The next 24 hours are 2015-12-29 (Tuesday). We can look at the previous Tuesday (2015-12-22) for a pattern? However, the week of Christmas might be different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing. But given the strong seasonality, we can use:\n\n    Forecast for hour h on day d = average of the same hour h for the last k days (excluding holidays? but we don't have holiday info)\n\n However, without more data and without exogenous variables, we have to keep it simple.\n\n Considering the data, we see that the price on 2015-12-28 (Monday) was significantly higher than the previous days (especially during the day). This might be because it was the first working day after Christmas? \n\n Since we are only required to forecast the next 24 hours, and we have 7 days of data, we can use:\n\n    y_{t+24} = y_t   [Seasonal Naive: using the same hour exactly one day ago]\n\n But note: the pattern on Monday (2015-12-28) was very different from Sunday (2015-12-27). So if we use the previous day (Monday) to forecast Tuesday, it might be more similar than using the same day last week.\n\n However, we note that the prices on Monday (2015-12-28) were unusually high. It might be that the market is returning to normal after the holidays. \n\n Let's compare:\n\n    Monday (2015-12-28): \n        0:00 15.12, 1:00 15.05, ... 23:00 14.98\n\n    The day before (Monday) was a working day? and the next day (Tuesday) is also a working day.\n\n    We also have data for the previous Tuesday (2015-12-22) which was a normal working day? (but note that 2015-12-24 is Christmas Eve, so the week might be atypical).\n\n    Since we don't have more context, a safe approach is to use the most recent day (Monday) as the base for Tuesday, but adjusted by the typical daily pattern relative to Monday? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 2-3 days? \n\n    However, the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (none in the given data) and provide the next 24 hours.\n\n    Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n        Use the values from the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) as the forecast, but adjusted by the ratio (or difference) of the most recent day (Monday) to the same day a week ago (Monday a week ago).\n\n    But note: \n        Last Monday was 2015-12-21? We don't have that. Our data starts on 2015-12-22 (Tuesday). So we have:\n\n        - 2015-12-22 (Tuesday) -> we are forecasting 2015-12-29 (Tuesday) which is 7 days later.\n\n    However, the week of Christmas might have different patterns. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 3 same hours? \n\n    Let me try a simple method: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) as the forecast for Tuesday? \n\n    But note: the pattern on Monday was very high during the day (peaked at 29.89) and then dropped. The previous days (Sunday, Saturday) were lower.\n\n    Since we don't have any information about the future grid load or wind, and we are only using the historical prices, we must rely on the recent pattern.\n\n    Considering the data shows a weekly pattern and a daily pattern, and we have exactly 7 days of data (so we have one full week of data, but including holidays), we can do:\n\n        Forecast for 2015-12-29 00:00: \n            Option 1: Use the value from 2015-12-22 00:00 (which was 4.79) -> but that was a week ago and the level has changed? \n            Option 2: Use the value from 2015-12-28 00:00 (15.12) -> but that was a Monday and now we are forecasting Tuesday.\n\n    How about: use the average of the same hour for the last two days (Sunday and Monday) for the same hour? \n\n    For example, for 00:00: \n        Sunday (2015-12-27 00:00): 15.12\n        Monday (2015-12-28 00:00): 15.12? Actually, wait: \n            Sunday 00:00: 15.12? Actually, the data for 2015-12-27 00:00 is 11.92? \n            Correction: \n                2015-12-27 00:00: 11.92? \n                But the data for 2015-12-28 00:00: 15.12\n\n        Actually, the data:\n\n            2015-12-27 00:00: 11.92? \n            But in the data: \n                \"2015/12/27 0:00 11.92\"\n                \"2015/12/28 0:00 15.12\"\n\n        So for 00:00, we have:\n            Sunday: 11.92\n            Monday: 15.12\n\n        Then for Tuesday 00:00, we might take: (11.92 + 15.12) / 2 = 13.52\n\n    But note: the pattern on Monday was much higher. Maybe we should use only Monday? \n\n    However, the problem is that we don't know if Monday was an anomaly or the new normal. \n\n    Another idea: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) as the forecast for Tuesday? \n\n    Why? Because the daily pattern might be similar for consecutive working days.\n\n    But note: the data on Monday (2015-12-28) was a spike. It might be that the prices are returning to normal after the holidays. \n\n    Considering the entire week:\n\n        Dec 22 (Tue): prices were moderate (max around 16.35)\n        Dec 23 (Wed): similar to Tue, but a bit lower\n        Dec 24 (Thu, Christmas Eve): dropped significantly in the evening\n        Dec 25 (Fri, Christmas): low during the night, then moderate during the day\n        Dec 26 (Sat): moderate\n        Dec 27 (Sun): moderate to high\n        Dec 28 (Mon): high during the day, then dropped in the evening\n\n    We are forecasting Dec 29 (Tue). It might be that the market returns to a pattern similar to the previous Tuesday (Dec 22) but at a higher level? \n\n    Without more data, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from the last two days and the same day last week? \n\n    However, to keep it simple and given the instructions, I will use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h on Dec 29 = value of hour h on Dec 28 (the previous day) \n\n    Why? Because the most recent day is the most relevant, and we don't have any information to suggest a different pattern for Tuesday.\n\n    But note: the price on Monday was unusually high. However, without any additional information, we assume that the conditions that caused the high prices on Monday (like high demand, low wind, etc.) might persist.\n\n    Therefore, we will use the same hour from the previous day (2015-12-28) as the forecast for 2015-12-29.\n\n    So:\n\n        2015-12-29 00:00 -> 15.12 (from 2015-12-28 00:00) -> but wait, the value for 2015-12-28 00:00 is 15.12? Actually, the data for 2015-12-28 00:00 is 15.12, but we have:\n\n        The last 24 hours of data (from 00:00 to 23:00 on 2015-12-28) are:\n\n            00:00: 15.12\n            01:00: 15.05\n            02:00: 15.16\n            03:00: 15.28\n            04:00: 15.97\n            05:00: 17.97\n            06:00: 19.27\n            07:00: 24.25\n            08:00: 27.25\n            09:00: 29.89\n            10:00: 28.06\n            11:00: 27.94\n            12:00: 26.27\n            13:00: 24.83\n            14:00: 24.07\n            15:00: 26.43\n            16:00: 26.28\n            17:00: 25.34\n            18:00: 20.21\n            19:00: 18.63\n            20:00: 17.60\n            21:00: 16.88\n            22:00: 15.87\n            23:00: 14.98\n\n        So we will use these same values for the next day (2015-12-29) at the same hours.\n\n    However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we should handle the data carefully. This method is very simple and might not capture the weekly pattern. But it is a common baseline.\n\n    Alternatively, we could adjust by the difference between the same day last week and the current level? But we don't have the same day last week for Tuesday (we have Dec 22, but that was a week ago and the level was lower). \n\n    Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables, I will use the Seasonal Naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours (i.e., using the previous day's same hour).\n\n    Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2015-12-29 00:00 to 2015-12-29 23:00) is the same as the prices on 2015-12-28 00:00 to 2015-12-28 23:00.\n\n    But note: the data for 2015-12-28 is already provided? Yes, it is the last 24 hours of the historical data.\n\n    So:\n\n        2015-12-29 00:00: 15.12\n        2015-12-29 01:00: 15.05\n        ... until ...\n        2015-12-29 23:00: 14.98\n\n    However, we must note that this might not be the best forecast because the pattern on Monday (Dec 28) was a spike and Tuesday might be different. But without more information, we use this.\n\n    Another common method is to use the average of the same hour over the last few days (e.g., 3 days). Let's try for 00:00:\n\n        Last 3 days at 00:00:\n            Dec 26: 2015-12-26 00:00 -> 10.11\n            Dec 27: 2015-12-27 00:00 -> 11.92\n            Dec 28: 2015-12-28 00:00 -> 15.12\n            Average = (10.11+11.92+15.12)/3 = 12.38\n\n    But then we see that the prices have been increasing. So for 00:00, 12.38 might be too low? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing? But we are not given a model.\n\n    Given the instructions and the need to provide a forecast, I will stick to the simple method of using the previous day (24-hour lag) because it is common and we have no other information.\n\n    Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours is:\n\n        2015-12-29 00:00: 15.12\n        2015-12-29 01:00: 15.05\n        2015-12-29 02:00: 15.16\n        2015-12-29 03:00: 15.28\n        2015-12-29 04:00: 15.97\n        2015-12-29 05:00: 17.97\n        2015-12-29 06:00: 19.27\n        2015-12-29 07:00: 24.25\n        2015-12-29 08:00: 27.25\n        2015-12-29 09:00: 29.89\n        2015-12-29 10:00: 28.06\n        2015-12-29 11:00: 27.94\n        2015-12-29 12:00: 26.27\n        2015-12-29 13:00: 24.83\n        2015-12-29 14:00: 24.07\n        2015-12-29 15:00: 26.43\n        2015-12-29 16:00: 26.28\n        2015-12-29 17:00: 25.34\n        2015-12-29 18:00: 20.21\n        2015-12-29 19:00: 18.63\n        2015-12-29 20:00: 17.60\n        2015-12-29 21:00: 16.88\n        2015-12-29 22:00: 15.87\n        2015-12-29 23:00: 14.98\n\n    We output these 24 values.\n\n    However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. There are no missing values in the provided data, so we don't need to impute.\n\n    We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n    Important: The dates in the forecast should be for 2015-12-29 00:00 to 2015-12-29 23:00.\n\n    Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2015/12/29 0:00 15.12\n        2015/12/29 1:00 15.05\n        ... \n        2015/12/29 23:00 14.98\n        </answer>\n\n    But note: the historical data format uses a space between the date and the time? Actually, the example:\n\n        \"2015/12/22 0:00  4.79\"\n\n    We have two spaces between the time and the value? Actually, in the given data, the alignment is done with spaces, but the actual separator is a space. We can use one space.\n\n    We'll output:\n\n        [date] [hour] [value]\n\n    For example: \"2015/12/29 0:00 15.12\"\n\n    We must output 24 lines.\n\n    Let's write the forecast:\n\n        We are forecasting for 2015-12-29, which is the next day after 2015-12-28.\n\n    Note: the hour format in the input uses \"0:00\", \"1:00\", ... \"23:00\". We follow the same.\n\n    Therefore, the complete forecast:\n",
