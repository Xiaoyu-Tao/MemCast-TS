        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-06-21 00:00 to 2016-06-27 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2016-06-28 00:00 to 2016-06-28 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the target variable (OT: observed price) and the date. The problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are not provided with that for the future. Therefore, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the historical prices and no exogenous variables for the future, we can use a univariate model. Given the daily seasonality (evident from the data: prices are higher during the day and lower at night) and the short-term nature, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) - but we have to determine the parameters.\n Option 2: Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that can capture seasonality.\n Option 3: A simple approach: average of the same hour in the past few days.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - A weekly pattern? Let's check: the last day (2016-06-27) is a Monday and the next 24 hours are for 2016-06-28 (Tuesday). We have data for the previous week (from 2016-06-21, which was a Tuesday, to 2016-06-27 Monday). But note: 2016-06-25 and 2016-06-26 are weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and we see lower prices.\n\n Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2016-06-21) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n But note: the problem does not to skip any values and we must provide 24 values.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables, we can use a method that uses the average of the same hour from the last few days (with adjustment for the day of the week). However, we only have one week of data. We have:\n\n   Tuesday (2016-06-21): 24 hours\n   Wednesday (2016-06-22): 24 hours\n   Thursday (2016-06-23): 24 hours\n   Friday (2016-06-24): 24 hours\n   Saturday (2016-06-25): 24 hours\n   Sunday (2016-06-26): 24 hours\n   Monday (2016-06-27): 24 hours\n\n We are forecasting for Tuesday (2016-06-28). We can take the average of the same hour for the previous week (only one Tuesday: 2016-06-21) and then adjust with the recent trend? But one data point for the same day of the week is not enough.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the last 7 days for the same hour? But note: the weekend days are different. We can do:\n\n   For each hour (0 to 23) of the day, we take the average of that hour for the last 3 weekdays (if we are forecasting a weekday) and the last 2 weekend days (if we are forecasting a weekend day). But our forecast day is a Tuesday (weekday). We can use:\n\n   - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2016-06-21)\n   - The previous day (Monday, 2016-06-27) and the day before that (Sunday, 2016-06-26) might be less representative.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days and also to the same day of the previous week.\n\n However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (which we don't have in the history) and provide a forecast.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   Use a simple average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which would be Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). But Tuesday was 7 days ago and might be less relevant.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing method that uses the entire history and captures seasonality. But without a library, we have to do it manually.\n\n Considering the time and the requirement for 24 values, I will use:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) on the forecast day (Tuesday, 28th):\n        forecast = (value of hour h on 2016-06-27 (Monday) * 0.4 +\n                    value of hour h on 2016-06-26 (Sunday) * 0.1 +\n                    value of hour h on 2016-06-25 (Saturday) * 0.1 +\n                    value of hour h on 2016-06-24 (Friday) * 0.1 +\n                    value of hour h on 2016-06-23 (Thursday) * 0.1 +\n                    value of hour h on 2016-06-22 (Wednesday) * 0.1 +\n                    value of hour h on 2016-06-21 (Tuesday) * 0.2)\n\n   Why these weights? The most recent day (Monday) is given the highest weight (0.4) because it's the most relevant. The same day last week (Tuesday) is given 0.2. The other days are given 0.1 each (and 0.1*5=0.5, so total 0.4+0.2+0.5=1.1 -> that doesn't add to 1). Let me adjust:\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Monday (1 day ago): 0.4\n        Sunday (2 days ago): 0.2\n        Saturday (3 days ago): 0.15\n        Friday (4 days ago): 0.1\n        Thursday (5 days ago): 0.05\n        Wednesday (6 days ago): 0.05\n        Tuesday (7 days ago): 0.05\n\n   But then the same day last week (Tuesday) is only 0.05? Maybe we should give more.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simpler method: use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday) and the same day last week? But note: Monday is the most recent and a weekday, and the previous Tuesday is the same day.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days, but that would include weekend days which are different.\n\n   Given the complexity, I will use:\n\n        forecast = (Monday (same hour) * 0.5 + \n                    same hour from the previous Tuesday * 0.3 +\n                    average of the same hour for the days in between (Wednesday to Sunday) * 0.2) \n\n   But the average of the days in between for that hour would be (Wed+Thu+Fri+Sat+Sun)/5.\n\n   So for each hour h in [0,23]:\n   v1 = value of hour h on 2016-06-27 (Monday)\n   v2 = value of hour h on 2016-06-21 (Tuesday)\n   v3 = (value of hour h on 2016-06-22 + 2016-06-23 + 2016-06-24 + 2016-06-25 + 2016-06-26) / 5\n\n   forecast_h = 0.5 * v1 + 0.3 * v2 + 0.2 * v3\n\n This way, we give 50% weight to the most recent day (Monday), 30% to the same day last week, and 20% to the average of the rest of the week.\n\n However, note that the weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) are more similar to Tuesday than the weekend (Saturday, Sunday). So we might want to adjust by taking only weekdays? But our forecast day is a Tuesday (weekday). So we can take the average of the weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and ignore the weekend? But then we have only 3 days. Alternatively, we can separate weekdays and weekends.\n\n But for simplicity, I will use the above formula.\n\n Let's test for one hour: hour 0 (midnight) of the forecast day (2016-06-28 00:00):\n\n   Monday (2016-06-27 00:00): 23.65\n   Tuesday (2016-06-21 00:00): 24.28\n   Average of the rest (Wed 00:00: 25.69, Thu 00:00: 25.28, Fri 00:00: 24.87, Sat 00:00: 25.32, Sun 00:00: 23.90) \n        = (25.69+25.28+24.87+25.32+23.90)/5 = 124.06/5 = 24.812\n\n   Then forecast = 0.5*23.65 + 0.3*24.28 + 0.2*24.812\n        = 11.825 + 7.284 + 4.9624 = 24.0714\n\n We can round to two decimals: 24.07\n\n But note: the data has two decimal places.\n\n We'll do this for each hour.\n\n However, note that the data for the last Monday (2016-06-27) is a weekday and the previous Tuesday (2016-06-21) is also a weekday. The rest of the days include two weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri) and two weekend days (Sat, Sun). So the average of the rest might be pulled down by the weekend. We are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday), so we might want to use only the weekdays in the average? But then we have:\n\n   For the rest: only Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (3 days) and skip Saturday and Sunday? \n\n   Then for hour 0:\n        v3 = (25.69 (Wed) + 25.28 (Thu) + 24.87 (Fri)) / 3 = 75.84/3 = 25.28\n\n   Then forecast = 0.5*23.65 + 0.3*24.28 + 0.2*25.28\n        = 11.825 + 7.284 + 5.056 = 24.165 -> 24.17\n\n Which one is better? It depends. Since Tuesday is a weekday, it is more similar to other weekdays. So I will use only the weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri) for the middle average.\n\n Revised formula for each hour h:\n\n   v1 = value of hour h on Monday (2016-06-27)\n   v2 = value of hour h on the previous Tuesday (2016-06-21)\n   v3 = average of hour h on the weekdays between (i.e., Wednesday, Thursday, Friday: 2016-06-22, 2016-06-23, 2016-06-24)\n\n   forecast_h = 0.5 * v1 + 0.3 * v2 + 0.2 * v3\n\n We'll compute for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n Let's do the calculation for the first hour (0:00) as above: 24.17\n\n Now, we need to do for all 24 hours.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n\n   Look up the value at the same hour on:\n        2016-06-27 (Monday) -> column OT for that hour\n        2016-06-21 (Tuesday) -> column OT for that hour\n        and the average of the same hour on 2016-06-22 (Wed), 2016-06-23 (Thu), 2016-06-24 (Fri)\n\n   Then compute: 0.5 * (Monday) + 0.3 * (last Tuesday) + 0.2 * (average of Wed, Thu, Fri)\n\n We'll write the forecast for 2016-06-28 from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n Let's do the data extraction:\n\n   Monday (2016-06-27) hours 0-23: \n        0:00: 23.65\n        1:00: 22.09\n        2:00: 20.26\n        3:00: 20.49\n        4:00: 21.04\n
