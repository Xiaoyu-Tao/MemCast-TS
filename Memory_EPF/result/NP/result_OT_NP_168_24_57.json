        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/2/4 0:00 to 2014/2/10 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/2/11 0:00 to 2014/2/11 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 consecutive hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on a time series model that uses only the historical prices.\n 3. Given the data is at hourly resolution and we need to forecast 24 hours, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns (since we have 7 days of data).\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective model for short-term forecasting: \n   - We note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (prices are higher during the day and lower at night, with peaks in the morning and evening).\n   - We can use a seasonal naive approach: using the same hour from the previous day as the forecast. However, we note that the pattern might change from weekday to weekend.\n\n But note: \n   - The last day in the data is Monday (2014/2/10). The next day is Tuesday (2014/2/11). \n   - We can look at the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2014/2/4) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n However, the data provided is from 2014/2/4 (Tuesday) to 2014/2/10 (Monday). So the next 24 hours (2014/2/11) is a Tuesday.\n\n We can consider:\n   Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (2014/2/4) as the forecast for 2014/2/11? But note that 2014/2/4 was a Tuesday of the previous week, and we have 7 days of data. However, the pattern might not be exactly the same.\n\n   Option 2: Use an average of the same hour of the last few Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2014/2/4) in the data.\n\n   Option 3: Use the last 7 days to compute the average for each hour? But note that the last 7 days include both weekdays and weekend (from Tuesday to Monday). The next day is Tuesday, so we can take the average of the same hour for the previous Tuesday and the previous Monday? That might not be ideal.\n\n   Option 4: Since we have only 7 days, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing that accounts for daily seasonality.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only using the target variable, we can use a seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours, but adjusted by the day of the week.\n\n However, note that the problem does not provide any other features, so we must rely on the target series.\n\n Considering the above, we can do:\n\n   - We note that the data from 2014/2/4 (Tuesday) and 2014/2/11 (next Tuesday) might be similar, but we also have the data from the last day (Monday, 2014/2/10) which is the most recent.\n\n   - We can use a weighted average of the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and the same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday). For example:\n\n        Forecast for 2014/2/11 0:00 = (w1 * OT at 2014/2/10 0:00 + w2 * OT at 2014/2/4 0:00) / (w1+w2)\n\n   - How to choose weights? We can give more weight to the most recent day (Monday) because it is closer in time. For example, w1=2, w2=1.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three same hours (from the same day of the week) but we only have one previous Tuesday.\n\n   - Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include different days of the week.\n\n   - We can see that the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) might have a different pattern than the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). The next day is a weekday (Tuesday). So we can take the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the last week? But we only have one Tuesday, one Wednesday, etc.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust it by the difference between the same hour of the previous Tuesday and the previous Tuesday's previous day (Monday a week ago). \n\n   However, due to the simplicity and the limited data, I propose:\n\n        Forecast for hour h (0 to 23) on 2014/2/11 = \n            (2 * value at hour h on 2014/2/10 (Monday) + \n             1 * value at hour h on 2014/2/4 (Tuesday)) / 3\n\n   Why 2 and 1? Because the most recent day (Monday) is more relevant than the same day a week ago (Tuesday). \n\n   But note: the data from 2014/2/4 (Tuesday) is 7 days ago, and the data from 2014/2/10 (Monday) is 1 day ago.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing with a seasonal component. But without a library, we can do a simple average.\n\n   Let me check the pattern:\n\n        On 2014/2/4 (Tuesday): \n          0:00: 29.55\n          1:00: 29.39\n          ... \n          17:00: 37.68   (peak)\n\n        On 2014/2/10 (Monday):\n          0:00: 26.54\n          1:00: 26.37\n          ...\n          17:00: 34.60\n\n        We see that the Monday pattern is similar to the Tuesday pattern? But the peak on Monday (34.60) is lower than the peak on the previous Tuesday (37.68). \n\n        Also, the prices on the last day (Monday) are generally lower than the previous Tuesday.\n\n   How about we use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But we have:\n\n        Weekdays: \n          Tuesday (2014/2/4), Wednesday (2014/2/5), Thursday (2014/2/6), Friday (2014/2/7), Monday (2014/2/10)\n\n        Note: Monday is the next weekday after Sunday, but in terms of the week, it is the day before Tuesday.\n\n        We are forecasting a Tuesday. We can take the average of the same hour for the last Tuesday (2014/2/4) and the most recent weekday (Monday, 2014/2/10) and also the Friday (2014/2/7) which is the last weekday before the weekend? \n\n        However, we have only one Tuesday.\n\n   Given the above, I will stick to the weighted average of the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and the same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) with weights 2 and 1.\n\n   Therefore, the forecast for each hour h (from 0 to 23) on 2014/2/11 is:\n\n        forecast_h = (2 * value_h_on_2014_02_10 + value_h_on_2014_02_04) / 3\n\n   But note: the data for 2014/2/4 starts at 0:00 and ends at 23:00, and 2014/2/10 also has 24 hours.\n\n   We can compute:\n\n        For hour 0:00: (2*26.54 + 29.55)/3 = (53.08 + 29.55)/3 = 82.63/3 = 27.54333 -> round to 2 decimals: 27.54\n        For hour 1:00: (2*26.37 + 29.39)/3 = (52.74 + 29.39)/3 = 82.13/3 = 27.37667 -> 27.38\n        ... and so on.\n\n   However, we must consider that the data might have a trend? But 7 days is short. Alternatively, we can adjust by the overall level of the last day compared to the same day last week? \n\n   Another idea: instead of fixed weights, we can adjust by the ratio of the average of the last day to the average of the same day last week? \n\n        Let avg_last_monday = average of 2014/2/10\n        Let avg_last_tuesday = average of 2014/2/4\n\n        Then, we can scale the last tuesday's data by (avg_last_monday / avg_last_tuesday) to bring it to the current level?\n\n        But note: 2014/2/10 is Monday and 2014/2/4 is Tuesday, so we are comparing different days. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the ratio of the entire week? \n\n   Given the complexity and the requirement for a simple method, I will stick to the weighted average without scaling.\n\n   However, let me compute the average for 2014/2/4 and 2014/2/10:\n\n        2014/2/4: average = (sum of 24 hours)/24 -> we can compute quickly:\n\n        We can skip the exact average because we are doing per hour. \n\n   But note: the data for 2014/2/10 is generally lower than 2014/2/4. So if we use the same hour from 2014/2/4 without scaling, it might be too high.\n\n   We can adjust the Tuesday data by a factor: factor = (average of 2014/2/10) / (average of 2014/2/4)\n\n        avg_2014_02_04 = (29.55+29.39+28.36+28.80+29.99+30.98+31.93+33.49+33.72+33.55+33.75+33.64+33.42+33.50+33.47+33.31+33.74+37.68+34.82+33.27+32.57+32.04+31.58+31.31) / 24\n        Let me compute:\n\n            Sum = 29.55+29.39 = 58.94\n            +28.36 -> 87.30\n            +28.80 -> 116.10\n            +29.99 -> 146.09\n            +30.98 -> 177.07\n            +31.93 -> 209.00\n            +33.49 -> 242.49\n            +33.72 -> 276.21\n            +33.55 -> 309.76\n            +33.75 -> 343.51\n            +33.64 -> 377.15\n            +33.42 -> 410.57\n            +33.50 -> 444.07\n            +33.47 -> 477.54\n            +33.31 -> 510.85\n            +33.74 -> 544.59\n            +37.68 -> 582.27\n            +34.82 -> 617.09\n            +33.27 -> 650.36\n            +32.57 -> 682.93\n            +32.04 -> 714.97\n            +31.58 -> 746.55\n            +31.31 -> 777.86\n\n            Average = 777.86 / 24 = 32.410833\n\n        Similarly, 2014/2/10:\n\n            26.54, 26.37, 25.99, 26.02, 26.78, 29.60, 31.62, 32.43, 32.79, 32.45, 32.69, 32.40, 32.61, 32.47, 32.60, 32.88, 33.26, 34.60, 33.80, 32.91, 32.31, 31.87, 31.06, 29.91\n\n            Sum = 26.54+26.37=52.91\n            +25.99 -> 78.90\n            +26.02 -> 104.92\n            +26.78 -> 131.70\n            +29.60 -> 161.30\n            +31.62 -> 192.92\n            +32.43 -> 225.35\n            +32.79 -> 258.14\n            +32.45 -> 290.59\n            +32.69 -> 323.28\n            +32.40 -> 355.68\n            +32.61 -> 388.29\n            +32.47 -> 420.76\n            +32.60 -> 453.36\n            +32.88 -> 486.24\n            +33.26 -> 519.50\n            +34.60 -> 554.10\n            +33.80 -> 587.90\n            +32.91 -> 620.81\n            +32.31 -> 653.12\n            +31.87 -> 684.99\n            +31.06 -> 716.05\n            +29.91 -> 745.96\n\n            Average = 745.96 / 24 = 31.081667\n\n        Factor = 31.081667 / 32.410833 = 0.959\n\n        So we can scale the Tuesday (2014/2/4) data by 0.959 to adjust for the overall level.\n\n        Then the forecast for hour h:\n\n            forecast_h = (2 * value_h_on_2014_02_10 + 0.959 * value_h_on_2014_02_04) / (2+0.959) \n            = (2 * value_h_on_2014_02_10 + 0.959 * value_h_on_2014_02_04) / 2.959\n\n        For 0:00: \n            = (2*26.54 + 0.959*29.55) / 2.959\n            = (53.08 + 28.33) / 2.959   [0.959*29.55 = 28.33 (rounded to 2 decimals? let me compute: 0.959*29.55 = 28.33 (exactly: 0.959*29.55 = 28.33045 -> 28.33))\n            = 81.41 / 2.959 = 27.51\n\n        But note: we are using a factor that is computed from the entire day, and we are applying it to each hour. This might be reasonable.\n\n   However, we can also compute the factor for each hour? That would be too variable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the weighted average without scaling and then adjust the entire forecast by the ratio of the last day's average to the average of the two days? \n\n   Given the time, I will use the scaled version.\n\n   Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n\n        Let v1 = value at hour h on 2014/2/10 (Monday)\n        Let v2 = value at hour h on 2014/2/4 (Tuesday)\n\n        factor = 31.081667 / 32.410833 = 0.959 (we'll use 0.959)\n\n        forecast_h = (2 * v1 + 0.959 * v2) / (2 + 0.959) = (2*v1 + 0.959*v2) / 2.959\n\n   We round to 2 decimal places.\n\n   Let's compute the 24 hours:\n\n        Hour 0: (2*26.54 + 0.959*29.55) = 53.08 + 28.33 = 81.41 -> 81.41/2.959 = 27.51\n        Hour 1: (2*26.37 + 0.959*29.39) = 52.74 + 28.19 = 80.93 -> 80.93/2.959 = 27.35\n        Hour 2: (2*25.99 + 0.959*28.36) = 51.98 + 27.20 = 79.18 -> 79.18/2.959 = 26.76\n        Hour 3: (2*26.02 + 0.959*28.80) = 52.04 + 27.62 = 79.66 -> 79.66/2.959 = 26.92\n        Hour 4: (2*26.78 + 0.959*29.99) = 53.56 + 28.76 = 82.32 -> 82.32/2.959 = 27.82\n        Hour 5: (2*29.60 + 0.959*30.98) = 59.20 + 29.71 = 88.91 -> 88.91/2.959 = 30.05\n        Hour 6: (2*31.62 + 0.959*31.93) = 63.24 + 30.62 = 93.86 -> 93.86/2.959 = 31.72\n        Hour 7: (2*32.43 + 0.959*33.49) = 64.86 + 32.12 = 96.98 -> 96.98/2.959 = 32.77\n        Hour 8: (2*32.79 + 0.959*33.72) = 65.58 + 32.34 = 97.92 -> 97.92/2.959 = 33.09\n        Hour 9: (2*32.45 + 0.959*33.55) = 64.90 + 32.18 = 97.08 -> 97.08/2.959 = 32.81\n        Hour 10: (2*32.69 + 0.959*33.75) = 65.38 + 32.37 = 97.75 -> 97.75/2.959 = 33.03\n        Hour 11: (2*32.40 + 0.959*33.64) = 64.80 + 32.26 = 97.06 -> 97.06/2.959 = 32.80\n        Hour 12: (2*32.61 + 0.959*33.42) = 65.22 + 32.05 = 97.27 -> 97.27/2.959 = 32.87\n        Hour 13: (2*32.47 + 0.959*33.50) = 64.94 + 32.13 = 97.07 -> 97.07/2.959 = 32.80\n        Hour 14: (2*32.60 + 0.959*33.47) = 65.20 + 32.10 = 97.30 -> 97.30/2.959 = 32.88\n        Hour 15: (2*32.88 + 0.959*33.31) = 65.76 + 31.95 = 97.71 -> 97.71/2.959 = 33.02\n        Hour 16: (2*33.26 + 0.959*33.74) = 66.52 + 32.36 = 98.88 -> 98.88/2.959 = 33.42\n        Hour 17: (2*34.60 + 0.959*37.68) = 69.20 + 36.14 = 105.34 -> 105.34/2.959 = 35.60\n        Hour 18: (2*33.80 + 0.959*34.82) = 67.60 + 33.39 = 100.99 -> 100.99/2.959 = 34.13\n        Hour 19: (2*32.91 + 0.959*33.27) = 65.82 + 31.91 = 97.73 -> 97.73/2.959 = 33.03\n        Hour 20: (2*32.31 + 0.959*32.57) = 64.62 + 31.24 = 95.86 -> 95.86/2.959 = 32.40\n        Hour 21: (2*31.87 + 0.959*32.04) = 63.74 + 30.73 = 94.47 -> 94.47/2.959 = 31.93\n        Hour 22: (2*31.06 + 0.959*31.58) = 62.12 + 30.29 = 92.41 -> 92.41/2.959 = 31.23\n        Hour 23: (2*29.91 + 0.959*31.31) = 59.82 + 30.03 = 89.85 -> 89.85/2.959 = 30.37\n\n   But note: the factor 0.959 is an overall factor.

But we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n   This method is a simple heuristic.\n\n   However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but there are none. \n\n   We are to provide the next 24 hours: from 2014/2/11 0:00 to 2014/2/11 23:00.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        2014/2/11 0:00 27.51\n        2014/2/11 1:00 27.35\n        2014/2/11 2:00 26.76\n        2014/2/11 3:00 26.92\n        2014/2/11 4:00 27.82\n        2014/2/11 5:00 30.05\n        2014/2/11 6:00 31.72\n        2014/2/11 7:00 32.77\n        2014/2/11 8:00 33.09\n        2014/2/11 9:00 32.81\n        2014/2/11 10:00 33.03\n        2014/2/11 11:00 32.80\n        2014/2/11 12:00 32.87\n        2014/2/11 13:00 32.80\n        2014/2/11 14:00 32.88\n        2014/2/11 15:00 33.02\n        2014/2/11 16:00 33.42\n        2014/2/11 17:00 35.60\n        2014/2/11 18:00 34.13\n        2014/2/11 19:00 33.03\n        2014/2/11 20:00 32.40\n        2014/2/11 21:00 31.93\n        2014/2/11 22:00 31.23\n        2014/2/11 23:00 30.37\n\n   However, note that the peak at hour 17:00 is 35.60, which is between the Monday's 34.60 and the Tuesday's 37.68 (scaled to 36.14) and then averaged with weights.\n\n   This seems reasonable.\n\n   But note: we are not considered any trend. The last week shows a general decrease? But we are only forecasting one day.\n\n   We'll go with this.\n\n   Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n          2014/2/11 0:00 27.51\n          2014/2/11 1:00 27.35\n          ... \n        </answer>\n\n   We must output 24 lines.\n\n   Let me write the exact values with two decimal places as computed.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        factor = 0.959   (exactly: 31.081667/32.410833 = 0.959, but we can use more precise? \n        Actually, we computed the averages to 6 decimals, so factor = 31.081667/32.410833 = 0.959 (approx)\n\n        But to be precise, let me compute factor = 745.96 / 777.86 = 0.9588 (if we use the exact sums we computed: 745.96 and 777.86)\n\n        factor = 745.96 / 777.86 = 0.9588\n\n        Then for each hour:\n\n        forecast_h = (2 * v1 + 0.9588 * v2) / (2+0.9588) = (2*v1 + 0.9588*v2) / 2.9588\n\n   We'll recalc with this factor to be more precise.\n\n   Hour 0: \n        v1 = 26.54, v2 = 29.55\n        numerator = 2*26.54 + 0.9588*29.55 = 53.08 + 28.33074 = 81.41074\n        denominator = 2.9588\n        forecast = 81.41074 / 2.9588 = 27.51 (rounded to 2 decimals: 81.41074 / 2.9588 = 27.512 -> 27.51)\n\n   Actually, the rounding might be consistent.\n\n   We'll do the same for all.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the factor 0.959 as an approximation and then round to two decimals.\n\n   Since the original data is given with two decimals, we can do the same.\n\n   I'll stick to the factor 0.959 for simplicity.\n\n   The computed above are with 0.959.\n\n   We'll output the 24 values as computed.\n\n   Note: The problem does not to omit any values, so we output all 24.\n\n   Let me write the full list:\n\n        0:00: 27.51\n        1:00: 27.35\n        2:00: 26.76\n        3:00: 26.92\n        4:00: 27.82\n        5:00: 30.05\n        6:00: 31.72\n        7:00: 32.77\n        8:00: 33.09\n        9:00: 32.81\n        10:00: 33.03\n        11:00: 32.80\n        12:00: 32.87\n        13:00: 32.80\n        14:00: 32.88\n        15:00: 33.02\n        16:00: 33.42\n        17:00: 35.60\n        18:00: 34.13\n        19:00: 33.03\n        20:00: 32.40\n        21:00: 31.93\n        22:00: 31.23\n        23:00: 30.37\n\n   We output in the same format as the input: \"YYYY/M/D H:MM value\"\n\n   The next day is 2014/2/11.\n\n   So:\n\n        2014/2/11 0:00 27.51\n        2014/2/11 1:00 27.35\n        ...\n\n   We write in the answer block.\n\n   Note: This is a simple method. In practice, we might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, etc.), but given the constraints, we use this heuristic.\n\n   We output the 24 hours.\n\n   Let me write the answer.\n",
