        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2017/1/10 0:00 to 2017/1/16 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2017/1/17 0:00 to 2017/1/17 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Since we don't have exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power) for the future, we must rely on the time series patterns.\n\n Approach:\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only provided with the price (OT) and no other features, we can use a time series model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - Weekly seasonality (168 hours) might be considered but we have only one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days, so we can try to capture daily patterns.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - A clear daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day, with peaks in the morning and evening.\n   - There is a spike on 2017/1/16 (Monday) which might be due to the start of the week.\n\n Since we are only allowed to use the given data and we are an expert, we can use a simple but effective method:\n\n Option 1: Use the average of the same hour from the previous days (e.g., average of the same hour over the last 7 days) to forecast the next day.\n\n But note: the data from 2017/1/16 (Monday) is the only Monday we have. The previous days are from Tuesday (2017/1/10) to Sunday (2017/1/15). \n We have:\n   - 2017/1/10: Tuesday\n   - 2017/1/11: Wednesday\n   - 2017/1/12: Thursday\n   - 2017/1/13: Friday\n   - 2017/1/14: Saturday\n   - 2017/1/15: Sunday\n   - 2017/1/16: Monday\n\n We are to forecast 2017/1/17: Tuesday.\n\n So we can use:\n   - The same hour of the previous week (2017/1/10, Tuesday) as a base, but adjusted by the recent trend.\n\n However, the recent Monday (2017/1/16) had a significant spike. We must consider if the same pattern will repeat on Tuesday? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the last few days, giving more weight to the most recent days and also to the same day of the previous week.\n\n But note: the problem does not provide any other variables (like load or wind) for the future, so we cannot use them.\n\n Given the constraints, a simple method is to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. However, we note that the pattern on Monday (2017/1/16) was very different. \n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we might consider:\n\n   - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2017/1/10) and then adjust by the average change from the previous week to the current week for the same day type.\n\n But we only have one Monday and one Tuesday in the data? Actually, we have one full week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which includes Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and then adjust for the day of the week? \n\n However, without more data, we can try:\n\n   - Use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) as a base, but note that Tuesday might be different.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the same day of the previous week and the same hour of the last day, but with weights.\n\n Since we are limited, we can do:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on 2017/1/17 (Tuesday) = \n        (Price of hour h on 2017/1/10 (Tuesday) * 0.5 + \n         Price of hour h on 2017/1/16 (Monday) * 0.3 +\n         Price of hour h on 2017/1/15 (Sunday) * 0.2)\n\n But the weights are arbitrary.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last 7 days for the same hour.\n\n Let's try with the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n However, note the spike on Monday: if we average, the spike will be included and might overestimate the Tuesday? \n\n But let's see: the spike was on Monday (2017/1/16) and we are forecasting Tuesday (2017/1/17). The spike might be a one-off? \n\n Since we don't have more context, we will use the 7-day average for each hour to forecast the next day.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of 2017/1/17:\n\n   For hour h (e.g., 0:00):\n        h0 = (h0 from 2017/1/10 + h0 from 2017/1/11 + ... + h0 from 2017/1/16) / 7\n\n But note: the data for 2017/1/10 is 7 days before 2017/1/17? Actually, 2017/1/17 is 7 days after 2017/1/10? \n   - 2017/1/10 (Tuesday) to 2017/1/17 (Tuesday) is exactly 7 days.\n\n So we can compute the average for hour h = (price_h on 2017/1/10 + price_h on 2017/1/11 + ... + price_h on 2017/1/16) / 7\n\n However, note that the days are from Tuesday to Monday (7 days). So we are averaging 7 days.\n\n But wait: the data we have for the same hour of the day over the last 7 days? Yes.\n\n But note: the spike on Monday might be an outlier? We could use median to be robust? But the problem says we are an expert, and we don't have a lot of data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median for each hour over the last 7 days? \n\n However, the problem does not specify the method. Since we are to provide a forecast, and the data has a clear daily pattern, we will use the 7-day average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (26.95, 25.35, 23.48, 29.01, 29.62, 28.81, 30.90) -> average = (26.95+25.35+23.48+29.01+29.62+28.81+30.90)/7\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data we have for 2017/1/16 is Monday, and we are forecasting Tuesday. The average might smooth out the spike? \n\n However, the spike on Monday was during the day (e.g., at 17:00 it was 81.05). For the same hour (17:00) in the previous days:\n\n   2017/1/10 17:00: 31.20\n   2017/1/11 17:00: 29.61\n   2017/1/12 17:00: 30.56\n   2017/1/13 17:00: 36.09\n   2017/1/14 17:00: 32.13\n   2017/1/15 17:00: 32.68\n   2017/1/16 17:00: 81.05\n\n   Average = (31.20+29.61+30.56+36.09+32.13+32.68+81.05)/7 = 273.32 / 7 = 39.0457\n\n This is higher than the previous Tuesdays, but we are forecasting for Tuesday, and the spike might be a one-time event? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the spike? The median of the above is: \n   Sort: 29.61, 30.56, 31.20, 32.13, 32.68, 36.09, 81.05 -> median is 32.13\n\n But the median might be too low? \n\n Since we are not given any other information, and we must provide a forecast, we will use the average for each hour.\n\n However, note that the spike on Monday might be due to a temporary condition that is not expected on Tuesday? But we don't know.\n\n Given the instructions, we will compute the simple average for each hour of the day over the last 7 days.\n\n But note: the data for 2017/1/16 (Monday) is the most recent and might be more indicative? We could use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days.\n\n Weights: let's assign weights from the most recent day (2017/1/16) to the oldest (2017/1/10) as 7,6,5,4,3,2,1.\n\n Then for hour h:\n   weighted_avg = (w1 * p1 + w2 * p2 + ... + w7 * p7) / (w1+w2+...+w7)\n   where w1 (for 2017/1/16) = 7, w2 (2017/1/15)=6, ... w7 (2017/1/10)=1.\n\n The sum of weights = 7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 28.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n   p1 (2017/1/16 0:00) = 30.90\n   p2 (2017/1/15 0:00) = 28.81\n   p3 (2017/1/14 0:00) = 29.62\n   p4 (2017/1/13 0:00)=29.01\n   p5 (2017/1/12 0:00)=23.48\n   p6 (2017/1/11 0:00)=25.35\n   p7 (2017/1/10 0:00)=26.95\n\n   weighted_avg = (7*30.90 + 6*28.81 + 5*29.62 + 4*29.01 + 3*23.48 + 2*25.35 + 1*26.95) / 28\n\n Let me compute numerator:\n   7*30.90 = 216.3\n   6*28.81 = 172.86\n   5*29.62 = 148.1\n   4*29.01 = 116.04\n   3*23.48 = 70.44\n   2*25.35 = 50.7\n   1*26.95 = 26.95\n   Sum = 216.3+172.86+148.1+116.04+70.44+50.7+26.95 = 801.39\n   weighted_avg = 801.39 / 28 = 28.621\n\n This is for hour 0.\n\n We can do the same for each hour.\n\n But note: the spike at 17:00 on Monday (81.05) will be given the highest weight (7). So the forecast for 17:00 on Tuesday would be:\n\n   p1 (2017/1/16 17:00) = 81.05\n   p2 (2017/1/15 17:00) = 32.68\n   p3 (2017/1/14 17:00) = 32.13\n   p4 (2017/1/13 17:00)=36.09\n   p5 (2017/1/12 17:00)=30.56\n   p6 (2017/1/11 17:00)=29.61\n   p7 (2017/1/10 17:00)=31.20\n\n   numerator = 7*81.05 + 6*32.68 + 5*32.13 + 4*36.09 + 3*30.56 + 2*29.61 + 1*31.20\n             = 567.35 + 196.08 + 160.65 + 144.36 + 91.68 + 59.22 + 31.20\n             = 1250.54\n   weighted_avg = 1250.54 / 28 = 44.662\n\n This is a high price, but it might be acceptable if the spike continues? But we don't know.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the spike? But the problem says we are an expert, and we must use our judgment.\n\n Considering that the spike on Monday might be an anomaly and not repeat on Tuesday, we might prefer the simple average (without weights) for robustness? \n\n After consideration, I think the weighted average is better because it gives more importance to recent days, but the spike might be an outlier.\n\n We can use a method: if the value on the most recent day (Monday) for a given hour is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean of the previous 6 days for that hour, then we treat it as an outlier and replace it with the median of the last 7 days? \n\n However, that would be complex for 24 hours and we don't have enough data for a reliable standard deviation.\n\n Given the time, we will use the weighted average for each hour, but we are aware that the spike might be an outlier and we might overestimate.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median for each hour? \n\n Let me compare:\n\n   For hour 17: \n        without Monday: the 6 days before Monday: [31.20, 29.61, 30.56, 36.09, 32.13, 32.68] -> median = sort: 29.61, 30.56, 31.20, 32.13, 32.68, 36.09 -> median = (31.20+32.13)/2 = 31.665\n        including Monday: [29.61, 30.56, 31.20, 32.13, 32.68, 36.09, 81.05] -> median = 32.13\n\n   So the median including Monday is 32.13, which is the 4th in the sorted list.\n\n   The median is robust to the outlier.\n\n   For other hours without spikes, the median and the average might be close.\n\n So I decide to use the median for each hour over the last 7 days to forecast the next day.\n\n Steps for each hour h (0 to 23) of 2017/1/17:\n\n   Collect the 7 values for hour h from the 7 days (2017/1/10 to 2017/1/16).\n   Sort them and take the middle one (the 4th in the sorted list of 7).\n\n This will be our forecast for hour h.\n\n Let's compute for hour 0:\n\n   Values: 26.95 (2017/1/10), 25.35 (2017/1/11), 23.48 (2017/1/12), 29.01 (2017/1/13), 29.62 (2017/1/14), 28.81 (2017/1/15), 30.90 (2017/1/16)\n\n   Sort: 23.48, 25.35, 26.95, 28.81, 29.01, 29.62, 30.90\n   Median = 28.81\n\n For hour 1:\n\n   Values: 26.22, 24.54, 23.18, 28.80, 28.74, 28.22, 30.70\n   Sort: 23.18, 24.54, 26.22, 28.22, 28.74, 28.80, 30.70\n   Median = 28.22\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n This method is robust to outliers and captures the central tendency.\n\n We'll compute the median for each hour and then output the 24 values.\n\n Let's do the computation:\n\n Hour 0: [26.95, 25.35, 23.48, 29.01, 29.62, 28.81, 30.90] -> sorted: 23.48, 25.35, 26.95, 28.81, 29.01, 29.62, 30.90 -> median =
