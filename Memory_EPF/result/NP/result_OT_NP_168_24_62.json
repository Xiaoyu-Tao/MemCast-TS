        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/3/11 0:00 to 2014/3/17 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/3/18 0:00 to 2014/3/18 23:00.\n\n However, note that the data provided does not have any missing values in the given period. We can observe a clear daily pattern (diurnal) and weekly pattern (weekdays vs. weekend). The prices are typically higher during the day and lower at night, and also lower on weekends.\n\n Since we are only given the historical prices and no exogenous variables (like load or wind forecasts) for the future, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n 1. We note that the data has a frequency of 24 hours (daily seasonality). Also, we might consider weekly seasonality (168 hours) but given the short history (only 7 days) and the fact that we are forecasting only one day ahead, we can use a model that captures daily patterns.\n\n 2. We can use a simple method such as:\n    - Using the average of the same hour of the previous days (e.g., average of all 0:00, 1:00, etc. from the past 7 days) to forecast the next day.\n\n 3. However, we note that the weekdays and weekends have different patterns. The last day in the data (2014/3/17) is a Monday. The next day (2014/3/18) is a Tuesday. Therefore, we can use the previous Tuesday (2014/3/11) as a reference, but also consider the recent days.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last few weekdays. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the last Tuesday (2014/3/11) and the weekdays from the same week (Monday 2014/3/17, Friday 2014/3/14, Thursday 2014/3/13, Wednesday 2014/3/12). But note that Monday 2014/3/17 is the last day and might be the most relevant.\n\n 5. Considering the short history and the need for simplicity, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the same day of last week (Tuesday). However, without knowing the exact calendar (holidays, etc.), we assume the provided dates are typical.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most recent days have higher weights. For simplicity, we use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). But note: Sunday and Saturday are weekends and have lower prices. The day we are forecasting is a weekday (Tuesday), so we might rely more on weekdays.\n\n 7. Let's check the data: \n    - The last 3 days: \n        - Monday (2014/3/17): weekday\n        - Sunday (2014/3/16): weekend\n        - Saturday (2014/3/15): weekend\n    - The same day last week: Tuesday (2014/3/11): weekday\n\n 8. Since the pattern on weekends is different, we might not want to use Saturday and Sunday for forecasting a weekday. Therefore, we can use:\n    - The same day last week (Tuesday, 2014/3/11)\n    - The last two weekdays: Monday (2014/3/17) and Friday (2014/3/14) and Thursday (2014/3/13) and Wednesday (2014/3/12). But that would be 5 days.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). That would be 4 days. But note that the last Tuesday (2014/3/11) is 7 days ago and might be less relevant.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would include weekend days which are different.\n\n 11. We can try to use a weighted average: \n     - weight for the same day (Monday) = 0.4\n     - weight for the previous weekday (Friday) = 0.3\n     - weight for the same day last week (Tuesday) = 0.3\n\n 12. However, without a model, we can also consider a naive method: use the same day last week (Tuesday 2014/3/11) as the forecast. But that might not capture recent trends.\n\n 13. We note that the prices on Monday (2014/3/17) are generally higher than the previous Tuesday (2014/3/11). So we might adjust the last Tuesday's pattern by the difference between Monday and the Monday of last week? But we don't have the Monday of last week (2014/3/10) in the data.\n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 7 days, a practical approach is to use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) with equal weights.\n\n 15. But note: the data only includes from 2014/3/11 (Tuesday) to 2014/3/17 (Monday). So we have:\n     - Tuesday (2014/3/11): day1\n     - Wednesday (2014/3/12): day2\n     - Thursday (2014/3/13): day3\n     - Friday (2014/3/14): day4\n     - Saturday (2014/3/15): day5\n     - Sunday (2014/3/16): day6\n     - Monday (2014/3/17): day7\n\n 16. For forecasting Tuesday (2014/3/18), we can use:\n     - The same hour from Tuesday (day1) and the same hour from the last three weekdays: Monday (day7), Friday (day4), Thursday (day3). So we have 4 days.\n\n 17. We compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of the same hour from these 4 days.\n\n 18. However, we can also consider that the most recent day (Monday) might be more relevant. So we can use a weighted average with weights: \n      Monday: 0.4, Friday: 0.3, Thursday: 0.2, Tuesday (last week): 0.1\n\n 19. But without a strong reason, we can use equal weights for simplicity.\n\n 20. Let's do equal weights: for each hour h, \n        forecast = (price_h of day1 + price_h of day3 + price_h of day4 + price_h of day7) / 4\n\n 21. However, we note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included because they are not weekdays and have a different pattern.\n\n 22. We'll compute the forecast for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00 for 2014/3/18.\n\n 23. Steps:\n      - Extract the 24 hours for Tuesday (2014/3/11) -> index 0 to 23\n      - Extract the 24 hours (Thursday 2014/3/13) -> index 48 to 71\n      - Extract the 24 hours (Friday 2014/3/14) -> index 72 to 95\n      - Extract the 24 hours (Monday 2014/3/17) -> index 144 to 167\n\n 24. Then for hour 0: \n        forecast_0 = (25.25 (Tue 0:00) + 25.84 (Thu 0:00) + 24.83 (Fri 0:00) + 23.80 (Mon 0:00)) / 4\n\n 25. But note: the data for Thursday 0:00 is 2014/3/13 0:00 -> 25.84? Actually, in the data:\n        Thu 0:00: 2014/3/13 0:00 -> 25.84\n        Fri 0:00: 2014/3/14 0:00 -> 24.83\n        Mon 0:00: 2014/3/17 0:00 -> 23.80\n        Tue 0:00: 2014/3/11 0:00 -> 25.25\n\n 26. Calculate:\n        hour0: (25.25 + 25.84 + 24.83 + 23.80) / 4 = (99.72) / 4 = 24.93\n\n 27. Similarly, we do for all 24.\n\n 28. However, we must check if there is a trend? The prices on Monday (2014/3/17) are generally higher than the previous days? Actually, looking at the data, the Monday prices are not consistently higher. We are using a simple average.\n\n 29. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But the data doesn't show extreme outliers.\n\n 30. We'll proceed with the simple average of these four days for each hour.\n\n 31. Let's compute:\n\n      Hour 0: (25.25 + 25.84 + 24.83 + 23.80) / 4 = 24.72 / 4? -> 99.72/4 = 24.93\n      Hour 1: (25.32 + 25.57 + 24.58 + 22.91) / 4 = (25.32+25.57=50.89; 50.89+24.58=75.47; 75.47+22.91=98.38) -> 98.38/4=24.595 -> 24.60\n      ... and so on.\n\n 32. But note: the data for Monday (2014/3/17) at 1:00 is 22.91, which is lower. This might be an outlier? But we are using average so it should be okay.\n\n 33. We must do for all 24 hours.\n\n 34. Alternatively, we can write a small program to compute, but since we are doing by hand, we do step by step.\n\n 35. We list the four days for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: Tue:25.25, Thu:25.84, Fri:24.83, Mon:23.80 -> 24.93\n      Hour 1: Tue:25.32, Thu:25.57, Fri:24.58, Mon:22.91 -> (25.32+25.57+24.58+22.91)=98.38 -> 24.595 -> 24.60\n      Hour 2: Tue:24.70, Thu:25.49, Fri:24.56, Mon:22.80 -> 24.70+25.49+24.56+22.80 = 97.55 -> 24.3875 -> 24.39\n      Hour 3: Tue:24.30, Thu:25.90, Fri:25.11, Mon:22.30 -> 24.30+25.90+25.11+22.30 = 97.61 -> 24.4025 -> 24.40\n      Hour 4: Tue:25.07, Thu:26.52, Fri:25.67, Mon:23.49 -> 25.07+26.52+25.67+23.49 = 100.75 -> 25.1875 -> 25.19\n      Hour 5: Tue:26.68, Thu:27.18, Fri:26.75, Mon:25.09 -> 26.68+27.18+26.75+25.09 = 105.70 -> 26.425 -> 26.43\n      Hour 6: Tue:27.79, Thu:27.82, Fri:27.56, Mon:25.73 -> 27.79+27.82+27.56+25.73 = 108.90 -> 27.225 -> 27.23\n      Hour 7: Tue:28.65, Thu:28.91, Fri:28.52, Mon:26.83 -> 28.65+28.91+28.52+26.83 = 112.91 -> 28.2275 -> 28.23\n      Hour 8: Tue:29.22, Thu:29.16, Fri:28.90, Mon:27.20 -> 29.22+29.16+28.90+27.20 = 114.48 -> 28.62\n      Hour 9: Tue:28.93, Thu:28.79, Fri:28.54, Mon:27.01 -> 28.93+28.79+28.54+27.01 = 113.27 -> 28.3175 -> 28.32\n      Hour10: Tue:28.37, Thu:28.44, Fri:27.98, Mon:26.86 -> 28.37+28.44+27.98+26.86 = 111.65 -> 27.9125 -> 27.91\n      Hour11: Tue:27.94, Thu:28.11, Fri:27.70, Mon:26.67 -> 27.94+28.11+27.70+26.67 = 110.42 -> 27.605 -> 27.61\n      Hour12: Tue:27.65, Thu:27.58, Fri:27.26, Mon:26.49 -> 27.65+27.58+27.26+26.49 = 108.98 -> 27.245 -> 27.25\n      Hour13: Tue:27.44, Thu:27.26, Fri:26.76, Mon:25.96 -> 27.44+27.26+26.76+25.96 = 107.42 -> 26.855 -> 26.86\n      Hour14: Tue:27.37, Thu:27.09, Fri:26.62, Mon:25.99 -> 27.37+27.09+26.62+25.99 = 107.07 -> 26.7675 -> 26.77\n      Hour15: Tue:27.48, Thu:27.01, Fri:26.41, Mon:26.33 -> 27.48+27.01+26.41+26.33 = 107.23 -> 26.8075 -> 26.81\n      Hour16: Tue:27.57, Thu:27.00, Fri:26.19, Mon:26.54 -> 27.57+27.00+26.19+26.54 = 107.30 -> 26.825 -> 26.83\n      Hour17: Tue:27.93, Thu:27.42, Fri:26.65, Mon:27.46 -> 27.93+27.42+26.65+27.46 = 109.46 -> 27.365 -> 27.37\n      Hour18: Tue:28.31, Thu:27.82, Fri:26.99, Mon:28.11 -> 28.31+27.82+26.99+28.11 = 111.23 -> 27.8075 -> 27.81\n      Hour19: Tue:28.41, Thu:27.77, Fri:26.60, Mon:28.10 -> 28.41+27.77+26.60+28.10 = 110.88 -> 27.72\n      Hour20: Tue:27.73, Thu:27.27, Fri:25.85, Mon:27.46 -> 27.73+27.27+25.85+27.46 = 108.31 -> 27.0775 -> 27.08\n      Hour21: Tue:27.43, Thu:26.93, Fri:25.27, Mon:27.04 -> 27.43+26.93+25.27+27.04 = 106.67 -> 26.6675 -> 26.67\n      Hour22: Tue:27.09, Thu:26.30, Fri:24.29, Mon:26.02 -> 27.09+26.30+24.29+26.02 = 103.70 -> 25.925 -> 25.93\n      Hour23: Tue:26.39, Thu:25.36, Fri:22.76, Mon:25.47 -> 26.39+25.36+22.76+25.47 = 99.98 -> 24.995 -> 25.00\n\n 36. Therefore, the forecast for 2014/3/18 (next 24 hours) is:\n\n        0:00: 24.93\n        1:00: 24.60\n        2:00: 24.39\n        3:00: 24.40\n        4:00: 25.19\n        5:00: 26.43\n        6:00: 27.23\n        7:00: 28.23\n        8:00: 28.62\n        9:00: 28.32\n        10:00: 27.91\n        11:00: 27.61\n        12:00: 27.25\n        13:00: 26.86\n        14:00: 26.77\n        15:00: 26.81\n        16:00: 26.83\n        17:00: 27.37\n        18:00: 27.81\n        19:00: 27.72\n        20:00: 27.08\n        21:00: 26.67\n        22:00: 25.93\n        23:00: 25.00\n\n 37. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n 38. Note: This is a simple method. In practice, more sophisticated models (like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning) would be used, but given the constraints, we use this averaging method.\n\n 39. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 40. Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n        2014/3/18 0:00 24.93\n        2014/3/18 1:00 24.60\n        ... \n        </answer>\n",
