        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (7 days * 24 hours). The task is to forecast the next 24 hours (one day ahead).\n Since the problem mentions that there might be missing values, we note that the provided data does not have any missing values in the given sample.\n\n However, as an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, I know that electricity prices exhibit:\n   - Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern): prices are higher during the day and lower at night.\n   - Weekly seasonality: weekdays vs weekends.\n\n The data provided is from 2014-09-30 00:00 to 2014-10-06 23:00 (which is 7 days: 168 hours). \n The next 24 hours would be for 2014-10-07 00:00 to 2014-10-07 23:00.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like load or wind forecasts) for the future, \n we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Given the short-term nature (24 hours ahead) and the clear daily patterns, we can use:\n   - A model that captures the daily pattern and the recent trend.\n\n Simple methods:\n   - Use the average of the same hour of the previous days (e.g., average of the last 7 days at 00:00 for forecasting 00:00 of the next day).\n   - Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern: weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices than weekends.\n\n Let's check the dates:\n   - 2014-09-30: Tuesday\n   - 2014-10-01: Wednesday\n   - 2014-10-02: Thursday\n   - 2014-10-03: Friday\n   - 2014-10-04: Saturday\n   - 2014-10-05: Sunday\n   - 2014-10-06: Monday\n\n The next day, 2014-10-07, is a Tuesday.\n\n Therefore, we can use the same hour of the previous Tuesday (2014-09-30) and the most recent Monday (2014-10-06) as references, \n but also consider the trend.\n\n However, a more robust method is to use a weighted average of the last few days for the same hour, giving more weight to the same day of the previous week and the most recent days.\n\n Proposed method:\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2014-10-07, Tuesday), we take:\n      forecast_h = (2 * price of the same hour of the previous Tuesday (2014-09-30) \n                   + 1 * price of the same hour of the previous Monday (2014-10-06) \n                   + 1 * price of the same hour of the previous day (Monday, 2014-10-06) [but note: the previous day is Monday, and we are forecasting Tuesday, so we don't have the same day of the week before?]\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   - The same hour from the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) and adjust by the trend from the last week.\n\n But note: the data from 7 days ago (2014-09-30) is a Tuesday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n However, we also have the data from the last 7 days. We can compute the average of the same hour for the last 7 days and then adjust by the difference between the same day last week and the average of the last 7 days? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple seasonal naive approach: use the same hour from the same day of the week one week ago. But that would be:\n\n   forecast for 2014-10-07 00:00 = the price of 2014-09-30 00:00 (which is 32.69)\n\n But we see that the prices have been decreasing over the week? Let's check the last Monday (2014-10-06) at 00:00: 30.73, which is lower than the previous Tuesday (32.69). \n\n We might adjust by the trend. We can compute the average change per day? \n\n However, the problem is that we are only allowed to use the given data and we must provide a forecast.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables, I propose:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) on the forecast day (Tuesday, 2014-10-07):\n        base = the same hour from the same day last week (Tuesday, 2014-09-30 at hour h)\n        trend = the average of the differences between the same hour of consecutive days in the last week? \n\n But note: we have 7 days, so we can compute the average change from one day to the next for the same hour? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the last 7 days for that hour, with weights decreasing as we go back in time.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. Since there are no missing values in the provided data, we don't have to handle any.\n\n After reviewing, I will use:\n\n   forecast_h = 0 to 23) = (4 * price_7days_ago_h + 2 * price_6days_ago_h + 1 * price_5days_ago_h + 1 * price_4days_ago_h + 1 * price_3days_ago_h + 1 * price_2days_ago_h + 2 * price_1day_ago_h) / 12\n\n But note: the days are:\n   7 days ago: 2014-09-30 (Tuesday) -> weight 4\n   6 days ago: 2014-10-01 (Wednesday) -> weight 2\n   5 days ago: 2014-10-02 (Thursday) -> weight 1\n   4 days ago: 2014-10-03 (Friday) -> weight 1\n   3 days ago: 2014-10-04 (Saturday) -> weight 1\n   2 days ago: 2014-10-05 (Sunday) -> weight 1\n   1 day ago: 2014-10-06 (Monday) -> weight 2\n\n Why these weights? Because we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we give the highest weight to the last Tuesday. Then we give more weight to the most recent day (Monday) and the day that is the same type (Wednesday, which is a weekday) and then the rest. We give less weight to the weekend.\n\n But note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices, and we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday) so we don't want to overemphasize the weekend.\n\n Alternatively, we can use only the weekdays? But the problem is that the last day is Monday (weekday) and the Tuesday of last week.\n\n Let me try a simpler method: use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (excluding the weekend) and the same day last week.\n\n The weekdays in the last 7 days: \n   Tuesday (2014-09-30), Wednesday(2014-10-01), Thursday(2014-10-02), Friday(2014-10-03), and Monday(2014-10-06). \n   We exclude Saturday and Sunday.\n\n Then for each hour h, we take the average of:\n   - same hour on Tuesday (2014-09-30)\n   - same hour on Wednesday (2014-10-01)\n   - same hour on Thursday (2014-10-02)\n   - same hour on Friday (2014-10-03)\n   - same hour on Monday (2014-10-06)\n\n But note: we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we might want to give more weight to the previous Tuesday.\n\n We can do: \n   forecast_h = (2 * price_last_tuesday_h + \n                 price_last_wednesday_h + \n                 price_last_thursday_h + \n                 price_last_friday_h + \n                 price_last_monday_h) / 6\n\n However, 2+1+1+1+1 = 6.\n\n Let's test for h=0 (00:00):\n   last Tuesday (2014-09-30 00:00): 32.69\n   last Wednesday (2014-10-01 00:00): 32.80\n   last Thursday (2014-10-02 00:00): 32.56\n   last Friday (2014-10-03 00:00): 32.17\n   last Monday (2014-10-06 00:00): 30.73\n\n   forecast_00 = (2*32.69 + 32.80 + 32.56 + 32.17 + 30.73) / 6 \n                = (65.38 + 32.80 + 32.56 + 32.17 + 30.73) / 6\n                = 193.64 / 6 = 32.2733\n\n But note: the prices have been decreasing. The last Monday (which was yesterday) is 30.73, which is lower. \n\n Another idea: use the same day last week and adjust by the trend of the last week.\n\n   trend = (price_last_monday_h - price_last_tuesday_h) / 7   [but that would be a weekly trend?]\n\n   Actually, we can compute the average daily change for the same hour over the last 7 days? \n\n   For hour h, we have 7 points: d0 (last Tuesday), d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6 (last Monday). \n   we can fit a linear trend: y = a + b * t, where t is the day index (0 to 6). Then forecast for t=7.\n\n But that might be too heavy for 24 separate regressions? \n\n Considering the time, I will go with the weighted average of the same hour for the last 7 days, with weights:\n\n   w = [4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]  for days from 7 days ago to 1 day ago.\n\n Then for each hour h, we compute:\n\n   forecast_h = (w0 * price_7d + w1 * price_6d + w2 * price_5d + w3 * price_4d + w4 * price_3d + w5 * price_2d + w6 * price_1d) / (w0+...+w6)\n\n   = (4*price_7d + 2*price_6d + price_5d + price_4d + price_3d + price_2d + 2*price_1d) / 12\n\n Let's compute for h=0 (00:00):\n\n   price_7d (2014-09-30 00:00): 32.69\n   price_6d (2014-10-01 00:00): 32.80\n   price_5d (2014-10-02 00:00): 32.56\n   price_4d (2014-10-03 00:00): 32.17\n   price_3d (2014-10-04 00:00): 31.16   # Saturday\n   price_2d (2014-10-05 00:00): 30.07   # Sunday\n   price_1d (2014-10-06 00:00): 30.73   # Monday\n\n   forecast_00 = (4*32.69 + 2*32.80 + 32.56 + 32.17 + 31.16 + 30.07 + 2*30.73) / 12\n                = (130.76 + 65.60 + 32.56 + 32.17 + 31.16 + 30.07 + 61.46) / 12\n                = 383.78 / 12 = 31.9817\n\n We round to two decimals as in the data.\n\n Let's do one more for a peak hour, say 8:00 (hour 8):\n\n   price_7d (2014-09-30 08:00): 38.68\n   price_6d (2014-10-01 08:00): 38.64\n   price_5d (2014-10-02 08:00): 38.05\n   price_4d (2014-10-03 08:00): 36.68\n   price_3d (2014-10-04 08:00): 33.05\n   price_2d (2014-10-05 08:00): 31.62\n   price_1d (2014-10-06 08:00): 34.99\n\n   forecast_08 = (4*38.68 + 2*38.64 + 38.05 + 36.68 + 33.05 + 31.62 + 2*34.99) / 12\n                = (154.72 + 77.28 + 38.05 + 36.68 + 33.05 + 31.62 + 69.98) / 12\n                = 441.38 / 12 = 36.7817\n\n This seems reasonable.\n\n Steps for each hour from 0 to 23:\n\n   Let the historical data be in a list `prices` of length 168, where the first element is 2014-09-30 00:00 and the last is 2014-10-06 23:00.\n\n   For hour h in [0,23]:\n        index_7d = h   (because the first 24 hours are 2014-09-30, which is 7 days ago)\n        index_6d = 24 + h\n        index_5d = 48 + h\n        index_4d = 72 + h\n        index_3d = 96 + h\n        index_2d = 120 + h\n        index_1d = 144 + h\n\n        p7 = prices[index_7d]\n        p6 = prices[index_6d]\n        p5 = prices[index_5d]\n        p4 = prices[index_4d]\n        p3 = prices[index_3d]\n        p2 = prices[index_2d]\n        p1 = prices[index_1d]\n\n        forecast = (4*p7 + 2*p6 + p5 + p4 + p3 + p2 + 2*p1) / 12.0\n\n   Then round to two decimal places.\n\n Let's code this in the answer.\n\n But note: the data is given in a table. We can parse the table and then compute.\n\n However, the answer must be in the format.\n\n We'll write the forecast for 2014-10-07 00:00 to 2014-10-07 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Read the historical data into a list of 168 numbers.\n\n   For h in range(0,24):\n        indices: \n          h0 = h (0-indexed in the first 24 hours: 0 to 23 -> 2014-09-30)\n          h1 = 24 + h\n          h2 = 48 + h\n          h3 = 72 + h\n          h4 = 96 + h\n          h5 = 120 + h\n          h6 = 144 + h\n\n        p0 = historical[h0]   # 7 days ago\n        p1 = historical[h1]   # 6 days ago\n        p2 = historical[h2]   # 5 days ago\n        p3 = historical[h3]   # 4 days ago\n        p4 = historical[h4]   # 3 days ago (Saturday)\n        p5 = historical[h5]   # 2 days ago (Sunday)\n        p6 = historical[h6]   # 1 day ago (Monday)\n\n        forecast = (4*p0 + 2*p1 + 1*p2 + 1*p3 + 1*p4 + 1*p5 + 2*p6) / 12.0\n\n        Round to two decimal places.\n\n   Then output the forecast for each hour.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n But note: the data is given in a table.
