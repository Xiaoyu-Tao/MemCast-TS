        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-12-23 00:00 to 2014-12-29 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014-12-30 00:00 to 2014-12-30 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset may contain missing values, but in the provided data, there are no missing values in the 'OT' column. Therefore, we can proceed without imputation for the given series.\n\nAs an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, I note that electricity prices exhibit:\n- Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)\n- Weekly seasonality (though the provided data is only 7 days, which is exactly one week, so we can capture the pattern)\n- Also, note that the data includes the Christmas period (Dec 24-26) which might have different patterns.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a forecast without additional features (like grid load or wind power), we can use a time series model that captures seasonality. Since we are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables, we must rely on univariate forecasting.\n\nA common approach is to use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. However, with only 168 points, we can also consider simpler models like exponential smoothing with seasonality (e.g., Holt-Winters) or even a seasonal naive forecast.\n\nBut note: the data shows a clear daily pattern and also some non-stationarity (e.g., the spike on 2014-12-29). We must be cautious.\n\nGiven the constraints and the fact that we are to provide a forecast for the next 24 hours, we can do the following:\n\n1. Check for stationarity and seasonality.\n2. If we use SARIMA, we need to select parameters (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q, m=24 for daily seasonality). However, with only 7 days, the weekly seasonality (m=168) is too long to model with such a short series.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a model that uses the daily pattern and the recent trend.\n\nGiven the spike on the last day (2014-12-29), which is a Monday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday (2014-12-30), we might expect a similar pattern but perhaps without the extreme spike? However, without more context (like why the spike occurred) we have to rely on the data.\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can use a naive approach: take the average of the same hour of the previous days, but giving more weight to the most recent days. Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day (which was Tuesday, 2014-12-23) but adjusted by the recent trend.\n\nBut note: the data from 2014-12-23 (Tuesday) to 2014-12-29 (Monday) is 7 days. The next day is Tuesday (2014-12-30). So we can use the previous Tuesday (2014-12-23) as a base, but adjust by the overall trend of the last week.\n\nHowever, the last day (2014-12-29) had a significant spike. We must consider if that spike is an anomaly or part of a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last 7 days, but that would smooth out the spike. We can also try to use the last day (2014-12-29) as a base and adjust by the day-of-week effect.\n\nBut without more data, it's challenging to model weekly seasonality. Therefore, I propose:\n\n- Use a combination of the last day (2014-12-29) and the same day of the previous week (2014-12-23) with a weighting.\n\nHowever, the spike on 2014-12-29 might be due to a temporary event. If we believe that the spike is temporary and will not repeat, then we might adjust downwards.\n\nBut without domain knowledge, we can only rely on the data. Let's look at the data:\n\n- The prices on 2014-12-29 (Monday) were much higher than the previous Monday (2014-12-22, which is not provided). So we don't have the same day of the week from the previous week for Monday.\n\nGiven the data we have, we have:\n\n- 7 days: Tuesday (23rd) to Monday (29th). We are forecasting Tuesday (30th).\n\nWe can compute the average hourly profile for the week and then adjust by the trend of the last day? Or we can use the following:\n\n- For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the 7 days, but then adjust by the ratio of the last day's average to the overall average? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a simple method: use the same hour from the previous day (2014-12-29) as the forecast, but that would carry over the spike.\n\nAnother idea: use the median of the same hour over the past 7 days to avoid the spike on the last day.\n\nBut note: the spike might be a real event (e.g., high demand, low wind) and might persist? We don't know.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the problem does not provide exogenous variables, I will use a robust method: the median of the same hour over the last 7 days. This will smooth out the spike on the last day, but it is a conservative approach.\n\nLet me calculate the median for each hour:\n\nFor hour 0: \n  Dec-23: 28.32, Dec-24: 29.28, Dec-25: 29.33, Dec-26: 30.00, Dec-27: 29.99, Dec-28: 30.33, Dec-29: 31.31\n  -> sorted: 28.32, 29.28, 29.33, 29.99, 30.00, 30.33, 31.31 -> median = 29.99\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\nBut note: the median might not capture the recent upward trend. Alternatively, we can use the median of the last 3 days? \n\nHowever, the problem says to handle missing values, but there are none. So we can proceed.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, I choose to use the median of the same hour over the last 7 days. This is a simple and robust method.\n\nLet's compute the median for each hour (0 to 23) from the 7 days:\n\nHour 0: [28.32, 29.28, 29.33, 30.00, 29.99, 30.33, 31.31] -> sorted: 28.32, 29.28, 29.33, 29.99, 30.00, 30.33, 31.31 -> median = 29.99\nHour 1: [27.64, 28.81, 28.92, 29.69, 29.25, 29.84, 30.18] -> sorted: 27.64, 28.81, 28.92, 29.25, 29.69, 29.84, 30.18 -> median = 29.25\nHour 2: [26.77, 28.48, 28.41, 29.51, 29.10, 29.64, 29.99] -> sorted: 26.77, 28.41, 28.48, 29.10, 29.51, 29.64, 29.99 -> median = 29.10\nHour 3: [26.27, 28.13, 28.34, 29.51, 29.11, 29.62, 29.98] -> sorted: 26.27, 28.13, 28.34, 29.11, 29.51, 29.62, 29.98 -> median = 29.11\nHour 4: [26.43, 28.13, 28.41, 29.54, 29.20, 29.69, 30.25] -> sorted: 26.43, 28.13, 28.41, 29.20, 29.54, 29.69, 30.25 -> median = 29.20\nHour 5: [28.33, 28.70, 28.91, 29.73, 29.43, 29.93, 31.04] -> sorted: 28.33, 28.70, 28.91, 29.43, 29.73, 29.93, 31.04 -> median = 29.43\nHour 6: [29.27, 29.21, 29.16, 29.95, 29.81, 30.02, 34.73] -> sorted: 29.16, 29.21, 29.27, 29.81, 29.95, 30.02, 34.73 -> median = 29.81\nHour 7: [30.10, 29.55, 29.37, 30.19, 30.11, 30.20, 39.94] -> sorted: 29.37, 29.55, 30.10, 30.11, 30.19, 30.20, 39.94 -> median = 30.11\nHour 8: [30.32, 29.87, 29.62, 30.26, 30.87, 30.65, 46.74] -> sorted: 29.62, 29.87, 30.26, 30.32, 30.65, 30.87, 46.74 -> median = 30.32\nHour 9: [30.34, 30.07, 29.91, 31.25, 31.50, 30.94, 49.79] -> sorted: 29.91, 30.07, 30.34, 30.94, 31.25, 31.50, 49.79 -> median = 30.94\nHour 10: [30.25, 30.07, 29.97, 31.68, 31.63, 33.23, 44.73] -> sorted: 29.97, 30.07, 30.25, 31.63, 31.68, 33.23, 44.73 -> median = 31.63\nHour 11: [30.11, 29.99, 30.11, 31.78, 32.53, 35.79, 44.17] -> sorted: 29.99, 30.11, 30.11, 31.78, 32.53, 35.79, 44.17 -> median = 31.78\nHour 12: [30.05, 29.84, 30.00, 31.49, 33.42, 35.47, 44.32] -> sorted: 29.84, 30.00, 30.05, 31.49, 33.42, 35.47, 44.32 -> median = 31.49\nHour 13: [30.12, 29.82, 30.10, 31.43, 32.57, 34.21, 44.04] -> sorted: 29.82, 30.10, 30.12, 31.43, 32.57, 34.21, 44.04 -> median = 31.43\nHour 14: [30.28, 29.97, 30.44, 31.83, 31.94, 33.53, 55.50] -> sorted: 29.97, 30.28, 30.44, 31.83, 31.94, 33.53, 55.50 -> median = 31.83\nHour 15: [30.43, 30.14, 30.88, 32.19, 31.99, 33.85, 67.59] -> sorted: 30.14, 30.43, 30.88, 31.99, 32.19, 33.85, 67.59 -> median = 31.99\nHour 16: [30.59, 30.34, 31.21, 33.42, 33.32, 36.82, 67.83] -> sorted: 30.34, 30.59, 31.21, 33.32, 33.42, 36.82, 67.83 -> median = 33.32\nHour 17: [31.40, 30.05, 31.38, 33.40, 34.84, 39.92, 67.56] -> sorted: 30.05, 31.38, 31.40, 33.40, 34.84, 39.92, 67.56 -> median = 33.40\nHour 18: [31.39, 29.76, 31.34, 33.14, 37.17, 38.07, 60.18] -> sorted: 29.76, 31.34, 31.39, 33.14, 37.17, 38.07, 60.18 -> median = 33.14\nHour 19: [30.81, 29.39, 30.99, 31.99, 33.80, 35.39, 47.49] -> sorted: 29.39, 30.81, 30.99, 31.99, 33.80, 35.39, 47.49 -> median = 31.99\nHour 20: [30.21, 29.29, 30.54, 31.45, 31.50, 34.72, 35.22] -> sorted: 29.29, 30.21, 30.54, 31.45, 31.50, 34.72, 35.22 -> median = 31.45\nHour 21: [29.88, 29.29, 30.34, 31.35, 31.35, 34.50, 33.98] -> sorted: 29.29, 29.88, 30.34, 31.35, 31.35, 33.98, 34.50 -> median = 31.35\nHour 22: [29.66, 29.34, 30.44, 30.81, 30.89, 32.87, 32.26] -> sorted: 29.34, 29.66, 30.44, 30.81, 30.89, 32.26, 32.87 -> median = 30.81\nHour 23: [28.84, 29.17, 29.99, 30.30, 30.19, 31.42, 30.99] -> sorted: 28.84, 29.17, 29.99, 30.19, 30.30, 30.99, 31.42 -> median = 30.19\n\nSo the forecast for 2014-12-30 (Tuesday) would be:\n\n00:00: 29.99\n01:00: 29.25\n02:00: 29.10\n03:00: 29.11\n04:00: 29.20\n05:00: 29.43\n06:00: 29.81\n07:00: 30.11\n08:00: 30.32\n09:00: 30.94\n10:00: 31.63\n11:00: 31.78\n12:00: 31.49\n13:00: 31.43\n14:00: 31.83\n15:00: 31.99\n16:00: 33.32\n17:00: 33.40\n18:00: 33.14\n19:00: 31.99\n20:00: 31.45\n21:00: 31.35\n22:00: 30.81\n23:00: 30.19\n\nBut note: the median method might be too conservative and not capture the recent upward trend. However, without more data, it is a robust choice.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the average of the last 3 days for each hour? That might capture the recent trend better.\n\nLet me try for a few hours:\n\nFor hour 0: last 3 days: 30.33 (28th), 30.19 (27th), 31.31 (29th) -> average = (30.33+30.19+31.31)/3 = 30.61\nBut the previous Tuesday (23rd) was 28.32, which is much lower. So the 3-day average might be more reactive.\n\nBut the spike on the 29th might be an anomaly. The median is robust to such spikes.\n\nGiven the trade-off, I stick with the median over 7 days to be safe.\n\nTherefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014-12-30 00:00 to 2014-12-30 23:00) is as above.\n\nWe output the forecast in the required format.\n\nNote: The dates in the historical data are given in the format \"YYYY/MM/DD H:MM\", so for the forecast we use the next day: 2014/12/30.\n\nLet's write the forecast:\n",
