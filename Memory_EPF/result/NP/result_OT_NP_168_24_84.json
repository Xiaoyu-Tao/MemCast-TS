        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/8/12 0:00 to 2014/8/18 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/8/19 0:00 to 2014/8/19 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power) in the provided data, we must rely on a time series forecasting method.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours). There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily and weekly seasonality. The data provided is exactly one week (7 days). We can use a model that captures the daily pattern.\n\n 3. Given the requirement for a short-term forecast (24 hours) and the availability of only 168 points, we can use a simple but effective method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous week (i.e., 168 hours ago) as the forecast for the next day.\n    - However, we note that the data shows a weekly pattern but also some non-seasonal changes. We might also consider a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n 4. But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values (though there are none in the given data). We are also to provide a complete forecast.\n\n 5. Considering the daily cycle, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But we only have 7 days. Alternatively, we can use the last week (i.e., the same day of the week and same hour) as a starting point and adjust by the recent trend.\n\n 6. However, a more sophisticated approach would be to use a time series model. Since we are to provide a forecast without any external libraries and in a short time, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n 7. But note: the data from the last week (2014/8/12 to 2014/8/18) includes weekdays and weekends. The last day (2014/8/18) is a Monday? (We don't have the day of week, but we can assume the pattern). Actually, 2014/8/12 was a Tuesday, so 2014/8/18 was a Monday. The next day (2014/8/19) would be a Tuesday.\n\n 8. We can compute the forecast for each hour of 2014/8/19 by taking the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2014/8/12) in the data. Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the Monday before that? That might be too complex.\n\n 9. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only one week of data, we can use the Seasonal Naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours? But that would ignore the weekly pattern.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This would capture the weekly seasonality.\n\n    Let H_i be the hour of the day (0 to 23). Then for each H_i in [0,23]:\n        Forecast for 2014/8/19 H_i = average of the price at H_i for the days 2014/8/12, 2014/8/13, ..., 2014/8/18.\n\n 11. However, note that the week includes both weekdays and weekend (16th and 17th are Saturday and Sunday). The 19th is a Tuesday, so we might want to use only the previous Tuesday (2014/8/12) and adjust by the overall trend? But we don't have a long history.\n\n 12. Another idea: use the same hour from the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) and then adjust by the average change from the last 7 days to the last 1 day? \n\n 13. Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This is simple and can capture the weekly pattern.\n\n 14. Let's calculate for each hour:\n\n    For hour 0:00: \n        Days: 2014/8/12 0:00 -> 29.13, 2014/8/13 0:00 -> 29.42, 2014/8/14 0:00 -> 30.27, 2014/8/15 0:00 -> 30.28, 2014/8/16 0:00 -> 30.14, 2014/8/17 0:00 -> 30.31, 2014/8/18 0:00 -> 29.63\n        Average = (29.13+29.42+30.27+30.28+30.14+30.31+29.63)/7 = 29.88\n\n    Similarly for other hours.\n\n 15. But note: the data for the same hour on different days of the week might have different patterns. For example, weekdays vs weekends. The 19th is a Tuesday, so we might get a better forecast by using the same day of the week. However, we only have one Tuesday (2014/8/12) in the history. Using only one point might be too volatile.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week for the past weeks, but we only have one week. So we cannot do that.\n\n 17. Therefore, we use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n 18. We compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n 19. However, we must note that the last day (2014/8/18) is a Monday and the next day is Tuesday. The Monday data might be more similar to the Tuesday than the weekend? But without more data, we stick to the 7-day average.\n\n 20. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n    Hour 0: (29.13 + 29.42 + 30.27 + 30.28 + 30.14 + 30.31 + 29.63) / 7 = 29.88\n    Hour 1: (27.40 + 28.62 + 29.46 + 30.01 + 29.77 + 29.55 + 28.38) / 7 = 29.03\n    Hour 2: (26.39 + 28.06 + 28.89 + 29.78 + 29.36 + 27.03 + 27.92) / 7 = 28.20\n    Hour 3: (26.03 + 28.00 + 28.78 + 29.73 + 29.11 + 26.37 + 28.02) / 7 = 28.15\n    Hour 4: (26.81 + 28.29 + 28.81 + 29.95 + 28.96 + 25.99 + 28.26) / 7 = 28.30\n    Hour 5: (28.85 + 29.50 + 30.15 + 30.41 + 28.78 + 26.36 + 30.03) / 7 = 29.15\n    Hour 6: (31.91 + 32.13 + 32.23 + 32.00 + 29.25 + 28.43 + 31.78) / 7 = 31.10\n    Hour 7: (33.84 + 33.21 + 33.70 + 33.83 + 30.24 + 28.79 + 34.53) / 7 = 32.59\n    Hour 8: (34.24 + 34.70 + 34.98 + 35.36 + 30.82 + 30.11 + 36.14) / 7 = 33.76\n    Hour 9: (34.05 + 34.94 + 34.94 + 35.87 + 31.50 + 30.31 + 35.23) / 7 = 33.83\n    Hour 10: (33.95 + 35.41 + 34.88 + 36.53 + 31.57 + 30.67 + 35.53) / 7 = 34.08\n    Hour 11: (33.92 + 36.02 + 34.99 + 36.58 + 31.33 + 30.93 + 35.44) / 7 = 34.17\n    Hour 12: (33.44 + 34.57 + 34.51 + 35.50 + 31.18 + 30.83 + 35.10) / 7 = 33.59\n    Hour 13: (32.78 + 34.68 + 33.90 + 34.74 + 31.07 + 30.67 + 34.94) / 7 = 33.25\n    Hour 14: (32.28 + 34.11 + 33.61 + 33.98 + 30.72 + 30.52 + 34.61) / 7 = 32.83\n    Hour 15: (31.98 + 33.91 + 33.49 + 33.31 + 30.73 + 30.46 + 34.16) / 7 = 32.58\n    Hour 16: (32.19 + 33.83 + 33.45 + 32.95 + 30.75 + 30.56 + 33.87) / 7 = 32.51\n    Hour 17: (33.17 + 34.64 + 33.48 + 33.11 + 31.04 + 30.74 + 33.82) / 7 = 32.86\n    Hour 18: (33.43 + 34.60 + 33.77 + 32.69 + 31.61 + 30.90 + 33.19) / 7 = 33.03\n    Hour 19: (33.75 + 33.97 + 34.29 + 33.46 + 31.43 + 30.92 + 32.81) / 7 = 33.09\n    Hour 20: (33.70 + 33.55 + 34.11 + 33.35 + 31.61 + 31.01 + 33.27) / 7 = 33.08\n    Hour 21: (33.69 + 33.74 + 34.65 + 33.20 + 32.21 + 31.04 + 33.14) / 7 = 33.10\n    Hour 22: (32.35 + 32.29 + 33.50 + 31.44 + 31.17 + 30.75 + 31.59) / 7 = 31.87\n    Hour 23: (30.45 + 30.55 + 31.27 + 30.88 + 30.39 + 30.29 + 30.22) / 7 = 30.58\n\n 21. Therefore, the forecast for 2014/8/19 from 0:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n        0:00  29.88\n        1:00  29.03\n        2:00  28.20\n        3:00  28.15\n        4:00  28.30\n        5:00  29.15\n        6:00  31.10\n        7:00  32.59\n        8:00  33.76\n        9:00  33.83\n        10:00 34.08\n        11:00 34.17\n        12:00 33.59\n        13:00 33.25\n        14:00 32.83\n        15:00 32.58\n        16:00 32.51\n        17:00 32.86\n        18:00 33.03\n        19:00 33.09\n        20:00 33.08\n        21:00 33.10\n        22:00 31.87\n        23:00 30.58\n\n 22. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple average method. In practice, more sophisticated models (like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning) might be used, but given the constraints and the data provided, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required XML-like format.\n",
