        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity prices (from 2016/3/15 0:00 to 2016/3/21 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016/3/22 0:00 to 2016/3/22 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend: The data doesn't show a strong trend over the week, but we can consider a local trend.\n   - Seasonality: Strong daily seasonality (24 periods).\n\n Models to consider: \n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24).\n   - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n However, note that we are only given 7 days of data (168 points). This is a bit short for fitting a SARIMA model with multiple parameters.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simpler approach:\n   - Calculate the average daily pattern from the past 7 days and adjust for the level of the last day.\n\n Steps for a simple method:\n   a. Extract the daily profiles (each day from day1 to day7, each having 24 hours).\n   b. We note that the last day (2016/3/21) is a Monday? (But we don't have the day of week). However, the data starts on 2016/3/15 (Tuesday) and ends on 2016/3/21 (Monday). So we have 7 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.\n\n   c. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the available 7 days. However, note that weekends (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns. So we might want to use:\n        - For forecasting a Tuesday (2016/3/22), we can use the previous Tuesday (2016/3/15) and the same day of the week from the week before? But we only have one week of data.\n\n   d. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days, but that would include weekends. Since the next day (2016/3/22) is a Tuesday, we can take the average of the two Tuesdays we have? But we only have one Tuesday (2016/3/15) in the data.\n\n   e. Another idea: use the last day (Monday, 2016/3/21) and adjust by the difference between the previous Monday and the previous Tuesday? But we don't have a Monday from the week before.\n\n Given the data limitations, we can do:\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This will smooth out the daily pattern and might be robust.\n\n   Option 2: Use the same day of the week (Tuesday) from the previous week (2016/3/15) and adjust by the overall level change from the entire week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   Option 3: Use a weighted average where more recent days are given more weight.\n\n Considering the above, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which includes Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). But without more data, we might just use the average of the same hour over the available 7 days.\n\n However, note that the data shows a slight decrease in prices over the weekend and then a slight increase on Monday. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday in the data (2016/3/15) and the most recent days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) we can do:\n\n   forecast_hour(h) = (w1 * price_7_days_ago(h) + w2 * price_6_days_ago(h) + ... + w7 * price_1_day_ago(h)) / (w1+...+w7)\n\n We can set weights: \n   - For the same day of the week (Tuesday, 7 days ago): weight 0.5\n   - For the most recent day (Monday, 1 day ago): weight 0.2\n   - For the day before that (Sunday, 2 days ago): weight 0.1\n   - For the day before that (Saturday, 3 days ago): weight 0.1\n   - For the rest (Friday, Thursday, Wednesday): weight 0.05 each.\n\n But this is arbitrary.\n\n Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing for the daily profile.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only asked for 24 hours, we can see that the daily pattern is relatively stable.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour over the 7 days:\n\n   For hour 0: (20.44 + 20.58 + 20.41 + 20.17 + 21.30 + 20.15 + 20.29) / 7\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the last week had a weekend (Saturday and Sunday) which had lower prices, and the next day is a Tuesday. The previous Tuesday (2016/3/15) had higher prices than the weekend. So the average might be pulled down by the weekend.\n\n We can also try to use only the weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday and one Monday, etc.\n\n Another idea: use the last day (Monday) and adjust by the typical Tuesday-Monday difference from the previous week? \n\n   Let D = (Tuesday_2016-03-15 - Monday_2016-03-14) but we don't have 2016-03-14.\n\n We don't have data before 2016-03-15.\n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour over the entire 7 days. This is a simple and common approach.\n\n Steps:\n   - Group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23).\n   - For each hour, compute the mean of the 7 values.\n\n However, we note that the level of the last day (Monday) is about 20.29 to 22.70, and the previous Tuesday was 20.44 to 24.64. The average might be around 21.5 to 23? \n\n Let me compute the overall average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (20.44 + 20.58 + 20.41 + 20.17 + 21.30 + 20.15 + 20.29) / 7 = (142.34) / 7 = 20.334\n   Hour 1: (20.21+20.29+20.07+19.61+21.16+19.66+19.90)/7 = (140.9)/7 = 20.129\n   ... \n\n But we see that the last day (Monday) at hour0 was 20.29, and the average is 20.33. This is close. However, the previous Tuesday at hour0 was 20.44, which is higher. \n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was higher, we might want to adjust the average upwards? But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three weekdays? (Friday, Monday, and the previous Tuesday). But we don't know if Friday was a weekday? Actually, we have:\n\n   Day1: Tuesday (2016-03-15)\n   Day2: Wednesday (2016-03-16)\n   Day3: Thursday (2016-03-17)\n   Day4: Friday (2016-03-18)\n   Day5: Saturday (2016-03-19)\n   Day6: Sunday (2016-03-20)\n   Day7: Monday (2016-03-21)\n\n So weekdays: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday (5 days) and weekends: Saturday, Sunday (2 days).\n\n We can compute the average for each hour over the 5 weekdays and use that for the Tuesday forecast? Because Tuesday is a weekday.\n\n Let me do:\n\n   Hour0: (20.44 (Tue) + 20.58 (Wed) + 20.41 (Thu) + 20.17 (Fri) + 20.29 (Mon)) / 5 = 101.89 / 5 = 20.378\n\n   Hour1: (20.21+20.29+20.07+19.61+19.90)/5 = 100.08/5 = 20.016\n\n   ... \n\n This might be better because we are excluding the weekend.\n\n But note: the Monday we have is the day before the forecast day, and it is a weekday. So including Monday is good.\n\n However, we are missing a Tuesday from the current week? We have only one Tuesday (the oldest day). \n\n We can do: \n   - Use the average of the same hour for the weekdays, but give more weight to the most recent days? \n\n   For example, weights for the weekdays: \n        Monday (most recent): weight 3\n        Friday: weight 2\n        Thursday: weight 1\n        Wednesday: weight 1\n        Tuesday: weight 1\n\n   Then for hour0: (20.29*3 + 20.17*2 + 20.41*1 + 20.58*1 + 20.44*1) / (3+2+1+1+1) = (60.87 + 40.34 + 20.41 + 20.58 + 20.44) / 8 = 162.64 / 8 = 20.33\n\n   This is similar to the simple average of weekdays.\n\n Given the time, I will use the simple average of the 5 weekdays for each hour.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) using the 5 weekdays:\n\n   Weekdays: \n        Tuesday: 2016-03-15\n        Wednesday: 2016-03-16\n        Thursday: 2016-03-17\n        Friday: 2016-03-18\n        Monday: 2016-03-21   (note: we skip Saturday and Sunday)\n\n   We have to be cautious: the Monday is the day after Sunday and before Tuesday? Yes, so it's the most recent.\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and take the average of the 5 weekdays.\n\n   Hour 0: [20.44, 20.58, 20.41, 20.17, 20.29] -> average = 20.378\n   Hour 1: [20.21, 20.29, 20.07, 19.61, 19.90] -> average = 20.016\n   Hour 2: [20.23, 20.21, 20.12, 19.62, 19.81] -> average = 20.0\n   Hour 3: [20.19, 20.07, 20.30, 19.73, 19.95] -> average = 20.048\n   Hour 4: [20.67, 20.33, 20.91, 20.11, 20.65] -> average = 20.534\n   Hour 5: [21.71, 21.32, 21.73, 21.43, 21.83] -> average = 21.604\n   Hour 6: [22.35, 22.16, 22.22, 22.15, 22.09] -> average = 22.194\n   Hour 7: [23.91, 23.27, 23.26, 22.85, 22.47] -> average = 23.152\n   Hour 8: [24.64, 23.96, 23.73, 23.62, 22.81] -> average = 23.752\n   Hour 9: [24.10, 23.27, 23.63, 23.03, 22.55] -> average = 23.316\n   Hour10: [24.02, 22.44, 22.62, 22.48, 22.44] -> average = 22.8\n   Hour11: [23.30, 22.40, 22.47, 22.43, 22.29] -> average = 22.578\n   Hour12: [22.92, 22.09, 22.22, 22.22, 22.13] -> average = 22.316\n   Hour13: [22.60, 21.79, 22.04, 22.03, 22.04] -> average = 22.1\n   Hour14: [22.41, 21.79, 22.01, 21.99, 21.90] -> average = 22.02\n   Hour15: [22.22, 21.72, 21.89, 22.01, 21.89] -> average = 21.946\n   Hour16: [22.15, 21.90, 22.03, 22.07, 21.91] -> average = 22.012\n   Hour17: [22.48, 22.16, 22.27, 22.53, 22.21] -> average = 22.33\n   Hour18: [23.18, 22.63, 22.67, 23.61, 22.70] -> average = 22.958\n   Hour19: [22.90, 22.39, 22.49, 22.97, 22.48] -> average = 22.646\n   Hour20: [22.41, 22.08, 22.14, 22.38, 22.13] -> average = 22.228\n   Hour21: [22.08, 21.79, 21.94, 22.12, 21.93] -> average = 21.972\n   Hour22: [21.66, 21.16, 21.39, 21.72, 21.65] -> average = 21.516\n   Hour23: [20.84, 20.47, 20.81, 21.11, 20.90] -> average = 20.826\n\n So the forecast for 2016/3/22 (Tuesday) would be:\n\n   0:00: 20.378\n   1:00: 20.016\n   2:00: 20.0\n   3:00: 20.048\n   4:00: 20.534\n   5:00: 21.604\n   6:00: 22.194\n   7:00: 23.152\n   8:00: 23.752\n   9:00: 23.316\n   10:00: 22.8\n   11:00: 22.578\n   12:00: 22.316\n   13:00: 22.1\n   14:00: 22.02\n   15:00: 21.946\n   16:00: 22.012\n   17:00: 22.33\n   18:00: 22.958\n   19:00: 22.646\n   20:00: 22.228\n   21:00: 21.972\n   22:00: 21.516\n   23:00: 20.826\n\n But note: the last day (Monday) had a peak at hour18 of 22.70, and the previous Tuesday had 23.18. Our forecast for hour18 is 22.958, which is between.\n\n This seems reasonable.\n\n However, we must consider that the level of the time series on the last day (Monday) was a bit lower than the previous Tuesday. But without more data, we stick to this.\n\n Let's output the forecast for the next 24 hours (2016/3/22 0:00 to 2016/3/22 23:00) with the above values.\n\n Format:\n\n   2016/3/22 0:00 20.378\n   2016/3/22 1:00 20.016\n   ... \n\n We'll round to 2 decimal places as in the input.\n\n But note: the input had 2 decimal places, so we output 2 decimal places.\n\n However, the computed averages might have more, so we round.\n\n Let me recalc with rounding to 2 decimal places for each hour:\n\n   Hour0: 20.378 -> 20.38\n   Hour1: 20.016 -> 20.02\n   Hour2: 20.0 -> 20.00\n   Actually, 20.0 is 20.00?
