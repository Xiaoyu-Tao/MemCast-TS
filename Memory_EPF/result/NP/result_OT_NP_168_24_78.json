        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/7/1 0:00 to 2014/7/7 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/7/8 0:00 to 2014/7/8 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical price.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours = 168). There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily and weekly seasonality. The data covers exactly one week (from Tuesday to Monday). The next 24 hours would be Tuesday (2014/7/8).\n\n 3. Given the requirement for a short-term forecast (24 hours ahead) and the availability of only the target variable, we can use a simple seasonal naive method or a more sophisticated model. However, without additional features, we must use a univariate method.\n\n 4. Considering the data shows a clear daily pattern (prices lower at night, higher during the day), we can use a seasonal naive approach that uses the same hour from the previous day or the same day of the previous week.\n\n    Since we have exactly one week of data, and the next day is Tuesday (the same day of the week as the first day in the data, which was Tuesday 2014/7/1), we can use the values from the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014/7/1) as a forecast.\n\n    However, note that the last day in the data is Monday (2014/7/7). The next day is Tuesday (2014/7/8). We have data for Tuesday (2014/7/1) exactly one week before.\n\n 5. Therefore, we can forecast the next 24 hours (2014/7/8) by taking the values from 2014/7/1 (the first day in the provided data).\n\n    But note: the data for 2014/7/1 is:\n        0:00 26.69\n        1:00 25.49\n        2:00 25.11\n        3:00 25.14\n        4:00 25.20\n        5:00 25.86\n        6:00 29.84\n        7:00 33.20\n        8:00 33.77\n        9:00 33.72\n        10:00 33.88\n        11:00 33.81\n        12:00 33.66\n        13:00 32.96\n        14:00 32.59\n        15:00 31.85\n        16:00 31.90\n        17:00 32.24\n        18:00 32.66\n        19:00 31.84\n        20:00 31.06\n        21:00 30.90\n        22:00 30.26\n        23:00 28.36\n\n 6. However, we must consider that the most recent week might have shown a slight downward trend? But without more data (like multiple weeks) and without exogenous variables, the simplest approach is to use the same day of the previous week.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we could use the average of the same hour over the past week? But note: we only have one week of data. The same hour over the past week would be only one point (from the previous Tuesday). So that doesn't help.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But we have 7 days. However, the pattern might change from week to week. Since we are only one week of data, we cannot average over multiple weeks.\n\n 9. Therefore, the most straightforward method is to use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014/7/1) for the forecast of 2014/7/8.\n\n 10. But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. There are none in the provided data, so we don't have to do anything for that.\n\n 11. We output the forecast for the next 24 hours (from 2014/7/8 0:00 to 2014/7/8 23:00) as the values from 2014/7/1 (the first day) but with the date adjusted.\n\n However, let's reconsider: the data from 2014/7/1 (Tuesday) to 2014/7/7 (Monday) and we are forecasting the next Tuesday. The pattern of a Tuesday might be similar to the previous Tuesday? This is a common approach in time series with weekly seasonality.\n\n But note: the data shows that the prices on the last day (Monday, 2014/7/7) are lower than the previous Monday? Actually, we don't have the previous Monday. The first day is Tuesday and the last day is Monday. So we have one Tuesday and one Monday, etc.\n\n Since we don't have multiple weeks, we cannot compute a more robust seasonal component. Therefore, using the same day of the previous week (i.e., the first day) is a reasonable baseline.\n\n However, we note that the overall level of prices in the last few days (especially the weekend) was lower. So we might adjust the forecast by the recent trend? But without a clear model, we stick to the simple method.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would be:\n\n   For hour 0:00: average of 2014/7/1 0:00, 2014/7/2 0:00, ... 2014/7/7 0:00.\n\n But note: the days of the week are different. The hour 0:00 on Tuesday (2014/7/1) and hour 0:00 on Wednesday (2014/7/2) might be different. However, if we assume that the weekly pattern is strong and we don't have enough data to break down by day of week, we can do that.\n\n But we have exactly 7 days? Then we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 7 days? However, the data we have is:\n\n   Day 1: Tuesday\n   Day 2: Wednesday\n   Day 3: Thursday\n   Day 4: Friday\n   Day 5: Saturday\n   Day 6: Sunday\n   Day 7: Monday\n\n And we are forecasting a Tuesday. The average of the same hour over the past 7 days would include one Tuesday, one Wednesday, ... one Monday. This might not be as representative for a Tuesday as the previous Tuesday.\n\n Given the trade-off, and since we are only asked for a short-term forecast and we are an expert, we might choose the previous Tuesday because it is the same day of the week.\n\n However, let's look at the data: the first Tuesday (2014/7/1) had higher prices during the day (e.g., peak at 33.88) than the following days. The last day (Monday) had peaks around 30.20. So the level has decreased.\n\n We might adjust the previous Tuesday's values by the overall change in level. One way is to compute the ratio of the average of the last 7 days to the average of the first 7 days? But note: we only have 7 days total. The first 7 days are the entire week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a multiplicative seasonal adjustment? But that might be too complex.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n   Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (2014/7/1) without adjustment.\n\n   Option 2: Scale the previous Tuesday by the ratio of the average of the last day (Monday) to the average of the first Monday? But we don't have the first Monday.\n\n   We don't have a Monday in the first week? Our data starts on Tuesday and ends on Monday. So we have one Monday (the last day) and one Tuesday (the first day). \n\n   We can compute the average of the entire week we have and compare it to the average of the previous week? But we don't have the previous week.\n\n 12. Given the lack of data beyond one week, we stick to the naive seasonal method: use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014/7/1) for 2014/7/8.\n\n 13. Therefore, the forecast for 2014/7/8 0:00 is 26.69, 1:00 is 25.49, ... 23:00 is 28.36.\n\n 14. However, we must note that the problem says we are an expert and we might use a more sophisticated model. But without additional data (like multiple weeks or exogenous variables) and without the ability to run complex models (like ARIMA or LSTM) in this environment, we use this simple method.\n\n 15. We output the forecast for the next 24 hours in the required format.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the dataset comes from the Nord Pool electricity market and contains hourly records of grid load forecasts, wind power forecasts, and observed electricity prices\". However, we are only given the observed electricity prices. So we cannot use the other features even if we wanted to.\n\n Therefore, we proceed with the seasonal naive forecast using the same day of the previous week.\n\n Forecast for 2014/7/8:\n\n 0:00: 26.69\n 1:00: 25.49\n 2:00: 25.11\n 3:00: 25.14\n 4:00: 25.20\n 5:00: 25.86\n 6:00: 29.84\n 7:00: 33.20\n 8:00: 33.77\n 9:00: 33.72\n10:00: 33.88\n11:00: 33.81\n12:00: 33.66\n13:00: 32.96\n14:00: 32.59\n15:00: 31.85\n16:00: 31.90\n17:00: 32.24\n18:00: 32.66\n19:00: 31.84\n20:00: 31.06\n21:00: 30.90\n22:00: 30.26\n23:00: 28.36\n\n We output these values with the corresponding dates and times for 2014/7/8.\n\n However, note: the historical data ends at 2014/7/7 23:00. The next hour is 2014/7/8 0:00.\n\n Format: We must output exactly 24 lines with the date in the same format: \"YYYY/M/D H:MM\", but note the historical data uses one-digit month and day? Actually, the data uses \"2014/7/1\" for July 1. So for July 8, it's \"2014/7/8\".\n\n We write:\n\n 2014/7/8 0:00 [value]\n 2014/7/8 1:00 [value]\n ...\n\n Let's write the answer in the required XML-like format.\n",
