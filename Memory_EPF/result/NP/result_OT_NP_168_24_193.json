        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/9/13 0:00 to 2016/9/19 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2016/9/20 0:00 to 2016/9/20 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have to handle missing values (though in the provided data there are no missing values in the OT column), we can proceed with the forecasting.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only given the observed electricity prices (OT). Therefore, we must base our forecast solely on the historical price data.\n\n Given the requirement for a 24-hour forecast and the nature of electricity prices (which exhibit daily and weekly seasonality), we can use a time series model that captures these patterns.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: In the provided data, there are no missing values in the OT column. So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We note that the data has:\n    - Daily seasonality: prices tend to be lower at night and higher during the day.\n    - Weekly pattern: weekdays vs weekends.\n\n 3. Since we are only given 7 days (168 hours) of data, we can use a simple model that uses the average of the same hour in the previous days, or we can use a more sophisticated approach like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or even a simple neural network. However, without additional features and with only 168 points, we might opt for a simpler method.\n\n 4. Considering the short history, we can use a seasonal naive method or an average of the last few days for the same hour. But note that the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a reasonable method.\n\n 5. We note that the last day in the data (2016/9/19) is a Monday. The next day (2016/9/20) will be a Tuesday. We can look at the previous Tuesday (2016/9/13) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n 6. However, a more robust approach is to use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days (if available) or the last few weekdays. But note that the pattern on weekends is different.\n\n 7. Since we have exactly one week of data, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday, September 13) as a base, but adjust for the overall level of the last day (Monday, September 19) compared to the previous Monday (September 12, which we don't have). Alternatively, we can use the last 7 days and compute the average for each hour.\n\n 8. Another idea: use a moving window of the last 3 weekdays for the same hour to forecast the next weekday. But note that 2016/9/19 is Monday, and 2016/9/20 is Tuesday. We have:\n     - Previous Monday: we don't have (only 7 days, so the first day is Tuesday 2016/9/13)\n     - We have: \n          Tuesday (2016/9/13), \n          Wednesday (2016/9/14), \n          Thursday (2016/9/15), \n          Friday (2016/9/16), \n          Saturday (2016/9/17), \n          Sunday (2016/9/18), \n          Monday (2016/9/19)\n\n 9. For forecasting a weekday (Tuesday), we can use the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2016/9/13) and the weekdays that are similar (like Wednesday and Thursday of the same week). But note that Friday might be different and weekends are different.\n\n10. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most recent days have higher weights. However, without more data, we can do:\n\n    Let H be the hour (0 to 23) for the forecast day (Tuesday, 2016/9/20).\n\n    We can compute:\n        forecast(H) = (w1 * price(H, Tue_prev) + w2 * price(H, Mon) + w3 * price(H, Wed_prev) + ... ) / (w1 + w2 + w3 + ...)\n\n    But note: the Monday (2016/9/19) is the most recent day and might be the most relevant, but it is a Monday and we are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n11. Given the complexity and without a clear model, a simple approach is to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This will capture the daily pattern and also smooth out some noise.\n\n    However, note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns. We might exclude them for a weekday forecast? But we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday) and we have one Tuesday in the data. So we can do:\n\n        Option 1: Use the same hour of the previous Tuesday (2016/9/13) and adjust by the overall change from the previous Tuesday to the current Monday? \n\n        Option 2: Use the same hour of the last 3 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) and the Monday (which is the day before) and average.\n\n        Option 3: Use the average of the same hour for all 7 days.\n\n12. Let's try Option 3: average of the same hour for the last 7 days.\n\n    For hour 0:00: average of [2016/9/13 0:00, 2016/9/14 0:00, 2016/9/15 0:00, 2016/9/16 0:00, 2016/9/17 0:00, 2016/9/18 0:00, 2016/9/19 0:00]\n\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n    But note: the weekend days (2016/9/17 and 2016/9/18) are Saturday and Sunday) and they have lower prices? Let's check:\n\n        Tuesday 0:00: 23.21 -> 22.62 -> 22.20 -> 21.79 -> 23.64 -> 22.30 -> 23.68\n\n        Average for 0:00: (23.21+22.62+22.20+21.79+23.64+22.30+23.68)/7 = 159.44/7 = 22.777\n\n    However, we see that the last Monday (2016/9/19) at 0:00 was 23.68, which is above the average. So the average might be pulled down by the lower values in the middle of the week.\n\n13. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same weekday. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the only Tuesday we have (2016/9/13) and then adjust by the overall trend. But we don't have a trend model.\n\n14. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday) but that includes two weekend days and one weekday (Monday) and one weekday (Friday). This might not be representative for a Tuesday.\n\n15. Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This is a simple 7-day moving average per hour.\n\n    We compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of that hour over the 7 days.\n\n    However, note that the data we have is from 2016/9/13 (Tuesday) to 2016/9/19 (Monday). So we have 7 days.\n\n    We'll compute the average for each hour:\n\n        hour0: (23.21, 22.62, 22.20, 21.79, 23.64, 22.30, 23.68) -> 22.777\n        hour1: (22.92, 22.06, 21.17, 20.87, 23.18, 22.21, 23.47) -> 22.268\n        ... and so on.\n\n16. But note: the last day (Monday) had a significant price increase. So the average might be lower than the Monday's prices. However, we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday (2016/9/13) had lower values than Monday (2016/9/19). So the 7d average might be a reasonable baseline.\n\n17. We'll compute the 7-day averages for each hour and use that as the forecast.\n\n    However, we can also consider that the prices on 2016/9/19 (Monday) were much higher than the rest of the week. This might indicate a rising trend. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\n18. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days. For example, weights: [1,1,1,1,1,1,3] for the days from 2016/9/13 to 2016/9/19 (with the last day having weight 3). Then:\n\n        hour0: (1*23.21 + 1*22.62 + 1*22.20 + 1*21.79 + 1*23.64 + 1*22.30 + 3*23.68) / (1+1+1+1+1+1+3) = (23.21+22.62+22.20+21.79+23.64+22.30+71.04) / 9 = 226.8 / 9 = 25.2\n\n    But 25.2 is higher than the simple average. This might be more reactive to the recent increase.\n\n19. We can try a linear combination: \n        forecast = 0.5 * (same hour last Tuesday) + 0.5 * (same hour last Monday)\n    But that we have:\n        hour0: 0.5*23.21 + 0.5*23.68 = 23.445\n\n    But we don't use the other days.\n\n20. Considering the trade-off, I will use the 7-day simple average for each hour. This is a common baseline and should be robust.\n\n    We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n    Let me compute:\n\n        hour0: (23.21, 22.62, 22.20, 21.79, 23.64, 22.30, 23.68) = 159.44 / 7 = 22.777\n        hour1: (22.92, 22.06, 21.17, 20.87, 23.18, 22.21, 23.47) = 155.88 / 7 = 22.2686\n        hour2: (22.64, 21.54, 20.88, 20.71, 22.90, 21.45, 23.15) = 153.27 / 7 = 21.8957\n        hour3: (22.30, 21.57, 20.86, 20.77, 22.02, 20.78, 22.56) = 150.86 / 7 = 21.5514\n        hour4: (22.35, 22.72, 21.67, 21.00, 21.66, 20.49, 23.04) = 152.93 / 7 = 21.8471\n        hour5: (23.52, 23.45, 23.12, 22.85, 22.08, 21.15, 24.25) = 160.42 / 7 = 22.9171\n        hour6: (25.69, 25.70, 25.38, 25.65, 23.61, 21.52, 28.00) = 175.55 / 7 = 25.0786\n        hour7: (28.14, 28.35, 27.96, 26.91, 24.14, 22.61, 31.86) = 189.97 / 7 = 27.1386\n        hour8: (29.07, 29.11, 28.81, 27.17, 24.40, 23.47, 31.97) = 194.00 / 7 = 27.7143\n        hour9: (28.79, 29.13, 29.12, 26.95, 24.86, 24.12, 31.91) = 194.88 / 7 = 27.8400  [Note: 31.91?

We note that the last day (Monday) had a spike, so the average is higher than the previous days. This might be acceptable.\n\n22.
