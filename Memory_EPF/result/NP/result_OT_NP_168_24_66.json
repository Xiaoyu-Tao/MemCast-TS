        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/4/8 0:00 to 2014/4/14 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/4/15 0:00 to 2014/4/15 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values to handle.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed price) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast the next 24 hours, we have a time series with hourly frequency and clear daily patterns (as seen in the data: prices are higher during the day and lower at night). We can use a model that captures seasonality and trends.\n\n Given the constraints of this task (without using external libraries and having to provide a complete sequence), we can use a simple but effective method: \n   - Seasonal Naive method: using the same hour from the same day of the previous week. \n   Why? Because we have a weekly pattern? But note: the data we have is exactly one week (7 days) and we are to forecast the next day (which is a Tuesday?).\n\n However, note the dates: \n   - The last date in the historical data is 2014/4/14 (Monday) and we are forecasting 2014/4/15 (Tuesday).\n\n But we have data for the previous Tuesday (2014/4/8) and also the pattern of the week might be similar? However, let's look at the data: \n   - The week from 4/8 (Tuesday) to 4/14 (Monday) includes a weekend (12th and 13th are Saturday and Sunday). The weekend days have lower prices.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday (4/15), we can use the previous Tuesday (4/8) as a base? But note that the week might have changed due to holidays or other factors? We don't have that information.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last few days? But we only have 7 days.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (4/8) in the data.\n\n Considering the above, we can use:\n   - The same hour from the previous day (Monday 4/14) for Tuesday? But the pattern of Monday and Tuesday might be different.\n\n However, without more data and without the ability to use complex models, I propose:\n\n   Method: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (i.e., a 7-day moving average for each hour). This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out noise.\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) in the forecasted day (2014/4/15), we compute:\n        forecast_h = (price_h of 4/8 + price_h of 4/9 + ... + price_h of 4/14) / 7\n\n   But note: 4/8 was a Tuesday, 4/9 Wednesday, ... 4/14 Monday. And we are forecasting a Tuesday. So we are averaging over different days of the week.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same day of the week: we only have one Tuesday (4/8) and we have the next Tuesday? We don't. So we can use:\n\n        forecast_h = (price_h of the last Tuesday (4/8) + price_h of the same hour from the last 2 days (Monday and Sunday?))? \n\n   This might not be consistent.\n\n   Another idea: use the last week's same day (Tuesday) and adjust by the recent trend? But we don't have a trend model.\n\n   Given the simplicity, I will use the 7-day moving average for each hour.\n\n   Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of the forecast day:\n        Let h be the hour (0 to 23)\n        Let d0 = 2014/4/8, d1=2014/4/9, ... d6=2014/4/14 (the last 7 days)\n        Then, forecast for hour h on 2014/4/15 = (d0_h + d1_h + d2_h + d3_h + d4_h + d5_h + d6_h) / 7\n\n   This will give us 24 forecasted values.\n\n   Let's do an example for hour 0: \n        d0: 2014/4/8 0:00 -> 25.19\n        d1: 2014/4/9 0:00 -> 22.57\n        d2: 2014/4/10 0:00 -> 24.30\n        d3: 2014/4/11 0:00 -> 23.99\n        d4: 2014/4/12 0:00 -> 24.41\n        d5: 2014/4/13 0:00 -> 21.21\n        d6: 2014/4/14 0:00 -> 20.73\n\n        average = (25.19+22.57+24.30+23.99+24.41+21.21+20.73)/7 = 162.4 / 7 = 23.2\n\n   But note: the data for 2014/4/14 0:00 is 20.73, which is the last Monday. And we are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n   However, this method is simple and might capture the average behavior.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But the data doesn't seem to have extreme outliers.\n\n   Let's try with the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and the same hour from the same day last week (Tuesday) and then adjust by the difference between the last two days? \n\n   But the problem is we are only allowed to use the given data and we must provide a forecast.\n\n   I will stick to the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n   However, note: the data on 2014/4/10 and 2014/4/11 had a spike in the morning (e.g., 4/10 8:00 was 41.11, 4/11 8:00 was 38.28). These are higher than the rest. The average for 8:00 would be:\n\n        d0: 2014/4/8 8:00 -> 29.07\n        d1: 2014/4/9 8:00 -> 28.46\n        d2: 2014/4/10 8:00 -> 41.11\n        d3: 2014/4/11 8:00 -> 38.28\n        d4: 2014/4/12 8:00 -> 25.70\n        d5: 2014/4/13 8:00 -> 19.25\n        d6: 2014/4/14 8:00 -> 26.43\n\n        average = (29.07+28.46+41.11+38.28+25.70+19.25+26.43)/7 = 208.3 / 7 = 29.757\n\n   This is a reasonable value.\n\n   Therefore, we will compute the average for each hour from 0 to 23 using the last 7 days.\n\n   We'll generate the forecast for 2014/4/15 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n   Hour 0: (25.19, 22.57, 24.30, 23.99, 24.41, 21.21, 20.73) -> sum=162.4 -> 23.2\n   Hour 1: (24.15, 21.05, 23.98, 23.52, 24.08, 17.24, 16.28) -> sum=150.3 -> 21.471\n   ... and so on.\n\n   We'll compute all 24 hours.\n\n   However, note: the data for 2014/4/13 (Sunday) and 2014/4/14 (Monday) show a drop in the early hours (e.g., 1:00, 2:00) to around 16-17, which is lower than the previous days. This might be because of the weekend effect? But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we don't know.\n\n   Since we are averaging over 7 days, it will smooth out the weekend effect.\n\n   Let's do the computation for all 24 hours.\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then take the average.\n\n   Steps:\n     - Extract the data for each hour from the 7 days (each day has 24 hours, and we have 7 days).\n     - For hour i (0..23), we take the value at that hour from each of the 7 days and average.\n\n   We'll write the forecast for 2014/4/15 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n   Note: The dates in the data are from 2014/4/8 0:00 to 2014/4/14 23:00. We have 7 full days.\n\n   We'll compute:\n\n        hour0 = [25.19, 22.57, 24.30, 23.99, 24.41, 21.21, 20.73] -> average = 23.2\n        hour1 = [24.15, 21.05, 23.98, 23.52, 24.08, 17.24, 16.28] -> average = 21.471\n        hour2 = [22.78, 20.64, 23.46, 23.44, 23.80, 15.03, 16.04] -> average = 20.741\n        hour3 = [22.32, 21.75, 22.99, 23.67, 23.60, 14.36, 17.53] -> average = 20.888\n        hour4 = [23.56, 23.09, 24.08, 24.46, 23.84, 14.12, 20.34] -> average = 21.784\n        hour5 = [24.70, 24.84, 26.25, 25.94, 23.97, 14.57, 22.95] -> average = 23.174\n        hour6 = [26.51, 25.44, 28.76, 26.82, 24.39, 15.06, 24.35] -> average = 24.475\n        hour7 = [28.32, 27.27, 33.83, 30.78, 24.65, 16.27, 25.53] -> average = 26.664\n        hour8 = [29.07, 28.46, 41.11, 38.28, 25.70, 19.25, 26.43] -> average = 29.757\n        hour9 = [28.46, 27.88, 39.49, 33.80, 26.40, 20.13, 26.29] -> average = 28.921\n        hour10 = [28.12, 27.00, 33.21, 31.38, 26.16, 21.10, 25.76] -> average = 27.533\n        hour11 = [27.48, 26.52, 32.06, 29.34, 25.65, 20.94, 25.37] -> average = 26.765\n        hour12 = [26.88, 25.77, 32.02, 28.01, 24.64, 20.33, 24.67] -> average = 26.046\n        hour13 = [26.44, 25.34, 30.60, 26.85, 23.47, 19.82, 24.01] -> average = 25.219\n        hour14 = [25.95, 25.35, 29.58, 26.05, 22.84, 18.21, 23.66] -> average = 24.520\n        hour15 = [25.74, 25.42, 28.80, 25.46, 22.69, 18.34, 23.45] -> average = 24.414\n        hour16 = [25.42, 25.61, 28.62, 25.07, 23.14, 18.96, 23.26] -> average = 24.297\n        hour17 = [25.79, 26.41, 28.93, 25.36, 23.90, 21.27, 23.34] -> average = 25.000\n        hour18 = [26.47, 26.85, 29.07, 25.70, 24.22, 22.57, 23.74] -> average = 25.517\n        hour19 = [26.62, 27.32, 29.18, 25.67, 24.27, 23.35, 23.97] -> average = 25.911\n        hour20 = [26.96, 27.54, 29.45, 25.87, 24.12, 23.71, 24.11] -> average = 25.965\n        hour21 = [26.53, 27.88, 28.61, 25.70, 23.92, 23.62, 24.01] -> average = 25.896\n        hour22 = [25.50, 26.60, 26.49, 24.77, 23.34, 23.24, 23.17] -> average = 24.730\n        hour23 = [23.99, 25.74, 25.10, 23.64, 23.02, 22.60, 21.77] -> average = 23.694\n\n   We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n   Therefore, the forecast for 2014/4/15:\n\n        0:00 -> 23.20\n        1:00 -> 21.47\n        2:00 -> 20.74\n        3:00 -> 20.89\n        4:00 -> 21.78\n        5:00 -> 23.17\n        6:00 -> 24.48\n        7:00 -> 26.66\n        8:00 -> 29.76\n        9:00 -> 28.92\n        10:00 -> 27.53\n        11:00 -> 26.77\n        12:00 -> 26.05\n        13:00 -> 25.22\n        14:00 -> 24.52\n        15:00 -> 24.41\n        16:00 -> 24.30\n        17:00 -> 25.00\n        18:00 -> 25.52\n        19:00 -> 25.91\n        20:00 -> 25.97\n        21:00 -> 25.90\n        22:00 -> 24.73\n        23:00 -> 23.69\n\n   We output the forecast in the same format as the input, but for the next 24 hours starting from 2014/4/15 0:00.\n\n   Note: The date format in the input is \"YYYY/M/D H:MM\", so for 2014/4/15 0:00 we write \"2014/4/15 0:00\"\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        2014/4/15 0:00 23.20\n        2014/4/15 1:00 21.47\n        ... \n\n   We must output exactly 24 lines.\n\n   Let's write the output in the required XML-like tag.\n",
