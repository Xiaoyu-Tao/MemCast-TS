        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-09-15 00:00 to 2015-09-21 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-09-22 00:00 to 2015-09-22 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the historical observed prices (OT). Since we don't have the other variables, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\nGiven the complexity of electricity prices (seasonality, autocorrelation, etc.), we should use a time series model that can capture:\n- Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)\n- Weekly patterns (though we only have one week of data, so weekly pattern might be hard to capture)\n\nBut note: the data is only for 7 days (168 hours). We are to forecast the next day (24 hours).\n\nApproach:\n1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, there are 168 records (7*24=168). The data seems complete? However, we note that on 2015/9/18 1:00 the value is 5.49 and on 2015/9/18 2:00 it is 4.29, etc. There are no explicit missing values in the provided data. So we can proceed.\n\n2. Since we are only given the price and no exogenous variables (like load or wind), we can use a univariate time series model. Given the short history, we can use:\n   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) to model both the non-seasonal and seasonal components.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a simple model like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) that can handle seasonality.\n\nBut note: we have only 7 days of data. This is very limited for fitting a SARIMA model with multiple parameters.\n\n3. Another approach is to use a naive method that uses the average of the same hour from the previous days. For example, the price at 00:00 on the next day (2015-09-22 00:00) would be the average of the prices at 00:00 for the past 7 days (from 2015-09-15 to 2015-09-21). Similarly for each hour.\n\nHowever, we note that the week includes both weekdays and weekends. The data provided is from Tuesday (2015-09-15) to Monday (2015-09-21). The day we are forecasting is Tuesday (2015-09-22). Therefore, we can take the average of the same hour of the previous Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2015-09-15). Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days, but that might not be accurate because of the weekly pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2015-09-21) as a naive forecast? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\nGiven the data, a better approach might be to use the average of the same hour over the available days, but we note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n\n- The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2015-09-15) and also the same hour from the Monday (2015-09-21) and then take an average? But that is only two points.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days and also to the same day of the week.\n\nBut without more data, it's challenging.\n\n4. Another idea: use a moving window of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays? But we have only one full week.\n\nGiven the constraints, I propose:\n\n- We use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This is a simple and common approach for short-term forecasting in electricity markets when more sophisticated models are not feasible.\n\nSo for hour h (0 to 23) on 2015-09-22, we compute:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_h on 2015-09-15 + price_h on 2015-09-16 + ... + price_h on 2015-09-21) / 7\n\nBut note: the data for 2015-09-15 (Tuesday) to 2015-09-21 (Monday) is 7 days.\n\nLet's do this for each hour.\n\nHowever, we note that the weekend days (19th and 20th, Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices. The day 21st (Monday) is a weekday and has higher prices. The 22nd is a Tuesday, so we expect a pattern similar to the previous Tuesday (15th) and Monday (21st) but also the other weekdays.\n\nBut the simple average might smooth out the weekday/weekend effect. Since we are averaging 2 weekend days and 5 weekdays, the average might be pulled down by the weekend. However, we don't have a better alternative.\n\nAlternatively, we can use only the weekdays? But then we have 5 weekdays (15,16,17,18,21) and 2 weekend days (19,20). The 18th (Friday) is a weekday? Actually, 2015-09-18 is Friday. So we have:\n   Tuesday (15), Wednesday (16), Thursday (17), Friday (18), Saturday (19), Sunday (20), Monday (21)\n\nSo for forecasting Tuesday (22nd), we can use:\n   - The previous Tuesday (15th) and the Monday (21st) as the most similar, but also the other weekdays.\n\nBut without a clear way to weight, we stick to the simple average.\n\nLet me compute the average for each hour:\n\nWe'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the 7 days and then average.\n\nBut note: the data for the same hour might have outliers? We don't see any obvious outliers.\n\nLet me extract the data by hour:\n\nWe have 7 days, so for hour 0 (00:00):\n   [12.74, 13.80, 14.02, 10.01, 8.23, 11.92, 15.29] -> average = (12.74+13.80+14.02+10.01+8.23+11.92+15.29)/7 = 86.01/7 = 12.287\n\nSimilarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\nBut note: the data for 2015-09-18 00:00 is 10.01, and 2015-09-19 00:00 is 8.23, which are lower (weekend effect). The Tuesday we are forecasting might be more similar to the previous Tuesday (12.74) and Monday (15.29). So the average might be a bit low.\n\nHowever, without more data, we proceed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a median? But the average is more standard.\n\nGiven the time, we'll compute the average for each hour.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. There are none, so we proceed.\n\nWe'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\nHour 0 (00:00): [12.74, 13.80, 14.02, 10.01, 8.23, 11.92, 15.29] -> sum=86.01 -> avg=12.287\nHour 1 (01:00): [11.64, 13.36, 12.54, 5.49, 6.63, 9.96, 14.67] -> sum=74.29 -> avg=10.613\nHour 2 (02:00): [11.49, 13.49, 12.15, 4.29, 6.01, 9.41, 14.49] -> sum=71.33 -> avg=10.190\nHour 3 (03:00): [11.18, 14.01, 12.08, 4.03, 6.02, 9.37, 14.73] -> sum=71.42 -> avg=10.203\nHour 4 (04:00): [11.77, 14.52, 12.18, 4.86, 6.44, 9.81, 15.38] -> sum=74.96 -> avg=10.709\nHour 5 (05:00): [13.34, 15.90, 15.06, 9.08, 8.52, 10.19, 16.85] -> sum=88.94 -> avg=12.706\nHour 6 (06:00): [17.86, 20.73, 20.25, 15.93, 12.17, 12.67, 21.35] -> sum=120.96 -> avg=17.280\nHour 7 (07:00): [21.48, 23.71, 22.53, 19.00, 14.06, 14.05, 24.66] -> sum=139.49 -> avg=19.927\nHour 8 (08:00): [22.17, 25.04, 23.57, 20.29, 15.47, 15.23, 25.38] -> sum=147.15 -> avg=21.021\nHour 9 (09:00): [22.20, 25.59, 23.18, 20.27, 15.85, 15.58, 24.99] -> sum=147.66 -> avg=21.094\nHour 10 (10:00): [21.88, 25.44, 22.71, 20.21, 16.49, 15.64, 24.80] -> sum=147.17 -> avg=21.024\nHour 11 (11:00): [21.61, 24.95, 21.95, 19.69, 16.47, 15.76, 24.33] -> sum=144.76 -> avg=20.680\nHour 12 (12:00): [21.57, 24.39, 21.75, 18.53, 16.02, 15.55, 23.64] -> sum=141.45 -> avg=20.207\nHour 13 (13:00): [21.55, 24.36, 21.48, 17.60, 15.78, 15.40, 23.62] -> sum=139.79 -> avg=19.970\nHour 14 (14:00): [20.77, 23.22, 20.80, 16.10, 15.56, 15.35, 22.85] -> sum=134.65 -> avg=19.236\nHour 15 (15:00): [21.13, 23.16, 20.83, 16.11, 15.48, 15.30, 23.20] -> sum=135.21 -> avg=19.316\nHour 16 (16:00): [21.13, 22.57, 20.82, 16.03, 15.43, 15.25, 22.99] -> sum=134.22 -> avg=19.174\nHour 17 (17:00): [21.62, 22.55, 20.86, 16.97, 15.45, 16.72, 23.38] -> sum=137.55 -> avg=19.650\nHour 18 (18:00): [21.85, 22.35, 20.81, 17.88, 15.77, 18.90, 23.72] -> sum=141.28 -> avg=20.183\nHour 19 (19:00): [22.23, 22.47, 21.16, 18.92, 16.33, 20.89, 24.28] -> sum=146.28 -> avg=20.897\nHour 20 (20:00): [21.91, 21.45, 20.45, 17.48, 15.96, 21.48, 22.90] -> sum=141.63 -> avg=20.233\nHour 21 (21:00): [20.55, 20.26, 19.02, 15.79, 15.40, 19.82, 21.01] -> sum=131.85 -> avg=18.836\nHour 22 (22:00): [17.87, 16.65, 15.88, 15.10, 15.12, 17.56, 17.26] -> sum=115.44 -> avg=16.491\nHour 23 (23:00): [14.94, 14.06, 13.87, 12.33, 12.40, 15.70, 15.25] -> sum=98.55 -> avg=14.079\n\nSo the forecast for 2015-09-22 (Tuesday) from 00:00 to 23:00 would be:\n\n00:00: 12.29\n01:00: 10.61\n02:00: 10.19\n03:00: 10.20\n04:00: 10.71\n05:00: 12.71\n06:00: 17.28\n07:00: 19.93\n08:00: 21.02\n09:00: 21.09\n10:00: 21.02\n11:00: 20.68\n12:00: 20.21\n13:00: 19.97\n14:00: 19.24\n15:00: 19.32\n16:00: 19.17\n17:00: 19.65\n18:00: 20.18\n19:00: 20.90\n20:00: 20.23\n21:00: 18.84\n22:00: 16.49\n23:00: 14.08\n\nBut note: we must output with two decimal places? The input data has two decimal places. We'll round to two decimals.\n\nHowever, the average we computed might have more than two decimals. We'll round to two.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Observed Nord Pool electricity price (\u20ac/MWh, 1-hour resolution)\" and the data has two decimals.\n\nSo we'll round the averages to two decimal places.\n\nLet me recalculate with rounding:\n\nWe'll compute each average and round to two decimals.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the exact value and then round.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n00:00: 12.287 -> 12.29\n01:00: 10.613 -> 10.61\n02:00: 10.190 -> 10.19\n03:00: 10.203 -> 10.20\n04:00: 10.709 -> 10.71\n05:00: 12.706 -> 12.71\n06:00: 17.280 -> 17.28\n07:00: 19.927 -> 19.93\n08:00: 21.021 -> 21.02\n09:00: 21.094 -> 21.09\n10:00: 21.024 -> 21.02\n11:00: 20.680 -> 20.68\n12:00: 20.207 -> 20.21\n13:00: 19.970 -> 19.97\n14:00: 19.236 -> 19.24\n15:00: 19.316 -> 19.32\n16:00: 19.174 -> 19.17\n17:00: 19.650 -> 19.65\n18:00: 20.183 -> 20.18\n19:00: 20.897 -> 20.90\n20:00: 20.233 -> 20.23\n21:00: 18.836 -> 18.84\n22:00: 16.491 -> 16.49\n23:00: 14.079 -> 14.08\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the next 24 recorded hours\" starting from 2015-09-22 00:00 to 2015-09-22 23:00.\n\nSo we output:\n\n2015/9/22 0:00 12.29\n2015/9/22 1:00 10.61\n2015/9/22 2:00 10.19\n2015/9/22 3:00 10.20\n2015/9/22 4:00 10.71\n2015/9/22 5:00 12.71\n2015/9/22 6:00 17.28\n2015/9/22 7:00 19.93\n2015/9/22 8:00 21.02\n2015/9/22 9:00 21.09\n2015/9/22 10:00 21.02\n2015/9/22 11:00 20.68\n2015/9/22 12:00 20.21\n2015/9/22 13:00 19.97\n2015/9/22 14:00 19.24\n2015/9/22 15:00 19.32\n2015/9/22 16:00 19.17\n2015/9/22 17:00 19.65\n2015/9/22 18:00 20.18\n2015/9/22 19:00 20.90\n2015/9/22 20:00 20.23\n2015/9/22 21:00 18.84\n2015/9/22 22:00 16.49\n2015/9/22 23:00 14.08\n\nThis is a simple but reasonable forecast given the data.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values.
