        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-02-24 00:00 to 2015-03-02 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-03-03 00:00 to 2015-03-03 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on a time series model that uses only the target variable.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a model that captures daily seasonality (24-hour period) and possibly weekly seasonality (168-hour period). However, with only one week of data, weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n Given the complexity and the need for a short-term forecast, we can consider:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters with daily seasonality)\n   - A simple approach: use the average of the same hour from the previous days, or a moving window.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - A daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Some volatility (e.g., on 2015-02-25 18:00 the price spiked to 32.94).\n\n Given the constraints (only 168 points and no exogenous variables) and the requirement for a quick forecast, we can use a simple method:\n\n Method: \n   We will use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (the entire available history) to forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n Why this method?\n   - It captures the daily seasonality.\n   - It is simple and handles the data without requiring complex modeling.\n\n Steps for the method:\n   For each hour h in [0, 23] (where h=0 for 00:00, h=1 for 01:00, ... h=23 for 23:00):\n        forecast_h = average of the prices at hour h for the 7 days we have (from 2015-02-24 to 2015-03-02)\n\n Example for hour 0:00:\n        We have 7 values: \n            2015-02-24 00:00: 24.98\n            2015-02-25 00:00: 23.66\n            2015-02-26 00:00: 25.64\n            2015-02-27 00:00: 22.22\n            2015-02-28 00:00: 25.91\n            2015-03-01 00:00: 22.53\n            2015-03-02 00:00: 22.02\n\n        Average = (24.98 + 23.66 + 25.64 + 22.22 + 25.91 + 22.53 + 22.02) / 7 = 23.994\n\n But note: the data for 2015-03-02 is the last day, and we are forecasting 2015-03-03.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the spike on 2015-02-25 might be an outlier. But since it only occurred once, the average will smooth it.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a median to be robust to outliers. Let's test:\n\n For hour 18:00 (which had the spike on 2015-02-25):\n        Values:\n            2015-02-24 18:00: 27.07\n            2015-02-25 18:00: 32.94   <-- outlier\n            2015-02-26 18:00: 26.80\n            2015-02-27 18:00: 27.60\n            2015-02-28 18:00: 26.31\n            2015-03-01 18:00: 25.70\n            2015-03-02 18:00: 27.23\n\n        Average = (27.07+32.94+26.80+27.60+26.31+25.70+27.23)/7 = 27.664\n        Median: sort: 25.70, 26.31, 26.80, 27.07, 27.23, 27.60, 32.94 -> median is 27.07\n\n The median might be better for this hour because of the spike.\n\n Considering the potential for outliers, we decide to use the median for each hour.\n\n Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n   Let values = [ price at hour h of day 1 (2015-02-24), day 2 (2015-02-25), ... day 7 (2015-03-02) ]\n   forecast_h = median(values)\n\n We then output the 24 forecasted values for 2015-03-03 from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n However, note: the data shows a trend? Let's look at the last few days:\n\n   The prices on 2015-03-01 and 2015-03-02 are generally lower than the beginning of the week.\n\n   We might also consider using a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? \n   with only 7 days, we can try a simple approach: use the median without weighting.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last 3 days to be more responsive? But the problem says we have 168 hours (7 days) and we are to use the data.\n\n   Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to handle missing values (which we don't have) and provide a forecast, we choose the median of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) of the 7 values.\n\n We note the dates in the data:\n\n   Day 1: 2015-02-24 (Tuesday)\n   Day 2: 2015-02-25 (Wednesday)\n   Day 3: 2015-02-26 (Thursday)\n   Day 4: 2015-02-27 (Friday)\n   Day 5: 2015-02-28 (Saturday)\n   Day 6: 2015-03-01 (Sunday)\n   Day 7: 2015-03-02 (Monday)\n\n We are forecasting 2015-03-03 (Tuesday). So we are using the same day of the week as 2015-02-24 (Tuesday) and also the other days.\n\n But note: the pattern on Tuesday might be different from Sunday. However, we have only one Tuesday (2015-02-24) and one Monday (2015-03-02) etc.\n\n Since we have only one week, we cannot capture weekly seasonality by day of week. Therefore, we use all 7 days.\n\n We'll compute the median for each hour.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll group the data by hour of the day (0 to 23) and then for each hour, take the 7 values and compute the median.\n\n   The historical data is in chronological order. We can extract:\n\n        hour0: [24.98, 23.66, 25.64, 22.22, 25.91, 22.53, 22.02]\n        hour1: [24.64, 23.25, 25.26, 21.95, 25.42, 21.68, 20.59]\n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then for each hour, sort the list and pick the middle value (the 4th in a 7-element list).\n\n Let's do the computation:\n\n   Hour 0 (00:00): [24.98, 23.66, 25.64, 22.22, 25.91, 22.53, 22.02] \n        sorted: [22.02, 22.22, 22.53, 23.66, 24.98, 25.64, 25.91] -> median = 23.66\n\n   Hour 1 (01:00): [24.64, 23.25, 25.26, 21.95, 25.42, 21.68, 20.59]\n        sorted: [20.59, 21.68, 21.95, 23.25, 24.64, 25.26, 25.42] -> median = 23.25\n\n   Hour 2 (02:00): [23.90, 23.10, 25.07, 22.02, 25.10, 21.11, 20.53]\n        sorted: [20.53, 21.11, 22.02, 23.10, 23.90, 25.07, 25.10] -> median = 23.10\n\n   Hour 3 (03:00): [24.00, 23.39, 25.08, 23.00, 25.10, 20.87, 21.54]\n        sorted: [20.87, 21.54, 23.00, 23.39, 24.00, 25.08, 25.10] -> median = 23.39\n\n   Hour 4 (04:00): [24.93, 24.19, 25.55, 24.21, 25.16, 20.17, 22.69]\n        sorted: [20.17, 22.69, 24.19, 24.21, 24.93, 25.16, 25.55] -> median = 24.21\n\n   Hour 5 (05:00): [25.51, 25.33, 26.13, 25.30, 25.50, 19.77, 24.15]\n        sorted: [19.77, 24.15, 25.30, 25.33, 25.50, 25.51, 26.13] -> median = 25.33\n\n   Hour 6 (06:00): [26.50, 26.31, 26.92, 26.43, 25.53, 19.78, 26.50]\n        sorted: [19.78, 25.53, 26.31, 26.43, 26.50, 26.50, 26.92] -> median = 26.43\n\n   Hour 7 (07:00): [27.23, 27.55, 28.92, 26.97, 26.08, 19.91, 27.21]\n        sorted: [19.91, 26.08, 26.97, 27.21, 27.23, 27.55, 28.92] -> median = 27.21\n\n   Hour 8 (08:00): [27.41, 27.97, 29.13, 27.36, 26.37, 21.75, 27.49]\n        sorted: [21.75, 26.37, 27.36, 27.41, 27.49, 27.97, 29.13] -> median = 27.41\n\n   Hour 9 (09:00): [27.10, 27.91, 28.00, 27.29, 26.41, 23.07, 27.24]\n        sorted: [23.07, 26.41, 27.10, 27.24, 27.29, 27.91, 28.00] -> median = 27.24\n\n   Hour 10 (10:00): [26.98, 27.80, 27.42, 27.24, 26.42, 23.76, 27.15]\n        sorted: [23.76, 26.42, 26.98, 27.15, 27.24, 27.42, 27.80] -> median = 27.15\n\n   Hour 11 (11:00): [26.74, 27.32, 26.82, 26.85, 26.23, 24.01, 26.86]\n        sorted: [24.01, 26.23, 26.74, 26.82, 26.85, 26.86, 27.32] -> median = 26.85\n\n   Hour 12 (12:00): [26.50, 27.22, 26.45, 26.64, 25.65, 23.33, 26.28]\n        sorted: [23.33, 25.65, 26.28, 26.45, 26.50, 26.64, 27.22] -> median = 26.45\n\n   Hour 13 (13:00): [26.49, 27.12, 26.34, 26.54, 24.83, 23.26, 26.13]\n        sorted: [23.26, 24.83, 26.13, 26.34, 26.49, 26.54, 27.12] -> median = 26.34\n\n   Hour 14 (14:00): [26.54, 27.22, 26.28, 26.52, 24.80, 23.02, 26.31]\n        sorted: [23.02, 24.80, 26.28, 26.31, 26.52, 26.54, 27.22] -> median = 26.31\n\n   Hour 15 (15:00): [26.46, 27.21, 26.16, 26.43, 24.91, 23.32, 26.50]\n        sorted: [23.32, 24.91, 26.16, 26.43, 26.46, 26.50, 27.21] -> median = 26.43\n\n   Hour 16 (16:00): [26.50, 27.31, 26.22, 26.56, 25.33, 24.12, 26.56]\n        sorted: [24.12, 25.33, 26.22, 26.50, 26.56, 26.56, 27.31] -> median = 26.50\n\n   Hour 17 (17:00): [26.90, 28.39, 26.71, 27.00, 26.16, 25.03, 26.98]\n        sorted: [25.03, 26.16, 26.71, 26.90, 26.98, 27.00, 28.39] -> median = 26.90\n\n   Hour 18 (18:00): [27.07, 32.94, 26.80, 27.60, 26.31, 25.70, 27.23]\n        sorted: [25.70, 26.31, 26.80, 27.07, 27.23, 27.60, 32.94] -> median = 27.07\n\n   Hour 19 (19:00): [26.59, 28.55, 26.29, 26.80, 25.76, 25.66, 26.75]\n        sorted: [25.66, 25.76, 26.29, 26.59, 26.75, 26.80, 28.55] -> median = 26.59\n\n   Hour 20 (20:00): [26.17, 27.34, 25.99, 26.19, 24.89, 24.88, 26.23]\n        sorted: [24.88, 24.89, 25.99, 26.17, 26.19, 26.23, 27.34] -> median = 26.17\n\n   Hour 21 (21:00): [25.92, 26.83, 25.62, 26.07, 23.90, 24.35, 25.86]\n        sorted: [23.90, 24.35, 25.62, 25.86, 25.92, 26.07, 26.83] -> median = 25.86\n\n   Hour 22 (22:00): [25.37, 26.44, 25.14, 25.72, 23.09, 23.95, 24.96]\n        sorted: [23.09, 23.95, 24.96, 25.14, 25.37, 25.72, 26.44] -> median = 25.14\n\n   Hour 23 (23:00): [24.64, 25.96, 24.09, 25.28, 22.28, 22.73, 23.90]\n        sorted: [22.28, 22.73, 23.90, 24.09, 24.64, 25.28, 25.96] -> median = 24.09\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2015-03-03 (Tuesday) from 00:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n   00:00: 23.66\n   01:00: 23.25\n   02:00: 23.10\n   03:00: 23.39\n   04:00: 24.21\n   05:00: 25.33\n   06:00: 26.43\n   07:00: 27.21\n   08:00: 27.41\n   09:00: 27.24\n   10:00: 27.15\n   11:00: 26.85\n   12:00: 26.45\n   13:00: 26.34\n   14:00: 26.31\n   15:00: 26.43\n   16:00: 26.50\n   17:00: 26.90\n   18:00: 27.07\n   19:00: 26.59\n   20:00: 26.17\n   21:00: 25.86\n   22:00: 25.14\n   23:00: 24.09\n\n We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA or machine learning) if more data and exogenous variables are available.
