        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/4/22 0:00 to 2014/4/28 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/4/29 0:00 to 2014/4/29 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we note that the last date is 2014/4/28 23:00, so the next 24 hours are 2014/4/29 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) in the test data, we must rely on a time series model that uses only the target variable.\n\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n 4. We can use a simple model like a seasonal naive model (using the same hour from the previous day) or an exponential smoothing model. But note that the data shows a clear daily pattern.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an ARIMA model with seasonal components. However, without the ability to run complex model fitting here, we need a simple and effective method.\n\n 6. Considering the requirement for a quick and robust forecast, we can use the following approach:\n    - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of the same hour over the past 7 days (if available) and adjust by the recent trend.\n\n 7. However, note that the last day (2014/4/28) is a Monday. The next day is Tuesday (2014/4/29). We have data for the previous Tuesday (2014/4/22) and also the pattern of the week.\n\n 8. We can compute the average for each hour of the day for the available days (7 days) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 24 hours compared to the same day a week ago.\n\n 9. But note: the data from 2014/4/22 (Tuesday) to 2014/4/28 (Monday) covers 7 days. We can calculate the average for each hour over these 7 days and then adjust by the difference between the last day (Monday) and the previous Monday? However, we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where recent days are given more weight.\n\n 11. Since the problem does not specify the method, we choose a simple method: use the average of the same hour from the last three days (which are Sunday, Monday, and the previous Tuesday? but we have only one week). Instead, we can use the same hour from the same day of the week? But we have only one Tuesday (2014/4/22) and the next day is Tuesday.\n\n 12. We can do:\n     - For each hour h (0 to 23) on the forecast day (Tuesday), we take the value from the previous Tuesday (2014/4/22) at hour h, and then adjust by the average change from the last Tuesday to the last day (Monday) for that hour.\n\n 13. However, that might be too simplistic. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (Sunday, Monday, and Saturday) and then adjust for the day of the week effect? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n 14. Given the constraints, we will use a moving average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for forecasting Tuesday? But note: the pattern of Tuesday might be different.\n\n 15. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the same day of the previous week (i.e., the Tuesday a week ago) and the same hour from the last two days (Sunday and Monday) with weights. For example, 50% from the same day last week and 50% from the average of the last two days? But we don't have a strong reason.\n\n 16. Considering the data, we have 7 days. We can compute the average for each hour over the entire week and then adjust by the trend of the last day.\n\n 17. We note that the prices on 2014/4/28 (Monday) are generally higher than on 2014/4/22 (Tuesday). So we can compute the average for each hour for the week and then adjust by the ratio of Monday's price to the average of Monday? But we don't have multiple Mondays.\n\n 18. A simpler approach: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) as the forecast for Tuesday? But we know that weekdays have different patterns.\n\n 19. We can use the following method:\n     Let F(t) be the forecast for hour h on day d (Tuesday, 2014/4/29) at hour h.\n     We have:\n        F(h) = (P_last_tuesday(h) + P_last_monday(h) * (1 + (P_last_monday(h) - P_prev_monday(h)) / P_prev_monday(h)) ) / 2 \n     But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n 20. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 7 days, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out noise.\n\n 21. However, we note that the last day (Monday) might be more representative. So we can use a weighted average with higher weights for more recent days.\n\n 22. We choose weights: assign weights that decrease as we go back in time. For example, for the same hour, we assign:\n     w(day-1) = 0.4, w(day-2)=0.3, w(day-3)=0.2, w(day-4)=0.1, and the rest 0? But we have 7 days. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing weights.\n\n 23. We can use a simple average of the last 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for the same hour. Why 3? Because it's recent and includes a weekend and a Monday. The next day is Tuesday, which is a weekday. The last Tuesday (a week ago) is also a weekday, but we don't have more Tuesdays.\n\n 24. We decide to use the average of the same hour for the last Tuesday (2014/4/22) and the same hour for the last two days (Sunday and Monday). Then average these three? But that would be three points.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use:\n     F(h) = (P_last_tuesday(h) + P_sunday(h) + P_monday(h)) / 3\n\n 26. But note: Sunday and Monday are not Tuesdays. We might be introducing noise.\n\n 27. After reviewing the data, we see that the pattern for weekdays (Monday to Friday) is similar and weekends are different. Since 2014/4/29 is a weekday (Tuesday), we can use the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the past week? But we only have one Tuesday, one Monday, one Friday, etc.\n\n 28. We have the following weekdays in the data:\n     Tuesday (2014/4/22), Wednesday (2014/4/23), Thursday (2014/4/24), Friday (2014/4/25), and Monday (2014/4/28). Note: Saturday and Sunday are weekends.\n\n 29. So for the forecast, we can take the average of the same hour for the weekdays we have (5 days: 22,23,24,25,28) for each hour.\n\n 30. However, the last day (Monday) might be more relevant. We can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent weekdays.\n\n 31. We choose to use weights: \n     Monday (2014/4/28): weight 0.4\n     Friday (2014/4/25): weight 0.2\n     Thursday (2014/4/24): weight 0.2\n     Wednesday (2014/4/23): weight 0.1\n     Tuesday (2014/4/22): weight 0.1\n\n 32. Then the forecast for hour h on Tuesday is:\n     F(h) = (0.4 * P_28(h) + 0.2 * P_25(h) + 0.2 * P_24(h) + 0.1 * P_23(h) + 0.1 * P_22(h))\n\n 33. But note: the day of the week effect: Tuesday might be more similar to the previous Tuesday? However, we are giving low weight to the previous Tuesday.\n\n 34. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (which are Friday, Monday, and Thursday? but note the weekend in between). \n\n 35. Given the time, we decide to use the simple average of the same hour for the last three weekdays: \n        Friday (2014/4/25), Monday (2014/4/28), and also include the previous Tuesday (2014/4/22) to represent Tuesday? \n     But we have only one Tuesday. We can do:\n        F(h) = (P_22(h) + P_25(h) + P_28(h)) / 3\n\n 36. However, we note that 2014/4/25 (Friday) and 2014/4/28 (Monday) are adjacent weekdays, and 2014/4/22 (Tuesday) is from the same day of the week as the forecast day. So we can do:\n        F(h) = 0.5 * P_22(h) + 0.25 * P_25(h) + 0.25 * P_28(h)\n\n 37. We don't have a strong basis for the weights, so we choose equal weights for the three days.\n\n 38. Let's try with the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays that we have: \n        Friday (25th), Monday (28th), and the Tuesday of last week (22nd). \n\n 39. But note: the Monday is the most recent and might be the most relevant. We can do:\n        F(h) = (P_28(h) * 0.5 + (P_22(h) + P_25(h)) * 0.25)\n\n 40. We decide to use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (25th, 28th, and 22nd) with equal weights.\n\n 41. However, we must check if there are any missing values? The provided data does not have missing values.\n\n 42. We will calculate for each hour from 0 to 23 for the next day (2014/4/29) the average of:\n        - The hour h on 2014/4/22 (Tuesday)\n        - The hour h on 2014/4/25 (Friday)\n        - The hour h on 2014/4/28 (Monday)\n\n 43. Example for hour 0: \n        (23.66 + 23.32 + 21.99) / 3 = (23.66+23.32+21.99)=68.97/3 \u2248 22.99\n\n 44. But note: the data for 2014/4/22 0:00 is 21.88? Actually, we have:\n        2014/4/22 0:00: 21.88\n        2014/4/25 0:00: 23.32\n        2014/4/28 0:00: 21.99\n\n        So (21.88 + 23.32 + 21.99) / 3 = 67.19 / 3 = 22.3967 \u2248 22.40\n\n 45. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 46. However, we note that the weekend days (26th and 27th) are not included. This is because we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday) and we are using weekdays.\n\n 47. We compute the forecast for each hour.\n\n 48. We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 49. The forecast for 2014/4/29 0:00 to 23:00:\n\n Let's compute:\n\n Hour 0: (21.88 + 23.32 + 21.99) / 3 = (21.88+23.32=45.2; 45.2+21.99=67.19) -> 67.19/3 = 22.3967 -> 22.40\n Hour 1: (21.21 + 23.01 + 21.74) / 3 = (21.21+23.01=44.22; 44.22+21.74=65.96) -> 65.96/3 = 21.9867 -> 21.99\n Hour 2: (20.94 + 22.98 + 21.67) / 3 = (20.94+22.98=43.92; 43.92+21.67=65.59) -> 65.59/3 = 21.8633 -> 21.86\n Hour 3: (21.21 + 23.09 + 21.74) / 3 = (21.21+23.09=44.3; 44.3+21.74=66.04) -> 66.04/3 = 22.0133 -> 22.01\n Hour 4: (22.41 + 23.47 + 21.89) / 3 = (22.41+23.47=45.88; 45.88+21.89=67.77) -> 67.77/3 = 22.59\n Hour 5: (23.53 + 24.82 + 24.05) / 3 = (23.53+24.82=48.35; 48.35+24.05=72.4) -> 72.4/3 = 24.1333 -> 24.13\n Hour 6: (24.51 + 26.86 + 26.72) / 3 = (24.51+26.86=51.37; 51.37+26.72=78.09) -> 78.09/3 = 26.03\n Hour 7: (25.85 + 29.18 + 28.84) / 3 = (25.85+29.18=55.03; 55.03+28.84=83.87) -> 83.87/3 = 27.9567 -> 27.96\n Hour 8: (26.59 + 30.66 + 29.25) / 3 = (26.59+30.66=57.25; 57.25+29.25=86.5) -> 86.5/3 = 28.8333 -> 28.83\n Hour 9: (26.36 + 29.97 + 28.97) / 3 = (26.36+29.97=56.33; 56.33+28.97=85.3) -> 85.3/3 = 28.4333 -> 28.43\n Hour 10: (26.03 + 29.10 + 28.84) / 3 = (26.03+29.10=55.13; 55.13+28.84=83.97) -> 83.97/3 = 27.99\n Hour 11: (25.66 + 28.33 + 28.10) / 3 = (25.66+28.33=53.99; 53.99+28.10=82.09) -> 82.09/3 = 27.3633 -> 27.36\n Hour 12: (25.31 + 27.39 + 27.61) / 3 = (25.31+27.39=52.7; 52.7+27.61=80.31) -> 80.31/3 = 26.77\n Hour 13: (24.93 + 26.82 + 27.43) / 3 = (24.93+26.82=51.75; 51.75+27.43=79.18) -> 79.18/3 = 26.3933 -> 26.39\n Hour 14: (24.73 + 26.32 + 27.00) / 3 = (24.73+26.32=51.05; 51.05+27.00=78.05) -> 78.05/3 = 26.0167 -> 26.02\n Hour 15: (24.50 + 25.99 + 26.77) / 3 = (24.50+25.99=50.49; 50.49+26.77=77.26) -> 77.26/3 = 25.7533 -> 25.75\n Hour 16: (24.24 + 25.78 + 26.65) / 3 = (24.24+25.78=50.02; 50.02+26.65=76.67) -> 76.67/3 = 25.5567 -> 25.56\n Hour 17: (24.54 + 25.78 + 26.49) / 3 = (24.54+25.78=50.32; 50.32+26.49=76.81) -> 76.81/3 = 25.6033 -> 25.60\n Hour 18: (24.54 + 25.90 + 26.74) / 3 = (24.54+25.90=50.44; 50.44+26.74=77.18) -> 77.18/3 = 25.7267 -> 25.73\n Hour 19: (24.61 + 25.80 + 26.71) / 3 = (24.61+25.80=50.41; 50.41+26.71=77.12) -> 77.12/3 = 25.7067 -> 25.71\n Hour 20: (24.77 + 25.83 + 26.82) / 3 = (24.77+25.83=50.6; 50.6+26.82=77.42) -> 77.42/3 = 25.8067 -> 25.81\n Hour 21: (24.65 + 25.94 + 26.76) / 3 = (24.65+25.94=50.59; 50.59+26.76=77.35) -> 77.35/3 = 25.7833 -> 25.78\n Hour 22: (23.84 + 24.71 + 26.22) / 3 = (23.84+24.71=48.55; 48.55+26.22=74.77) -> 74.77/3 = 24.9233 -> 24.92\n Hour 23: (22.43 + 23.44 + 24.13) / 3 = (22.43+23.44=45.87; 45.87+24.13=70.0) -> 70.0/3 = 23.3333 -> 23.33\n\n 50.
