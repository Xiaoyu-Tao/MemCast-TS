        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-04-15 00:00 to 2014-04-21 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., 2014-04-22 00:00 to 2014-04-22 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 records (7 days * 24 hours). There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, capturing weekly seasonality might be challenging.\n\n 4. We can use a model that handles seasonality, such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day or same hour of the previous week.\n    - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n    - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model.\n\n 5. Given the short history (only 7 days) and the requirement for a quick forecast, we might choose a simple method that captures the daily pattern.\n\n 6. Let's consider the average of the last 7 days for each hour. However, note that the last day (2014-04-21) is a Monday? Actually, 2014-04-15 was a Tuesday. We have 7 days: Tuesday (15) to Monday (21). So the next day is Tuesday (22) which is the same as the first day in the data (15th).\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., the first day in the data) as the forecast? But note: the first day was 2014-04-15 (Tuesday) and we are forecasting 2014-04-22 (also Tuesday). So we can use the values from 2014-04-15 as the forecast for 2014-04-22? However, this ignores the recent trend.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. But note that the pattern on weekends (19th and 20th) might be different. However, 19th was Saturday, 20th Sunday, and 21st Monday. The next day is Tuesday.\n\n 9. We can also use a weighted average where more recent days are given higher weights.\n\n 10. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are forecasting a Tuesday and we have a Tuesday from a week ago, we can try to adjust the previous Tuesday by the recent trend.\n\n 11. However, without more data and without exogenous variables, we have to rely on the pattern.\n\n 12. Let me try to compute the average of the same hour for the last 3 Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2014-04-15). So that won't work.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 24 hours? \n\n 14. Since the problem does not specify the method, I will use a simple method: the average of the same hour over the available 7 days. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out some noise.\n\n 15. But note: the data shows a drop in prices on the weekend (19th and 20th) and then a recovery on Monday (21st). Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we have only one Tuesday in the history (15th). So we can also consider:\n\n     Option A: Use the values from the previous Tuesday (15th) as the forecast for the 22nd.\n\n     Option B: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n     Option C: Use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Sunday, Monday, and Saturday? but that might not be representative for Tuesday).\n\n 16. Given that we have only one week of data and the next day is the same day of the week as the first day, and the first day is 7 days ago, we can also consider the change from the previous week to the current week? But we don't have multiple weeks.\n\n 17. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week in the available history. But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n 18. Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour over the entire week (7 days) to capture the daily pattern. This is a common approach.\n\n 19. Steps for the average method:\n      For hour h (where h from 0 to 23), the forecast for 2014-04-22 at hour h is:\n          avg_h = (price_day1_h + price_day2_h + ... + price_day7_h) / 7\n\n 20. But note: the data we have is from 2014-04-15 (day1) to 2014-04-21 (day7). So for hour 0 (midnight) we average the 7 values at 0:00.\n\n 21. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: (21.00 + 24.43 + 23.11 + 22.62 + 24.06 + 21.45 + 21.44) / 7\n      Hour 1: (20.02 + 24.39 + 22.13 + 22.31 + 23.90 + 19.77 + 19.58) / 7\n      ... and so on.\n\n 22. However, note that the data for the weekend (19th and 20th) is lower, and the Monday (21st) is also a weekday? Actually, 21st is Monday. So including the weekend might lower the average for a Tuesday.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we can use only the weekdays? But we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n 24. Given the constraints, I will use the 7-day average.\n\n 25. Let me calculate the averages:\n\n      Hour 0: (21.00, 24.43, 23.11, 22.62, 24.06, 21.45, 21.44) \n          = (21.00+24.43+23.11+22.62+24.06+21.45+21.44) / 7 = 158.11 / 7 = 22.5871 \u2248 22.59\n\n      Hour 1: (20.02, 24.39, 22.13, 22.31, 23.90, 19.77, 19.58)\n          = (20.02+24.39+22.13+22.31+23.90+19.77+19.58) / 7 = 152.1 / 7 = 21.7286 \u2248 21.73\n\n      Hour 2: (19.65, 24.34, 21.65, 22.33, 23.80, 20.01, 19.89)\n          = (19.65+24.34+21.65+22.33+23.80+20.01+19.89) / 7 = 151.67 / 7 = 21.6671 \u2248 21.67\n\n      Hour 3: (20.57, 24.41, 21.62, 21.23, 23.59, 19.87, 19.87)\n          = (20.57+24.41+21.62+21.23+23.59+19.87+19.87) / 7 = 151.16 / 7 = 21.5943 \u2248 21.59\n\n      Hour 4: (21.90, 24.70, 22.35, 22.08, 23.73, 19.88, 20.07)\n          = (21.90+24.70+22.35+22.08+23.73+19.88+20.07) / 7 = 154.71 / 7 = 22.1014 \u2248 22.10\n\n      Hour 5: (22.90, 25.84, 23.68, 22.51, 23.84, 20.05, 20.45)\n          = (22.90+25.84+23.68+22.51+23.84+20.05+20.45) / 7 = 159.27 / 7 = 22.7529 \u2248 22.75\n\n      Hour 6: (24.19, 26.62, 24.09, 22.41, 23.87, 19.79, 20.74)\n          = (24.19+26.62+24.09+22.41+23.87+19.79+20.74) / 7 = 161.71 / 7 = 23.1014 \u2248 23.10\n\n      Hour 7: (25.66, 28.99, 24.76, 23.11, 24.24, 19.75, 21.05)\n          = (25.66+28.99+24.76+23.11+24.24+19.75+21.05) / 7 = 167.56 / 7 = 23.9371 \u2248 23.94\n\n      Hour 8: (26.18, 29.59, 24.87, 23.74, 24.76, 20.82, 22.07)\n          = (26.18+29.59+24.87+23.74+24.76+20.82+22.07) / 7 = 172.03 / 7 = 24.5757 \u2248 24.58\n\n      Hour 9: (25.99, 28.54, 24.77, 24.02, 25.28, 22.76, 23.29)\n          = (25.99+28.54+24.77+24.02+25.28+22.76+23.29) / 7 = 174.65 / 7 = 24.95 \u2248 24.95\n\n      Hour 10: (25.91, 27.87, 24.62, 24.10, 25.05, 23.21, 23.37)\n          = (25.91+27.87+24.62+24.10+25.05+23.21+23.37) / 7 = 174.13 / 7 = 24.8757 \u2248 24.88\n\n      Hour 11: (25.68, 26.91, 24.37, 24.06, 24.92, 23.10, 23.03)\n          = (25.68+26.91+24.37+24.06+24.92+23.10+23.03) / 7 = 172.07 / 7 = 24.5814 \u2248 24.58\n\n      Hour 12: (25.05, 25.83, 23.84, 23.88, 24.54, 22.32, 22.47)\n          = (25.05+25.83+23.84+23.88+24.54+22.32+22.47) / 7 = 167.93 / 7 = 23.99 \u2248 23.99\n\n      Hour 13: (24.83, 25.31, 23.44, 23.68, 23.87, 22.31, 21.54)\n          = (24.83+25.31+23.44+23.68+23.87+22.31+21.54) / 7 = 164.98 / 7 = 23.5686 \u2248 23.57\n\n      Hour 14: (24.36, 24.92, 23.01, 23.48, 22.49, 21.77, 21.19)\n          = (24.36+24.92+23.01+23.48+22.49+21.77+21.19) / 7 = 161.22 / 7 = 23.0314 \u2248 23.03\n\n      Hour 15: (24.29, 24.81, 22.62, 22.98, 22.12, 21.62, 21.09)\n          = (24.29+24.81+22.62+22.98+22.12+21.62+21.09) / 7 = 159.53 / 7 = 22.79 \u2248 22.79\n\n      Hour 16: (24.23, 24.85, 22.45, 23.03, 22.12, 21.66, 21.08)\n          = (24.23+24.85+22.45+23.03+22.12+21.66+21.08) / 7 = 159.42 / 7 = 22.7743 \u2248 22.77\n\n      Hour 17: (24.61, 24.97, 22.69, 23.52, 23.59, 21.82, 22.03)\n          = (24.61+24.97+22.69+23.52+23.59+21.82+22.03) / 7 = 163.23 / 7 = 23.3186 \u2248 23.32\n\n      Hour 18: (24.57, 25.21, 23.09, 23.86, 24.31, 22.61, 23.60)\n          = (24.57+25.21+23.09+23.86+24.31+22.61+23.60) / 7 = 167.25 / 7 = 23.8929 \u2248 23.89\n\n      Hour 19: (25.12, 25.49, 23.19, 24.04, 24.49, 23.01, 23.74)\n          = (25.12+25.49+23.19+24.04+24.49+23.01+23.74) / 7 = 169.08 / 7 = 24.1543 \u2248 24.15\n\n      Hour 20: (25.82, 25.66, 23.57, 24.26, 24.59, 24.22, 24.01)\n          = (25.82+25.66+23.57+24.26+24.59+24.22+24.01) / 7 = 172.13 / 7 = 24.59 \u2248 24.59\n\n      Hour 21: (26.01, 25.67, 23.70, 24.41, 24.70, 24.26, 24.20)\n          = (26.01+25.67+23.70+24.41+24.70+24.26+24.20) / 7 = 172.95 / 7 = 24.7071 \u2248 24.71\n\n      Hour 22: (25.42, 24.59, 22.87, 24.00, 24.60, 23.84, 23.69)\n          = (25.42+24.59+22.87+24.00+24.60+23.84+23.69) / 7 = 169.01 / 7 = 24.1443 \u2248 24.14\n\n      Hour 23: (24.50, 24.11, 22.01, 23.75, 23.58, 22.35, 23.03)\n          = (24.50+24.11+22.01+23.75+23.58+22.35+23.03) / 7 = 163.33 / 7 = 23.3329 \u2248 23.33\n\n 26.

However, note that the data on 2014-04-21 (Monday) was generally lower than the previous Tuesday (2014-04-15). But without more data, the 7-day average is a safe choice.\n\n 28. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple baseline. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models and include more data, but given the constraints (only 7 days of history and no exogenous variables) this is a reasonable approach.\n",
