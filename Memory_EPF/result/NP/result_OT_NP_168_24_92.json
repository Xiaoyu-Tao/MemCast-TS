        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (7 days * 24 hours). The last timestamp is 2014/10/13 23:00.\n We are to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/10/14 0:00 to 2014/10/14 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). \n Since we don't have the other variables, we must rely solely on the historical price data.\n\n Approach:\n 1. Check for missing values in the provided data. Looking at the data, it seems complete (168 entries, no gaps in the hourly sequence).\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the data is hourly and shows daily seasonality (pattern repeats every 24 hours) and weekly seasonality (weekdays vs weekend), we can use a time series model that captures these patterns.\n\n Since we are only allowed to use the provided data and we are an expert, we can use a simple but effective method: \n   - We can use the average of the same hour from the previous days (e.g., average of the last 7 days at 0:00 to forecast the next 0:00) but adjusted for the day of the week.\n\n However, note that the last day in the data is Monday (2014/10/13) and the next day is Tuesday (2014/10/14). \n We can look at the same hour from the previous Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the data: 2014/10/7 (which was a Tuesday).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days (e.g., 3 to 7 days) for the same hour.\n\n Steps for forecasting:\n   For each hour h in [0, 23] (for the next day 2014/10/14):\n      Let the forecast for hour h = average of the same hour h from the last 3 days (or 7 days) of the same day of the week? \n      But note: the last 3 days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. The next day is Tuesday. \n\n  We have:\n    Previous Tuesday: 2014/10/7 (7 days ago) \n    We don't have a Tuesday in the last 3 days.\n\n  So we can use:\n    Option 1: Use the average of the same hour from the last 7 days (which would include the same day of the week) but that would be only one Tuesday (7 days ago) and the rest are different days.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days and also to the same day of the week.\n\n  Given the complexity and without additional data, a simple method is to use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and then adjust by the difference between the same day of the week (Tuesday) and the average of the same hour of the previous week.\n\n  However, we only have one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days: from 2014/10/7 (Tuesday) to 2014/10/13 (Monday). So we have one full week.\n\n  We can do:\n    base = average of the same hour for the last 3 days (2014/10/11, 2014/10/12, 2014/10/13) at hour h.\n    Then, we can adjust by the weekly pattern: \n        Let last_week_same_hour = the value on 2014/10/7 at hour h.\n        Let avg_last_3_days_same_hour_last_week = average of the same hour for the 3 days before that Tuesday? But we don't have data before 2014/10/7.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the entire week? \n\n  Since we have only one week, we can see that the pattern on weekdays (Tue to Fri) is different from weekends (Sat, Sun). The next day is a weekday (Tuesday).\n\n  Proposed method:\n    For each hour h (0 to 23):\n        Let forecast = (average of the same hour h for the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday)) * (the value of the same hour h on the previous Tuesday (2014/10/7) / average of the same hour h for the entire week (from 2014/10/7 to 2014/10/13))\n\n  But note: we are trying to capture the weekly pattern. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n    forecast(h) = (value of h on last Tuesday) * (average of the last 3 days at h) / (average of the same hour h for the 3 days that are 7 days before the last 3 days? But we don't have that)\n\n  This might be too complex and we have limited data.\n\n  Given the constraints, a simpler approach is to use the average of the same hour from the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and then adjust by the typical Tuesday pattern relative to the average of the same days of the previous week.\n\n  However, we don't have multiple weeks. So we can do:\n\n    Let base = average of the same hour h for the last 3 days (2014/10/11, 2014/10/12, 2014/10/13) \n    Then, we note that the previous Tuesday (2014/10/7) at hour h was, say, x. The average of the same hour h for the entire week (7 days) is avg_week[h]. Then the ratio for Tuesday is x / avg_week[h]. But we don't have a full week of the same pattern? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week (Tuesday) from the previous week and then adjust by the recent trend? \n\n  Since we only have one Tuesday, we can use:\n\n    forecast(h) = (value of h on last Tuesday) * (average of the last 3 days at h) / (average of the same hour h for the 3 days that are exactly 7 days before the last 3 days? But the last 3 days are 2014/10/11, 2014/10/12, 2014/10/13. The same days 7 days before are 2014/10/4, 2014/10/5, 2014/10/6, which we don't have).\n\n  Therefore, we must rely on the available data.\n\n  Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days, but then we are including one of each day. But the next day is Tuesday, so we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days and then adjust by the ratio of the last Tuesday to the overall average? \n\n  However, without more data, we can use a simple moving average of the last 3 days for the same hour. This is a common naive approach for short-term forecasting.\n\n  Let's try with the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for each hour:\n\n   For hour 0: (2014/10/11 0:00, 2014/10/12 0:00, 2014/10/13 0:00) -> (31.40, 31.54, 31.03) -> average = (31.40+31.54+31.03)/3 = 31.3233\n\n   But note: the next day is Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday at 0:00 was 30.44. So our forecast for 0:00 is 31.32, which is higher than the previous Tuesday. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the previous week and the last 3 days? \n\n  Given the complexity and the fact that we are only provided with the price data, we will use a simple method: the average of the same hour for the last 3 days.\n\n  However, we note that the data shows a clear daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day. Also, the weekend pattern is different from weekdays. The next day is a weekday (Tuesday) and the last 3 days include two weekend days (Saturday, Sunday) and one weekday (Monday). So we might be introducing weekend patterns into a weekday.\n\n  To adjust for this, we can use:\n\n    forecast(h) = (value of h on the previous Tuesday (2014/10/7) + value of h on the last Monday (2014/10/13)) / 2\n\n  Why? Because Monday and Tuesday are consecutive weekdays. But we have only one Monday and one Tuesday.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and the previous Friday? but we have Monday and the previous Tuesday?).\n\n  We have the following weekdays in the last 7 days:\n    Tuesday (2014/10/7), Wednesday (2014/10/8), Thursday (2014/10/9), Friday (2014/10/10), Monday (2014/10/13) [note: Saturday and Sunday are weekends].\n\n  The next day is Tuesday. We can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays that are the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n  We can use the average of the same hour for the last Monday (2014/10/13) and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the previous Monday (2014/10/6, which we don't have) -> not possible.\n\n  Given the time and data constraints, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which includes two weekend days and one weekday) and then adjust by a factor to account for the weekday effect.\n\n  How to adjust? We can compute the average price for the entire last week (7 days) and the average price for the last 3 days. Then we can compute the average price for the previous Tuesday. \n\n  But without more data, we can do:\n\n    Let F(h) = (value of h on last Tuesday) * (average of the last 3 days at h) / (average of the same hour h for the entire week)\n\n  However, we don't have a baseline for the entire week? We do have the entire week.\n\n  Let:\n    total_week_avg = average of all 168 hours\n    total_3_days_avg = average of the last 72 hours (3 days)\n\n  But that is a global average, not per hour.\n\n  Alternatively, per hour:\n    Let A(h) = average of hour h over the entire week (7 days: 7 values for each hour h)\n    Let B(h) = average of hour h over the last 3 days (3 values for each hour h)\n\n    Then, the ratio R(h) = B(h) / A(h)  -> this captures how the recent 3 days at hour h compare to the typical week at hour h.\n\n    Then, we can use: \n        forecast(h) = (value of h on last Tuesday) * R(h)\n\n  Why? We are scaling the last Tuesday's value by the recent trend (relative to the weekly average for that hour).\n\n  Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n\n    1. Compute A(h): average of the 7 values at hour h (from 2014/10/7 to 2014/10/13).\n    2. Compute B(h): average of the 3 values at hour h for the last 3 days (2014/10/11, 2014/10/12, 2014/10/13).\n    3. R(h) = B(h) / A(h)\n    4. forecast(h) = (value at hour h on 2014/10/7) * R(h)\n\n  But note: if the recent 3 days are higher than the weekly average at hour h, then we scale up the previous Tuesday's value.\n\n  However, we must consider that the recent 3 days include two weekend days and one weekday, and the next day is a weekday. This might not be ideal.\n\n  Let's test for hour 0:\n    A(0): average of [30.44 (Tue), 29.18 (Wed), 30.11 (Thu), 29.43 (Fri), 31.40 (Sat), 31.54 (Sun), 31.03 (Mon)] \n        = (30.44+29.18+30.11+29.43+31.40+31.54+31.03)/7 = 30.3043\n    B(0): average of [31.40 (Sat), 31.54 (Sun), 31.03 (Mon)] = 31.3233\n    R(0) = 31.3233 / 30.3043 = 1.0336\n    Last Tuesday at 0:00: 30.44\n    Forecast(0) = 30.44 * 1.0336 = 31.46\n\n  Now, let's do hour 7:00 (a peak hour) on last Tuesday: 33.84\n    A(7): [33.84 (Tue), 34.20 (Wed), 34.85 (Thu), 34.23 (Fri), 32.55 (Sat), 31.14 (Sun), 35.61 (Mon)] \n        = (33.84+34.20+34.85+34.23+32.55+31.14+35.61)/7 = 33.7743\n    B(7): [32.55 (Sat), 31.14 (Sun), 35.61 (Mon)] = (32.55+31.14+35.61)/3 = 33.10\n    R(7) = 33.10 / 33.7743 = 0.9800\n    Forecast(7) = 33.84 * 0.9800 = 33.16\n\n  This method produces a forecast that is adjusted by the recent trend relative to the weekly average.\n\n  However, note that the recent 3 days include a Monday which was a high day? and the weekend days which are lower? So for hour 7:00, the recent 3 days average (33.10) is slightly below the weekly average (33.77), so we scale down the Tuesday value.\n\n  We must be cautious: the method might not be perfect, but it is a simple and explainable approach.\n\n  Let's try to see if it captures the daily pattern: the previous Tuesday had a peak at 7:00 of 33.84, and we forecast 33.16. The last Monday had 35.61 at 7:00, which is higher, but the weekend days were lower. So the average of the last 3 days at 33.10 is below the weekly average? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays? But we only have one weekday in the last 3 days (Monday). The previous weekdays are available: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday is the last one.\n\n  We can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays: Monday (2014/10/13), Friday (2014/10/10), Thursday (2014/10/9) -> but note: Friday and Monday are consecutive in the week, but Thursday is not consecutive to Monday.\n\n  We can use the last 3 weekdays: Monday, Friday, Thursday? That would be 3 days. Then we average the same hour for these 3 days.\n\n  Then, for each hour h:\n      forecast(h) = average of [Thursday (2014/10/9) at h, Friday (2014/10/10) at h, Monday (2014/10/13) at h]\n\n  Why skip the weekend? Because the next day is a weekday and we want to avoid weekend patterns.\n\n  The weekdays we have in the last 7 days that are not weekend: \n      Tuesday (2014/10/7) -> too old? \n      Wednesday (2014/10/8)\n      Thursday (2014/10/9)\n      Friday (2014/10/10)\n      Monday (2014/10/13)\n\n  We can take the last 3 weekdays: Monday, Friday, Thursday? But note: Monday is the most recent, then Friday, then Thursday. We can take the last 3: Monday, Friday, Thursday? That would be 3 days.\n\n  However, the sequence is: ... Thursday, Friday, (then weekend), Monday. So the last 3 weekdays are Monday, Friday, Thursday.\n\n  But note: the day of the week matters. We are forecasting a Tuesday. We can also include the previous Tuesday? But that is 7 days ago.\n\n  We can do: \n      forecast(h) = (Monday(h) + Friday(h) + Thursday(h)) / 3\n\n  Let's test for hour 0:\n      Thursday (2014/10/9 0:00): 30.11\n      Friday (2014/10/10 0:00): 29.43\n      Monday (2014/10/13 0:00): 31.03\n      average = (30.11+29.43+31.03)/3 = 30.19\n\n  For hour 7:00:\n      Thursday: 34.85, Friday: 34.23, Monday: 35.61 -> average = (34.85+34.23+35.61)/3 = 34.8967\n\n  This method gives 30.19 for 0:00 and 34.90 for 7:00.\n\n  Which method is better? The first method gave 31.46 for 0:00 and 33.16 for 7:00.\n\n  We must consider that the next day is a Tuesday and the previous Tuesday at 0:00 was 30.44 and at 7:00 was 33.84. The second method (using last 3 weekdays) gives 30.19 (close to 30.44) and 34.90 (which is higher than 33.84). \n\n  The second method might be more appropriate because it uses only weekdays and avoids the weekend effect.\n\n  However, note that the last Monday (2014/10/13) had a very high peak at 7:00 (35.61) which is higher than the Tuesday we are forecasting. So it might be pulling the average up.\n\n  We can try a weighted average: give more weight to the most recent days. For example, Monday (weight=3), Friday (weight=2), Thursday (weight=1). Then:\n      hour0: (3*31.03 + 2*29.43 + 1*30.11) / (3+2+1) = (93.09 + 58.86 + 30.11) /6 = 182.06/6 = 30.3433\n      hour7: (3*35.61 + 2*34.23 + 1*34.85) /6 = (106.83 + 68.46 + 34.85)/6 = 210.14/6 = 35.0233\n\n  This gives even more weight to Monday.\n\n  Given the trade-offs, and since we are an expert, we choose the simple average of the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) for the forecast.\n\n  Why not include the previous Tuesday? Because it is 7 days ago and might be less relevant. But we can try:\n\n      Including the previous Tuesday: then we have 4 weekdays. We can take the last 4 weekdays? But we are forecasting 24 points and we need consistency.\n\n  We can do: use the average of the same hour for the last 4 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday) and then we have 4 days? But then we are including Wednesday which is 6 days ago.\n\n  Given the time, we decide to use the average of the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) for each hour.\n\n  Steps:\n      For each hour h in 0..23:\n          forecast = (value on 2014/10/13 (Monday) at h + value on 2014/10/10 (Friday) at h + value on 2014/10/9 (Thursday) at h) / 3\n\n  We note that the dates in the data are:\n\n      Thursday: 2014/10/9\n      Friday: 2014/10/10\n      Monday: 2014/10/13\n\n  We have to extract the values for each hour from these three days.\n\n  Let's do it for all 24 hours.\n\n  We'll create a list for each hour:\n\n  Hour 0: (Thu: 30.11, Fri: 29.43, Mon: 31.03) -> (30.11+29.43+31.03)/3 = 90.57/3 = 30.19\n  Hour 1: (Thu: 29.54, Fri: 28.26, Mon: 30.95) -> (29.54+28.26+30.95)/3 = 88.75/3 = 29.5833 -> 29.58\n  Hour 2: (Thu: 29.22, Fri: 27.58, Mon: 30.72) -> (29.22+27.58+30.72)/3 = 87.52/3 = 29.1733 -> 29.17\n  Hour 3: (Thu: 29.31, Fri: 27.52, Mon: 30.83) -> (29.31+27.52+30.83)/3 = 87.66/3 = 29.22\n  Hour 4: (Thu: 30.09, Fri: 29.10, Mon: 31.21) -> (30.09+29.10+31.21)/3 = 90.40/3 = 30.1333 -> 30.13\n  Hour 5: (Thu: 31.09, Fri: 30.90, Mon: 32.13) -> (31.09+30.90+32.13)/3 = 94.12/3 = 31.3733 -> 31.37\n  Hour 6: (Thu: 33.13, Fri: 32.94, Mon: 33.88) -> (33.13+32.94+33.88)/3 = 99.95/3 = 33.3167 -> 33.32\n  Hour 7: (Thu: 34.85, Fri: 34.23, Mon: 35.61) -> (34.85+34.23+35.61)/3 = 104.69/3 = 34.8967 -> 34.90\n  Hour 8: (Thu: 35.09, Fri: 34.39, Mon: 35.96) -> (35.09+34.39+35.96)/3 = 105.44/3 = 35.1467 -> 35.15\n  Hour 9: (Thu: 34.85, Fri: 34.33, Mon: 35.78) -> (34.85+34.33+35.78)/3 = 104.96/3 = 34.9867 -> 34.99\n  Hour 10: (Thu: 34.47, Fri: 34.23, Mon: 36.11) -> (34.47+34.23+36.11)/3 = 104.81/3 = 34.9367 -> 34.94\n  Hour 11: (Thu: 33.88, Fri: 34.00, Mon: 35.89) -> (33.88+34.00+35.89)/3 = 103.77/3 = 34.59\n  Hour 12: (Thu: 33.29, Fri: 33.86, Mon: 35.26) -> (33.29+33.86+35.26)/3 = 102.41/3 = 34.1367 -> 34.14\n  Hour 13: (Thu: 33.05, Fri: 33.49, Mon: 34.90) -> (33.05+33.49+34.90)/3 = 101.44/3 = 33.8133 -> 33.81\n  Hour 14: (Thu: 33.13, Fri: 33.25, Mon: 34.58) -> (33.13+33.25+34.58)/3 = 100.96/3 = 33.6533 -> 33.65\n  Hour 15: (Thu: 33.50, Fri: 32.90, Mon: 34.42) -> (33.50+32.90+34.42)/3 = 100.82/3 = 33.6067 -> 33.61\n  Hour 16: (Thu: 33.81, Fri: 32.84, Mon: 34.05) -> (33.81+32.84+34.05)/3 = 100.70/3 = 33.5667 -> 33.57\n  Hour 17: (Thu: 34.78, Fri: 33.39, Mon: 35.22) -> (34.78+33.39+35.22)/3 = 103.39/3 = 34.4633 -> 34.46\n  Hour 18: (Thu: 34.92, Fri: 34.03, Mon: 35.98) -> (34.92+34.03+35.98)/3 = 104.93/3 = 34.9767 -> 34.98\n  Hour 19: (Thu: 34.70, Fri: 34.14, Mon: 35.64) -> (34.70+34.14+35.64)/3 = 104.48/3 = 34.8267 -> 34.83\n  Hour 20: (Thu: 34.00, Fri: 33.41, Mon: 34.56) -> (34.00+33.41+34.56)/3 = 101.97/3 = 33.99\n  Hour 21: (Thu: 33.49, Fri: 32.83, Mon: 33.39) -> (33.49+32.83+33.39)/3 = 99.71/3 = 33.2367 -> 33.24\n  Hour 22: (Thu: 32.03, Fri: 32.28, Mon: 32.53) -> (32.03+32.28+32.53)/3 = 96.84/3 = 32.28\n  Hour 23: (Thu: 30.83, Fri: 31.62, Mon: 31.93) -> (30.83+31.62+31.93)/3 = 94.38/3 = 31.46\n\n  So the forecast for 2014/10/14 0:00 is 30.19, 1:00 is 29.58, ... until 23:00 is 31.46.\n\n  We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n  We output the forecast for the next 24 hours in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n            2014/10/14 0:00 [forecast_value]\n            2014/10/14 1:00 [forecast_value]\n            ...\n            2014/10/14 23:00 [forecast_value]\n        </answer>\n\n  We note that the dates in the format: \"YYYY/MM/DD H:MM\", and the hour part uses 0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00.\n\n  Let's write the forecast:\n\n  2014/10/14 0:00 30.19\n  2014/10/14 1:00 29.58\n  2014/10/14 2:00 29.17\n  2014/10/14 3:00 29.22\n  2014/10/14 4:00 30.13\n  2014/10/14 5:00 31.37\n  2014/10/14 6:00 33.32\n  2014/10/14 7:00 34.90\n  2014/10/14 8:00 35.15\n  2014/10/14 9:00 34.99\n  2014/10/14 10:00 34.94\n  2014/10/14 11:00 34.59\n  2014/10/14 12:00 34.14\n  2014/10/14 13:00 33.81\n  2014/10/14 14:00 33.65\n  2014/10/14 15:00 33.61\n  2014/10/14 16:00 33.57\n  2014/10/14 17:00 34.46\n  2014/10/14 18:00 34.98\n  2014/10/14 19:00 34.83\n  2014/10/14 20:00 33.99\n  2014/10/14 21:00 33.24\n  2014/10/14 22:00 32.28\n  2014/10/14 23:00 31.46\n\n  This is our forecast.\n\n  Note: We are not using any complex model, but a simple average of the last three weekdays (Thursday, Friday, Monday) for the same hour. We assume that the next Tuesday will follow a similar pattern as the average of these three days.\n\n  We are aware that Monday is the most recent and might have a stronger influence, but we are taking a simple average.\n\n  If we had more data (like multiple weeks) we could do better, but with the given data this is a reasonable approach.\n\n  We output the forecast as above.\n",
