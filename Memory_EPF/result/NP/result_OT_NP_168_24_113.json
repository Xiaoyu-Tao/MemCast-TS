        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/3/3 0:00 to 2015/3/9 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/3/10 0:00 to 2015/3/10 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no additional features (like grid load or wind power) in the provided data, we must rely on time series forecasting methods.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but they are not provided. Therefore, we can only use the historical prices.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, there are 168 records (7 days * 24 hours) and no missing values in the provided OT column.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the data is hourly and shows daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns (as we have 7 days), we can use a model that captures these.\n\n 3. Since we are in a constrained environment without the ability to run complex models, we can use a simple but effective method: \n    - We can use the average of the same hour of the previous days (i.e., for hour 0:00, average the 0:00 of the last 7 days) and adjust for any trend or recent changes.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern: weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices than weekends. The last day in the data is Monday (2015/3/9). The next 24 hours are for Tuesday (2015/3/10). Therefore, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2015/3/3) and the most recent weekdays to form a baseline.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without additional features, we have to be simple.\n\n 6. Considering the requirement for a complete sequence and the need for a quick forecast, we can use the following method:\n\n    For each hour h (0 to 23) of the next day (2015/3/10):\n        Let the forecast = average of the same hour h from the last 7 days (i.e., from 2015/3/3 to 2015/3/9) for that hour.\n\n    However, note that the data on 2015/3/5 (Thursday) had a spike (e.g., 42.23 at 18:00) which might be an outlier. Using a simple average might be affected by that.\n\n 7. To handle outliers, we can use the median instead of the mean for the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights. For example, we can assign weights: \n    day t-1: weight 7, t-2: weight 6, ... t-7: weight 1. Then the forecast for hour h = (sum(price_hour_h on day i * weight_i)) / (sum of weights))\n\n 9. Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to act as an expert, I choose a method that is robust and simple: the median. The median is less sensitive to outliers.\n\n 10. Therefore, for each hour h in [0,23]:\n        Collect the 7 values for that hour from the 7 days (2015/3/3 to 2015/3/9).\n        Take the median of these 7 values as the forecast for hour h on 2015/3/10.\n\n 11. But note: the last day (2015/3/9) is a Monday and the day we are forecasting is a Tuesday. We might also consider using only the previous Tuesdays? However, we only have one Tuesday (2015/3/3) in the data. So using 7 days of the same hour is acceptable.\n\n 12. Let's do the median method.\n\n 13. However, we must also consider that the data might have a trend. But 7 days is a short period and the trend might be captured by the median? Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 3 days for the same hour? But the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values (which we don't have) and provide a forecast.\n\n 14. Given the simplicity and the requirement, I will use the median of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n 15. Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        hour0: [23.51 (3/3), 24.41 (3/4), 25.02 (3/5), 25.04 (3/6), 23.62 (3/7), 20.06 (3/8), 22.26 (3/9)] -> sort and take the middle (4th) value.\n\n 16. We'll compute for each hour.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the mean if the data is not too skewed. But the median is more robust to outliers.\n\n 18. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0: [20.06, 22.26, 23.51, 23.62, 24.41, 25.02, 25.04] -> sorted: [20.06, 22.26, 23.51, 23.62, 24.41, 25.02, 25.04] -> median is 23.62 (the 4th in 0-indexed 3rd is 23.51? Actually, for 7 elements: positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -> median is at index 3 -> 23.62? Let me check: \n        index0: 20.06\n        index1: 22.26\n        index2: 23.51\n        index3: 23.62 -> median\n        index4: 24.41\n        index5: 25.02\n        index6: 25.04\n    So median = 23.62\n\n    But wait: the median for an odd number n is the (n+1)/2 th term -> 4th term? Actually, the median is the (n+1)/2 th in order, which is the 4th smallest. So 23.62.\n\n 19. However, note that 2015/3/9 (Monday) had 22.26 at 0:00, and 2015/3/8 (Sunday) had 20.06, 2015/3/7 (Saturday) had 23.62. The median is robust.\n\n 20. We do the same for all 24 hours.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use a small program to compute, but since we are to write the answer, we can do it manually for 24 hours.\n\n 22. But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide the forecast. We can compute the median for each hour.\n\n 23. Let me compute the median for each hour:\n\n    We'll group by hour:\n\n    Hour 0: [23.51, 24.41, 25.02, 25.04, 23.62, 20.06, 22.26] -> sorted: [20.06, 22.26, 23.51, 23.62, 24.41, 25.02, 25.04] -> median = 23.62\n\n    Hour 1: [22.74, 23.73, 24.28, 24.38, 22.79, 18.21, 22.34] -> sorted: [18.21, 22.34, 22.74, 22.79, 23.73, 24.28, 24.38] -> median = 22.79\n\n    Hour 2: [22.36, 23.34, 24.02, 23.96, 22.00, 18.01, 22.40] -> sorted: [18.01, 22.00, 22.36, 22.40, 23.34, 23.96, 24.02] -> median = 22.40\n\n    Hour 3: [22.35, 23.56, 24.25, 23.94, 21.70, 17.97, 22.83] -> sorted: [17.97, 21.70, 22.35, 22.83, 23.56, 23.94, 24.25] -> median = 22.83\n\n    Hour 4: [23.19, 24.39, 24.97, 24.85, 21.39, 18.15, 23.76] -> sorted: [18.15, 21.39, 23.19, 23.76, 24.39, 24.85, 24.97] -> median = 23.76\n\n    Hour 5: [24.59, 25.70, 25.78, 25.57, 21.50, 18.43, 25.05] -> sorted: [18.43, 21.50, 24.59, 25.05, 25.57, 25.70, 25.78] -> median = 25.05\n\n    Hour 6: [26.36, 26.91, 26.98, 26.36, 21.78, 18.54, 26.14] -> sorted: [18.54, 21.78, 26.14, 26.36, 26.36, 26.91, 26.98] -> median = 26.36\n\n    Hour 7: [27.09, 29.03, 30.44, 27.72, 21.95, 19.18, 26.70] -> sorted: [19.18, 21.95, 26.70, 27.09, 27.72, 29.03, 30.44] -> median = 27.09\n\n    Hour 8: [27.30, 29.98, 36.32, 29.09, 22.25, 20.08, 27.40] -> sorted: [20.08, 22.25, 27.30, 27.40, 29.09, 29.98, 36.32] -> median = 27.40\n\n    Hour 9: [26.89, 28.90, 35.59, 28.82, 23.07, 21.42, 26.78] -> sorted: [21.42, 23.07, 26.78, 26.89, 28.82, 28.90, 35.59] -> median = 26.89\n\n    Hour 10: [26.66, 27.22, 30.18, 28.02, 23.31, 21.42, 26.45] -> sorted: [21.42, 23.31, 26.45, 26.66, 27.22, 28.02, 30.18] -> median = 26.66\n\n    Hour 11: [26.52, 26.97, 30.32, 27.33, 23.16, 21.86, 26.23] -> sorted: [21.86, 23.16, 26.23, 26.52, 26.97, 27.33, 30.32] -> median = 26.52\n\n    Hour 12: [26.18, 26.84, 28.52, 26.85, 22.50, 21.28, 25.95] -> sorted: [21.28, 22.50, 25.95, 26.18, 26.84, 26.85, 28.52] -> median = 26.18\n\n    Hour 13: [26.07, 26.81, 27.79, 26.57, 22.26, 21.09, 25.92] -> sorted: [21.09, 22.26, 25.92, 26.07, 26.57, 26.81, 27.79] -> median = 26.07\n\n    Hour 14: [26.33, 26.81, 28.69, 26.52, 22.08, 21.42, 25.95] -> sorted: [21.42, 22.08, 25.95, 26.33, 26.52, 26.81, 28.69] -> median = 26.33\n\n    Hour 15: [26.59, 26.65, 28.23, 26.39, 22.09, 21.46, 25.90] -> sorted: [21.46, 22.09, 25.90, 26.39, 26.59, 26.65, 28.23] -> median = 26.39\n\n    Hour 16: [26.66, 26.87, 28.51, 26.48, 22.73, 22.03, 25.95] -> sorted: [22.03, 22.73, 25.95, 26.48, 26.66, 26.87, 28.51] -> median = 26.48\n\n    Hour 17: [27.32, 28.17, 29.91, 27.31, 23.85, 24.46, 26.33] -> sorted: [23.85, 24.46, 26.33, 27.31, 27.32, 28.17, 29.91] -> median = 27.31\n\n    Hour 18: [28.21, 29.27, 42.23, 28.12, 24.42, 25.29, 27.40] -> sorted: [24.42, 25.29, 27.40, 28.12, 28.21, 29.27, 42.23] -> median = 28.12\n\n    Hour 19: [27.26, 28.06, 30.47, 26.99, 24.24, 25.30, 26.55] -> sorted: [24.24, 25.30, 26.55, 26.99, 27.26, 28.06, 30.47] -> median = 26.99\n\n    Hour 20: [26.69, 27.02, 27.24, 26.15, 23.26, 25.00, 26.07] -> sorted: [23.26, 25.00, 26.07, 26.15, 26.69, 27.02, 27.24] -> median = 26.15\n\n    Hour 21: [26.30, 26.63, 26.72, 25.80, 22.29, 24.55, 25.51] -> sorted: [22.29, 24.55, 25.51, 25.80, 26.30, 26.63, 26.72] -> median = 25.80\n\n    Hour 22: [26.04, 26.28, 26.18, 25.52, 22.12, 23.75, 24.80] -> sorted: [22.12, 23.75, 24.80, 25.52, 26.04, 26.18, 26.28] -> median = 25.52\n\n    Hour 23: [24.93, 25.23, 25.52, 25.05, 21.72, 22.69, 23.79] -> sorted: [21.72, 22.69, 23.79, 24.93, 25.05, 25.23, 25.52] -> median = 24.93\n\n 24.

We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple median method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like ARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning models) and incorporate the provided grid load and wind power forecasts. But without that data and without the ability to run complex models, we use this robust approach.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required XML-like format.\n",
