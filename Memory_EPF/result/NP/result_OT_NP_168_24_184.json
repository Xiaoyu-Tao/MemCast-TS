        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016/7/12 0:00 to 2016/7/18 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016/7/19 0:00 to 2016/7/19 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT). Without additional features (like grid load forecasts, wind power forecasts, etc.), we have to rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast the next 24 hours, we have a time series with hourly frequency. We can use a model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - Weekly seasonality (168 hours) might be considered, but we have only one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days (168 hours) and we are to forecast the next day.\n\n However, note that the data provided is exactly 7 days (from 2016/7/12 to 2016/7/18). We are to forecast the next day (2016/7/19).\n\n Given the limited data (only one week) and the requirement for a short-term forecast, we can use:\n   - A simple approach: Use the average of the same hour of the previous days (i.e., for hour 0:00, average of 0:00 of the last 7 days, and so on).\n   - Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n But note: The data shows a clear daily cycle. Also, we can see that weekdays and weekends might have different patterns. However, 2016/7/12 (Tuesday) to 2016/7/18 (Monday) includes both weekdays and a weekend (16th and 17th are Saturday and Sunday).\n\n Let's break down the days:\n   2016/7/12: Tuesday\n   2016/7/13: Wednesday\n   2016/7/14: Thursday\n   2016/7/15: Friday\n   2016/7/16: Saturday\n   2016/7/17: Sunday\n   2016/7/18: Monday\n\n The next day is 2016/7/19: Tuesday.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2016/7/12) and also consider the recent Monday (2016/7/18) and the same day of the week in the previous week? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the last few days, giving more weight to the same day of the week and the most recent days.\n\n However, due to the simplicity and the fact that we are only given the target variable, I propose:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) in the forecast day (Tuesday, 2016/7/19):\n      - Use the value from the same hour of the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2016/7/12) as a base.\n      - Adjust it with the most recent day (Monday, 2016/7/18) to capture the recent trend.\n\n But note: The data from 2016/7/12 (Tuesday) and 2016/7/18 (Monday) are not the same day of the week. We don't have a Monday in the previous week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include different days of the week.\n\n Considering the limited data and the fact that we are forecasting only one day ahead, we can use:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on 2016/7/19 = (value of hour h on 2016/7/12 [last Tuesday] + value of hour h on 2016/7/18 [yesterday, Monday]) / 2\n\n However, we note that the pattern on Monday (2016/7/18) is different from the previous Tuesday (2016/7/12). Also, the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices.\n\n Another idea: Use the average of the same hour for the last three days (which includes Saturday, Sunday, and Monday) and then adjust for the weekly pattern by adding the difference between the previous Tuesday and the average of the same three days in the previous week? But we don't have data before 2016/7/12.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use a simple method:\n\n   Since we have exactly one week of data, and we are forecasting the same day of the week (Tuesday) as the first day in our data, we can use the previous Tuesday (2016/7/12) as a base and then adjust by the overall trend observed in the last 24 hours.\n\n   Specifically, we can compute the average price of the last 24 hours (2016/7/18 0:00 to 2016/7/18 23:00) and the average price of the previous Tuesday (2016/7/12) for the same 24 hours. Then we adjust the base Tuesday by the ratio of the recent 24-hour average to the base Tuesday 24-hour average.\n\n   Let:\n        base_day = [prices for 2016/7/12 0:00 to 23:00]   (24 values)\n        recent_day = [prices for 2016/7/18 0:00 to 23:00] (24 values)\n\n        base_avg = average of base_day\n        recent_avg = average of recent_day\n\n        adjustment_factor = recent_avg / base_avg\n\n   Then forecast for hour h on 2016/7/19 = base_day[h] * adjustment_factor\n\n But note: This method assumes a multiplicative shift. Alternatively, we can use an additive shift: adjustment = recent_avg - base_avg, then forecast = base_day[h] + adjustment.\n\n However, looking at the data, the prices on 2016/7/18 (Monday) are generally higher than on 2016/7/12 (Tuesday). \n\n   base_avg (2016/7/12): \n        Let's compute: \n          (23.02+22.57+22.28+22.09+22.08+22.81+24.59+26.26+27.11+26.92+26.88+26.98+26.91+26.67+26.40+26.18+26.00+26.38+26.82+26.90+26.91+26.92+26.62+25.86) / 24\n        = 25.48\n\n   recent_avg (2016/7/18):\n        (24.82+23.63+23.02+22.72+22.94+23.79+26.21+27.69+28.87+28.67+27.93+27.78+27.43+27.34+27.19+26.97+26.46+27.02+28.02+27.99+28.19+28.04+27.35+25.90) / 24\n        = 26.40\n\n   So, the additive adjustment: 26.40 - 25.48 = 0.92\n   Multiplicative factor: 26.40 / 25.48 \u2248 1.036\n\n   We can try both and see which one makes sense? But without more data, we choose one.\n\n   Since the prices are not constant in their variability, multiplicative might be better? However, let's look at the pattern: the recent day is about 0.92 EUR/MWh higher on average.\n\n   We can use additive because the absolute increase seems consistent? But let's see the hourly differences:\n\n        Hour 0: 24.82 - 23.02 = 1.80\n        Hour 1: 23.63 - 22.57 = 1.06\n        ... \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median of the hourly differences? But that might be too complex.\n\n   Given the simplicity, I will use the additive adjustment of 0.92 for every hour.\n\n   So, forecast for 2016/7/19 h:00 = price of 2016/7/12 at h:00 + 0.92\n\n   But wait, is that reasonable? Let's check a few hours:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 + 0.92 = 23.94\n        Hour 1: 22.57 + 0.92 = 23.49\n        ...\n\n   However, note that the recent Monday (2016/7/18) had a higher average than the base Tuesday (2016/7/12). But we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we are using the base Tuesday pattern with a shift.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the multiplicative factor:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 * 1.036 = 23.85\n        Hour 1: 22.57 * 1.036 = 23.38\n\n   Which one is better? Without a validation set, it's hard. But note that the multiplicative factor might over-adjust the low prices and under-adjust the high prices? \n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and then adjust by the difference between the base Tuesday and the average of the same three days in the previous week? But we don't have the Saturday and Sunday of the previous week (we only have from Tuesday to Monday).\n\n   We can also consider: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and then adjust by the difference between the base Tuesday and the base Monday? But we don't have the base Monday (we have the previous Monday, which is 2016/7/11, but that's not in the data).\n\n   Given the constraints, I will use the additive adjustment of 0.92 to the base Tuesday.\n\n   However, note that the base Tuesday was 7 days ago and the market conditions might have changed. The recent Monday (yesterday) is more relevant. So, we can also consider:\n\n        forecast = (base_day[h] + recent_day[h]) / 2   [without any adjustment]\n\n   But that would be a simple average of two Tuesdays? Actually, base_day is Tuesday and recent_day is Monday. They are different days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and then add the difference between the base Tuesday and the average of the same hour for the three days in the previous week? But we don't have the previous Saturday and Sunday (because our data starts on Tuesday).\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 7-day window, I will use the additive adjustment method.\n\n   Let me compute the additive adjustment for each hour? Actually, we did a global additive adjustment. Alternatively, we can compute the average additive adjustment per hour? But that would require more data.\n\n   We can also use a weighted average:\n\n        forecast = 0.3 * base_day[h] + 0.7 * recent_day[h]\n\n   Why 0.7 for recent? Because the recent day is more relevant. But note: the recent day is Monday and we are forecasting Tuesday. The base day is Tuesday of last week, which is the same day of the week.\n\n   How about 0.5 and 0.5? \n\n   Let me trying to see the pattern: \n\n        On 2016/7/12 (Tuesday): \n            Hour 0: 23.02, Hour 1: 22.57, ... \n        On 2016/7/18 (Monday):\n            Hour 0: 24.82, Hour 1: 23.63, ...\n\n        The next Tuesday might be somewhere in between? \n\n   But note: the Monday was higher than the previous Tuesday. And we are forecasting a Tuesday. We don't know if the trend is increasing or not.\n\n   Without more data, I choose the additive adjustment of 0.92 (the average shift) to the base Tuesday.\n\n   However, let me check the average of the entire week? We have 7 days. The average of the entire week (168 hours) is:\n\n        We can compute: \n          base_week = [all 168 values] -> This is too time-consuming by hand. We can skip.\n\n   I will use the additive adjustment of 0.92 to the base Tuesday.\n\n   Therefore, the forecast for 2016/7/19:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 + 0.92 = 23.94\n        Hour 1: 22.57 + 0.92 = 23.49\n        Hour 2: 22.28 + 0.92 = 23.20\n        Hour 3: 22.09 + 0.92 = 23.01\n        Hour 4: 22.08 + 0.92 = 23.00\n        Hour 5: 22.81 + 0.92 = 23.73\n        Hour 6: 24.59 + 0.92 = 25.51\n        Hour 7: 26.26 + 0.92 = 27.18\n        Hour 8: 27.11 + 0.92 = 28.03\n        Hour 9: 26.92 + 0.92 = 27.84\n        Hour 10: 26.88 + 0.92 = 27.80\n        Hour 11: 26.98 + 0.92 = 27.90\n        Hour 12: 26.91 + 0.92 = 27.83\n        Hour 13: 26.67 + 0.92 = 27.59\n        Hour 14: 26.40 + 0.92 = 27.32\n        Hour 15: 26.18 + 0.92 = 27.10\n        Hour 16: 26.00 + 0.92 = 26.92\n        Hour 17: 26.38 + 0.92 = 27.30\n        Hour 18: 26.82 + 0.92 = 27.74\n        Hour 19: 26.90 + 0.92 = 27.82\n        Hour 20: 26.91 + 0.92 = 27.83\n        Hour 21: 26.92 + 0.92 = 27.84\n        Hour 22: 26.62 + 0.92 = 27.54\n        Hour 23: 25.86 + 0.92 = 26.78\n\n   But wait, the recent Monday (2016/7/18) had a peak at 28.87 at hour 8, and our forecast for hour 8 is 28.03, which is less than that. Is that reasonable? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the multiplicative adjustment:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 * 1.036 = 23.85\n        ... \n\n   But let me compute the multiplicative factor: 26.40 / 25.48 = 1.036 (approx)\n\n   Then:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 * 1.036 = 23.85\n        Hour 1: 22.57 * 1.036 = 23.38\n        Hour 2: 22.28 * 1.036 = 23.08\n        Hour 3: 22.09 * 1.036 = 22.88\n        Hour 4: 22.08 * 1.036 = 22.87\n        Hour 5: 22.81 * 1.036 = 23.63\n        Hour 6: 24.59 * 1.036 = 25.48\n        Hour 7: 26.26 * 1.036 = 27.21\n        Hour 8: 27.11 * 1.036 = 28.09\n        Hour 9: 26.92 * 1.036 = 27.89\n        Hour 10: 26.88 * 1.036 = 27.85\n        Hour 11: 26.98 * 1.036 = 27.95\n        Hour 12: 26.91 * 1.036 = 27.88\n        Hour 13: 26.67 * 1.036 = 27.63\n        Hour 14: 26.40 * 1.036 = 27.35\n        Hour 15: 26.18 * 1.036 = 27.12\n        Hour 16: 26.00 * 1.036 = 26.94\n        Hour 17: 26.38 * 1.036 = 27.33\n        Hour 18: 26.82 * 1.036 = 27.78\n        Hour 19: 26.90 * 1.036 = 27.87\n        Hour 20: 26.91 * 1.036 = 27.88\n        Hour 21: 26.92 * 1.036 = 27.89\n        Hour 22: 26.62 * 1.036 = 27.58\n        Hour 23: 25.86 * 1.036 = 26.79\n\n   The multiplicative method gives a slightly higher peak at hour 8 (28.09 vs 28.03). \n\n   Which one to choose? \n\n   We can also consider that the recent Monday had a higher peak (28.87) than the base Tuesday (27.11). The multiplicative method increases the base Tuesday peak by 3.6% to 27.11 * 1.036 = 28.09, which is still less than 28.87. The additive method only added 0.92 to 27.11 to get 28.03. \n\n   The recent Monday peak was 28.87, which is 1.76 higher than the base Tuesday peak (28.87 - 27.11) = 1.76). So the additive adjustment of 0.92 is less than 1.76. \n\n   But note: we are using the average shift of 0.92 for the entire day, not the peak hour shift.\n\n   Given the trade-off, I think the multiplicative method is more appropriate because the relative change might be more consistent. \n\n   Therefore, I will use the multiplicative adjustment.\n\n   However, note: the multiplicative factor was computed from the entire day averages. It might not capture the peak hour as well.\n\n   Another idea: use the recent Monday as the base for the forecast? But Monday and Tuesday are different. We don't have a strong reason to use Monday as the base for Tuesday.\n\n   Considering the day of the week, we stick with the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) and adjust by the overall trend (multiplicative).\n\n   So, the forecast the next 24 hours (2016/7/19 0:00 to 23:00) as:\n\n        date            OT\n 2016/7/19 0:00  23.85\n 2016/7/19 1:00  23.38\n 2016/7/19 2:00  23.08\n 2016/7/19 3:00  22.88\n 2016/7/19 4:00  22.87\n 2016/7/19 5:00  23.63\n 2016/7/19 6:00  25.48\n 2016/7/19 7:00  27.21\n 2016/7/19 8:00  28.09\n 2016/7/19 9:00  27.89\n2016/7/19 10:00  27.85\n2016/7/19 11:00  27.95\n2016/7/19 12:00  27.88\n2016/7/19 13:00  27.63\n2016/7/19 14:00  27.35\n2016/7/19 15:00  27.12\n2016/7/19 16:00  26.94\n2016/7/19 17:00  27.33\n2016/7/19 18:00  27.78\n2016/7/19 19:00  27.87\n2016/7/19 20:00  27.88\n2016/7/19 21:00  27.89\n2016/7/19 22:00  27.58\n2016/7/19 23:00  26.79\n\n   But note: the multiplicative factor was 1.036, but we rounded. Let me use a more precise factor: 26.40 / 25.48 = 1.0361067503924647\n\n   We can round the forecast to two decimal places.\n\n   However, the historical data has two decimal places, so we will round to two decimals.\n\n   Let me recalculate with the precise factor:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 * (26.40/25.48) = 23.02 * 1.0361067503924647 = 23.85 (rounded to two decimals: 23.02 * 1.0361067503924647 = 23.85)\n        How? 23.02 * 1.0361067503924647 = 23.02 * 1.0361067503924647 = \n          23.02 * 1.0361067503924647 = \n          = 23.02 * (1 + 0.0361067503924647) = 23.02 + 23.02*0.0361067503924647\n          23.02 * 0.0361067503924647 = 0.831 (approx) -> 23.02 + 0.831 = 23.851 -> 23.85\n\n   Similarly, we can compute each.\n\n   But note: the base_avg and recent_avg we computed might have rounding error? We used the exact numbers? \n\n   Let me recalc the base_avg for 2016/7/12:\n\n        Sum = 23.02+22.57+22.28+22.09+22.08+22.81+24.59+26.26+27.11+26.92+26.88+26.98+26.91+26.67+26.40+26.18+26.00+26.38+26.82+26.90+26.91+26.92+26.62+25.86\n        = 611.5\n        Average = 611.5 / 24 = 25.479166... -> 25.48 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n   The recent_avg for 2016/7/18:\n\n        Sum = 24.82+23.63+23.02+22.72+22.94+23.79+26.21+27.69+28.87+28.67+27.93+27.78+27.43+27.34+27.19+26.97+26.46+27.02+28.02+27.99+28.19+28.04+27.35+25.90\n        = 633.6\n        Average = 633.6 / 24 = 26.4\n\n   So the factor = 26.4 / 25.48 = 1.0361067503924647\n\n   We'll use this factor.\n\n   However, note that the base_avg we used (25.48) is rounded, but the actual sum is 611.5, so the exact average is 611.5/24 = 25.479166666666668. Similarly, recent_avg = 633.6/24 = 26.4 exactly? 633.6 is 633.6? Actually, the sum of the recent day: \n\n        Let me add again: \n          24.82+23.63=48.45, +23.02=71.47, +22.72=94.19, +22.94=117.13, +23.79=140.92, +26.21=167.13, +27.69=194.82, +28.87=223.69, +28.67=252.36, +27.93=280.29, +27.78=308.07, +27.43=335.5, +27.34=362.84, +27.19=390.03, +26.97=417, +26.46=443.46, +27.02=470.48, +28.02=498.5, +27.99=526.49, +28.19=554.68, +28.04=582.72, +27.35=610.07, +25.90=635.97\n\n        I get 635.97? But I wrote 633.6 earlier. I must have miscalculated.\n\n        Let me do it step by step:\n\n          24.82\n          +23.63 = 48.45\n          +23.02 = 71.47\n          +22.72 = 94.19\n          +22.94 = 117.13\n          +23.79 = 140.92\n          +26.21 = 167.13\n          +27.69 = 194.82\n          +28.87 = 223.69\n          +28.67 = 252.36\n          +27.93 = 280.29\n          +27.78 = 308.07\n          +27.43 = 335.5\n          +27.34 = 362.84\n          +27.19 = 390.03\n          +26.97 = 417.00\n          +26.46 = 443.46\n          +27.02 = 470.48\n          +28.02 = 498.50\n          +27.99 = 526.49\n          +28.19 = 554.68\n          +28.04 = 582.72\n          +27.35 = 610.07\n          +25.90 = 635.97\n\n        So the average = 635.97 / 24 = 26.49875 -> 26.50 (if rounded to two decimals)\n\n        And the base day (2016/7/12) sum: \n          23.02+22.57=45.59, +22.28=67.87, +22.09=89.96, +22.08=112.04, +22.81=134.85, +24.59=159.44, +26.26=185.70, +27.11=212.81, +26.92=239.73, +26.88=266.61, +26.98=293.59, +26.91=320.50, +26.67=347.17, +26.40=373.57, +26.18=399.75, +26.00=425.75, +26.38=452.13, +26.82=478.95, +26.90=505.85, +26.91=532.76, +26.92=559.68, +26.62=586.30, +25.86=612.16\n\n        So base_avg = 612.16 / 24 = 25.506666... -> 25.51 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n        Then factor = 26.50 / 25.51 = 1.0388083104664837\n\n   Now, we use this factor? \n\n   But note: the original data we were given had two decimals, so we should use the exact numbers.\n\n   However, to be consistent, we should use the exact sum and then the exact factor.\n\n   But the problem, we are to provide a forecast. The difference is small.\n\n   Let me use the exact factor: 26.49875 / 25.506666666666666 = 1.0389 (approx)\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid the average and use the ratio of the total sums? \n\n        total_recent = 635.97\n        total_base = 612.16\n        factor = total_recent / total_base = 635.97 / 612.16 \u2248 1.0389\n\n   Then:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 * (635.97/612.16) = 23.02 * 1.0389 = 23.91\n\n   But note: this factor is for the entire day, and we are applying it to each hour.\n\n   However, the multiplicative factor we are using the total sum is the same as the ratio of the averages? \n\n        (total_recent/24) / (total_base/24) = total_recent/total_base\n\n   So we can use factor = 635.97 / 612.16 = 1.0389 (rounded to 4 decimals)\n\n   Let me compute:\n\n        635.97 / 612.16 = 1.0389 (exact value: 635.97 / 612.16 \u2248 1.038899)\n\n   We'll use 1.0389.\n\n   Then:\n\n        Hour 0: 23.02 * 1.0389 = 23.91\n        Hour 1: 22.57 * 1.0389 = 23.44\n        ... \n\n   But this factor is very close to the previous factor (1.0389 vs 1.0361). The difference is because I miscalculated the sums.\n\n   Given the time, I will use the factor computed from the exact sums: 635.97 / 612.16 = 1.038899 (approx 1.0389)\n\n   We'll compute each hour:\n\n        h0: 23.02 * 1.0389 = 23.91\n        h1: 22.57 * 1.0389 = 23.44\n        h2: 22.28 * 1.0389 = 23.14\n        h3: 22.09 * 1.0389 = 22.95\n        h4: 22.08 * 1.0389 = 22.94\n        h5: 22.81 * 1.0389 = 23.69\n        h6: 24.59 * 1.0389 = 25.55\n        h7: 26.26 * 1.0389 = 27.28\n        h8: 27.11 * 1.0389 = 28.16\n        h9: 26.92 * 1.0389 = 27.97\n        h10: 26.88 * 1.0389 = 27.92\n        h11: 26.98 * 1.0389 = 28.03\n        h12: 26.91 * 1.0389 = 27.96\n        h13: 26.67 * 1.0389 = 27.70\n        h14: 26.40 * 1.0389 = 27.43\n        h15: 26.18 * 1.0389 = 27.20\n        h16: 26.00 * 1.0389 = 27.01\n        h17: 26.38 * 1.0389 = 27.40\n        h18: 26.82 * 1.0389 = 27.86\n        h19: 26.90 * 1.0389 = 27.95\n        h20: 26.91 * 1.0389 = 27.96\n        h21: 26.92 * 1.0389 = 27.97\n        h22: 26.62 * 1.0389 = 27.65\n        h23: 25.86 * 1.0389 = 26.86\n\n   We round to two decimals.\n\n   But note: the multiplication might yield more decimals, so we round to two.\n\n   This forecast seems reasonable.\n\n   However, note that the recent Monday had a peak at 28.87, and our forecast for the peak hour (h8) is 28.16, which is less than 28.87. But we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the base Tuesday had a peak of 27.11. We are scaling it by 3.89%, so it becomes 28.16. It is in line.\n\n   Therefore, we will use these values.\n\n   Format the answer as:\n\n        <answer>\n 2016/7/19 0:00 23.91\n 2016/7/19 1:00 23.44\n 2016/7/19 2:00 23.14\n 2016/7/19 3:00 22.95\n 2016/7/19 4:00 22.94\n 2016/7/19 5:00 23.69\n 2016/7/19 6:00 25.55\n 2016/7/19 7:00 27.28\n 2016/7/19 8:00 28.16\n 2016/7/19 9:00 27.97\n2016/7/19 10:00 27.92\n2016/7/19 11:00 28.03\n2016/7/19 12:00 27.96\n2016/7/19 13:00 27.70\n2016/7/19 14:00 27.43\n2016/7/19 15:00 27.20\n2016/7/19 16:00 27.01\n2016/7/19 17:00 27.40\n2016/7/19 18:00 27.86\n2016/7/19 19:00 27.95\n2016/7/19 20:00 27.96\n2016/7/19 21:00 27.97\n2016/7/19 22:00 27.65\n2016/7/19 23:00 26.86\n        </answer>\n\n   But note: the date format in the input was with a space between the date and time, and the time without a space (e.g., \"2016/7/12 0:00\"). We follow the same.\n\n   However, the input used a mix of spaces and alignments. We'll use the same format: \n        \"YYYY/M/D H:M\" with one space between date and time, and the time in \"H:M\" (without leading zero for hour).\n\n   But note: in the input, the hour is given as \"0:00\", \"1:00\", ... \"9:00\", \"10:00\", etc. So we use the same.\n\n   We have 24 lines.\n\n   Let me double-check the factor: 635.97 / 612.16 = 1.038899 (which is approximately 1.0389). The rounding in each multiplication might cause a small error, but we round to two decimals.\n\n   This is a simple method. In practice, more sophisticated methods (like ARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning) would be used, but given the constraints (only historical prices and no additional features) and the short history, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n   We output.\n",
