        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-10-21 00:00 to 2014-10-27 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2014-10-28 00:00 to 2014-10-28 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 consecutive hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we can use a time series method. Given the hourly data, we can consider:\n    - The data exhibits daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly patterns (but we only have 7 days, so weekly might be less prominent).\n    - We note that the prices have a clear daily cycle: lower at night, higher during the day.\n    - There was a significant drop on 2014-10-26 and 2014-10-27 (especially the night of 26th and early 27th) which might be due to a weekend effect.\n\n 3. Approach:\n    - We can use a simple seasonal naive method: using the same hour from the previous day as the forecast.\n    - However, note that the pattern on weekdays might differ from weekends. The last day (2014-10-27) is a Monday. The next day (2014-10-28) is a Tuesday.\n    - We can look at the previous Tuesday (2014-10-21) and also consider the recent Monday (2014-10-27) to adjust.\n\n 4. Considering the data:\n    - The week of 2014-10-21 (Tuesday) to 2014-10-27 (Monday) includes a weekend (25th and 26th are Saturday and Sunday) which had lower prices, especially on Sunday night.\n\n 5. Since we are only asked for the next 24 hours (a Tuesday), we can use the previous Tuesday (2014-10-21) as a base, but adjust for the recent trend.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last few days (excluding the weekend if necessary). However, the weekend pattern is different.\n\n 7. Given the simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables (like load or wind) in the provided data, we'll use:\n    - A weighted average of the same hour from:\n        - The same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday, 2014-10-21) and \n        - The same hour from the day before (Monday, 2014-10-27) to capture the most recent trend.\n\n    Weights: \n        - We give more weight to the most recent day (Monday) and less to the same day last week.\n\n    For example: \n        Forecast for 2014-10-28 00:00 = (0.7 * price of 2014-10-27 00:00) + (0.3 * price of 2014-10-21 00:00)\n\n 8. But note: the drop on Sunday and Monday might be due to the weekend, and Tuesday might return to a more typical pattern. However, the prices on Monday (2014-10-27) were already recovering from the Sunday drop.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last three weekdays (excluding the weekend) for which we have: \n        Tuesday (21st), Wednesday (22nd), Thursday (23rd), Friday (24th) and Monday (27th). \n    But note: Monday is not the same as Tuesday. We might use the last three Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n10. Given the limited data (only one week of history), we decide to use:\n        Forecast = (0.6 * yesterday (Monday) same hour) + (0.4 * same day last week (21st) same hour)\n\n    Why 0.6 and 0.4? Because the most recent day is more relevant, but note: the Monday (27th) had a very low night and then recovered. The Tuesday (21st) was a more typical Tuesday.\n\n11. However, we must also consider that the market might be returning to a more normal pattern after the weekend. The Monday (27th) was already a weekday and showed a pattern similar to the previous weekdays, but with a lower base? \n\n12. Let's compare the Monday (27th) with the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday (20th) in the data. So we have to rely on the Tuesday of last week and the recent Monday.\n\n13. We'll use the formula:\n      F(t) = 0.6 * D(t-24) + 0.4 * D(t-168)\n    where D(t-24) is the value 24 hours ago (i.e., same hour yesterday) and D(t-168) is the value 168 hours ago (same hour last week).\n\n14. But note: the data we have for yesterday (Monday) is from 2014-10-27 00:00 to 23:00, and for the same day last week (Tuesday) is 2014-10-21 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n15. We'll compute the forecast for each hour of 2014-10-28 (00:00 to 23:00) as:\n      hour 00:00: 0.6 * (2014-10-27 00:00) + 0.4 * (2014-10-21 00:00) = 0.6*3.48 + 0.4*28.72 = 2.088 + 11.488 = 13.576\n      hour 01:00: 0.6*2.32 + 0.4*27.68 = 1.392 + 11.072 = 12.464\n      ... and so on.\n\n16. However, we must be cautious: the Monday (27th) had extremely low prices at night (down to 2.00) which might be an anomaly? But the same day last week (Tuesday 21st) had prices around 28-29 at night. The forecasted night prices for Tuesday 28th would be a mix of these.\n\n17. Alternatively, we might consider that the extreme low on Monday night was due to the weekend effect and that Tuesday should be more like a normal weekday. Therefore, we might adjust the weights to put more weight on the same day last week for the night hours? But without more data, we stick to the same formula.\n\n18. We'll compute all 24 hours accordingly.\n\n19. Let's do the calculation:\n\n    Hour 00:00: 0.6 * 3.48 + 0.4 * 28.72 = 2.088 + 11.488 = 13.576 -> round to 2 decimals: 13.58\n    Hour 01:00: 0.6 * 2.32 + 0.4 * 27.68 = 1.392 + 11.072 = 12.464 -> 12.46\n    Hour 02:00: 0.6 * 2.00 + 0.4 * 26.95 = 1.2 + 10.78 = 11.98\n    Hour 03:00: 0.6 * 2.64 + 0.4 * 26.42 = 1.584 + 10.568 = 12.152 -> 12.15\n    Hour 04:00: 0.6 * 3.75 + 0.4 * 28.03 = 2.25 + 11.212 = 13.462 -> 13.46\n    Hour 05:00: 0.6 * 14.19 + 0.4 * 29.76 = 8.514 + 11.904 = 20.418 -> 20.42\n    Hour 06:00: 0.6 * 26.34 + 0.4 * 32.66 = 15.804 + 13.064 = 28.868 -> 28.87\n    Hour 07:00: 0.6 * 29.84 + 0.4 * 34.44 = 17.904 + 13.776 = 31.68\n    Hour 08:00: 0.6 * 30.15 + 0.4 * 34.59 = 18.09 + 13.836 = 31.926 -> 31.93\n    Hour 09:00: 0.6 * 29.48 + 0.4 * 33.89 = 17.688 + 13.556 = 31.244 -> 31.24\n    Hour 10:00: 0.6 * 29.26 + 0.4 * 33.78 = 17.556 + 13.512 = 31.068 -> 31.07\n    Hour 11:00: 0.6 * 29.08 + 0.4 * 33.40 = 17.448 + 13.36 = 30.808 -> 30.81\n    Hour 12:00: 0.6 * 28.59 + 0.4 * 32.76 = 17.154 + 13.104 = 30.258 -> 30.26\n    Hour 13:00: 0.6 * 29.04 + 0.4 * 32.24 = 17.424 + 12.896 = 30.32\n    Hour 14:00: 0.6 * 29.72 + 0.4 * 31.51 = 17.832 + 12.604 = 30.436 -> 30.44\n    Hour 15:00: 0.6 * 30.14 + 0.4 * 31.37 = 18.084 + 12.548 = 30.632 -> 30.63\n    Hour 16:00: 0.6 * 30.54 + 0.4 * 31.23 = 18.324 + 12.492 = 30.816 -> 30.82\n    Hour 17:00: 0.6 * 30.96 + 0.4 * 31.94 = 18.576 + 12.776 = 31.352 -> 31.35\n    Hour 18:00: 0.6 * 30.77 + 0.4 * 32.71 = 18.462 + 13.084 = 31.546 -> 31.55\n    Hour 19:00: 0.6 * 30.13 + 0.4 * 32.64 = 18.078 + 13.056 = 31.134 -> 31.13\n    Hour 20:00: 0.6 * 29.08 + 0.4 * 30.78 = 17.448 + 12.312 = 29.76\n    Hour 21:00: 0.6 * 27.64 + 0.4 * 29.89 = 16.584 + 11.956 = 28.54\n    Hour 22:00: 0.6 * 24.99 + 0.4 * 29.25 = 14.994 + 11.7 = 26.694 -> 26.69\n    Hour 23:00: 0.6 * 20.29 + 0.4 * 26.92 = 12.174 + 10.768 = 22.942 -> 22.94\n\n20. However, note that the Monday (27th) had a very low night and early morning, which might not be typical for a Tuesday. We might be under-forecasting the night and early morning because of the Monday's low. But without more data, we stick to this.\n\n21. Alternatively, we could use a seasonal ARIMA or exponential smoothing, but without the ability to run complex models, we use this simple weighted average.\n\n22. We output the forecast for 2014-10-28 00:00 to 2014-10-28 23:00.\n\nBut note: the problem says we have grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts in the dataset? However, the provided data only has date and OT (observed price). So we are only using the historical prices.\n\nWe'll output the 24 values in the required format.\n\nNote: The dates for the forecast are:\n  2014/10/28 0:00\n  2014/10/28 1:00\n  ...\n  2014/10/28 23:00\n\nWe must output exactly 24 lines.\n\nLet's write the forecasted values:\n\n2014/10/28 0:00: 13.58\n2014/10/28 1:00: 12.46\n2014/10/28 2:00: 11.98\n2014/10/28 3:00: 12.15\n2014/10/28 4:00: 13.46\n2014/10/28 5:00: 20.42\n2014/10/28 6:00: 28.87\n2014/10/28 7:00: 31.68\n2014/10/28 8:00: 31.93\n2014/10/28 9:00: 31.24\n2014/10/28 10:00: 31.07\n2014/10/28 11:00: 30.81\n2014/10/28 12:00: 30.26\n2014/10/28 13:00: 30.32\n2014/10/28 14:00: 30.44\n2014/10/28 15:00: 30.63\n2014/10/28 16:00: 30.82\n2014/10/28 17:00: 31.35\n2014/10/28 18:00: 31.55\n2014/10/28 19:00: 31.13\n2014/10/28 20:00: 29.76\n2014/10/28 21:00: 28.54\n2014/10/28 22:00: 26.69\n2014/10/28 23:00: 22.94\n\nWe output in the same format as the input, but for the next 24 hours.\n\nNote: The original data had two spaces for the hour part? We'll follow the same: \n  For single-digit hours: \"2014/10/28 0:00\" -> but the example had \"2014/10/21 0:00\" (with one space after the date and then the hour without leading zero). \n  However, in the given data, the hour part is written as \"0:00\", \"1:00\", ... \"9:00\", then \"10:00\", etc.\n\nWe'll write the date as \"2014/10/28\" and then the hour as \"0:00\", \"1:00\", ... \"23:00\".\n\nWe output in the answer block.\n",
