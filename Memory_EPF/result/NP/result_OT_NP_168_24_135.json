        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/8/4 0:00 to 2015/8/10 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/8/11 0:00 to 2015/8/11 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Therefore, we must base our forecast solely on the historical price data.\n\n Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need for 24-hour ahead forecast, we can consider the following:\n\n 1. The data exhibits daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, it's challenging to capture weekly patterns.\n\n 2. We note that the data has a clear pattern: low prices during the night and early morning, then a peak during the day, especially in the morning and evening.\n\n 3. We can use a simple approach: for each hour of the day, we can take the average of the same hour in the past 7 days (if available) to forecast the next day. But note that we have exactly 7 days of data (168 hours). So we can compute the average_hour(h) = (price_day1_h + price_day2_h + ... + price_day7_h) / 7\n\n However, we must be cautious: the last day (2015/8/10) is a Monday, and we are forecasting for Tuesday (2015/8/11). We have the same day of the week for the previous Tuesday? Actually, the data starts on Tuesday (2015/8/4) and ends on Monday (2015/8/10). So for the next day (2015/8/11) which is a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2015/8/4) and also the same day from the week? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour. Since we have 7 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n But note: the problem says \"some data may contain missing values\", but in the provided data there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n However, let's check: the data has 168 records (24*7) and we have 168 lines. So no missing values.\n\n Approach:\n\n For each hour in [0, 23] (for the next day, 2015/8/11):\n   Let h = hour (0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00)\n   We take the prices at the same hour for the past 7 days (from 2015/8/4 to 2015/8/10) and compute the average.\n\n But note: the data for 2015/8/4 (Tuesday) to 2015/8/10 (Monday) are 7 consecutive days.\n\n However, the pattern might be different for weekdays and weekends. We have:\n\n   Tuesday (2015/8/4), Wednesday (2015/8/5), Thursday (2015/8/6), Friday (2015/8/7), Saturday (2015/8/8), Sunday (2015/8/9), Monday (2015/8/10)\n\n The day we are forecasting is Tuesday (2015/8/11). So we can use the previous Tuesday (2015/8/4) and also the same weekday from the week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days. This is a simple and common approach.\n\n However, we note that weekends (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices. Therefore, we might want to use only the same day of the week? But we have only one Tuesday. So we can use:\n\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (including weekends) -> simple but might be influenced by weekend patterns.\n\n   Option 2: Use the same day of the week (i.e., the previous Tuesday) and then adjust with the overall trend? But we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n   Option 3: Use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays? But the last 3 weekdays are Friday, then Monday? And we are forecasting Tuesday.\n\n Given the limited data, we choose the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n Steps:\n\n   For hour 0:00: \n        values = [4.42 (Tue), 4.41 (Wed), 6.18 (Thu), 5.38 (Fri), 6.00 (Sat), 6.14 (Sun), 8.13 (Mon)]\n        average = (4.42+4.41+6.18+5.38+6.00+6.14+8.13)/7 = 5.80857\n\n   Similarly for each hour.\n\n But note: the day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday (2015/8/4) had lower prices than the Monday (2015/8/10). So the 7-day average might be higher than the typical Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the same day of the week? But we have only one same day.\n\n Given the constraints, we'll use the 7-day average.\n\n However, we can also that the prices on Monday (2015/8/10) were significantly higher than the previous days. This might be because it's a weekday and the start of the week. So for Tuesday, we might expect a pattern similar to Monday? But we don't have a strong basis.\n\n Since we are not provided with any other data (like load or wind) and we are an expert, we must rely on the time series.\n\n Another approach: use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week over the available history. But we only have one Tuesday. So we can use:\n\n   - The previous Tuesday (2015/8/4) and then adjust by the overall change from that Tuesday to the current week? \n\n However, without more data, we cannot compute a trend.\n\n Therefore, we will use the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (4.42, 4.41, 6.18, 5.38, 6.00, 6.14, 8.13) -> 5.8086\n   Hour 1: (3.82, 3.55, 5.23, 5.44, 5.64, 5.70, 7.90) -> 5.3257\n   Hour 2: (3.59, 3.38, 4.85, 4.97, 5.37, 5.51, 7.79) -> 5.0657\n   Hour 3: (3.63, 3.57, 4.64, 4.89, 5.06, 5.51, 7.65) -> 5.1357\n   Hour 4: (3.89, 3.69, 4.63, 4.92, 4.53, 5.20, 7.81) -> 4.9529\n   Hour 5: (4.83, 4.91, 5.25, 5.79, 4.49, 5.45, 7.94) -> 5.5229\n   Hour 6: (7.79, 8.02, 7.79, 7.93, 5.36, 5.58, 9.98) -> 7.4929\n   Hour 7: (10.15, 10.14, 9.76, 9.30, 5.77, 6.02, 11.45) -> 8.9414\n   Hour 8: (11.04, 11.17, 10.67, 10.11, 6.31, 6.78, 14.19) -> 10.0386\n   Hour 9: (11.87, 12.85, 11.45, 10.39, 7.23, 8.05, 15.09) -> 11.0043\n   Hour 10: (11.98, 12.86, 11.48, 10.46, 7.90, 8.60, 15.25) -> 11.2186\n   Hour 11: (11.91, 12.56, 11.19, 10.39, 7.80, 8.87, 15.00) -> 11.1029\n   Hour 12: (11.22, 12.11, 10.88, 10.15, 7.29, 8.60, 14.77) -> 10.7171\n   Hour 13: (10.69, 11.27, 10.52, 9.83, 6.82, 8.41, 14.08) -> 10.2314\n   Hour 14: (10.38, 10.94, 10.34, 9.44, 6.45, 8.26, 13.84) -> 9.95\n   Hour 15: (10.16, 10.69, 9.96, 9.16, 6.35, 8.18, 12.96) -> 9.6371\n   Hour 16: (9.95, 10.39, 9.82, 8.83, 6.34, 8.36, 11.45) -> 9.3057\n   Hour 17: (9.98, 10.41, 9.83, 8.88, 6.79, 9.34, 14.00) -> 9.8900\n   Hour 18: (9.92, 10.72, 9.82, 9.43, 6.99, 9.98, 13.92) -> 10.1114\n   Hour 19: (9.83, 10.62, 9.64, 9.37, 6.88, 10.12, 13.96) -> 10.06\n   Hour 20: (9.01, 10.22, 9.13, 8.88, 6.94, 10.27, 12.30) -> 9.5357\n   Hour 21: (9.23, 10.05, 9.04, 8.91, 7.07, 10.39, 11.44) -> 9.4471\n   Hour 22: (8.69, 9.53, 8.53, 8.72, 6.60, 10.05, 10.29) -> 8.9157\n   Hour 23: (7.61, 8.02, 6.91, 7.53, 6.08, 8.80, 8.64) -> 7.6557\n\n But note: the last day (Monday) was unusually high. We are forecasting a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was a low day. So the 7-day average might be a bit high for a Tuesday? But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n However, we can also that the prices on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) were lower than the weekdays, and Monday was high. So for Tuesday, we might expect a level between the previous Tuesday and the Monday? \n\n But we are not given any external information. So we output the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n Let's round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n Forecast for 2015/8/11:\n\n   0:00: 5.81\n   1:00: 5.33\n   2:00: 5.07\n   3:00: 5.14\n   4:00: 4.95\n   5:00: 5.52\n   6:00: 7.49\n   7:00: 8.94\n   8:00: 10.04\n   9:00: 11.00\n   10:00: 11.22\n   11:00: 11.10\n   12:00: 10.72\n   13:00: 10.23\n   14:00: 9.95\n   15:00: 9.64\n   16:00: 9.31\n   17:00: 9.89\n   18:00: 10.11\n   19:00: 10.06\n   20:00: 9.54\n   21:00: 9.45\n   22:00: 8.92\n   23:00: 7.66\n\n However, note that the problem says \"observed electricity prices\" and we are forecasting. We are not using any advanced model because we are only given the price history. \n\n But the problem also mentioned that the dataset contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are not provided with that data. So we cannot use them.\n\n Therefore, we output the above.\n\n But note: the problem says \"handle missing values carefully\", but we don't have any in the provided data.\n\n We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2015/8/11 0:00 5.81]\n        2015/8/11 1:00 5.33]\n        ... \n    </answer>\n\n However, the input format uses a space between the date and the time, and the price. Also, the input has two decimal places.\n\n Let's write the forecast for 2015/8/11 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n But note: the date in the input uses the format \"YYYY/M/D H:MM\", so for 2015/8/11, we write \"2015/8/11 0:00\", etc.\n\n We'll write:\n\n        2015/8/11 0:00 5.81\n        2015/8/11 1:00 5.33\n        2015/8/11 2:00 5.07\n        2015/8/11 3:00 5.14\n        2015/8/11 4:00 4.95\n        2015/8/11 5:00 5.52\n        2015/8/11 6:00 7.49\n        2015/8/11 7:00 8.94\n        2015/8/11 8:00 10.04\n        2015/8/11 9:00 11.00\n        2015/8/11 10:00 11.22\n        2015/8/11 11:00 11.10\n        2015/8/11 12:00 10.72\n        2015/8/11 13:00 10.23\n        2015/8/11 14:00 9.95\n        2015/8/11 15:00 9.64\n        2015/8/11 16:00 9.31\n        2015/8/11 17:00 9.89\n        2015/8/11 18:00 10.11\n        2015/8/11 19:00 10.06\n        2015/8/11 20:00 9.54\n        2015/8/11 21:00 9.45\n        2015/8/11 22:00 8.92\n        2015/8/11 23:00 7.66\n\n However, note: the input uses a space between the date-time and the price? Actually, the input has:\n\n   \"2015/8/4 0:00  4.42\"\n\n So we use two spaces? Or one? The example uses two spaces. But in the data, it's shown with two spaces. However, the alignment might be due to the tab. We can use one space.\n\n But the problem says: \"Please provide the complete forecast for the next 24 hours without omitting any values. You must give the full sequence \u2014 do not skip or summarize any values.\"\n\n And the format in the answer should be:\n\n        <answer>\n            2015/8/11 0:00 5.81\n            2015/8/11 1:00 5.33\n            ...\n        </answer>\n\n We'll use one space between the time and the price.\n\n However, the example input has:\n\n   \"2015/8/4 0:00  4.42\" -> two spaces between the time and the price? Actually, in the text it's shown with two spaces, but it might be due to formatting. We'll use one space.\n\n But to be safe, we can use the same as the input: the first column is the date and time as a string, then the price. The input uses a space between the time and the price. And the time is written as \"0:00\" (without leading zero for hour). We'll do the same.\n\n We'll write:\n\n        [date] [hour] [price]\n\n Example: \"2015/8/11 0:00 5.81\"\n\n But note: the hour in the input is written without leading zeros for the hour? Yes, it's \"0:00\", not \"00:00\". So we write the hour as 0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00.\n\n Let's output accordingly.\n",
