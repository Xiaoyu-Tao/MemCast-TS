        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014-12-30 00:00 to 2015-01-05 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2015-01-06 00:00 to 2015-01-06 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points). But we are told that some data may contain missing values. In this case, we don't see any missing in the given data.\n\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we can use a time series method. Given the hourly data and the strong daily seasonality (and possibly weekly), we can use a seasonal ARIMA model or exponential smoothing. However, without the ability to run code, we must rely on pattern recognition and typical behavior.\n\n 3. Observing the data:\n    - The prices show a clear pattern: lower during the night and higher during the day.\n    - There is a noticeable increase in prices on 2015-01-05 (Monday) compared to the previous days (which were holidays: New Year's Eve and New Year's Day). This suggests a weekly pattern (higher on weekdays, lower on weekends).\n\n 4. We note that the next 24 hours are for 2015-01-06, which is a Tuesday (after Monday). We expect the pattern to be similar to the previous weekday (Monday, 2015-01-05) but we must account for the typical daily cycle.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We can use the average of the same hours of the previous days (especially the most recent weekday) to form a baseline.\n    - However, the price on 2015-01-05 was particularly high (reaching 48.72 \u20ac/MWh) compared to the weekend. We must consider if this spike is an anomaly or the start of a high-price period.\n\n 6. Considering the limited data and the requirement for a quick response, we can use a simple method:\n    - Calculate the average of the same hour for the last 7 days (if we had a full week) but note that the last 7 days include holidays. Alternatively, we can use the last Monday (2015-01-05) as a reference and adjust by the typical daily profile.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the following:\n    - Let the forecast for 2015-01-06 00:00 be the average of the last 3 same hours (00:00) but adjusted for the weekly trend. However, without more data, we can use the following heuristic:\n\n 8. Since the data shows a clear daily cycle and a weekly pattern, we can compute:\n    - The average daily profile for weekdays (if we had more weekdays) but we only have one full weekday (2015-01-05) and the rest are holidays.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without running a model, we can do:\n    - Use the previous day (2015-01-05) as a base and adjust by the difference between the previous Monday and the day before that (Sunday) to capture the weekly increase.\n\n 10. However, note that the data for 2015-01-04 (Sunday) and 2015-01-05 (Monday) are available. We can compute the ratio (or additive difference) between Monday and Sunday for each hour and then apply that to the next day (Tuesday) relative to Monday? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a naive approach: \n      - The price for 2015-01-06 might be similar to 2015-01-05, but with a slight decrease because the spike on Monday might be due to the end of the holiday. However, without more context, we can assume that the pattern of 2015-01-05 is a return to normal and that Tuesday might be similar.\n\n 12. But note: the data on 2015-01-05 shows a very high peak in the evening (48.72 at 17:00). We should check if that is typical. Since we don't have more data, we can only rely on the given 7 days.\n\n 13. Considering the above, we will use:\n      - The average of the same hour for the last two weekdays? But we only have one weekday (Monday). The days before that were holidays (Saturday, Sunday) and New Year's Day (Thursday) and Friday? Actually, 2015-01-02 was Friday, but it was still a holiday period? The prices on 2015-01-02 were lower than Monday.\n\n 14. We decide to use the following:\n      - For each hour, we take the price of the same hour on the previous day (2015-01-05) and adjust it by the average change from the previous day to the current day in the past week.\n\n 15. However, we don't have a Tuesday in the past week. So we can do:\n\n      Let F(t) = forecast for hour t on 2015-01-06.\n      Let P(t-24) = price at the same hour on 2015-01-05.\n      Let P(t-48) = price at the same hour on 2015-01-04.\n\n      We can compute the change from 2015-01-04 to 2015-01-05: Delta = P(t-24) - P(t-48)\n\n      Then, we can assume that the change from 2015-01-05 to 2015-01-06 might be similar to the change from 2015-01-04 to 2015-01-05? But that might not hold.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour. Since we have 7 days, we can take the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which includes Sunday, Monday, and Saturday?).\n\n 17. We note the days:\n      - 2015-01-03 (Saturday): prices were moderate (max around 29.46)\n      - 2015-01-04 (Sunday): prices were a bit higher than Saturday (max 29.86)\n      - 2015-01-05 (Monday): prices were significantly higher (max 48.72)\n\n 18. Since 2015-01-06 is a Tuesday, we expect it to be a working day. We can assume that the prices will be similar to Monday but with a slight decrease because the extreme spike might not repeat. However, without more data, we can use Monday's prices as a base and apply a small reduction.\n\n 19. We can also look at the pattern of the week: \n        Monday: high\n        Tuesday: might be similar to Monday? \n\n 20. Given the above, we decide to forecast by taking the price of the same hour on the previous day (Monday) and multiply by a factor of 0.98 (a 2% reduction) to account for the possibility of a slight decrease. This is a heuristic.\n\n 21. However, note that the prices on Monday were very high in the evening. It might be that the spike was due to a temporary situation. We don't have the grid load or wind power forecasts, so we cannot account for that.\n\n 22. Considering the simplicity and the requirement to provide a forecast, we will use:\n        F(t) = P(t-24) * 0.98\n\n 23. But let's check the data: \n        On 2015-01-05 00:00: 28.54 -> forecast for 2015-01-06 00:00: 28.54 * 0.98 = 27.97\n        Similarly, for 17:00: 48.72 * 0.98 = 47.75\n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) to smooth out the spike. But the spike on Monday might be a real event and should not be averaged out.\n\n 25. We decide to use the previous day (Monday) as the base and adjust by the average change from Sunday to Monday for each hour? \n\n    Let D(t) = P(t-24) - P(t-48)   [change from Sunday to Monday for hour t]\n    Then F(t) = P(t-24) + D(t)   ??? That would be doubling the change? \n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use: \n        F(t) = P(t-24) + [ (P(t-24) - P(t-48)) * 0.5 ] \n    meaning we expect half the change to continue? But that might be too high.\n\n 27. Given the complexity and the fact that we are not running a model, we choose a simple method: \n        Use the same as the same hour of the previous day (Monday) but with a 2% reduction.\n\n 28. We note that the prices on Monday were significantly higher than Sunday, and we don't have a reason to expect a further increase. So a slight reduction is safe.\n\n 29. Therefore, we will forecast each hour of 2015-01-06 by taking the same hour of 2015-01-05 and multiplying by 0.98.\n\n 30. We compute:\n\n        Hour 00:00: 28.54 * 0.98 = 27.97\n        Hour 01:00: 28.43 * 0.98 = 27.86\n        Hour 02:00: 28.41 * 0.98 = 27.84\n        Hour 03:00: 28.37 * 0.98 = 27.80\n        Hour 04:00: 28.50 * 0.98 = 27.93\n        Hour 05:00: 29.32 * 0.98 = 28.73\n        Hour 06:00: 30.48 * 0.98 = 29.87\n        Hour 07:00: 32.96 * 0.98 = 32.30\n        Hour 08:00: 38.45 * 0.98 = 37.68\n        Hour 09:00: 40.19 * 0.98 = 39.39\n        Hour 10:00: 39.61 * 0.98 = 38.82\n        Hour 11:00: 39.64 * 0.98 = 38.85\n        Hour 12:00: 39.21 * 0.98 = 38.43\n        Hour 13:00: 39.72 * 0.98 = 38.93\n        Hour 14:00: 40.72 * 0.98 = 39.91\n        Hour 15:00: 42.11 * 0.98 = 41.27\n        Hour 16:00: 46.05 * 0.98 = 45.13\n        Hour 17:00: 48.72 * 0.98 = 47.75\n        Hour 18:00: 48.75 * 0.98 = 47.78\n        Hour 19:00: 46.02 * 0.98 = 45.10\n        Hour 20:00: 37.17 * 0.98 = 36.43\n        Hour 21:00: 34.35 * 0.98 = 33.66\n        Hour 22:00: 31.83 * 0.98 = 31.19\n        Hour 23:00: 29.73 * 0.98 = 29.14\n\n 31. However, note that the reduction of 2% is arbitrary. We might consider a different adjustment for the peak hours? But for simplicity, we apply uniformly.\n\n 32. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for each hour. Let's try for a few hours:\n\n      For 00:00:\n        Saturday (2015-01-03 00:00): 24.61\n        Sunday (2015-01-04 00:00): 27.42\n        Monday (2015-01-05 00:00): 28.54\n        Average = (24.61+27.42+28.54)/3 = 26.86\n\n      For 17:00:\n        Saturday: 29.40\n        Sunday: 29.68\n        Monday: 48.72\n        Average = (29.40+29.68+48.72)/3 = 35.93\n\n      This average for 17:00 is 35.93, which is much lower than Monday's 48.72. But we expect Tuesday to be a weekday and likely to have high demand. So the average might be too low.\n\n 33. We can use a weighted average: give Monday a higher weight? For example, 0.5 for Monday, 0.3 for Sunday, 0.2 for Saturday.\n\n      For 00:00: 0.2*24.61 + 0.3*27.42 + 0.5*28.54 = 27.35\n      For 17:00: 0.2*29.40 + 0.3*29.68 + 0.5*48.72 = 38.00\n\n 34. This weighted average for 17:00 is 38.00, which is still lower than Monday. But we don't know if the spike will repeat. Without more data, we stick to the previous method.\n\n 35. Considering the above, we decide to use the simple 2% reduction from Monday's prices.\n\n 36. We output the forecast for the next 24 hours (2015-01-06 00:00 to 2015-01-06 23:00) as computed in step 30.\n\n 37. Format the answer as required.\n\n Note: This is a heuristic approach. In practice, one would use a more sophisticated model and include the grid load and wind power forecasts if available. But the problem only provides the historical prices.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n",
