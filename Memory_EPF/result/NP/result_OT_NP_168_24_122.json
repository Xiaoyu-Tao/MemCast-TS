        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (7 days * 24 hours). We are to forecast the next 24 hours (one day ahead).\n Since the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only given the historical prices, we must rely solely on the time series of observed prices (OT) for forecasting.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values in the provided data. The data provided seems complete (168 entries for 168 hours). \n    However, we note that the data starts at 2015/5/5 0:00 and ends at 2015/5/11 23:00 (which is 7 full days).\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/5/12 0:00 to 2015/5/12 23:00.\n\n 3. Since we are only given the price and no exogenous variables (like load or wind) for the forecast period, we must use a univariate time series method.\n\n 4. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours). Also, we note that the data shows intra-day patterns (e.g., prices are lower at night and higher during the day).\n\n 5. We can use a seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. However, without the ability to fit a model in real-time, we must rely on a simple but effective method.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, one straightforward approach is to use the average of the same hour from the last 7 days (i.e., a seasonal naive method with a period of 24). But note that the data includes weekdays and weekends, and the last day (2015/5/11) is a Monday? (We don't have the day of the week, but we can check the pattern.)\n\n    However, looking at the data: \n        - The last day (2015/5/11) is a Monday? (We can check: 2015/5/5 is Tuesday, 5/6 Wednesday, ... 5/11 is Monday? Actually, 5/5 is Tuesday, so 5/11 is the next Monday.)\n\n    But note: the pattern on weekends (5/9 and 5/10) is different (lower prices). The day we are forecasting (5/12) is a Tuesday.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week. However, we only have one Tuesday in the data (5/5) and then we are forecasting the next Tuesday (5/12). But we have 7 days of data, so we can take the same hour from the same day of the week? Actually, we have:\n\n        Tuesday: 5/5 (day 0 to 23)\n        Wednesday: 5/6\n        Thursday: 5/7\n        Friday: 5/8\n        Saturday: 5/9\n        Sunday: 5/10\n        Monday: 5/11\n\n    We are forecasting Tuesday: 5/12.\n\n    So we can take the average of the same hour from the previous Tuesday (5/5) and also consider the recent Monday (5/11) and the same day last week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n 8. Given the limited data (only one week of history for the same day of the week), we might use a combination of the same hour from the last 7 days and then adjust by the overall trend? However, we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But note that 5/12 is a Tuesday, so we can take the same hour from the last Tuesday (5/5) and also the same hour from the Monday (5/11) and Wednesday (5/6) to account for the adjacent days? But that might not be robust.\n\n 10. Given the simplicity required, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out some noise.\n\n    For hour 0: average of [2015/5/5 0:00, 2015/5/6 0:00, ... 2015/5/11 0:00]\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n 11. However, note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns. Since 5/12 is a Tuesday, we might not want to include the weekend. So we can use:\n\n        Only the weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the same day of the week and less to others? But we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, we will use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This is a simple and common baseline.\n\n    Let H0, H1, ... H23 be the 24 hours of the day.\n\n    For hour H_i in the forecast (i from 0 to 23), we compute:\n\n        forecast_i = (price_{i, day1} + price_{i, day2} + ... + price_{i, day7}) / 7\n\n    where day1 is 7 days before the forecast day (i.e., 2015/5/5), day2 is 6 days before (2015/5/6), ... day7 is the day before (2015/5/11).\n\n 14. But note: the data we have is from 2015/5/5 to 2015/5/11 (both inclusive). So for hour 0:00, we have:\n\n        2015/5/5 0:00: 24.84\n        2015/5/6 0:00: 22.61\n        2015/5/7 0:00: 20.78\n        2015/5/8 0:00: 22.04\n        2015/5/9 0:00: 21.53\n        2015/5/10 0:00: 17.96\n        2015/5/11 0:00: 22.04\n\n        average = (24.84 + 22.61 + 20.78 + 22.04 + 21.53 + 17.96 + 22.04) / 7 = 21.5428... -> round to 2 decimals: 21.54\n\n 15. We do this for each hour.\n\n 16. However, note that the weekend (5/9 and 5/10) have lower prices. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, which is a weekday, we might get a downward bias by including the weekend. But without more data, we stick to the 7-day average.\n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (5/5) as the forecast? That would be a naive seasonal (weekly) forecast. But that might be too volatile.\n\n 18. Considering the trade-off, we choose the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n 19. Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (from 0:00 to 23:00 on 2015/5/12) using the 7-day average.\n\n 20. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the corresponding hour from the 7 days.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    We have 168 data points. We can group by the hour of the day (0 to 23) and then for each hour, take the 7 values and average.\n\n    The data is in chronological order. The first 24 hours (index 0-23) are for 2015/5/5 (Tuesday)\n    next 24 (24-47) for 5/6 (Wednesday), ... last 24 (144-167) for 5/11 (Monday).\n\n    For hour 0: \n        indices: 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144\n    For hour 1:\n        indices: 1, 25, 49, 73, 97, 121, 145\n    ... and so on.\n\n 21. We'll compute the average for each hour.\n\n 22. But note: the problem says to handle missing values. We don't have any in the provided data, so we can proceed.\n\n 23. Let's calculate:\n\n    Hour 0: [24.84, 22.61, 20.78, 22.04, 21.53, 17.96, 22.04] -> \n        sum = 24.84+22.61+20.78+22.04+21.53+17.96+22.04 = 151.8\n        avg = 151.8 / 7 = 21.6857 -> 21.69 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n    Hour 1: [24.08, 21.92, 18.32, 21.56, 21.02, 13.93, 20.33] -> \n        sum = 24.08+21.92+18.32+21.56+21.02+13.93+20.33 = 141.16\n        avg = 141.16 / 7 = 20.1657 -> 20.17\n\n    Hour 2: [24.06, 20.65, 16.74, 21.45, 19.57, 14.85, 19.46] -> \n        sum = 24.06+20.65+16.74+21.45+19.57+14.85+19.46 = 136.78\n        avg = 136.78 / 7 = 19.54\n\n    Hour 3: [23.97, 19.94, 16.39, 21.62, 17.39, 14.50, 19.36] -> \n        sum = 23.97+19.94+16.39+21.62+17.39+14.50+19.36 = 133.17\n        avg = 133.17 / 7 = 19.024 -> 19.02\n\n    Hour 4: [23.93, 20.13, 17.81, 22.02, 17.53, 12.79, 19.75] -> \n        sum = 23.93+20.13+17.81+22.02+17.53+12.79+19.75 = 133.96\n        avg = 133.96 / 7 = 19.137 -> 19.14\n\n    Hour 5: [24.39, 23.07, 21.04, 23.10, 17.21, 10.84, 21.43] -> \n        sum = 24.39+23.07+21.04+23.10+17.21+10.84+21.43 = 141.08\n        avg = 141.08 / 7 = 20.154 -> 20.15\n\n    Hour 6: [25.57, 24.75, 23.79, 25.28, 17.92, 12.00, 23.79] -> \n        sum = 25.57+24.75+23.79+25.28+17.92+12.00+23.79 = 153.1\n        avg = 153.1 / 7 = 21.871 -> 21.87\n\n    Hour 7: [29.07, 26.18, 26.08, 26.79, 19.62, 14.71, 26.29] -> \n        sum = 29.07+26.18+26.08+26.79+19.62+14.71+26.29 = 168.74\n        avg = 168.74 / 7 = 24.1057 -> 24.11\n\n    Hour 8: [29.95, 27.07, 27.25, 27.89, 21.27, 17.91, 26.61] -> \n        sum = 29.95+27.07+27.25+27.89+21.27+17.91+26.61 = 177.95\n        avg = 177.95 / 7 = 25.4214 -> 25.42\n\n    Hour 9: [28.77, 26.97, 26.79, 27.69, 21.31, 19.26, 26.39] -> \n        sum = 28.77+26.97+26.79+27.69+21.31+19.26+26.39 = 177.18\n        avg = 177.18 / 7 = 25.3114 -> 25.31\n\n    Hour 10: [28.16, 26.63, 25.58, 27.10, 20.74, 20.33, 26.08] -> \n        sum = 28.16+26.63+25.58+27.10+20.74+20.33+26.08 = 174.62\n        avg = 174.62 / 7 = 24.9457 -> 24.95\n\n    Hour 11: [27.66, 26.25, 25.16, 26.71, 20.45, 20.33, 25.68] -> \n        sum = 27.66+26.25+25.16+26.71+20.45+20.33+25.68 = 172.24\n        avg = 172.24 / 7 = 24.6057 -> 24.61\n\n    Hour 12: [27.10, 24.87, 24.57, 26.37, 20.02, 20.10, 24.72] -> \n        sum = 27.10+24.87+24.57+26.37+20.02+20.10+24.72 = 167.75\n        avg = 167.75 / 7 = 23.964 -> 23.96\n\n    Hour 13: [26.78, 24.61, 24.44, 25.57, 19.63, 19.72, 23.91] -> \n        sum = 26.78+24.61+24.44+25.57+19.63+19.72+23.91 = 164.66\n        avg = 164.66 / 7 = 23.5228 -> 23.52\n\n    Hour 14: [25.34, 24.47, 23.91, 24.27, 19.87, 19.62, 23.57] -> \n        sum = 25.34+24.47+23.91+24.27+19.87+19.62+23.57 = 161.05\n        avg = 161.05 / 7 = 23.007 -> 23.01\n\n    Hour 15: [24.98, 24.29, 24.09, 24.01, 19.99, 19.16, 23.22] -> \n        sum = 24.98+24.29+24.09+24.01+19.99+19.16+23.22 = 159.74\n        avg = 159.74 / 7 = 22.82\n\n    Hour 16: [24.94, 24.23, 24.25, 24.06, 20.67, 19.71, 22.99] -> \n        sum = 24.94+24.23+24.25+24.06+20.67+19.71+22.99 = 160.85\n        avg = 160.85 / 7 = 22.9786 -> 22.98\n\n    Hour 17: [25.04, 24.60, 24.65, 24.45, 21.11, 20.98, 22.97] -> \n        sum = 25.04+24.60+24.65+24.45+21.11+20.98+22.97 = 163.8\n        avg = 163.8 / 7 = 23.4\n\n    Hour 18: [25.47, 25.47, 24.81, 25.00, 21.23, 21.71, 23.22] -> \n        Note: The second value is 25.47?
