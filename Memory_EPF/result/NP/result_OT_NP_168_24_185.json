        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/7/19 0:00 to 2016/7/25 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2016/7/26 0:00 to 2016/7/26 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we are to handle missing values, we note that the provided data does not have any missing values in the OT (observed price) column. Therefore, we can proceed with forecasting.\n\n However, the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are not provided with that data for the future. Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data (OT) for forecasting.\n\n Given the constraints, we are to forecast based on the given time series. We can use a time series forecasting method. Since we are to provide a forecast for the next 24 hours, we can consider the following:\n\n 1. The data shows a clear daily pattern (diurnal seasonality) with prices during the night being lower and higher during the day.\n 2. We also note that the data has a weekly pattern (weekly seasonality) as weekends (like 2016/7/23 and 2016/7/24) have lower prices.\n\n We are to forecast for 2016/7/26, which is a Tuesday (since 2016/7/25 is Monday). Therefore, we can expect a pattern similar to the previous weekdays (like 2016/7/19, 2016/7/20, 2016/7/21, 2016/7/22, and 2016/7/25).\n\n Approach:\n\n Since we are only given the price and no exogenous variables (like load or wind) for the forecast period, we can use a model that captures seasonality. A simple approach is to use a seasonal naive method or an average of the same hours of the previous days.\n\n However, note that the problem says we are an expert, so we might use a more sophisticated method. But without the ability to run complex model training, we can use a simple averaging method that accounts for the day of the week and the hour of the day.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. We have 7 days of data (168 hours). We can take the same hour of the same day of the week (i.e., Tuesday) from the previous week? But we only have one week of data. Actually, we have data from 2016/7/19 (Tuesday) to 2016/7/25 (Monday). So we have one full week and one extra day (Monday 2016/7/25).\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last few weekdays (since 2016/7/26 is a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday and the Monday as they are consecutive weekdays). But note that the previous Tuesday (2016/7/19) is 7 days ago, and we also have the Monday (2016/7/25) which is the day before.\n\n 3. However, we note that the pattern on Monday (2016/7/25) is similar to the previous weekdays but not exactly the same. Also, the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) had lower prices.\n\n 4. We can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and the previous Tuesday) and also include the same day from the previous week? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n 5. Considering the data is only 7 days, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (excluding the weekend). The weekdays in the data are:\n     Tuesday (2016/7/19), Wednesday (2016/7/20), Thursday (2016/7/21), Friday (2016/7/22), and Monday (2016/7/25). \n     Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can take the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2016/7/19) and the Monday (2016/7/25) as the most recent weekday? But note that Monday is the day before, and Tuesday a week ago.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for all the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday and Monday) but that might be too many and the pattern might change over the week.\n\n 7. A simpler approach: use the average of the same hour for the last two days that are weekdays and the same day of the week (i.e., the previous Tuesday and the Monday). But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n 8. We can also consider the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) but Sunday and Saturday are weekends and have a different pattern. So we should avoid including weekends.\n\n 9. We decide to use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday 2016/7/25 and Friday 2016/7/22) and the previous Tuesday (2016/7/19). But note that Friday is not as recent as Monday and Tuesday of the previous week is 7 days ago.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday 2016/7/25) and adjust with the difference between the previous Tuesday and the Monday of that week? That might be too complex.\n\n Given the simplicity and the data available, we can use the average of the same hour for:\n\n   - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2016/7/19)\n   - The most recent weekday (Monday 2016/7/25)\n\n But note that the previous Tuesday is 7 days ago and the Monday is 1 day ago. We can take a weighted average? Or just a simple average.\n\n However, we note that the prices on 2016/7/25 (Monday) are generally higher than on 2016/7/19 (Tuesday). So we might want to give more weight to the most recent day.\n\n 11. We can use a weighted average: 0.6 for Monday (2016/7/25) and 0.4 for the previous Tuesday (2016/7/19). The weights are arbitrary but we choose to give more weight to the most recent day.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays: Monday (2016/7/25), Friday (2016/7/22), and Thursday (2016/7/21). This gives three days and we can take a simple average.\n\n Let's compare the two approaches:\n\n   Approach A: (Monday and previous Tuesday) with weights 0.6 and 0.4.\n   Approach B: average of Monday, Friday, and Thursday.\n\n We choose Approach B because it uses more recent weekdays and avoids going back a full week. The weekdays we use are:\n\n   - Thursday (2016/7/21): 3 days before the forecast day (Tuesday 2016/7/26)\n   - Friday (2016/7/22): 2 days before (but note the weekend in between, so actually 4 days? because we skip Saturday and Sunday) but in terms of weekday pattern, Friday is the last Friday and we are forecasting a Tuesday. However, we are only using the same hour of the day.\n\n   But note: the pattern on Friday might be different from Tuesday? Also, we have Monday which is the most recent and also a weekday.\n\n 13. We can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays: Monday (2016/7/25), Friday (2016/7/22), and Thursday (2016/7/21). This gives three data points for each hour.\n\n 14. However, we note that the pattern on Monday (2016/7/25) is the most recent and might be the most relevant. We can also consider including the previous Tuesday (2016/7/19) as a fourth day? But that would be 7 days ago and might be less relevant.\n\n 15. We decide to use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays: Monday (2016/7/25) and Friday (2016/7/22), and also the same day last week (Tuesday 2016/7/19). This gives three days.\n\n 16. We'll take a simple average of these three for each hour.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2016/7/26):\n\n   For hour h:\n        forecast = ( price of hour h on 2016/7/25 (Monday) + \n                     price of hour h on 2016/7/22 (Friday) + \n                     price of hour h on 2016/7/19 (Tuesday) ) / 3\n\n 17. But note: the data for 2016/7/19 is a Tuesday and we are forecasting a Tuesday, so it is the same day of the week.\n\n 18. We must be cautious: the data for 2016/7/19 is 7 days ago, and the data for 2016/7/22 is 4 days ago? (from the forecast day 2016/7/26, 2016/7/22 is 4 days before, but we skip Saturday and Sunday? Actually, 2016/7/26 is Tuesday, so:\n\n        Tuesday 2016/7/26\n        Monday 2016/7/25 -> 1 day before\n        Sunday 2016/7/24 -> 2 days before\n        Saturday 2016/7/23 -> 3 days before\n        Friday 2016/7/22 -> 4 days before)\n        Thursday 2016/7/21 -> 5 days before\n        Wednesday 2016/7/20 -> 6 days before\n        Tuesday 2016/7/19 -> 7 days before\n\n 19. So we are using:\n\n        same day last week (Tuesday 2016/7/19) -> 7 days before\n        Friday 2016/7/22 -> 4 days before\n        Monday 2016/7/25 -> 1 day before\n\n 20. This might not be the best because Friday and Monday are adjacent to the weekend. Alternatively, we can use the last three weekdays that are not separated by a weekend? But we don't have that.\n\n 21. We can also consider using the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays that are the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n 22. Given the data, we proceed with the three days: 2016/7/19 (Tuesday), 2016/7/22 (Friday), and 2016/7/25 (Monday). We compute the average for each hour.\n\n 23. Let's do the calculation for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n Example for hour 0:00:\n\n    2016/7/19 0:00: 25.08\n    2016/7/22 0:00: 25.52\n    2016/7/25 0:00: 25.78\n\n    average = (25.08 + 25.52 + 25.78) / 3 = 76.38 / 3 = 25.46\n\n 24. Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 25. However, note that the data for 2016/7/25 is the most recent and might be more indicative. We could use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days. For simplicity, we use equal weights.\n\n 26. We'll compute the 24 forecasts.\n\n 27. We must output the forecast for the next 24 hours in the required format.\n\n 28. The dates for the forecast are:\n\n        2016/7/26 0:00\n        2016/7/26 1:00\n        ...\n        2016/7/26 23:00\n\n 29. We'll compute the values and then output in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2016/7/26 0:00 [value1]\n        2016/7/26 1:00 [value2]\n        ...\n        2016/7/26 23:00 [value24]\n        </answer>\n\n 30. We note that the observed data ends at 2016/7/25 23:00, so the next hour is 2016/7/26 0:00.\n\n Let's compute:\n\n    Hour 0: (25.08 + 25.52 + 25.78) / 3 = 76.38 / 3 = 25.46\n    Hour 1: (24.94 + 25.15 + 25.28) / 3 = 75.37 / 3 = 25.1233 -> 25.12\n    Hour 2: (24.67 + 25.12 + 24.94) / 3 = 74.73 / 3 = 24.91\n    Hour 3: (24.25 + 25.02 + 24.92) / 3 = 74.19 / 3 = 24.73\n    Hour 4: (24.00 + 25.00 + 24.95) / 3 = 73.95 / 3 = 24.65\n    Hour 5: (24.29 + 25.20 + 25.14) / 3 = 74.63 / 3 = 24.8767 -> 24.88\n    Hour 6: (27.64 + 27.51 + 27.94) / 3 = 83.09 / 3 = 27.6967 -> 27.70\n    Hour 7: (29.47 + 28.15 + 28.81) / 3 = 86.43 / 3 = 28.81\n    Hour 8: (30.10 + 29.01 + 29.27) / 3 = 88.38 / 3 = 29.46\n    Hour 9: (30.07 + 29.18 + 29.84) / 3 = 89.09 / 3 = 29.6967 -> 29.70\n    Hour 10: (29.73 + 29.18 + 29.96) / 3 = 88.87 / 3 = 29.6233 -> 29.62\n    Hour 11: (29.57 + 28.83 + 29.97) / 3 = 88.37 / 3 = 29.4567 -> 29.46\n    Hour 12: (28.54 + 28.01 + 29.37) / 3 = 85.92 / 3 = 28.64\n    Hour 13: (28.28 + 27.40 + 29.11) / 3 = 84.79 / 3 = 28.2633 -> 28.26\n    Hour 14: (28.09 + 27.23 + 28.46) / 3 = 83.78 / 3 = 27.9267 -> 27.93\n    Hour 15: (28.24 + 27.40 + 28.64) / 3 = 84.28 / 3 = 28.0933 -> 28.09\n    Hour 16: (28.46 + 27.44 + 28.27) / 3 = 84.17 / 3 = 28.0567 -> 28.06\n    Hour 17: (29.56 + 27.80 + 28.72) / 3 = 86.08 / 3 = 28.6933 -> 28.69\n    Hour 18: (30.02 + 28.00 + 28.81) / 3 = 86.83 / 3 = 28.9433 -> 28.94\n    Hour 19: (29.92 + 27.82 + 28.61) / 3 = 86.35 / 3 = 28.7833 -> 28.78\n    Hour 20: (29.65 + 27.54 + 28.24) / 3 = 85.43 / 3 = 28.4767 -> 28.48\n    Hour 21: (29.66 + 27.14 + 28.06) / 3 = 84.86 / 3 = 28.2867 -> 28.29\n    Hour 22: (28.30 + 27.04 + 27.96) / 3 = 83.30 / 3 = 27.7667 -> 27.77\n    Hour 23: (25.68 + 25.96 + 26.30) / 3 = 77.94 / 3 = 25.98\n\n 31. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 32. We note that this is a simple method and might not be the most accurate, but given the constraints, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 33. We output the forecast.\n\n However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we are to handle missing values. Since there are no missing values in the provided data, we did not have to handle any.\n\n Let's write the forecast for 2016/7/26 0:00 to 23:00.\n",
