        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-11-24 00:00 to 2015-11-30 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015-12-01 00:00 to 2015-12-01 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also includes grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the historical observed prices. Since we don't have the other features, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can use a time series forecasting method that can handle univariate series. Since the data shows daily seasonality (as electricity prices typically have a pattern over 24 hours) and we are to forecast 24 hours ahead, we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\nApproach:\n1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we are told that there might be missing values. However, in the given data, there are no missing values. So we can proceed.\n\n2. We note that the data has:\n   - A daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day, with peaks in the morning and evening.\n   - Some spikes (like on 2015-11-25 and 2015-11-26) that might be due to high demand or low wind power.\n\n3. Since we are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables (like load or wind forecasts), we must use a univariate method. Suitable methods include:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters)\n   - Simple methods like using the average of the same hour from previous days.\n\n4. Given the short-term forecast (24 hours) and the strong daily seasonality, a simple but effective method is to use the average of the same hour from the last 7 days (since we have exactly 7 days of data). However, note that the weekdays and weekends might have different patterns. The data covers:\n   - 2015-11-24 (Tuesday) to 2015-11-30 (Monday) -> 7 days: 24,25,26,27,28,29,30.\n   - The next day is 2015-12-01 (Tuesday). So we can take the average of the same hour for the previous Tuesdays (2015-11-24) and also consider the pattern of the last Monday (2015-11-30) and the weekend days? But note: 2015-11-24 and 2015-11-25 (Wednesday) are weekdays, and then we have a weekend (27,28,29) and then Monday (30). \n\n   However, without more context, we can use a simple average of the last 7 days for each hour. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days are given more weight.\n\n5. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables, we can use:\n   - The average of the same hour for the last 7 days.\n\n   But note: the data on 2015-11-25 and 2015-11-26 had some spikes. We don't know if these are recurring. Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday (2015-12-01), and the only Tuesday in the data is 2015-11-24, which was a relatively normal day without a spike, we might not capture the spike. However, without more data, we can only rely on the available 7 days.\n\n6. Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of the next day:\n   - Take the same hour from each of the past 7 days and compute the average.\n\n   Example for hour 0: \n        (23.93 [2015-11-24 0:00] + 23.72 [2015-11-25 0:00] + 23.43 [2015-11-26 0:00] + 21.67 [2015-11-27 0:00] + 18.43 [2015-11-28 0:00] + 19.18 [2015-11-29 0:00] + 19.69 [2015-11-30 0:00]) / 7\n\n   But note: the data from 2015-11-27 to 2015-11-29 are weekend days and might have lower prices. The next day (2015-12-01) is a Tuesday, so it might be more similar to 2015-11-24 (Tuesday) and 2015-11-25 (Wednesday) and 2015-11-26 (Thursday) than the weekend. However, we don't have multiple Tuesdays. So we might consider:\n\n   Option 1: Use the same hour from the last 7 days and average.\n   Option 2: Use the same hour from the last 3 weekdays (2015-11-24, 2015-11-25, 2015-11-26, 2015-11-30) and the same hour from the last Tuesday (2015-11-24) and the same hour from the previous Monday (2015-11-30) and then average? But that might be too few.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the same day of the week and to more recent days.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the method. Since we are an expert, we must choose a reasonable method.\n\n   Considering the simplicity and the fact that we are only using the target variable, we will use:\n\n   - The average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which would be 2015-11-29, 2015-11-30, and 2015-11-28) might not be representative for a Tuesday.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week. We have only one Tuesday (2015-11-24) and one Monday (2015-11-30) and one Sunday (2015-11-29), etc. So we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n   Therefore, we will use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This is a common naive approach for seasonal data when multiple seasons are available.\n\n7. Calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) for the next day (2015-12-01).\n\n8. Format the answer: We must output 24 hours from 2015-12-01 00:00 to 2015-12-01 23:00.\n\nLet's compute the averages:\n\nHour 0 (00:00): \n   (23.93 + 23.72 + 23.43 + 21.67 + 18.43 + 19.18 + 19.69) / 7 = \n   = 23.93+23.72=47.65; 47.65+23.43=71.08; 71.08+21.67=92.75; 92.75+18.43=111.18; 111.18+19.18=130.36; 130.36+19.69=150.05\n   150.05 / 7 = 21.4357 -> round to 2 decimals: 21.44\n\nBut note: we should be cautious because the weekend days are lower and might pull down the average for a Tuesday. However, without more data, we proceed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the same day of the week and to recent days. For example, we can assign weights:\n\n   - The same day of the week (Tuesday) from last week: 2015-11-24 -> weight 0.4\n   - The most recent day (Monday 2015-11-30) -> weight 0.2\n   - The day before that (Sunday 2015-11-29) -> weight 0.1\n   - Then the rest: 0.3 distributed to the other 4 days? But that might be arbitrary.\n\nGiven the complexity and the requirement for a simple method, we stick to the equally weighted average of the last 7 days.\n\nWe'll compute each hour:\n\nHour 0: (23.93, 23.72, 23.43, 21.67, 18.43, 19.18, 19.69) -> 21.44\nHour 1: (23.56, 23.20, 23.20, 20.91, 17.28, 17.95, 18.22) -> \n   = 23.56+23.20=46.76; +23.20=69.96; +20.91=90.87; +17.28=108.15; +17.95=126.10; +18.22=144.32 -> 144.32/7=20.617 -> 20.62\n\nBut let's do it with a programmatic approach in mind. We can write a small table:\n\nWe have 7 days (d0 to d6) for each hour h:\n\nd0: 2015-11-24 (Tuesday)\nd1: 2015-11-25 (Wednesday)\nd2: 2015-11-26 (Thursday)\nd3: 2015-11-27 (Friday)\nd4: 2015-11-28 (Saturday)\nd5: 2015-11-29 (Sunday)\nd6: 2015-11-30 (Monday)\n\nFor hour h in [0,23]:\n   value = (d0[h] + d1[h] + d2[h] + d3[h] + d4[h] + d5[h] + d6[h]) / 7\n\nWe'll compute each hour and round to 2 decimal places.\n\nLet's do the first few:\n\nHour 0: (23.93+23.72+23.43+21.67+18.43+19.18+19.69)/7 = 150.05/7 = 21.4357 -> 21.44\nHour 1: (23.56+23.20+23.20+20.91+17.28+17.95+18.22) = 144.32/7 = 20.6171 -> 20.62\nHour 2: (23.24+23.14+23.08+20.25+16.90+17.05+17.65) = 141.31/7 = 20.1871 -> 20.19\nHour 3: (23.25+23.54+23.21+20.38+16.93+16.61+18.96) = 142.88/7 = 20.4114 -> 20.41\nHour 4: (23.68+24.22+23.56+21.07+17.52+16.29+19.95) = 146.29/7 = 20.8986 -> 20.90\nHour 5: (24.54+25.26+24.37+22.16+18.76+16.89+21.24) = 153.22/7 = 21.8886 -> 21.89\nHour 6: (25.21+26.39+26.02+23.18+19.61+17.77+22.18) = 160.36/7 = 22.9086 -> 22.91\nHour 7: (27.12+34.05+34.47+24.34+20.67+18.39+23.88) = 182.92/7 = 26.1314 -> 26.13\nHour 8: (27.76+35.95+34.44+24.90+21.48+18.84+23.99) = 187.36/7 = 26.7657 -> 26.77\nHour 9: (27.15+33.28+31.27+24.36+21.85+19.62+23.75) = 181.28/7 = 25.8971 -> 25.90\nHour 10: (27.44+34.46+35.93+24.19+22.09+20.38+23.86) = 188.35/7 = 26.9071 -> 26.91\nHour 11: (26.70+34.41+34.50+23.87+22.14+20.76+23.65) = 186.03/7 = 26.5757 -> 26.58\nHour 12: (26.34+34.17+29.25+23.75+22.12+20.79+23.60) = 180.02/7 = 25.7171 -> 25.72\nHour 13: (26.20+33.99+28.73+23.61+22.09+20.39+23.68) = 178.69/7 = 25.5271 -> 25.53\nHour 14: (26.28+35.02+29.27+23.47+22.15+20.49+23.89) = 180.57/7 = 25.7957 -> 25.80\nHour 15: (26.89+35.38+32.39+23.60+22.42+21.10+24.63) = 186.41/7 = 26.63 -> 26.63\nHour 16: (27.87+45.09+33.97+23.84+23.11+21.58+25.51) = 200.97/7 = 28.71 -> 28.71\nHour 17: (28.52+51.00+34.50+23.83+23.36+21.84+27.35) = 210.40/7 = 30.0571 -> 30.06\nHour 18: (27.72+36.64+29.38+23.51+22.91+21.75+25.43) = 187.34/7 = 26.7629 -> 26.76\nHour 19: (25.94+28.60+26.68+23.08+22.26+21.38+24.08) = 172.02/7 = 24.5743 -> 24.57\nHour 20: (25.19+26.96+25.25+22.43+21.87+20.97+23.51) = 166.18/7 = 23.74 -> 23.74\nHour 21: (24.85+25.95+24.53+22.10+21.02+20.76+23.34) = 162.55/7 = 23.2214 -> 23.22\nHour 22: (24.25+25.18+23.55+20.95+20.21+20.10+22.68) = 156.92/7 = 22.4171 -> 22.42\nHour 23: (23.65+24.31+22.81+19.73+19.21+19.29+20.80) = 149.80/7 = 21.40 -> 21.40\n\nSo the forecast for 2015-12-01:\n\n00:00: 21.44\n01:00: 20.62\n02:00: 20.19\n03:00: 20.41\n04:00: 20.90\n05:00: 21.89\n06:00: 22.91\n07:00: 26.13\n08:00: 26.77\n09:00: 25.90\n10:00: 26.91\n11:00: 26.58\n12:00: 25.72\n13:00: 25.53\n14:00: 25.80\n15:00: 26.63\n16:00: 28.71\n17:00: 30.06\n18:00: 26.76\n19:00: 24.57\n20:00: 23.74\n21:00: 23.22\n22:00: 22.42\n23:00: 21.40\n\nWe output the answer in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple average method.
