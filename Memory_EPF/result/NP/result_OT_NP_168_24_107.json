        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/1/20 0:00 to 2015/1/26 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/1/27 0:00 to 2015/1/27 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also includes grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) without any missing entries. So we can proceed without imputation.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Since we are only given the price, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the daily seasonality (as electricity prices typically exhibit daily patterns) and weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends), we can consider a model that captures these.\n\n 3. Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models, but we can use a simple approach:\n    - We note that the data shows a clear daily pattern: low during the night, rising in the morning, peaking in the morning/afternoon, and then decreasing in the evening and night.\n    - Also, we can see that weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher peaks than weekends.\n\n 4. Since the last day in the data is Monday (2015/1/26) and we are forecasting for Tuesday (2015/1/27), we can use the previous Tuesday (2015/1/20) as a reference, but also consider the recent trend.\n\n 5. However, a more robust approach would be to use an average of the last few weekdays (Tuesday to Monday) for the same hour, but note that the last two days (Saturday and Sunday) were weekends and had lower prices. Therefore, we can use the average of the same hour from the previous weekdays (excluding weekends) to capture the typical Tuesday pattern.\n\n 6. Specifically, we can compute the average for each hour of the day for the weekdays in the data (Tuesday 20th, Wednesday 21st, Thursday 22nd, Friday 23rd, and Monday 26th). Note: Saturday 24th and Sunday 25th are weekends and have a different pattern, so we exclude them.\n\n 7. But note: the data we have for Monday (26th) is the last day and might be the most relevant. Also, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average for the same hour over the last few weekdays. Since we have 5 weekdays (Tuesday to Monday, excluding the weekend in between), we can take the average of the same hour for these 5 days.\n\n 9. However, we must also account for the trend. The prices on Monday (26th) were generally lower than the previous weekdays. So we might adjust by taking the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the current Monday? This might be too complex.\n\n10. Given the simplicity required, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and Monday? But note that Monday is the next weekday after the weekend and might be more similar to Tuesday than Friday? Actually, we don't have a Tuesday in the recent data except the one from a week ago.\n\n11. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 20th). So for each hour, we take the average of:\n    - The value on Tuesday 20th (same hour)\n    - The value on Friday 23rd (same hour)\n    - The value on Monday 26th (same hour)\n\n12. But note: the data for Monday 26th is the most recent and might be the most relevant. We can use a weighted average that gives more weight to Monday and Friday and less to the previous Tuesday.\n\n13. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour for the last three weekdays that are available: Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of last week and Monday of this week. That would be 4 days. But we are missing a Tuesday in the recent week.\n\n14. Considering the above, I propose to use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the same day of the previous week (Tuesday). This gives three points. We can use a simple average.\n\n15. However, we must also note the overall level of prices. The prices on 26th were lower than the previous week. So we can adjust by the trend. We can compute the average price for the entire day of Monday (26th) and compare it to the average price of the previous Monday (19th) but we don't have the 19th. We only have from the 20th.\n\n16. Without the 19th, we can compare the average of the last 7 days and the average of the 7 days before that? But we only have 7 days of data.\n\n17. Given the data limitations, we will use the average of the same hour for:\n    - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday 20th)\n    - The same day two days ago (Monday 26th) -> but note, Monday is not Tuesday, so we use the same hour from Monday as a reference for the recent level.\n    - The same day (Friday 23rd) to capture the end of last week.\n\n    Actually, we don't have a Tuesday in the current week. The next day we are forecasting is Tuesday, so the most recent Tuesday is 20th.\n\n18. We can also consider the day-to-day changes. For example, from Monday to Tuesday in the previous week, we can compute the change and then apply that change to the current Monday to get the forecast for Tuesday.\n\n    Specifically, for each hour h:\n        forecast_h = (Tuesday_20th_h / Monday_19th_h) * Monday_26th_h\n    But we don't have Monday_19th.\n\n19. Therefore, we will use the average of the same hour from the three weekdays that are available and are not weekends: Tuesday 20th, Wednesday 21st, Thursday 22nd, Friday 23rd, and Monday 26th. But note that Monday 26th is a Monday and Tuesday 20th is a Tuesday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday. So we can take the average = (Tuesday_20th + (Wednesday_21st + Thursday_22nd + Friday_23rd + Monday_26th)/4) / 2? That doesn't seem right.\n\n20. Alternatively, we can group by hour and take the average of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (Tuesday 20th, Wednesday 21st, Thursday 22nd, Friday 23rd, and Monday 26th). This will be our forecast for each hour of the next Tuesday.\n\n21. However, note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included, so we have 5 days of data for the same hour. We can simply compute the mean for each hour across these 5 days.\n\n22. Let's do that. For each hour (0 to 23), we take the values from:\n    - 2015/1/20 (Tuesday) at hour h\n    - 2015/1/21 (Wednesday) at hour h\n    - 2015/1/22 (Thursday) at hour h\n    - 2015/1/23 (Friday) at hour h\n    - 2015/1/26 (Monday) at hour h\n\n    and then average them.\n\n23. Why include Monday? Because it is the most recent weekday and might be more indicative of the current level. Also, we are forecasting a Tuesday, which is a weekday, and we have a Tuesday from the previous week.\n\n24. This method will smooth out the daily pattern and might be reasonable.\n\n25. Let's test with an example hour: hour 0 (midnight) for the weekdays we have:\n\n    Tuesday 20th 0:00: 28.61\n    Wednesday 21st 0:00: 28.15\n    Thursday 22nd 0:00: 28.80\n    Friday 23rd 0:00: 29.87\n    Monday 26th 0:00: 26.93\n\n    Average = (28.61 + 28.15 + 28.80 + 29.87 + 26.93) / 5 = 142.36 / 5 = 28.472\n\n    So the forecast for 2015/1/27 0:00 would be 28.47 (rounded to two decimals).\n\n26. Similarly, we do for every hour.\n\n27. However, note that the weekend days (24th and 25th) are not included because they are weekends and have a different pattern.\n\n28. We must be cautious: the Monday (26th) was a relatively low day. The average for the entire day on Monday was lower than the previous weekdays. So the forecast for Tuesday might be a bit lower than the previous Tuesday.\n\n29. This method is simple and should capture the typical daily pattern of a weekday.\n\n30. We'll compute the average for each hour from 0 to 23 using the 5 weekdays.\n\n31. Let's do the calculation for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0: (28.61 + 28.15 + 28.80 + 29.87 + 26.93) / 5 = 142.36 / 5 = 28.472 -> 28.47\n    Hour 1: (28.21 + 27.89 + 28.51 + 29.17 + 26.14) / 5 = 139.92 / 5 = 27.984 -> 27.98\n    Hour 2: (28.06 + 27.80 + 28.30 + 28.86 + 25.63) / 5 = 138.65 / 5 = 27.73\n    Hour 3: (28.02 + 27.87 + 28.26 + 28.79 + 25.47) / 5 = 138.41 / 5 = 27.682 -> 27.68\n    Hour 4: (28.38 + 28.22 + 28.57 + 29.24 + 25.86) / 5 = 140.27 / 5 = 28.054 -> 28.05\n    Hour 5: (29.55 + 29.62 + 29.97 + 31.00 + 27.62) / 5 = 147.76 / 5 = 29.552 -> 29.55\n    Hour 6: (32.00 + 32.67 + 33.96 + 35.92 + 29.18) / 5 = 163.73 / 5 = 32.746 -> 32.75\n    Hour 7: (44.42 + 46.30 + 45.11 + 54.95 + 30.75) / 5 = 221.53 / 5 = 44.306 -> 44.31\n    Hour 8: (45.01 + 50.48 + 50.08 + 53.57 + 31.09) / 5 = 230.23 / 5 = 46.046 -> 46.05\n    Hour 9: (44.05 + 49.63 + 45.96 + 57.68 + 30.86) / 5 = 228.18 / 5 = 45.636 -> 45.64\n    Hour 10: (40.56 + 46.39 + 45.82 + 55.02 + 30.67) / 5 = 218.46 / 5 = 43.692 -> 43.69\n    Hour 11: (38.96 + 46.33 + 45.78 + 52.42 + 30.41) / 5 = 213.90 / 5 = 42.78\n    Hour 12: (36.94 + 44.71 + 45.00 + 47.63 + 30.23) / 5 = 204.51 / 5 = 40.902 -> 40.90\n    Hour 13: (37.36 + 43.41 + 44.38 + 44.95 + 30.16) / 5 = 200.26 / 5 = 40.052 -> 40.05\n    Hour 14: (37.46 + 43.39 + 44.89 + 42.47 + 30.23) / 5 = 198.44 / 5 = 39.688 -> 39.69\n    Hour 15: (38.97 + 45.19 + 44.99 + 40.96 + 30.65) / 5 = 200.76 / 5 = 40.152 -> 40.15\n    Hour 16: (44.51 + 47.15 + 49.82 + 44.11 + 31.34) / 5 = 216.93 / 5 = 43.386 -> 43.39\n    Hour 17: (45.26 + 52.37 + 56.67 + 48.08 + 32.08) / 5 = 234.46 / 5 = 46.892 -> 46.89\n    Hour 18: (44.41 + 51.88 + 50.06 + 45.07 + 31.58) / 5 = 223.00 / 5 = 44.60\n    Hour 19: (33.32 + 37.49 + 44.09 + 31.97 + 30.46) / 5 = 177.33 / 5 = 35.466 -> 35.47\n    Hour 20: (30.75 + 33.11 + 35.88 + 30.46 + 29.30) / 5 = 159.50 / 5 = 31.90\n    Hour 21: (30.12 + 32.46 + 36.20 + 29.85 + 28.68) / 5 = 157.31 / 5 = 31.462 -> 31.46\n    Hour 22: (29.42 + 31.30 + 32.37 + 28.90 + 27.85) / 5 = 149.84 / 5 = 29.968 -> 29.97\n    Hour 23: (28.50 + 29.36 + 30.07 + 28.53 + 26.46) / 5 = 142.92 / 5 = 28.584 -> 28.58\n\n32. Therefore, the forecast for 2015/1/27 (Tuesday) from 0:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n    0:00: 28.47\n    1:00: 27.98\n    2:00: 27.73\n    3:00: 27.68\n    4:00: 28.05\n    5:00: 29.55\n    6:00: 32.75\n    7:00: 44.31\n    8:00: 46.05\n    9:00: 45.64\n    10:00: 43.69\n    11:00: 42.78\n    12:00: 40.90\n    13:00: 40.05\n    14:00: 39.69\n    15:00: 40.15\n    16:00: 43.39\n    17:00: 46.89\n    18:00: 44.60\n    19:00: 35.47\n    20:00: 31.90\n    21:00: 31.46\n    22:00: 29.97\n    23:00: 28.58\n\n33. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple average method. In practice, more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet) would be used, but given the constraints, this should be acceptable.\n",
