        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014-11-11 00:00 to 2014-11-17 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014-11-18 00:00 to 2014-11-18 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power forecasts), we must rely on a time series model that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) without any missing values. So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and weekly seasonality (pattern that repeats every week). However, the data provided is only one week (7 days). We can use a model that captures the daily pattern.\n\n 3. Given the short history, we can use a simple model such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by taking the same hour from the previous day (or same day of the previous week? but we only have one week of data). However, we have 7 days, so we can take the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? or use the last day (Monday) to forecast the next day (Tuesday) because the next day is a Tuesday and the previous Tuesday (2014-11-11) is available? But note: the data starts on Tuesday (2014-11-11) and ends on Monday (2014-11-17). The next day is Tuesday (2014-11-18).\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the last 7 days. But note that the pattern might change from weekday to weekend. The last day (2014-11-17) is a Monday, and the day to forecast is a Tuesday. We have one previous Tuesday (2014-11-11). So we can use the previous Tuesday as a base and adjust with the recent trend? However, without additional data, it's challenging.\n\n 5. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the same day of the week (if we had multiple Tuesdays) but we only have one. So we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? or the last 7 days? \n\n 6. Considering the data, we can see that the prices have a similar pattern every day: low at night, rising in the morning, peak during the day, and then decreasing in the evening.\n\n 7. We can try to use a moving average model. For each hour h (0 to 23) of the next day, we take the average of the same hour h over the last 7 days. This would capture the daily seasonality and smooth out noise.\n\n 8. However, note that the last day (Monday) and the day to forecast (Tuesday) might be similar? But we have only one Tuesday in the data. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But the data includes a weekend (15th and 16th are Saturday and Sunday). The weekend days have lower prices.\n\n 9. Since the next day is a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2014-11-11) as the base and then adjust by the difference between the last Monday (2014-11-17) and the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week (because our data starts on Tuesday). \n\n 10. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, a simple method is to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This will account for the weekly pattern and also smooth out any daily variations.\n\n 11. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n     For hour 0: average of [26.50 (Tue), 25.97 (Wed), 29.04 (Thu), 29.48 (Fri), 27.78 (Sat), 27.07 (Sun), 27.12 (Mon)]\n        = (26.50+25.97+29.04+29.48+27.78+27.07+27.12)/7 = 193.96/7 = 27.70857 \u2248 27.71\n\n     Similarly, we do for each hour.\n\n 12. However, note that the weekend (Sat, Sun) has lower prices and might drag down the Tuesday forecast. Alternatively, we can use only the weekdays? But the next day is a weekday (Tuesday). We have 5 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon) and 2 weekend days (Sat, Sun). We can take the average of the same hour over the weekdays and then adjust for the weekend? But without more data, we stick to 7-day average.\n\n 13. Another approach: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the average of the previous week's Saturday, Sunday, Monday? That might be too complex.\n\n 14. Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 7 days, I will use the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n 15. We calculate the average for each of the 24 hours:\n\n     Hour 0: (26.50, 25.97, 29.04, 29.48, 27.78, 27.07, 27.12) -> 27.71\n     Hour 1: (25.95, 25.20, 28.51, 28.24, 26.72, 25.32, 25.36) -> 26.47\n     ... and so on.\n\n 16. But note: the data we have for the same hour might not be aligned by day of week? We are taking the same hour index (0 to 23) for the last 7 days.\n\n 17. We'll compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n 18. However, we must note that the last day (Monday) and the day to forecast (Tuesday) are consecutive. The pattern of Monday and Tuesday might be more similar than Tuesday and Saturday. Therefore, we can also consider using a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? For example, we can use an exponentially weighted moving average? But the problem says we are an expert and we must handle with care.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the daily pattern and the trend. But with only 7 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\n 20. Given the above, I will use the 7-day average for each hour. This is a common baseline for seasonal time series.\n\n 21. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n     We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the values.\n\n     Hour 0: [26.50, 25.97, 29.04, 29.48, 27.78, 27.07, 27.12] -> sum=193.96, avg=27.70857 -> 27.71\n     Hour 1: [25.95, 25.20, 28.51, 28.24, 26.72, 25.32, 25.36] -> sum=185.30, avg=26.47143 -> 26.47\n     Hour 2: [25.88, 24.81, 27.64, 27.14, 26.15, 24.32, 25.08] -> sum=181.02, avg=25.86\n     Hour 3: [25.70, 24.59, 26.03, 26.68, 25.30, 23.97, 25.31] -> sum=177.58, avg=25.36857 -> 25.37\n     Hour 4: [25.90, 25.58, 27.37, 27.55, 25.40, 23.67, 26.62] -> sum=182.09, avg=26.01286 -> 26.01\n     Hour 5: [27.92, 26.77, 28.92, 29.28, 26.33, 24.03, 29.02] -> sum=192.27, avg=27.46714 -> 27.47\n     Hour 6: [30.34, 29.95, 30.78, 31.49, 27.53, 25.61, 31.21] -> sum=206.91, avg=29.55857 -> 29.56\n     Hour 7: [32.08, 31.68, 32.09, 33.30, 28.46, 26.68, 32.25] -> sum=216.54, avg=30.93429 -> 30.93\n     Hour 8: [32.52, 32.14, 32.50, 33.69, 29.09, 27.19, 32.59] -> sum=219.72, avg=31.38857 -> 31.39\n     Hour 9: [32.41, 32.17, 32.53, 33.37, 29.71, 28.20, 32.70] -> sum=221.09, avg=31.58429 -> 31.58\n     Hour 10: [32.26, 31.69, 32.31, 32.81, 30.06, 29.55, 32.66] -> sum=221.34, avg=31.62\n     Hour 11: [32.21, 31.44, 32.28, 32.52, 30.13, 30.00, 32.69] -> sum=221.27, avg=31.61\n     Hour 12: [31.91, 31.09, 31.92, 32.05, 29.93, 29.87, 32.55] -> sum=219.32, avg=31.33143 -> 31.33\n     Hour 13: [31.69, 30.96, 31.94, 31.78, 29.83, 29.25, 32.53] -> sum=217.98, avg=31.14\n     Hour 14: [31.95, 31.45, 32.30, 31.75, 29.79, 28.80, 32.81] -> sum=218.85, avg=31.26429 -> 31.26\n     Hour 15: [32.21, 31.97, 32.73, 31.79, 30.27, 29.29, 33.10] -> sum=221.36, avg=31.62286 -> 31.62\n     Hour 16: [32.94, 32.86, 33.73, 32.01, 30.83, 30.09, 33.75] -> sum=226.21, avg=32.31571 -> 32.32\n     Hour 17: [33.52, 33.48, 35.09, 32.43, 31.16, 30.83, 34.15] -> sum=230.66, avg=32.95143 -> 32.95\n     Hour 18: [32.88, 32.87, 34.06, 31.86, 30.92, 30.88, 33.65] -> sum=227.12, avg=32.44571 -> 32.45\n     Hour 19: [31.66, 31.95, 32.77, 30.89, 30.45, 30.56, 32.76] -> sum=220.94, avg=31.56286 -> 31.56\n     Hour 20: [30.76, 30.99, 31.52, 30.07, 29.99, 30.04, 31.57] -> sum=214.94, avg=30.70571 -> 30.71\n     Hour 21: [29.98, 30.70, 30.90, 29.79, 29.65, 29.74, 31.10] -> sum=211.86, avg=30.26571 -> 30.27\n     Hour 22: [28.03, 30.02, 30.51, 29.26, 29.36, 29.20, 30.77] -> sum=207.15, avg=29.59286 -> 29.59\n     Hour 23: [26.19, 28.62, 29.66, 28.38, 28.14, 28.07, 29.99] -> sum=179.05, avg=25.57857 -> 25.58? \n        Wait, let me recalculate: 26.19+28.62=54.81, +29.66=84.47, +28.38=112.85, +28.14=140.99, +28.07=169.06, +29.99=199.05 -> 199.05/7 = 28.43571 -> 28.44\n\n 22. Correction for hour 23: \n        values: 26.19, 28.62, 29.66, 28.38, 28.14, 28.07, 29.99\n        sum = 26.19+28.62=54.81; 54.81+29.66=84.47; 84.47+28.38=112.85; 112.85+28.14=140.99; 140.99+28.07=169.06; 169.06+29.99=199.05\n        avg = 199.05/7 = 28.43571 -> 28.44\n\n 23. So the forecast for 2014-11-18 00:00 to 23:00 would be:\n\n        00:00: 27.71\n        01:00: 26.47\n        02:00: 25.86\n        03:00: 25.37\n        04:00: 26.01\n        05:00: 27.47\n        06:00: 29.56\n        07:00: 30.93\n        08:00: 31.39\n        09:00: 31.58\n        10:00: 31.62\n        11:00: 31.61\n        12:00: 31.33\n        13:00: 31.14\n        14:00: 31.26\n        15:00: 31.62\n        16:00: 32.32\n        17:00: 32.95\n        18:00: 32.45\n        19:00: 31.56\n        20:00: 30.71\n        21:00: 30.27\n        22:00: 29.59\n        23:00: 28.44\n\n 24. However, note that the last day (Monday) had a higher than the previous days in some hours? And the next day is a Tuesday. We might want to adjust by the recent trend? But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\n 25. This method is simple and commonly used as a baseline.\n\n 26. We output the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014-11-18 00:00 to 2014-11-18 23:00) in the required format.\n\n 27.
