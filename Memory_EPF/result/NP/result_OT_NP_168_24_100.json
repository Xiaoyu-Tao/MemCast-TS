        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-12-02 00:00 to 2014-12-08 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014-12-09 00:00 to 2014-12-09 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple seasonal naive method, but that would not capture trends. Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model. However, without the ability to run complex model fitting here, we need a straightforward method.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - The average of the same hour in the past 7 days (if we had more data) but we only have 7 days. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2014-12-08) as a base and adjust by the trend from the previous days.\n\n However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but in this data there are none. So we proceed.\n\n Since the data shows a clear daily pattern (prices are higher during the day and lower at night) and the weekdays might have different patterns than weekends, we note:\n   - 2014-12-02 (Tuesday) to 2014-12-05 (Friday) are weekdays, 2014-12-06 and 2014-12-07 are weekend, and 2014-12-08 is a Monday.\n\n The next day is 2014-12-09, which is a Tuesday. So we can look at the previous Tuesday (2014-12-02) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n But note: the data from 2014-12-08 (Monday) is available. We can also consider the week-over-week change.\n\n Proposed method:\n   - For each hour (0 to 23) of the forecast day (Tuesday, 2014-12-09), we take the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014-12-02) and adjust it by the average change between the same hour of the last two days (Monday 2014-12-08 and the Monday a week before? But we don't have Monday a week before in the data because we start at 2014-12-02 which is Tuesday).\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of:\n   a) The same hour from the previous day (Monday 2014-12-08)\n   b) The same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2014-12-02)\n\n But note: the data only goes back to 2014-12-02, so we have one week of data.\n\n We can compute the day-over-day change from Sunday to Monday (2014-12-07 to 2014-12-08) and then apply that change to the Monday to get Tuesday? That might not be reliable.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last two days (Sunday and Monday) for each hour and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the average of the Sunday and Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Sunday and Monday of the previous week.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are limited to univariate and only 7 days, we can do:\n\n   Forecast for hour h (0-23) on 2014-12-09 = \n        (value of hour h on 2014-12-08 [Monday] + value of hour h on 2014-12-02 [Tuesday]) / 2\n\n But this ignores the trend. Alternatively, we can compute the trend from the last two days and project:\n\n   Let:\n        Monday_h = value at hour h on 2014-12-08\n        Tuesday_prev_h = value at hour h on 2014-12-02\n\n        trend_h = (Monday_h - value at hour h on 2014-12-07 [Sunday])   [for the last day change]\n\n   Then: forecast_h = Monday_h + (Monday_h - Sunday_h)   [this is a naive trend projection]\n\n   But that might be too simplistic and volatile.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour. Since we have 7 days, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays? But the next day is a Tuesday, so we can use:\n\n   - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014-12-02)\n   - The same hour from Monday (2014-12-08) and Friday (2014-12-05) and Thursday (2014-12-04) might be too far.\n\n Given the data, I propose:\n\n   We note that the prices on weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) are generally higher than on weekends. The Monday (2014-12-08) is a weekday and the previous Tuesday (2014-12-02) is also a weekday.\n\n   We can compute the average of the same hour for the weekdays we have: \n        Tuesday (2014-12-02), Wednesday (2014-12-03), Thursday (2014-12-04), Friday (2014-12-05), and Monday (2014-12-08) [since Monday is the same week as the next Tuesday?]\n\n   But note: Monday is the day before Tuesday, so it is the most recent. We can give more weight to Monday and the previous Tuesday.\n\n   We'll use: \n        forecast_h = (Monday_h * 0.5 + Tuesday_prev_h * 0.3 + (Wednesday_prev_h + Thursday_prev_h + Friday_prev_h)/3 * 0.2)\n\n   However, without a clear model, and to keep it simple, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (from 2014-12-02 to 2014-12-05 and 2014-12-08) for each hour.\n\n   But note: 2014-12-08 is a Monday and the previous weekdays are 2014-12-02 (Tue), 2014-12-03 (Wed), 2014-12-04 (Thu), 2014-12-05 (Fri). So 5 days.\n\n   So for each hour h in [0,23]:\n        forecast_h = (h_price[2014-12-02] + h_price[2014-12-03] + h_price[2014-12-04] + h_price[2014-12-05] + h_price[2014-12-08]) / 5\n\n   This is a simple average of the same hour over the last 5 weekdays.\n\n   Why not include the weekend? Because the next day is a weekday and weekends have a different pattern.\n\n   Let's test for one hour, say hour 0 (midnight):\n\n        Tue (12/02): 31.05\n        Wed (12/03): 31.51\n        Thu (12/04): 31.44\n        Fri (12/05): 31.50\n        Mon (12/08): 29.45\n\n        Average = (31.05+31.51+31.44+31.50+29.45)/5 = 154.95/5 = 30.99\n\n   Now, what was the actual pattern? The last few midnights: \n        12/08: 29.45 (Monday)\n        12/07: 30.29 (Sunday) -> not included because weekend\n        12/06: 31.50 (Saturday) -> not included\n\n   We see a drop on Monday. So the average 30.99 is above Monday's 29.45. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) with more weight on Monday:\n\n        forecast_0 = (29.45 * 0.6 + 31.05 * 0.3 + 31.50 * 0.1) = 17.67 + 9.315 + 3.15 = 30.135\n\n   But without knowing the best weights, the simple average might be acceptable.\n\n   However, note that the data shows a general decline in the overnight prices in the last two days (Monday was 29.45, Sunday 30.29, Saturday 31.50). So the average of 30.99 might be too high.\n\n   Another approach: use the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 7 days? \n\n   Considering the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without external variables, we will use the average of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon) for the next Tuesday.\n\n   But note: the Monday (2014-12-08) is the most recent and might be more indicative. We can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days.\n\n   Weights: \n        Monday (2014-12-08): weight 3\n        Friday (2014-12-05): weight 2\n        Thursday (2014-12-04): weight 1\n        Wednesday (2014-12-03): weight 1\n        Tuesday (2014-12-02): weight 1\n\n   Then for hour 0:\n        (29.45*3 + 31.50*2 + 31.44*1 + 31.51*1 + 31.05*1) / (3+2+1+1+1) \n        = (88.35 + 63.0 + 31.44 + 31.51 + 31.05) / 8 = 245.35 / 8 = 30.66875\n\n   We can round to two decimals: 30.67\n\n   Let's do another hour, say hour 7 (7:00 AM) which is a peak hour:\n\n        Tue (12/02): 36.09\n        Wed (12/03): 36.57\n        Thu (12/04): 36.52\n        Fri (12/05): 35.38\n        Mon (12/08): 33.32\n\n        Weighted: 33.32*3 + 35.38*2 + 36.52*1 + 36.57*1 + 36.09*1 = 99.96 + 70.76 + 36.52 + 36.57 + 36.09 = 279.9\n        divided by 8 -> 34.9875 -> 34.99\n\n   Without weights, the average would be (36.09+36.57+36.52+35.38+33.32)/5 = 178.88/5 = 35.776, which is higher.\n\n   Given the recent Monday was 33.32, which is lower, the weighted average brings it down.\n\n   We'll use this weighted average for each hour.\n\n   Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n        h_Tue_prev = value at hour h on 2014-12-02\n        h_Wed_prev = value at hour h on 2014-12-03\n        h_Thu_prev = value at hour h on 2014-12-04\n        h_Fri_prev = value at hour h on 2014-12-05\n        h_Mon_prev = value at hour h on 2014-12-08   [note: this is the Monday of the same week as the forecast day? Actually, the forecast day is the next day after 2014-12-08, so 2014-12-09 is Tuesday of the same week as 2014-12-08 (Monday).]\n\n   Then:\n        h_forecast = (3 * h_Mon_prev + 2 * h_Fri_prev + 1 * h_Thu_prev + 1 * h_Wed_prev + 1 * h_Tue_prev) / 8\n\n   We'll compute for each hour.\n\n   However, note: the data for 2014-12-08 is the last day in the provided data.\n\n   Let's extract the data for these days:\n\n        Tuesday 2014-12-02: hours 0 to 23 (index 0 to 23 in the given data)\n        Wednesday 2014-12-03: hours 24 to 47\n        Thursday 2014-12-04: hours 48 to 71\n        Friday 2014-12-05: hours 72 to 95\n        Monday 2014-12-08: hours 144 to 167   [because 7 days * 24 = 168, so the last 24 hours are 2014-12-08]\n\n   We can create a list for each hour:\n\n        hour0: [index0: 31.05, index24: 31.51, index48: 31.44, index72: 31.50, index144: 29.45]\n        hour1: [index1: 30.59, index25: 31.15, index49: 31.05, index73: 31.05, index145: 28.97] \n        ... and so on.\n\n   Then compute the weighted average for each hour.\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   Let's code it in our mind:\n\n        hours = list of 24 lists, each list for hour i will have the 5 values.\n\n        Then for i in 0..23:\n            value = (3 * Monday_value[i] + 2 * Friday_value[i] + Thursday_value[i] + Wednesday_value[i] + Tuesday_value[i]) / 8.0\n\n   We output the forecast for 2014-12-09 00:00 to 2014-12-09 23:00.\n\n   Format: \n        date and time in the same format: \"YYYY/MM/DD H:MM\", but note the original format: \"2014/12/2 0:00\" for December 2, and \"2014/12/8 0:00\" for December 8.\n\n   For the next day: 2014/12/9 0:00 to 2014/12/9 23:00.\n\n   We'll generate the dates accordingly.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Parse the given data to extract the 5 weekdays for each hour.\n\n   We note the data is given in order. The first 24 hours: 2014-12-02 (Tuesday)\n   Then 2014-12-03 (Wednesday): next 24\n   Then 2014-12-04 (Thursday): next 24\n   Then 2014-12-05 (Friday): next 24\n   Then 2014-12-06 (Saturday): next 24\n   Then 2014-12-07 (Sunday): next 24\n   Then 2014-12-08 (Monday): last 24\n\n   We only need Tuesday (index0: 0-23), Wednesday (24-47), Thursday (48-71), Friday (72-95), Monday (144-167).\n\n   For hour of the day i (0 to 23):\n\n        Tuesday_prev = data[i]   [i from 0 to 23]\n        Wednesday_prev = data[24+i]\n        Thursday_prev = data[48+i]\n        Friday_prev = data[72+i]\n        Monday_prev = data[144+i]\n\n   Then compute:\n        forecast_i = (3 * Monday_prev + 2 * Friday_prev + Thursday_prev + Wednesday_prev + Tuesday_prev) / 8.0\n\n   Then round to two decimal places.\n\n   Step 2: Output the forecast for 2014-12-09 from hour 0 to 23.\n\n   Format each line: \"2014/12/9 H:00 <forecast_value>\", with H from 0 to 23.\n\n   Note: the original format uses single digit for the day and hour? \n        Example: \"2014/12/2 0:00\" for December 2, hour 0.

So we are good.\n\n   This is a simple heuristic. In practice, more sophisticated models (like SARIMA or machine learning) would be used, but given the constraints, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n   Let's output.\n",
