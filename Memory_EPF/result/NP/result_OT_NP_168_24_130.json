        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-06-30 00:00 to 2015-07-06 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-07-07 00:00 to 2015-07-07 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 entries for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: \n   - Seasonal Naive method: The electricity prices often exhibit daily seasonality (24-hour period). \n     We can use the prices from the same hour of the previous day (or same day of the week) as the forecast.\n\n However, note that the data includes a week (from Wednesday to Tuesday). The next 24 hours is a Wednesday (2015-07-07 is a Tuesday? Let's check: 2015-06-30 is Tuesday, so 2015-07-01 Wednesday, ... 2015-07-06 is Monday, 2015-07-07 is Tuesday). \n\n But note: \n   2015-06-30: Tuesday\n   2015-07-01: Tuesday + 1 -> Wednesday\n   2015-07-02: Thursday\n   2015-07-03: Friday\n   2015-07-04: Saturday\n   2015-07-05: Sunday\n   2015-07-06: Monday\n   2015-07-07: Tuesday\n\n So the next 24 hours (2015-07-07) is a Tuesday.\n\n We can use the previous Tuesday (2015-06-30) as a reference? But note that the pattern might change week to week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last few same weekdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the past week (2015-06-30). \n\n Another approach: use the last week same day (i.e., 7 days ago) and adjust with the most recent day? \n\n However, since we are only allowed to use the given data and no external variables, and we are to provide a forecast for 24 hours, we can use:\n\n Method 1: Seasonal Naive with seasonality of 24 hours (using the previous day's same hour). \n   - Forecast for 2015-07-07 00:00 = 2015-07-06 00:00 (which is 10.77) \n   - But note: 2015-07-06 is Monday and 2015-07-07 is Tuesday, so the pattern might be different.\n\n Method 2: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago: 2015-06-30) for the same hour. \n   - Forecast for 2015-07-07 00:00 = 2015-06-30 00:00 (13.66)\n\n But we have more recent data. We can combine both: use an average of the last two same weekdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the history.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the last few days for the same hour? \n\n Considering the above, a common approach in electricity price forecasting is to use the average of the same hour of the last n days (e.g., n=3) or the same hour of the same weekday in the last week and the last day.\n\n However, without more data (like multiple weeks) and without exogenous variables, we have to keep it simple.\n\n Proposed method: \n   We note that the data shows a clear daily pattern. We can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which would be Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for forecasting Tuesday? But Tuesday might be different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous week (Tuesday, 2015-06-30) and the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2015-07-06) and take an average? \n\n But note: \n   The price on 2015-06-30 (Tuesday) at 00:00: 13.66\n   The price on 2015-07-06 (Monday) at 00:00: 10.77\n\n We don't have a Tuesday from two weeks ago. \n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (i.e., Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for the forecast. \n\n Why 3 days? Because it captures the most recent pattern and averages out some noise.\n\n Steps for each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2015-07-07):\n   forecast_h = (price_{2015-07-06 h:00} + price_{2015-07-05 h:00} + price_{2015-07-04 h:00}) / 3\n\n But note: 2015-07-04 is Saturday, 2015-07-05 Sunday, 2015-07-06 Monday. The forecast day is Tuesday. \n However, we don't have a Tuesday in the last 3 days. So we are using the average of Saturday, Sunday, Monday for a Tuesday? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (2015-06-30, Tuesday) and then adjust by the trend of the last week? \n\n But without more data, we can do:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_{2015-06-30 h:00}   [Tuesday last week] \n                + price_{2015-07-06 h:00}   [Monday, the day before the forecast day]\n                ) / 2\n\n However, the last week Tuesday is 7 days ago and the Monday is the day before. This might not be ideal.\n\n Another idea: use the same hour of the previous day (Monday) and the same hour of the same weekday from last week (Tuesday) and then take a weighted average? \n\n But note: the pattern on Monday might be more similar to Tuesday than Saturday? \n\n Considering the above, and the fact that we have only 7 days of data, I will use the average of the same hour of the last three days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for the forecast. \n\n Let's calculate for h=0 (00:00):\n   Saturday (2015-07-04 00:00): 9.55\n   Sunday (2015-07-05 00:00): 10.28\n   Monday (2015-07-06 00:00): 10.77\n   Average = (9.55 + 10.28 + 10.77) / 3 = 30.6 / 3 = 10.20\n\n But note: the price on the last Tuesday (2015-06-30 00:00) was 13.66, which is higher. However, the recent trend (last 3 days) shows lower prices at 00:00. \n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to use our expertise, I choose the average of the last 3 days (same hour) as the forecast.\n\n However, we must note that the data shows a downward trend in the last week? Let's see the 00:00 prices:\n   2015-06-30: 13.66\n   2015-07-01: 13.34\n   2015-07-02: 10.57\n   2015-07-03: 4.95\n   2015-07-04: 9.55\n   2015-07-05: 10.28\n   2015-07-06: 10.77\n\n The last three days (4th,5th,6th) are around 10, so 10.20 seems reasonable.\n\n Let's do the same for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data for 2015-07-04, 2015-07-05, 2015-07-06 are complete.\n\n We will compute for each hour (0 to 23) the average of the same hour on 4th, 5th, and 6th of July.\n\n Steps:\n   For hour h in [0,23]:\n        forecast_h = (price_2015-07-04_h + price_2015-07-05_h + price_2015-07-06_h) / 3\n\n We have:\n   2015-07-04: from 0:00 to 23:00\n   2015-07-05: from 0:00 to 23:00\n   2015-07-06: from 0:00 to 23:00\n\n We can compute the values.\n\n However, note: the last three days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. The forecast day is Tuesday. \n There might be a weekly pattern: weekdays (Monday to Friday) are different from weekends. \n But we are using two weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and one weekday (Monday) to forecast a weekday (Tuesday). \n\n Alternatively, we could use only the last two weekdays? But we only have Monday (2015-07-06) and the previous Tuesday (2015-06-30) as weekdays. \n\n Given the data, I think the average of the last three days is a reasonable and simple approach.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2015-07-07 00:00 to 2015-07-07 23:00):\n\n We'll create a list for the forecast:\n\n   Hour 0 (00:00): (9.55 + 10.28 + 10.77) / 3 = 30.6 / 3 = 10.20\n   Hour 1 (01:00): (9.16 + 10.05 + 9.41) / 3 = 28.62 / 3 = 9.54\n   Hour 2 (02:00): (8.94 + 9.53 + 8.64) / 3 = 27.11 / 3 = 9.0367 -> 9.04\n   Hour 3 (03:00): (8.56 + 9.14 + 7.19) / 3 = 24.89 / 3 = 8.2967 -> 8.30\n   Hour 4 (04:00): (8.22 + 8.95 + 6.10) / 3 = 23.27 / 3 = 7.7567 -> 7.76\n   Hour 5 (05:00): (8.39 + 8.83 + 8.74) / 3 = 25.96 / 3 = 8.6533 -> 8.65\n   Hour 6 (06:00): (8.22 + 9.48 + 11.12) / 3 = 28.82 / 3 = 9.6067 -> 9.61\n   Hour 7 (07:00): (9.23 + 9.98 + 12.44) / 3 = 31.65 / 3 = 10.55\n   Hour 8 (08:00): (9.30 + 9.55 + 13.49) / 3 = 32.34 / 3 = 10.78\n   Hour 9 (09:00): (10.68 + 11.31 + 13.85) / 3 = 35.84 / 3 = 11.9467 -> 11.95\n   Hour 10 (10:00): (11.41 + 12.29 + 13.93) / 3 = 37.63 / 3 = 12.5433 -> 12.54\n   Hour 11 (11:00): (11.51 + 12.54 + 13.58) / 3 = 37.63 / 3 = 12.5433 -> 12.54\n   Hour 12 (12:00): (11.12 + 12.66 + 13.01) / 3 = 36.79 / 3 = 12.2633 -> 12.26\n   Hour 13 (13:00): (10.24 + 12.35 + 12.50) / 3 = 35.09 / 3 = 11.6967 -> 11.70\n   Hour 14 (14:00): (9.53 + 12.07 + 11.94) / 3 = 33.54 / 3 = 11.18\n   Hour 15 (15:00): (9.39 + 11.80 + 11.44) / 3 = 32.63 / 3 = 10.8767 -> 10.88\n   Hour 16 (16:00): (9.99 + 12.19 + 10.67) / 3 = 32.85 / 3 = 10.95\n   Hour 17 (17:00): (11.13 + 12.68 + 10.97) / 3 = 34.78 / 3 = 11.5933 -> 11.59\n   Hour 18 (18:00): (11.72 + 13.26 + 11.13) / 3 = 36.11 / 3 = 12.0367 -> 12.04\n   Hour 19 (19:00): (11.26 + 13.47 + 11.18) / 3 = 35.91 / 3 = 11.97\n   Hour 20 (20:00): (10.21 + 13.06 + 11.00) / 3 = 34.27 / 3 = 11.4233 -> 11.42\n   Hour 21 (21:00): (9.95 + 12.24 + 11.10) / 3 = 33.29 / 3 = 11.0967 -> 11.10\n   Hour 22 (22:00): (10.62 + 12.00 + 10.92) / 3 = 33.54 / 3 = 11.18\n   Hour 23 (23:00): (9.57 + 10.86 + 9.55) / 3 = 29.98 / 3 = 9.9933 -> 10.00\n\n But note: the last value for 2015-07-06 23:00 is 9.55 (as per the data). \n\n However, let me double-check the data for 2015-07-06 23:00: \n   The last line: \"2015/7/6 23:00  9.55\"\n\n So the calculation for hour 23: \n   2015-07-04 23:00: 9.57\n   2015-07-05 23:00: 10.86\n   2015-07-06 23:00: 9.55\n   Sum = 9.57 + 10.86 + 9.55 = 29.98 -> 29.98/3 = 9.9933 -> 10.00 (rounded to two decimals as in the input)\n\n We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2015-07-07:\n\n   00:00: 10.20\n   01:00: 9.54\n   02:00: 9.04\n   03:00: 8.30\n   04:00: 7.76\n   05:00: 8.65\n   06:00: 9.61\n   07:00: 10.55\n   08:00: 10.78\n   09:00: 11.95\n   10:00: 12.54\n   11:00: 12.54\n   12:00: 12.26\n   13:00: 11.70\n   14:00: 11.18\n   15:00: 10.88\n   16:00: 10.95\n   17:00: 11.59\n   18:00: 12.04\n   19:00: 11.97\n   20:00: 11.42\n   21:00: 11.10\n   22:00: 11.18\n   23:00: 10.00\n\n We output the forecast in the next 24 hours in the required format.\n\n Note: The dates for the forecast are 2015/7/7 0:00 to 2015/7/7 23:00.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2015/7/7 0:00 10.20\n        2015/7/7 1:00 9.54\n        ... \n        2015/7/7 23:00 10.00\n    </answer>\n",
