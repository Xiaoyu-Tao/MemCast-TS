        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015/7/7 0:00 to 2015/7/13 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2015/7/14 0:00 to 2015/7/14 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 entries for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: \n   - Seasonal Naive method: The electricity prices have a strong daily (24-hour) seasonality. We can use the prices from the same hour of the previous day (or same hour of the same day of the week) as the forecast.\n\n However, note that the data provided is from Tuesday (2015/7/7) to Monday (2015/7/13). The next day is Tuesday (2015/7/14). \n We can use the previous Tuesday (2015/7/7) as a reference, but note that the pattern might change slightly.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last few same hours (e.g., average of the same hour over the last 7 days) to account for the daily seasonality.\n\n But note: The data shows a weekly pattern? Let's observe:\n\n   Tues (7/7): \n        0:00: 5.75, 1:00:5.93, ... 23:00:10.67\n   Wed (8/7): \n        0:00:8.12, ... 23:00:5.49\n   Thu (9/7): \n        0:00:4.35, ... 23:00:4.50\n   Fri (10/7): \n        0:00:3.86, ... 23:00:7.90\n   Sat (11/7): \n        0:00:7.40, ... 23:00:8.69\n   Sun (12/7): \n        0:00:8.21, ... 23:00:8.67\n   Mon (13/7): \n        0:00:8.41, ... 23:00:9.22\n\n We are forecasting for the next Tuesday (14/7). We have one previous Tuesday (7/7) and also we can use the average of the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust with the trend? But without more Tuesdays, it's hard.\n\n Considering the data, we can use:\n   - The previous day (Monday, 13/7) as a base, but note that Monday and Tuesday might have different patterns (weekday vs. weekday, but Tuesday might have a different load pattern than Monday?).\n\n However, in the absence of multiple weeks, a common approach is to use a seasonal naive with a seasonality of 24 hours (i.e., use the value from 24 hours ago). But let's see:\n\n   We are forecasting for 2015/7/14 0:00 -> we can use the value from 2015/7/13 0:00 (which is 8.41) OR use the value from the same day of the week (last Tuesday at 0:00: 5.75). \n\n Since we have only one week of data, and the pattern from Monday to Tuesday might be similar? But looking at the data, the Monday (13/7) at 0:00 was 8.41 and the previous Tuesday (7/7) at 0:00 was 5.75. The overall level of Monday was higher than the previous Tuesday.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last 7 days at the same hour? But we have only 7 days? Actually, we have 7 days (from 7/7 to 7/13). So we can compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n For example, for hour 0:00:\n   Tue: 5.75, Wed:8.12, Thu:4.35, Fri:3.86, Sat:7.40, Sun:8.21, Mon:8.41 -> average = (5.75+8.12+4.35+3.86+7.40+8.21+8.41)/7 = 6.59\n\n But note: the data shows a trend? The prices in the last few days (from 7/9 to 7/13) are generally increasing? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the problem is to forecast 24 hours and we are an expert, so we must choose a reasonable method.\n\n Considering simplicity and the strong daily seasonality, I propose:\n\n   Forecast for hour h (0 to 23) on 2015/7/14 = average of the same hour h over the last 7 days (i.e., from 2015/7/7 to 2015/7/13).\n\n But note: the data for the last 7 days might include weekends? The last 7 days: \n   7/7: Tuesday\n   7/8: Wednesday\n   7/9: Thursday\n   7/10: Friday\n   7/11: Saturday\n   7/12: Sunday\n   7/13: Monday\n\n So the average for each hour will include one of each day of the week. This might be acceptable.\n\n However, we can also consider that the pattern on Tuesday might be more similar to the previous Tuesday? But we have one Tuesday. \n\n Given the data, I will use the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n   Let h be the hour (0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00)\n   Collect the 7 values for that hour from the 7 days (7/7 to 7/13)\n   Compute the average.\n\n But note: the data for the same hour on different days of the week might have different patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends). However, the next day is a Tuesday (weekday). We could also use only the weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) and also to the most recent days? But without a clear model, we stick to the simple average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0:00: [5.75, 8.12, 4.35, 3.86, 7.40, 8.21, 8.41] -> average = (5.75+8.12+4.35+3.86+7.40+8.21+8.41)/7 = 6.59\n   Hour 1:00: [5.93, 6.88, 3.96, 3.54, 6.98, 7.50, 7.82] -> average = (5.93+6.88+3.96+3.54+6.98+7.50+7.82)/7 = 6.09\n   ... and so on.\n\n However, note that the data for the last Monday (13/7) was generally higher than the previous days. We might want to give more weight to the recent days? But the problem does not to use complex models.\n\n Since the requirement is for a short-term forecast and we are an expert, we can also consider the following:\n\n   We can use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) as a base and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the Monday of the previous week? \n\n   But we don't have the Monday of the previous week (we have from Tuesday to Monday). The previous week Monday is missing.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n However, let me check the data: \n   The prices on Monday (13/7) were higher than the previous days. The average might be pulled down by the lower prices earlier in the week.\n\n Another idea: use the median? or use only the last 3 days? \n\n But note: the problem says \"short-term\", and the most recent days might be more relevant. We can use the average of the last 3 days (which includes Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for the same hour? \n\n   The next day is Tuesday, and the last 3 days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday (weekend and Monday). The pattern on Tuesday might be more similar to Monday (both weekdays) than to the weekend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same day of the week (but we have only one Tuesday) and the previous day (Monday). \n\n   Forecast = (last Tuesday's value + last Monday's value) / 2? \n\n   But that would be too simplistic and might not capture the trend.\n\n Considering the above, I decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (i.e., Saturday, Sunday, Monday) because they are the most recent and might reflect the current trend.\n\n Why 3 days? It's a common window for short-term forecasting to capture recent trends without being too volatile.\n\n Steps for each hour h:\n   value_h = (value of h on 2015/7/11 (Sat) + value of h on 2015/7/12 (Sun) + value of h on 2015/7/13 (Mon)) / 3\n\n But note: the next day is a Tuesday, and we are using weekend days? The weekend days have different patterns? \n\n Let's compare the same hour (e.g., 0:00) for the last 3 days and the previous Tuesday:\n\n   Sat (11/7) 0:00: 7.40\n   Sun (12/7) 0:00: 8.21\n   Mon (13/7) 0:00: 8.41\n   average = (7.40+8.21+8.41)/3 = 8.01\n\n   Previous Tuesday (7/7) 0:00: 5.75\n\n The average of the last 3 days at 0:00 is 8.01, which is higher than the previous Tuesday. This might be because of an upward trend.\n\n But we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the last Tuesday was 5.75. However, the recent days are around 8. So we might expect the Tuesday to be around 8? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days, but that includes the low Tuesday from last week and might be too low.\n\n Given the upward trend, I think the 3-day average is more appropriate.\n\n However, to be safe, we can also consider the 7-day average and the 3-day average and take a weighted average? \n\n Without more information, I will use the 3-day average (last Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for each hour.\n\n Let's compute the 3-day average for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n We have:\n\n   Hour 0:00: (7.40, 8.21, 8.41) -> (7.40+8.21+8.41)/3 = 8.0067 -> round to 2 decimals: 8.01\n   Hour 1:00: (6.98, 7.50, 7.82) -> (6.98+7.50+7.82)/3 = 7.4333 -> 7.43\n   Hour 2:00: (6.76, 6.64, 7.40) -> (6.76+6.64+7.40)/3 = 6.9333 -> 6.93\n   Hour 3:00: (6.57, 6.18, 7.11) -> (6.57+6.18+7.11)/3 = 6.62\n   Hour 4:00: (6.18, 5.71, 7.02) -> (6.18+5.71+7.02)/3 = 6.3033 -> 6.30\n   Hour 5:00: (6.48, 5.71, 8.25) -> (6.48+5.71+8.25)/3 = 6.8133 -> 6.81\n   Hour 6:00: (6.77, 6.15, 10.87) -> (6.77+6.15+10.87)/3 = 7.93\n   Hour 7:00: (8.12, 7.03, 12.40) -> (8.12+7.03+12.40)/3 = 9.1833 -> 9.18\n   Hour 8:00: (8.95, 8.08, 13.89) -> (8.95+8.08+13.89)/3 = 10.3067 -> 10.31\n   Hour 9:00: (10.18, 8.84, 15.08) -> (10.18+8.84+15.08)/3 = 11.3667 -> 11.37\n   Hour 10:00: (11.32, 9.55, 15.38) -> (11.32+9.55+15.38)/3 = 12.0833 -> 12.08\n   Hour 11:00: (11.75, 10.19, 15.31) -> (11.75+10.19+15.31)/3 = 12.4167 -> 12.42\n   Hour 12:00: (11.42, 9.53, 14.70) -> (11.42+9.53+14.70)/3 = 11.8833 -> 11.88\n   Hour 13:00: (10.29, 9.11, 14.27) -> (10.29+9.11+14.27)/3 = 11.2233 -> 11.22\n   Hour 14:00: (9.42, 8.90, 13.86) -> (9.42+8.90+13.86)/3 = 10.7267 -> 10.73\n   Hour 15:00: (9.24, 8.83, 13.33) -> (9.24+8.83+13.33)/3 = 10.4667 -> 10.47\n   Hour 16:00: (9.24, 8.94, 12.43) -> (9.24+8.94+12.43)/3 = 10.2033 -> 10.20\n   Hour 17:00: (10.38, 9.41, 12.26) -> (10.38+9.41+12.26)/3 = 10.6833 -> 10.68\n   Hour 18:00: (10.78, 9.86, 12.22) -> (10.78+9.86+12.22)/3 = 10.9533 -> 10.95\n   Hour 19:00: (11.03, 10.16, 11.97) -> (11.03+10.16+11.97)/3 = 11.0533 -> 11.05\n   Hour 20:00: (10.48, 9.93, 11.21) -> (10.48+9.93+11.21)/3 = 10.54\n   Hour 21:00: (9.60, 9.77, 11.20) -> (9.60+9.77+11.20)/3 = 10.19\n   Hour 22:00: (9.47, 9.43, 10.70) -> (9.47+9.43+10.70)/3 = 9.8667 -> 9.87\n   Hour 23:00: (8.69, 8.67, 9.22) -> (8.69+8.67+9.22)/3 = 8.86\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2015/7/14 (Tuesday) from 0:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n   0:00: 8.01\n   1:00: 7.43\n   2:00: 6.93\n   3:00: 6.62\n   4:00: 6.30\n   5:00: 6.81\n   6:00: 7.93\n   7:00: 9.18\n   8:00: 10.31\n   9:00: 11.37\n   10:00: 12.08\n   11:00: 12.42\n   12:00: 11.88\n   13:00: 11.22\n   14:00: 10.73\n   15:00: 10.47\n   16:00: 10.20\n   17:00: 10.68\n   18:00: 10.95\n   19:00: 11.05\n   20:00: 10.54\n   21:00: 10.19\n   22:00: 9.87\n   23:00: 8.86\n\n However, note that the last Monday (13/7) had a spike in the morning and afternoon, which might be due to weekday demand. The weekend days (Sat and Sun) had lower prices. By averaging with the weekend, we might be lowering the forecast for the weekday (Tuesday). \n\n But we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we are including one weekend day and one Monday). This might be acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we could use only the last Monday and the previous Tuesday? But the previous Tuesday is 7 days ago and the market conditions might have changed.\n\n Given the above, I will stick to the 3-day average (Sat, Sun, Mon) for each hour.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2015/7/14 0:00 to 2015/7/14 23:00) is as above.\n\n Let me write the answer in the required format.\n\n Note: The dates in the forecast should be from 2015/7/14 0:00 to 2015/7/14 23:00.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2015/7/14 0:00 8.01\n        2015/7/14 1:00 7.43\n        2015/7/14 2:00 6.93\n        2015/7/14 3:00 6.62\n        2015/7/14 4:00 6.30\n        2015/7/14 5:00 6.81\n        2015/7/14 6:00 7.93\n        2015/7/14 7:00 9.18\n        2015/7/14 8:00 10.31\n        2015/7/14 9:00 11.37\n        2015/7/14 10:00 12.08\n        2015/7/14 11:00 12.42\n        2015/7/14 12:00 11.88\n        2015/7/14 13:00 11.22\n        2015/7/14 14:00 10.73\n        2015/7/14 15:00 10.47\n        2015/7/14 16:00 10.20\n        2015/7/14 17:00 10.68\n        2015/7/14 18:00 10.95\n        2015/7/14 19:00 11.05\n        2015/7/14 20:00 10.54\n        2015/7/14 21:00 10.19\n        2015/7/14 22:00 9.87\n        2015/7/14 23:00 8.86\n    </answer>\n\n But note: the problem says \"Observed Nord Pool electricity price (\u20ac/MWh, 1-hour resolution)\" and the historical data had two decimal places. We are rounding to two decimals.\n\n However, the computed averages might have more decimals. We round to two decimals as in the input.\n\n Let me double-check the calculations for a few:\n\n   Hour 0:00: (7.40+8.21+8.41)=24.02 -> 24.02/3=8.00666... -> 8.01\n   Hour 1:00: (6.98+7.50+7.82)=22.30 -> 22.30/3=7.4333... -> 7.43\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n We output the forecast in the same format as the input (date and time, then the value).\n\n Since the problem says \"the next 24 recorded hours\", we start at 0:00 and go to 23:00 for 2015/7/14.\n\n We are done.\n",
