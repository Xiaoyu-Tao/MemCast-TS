        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-12-13 00:00 to 2016-12-19 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-12-20 00:00 to 2016-12-20 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we note that the data is given in chronological order and there are no gaps in the dates and times.\n\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we can use a time series method. Given the data is at hourly resolution and we have a week of data, we can observe daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, we only have one week of data, so weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n 3. We note that the price has a clear pattern: lower during the night and early morning, and higher during the day, especially in the morning and evening peaks.\n\n 4. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. We can use a simple approach such as:\n    - Using the average of the same hour in the past 7 days (if we assume weekly seasonality) but note we only have 7 days of data, so we can use the same hour from the previous days.\n\n    However, we note that the last day (2016-12-19) is a Monday, and the next day (2016-12-20) is a Tuesday. We can look at the previous Tuesday (2016-12-13) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without additional variables (like grid load and wind power forecasts) we rely solely on the historical prices.\n\n 6. Considering the problem constraints and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we can use a method that captures the daily pattern and the recent trend.\n\n    Approach:\n    - We note that the weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices than the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). The day we are forecasting (2016-12-20) is a Tuesday, which is a weekday.\n\n    - We can compute the average profile for weekdays (excluding the weekend) and then adjust by the most recent day's deviation? But we only have one week of data.\n\n    - Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (2016-12-13, which was a Tuesday) and then adjust by the overall trend from the last day (2016-12-19) to the forecast day.\n\n    However, we don't have a clear trend over the week? Let's see the average of each day:\n\n        Day 1 (2016-12-13, Tue): average = (31.10+30.59+...+31.07)/24 -> we can compute roughly: \n            from the data: it starts at 31.10 and ends at 31.07, and has a peak at 38.64 and 36.28, etc. \n            We can calculate the average for each day.\n\n    But note: we are to forecast 24 hours, so we need 24 values.\n\n    Since we are limited by the data, a simple method is to use the last day (Monday, 2016-12-19) as a base and adjust it by the Tuesday of the previous week (2016-12-13) relative to the Monday of the previous week (2016-12-12 is not provided, but we have 2016-12-12? Actually, our data starts at 2016-12-13). \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and then adjust by the last day's level? \n\n    However, we note that the data for 2016-12-19 (Monday) is available. We can compute the average of each hour for the weekdays (Tuesday 13th, Wednesday 14th, Thursday 15th, Friday 16th) and then compare with Monday 19th? \n\n    But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we can take the average of the previous Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday for each hour? \n\n    However, the problem: we are missing the next day (Tuesday) and we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n    Given the constraints, we can do:\n\n        Forecast for hour h (where h from 0 to 23) on 2016-12-20 = \n            (Price of hour h on 2016-12-13 [Tuesday] + \n             Price of hour h on 2016-12-19 [Monday] * (average of the ratio of Tuesday to Monday from the previous week?)) \n\n    But we don't have the Monday of the previous week (2016-12-12). \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and the Monday (19th) and then adjust for the daily pattern? \n\n    However, we note that the pattern on weekdays is similar, but the level changes. \n\n    Another idea: use the last day (Monday) and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n    Since we don't have the previous Monday, we can use that.\n\n    Let me try a different approach: \n\n        We can use a naive method: use the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 13th) as the forecast for the next Tuesday (20th). \n\n        But we see that the overall level of prices in the last day (Monday 19th) is lower than the previous Monday? Actually, we don't have the previous Monday. \n\n        We can also note that the weekend (17th and 18th) had lower prices, and then Monday 19th was higher than the weekend but lower than the previous weekdays? \n\n        We can compute the average of the last 7 days for each hour and then use that? But that would include weekend days which are different.\n\n    Considering the above, and the fact that we are limited to 168 data points, we can do:\n\n        For each hour h (0 to 23):\n            Let same_hour_prev_week = price at hour h on 2016-12-13 (Tuesday)\n            Let same_hour_prev_day = price at hour h on 2016-12-19 (Monday)\n\n            We can take a weighted average: \n                forecast = w1 * same_hour_prev_week + w2 * same_hour_prev_day\n\n        How to choose weights? We can give more weight to the most recent day? For example, w2=0.7 and w1=0.3.\n\n    But note: the previous Tuesday (13th) was 7 days ago, and the market conditions might have changed. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (which are 14th, 15th, 16th) and the Monday (19th) and then adjust by the trend? \n\n    However, we don't have a clear trend.\n\n    Given the simplicity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we choose:\n\n        forecast_h = (same_hour_prev_week * 0.3) + (same_hour_prev_day * 0.7)\n\n    But note: the previous Tuesday (13th) and the Monday (19th) are both weekdays, but the pattern might be similar. However, we see that the Monday (19th) had a lower peak than the previous Tuesday? \n\n        On Tuesday 13th: peak at 38.64 (at 8:00) and 36.28 (at 16:00 and 17:00)\n        On Monday 19th: peak at 36.37 (at 8:00) and 35.56 (at 16:00)\n\n        So the level on Monday 19th is a bit lower.\n\n    Alternatively, we can adjust the previous Tuesday by the ratio of the Monday 19th to the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week.\n\n    Therefore, we use the weighted average with weights 0.3 and 0.7.\n\n    But note: we have the entire week, so we can compute the average of the same hour for all weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and then use that as the base, and then adjust by the last day? \n\n    Let me compute the average for each hour over the weekdays (Tuesday 13th, Wednesday 14th, Thursday 15th, Friday 16th) and then also include Monday 19th? \n\n    Then we have 5 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday. But Monday is the day before the forecast day, and the forecast day is Tuesday.\n\n    We can do:\n\n        base_h = average of hour h on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday? \n\n        But note: the pattern of Tuesday might be more similar to the forecast day (Tuesday) than the average of 5 weekdays.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        forecast_h = (average of hour h on the previous weekdays: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) * (price at hour h on Monday 19th) / (average of hour h on the previous Monday? -> not available)\n\n    Without the previous Monday, we can use the average of the previous weekdays for hour h as a base, and then adjust by the last day (Monday 19th) relative to the average of the previous weekdays for the same hour? \n\n        Let avg_weekday_h = average of hour h on the 4 weekdays (13th,14th,15th,16th)\n        Then the ratio for Monday 19th at hour h = (Monday 19th at h) / (avg_weekday_h)\n\n        Then the forecast for Tuesday 20th at hour h = avg_weekday_h * (Monday 19th at h / avg_weekday_h) * (Tuesday 13th at h / avg_weekday_h) ?\n\n        This becomes: (Monday 19th at h) * (Tuesday 13th at h) / avg_weekday_h\n\n    But that might be too volatile.\n\n    Given the complexity and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, I choose a simpler method: use the same hour from the previous week (Tuesday 13th) and adjust it by the change from the previous week's Tuesday to the current Monday? \n\n        change = (Monday 19th at h) / (Monday 12th at h)   -> but we don't have Monday 12th.\n\n    Therefore, we fall back to the weighted average of the same hour from the previous Tuesday and the same hour from the previous day (Monday).\n\n    We choose: \n        forecast_h = 0.3 * (price at hour h on 2016-12-13) + 0.7 * (price at hour h on 2016-12-19)\n\n    We use 0.3 and 0.7 because the most recent day is more relevant.\n\n    However, we note that the day of the week effect: Tuesday and Monday are both weekdays, but they are adjacent. The previous Tuesday is a week ago, so we give less weight.\n\n    Let's test for one hour: hour 0 (midnight)\n\n        Previous Tuesday (13th) at 0:00: 31.10\n        Previous day (Monday 19th) at 0:00: 30.50\n\n        Forecast for 2016-12-20 0:00 = 0.3*31.10 + 0.7*30.50 = 9.33 + 21.35 = 30.68\n\n    Now, what was the actual pattern? We don't know, but we can check the pattern of the previous days: the midnight hour on weekdays was around 2016-12-13 0:00: 31.10\n 2016-12-14 0:00: 30.93\n 2016-12-15 0:00: 31.70\n 2016-12-16 0:00: 31.40\n 2016-12-19 0:00: 30.50\n\n    The next midnight (Tuesday) might be around 31.0? Our forecast 30.68 is within the range.\n\n    We'll use this method for all 24 hours.\n\n    But note: the data for the previous Tuesday (13th) and the previous day (19th) are both available for all 24 hours.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        For hour 0:00: 0.3 * 31.10 + 0.7 * 30.50 = 30.68\n        For hour 1:00: 0.3 * 30.59 + 0.7 * 30.22 = 0.3*30.59=9.177, 0.7*30.22=21.154 -> 30.331\n        ... and so on.\n\n    However, we must be cautious: the pattern on the previous Tuesday (13th) had a morning peak of 38.64, while the Monday (19th) had a morning peak of 36.37. Our forecast for the peak hour (8:00) would be:\n\n        0.3 * 38.64 + 0.7 * 36.37 = 11.592 + 25.459 = 37.051\n\n    This seems reasonable.\n\n    But note: the previous Tuesday (13th) had a higher peak than the Monday (19th). We are forecasting a value in between.\n\n    We'll compute all 24 hours accordingly.\n\n    However, we must note that the data for the previous Tuesday (13th) is the first day in our data. We have the entire week, so we can use it.\n\n    Let's do the calculation for all 24 hours:\n\n        Hour 0: 0.3*31.10 + 0.7*30.50 = 30.68\n        Hour 1: 0.3*30.59 + 0.7*30.22 = 30.331\n        Hour 2: 0.3*30.52 + 0.7*30.09 = 30.243\n        Hour 3: 0.3*30.58 + 0.7*30.20 = 30.314\n        Hour 4: 0.3*31.06 + 0.7*30.63 = 30.789\n        Hour 5: 0.3*31.51 + 0.7*31.54 = 31.531\n        Hour 6: 0.3*33.87 + 0.7*32.93 = 33.212\n        Hour 7: 0.3*36.65 + 0.7*36.14 = 36.293\n        Hour 8: 0.3*38.64 + 0.7*36.37 = 37.051\n        Hour 9: 0.3*36.00 + 0.7*34.56 = 35.112\n        Hour 10: 0.3*35.26 + 0.7*33.63 = 34.179\n        Hour 11: 0.3*34.85 + 0.7*33.37 = 33.874\n        Hour 12: 0.3*35.02 + 0.7*33.83 = 34.247\n        Hour 13: 0.3*35.23 + 0.7*33.90 = 34.419\n        Hour 14: 0.3*35.28 + 0.7*34.12 = 34.468\n        Hour 15: 0.3*35.74 + 0.7*35.07 = 35.241\n        Hour 16: 0.3*36.28 + 0.7*35.56 = 35.776\n        Hour 17: 0.3*36.28 + 0.7*35.53 = 35.695\n        Hour 18: 0.3*35.77 + 0.7*34.20 = 34.671\n        Hour 19: 0.3*34.31 + 0.7*32.94 = 33.351\n        Hour 20: 0.3*33.67 + 0.7*32.40 = 32.781\n        Hour 21: 0.3*32.88 + 0.7*31.99 = 32.257\n        Hour 22: 0.3*31.84 + 0.7*31.46 = 31.574\n        Hour 23: 0.3*31.07 + 0.7*30.54 = 30.699\n\n    But note: the previous Tuesday (13th) at hour 15:00 was 35.74, and the Monday (19th) at hour 15:00 was 35.07 -> we have 35.241, which is between.\n\n    However, we note that the previous Tuesday (13th) had a relatively low peak compared to the following weekdays (14th,15th,16th). So we might be underestimating? But the Monday (19th) was also lower than the previous weekdays. \n\n    Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was the first day of the week and the market might have been different, we stick to our method.\n\n    We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n    Therefore, the forecast for 2016-12-20 00:00 to 2016-12-20 23:00:\n\n        2016/12/20 0:00: 30.68\n        2016/12/20 1:00: 30.33\n        2016/12/20 2:00: 30.24\n        2016/12/20 3:00: 30.31\n        2016/12/20 4:00: 30.79\n        2016/12/20 5:00: 31.53\n        2016/12/20 6:00: 33.21\n        2016/12/20 7:00: 36.29\n        2016/12/20 8:00: 37.05\n        2016/12/20 9:00: 35.11\n        2016/12/20 10:00: 34.18\n        2016/12/20 11:00: 33.87\n        2016/12/20 12:00: 34.25\n        2016/12/20 13:00: 34.42\n        2016/12/20 14:00: 34.47\n        2016/12/20 15:00: 35.24\n        2016/12/20 16:00: 35.78\n        2016/12/20 17:00: 35.70\n        2016/12/20 18:00: 34.67\n        2016/12/20 19:00: 33.35\n        2016/12/20 20:00: 32.78\n        2016/12/20 21:00: 32.26\n        2016/12/20 22:00: 31.57\n        2016/12/20 23:00: 30.70\n\n    But note: the date format in the input uses a space between date and time, and the date is in the format \"YYYY/MM/DD\". We'll use the same.\n\n    We output the forecast for the next 24 hours in the same structure.\n\n    However, we note that the input data for the last day is 2016/12/19 23:00, so the next day is 2016/12/20.\n\n    We write:\n\n        2016/12/20 0:00 30.68\n        2016/12/20 1:00 30.33\n        ... \n\n    We must output exactly 24 hours.\n\n    Let's write the full list.\n\n    But note: the input uses a space between the date and the time, and the time is written as \"0:00\", \"1:00\", etc.\n\n    We'll do the same.\n\n    We'll output the forecast in the same format.\n\n    However, we note that the input has the hour without leading zero for the hour? It uses \"0:00\", not \"00:00\".
