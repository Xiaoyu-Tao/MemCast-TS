        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2013-07-16 00:00 to 2013-07-22 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2013-07-23 00:00 to 2013-07-23 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we know that electricity prices exhibit:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - Weekly seasonality (though less pronounced in this short span, but we have 7 days of data)\n\n However, note that the data provided is for 7 consecutive days (from 2013-07-16 to 2013-07-22). We are to forecast the next day (2013-07-23).\n\n We can use a simple seasonal naive approach, but that might not capture trends. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour of the previous days, or exponential smoothing.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data (and no external libraries or complex models), we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days (if we believe in weekly pattern) or for the last few days.\n\n However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n\n Option 2: Use a moving window of the same hour for the last few days. Since we have 7 days, we can take the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n But let's observe: the next day is a Tuesday (2013-07-23). The same day of the week in the past was Tuesday (2013-07-16). However, we have data from Tuesday (2013-07-16) to Monday (2013-07-22). So for the next Tuesday (2013-07-23) we can use:\n\n   - The same hour of the previous day (Monday, 2013-07-22)\n   - The same hour of the same day last week (Tuesday, 2013-07-16)\n   - Or an average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n However, we note that the data does not exactly repeat. We can see a trend? Let's look at the last week:\n\n   - The week starts on Tuesday (2013-07-16) and ends on Monday (2013-07-22). \n\n We can see that the prices on Monday (2013-07-22) were generally higher than on the previous Tuesday (2013-07-16). \n\n Therefore, a simple method is to use the same hour of the previous day (Monday) as the same hour of the same day last week (Tuesday) and take an average? Or we can use a weighted average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a method that accounts for the recent trend. \n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to act as an expert, I choose a method that has been shown to be effective for short-term forecasting: the Seasonal Naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours. However, the pure naive would just use the same hour from the previous day. But we can also consider the average of the last two days for the same hour? \n\n Let me try:\n\n   Forecast for 2013-07-23 00:00: \n        = (value at 2013-07-22 00:00 + value at 2013-07-21 00:00 + value at 2013-07-20 00:00) / 3   [using last 3 days]\n\n But note: the data shows that the price at 00:00 has been:\n   2013-07-16 00:00: 32.80\n   2013-07-17 00:00: 34.68\n   2013-07-18 00:00: 34.32\n   2013-07-19 00:00: 34.18\n   2013-07-20 00:00: 34.92\n   2013-07-21 00:00: 34.30\n   2013-07-22 00:00: 34.71\n\n We see a slight variation. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? \n\n   Forecast for 2013-07-23 00:00 = (32.80 + 34.68 + 34.32 + 34.18 + 34.92 + 34.30 + 34.71) / 7\n\n But note: the problem says we are to forecast the next 24 hours. We must do this for each hour.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data might have a weekly pattern? But we only have one week of data. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which are the most recent) to capture the recent trend. \n\n Let me compare the two:\n\n   Using last 7 days: \n        It would be the average of the entire week, which might be too smooth and not capture recent changes.\n\n   Using last 3 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday? Actually, the last three days are: Sunday (2013-07-21), Monday (2013-07-22), and Saturday (2013-07-20)? \n\n Actually, the last three days in the data are:\n        Sunday: 2013-07-21\n        Monday: 2013-07-22\n        and the day before Sunday is Saturday: 2013-07-20\n\n But note: the day of the week might matter. However, we are forecasting a Tuesday. The last three same hours are from Saturday, Sunday, Monday. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) and the previous day (Monday) and take an average? \n\n   Forecast for 2013-07-23 00:00 = (value of 2013-07-16 00:00 + value of 2013-07-22 00:00) / 2\n\n But that would be: (32.80 + 34.71) / 2 = 33.755\n\n However, we note that the price on the same day (Monday) was 34.71 and the same day last week (Tuesday) was 32.80. The recent Monday was higher. \n\n Considering the upward trend in the base level? \n\n Given the complexity and without more data, I propose to use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for forecasting the next day (Tuesday). \n\n Why 3 days? Because it captures the most recent pattern and is less volatile than using just one day.\n\n So for each hour h (0 to 23) of 2013-07-23:\n\n   Forecast(h) = ( Price on 2013-07-22 at h + Price on 2013-07-21 at h + Price on 2013-07-20 at h ) / 3\n\n Let's calculate for hour 0: \n   2013-07-20 00:00: 34.92\n   2013-07-21 00:00: 34.30\n   2013-07-22 00:00: 34.71\n   Average = (34.92 + 34.30 + 34.71) / 3 = 103.93 / 3 = 34.64333 -> round to 2 decimals: 34.64\n\n Similarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the data provided has two decimal places. We will round to two decimals.\n\n But wait: is this the best? We note that the prices on weekdays might be different from weekends. The day we are forecasting is a Tuesday (2013-07-23). The last three days we are using are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So we are mixing weekend and weekday. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) and the two weekdays before the forecast day? But we don't have data for Tuesday of the previous week and then we have Monday and Sunday? \n\n Since we are limited by the data, and the fact that we are to use only the provided data, I will stick to the last 3 days (which are the most recent) to capture the immediate pattern.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2013-07-23 00:00 to 2013-07-23 23:00) using the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (2013-07-20, 2013-07-21, 2013-07-22).\n\n Steps:\n\n   For hour 0: \n        h0 = (2013-07-20 0:00, 2013-07-21 0:00, 2013-07-22 0:00) -> (34.92, 34.30, 34.71) -> 34.64\n\n   For hour 1:\n        h1 = (2013-07-20 1:00: 33.10, 2013-07-21 1:00: 33.18, 2013-07-22 1:00: 33.04) -> (33.10+33.18+33.04)/3 = 99.32/3 = 33.11\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the data for the last three days:\n\n   Day 1: 2013-07-20 (Saturday) \n   Day 2: 2013-07-21 (Sunday)\n   Day 3: 2013-07-22 (Monday)\n\n We are forecasting for 2013-07-23 (Tuesday). \n\n Let's compute the entire forecast:\n\n Hour 0: (34.92 + 34.30 + 34.71) / 3 = 103.93 / 3 = 34.64333 -> 34.64\n Hour 1: (33.10 + 33.18 + 33.04) / 3 = 99.32 / 3 = 33.10667 -> 33.11\n Hour 2: (32.67 + 32.90 + 32.59) / 3 = 98.16 / 3 = 32.72\n Hour 3: (32.02 + 32.21 + 31.97) / 3 = 96.20 / 3 = 32.06667 -> 32.07\n Hour 4: (31.82 + 31.16 + 31.79) / 3 = 94.77 / 3 = 31.59\n Hour 5: (31.93 + 29.90 + 33.09) / 3 = 94.92 / 3 = 31.64\n Hour 6: (33.09 + 30.98 + 36.16) / 3 = 100.23 / 3 = 33.41\n Hour 7: (34.86 + 32.31 + 36.86) / 3 = 104.03 / 3 = 34.67667 -> 34.68\n Hour 8: (35.31 + 33.08 + 38.28) / 3 = 106.67 / 3 = 35.55667 -> 35.56\n Hour 9: (35.59 + 34.42 + 38.63) / 3 = 108.64 / 3 = 36.21333 -> 36.21\n Hour 10: (35.19 + 35.01 + 38.86) / 3 = 109.06 / 3 = 36.35333 -> 36.35\n Hour 11: (35.24 + 35.17 + 38.45) / 3 = 108.86 / 3 = 36.28667 -> 36.29\n Hour 12: (35.07 + 35.11 + 38.32) / 3 = 108.50 / 3 = 36.16667 -> 36.17\n Hour 13: (34.67 + 35.05 + 38.23) / 3 = 107.95 / 3 = 35.98333 -> 35.98\n Hour 14: (34.29 + 34.92 + 38.01) / 3 = 107.22 / 3 = 35.74\n Hour 15: (34.04 + 34.76 + 37.92) / 3 = 106.72 / 3 = 35.57333 -> 35.57\n Hour 16: (34.27 + 34.53 + 37.62) / 3 = 106.42 / 3 = 35.47333 -> 35.47\n Hour 17: (34.62 + 34.91 + 37.52) / 3 = 107.05 / 3 = 35.68333 -> 35.68\n Hour 18: (35.41 + 35.13 + 37.90) / 3 = 108.44 / 3 = 36.14667 -> 36.15\n Hour 19: (35.91 + 35.22 + 37.43) / 3 = 108.56 / 3 = 36.18667 -> 36.19\n Hour 20: (35.48 + 35.99 + 36.99) / 3 = 108.46 / 3 = 36.15333 -> 36.15\n Hour 21: (35.15 + 36.65 + 37.06) / 3 = 108.86 / 3 = 36.28667 -> 36.29\n Hour 22: (35.86 + 36.92 + 36.97) / 3 = 109.75 / 3 = 36.58333 -> 36.58\n Hour 23: (34.57 + 35.64 + 36.56) / 3 = 106.77 / 3 = 35.59\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2013-07-23 from 00:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n 00:00: 34.64\n 01:00: 33.11\n 02:00: 32.72\n 03:00: 32.07\n 04:00: 31.59\n 05:00: 31.64\n 06:00: 33.41\n 07:00: 34.68\n 08:00: 35.56\n 09:00: 36.21\n 10:00: 36.35\n 11:00: 36.29\n 12:00: 36.17\n 13:00: 35.98\n 14:00: 35.74\n 15:00: 35.57\n 16:00: 35.47\n 17:00: 35.68\n 18:00: 36.15\n 19:00: 36.19\n 20:00: 36.15\n 21:00: 36.29\n 22:00: 36.58\n 23:00: 35.59\n\n We must output the forecast in the same format as the input, but for the next 24 hours starting from 2013-07-23 00:00.\n\n Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2013/7/23 0:00 [forecast_value]\n        2013/7/23 1:00 [forecast_value]\n        ...\n        2013/7/23 23:00 [forecast_value]\n        </answer>\n\n Note: The date format in the input uses a single digit for the month (7) and day (23).
