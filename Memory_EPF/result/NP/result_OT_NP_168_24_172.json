        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/4/19 0:00 to 2016/4/25 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016/4/26 0:00 to 2016/4/26 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only given the observed prices (OT), we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values in the provided data. The data provided seems complete (168 entries for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values in the given history.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the nature of electricity prices (strong daily and weekly seasonality), we can use a seasonal naive method or a simple averaging of the same hours of the last few days.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - Weekdays (Mon-Fri) typically have higher prices during the day and lower at night.\n   - Weekends (Sat-Sun) have lower and more stable prices.\n\n The last day in the historical data is Monday (2016/4/25). We are to forecast Tuesday (2016/4/26).\n\n Approach:\n We can use the average of the same hour of the previous Tuesdays in the available data? But we only have one week of data? Actually, we have:\n   - Tuesday: 2016/4/19 (but note 4/19 is a Tuesday? Let's check: 2016/4/19 is a Tuesday? Actually, 2016/4/25 is a Monday, so 2016/4/19 was a Tuesday? Yes, because 4/18 would have been Monday and 4/19 Tuesday.\n\n But we only have one Tuesday (2016/4/19) and then the next Tuesday would be 2016/4/26? Actually, we have:\n   - Tuesday: 2016/4/19\n   - Then the next Tuesday is 2016/4/26 (which is the forecast day).\n\n However, we also have the day of the week for the other days. We can also consider the pattern of the most recent days.\n\n Since we have only one week of data, we cannot average multiple Tuesdays. Therefore, we can consider:\n\n Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2016/4/19) as the forecast for 2016/4/26? But note that was a week ago and the market conditions might have changed.\n\n Option 2: Use a moving window of the last few days (e.g., the last 3 days) and average the same hour. But note the last 3 days include Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. The forecast day is Tuesday, which is a weekday. So we might adjust by giving more weight to weekdays.\n\n However, the data shows that Monday (2016/4/25) had a significant price spike in the morning (up to 33.58) which was not present in the previous week's Tuesday. So we must be cautious.\n\n Given the complexity and without additional data (like load and wind forecasts), we can use a hybrid approach:\n\n  - For each hour of the day (0 to 23) on the forecast day (Tuesday 2016/4/26), we take the average of:\n        - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016/4/19)\n        - The same hour from the most recent weekday (Monday 2016/4/25) and also the same hour from the day before (Sunday 2016/4/24) and Saturday (2016/4/23) to capture the recent trend?\n\n  But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but there are none in the history. We are only given the price, so we cannot use other features.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing or an ARIMA model. However, without the ability to run complex models here, we go for a practical approach.\n\n  Proposed method:\n    We note that the price on Monday (2016/4/25) was significantly higher than the previous days. This might be due to the start of the work week. Since Tuesday is also a work day, we expect a similar pattern but perhaps slightly lower? \n\n  We can compute the day-of-week pattern from the available week:\n\n    Let's denote:\n        Monday: 2016/4/25 (high prices, especially in the morning)\n        Sunday: 2016/4/24 (moderate, with a peak in the evening)\n        Saturday: 2016/4/23 (moderate, with a peak in the evening)\n        Friday: 2016/4/22 (weekday, but we have data)\n\n    We can also the previous Tuesday (2016/4/19) which was a Tuesday.\n\n  We decide to use a weighted average of:\n      - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (weight 0.5)\n      - The same hour from the most recent Monday (weight 0.3)\n      - The same hour from the most recent Sunday (weight 0.1) and Saturday (weight 0.1) to adjust for the recent trend.\n\n  Why these weights? Because the same day of the week is the most relevant, then the immediate previous day (Monday) is also very relevant for a Tuesday. The weekend days are less relevant but might capture the recent trend.\n\n  However, note that the Monday (4/25) had an unusually high peak. We might want to smooth that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Friday, Monday, and the previous Tuesday) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 24 hours? \n\n  Let's calculate the average price for the last 24 hours (Monday 4/25) and compare to the average of the previous Tuesday (4/19) and the Monday of the previous week (which we don't have, so we skip).\n\n  Actually, we don't have the Monday of the previous week (4/18) in the data. So we only have one Tuesday and one Monday.\n\n  Considering the limitations, we do:\n\n      For hour h (0 to 23) on 2016/4/26:\n      forecast = (price_h of 2016/4/19 * 0.6) + (price_h of 2016/4/25 * 0.4)\n\n  Why 0.6 and 0.4? Because we want to give more weight to the same day of the week, but the recent day (Monday) is also very indicative for the next day (Tuesday). \n\n  However, we see that the Monday (4/25) had a spike that might not be repeated? But without more data, we stick to this.\n\n  But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values. There are none in the history, so we proceed.\n\n  However, let's check the data: \n      On 2016/4/19 (Tuesday): \n          0:00: 19.03,  On 2016/4/25 (Monday): \n          0:00: 22.31\n\n  Then for 2016/4/26 0:00: 0.6*19.03 + 0.4*22.31 = 20.342\n\n  But we also note that the price on Sunday (4/24) at 0:00 was 22.31? Actually, 4/24 0:00: 21.41? and 4/23 0:00: 21.44.\n\n  The recent nights have been around 21-22, so 20.342 might be a bit low? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three days for the same hour? \n\n  For 0:00: \n      Saturday (4/23): 21.44\n      Sunday (4/24): 21.41\n      Monday (4/25): 22.31\n      Average = (21.44+21.41+22.31)/3 = 21.72\n\n  Then we can take a blend: 0.5 * (previous Tuesday at 0:00) + 0.5 * (average of last three days at 0:00)\n      = 0.5*19.03 + 0.5*21.72 = 20.375\n\n  This is similar to the first method.\n\n  We can also consider the trend: the price on Monday was higher than the weekend, and the previous Tuesday was lower. We might expect a value in between.\n\n  We decide to use the average of the same hour for the previous Tuesday and the same hour for the last three days (with equal weight for each of the four points: previous Tuesday and the last three days). \n\n  So for each hour h:\n      forecast = (price_h_prev_tuesday + price_h_day_minus_3 + price_h_day_minus_2 + price_h_day_minus_1) / 4\n\n  Where:\n      prev_tuesday: 2016/4/19\n      day_minus_3: 2016/4/23 (Saturday, 3 days before 2016/4/26? Actually, 2016/4/26 is Tuesday, so:\n          day_minus_1: 2016/4/25 (Monday)\n          day_minus_2: 2016/4/24 (Sunday)\n          day_minus_3: 2016/4/23 (Saturday)\n\n  But note: the previous Tuesday (2016/4/19) is 7 days before, not 3. So we are mixing a weekly pattern and a recent pattern.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But we only have Monday (4/25) and Friday (4/22) as weekdays? and the previous Tuesday (4/19) is also a weekday.\n\n  We can do: \n      Weekday same hour: take the previous Tuesday (4/19) and the Monday (4/25) and Friday (4/22). Then average these three.\n\n  For 0:00:\n        Tuesday (4/19): 19.03\n        Friday (4/22): 21.44? Actually, 4/22 0:00: 19.65? \n        Monday (4/25): 22.31\n        Average = (19.03 + 19.65 + 22.31) / 3 = 20.33\n\n  This seems reasonable.\n\n  But note: the hour 0:00 on Saturday and Sunday are not weekdays, so we skip them? \n\n  So for each hour h, we take the average of the same hour on:\n        - The most recent weekday: Monday (4/25)\n        - The same weekday of the previous week: Tuesday (4/19)\n        - The last available same weekday? Actually, we don't have another Tuesday. So we use the Friday (4/22) as the last weekday before Monday? \n\n  However, Friday is a different day of the week. \n\n  Considering the above, we decide to use:\n\n      forecast_h = (price_h_prev_tuesday + price_h_last_weekday1 + price_h_last_weekday2) / 3\n\n  where last_weekday1 is Monday (4/25) and last_weekday2 is Friday (4/22). \n\n  But note: the pattern on Friday might be different from Tuesday? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the current Tuesday? \n\n  Without more data, we stick to the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday, the last Friday, and the last Monday.\n\n  Let's test for a few hours:\n\n      Hour 7:00 (morning peak):\n          Tuesday (4/19): 22.58\n          Friday (4/22): 23.04\n          Monday (4/25): 28.78\n          Average = (22.58+23.04+28.78)/3 = 24.80\n\n      Hour 15:00 (afternoon):\n          Tuesday (4/19): 20.40\n          Friday (4/22): 21.83\n          Monday (4/25): 23.74\n          Average = (20.40+21.83+23.74)/3 = 21.99\n\n  This seems plausible.\n\n  However, note that the Monday (4/25) had a very high peak at 7:00 (28.78) which might be an outlier? But we don't have evidence to remove it.\n\n  We will use this method for all 24 hours.\n\n  Steps for each hour h in 0..23:\n\n      h_prev_tue = value at hour h on 2016/4/19\n      h_fri = value at hour h on 2016/4/22\n      h_mon = value at hour h on 2016/4/25\n\n      forecast = (h_prev_tue + h_fri + h_mon) / 3\n\n  But note: the data for 2016/4/19, 2016/4/22, and 2016/4/25 are all available.\n\n  Let's generate the forecast for 2016/4/26 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n  We write the forecast for each hour:\n\n  Hour 0: (19.03 [4/19 0:00] + 19.65 [4/22 0:00] + 22.31 [4/25 0:00]) / 3 = (19.03+19.65+22.31)/3 = 60.99/3 = 20.33\n  Hour 1: (18.58 + 19.08 + 21.47) / 3 = (18.58+19.08+21.47)=59.13/3=19.71\n  Hour 2: (18.51 + 18.98 + 20.94) / 3 = (18.51+18.98+20.94)=58.43/3=19.4767 -> 19.48\n  Hour 3: (18.32 + 18.91 + 20.79) / 3 = (18.32+18.91+20.79)=58.02/3=19.34\n  Hour 4: (18.58 + 19.35 + 21.04) / 3 = (18.58+19.35+21.04)=58.97/3=19.6567 -> 19.66\n  Hour 5: (19.82 + 21.21 + 22.88) / 3 = (19.82+21.21+22.88)=63.91/3=21.3033 -> 21.30\n  Hour 6: (21.27 + 21.89 + 25.05) / 3 = (21.27+21.89+25.05)=68.21/3=22.7367 -> 22.74\n  Hour 7: (22.58 + 23.04 + 28.78) / 3 = (22.58+23.04+28.78)=74.4/3=24.80\n  Hour 8: (22.85 + 23.91 + 33.58) / 3 = (22.85+23.91+33.58)=80.34/3=26.78\n  Hour 9: (22.59 + 23.74 + 30.46) / 3 = (22.59+23.74+30.46)=76.79/3=25.5967 -> 25.60\n  Hour 10: (21.73 + 23.64 + 27.58) / 3 = (21.73+23.64+27.58)=72.95/3=24.3167 -> 24.32\n  Hour 11: (21.20 + 23.19 + 26.56) / 3 = (21.20+23.19+26.56)=70.95/3=23.65\n  Hour 12: (20.99 + 22.88 + 26.10) / 3 = (20.99+22.88+26.10)=69.97/3=23.3233 -> 23.32\n  Hour 13: (20.91 + 22.62 + 26.02) / 3 = (20.91+22.62+26.02)=69.55/3=23.1833 -> 23.18\n  Hour 14: (20.74 + 22.30 + 25.29) / 3 = (20.74+22.30+25.29)=68.33/3=22.7767 -> 22.78\n  Hour 15: (20.40 + 21.83 + 23.74) / 3 = (20.40+21.83+23.74)=65.97/3=21.99\n  Hour 16: (20.27 + 21.79 + 24.03) / 3 = (20.27+21.79+24.03)=66.09/3=22.03\n  Hour 17: (20.37 + 22.01 + 24.82) / 3 = (20.37+22.01+24.82)=67.20/3=22.40\n  Hour 18: (21.06 + 22.08 + 24.49) / 3 = (21.06+22.08+24.49)=67.63/3=22.5433 -> 22.54\n  Hour 19: (21.50 + 22.24 + 25.57) / 3 = (21.50+22.24+25.57)=69.31/3=23.1033 -> 23.10\n  Hour 20: (21.47 + 22.09 + 25.02) / 3 = (21.47+22.09+25.02)=68.58/3=22.86\n  Hour 21: (21.43 + 22.18 + 25.08) / 3 = (21.43+22.18+25.08)=68.69/3=22.8967 -> 22.90\n  Hour 22: (20.36 + 21.90 + 24.02) / 3 = (20.36+21.90+24.02)=66.28/3=22.0933 -> 22.09\n  Hour 23: (19.40 + 21.38 + 22.81) / 3 = (19.40+21.38+22.81)=63.59/3=21.1967 -> 21.20\n\n  We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n  Therefore, the forecast for 2016/4/26 from 0:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n  2016/4/26 0:00: 20.33\n  2016/4/26 1:00: 19.71\n  2016/4/26 2:00: 19.48\n  2016/4/26 3:00: 19.34\n  2016/4/26 4:00: 19.66\n  2016/4/26 5:00: 21.30\n  2016/4/26 6:00: 22.74\n  2016/4/26 7:00: 24.80\n  2016/4/26 8:00: 26.78\n  2016/4/26 9:00: 25.60\n  2016/4/26 10:00: 24.32\n  2016/4/26 11:00: 23.65\n  2016/4/26 12:00: 23.32\n  2016/4/26 13:00: 23.18\n  2016/4/26 14:00: 22.78\n  2016/4/26 15:00: 21.99\n  2016/4/26 16:00: 22.03\n  2016/4/26 17:00: 22.40\n  2016/4/26 18:00: 22.54\n  2016/4/26 19:00: 23.10\n  2016/4/26 20:00: 22.86\n  2016/4/26 21:00: 22.90\n  2016/4/26 22:00: 22.09\n  2016/4/26 23:00: 21.20\n\n  We output this in the required format.\n\n  Note: This is a simple heuristic.
