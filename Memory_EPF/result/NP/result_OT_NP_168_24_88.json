        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/9/9 0:00 to 2014/9/15 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/9/16 0:00 to 2014/9/16 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical price.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) and there are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily seasonality (24-hour cycles) and weekly patterns. Since we have exactly one week of data, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the requirement for a short-term forecast (24 hours) and the availability of only 168 points, we can use a simple but effective method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day or the same day of the previous week.\n    - However, we have exactly 7 days of data. We can use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But note that the pattern might change.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. But without additional features and with only 7 days, we might not have enough data to fit such a model robustly.\n\n 5. Another approach is to use a simple moving average of the same hour from the last few days. Since we have a week, we can use the same hour from the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) as a starting point and adjust with recent trends.\n\n 6. However, note that the last day (2014/9/15) shows a significant increase in prices compared to the previous days. This might be because it's pattern is different as it is a Monday? The previous days were weekend (13th and 14th are Saturday and Sunday, 15th is Monday). So we should account for the weekly pattern.\n\n 7. Considering the above, we can use:\n    - For each hour of the day (0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00) in the forecast (which is for 2014/9/16, a Tuesday), we look at the same hour on the previous Tuesday (which is 2014/9/9) and then adjust by the trend observed between the last two days (Monday 15th and Sunday 14th) for that hour.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour over the last 7 days and then adjust by the recent day-over-day change.\n\n 9. But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (though there are none) and provide a complete forecast.\n\n 10. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from the last 7 days, with more weight on the most recent days and the same day of the previous week.\n\n 11. However, a more robust method is to use the following:\n      Forecast for hour h on day d = (value of hour h on day d-7) * (recent trend factor)\n\n 12. How to compute the recent trend factor? We can compute the average price of the last day (2014/9/15) and the average price of the day before (2014/9/14) and then the ratio (or difference) to capture the trend.\n\n      Let:\n        Avg_15 = average of 2014/9/15 = (32.63+32.45+32.14+32.19+32.76+33.63+36.41+38.78+40.28+39.87+39.74+38.95+38.20+37.89+37.43+37.36+37.25+37.61+37.82+38.39+37.87+37.01+34.45+33.38) / 24\n        = 36.15 (approx)\n\n        Avg_14 = average of 2014/9/14 = (33.18+32.70+31.95+32.18+32.22+32.11+32.51+32.63+33.37+33.73+34.29+34.65+34.16+33.83+33.74+33.69+33.81+34.03+34.61+36.03+36.88+35.17+33.96+33.14) / 24\n        = 33.60 (approx)\n\n        Trend factor (as a ratio) = Avg_15 / Avg_14 = 36.15 / 33.60 \u2248 1.0759\n\n      Then, for each hour h (0 to 23) on 2014/9/16, we take the value of the same hour on 2014/9/9 (which is the same day of the previous week) and multiply by 1.0759.\n\n 13. But note: 2014/9/9 was a Tuesday? Actually, 2014/9/15 is a Monday, so 2014/9/16 is a Tuesday. The same day of the previous week for 2014/9/16 is 2014/9/9 (which was a Tuesday).\n\n 14. However, we must check if the data for 2014/9/9 is available? Yes, it is the first 24 hours of the provided data.\n\n 15. But the problem: the entire week might have a trend? We can also consider the trend from the same day last week to the current week? \n\n      Alternatively, we can compute the trend factor for each hour? \n\n      Let F_h = (value of hour h on 2014/9/15) / (value of hour h on 2014/9/8) ... but we don't have 2014/9/8.\n\n 16. Since we only have 7 days (from 9/9 to 9/15), we cannot go back to 9/8. Therefore, we use the overall trend factor as above.\n\n 17. Steps for each hour h (0 to 23) for hour h:\n      base_value = OT value at hour h on 2014/9/9\n      forecast = base_value * (Avg_15 / Avg_14)\n\n 18. But wait, the day 2014/9/9 was the first day and we don't have the day before that. Also, the overall trend factor might be too simplistic.\n\n 19. Another approach: use the same hour from the previous day (2014/9/15) and adjust by the change from the same day of the previous week (2014/9/9) to the day before (2014/9/15) for that hour? \n\n      Let:\n        change_factor_h = (value at hour h on 2014/9/15) / (value at hour h on 2014/9/9)\n\n      Then, for the next day (2014/9/16) at hour h, we use:\n        forecast = (value at hour h on 2014/9/15) * change_factor_h\n\n      But that would be (value at hour h on 2014/9/15)^2 / (value at hour h on 2014/9/9) ... which might be too extreme.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from the last few days and the same day last week.\n\n 21. Given the time and simplicity, and that we are only allowed to use the provided data, I choose to use the method in step 12 and 15: using the same hour from the same day last week (2014/9/9) and scaling by the overall trend (Avg_15 / Avg_14).\n\n 22. But note: the day 2014/9/14 was a Sunday and 2014/9/15 was a Monday, while 2014/9/9 was a Tuesday and 2014/9/16 is a Tuesday. The trend factor we computed is from Sunday to Monday, which might not be the same as the trend from Monday to Tuesday.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we can compute the trend from the same day last week (Tuesday 9/9) to the most recent day (Monday 9/15) and then apply that to the same day last week to get the forecast for the next Tuesday? \n\n      Let overall_trend = (Avg_15) / (average of 2014/9/9) \n\n      Average of 2014/9/9: \n        (32.00+31.30+30.93+31.03+31.77+32.78+34.82+36.61+36.90+36.91+36.86+36.43+35.85+35.50+35.35+34.64+34.40+34.95+35.18+36.06+36.31+35.10+33.82+32.79) / 24\n        = 34.33 (approx)\n\n      Then overall_trend = 36.15 / 34.33 \u2248 1.053\n\n      Then for each hour h, forecast = (value at hour h on 2014/9/9) * 1.053\n\n 24. But note: the day of the week effect: we are comparing Tuesday (9/9) to Monday (9/15) and then using that to forecast Tuesday (9/16). This might not be ideal because Monday and Tuesday can have different patterns.\n\n 25. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for the same hour? But then we lose the weekly pattern.\n\n 26. Considering the trade-offs, I will use the same hour from the previous week (2014/9/9) and adjust by the average change from the previous week to the current week for the same day type? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n 27. Given the constraints, I propose to use a combination of the same day last week and the most recent day (yesterday) with a weight. For example:\n\n      forecast_h = 0.5 * (value_h_last_week) + 0.5 * (value_h_yesterday) \n\n      But note: yesterday (Monday) and the day we are forecasting (Tuesday) are different.\n\n 28. Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the same day of the week (Tuesday) from last week and the same hour from yesterday (Monday) and then take an average? But again, Monday and Tuesday are different.\n\n 29. Since we have only one week of data, we can also look at the day-to-day change from Monday to Tuesday in the previous week? \n\n      In the previous week:\n        Monday: we don't have (because our data starts on Tuesday 9/9)\n        Tuesday 9/9: average 34.33\n        Wednesday 9/10: average = (32.17+31.53+31.33+31.27+31.73+32.88+34.68+36.92+37.58+37.02+36.96+36.84+36.48+36.28+35.63+35.20+35.03+35.39+35.44+35.79+35.99+34.98+33.89+32.75)/24 = 34.75\n        So the change from Tuesday to Wednesday was 34.75/34.33 \u2248 1.012\n\n      Then we can assume that the change from Monday (9/15) to Tuesday (9/16) will be similar? So we take the average of Monday (36.15) and multiply by 1.012? \n\n      Then the average for Tuesday would be 36.15 * 1.012 = 36.59, and then distribute the same pattern as the previous Tuesday (9/9) relative to its average.\n\n      For each hour h:\n        base = (value at hour h on 2014/9/9) / 34.33   (normalized by the average of that day)\n        then forecast_h = base * 36.59\n\n 30. This method preserves the intraday pattern of the last Tuesday and scales it to the expected average of the coming Tuesday.\n\n 31. Steps for method 29:\n\n      Step 1: Compute the average_9 = 34.33 (for 2014/9/9)\n      Step 2: Compute the average_15 = 36.15 (for 2014/9/15, Monday)\n      Step 3: Compute the ratio of the next day (Wednesday) to Tuesday in the previous week: \n          average_10 (Wednesday 9/10) = 34.75\n          ratio_prev = average_10 / average_9 = 34.75 / 34.33 \u2248 1.012\n      Step 4: Then the forecasted average for Tuesday 9/16 = average_15 * ratio_prev = 36.15 * 1.012 \u2248 36.59\n\n      Step 5: For each hour h (0 to 23) on 2014/9/9, compute the normalized_value = (value_h_9) / 34.33\n      Step 6: Then forecast_h = normalized_value * 36.59\n\n 32. Let's test with one hour: \n        h=0 on 9/9: 32.00 -> normalized = 32.00/34.33 \u2248 0.932\n        then forecast for h=0 on 9/16: 0.932 * 36.59 \u2248 34.10\n\n 33. But note: the actual hour might have a different behavior? This method preserves the shape of the previous Tuesday.\n\n 34. However, we must consider that the recent day (Monday) had a different pattern? But we are using the relative pattern of the same day last week and scaling to the expected average.\n\n 35. This method is reasonable.\n\n 36. Let's compute the averages more accurately:\n\n      For 2014/9/9:\n        Sum = 32.00+31.30+30.93+31.03+31.77+32.78+34.82+36.61+36.90+36.91+36.86+36.43+35.85+35.50+35.35+34.64+34.40+34.95+35.18+36.06+36.31+35.10+33.82+32.79\n        = 824.00\n        Average = 824.00 / 24 = 34.333333\n\n      For 2014/9/10 (Wednesday):\n        Sum = 32.17+31.53+31.33+31.27+31.73+32.88+34.68+36.92+37.58+37.02+36.96+36.84+36.48+36.28+35.63+35.20+35.03+35.39+35.44+35.79+35.99+34.98+33.89+32.75\n        = 834.00\n        Average = 834.00 / 24 = 34.75\n\n      For 2014/9/15 (Monday):\n        Sum = 32.63+32.45+32.14+32.19+32.76+33.63+36.41+38.78+40.28+39.87+39.74+38.95+38.20+37.89+37.43+37.36+37.25+37.61+37.82+38.39+37.87+37.01+34.45+33.38\n        = 867.64\n        Average = 867.64 / 24 = 36.1516667\n\n      Then ratio_prev = 34.75 / 34.333333 \u2248 1.01212\n\n      Forecasted average for 2014/9/16 = 36.1516667 * 1.01212 \u2248 36.59 (we'll compute exactly: 36.1516667 * 1.01212 = 36.59)\n\n 37. Now, for each hour h in 0..23:\n\n        normalized_h = (value of hour h on 9/9) / 34.333333\n        forecast_h = normalized_h * 36.59\n\n 38. But note: 36.59 is the forecasted average for the day. We are scaling the entire day of 9/9 by (36.59 / 34.333333) which is about 1.0657.\n\n      So we can also do: forecast_h = (value of hour h on 9/9) * (36.59 / 34.333333)\n\n 39. Let me compute the scaling factor: 36.59 / 34.333333 \u2248 1.0657\n\n 40. Therefore, for each hour, we take the value from 2014/9/9 and multiply by 1.0657.\n\n 41. But wait, we computed the forecasted average as 36.59, and the scaling factor is 36.59 / 34.333333 = 1.0657. So:\n\n        forecast_h = value_9_9_h * 1.0657\n\n 42. Let's compute the first hour (0:00) of 2014/9/16:\n\n        value_9_9_0:00 = 32.00\n        forecast_0:00 = 32.00 * 1.0657 \u2248 34.1024\n\n 43. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 44. However, note that the day 9/9 was a Tuesday and we are forecasting a Tuesday, so the pattern should be similar.\n\n 45. But we must consider that the actual data might have changed over the week? This method is a simple scaling.\n\n 46. Given the simplicity and the constraints, we use this method.\n\n 47. Compute the scaling factor exactly:\n\n        scaling_factor = (36.1516667 * (34.75 / 34.333333)) / 34.333333   ??? \n\n      Actually, we have:\n\n        forecasted_daily_avg = 36.1516667 * (34.75 / 34.333333) \n        = 36.1516667 * 1.01212 = 36.59 (approx)\n\n        Then scaling_factor = forecasted_daily_avg / (average of 9/9) = 36.59 / 34.333333 = 1.0657\n\n      Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        scaling_factor = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / (34.333333 * 34.333333)\n\n      But that is not necessary. We can compute:\n\n        scaling_factor = (36.1516667 / 34.333333) * (34.75 / 34.333333)  -> no, that's not the same.\n\n 48. Let me clarify:\n\n        We defined: \n          forecasted_daily_avg = (average_15) * (average_10 / average_9)\n          = 36.1516667 * (34.75 / 34.333333) \n\n        Then for each hour, we want to scale the relative value of that hour in 9/9 to the new average.\n\n        So: forecast_h = (value_9_9_h / average_9) * forecasted_daily_avg\n                   = value_9_9_h * (forecasted_daily_avg / average_9)\n                   = value_9_9_h * [ (36.1516667 * (34.75 / 34.333333)) / 34.333333 ]\n\n        But note: 34.75 / 34.333333 is about 1.01212, and then multiplied by 36.1516667 gives 36.59, then divided by 34.333333 gives 1.0657.\n\n 49. Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n        scaling_factor = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / (34.333333 * 34.333333)\n\n        But that is not the same as 36.59 / 34.333333.\n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n          forecasted_daily_avg = 36.1516667 * (34.75 / 34.333333) \n          = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / 34.333333\n\n        Then scaling_factor = forecasted_daily_avg / average_9 = [ (36.1516667 * 34.75) / 34.333333 ] / 34.333333\n                            = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / (34.333333^2)\n\n        This is different.\n\n 50. Let me recast: we want to preserve the intraday pattern of the base Tuesday (9/9). The base Tuesday had an average of 34.333333. We are forecasting a Tuesday that we expect to have an average of 36.59. Therefore, we scale each hour by (36.59 / 34.333333).\n\n        So scaling_factor = 36.59 / 34.333333\n\n        But 36.59 is computed as 36.1516667 * (34.75 / 34.333333) = 36.1516667 * 1.01212 = 36.59 (rounded).\n\n        We can compute 36.59 more accurately:\n\n          36.1516667 * 34.75 = 1256.27\n          1256.27 / 34.333333 \u2248 36.59   (exactly: 1256.27 / 34.333333 = 36.59)\n\n        Actually, 34.333333 * 1.01212 = 34.75? \n\n        Let me compute: 34.333333 * 1.01212 = 34.75? \n\n        34.333333 * 1.01212 = 34.333333 * (1 + 0.01212) = 34.333333 + 34.333333*0.01212 \n        = 34.333333 + 0.416 = 34.749333 -> approximately 34.75.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n          scaling_factor = (36.1516667 * 34.75 / 34.333333) / 34.333333\n          = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / (34.333333^2)\n\n        But note: 34.333333^2 = 1178.777, and 36.1516667 * 34.75 = 1256.27, then 1256.27 / 1178.777 \u2248 1.0657.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n          scaling_factor = (36.1516667 / 34.333333) * (34.75 / 34.333333) \n          = (1.0529) * (1.01212) = 1.0657\n\n        So it's the same.\n\n 51. Therefore, we use scaling_factor = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / (34.333333 * 34.333333) \n\n        numerator = 36.1516667 * 34.75 = 1256.27\n        denominator = 34.333333 * 34.333333 = 1178.777\n        scaling_factor = 1256.27 / 1178.777 = 1.0657\n\n 52. But note: we can avoid this by doing:\n\n        scaling_factor = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / (34.333333 * 34.333333) \n        = (36.1516667 / 34.333333) * (34.75 / 34.333333)\n\n        However, we can compute it as:\n\n        scaling_factor = (36.1516667 * 34.75) / (34.333333 * 34.333333) \n\n        But we don't need to, because we already have:\n\n          forecasted_daily_avg = 36.1516667 * (34.75 / 34.333333) \n          = 36.1516667 * 1.01212 = 36.59\n\n        and then scaling_factor = 36.59 / 34.333333 = 1.0657\n\n 53. Therefore, we will use:\n\n        scaling_factor = 36.59 / 34.333333 = 1.0657\n\n 54. But to be precise, let's use the exact numbers:\n\n        average_9 = 824.00 / 24 = 34.3333333333\n        average_10 = 834.00 / 24 = 34.75\n        average_15 = 867.64 / 24 = 36.1516666667\n\n        forecasted_avg = 36.1516666667 * (34.75 / 34.3333333333) \n        = 36.1516666667 * (834.00/24) / (824.00/24) \n        = 36.1516666667 * (834.00 / 824.00)\n        = 36.1516666667 * 1.01213592233\n        = 36.59   (exactly: 36.1516666667 * 1.01213592233 = 36.59) \n\n        Then scaling_factor = 36.59 / 34.3333333333 = 36.59 / (824.00/24) = 36.59 * 24/824 = ?\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid rounding by:\n\n          scaling_factor = (36.1516666667 * 834.00 / 824.00) / (824.00/24) * (24/24) \n          = (36.1516666667 * 834.00 * 24) / (824.00 * 824.00)\n\n        But that is complicated.\n\n 55. We'll compute the forecast for each hour as:\n\n        forecast_h = value_9_9_h * (36.1516666667 * 834.00 / 824.00) / (824.00/24) * (1/24) ??? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n          forecasted_avg = (36.1516666667 * 834.00) / 824.00\n\n          and average_9 = 824.00/24\n\n          so scaling_factor = forecasted_avg / average_9 = [ (36.1516666667 * 834.00) / 824.00 ] / (824.00/24)\n                            = (36.1516666667 * 834.00 * 24) / (824.00 * 824.00)\n\n        Let me compute:\n\n          numerator = 36.1516666667 * 834 * 24\n          denominator = 824 * 824\n\n        But we can do:\n\n          scaling_factor = (36.1516666667 * 834.00 * 24) / (824.00 * 824.00)\n\n        = (36.1516666667 * 834 * 24) / (824^2)\n\n        Let me compute step by step:\n\n          824^2 = 678976\n\n          36.1516666667 * 834 = 36.1516666667 * 800 + 36.1516666667 * 34 = 28921.33333336 + 1229.1566666678 = 30150.49\n\n          30150.49 * 24 = 723611.76\n\n          scaling_factor = 723611.76 / 678976 \u2248 1.0657\n\n 56. Therefore, we use scaling_factor = 1.0657\n\n 57. Now, we apply this scaling factor to each of the 24 hours of 2014/9/9.\n\n 58.

We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 60. Therefore, the forecast for 2014/9/16:\n\n        0:00: 34.10\n        1:00: 33.36\n        2:00: 32.96\n        3:00: 33.07\n        4:00: 33.86\n        5:00: 34.93\n        6:00: 37.11\n        7:00: 39.02\n        8:00: 39.32\n        9:00: 39.34\n        10:00: 39.28\n        11:00: 38.83\n        12:00: 38.21\n        13:00: 37.83\n        14:00: 37.67\n        15:00: 36.92\n        16:00: 36.66\n        17:00: 37.26\n        18:00: 37.49\n        19:00: 38.44\n        20:00: 38.70\n        21:00: 37.41\n        22:00: 36.05\n        23:00: 34.94\n\n 61. But note: the input data had two decimal places, so we output two decimal places.\n\n 62. However, we must consider that this is a simple method and might not capture recent changes. But given the data, it is a reasonable approach.\n\n 63. We output the forecast for 2014/9/16 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 64.
