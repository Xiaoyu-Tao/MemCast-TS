        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/4/14 0:00 to 2015/4/20 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015/4/21 0:00 to 2015/4/21 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on a time series model.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) without any missing values. So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows:\n    - Daily pattern: prices are lower at night and early morning, then rise during the morning peak, and drop in the evening and night.\n    - Weekly pattern: weekdays (Mon-Fri) have higher prices than weekends (Sat-Sun). The last day in the data (2015/4/20) is a Monday, and the next day (2015/4/21) is a Tuesday.\n\n 3. We can use a model that captures seasonality. Since we are only using the target variable (OT), we can use a seasonal naive method, or more sophisticated models like SARIMA or exponential smoothing. However, without the ability to run complex model fitting here, we can use a simple approach:\n\n    Option: Use the average of the same hour from the previous days, but we must account for the weekly pattern.\n\n    Since we have 7 days of data, we can compute the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But note: we are forecasting a Tuesday. We have two Tuesdays in the data? Actually, the data starts on a Tuesday (2015/4/14) and ends on a Monday (2015/4/20). So we have:\n    - 2015/4/14: Tuesday\n    - 2015/4/15: Wednesday\n    - 2015/4/16: Thursday\n    - 2015/4/17: Friday\n    - 2015/4/18: Saturday\n    - 2015/4/19: Sunday\n    - 2015/4/20: Monday\n\n We are forecasting 2015/4/21: Tuesday.\n\n We have only one Tuesday in the data (2015/4/14). So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n Alternative: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust by the typical difference between Monday and Tuesday? But we don't have multiple weeks.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last week (7 days) and then adjust for the day of the week effect? But we have only one week.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - The same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2015/4/20) as a base, but we note that Tuesday might be different from Monday.\n   - Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the same day of the week (i.e., the previous Tuesday, 2015/4/14) and adjust by the overall trend.\n\n However, we note that the prices on 2015/4/14 (Tuesday) and 2015/4/20 (Monday) are different. We can compute the average change from Monday to Tuesday? But we don't have multiple weeks.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have only one week of data, we can use:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on Tuesday (2015/4/21) = \n        (Price at hour h on the previous Tuesday (2015/4/14)) * (Average price of the last day (2015/4/20) / Average price of the previous Tuesday (2015/4/14))\n\n This is a simple ratio-based adjustment.\n\n Steps for this method:\n   a. Compute the average price for the previous Tuesday (2015/4/14): \n        avg_prev_tuesday = average of 24 hours on 2015/4/14.\n\n   b. Compute the average price for the last day (2015/4/20, Monday): \n        avg_last_day = average of 24 hours on 2015/4/20.\n\n   c. For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2015/4/21, Tuesday):\n        forecast_h = (price at hour h on 2015/4/14) * (avg_last_day / avg_prev_tuesday)\n\n Why this method? It scales the previous Tuesday by the ratio of the last day's average to the previous Tuesday's average. This accounts for the overall level change.\n\n But note: the last day (Monday) might have a different pattern than Tuesday. However, without more data, this is a simple approach.\n\n Let's compute:\n\n   Previous Tuesday (2015/4/14) data:\n        [24.83, 24.68, 24.66, 24.79, 24.95, 25.33, 26.71, 29.92, 30.94, 29.68, 29.05, 27.88, 27.37, 26.89, 26.05, 25.88, 25.57, 25.71, 25.89, 25.93, 25.89, 25.71, 25.23, 24.51]\n        Sum = 24.83+24.68+24.66+24.79+24.95+25.33+26.71+29.92+30.94+29.68+29.05+27.88+27.37+26.89+26.05+25.88+25.57+25.71+25.89+25.93+25.89+25.71+25.23+24.51\n        = 624.15\n        Average = 624.15 / 24 = 26.00625\n\n   Last day (2015/4/20) data:\n        [22.91, 21.96, 21.99, 22.91, 23.16, 24.38, 25.62, 27.99, 29.90, 29.56, 28.73, 28.39, 27.69, 26.82, 26.06, 26.09, 26.14, 26.12, 26.08, 26.18, 26.27, 26.21, 25.15, 24.58]\n        Sum = 22.91+21.96+21.99+22.91+23.16+24.38+25.62+27.99+29.90+29.56+28.73+28.39+27.69+26.82+26.06+26.09+26.14+26.12+26.08+26.18+26.27+26.21+25.15+24.58\n        = 616.29\n        Average = 616.29 / 24 = 25.67875\n\n   Ratio = avg_last_day / avg_prev_tuesday = 25.67875 / 26.00625 \u2248 0.9873\n\n   Then, for each hour h (0 to 23) on 2015/4/21, we take the corresponding hour from 2015/4/14 and multiply by 0.9873.\n\n   Example for hour 0: 24.83 * 0.9873 \u2248 24.52\n   We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 4. However, note that the last day (Monday) was a weekday and the forecast day (Tuesday) is also a weekday. The previous Tuesday was 7 days ago. This method assumes that the pattern of the Tuesday 7 days ago is still valid, but scaled by the overall level of the last day.\n\n 5. We'll compute the 24 forecasted values.\n\n Let's do the calculations:\n\n   Hour 0: 24.83 * 0.9873 = 24.52\n   Hour 1: 24.68 * 0.9873 = 24.37\n   Hour 2: 24.66 * 0.9873 = 24.35\n   Hour 3: 24.79 * 0.9873 = 24.48\n   Hour 4: 24.95 * 0.9873 = 24.63\n   Hour 5: 25.33 * 0.9873 = 25.01\n   Hour 6: 26.71 * 0.9873 = 26.37\n   Hour 7: 29.92 * 0.9873 = 29.54\n   Hour 8: 30.94 * 0.9873 = 30.55\n   Hour 9: 29.68 * 0.9873 = 29.30\n   Hour 10: 29.05 * 0.9873 = 28.68\n   Hour 11: 27.88 * 0.9873 = 27.53\n   Hour 12: 27.37 * 0.9873 = 27.02\n   Hour 13: 26.89 * 0.9873 = 26.55\n   Hour 14: 26.05 * 0.9873 = 25.72\n   Hour 15: 25.88 * 0.9873 = 25.55\n   Hour 16: 25.57 * 0.9873 = 25.25\n   Hour 17: 25.71 * 0.9873 = 25.38\n   Hour 18: 25.89 * 0.9873 = 25.56\n   Hour 19: 25.93 * 0.9873 = 25.60\n   Hour 20: 25.89 * 0.9873 = 25.56\n   Hour 21: 25.71 * 0.9873 = 25.38\n   Hour 22: 25.23 * 0.9873 = 24.91\n   Hour 23: 24.51 * 0.9873 = 24.20\n\n 6. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n However, note: the data on 2015/4/20 (Monday) had a dip at hour 22 and 23 (25.15 and 24.58) which is lower than the previous Tuesday. Our method uses the pattern of the previous Tuesday and scales it by the ratio of the overall level. This might be acceptable.\n\n But we must consider: is there a better way? We could also use the average of the last few days for the same hour? For example, the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday and the last day was Monday. We don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the same hour for the last 3 days? But the last 3 days include Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. The forecast is for Tuesday, which is a weekday. So we might use the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the previous Tuesday? But that's three days, but from different weeks.\n\n Given the constraints, we are to provide a forecast, we'll stick with the above.\n\n 7. We output the forecast for 2015/4/21 0:00 to 2015/4/21 23:00.\n\n Format:\n\n    2015/4/21 0:00 <forecast>\n    2015/4/21 1:00 <forecast>\n    ...\n    2015/4/21 23:00 <forecast>\n\n We'll write the forecasted values in the same format as the input, with two decimal places.\n\n Let's note: the ratio 0.9873 is approximately 0.9873, but we can use the exact ratio: 25.67875 / 26.00625 = 0.9873 (rounded to 4 decimals). We'll use the exact ratio for calculation.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute without rounding the ratio until the end.\n\n Let R = 616.29 / 624.15 = 0.9873 (we'll use 0.9873 for each multiplication, but to be precise, we can use the exact fraction: 616.29/624.15)\n\n We'll compute each value with the exact ratio and then round to two decimals.\n\n Let R = 616.29 / 624.15 \u2248 0.9873 (but we'll use the exact value for calculation to avoid rounding error)\n\n Actually, we can compute:\n\n   R = 616.29 / 624.15 = 0.9873 (we'll use 0.9873 for simplicity, but let's do exact)\n\n   R = 616.29 / 624.15 = 0.9873 (when rounded to 4 decimals) -> We'll use 0.9873.\n\n But to be precise, we can calculate each value as (value * 616.29) / 624.15.\n\n However, the problem does not require a complex model, and we are to provide a quick forecast.\n\n We'll use the ratio 0.9873 and round to two decimals.\n\n The forecasted values:\n\n  0:00: 24.83 * 0.9873 = 24.83 * 0.9873 = 24.52 (rounded to 24.52)\n  1:00: 24.68 * 0.9873 = 24.37\n  2:00: 24.66 * 0.9873 = 24.35\n  3:00: 24.79 * 0.9873 = 24.48\n  4:00: 24.95 * 0.9873 = 24.63\n  5:00: 25.33 * 0.9873 = 25.01\n  6:00: 26.71 * 0.9873 = 26.37\n  7:00: 29.92 * 0.9873 = 29.54\n  8:00: 30.94 * 0.9873 = 30.55\n  9:00: 29.68 * 0.9873 = 29.30\n 10:00: 29.05 * 0.9873 = 28.68\n 11:00: 27.88 * 0.9873 = 27.53\n 12:00: 27.37 * 0.9873 = 27.02\n 13:00: 26.89 * 0.9873 = 26.55\n 14:00: 26.05 * 0.9873 = 25.72\n 15:00: 25.88 * 0.9873 = 25.55\n 16:00: 25.57 * 0.9873 = 25.25\n 17:00: 25.71 * 0.9873 = 25.38\n 18:00: 25.89 * 0.9873 = 25.56\n 19:00: 25.93 * 0.9873 = 25.60\n 20:00: 25.89 * 0.9873 = 25.56\n 21:00: 25.71 * 0.9873 = 25.38\n 22:00: 25.23 * 0.9873 = 24.91\n 23:00: 24.51 * 0.9873 = 24.20\n\n But note: the last day (Monday) had a significant drop at the last two hours. Our forecast for Tuesday is based on the previous Tuesday, which did not have such a drop. However, without more data, we stick to the method.\n\n 8. We output the forecast in the required XML-like format.\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but there are none. So we proceed.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n    2015/4/21 0:00 24.52\n    2015/4/21 1:00 24.37\n    2015/4/21 2:00 24.35\n    2015/4/21 3:00 24.48\n    2015/4/21 4:00 24.63\n    2015/4/21 5:00 25.01\n    2015/4/21 6:00 26.37\n    2015/4/21 7:00 29.54\n    2015/4/21 8:00 30.55\n    2015/4/21 9:00 29.30\n    2015/4/21 10:00 28.68\n    2015/4/21 11:00 27.53\n    2015/4/21 12:00 27.02\n    2015/4/21 13:00 26.55\n    2015/4/21 14:00 25.72\n    2015/4/21 15:00 25.55\n    2015/4/21 16:00 25.25\n    2015/4/21 17:00 25.38\n    2015/4/21 18:00 25.56\n    2015/4/21 19:00 25.60\n    2015/4/21 20:00 25.56\n    2015/4/21 21:00 25.38\n    2015/4/21 22:00 24.91\n    2015/4/21 23:00 24.20\n\n But note: the previous Tuesday (2015/4/14) had a low at hour 23 (24.51) and we forecast 24.20. The last Monday had 24.58 at hour 23, which is higher than 24.20? But our method is scaling the entire day of the previous Tuesday by a factor less than 1.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n We output the forecast in the required format.\n",
