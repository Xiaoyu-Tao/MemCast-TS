        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/4/29 0:00 to 2014/5/5 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/5/6 0:00 to 2014/5/6 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Therefore, we must base our forecast solely on the historical price data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) and there are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the price and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power), we will use a time series forecasting method that can capture the daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows clear daily patterns (prices are lower at night and higher during the day) and also weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n 3. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or a simple seasonal naive approach. However, given the complexity and the need for a quick forecast, we might consider:\n    - A seasonal naive model: using the same hour from the previous day or the same day of the previous week.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past few days.\n\n 4. Considering the data, we see that the pattern for weekdays (Monday to Friday) is different from weekends. The next 24 hours are for 2014/5/6, which is a Tuesday (since 2014/5/5 was Monday). Therefore, we can look at the same day of the previous week (2014/4/29, which was a Tuesday) and also consider the most recent days.\n\n 5. However, note that the data from 2014/4/29 (Tuesday) to 2014/5/5 (Monday) covers 7 days. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the past 7 days and then adjust for the day of the week.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days are given higher weights.\n\n 7. Since the problem does not specify the method, I choose a simple method: use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (since the next day is a weekday) and the same day of the previous week. But note that the last three weekdays are:\n    - 2014/5/5 (Monday)\n    - 2014/5/2 (Friday)\n    - 2014/5/1 (Thursday)\n    and the same day last week: 2014/4/29 (Tuesday)\n\n 8. However, to avoid overcomplicating, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This will capture the seasonality and also smooth out any irregularities.\n\n 9. Let's calculate the forecast for hour h (0 to 23) of 2014/5/6 as the average of the same hour for the 7 days from 2014/4/29 to 2014/5/5.\n\n 10. But note: the data for 2014/5/5 (Monday) is the most recent and might be more relevant. We can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days. For example, we can assign weights that decrease as we go back in time.\n\n 11. Weights: let's assign weight 7 to the most recent day (2014/5/5), 6 to 2014/5/4, 5 to 2014/5/3, 4 to 2014/5/2, 3 to 2014/5/1, 2 to 2014/4/30, and 1 to 2014/4/29.\n\n 12. Then the forecast for hour h is:\n      forecast_h = (1*price_{2014/4/29 h} + 2*price_{2014/4/30 h} + 3*price_{2014/5/1 h} + 4*price_{2014/5/2 h} + 5*price_{2014/5/3 h} + 6*price_{2014/5/4 h} + 7*price_{2014/5/5 h}) / (1+2+3+4+5+6+7)\n\n 13. The sum of weights = 28.\n\n 14. However, note that 2014/5/3 and 2014/5/4 are weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and 2014/5/6 is a Tuesday. So including weekend days might not be ideal. Alternatively, we can use only the weekdays. The weekdays in the past week are:\n      Tuesday (2014/4/29), Wednesday (2014/4/30), Thursday (2014/5/1), Friday (2014/5/2), Monday (2014/5/5) -> 5 days.\n\n 15. Then we can use the average of these 5 weekdays for the same hour. Or we can weight them by recency: \n      weight for 2014/5/5 (Monday) = 5, 2014/5/2 (Friday)=4, 2014/5/1 (Thursday)=3, 2014/4/30 (Wednesday)=2, 2014/4/29 (Tuesday)=1.\n\n 16. Sum of weights = 15.\n\n 17. We'll use the weekday-only weighted average.\n\n 18. Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n      Let h0 = hour0 of 2014/4/29 (Tuesday) -> weight=1\n      h0 of 2014/4/30 (Wednesday) -> weight=2\n      h0 of 2014/5/1 (Thursday) -> weight=3\n      h0 of 2014/5/2 (Friday) -> weight=4\n      h0 of 2014/5/5 (Monday) -> weight=5\n\n      Then forecast for hour0 on 2014/5/6 (Tuesday) = \n          (1*price_20140429_0 + 2*price_20140430_0 + 3*price_20140501_0 + 4*price_20140502_0 + 5*price_20140505_0) / 15\n\n 19. We do this for each hour.\n\n 20. But note: the data for 2014/5/5 is the last day provided, and 2014/5/6 is the next day.\n\n 21. Let's extract the data for the same hour across these 5 weekdays.\n\n 22. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) with the prices from the 5 weekdays in the order: \n        [2014/4/29, 2014/4/30, 2014/5/1, 2014/5/2, 2014/5/5]\n\n 23. Then apply the weights and compute the average.\n\n 24. Example for hour0 (0:00):\n        Prices: \n          2014/4/29 0:00 -> 22.04\n          2014/4/30 0:00 -> 24.58\n          2014/5/1 0:00 -> 23.41\n          2014/5/2 0:00 -> 22.63\n          2014/5/5 0:00 -> 24.96\n\n        Weighted average = (1*22.04 + 2*24.58 + 3*23.41 + 4*22.63 + 5*24.96) / 15\n        = (22.04 + 49.16 + 70.23 + 90.52 + 124.8) / 15\n        = 356.75 / 15 = 23.7833\n\n 25. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 26. However, note that the data for 2014/5/5 is a Monday and we are forecasting a Tuesday. But we are using the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014/4/29) and the other weekdays. This should capture the weekly pattern.\n\n 27. Let's compute the forecast for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. We'll create a table for the 5 weekdays for each hour:\n\n Hour | 2014/4/29 | 2014/4/30 | 2014/5/1 | 2014/5/2 | 2014/5/5\n 0:  22.04       24.58       23.41      22.63      24.96\n 1:  21.36       24.04       22.61      21.84      23.83\n 2:  21.33       23.71       21.85      21.95      23.43\n 3:  21.61       23.63       20.97      22.39      23.69\n 4:  22.55       23.90       21.18      22.93      24.83\n 5:  23.91       25.50       21.43      23.49      26.24\n 6:  26.04       28.32       21.19      26.22      31.49\n 7:  28.32       30.97       22.53      28.56      33.44\n 8:  28.87       31.94       23.13      29.50      34.46\n 9:  28.59       31.51       23.83      29.41      33.59\n10:  28.22       30.66       24.09      29.10      32.86\n11:  28.14       30.42       24.17      28.58      32.36\n12:  27.98       29.55       24.03      28.70      32.82\n13:  27.62       29.52       23.99      27.04      32.32\n14:  27.33       29.29       23.49      26.27      31.48\n15:  27.16       28.81       23.41      26.13      30.52\n16:  26.79       27.90       23.41      25.88      29.89\n17:  26.78       27.00       23.80      25.85      30.07\n18:  26.78       27.80       24.09      26.77      31.58\n19:  27.00       28.47       24.99      27.38      31.64\n20:  27.26       28.26       25.24      27.41      31.74\n21:  27.39       27.69       25.96      27.68      31.34\n22:  26.58       26.79       25.12      27.15      29.85\n23:  24.74       25.22       23.31      25.82      26.38\n\n 29. Now, for each hour, we compute:\n        forecast = (1 * d1 + 2 * d2 + 3 * d3 + 4 * d4 + 5 * d5) / 15\n\n 30.
