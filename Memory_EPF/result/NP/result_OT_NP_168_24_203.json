        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-11-22 00:00 to 2016-11-28 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-11-29 00:00 to 2016-11-29 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are an expert, we can use a time series model. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, we only have one week of data, so weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n We note that the data shows:\n   - Daily patterns: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Weekdays vs weekends: the weekend (26th and 27th, Saturday and Sunday) shows lower prices.\n\n The last day in the data is Monday, 2016-11-28. We are to forecast Tuesday, 2016-11-29.\n\n We can use a simple approach: \n   a) Calculate the average day profile for weekdays and weekends? But note: \n        - 22nd (Tue), 23rd (Wed), 24th (Thu), 25th (Fri) -> weekdays\n        - 26th (Sat), 27th (Sun) -> weekend\n        - 28th (Mon) -> weekday\n\n   However, we are forecasting a Tuesday. So we can look at the previous Tuesday (22nd) and also the recent Monday (28th) and the pattern from the weekdays.\n\n But note: the data on 2016-11-28 (Monday) was unusually high (peaked at 49.97) compared to the previous weekdays.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing for the same hour of the day.\n\n Since we are limited to the given data and must provide a forecast without external data, we can do:\n\n   For each hour h in [0,23] (where 0 is 00:00, 1 is 01:00, ... 23 is 23:00) of the day:\n\n      Let the historical values for the same hour in the past 7 days be:\n        h0: 2016-11-22 (Tuesday) at hour h\n        h1: 2016-11-23 (Wednesday) at hour h\n        h2: 2016-11-24 (Thursday) at hour h\n        h3: 2016-11-25 (Friday) at hour h\n        h4: 2016-11-26 (Saturday) at hour h -> weekend\n        h5: 2016-11-27 (Sunday) at hour h -> weekend\n        h6: 2016-11-28 (Monday) at hour h\n\n   We are forecasting for Tuesday, 2016-11-29. We can use:\n        - The same day of the previous week (2016-11-22) and the Monday (2016-11-28) might be the most relevant.\n\n   However, the Monday (28th) was an outlier in the evening. So we might take a weighted average.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last three weekdays (excluding the previous Tuesday because it's a week ago) and adjust for the recent trend.\n\n   But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values (none here) and provide a forecast.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        forecast_h = (h6 * 0.5 + h0 * 0.3 + (h1+h2+h3)/3 * 0.2)   [for example]\n\n   However, without more data, it's hard to set weights.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last two weekdays that are the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday (22nd) and one Monday (28th) and we are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n   We can also consider a simple method: use the value of the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week.\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the given data, we can do:\n\n        For each hour h, take the average of the same hour from:\n          - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday 22nd) \n          - The previous day (Monday 28th)\n\n        But we note that the Monday 28th was a high price day. So we might want to dampen that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a naive seasonal model: \n        forecast = value from the same day last week (i.e., 7 days ago)\n\n   However, that would be:\n\n        2016-11-29 00:00 = 2016-11-22 00:00 = 33.24\n        2016-11-29 01:00 = 2016-11-22 01:00 = 32.53\n        ... and so on.\n\n   But we see that the prices on 2016-11-28 (Monday) were much higher than the previous Monday (which we don't have) and the Tuesday of last week (22nd) was a normal day.\n\n   We can also consider the trend: the average price of the entire last day (Monday 28th) is higher than the Tuesday of last week.\n\n   Let's compute the average for Monday 28th: \n        (31.08+29.97+29.63+30.16+32.19+33.72+37.39+43.69+44.49+42.68+39.44+41.32+39.05+41.92+43.17+44.90+46.17+49.97+45.99+41.68+40.55+37.97+36.16+34.63) / 24\n        = about 39.5\n\n   The average for Tuesday 22nd:\n        (33.24+32.53+32.08+32.21+33.16+34.52+37.82+40.39+41.14+40.69+39.77+40.08+40.20+40.44+41.21+41.69+42.88+42.87+41.42+40.30+39.29+37.32+36.51+34.93) / 24\n        = about 38.0\n\n   So the average price level has increased by about 1.5.\n\n   Therefore, we can adjust the last Tuesday's profile by the difference in the overall level of the last day and the last Tuesday:\n\n        forecast_h = (value from 2016-11-22 at hour h) + (average of 2016-11-28 - average of 2016-11-22)\n\n        = value_22nd_h + (39.5 - 38.0) = value_22nd_h + 1.5\n\n   But note: the increase might not be uniform. Also, the Monday was an outlier in the evening.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days for that hour and then adjust by the overall trend? But we have only 7 days.\n\n   Considering the above, we can do:\n\n        forecast_h = (value from 7 days ago at hour h) * (value from 1 day ago at hour h) / (value from 8 days ago at hour h)\n\n   But we don't have 8 days ago.\n\n   Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n        Option 1: Use the same hour from the previous day (Monday 28th) as the forecast for Tuesday 29th? But that ignores the day of the week effect.\n\n        Option 2: Use the same hour from the same day last week (Tuesday 22nd) and adjust by the ratio of the overall level of the last day (Monday 28th) to the overall level of the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week.\n\n   We don't have the previous Monday (21st) because our data starts on 22nd.\n\n   Therefore, we can use:\n\n        forecast_h = (value from 7 days ago at hour h)   [the Monday 28th]   -> but that would be for Tuesday? No, 7 days ago from 29th is 22nd (Tuesday) and 1 day ago is 28th (Monday). \n\n   Actually, we are forecasting 2016-11-29, so:\n        1 day ago: 2016-11-28 (Monday) -> same hour\n        7 days ago: 2016-11-22 (Tuesday) -> same hour and same day of week.\n\n   We can take a weighted average of these two:\n\n        forecast_h = 0.5 * (value_28th_h) + 0.5 * (value_22nd_h)\n\n   Why 0.5? Because we don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other. But note that the Monday 28th was a very high price day, and the Tuesday 22nd was a normal day. The forecast might be a blend.\n\n   However, we note that the price pattern on weekdays is similar: low at night, high during the day. The weekend was lower.\n\n   Let's try with h=0 (00:00):\n        2016-11-22 00:00: 33.24\n        2016-11-28 00:00: 31.08\n        forecast_00 = 0.5*33.24 + 0.5*31.08 = 32.16\n\n   But the last Monday at 00:00 was 31.08 and the last Tuesday at 00:00 was 33.24. The average is 32.16.\n\n   However, we see that the prices on Monday 28th were higher during the day, but at 00:00 it was lower. So the pattern might be shifting.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) for the same hour? But Friday 25th and Thursday 24th and Monday 28th? \n\n   Weekdays in the last week: \n        Monday: 28th\n        Friday: 25th\n        Thursday: 24th\n        Wednesday: 23rd\n        Tuesday: 22nd\n\n   We are forecasting a Tuesday. We can take the average of the same hour on the last week (Tuesday 22nd) and the average of the same hour on the most recent three weekdays (Mon, Fri, Thu) and then average these two?\n\n   But note: the Monday 28th is the most recent and might be the most relevant.\n\n   Given the time and simplicity, I will use:\n\n        forecast_h = (value_22nd_h * 1 + value_28th_h * 2) / 3\n\n   Why? Because the Monday 28th is more recent and we give it double weight.\n\n   Then we get for h=0: (33.24*1 + 31.08*2) / 3 = (33.24+62.16)/3 = 95.4/3 = 31.8\n\n   Let's check a peak hour, say 17:00 (5 PM):\n        2016-11-22 17:00: 42.87\n        2016-11-28 17:00: 49.97\n        forecast_17 = (42.87*1 + 49.97*2)/3 = (42.87+99.94)/3 = 142.81/3 = 47.6033 -> about 47.60\n\n   This seems to capture the recent high price on Monday.\n\n   But note: the Monday 28th had a very high peak at 17:00 (49.97) which might be an outlier. However, as an expert, we know that electricity prices can be volatile and recent conditions might persist.\n\n   We'll use this method: for each hour h from 0 to 23:\n\n        forecast_h = (value from 7 days ago at hour h + 2 * value from 1 day ago at hour h) / 3\n\n   However, we must be cautious: the data for 2016-11-28 has some very high values. But without more context, we use this.\n\n   Let's compute the entire 24 hours:\n\n        We have:\n          date_22nd = 2016-11-22 (Tuesday) -> index 0 to 23 in the first day of the data\n          date_28th = 2016-11-28 (Monday) -> index 144 to 167 (since 6 days * 24 = 144, then 144 to 167)\n\n        The data for 22nd: \n           00:00: 33.24 -> index0\n           01:00: 32.53 -> index1\n           ... \n        The data for 28th:\n           00:00: 31.08 -> index144\n           144: 31.08, 145:29.97, 146:29.63, 147:30.16, 148:32.19, 149:33.72, 150:37.39, 151:43.69, 152:44.49, 153:42.68, 154:39.44, 155:41.32, 156:39.05, 157:41.92, 158:43.17, 159:44.90, 160:46.17, 161:49.97, 162:45.99, 163:41.68, 164:40.55, 165:37.97, 166:36.16, 167:34.63\n\n        For hour 0 (00:00): (33.24 + 2*31.08)/3 = (33.24+62.16)/3 = 95.4/3 = 31.80\n        For hour 1 (01:00): (32.53 + 2*29.97)/3 = (32.53+59.94)/3 = 92.47/3 = 30.8233 -> 30.82\n        ...\n\n   We'll compute all 24.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a more robust method by including more days? But the problem says we are an expert and we have to use our judgment.\n\n   Considering the volatility and the fact that the Monday was an outlier, we might cap the forecasted price? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   We'll proceed with the above.\n\n   Let's compute:\n\n        Hour 0: (33.24 + 2*31.08)/3 = 31.80\n        Hour 1: (32.53 + 2*29.97)/3 = (32.53+59.94)=92.47/3=30.8233 -> 30.82\n        Hour 2: (32.08 + 2*29.63)/3 = (32.08+59.26)=91.34/3=30.4467 -> 30.45\n        Hour 3: (32.21 + 2*30.16)/3 = (32.21+60.32)=92.53/3=30.8433 -> 30.84\n        Hour 4: (33.16 + 2*32.19)/3 = (33.16+64.38)=97.54/3=32.5133 -> 32.51\n        Hour 5: (34.52 + 2*33.72)/3 = (34.52+67.44)=101.96/3=33.9867 -> 33.99\n        Hour 6: (37.82 + 2*37.39)/3 = (37.82+74.78)=112.6/3=37.5333 -> 37.53\n        Hour 7: (40.39 + 2*43.69)/3 = (40.39+87.38)=127.77/3=42.59\n        Hour 8: (41.14 + 2*44.49)/3 = (41.14+88.98)=130.12/3=43.3733 -> 43.37\n        Hour 9: (40.69 + 2*42.68)/3 = (40.69+85.36)=126.05/3=42.0167 -> 42.02\n        Hour 10: (39.77 + 2*39.44)/3 = (39.77+78.88)=118.65/3=39.55\n        Hour 11: (40.08 + 2*41.32)/3 = (40.08+82.64)=122.72/3=40.9067 -> 40.91\n        Hour 12: (40.20 + 2*39.05)/3 = (40.20+78.10)=118.30/3=39.4333 -> 39.43\n        Hour 13: (40.44 + 2*41.92)/3 = (40.44+83.84)=124.28/3=41.4267 -> 41.43\n        Hour 14: (41.21 + 2*43.17)/3 = (41.21+86.34)=127.55/3=42.5167 -> 42.52\n        Hour 15: (41.69 + 2*44.90)/3 = (41.69+89.80)=131.49/3=43.83\n        Hour 16: (42.88 + 2*46.17)/3 = (42.88+92.34)=135.22/3=45.0733 -> 45.07\n        Hour 17: (42.87 + 2*49.97)/3 = (42.87+99.94)=142.81/3=47.6033 -> 47.60\n        Hour 18: (41.42 + 2*45.99)/3 = (41.42+91.98)=133.40/3=44.4667 -> 44.47\n        Hour 19: (40.30 + 2*41.68)/3 = (40.30+83.36)=123.66/3=41.22\n        Hour 20: (39.29 + 2*40.55)/3 = (39.29+81.10)=120.39/3=40.13\n        Hour 21: (37.32 + 2*37.97)/3 = (37.32+75.94)=113.26/3=37.7533 -> 37.75\n        Hour 22: (36.51 + 2*36.16)/3 = (36.51+72.32)=108.83/3=36.2767 -> 36.28\n        Hour 23: (34.93 + 2*34.63)/3 = (34.93+69.26)=104.19/3=34.73\n\n   So the forecast for 2016-11-29:\n\n        00:00: 31.80\n        01:00: 30.82\n        02:00: 30.45\n        03:00: 30.84\n        04:00: 32.51\n        05:00: 33.99\n        06:00: 37.53\n        07:00: 42.59\n        08:00: 43.37\n        09:00: 42.02\n        10:00: 39.55\n        11:00: 40.91\n        12:00: 39.43\n        13:00: 41.43\n        14:00: 42.52\n        15:00: 43.83\n        16:00: 45.07\n        17:00: 47.60\n        18:00: 44.47\n        19:00: 41.22\n        20:00: 40.13\n        21:00: 37.75\n        22:00: 36.28\n        23:00: 34.73\n\n   We output in the same format.\n\n   Note: This is a simple heuristic.
