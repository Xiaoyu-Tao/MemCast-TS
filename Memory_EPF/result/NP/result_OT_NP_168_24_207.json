        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (7 days * 24 hours). The task is to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2016-12-27 00:00 to 2016-12-27 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 records). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed electricity price) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical price.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we note that electricity prices exhibit:\n   - Seasonality (daily, weekly patterns)\n   - Potential non-linearity\n   - Possible impact of holidays (note: the period includes Christmas)\n\n However, the problem only provides the price and no exogenous variables. Therefore, we will use a time series model that captures:\n   - Autoregressive (AR) patterns: prices from the same hour of the previous day, previous week, and recent hours.\n   - Seasonality: daily cycle (24 hours) and weekly cycle (168 hours).\n\n Given the short forecast horizon (24 hours), we can use a model such as:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (e.g., Holt-Winters with daily seasonality)\n   - Or a simple approach: use the average of the same hour from the previous days (e.g., last 7 days) adjusted for any trend.\n\n However, note that the period includes Christmas (Dec 25) and Boxing Day (Dec 26) which are holidays. The next day (Dec 27) is a Tuesday, but the holiday effect might still be present? In many countries, the week between Christmas and New Year is a low-activity period.\n\n Considering simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables, we can use:\n   - A weighted average of the same hour from the last few days, giving more weight to the most recent days and the same day of the previous week.\n\n But note: the data provided is from 2016-12-20 to 2016-12-26 (7 days). We are to forecast 2016-12-27.\n\n Let's break down the data by day:\n\n  2016-12-20: Tuesday\n  2016-12-21: Wednesday\n  2016-12-22: Thursday\n  2016-12-23: Friday\n  2016-12-24: Saturday (Christmas Eve)\n  2016-12-25: Sunday (Christmas Day)\n  2016-12-26: Monday (Boxing Day)\n\n The day to forecast: 2016-12-27: Tuesday.\n\n Since 2016-12-27 is a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2016-12-20) and also the recent days (which are holidays). However, the pattern of holidays might be different.\n\n Given the complexity and without more data (like load or wind), we can use a simple method:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2016-12-27):\n     - Consider the same hour h from the last 7 days (2016-12-20 to 2016-12-26).\n     - But note: the last two days (2016-12-25 and 2016-12-26) are holidays and might have a different pattern.\n\n   We can compute:\n     Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (2016-12-20) and adjust by the trend of the last 7 days? \n     Option 2: Use an average of the last 3 same hours (i.e., from 2016-12-24, 2016-12-25, 2016-12-26) but these are holidays and weekend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where:\n     - The weight for the same day last week (Tuesday, 2016-12-20) is high (say 0.5)\n     - The weight for the most recent day (2016-12-26, Monday) is 0.3\n     - The weight for the day before (2016-12-25, Sunday) is 0.2\n\n   But note: 2016-12-27 is a Tuesday, so we have a Tuesday from last week. Also, the holiday effect might be fading.\n\n   However, without a clear model, we can also consider a moving average of the same hour over the last 7 days, but with linearly decreasing weights (more weight to the recent days).\n\n   Weights: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] for [2016-12-20, 2016-12-21, 2016-12-22, 2016-12-23, 2016-12-24, 2016-12-25, 2016-12-26]?\n\n   But note: the last three days are holidays and might not be representative for a Tuesday.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour from the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   Given the constraints, we decide to use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016-12-20) and adjust it by the average change between the last two days (2016-12-26 and 2016-12-25) compared to the same days the previous week? \n\n   However, that might be too complex.\n\n   Let me try a simpler approach: use the average of the same hour from the last three days (2016-12-24, 2016-12-25, 2016-12-26) and the same hour from the same day last week (2016-12-20). Then take the average of these four? But 2016-12-24 and 2016-12-25 are holidays and weekend.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a linear regression on the same hour over the last 7 days to predict the next day? But that's only 7 points.\n\n   Given the time and simplicity, we choose:\n\n   For hour h:\n      forecast = (price of hour h on 2016-12-20 * 0.4) + \n                 (price of hour h on 2016-12-26 * 0.3) +\n                 (price of hour h on 2016-12-25 * 0.2) +\n                 (price of hour h on 2016-12-24 * 0.1)\n\n   Why these weights? \n      - 2016-12-20 is the same day of the week (Tuesday) and gets the highest weight (0.4).\n      - 2016-12-26 is the most recent day (Monday) and gets 0.3.\n      - 2016-12-25 (Sunday) and 2016-12-24 (Saturday) get lower weights.\n\n   But note: the day of the week effect is important, and 2016-12-27 is a Tuesday. So we rely more on the previous Tuesday.\n\n   However, we must also consider that the holiday period might have a different pattern. The previous Tuesday (2016-12-20) was before Christmas and might be higher? We see that the prices on 2016-12-25 and 2016-12-26 are lower.\n\n   Let's test for a specific hour, say hour 0 (midnight):\n\n        2016-12-20 0:00: 29.55\n        2016-12-24 0:00: 25.34\n        2016-12-25 0:00: 23.51\n        2016-12-26 0:00: 25.50\n\n        Forecast for 2016-12-27 0:00 = 29.55*0.4 + 25.50*0.3 + 23.51*0.2 + 25.34*0.1\n        = 11.82 + 7.65 + 4.702 + 2.534 = 26.706\n\n   Now, let's look at the trend: the prices at hour 0 have been decreasing until Christmas and then increased a bit on 2016-12-26. So 26.7 seems a reasonable value.\n\n   We'll do this for every hour.\n\n   However, note that the data for 2016-12-25 and 2016-12-26 might be too low and not representative for a Tuesday? But we are in the holiday week.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous week (2016-12-20) and then adjust by the overall change in the average price of the last three days compared to the same three days the week before? \n\n   But we don't have data for 2016-12-19, 2016-12-18, 2016-12-17? We only have 7 days.\n\n   Given the above, we stick to the weighted average per hour.\n\n   Weights: \n        same day last week (2016-12-20): 0.4\n        yesterday (2016-12-26): 0.3\n        two days ago (2016-12-25): 0.2\n        three days ago (2016-12-24): 0.1\n\n   We'll compute the forecast for each hour from 0 to 23 for 2016-12-27.\n\n   Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n        d0 = value at hour h on 2016-12-20\n        d1 = value at hour h on 2016-12-26   # most recent day (yesterday)\n        d2 = value at hour h on 2016-12-25   # two days ago\n        d3 = value at hour h on 2016-12-24   # three days ago\n\n        forecast = 0.4*d0 + 0.3*d1 + 0.2*d2 + 0.1*d3\n\n   But note: the data for 2016-12-24, 2016-12-25, 2016-12-26 are for Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday. \n   However, we are in the holiday week, so the pattern might be similar to the previous Tuesday? \n\n   We'll proceed with this method.\n\n   However, let's check the data for hour 0:\n\n        d0 (2016-12-20 0:00): 29.55\n        d1 (2016-12-26 0:00): 25.50\n        d2 (2016-12-25 0:00): 23.51\n        d3 (2016-12-24 0:00): 25.34\n\n        forecast = 0.4*29.55 + 0.3*25.50 + 0.2*23.51 + 0.1*25.34\n                 = 11.82 + 7.65 + 4.702 + 2.534 = 26.706\n\n   Similarly, we do for all hours.\n\n   We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n   But note: the data for 2016-12-20 is 7 days before, and the other days are the last three days. We are not using the days in between (2016-12-21, 2016-12-22, 2016-12-23) because they are weekdays and not holidays? But we are in the holiday week, so we want to use the holiday days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three days (2016-12-24, 2016-12-25, 2016-12-26) and the same hour from the same day last week (2016-12-20) and then take a simple average? We are already doing that with weights.\n\n   We'll generate the 24 forecasts.\n\n   However, note that the data for 2016-12-20 is from a non-holiday Tuesday, and 2016-12-27 is a holiday week Tuesday. So we might be overestimating? But the last three days (holidays) are included to adjust.\n\n   Let's do one more hour: hour 12 (noon)\n\n        2016-12-20 12:00: 33.40\n        2016-12-24 12:00: 27.19\n        2016-12-25 12:00: 26.35\n        2016-12-26 12:00: 26.38\n\n        forecast = 0.4*33.40 + 0.3*26.38 + 0.2*26.35 + 0.1*27.19\n                 = 13.36 + 7.914 + 5.27 + 2.719 = 29.263\n\n   This is about 29.26, which is lower than the non-holiday Tuesday (33.40) but higher than the holiday days. It seems reasonable.\n\n   We'll use this method.\n\n   But note: the data for 2016-12-20 is the only Tuesday we have. We don't have a Tuesday from the holiday week. So we are blending the non-holiday Tuesday with the recent holiday days.\n\n   We'll have to do.\n\n   Let's generate the 24 hours.\n\n   We'll write a small table:\n\n   Hour 0: 26.71\n   Hour 1: 0.4*28.88 (2016-12-20 1:00) + 0.3*22.50 (2016-12-26 1:00) + 0.2*21.53 (2016-12-25 1:00) + 0.1*23.94 (2016-12-24 1:00)\n        = 0.4*28.88 = 11.552\n         0.3*22.50 = 6.75\n         0.2*21.53 = 4.306\n         0.1*23.94 = 2.394\n         Total = 11.552+6.75+4.306+2.394 = 25.002 -> 25.00\n\n   We'll do similarly for all.\n\n   However, note: the data for 2016-12-24, 2016-12-25, 2016-12-26 are not all at the same hour? We have to be careful to take the same hour.\n\n   We have the data for each hour for each day.\n\n   We'll create a list for each hour.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let's index the data:\n\n        Day0: 2016-12-20 (Tuesday) -> index 0 to 23\n        Day1: 2016-12-21 -> index 24 to 47\n        Day2: 2016-12-22 -> index 48 to 71\n        Day3: 2016-12-23 -> index 72 to 95\n        Day4: 2016-12-24 -> index 96 to 119\n        Day5: 2016-12-25 -> index 120 to 143\n        Day6: 2016-12-26 -> index 144 to 167\n\n   For hour h in [0,23] for the forecast day (2016-12-27):\n\n        d0 = data[h]   (h-th hour of day0)\n        d1 = data[144 + h]   (h-th hour of day6, 2016-12-26)\n        d2 = data[120 + h]   (h-th hour of day5, 2016-12-25)\n        d3 = data[96 + h]    (h-th hour of day4, 2016-12-24)\n\n        forecast_h = 0.4*d0 + 0.3*d1 + 0.2*d2 + 0.1*d3\n\n   Then round to two decimals.\n\n   We'll compute for h=0 to 23.\n\n   Let's code it in our mind.\n\n   We'll write the forecast for 2016-12-27 from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n   Note: the data we have:\n\n        Day0 (2016-12-20): \n           0:00: 29.55\n           1:00: 28.88\n           2:00: 28.49\n           3:00:
