        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/6/16 0:00 to 2015/6/22 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/6/23 0:00 to 2015/6/23 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points). But we are only given the 'OT' (observed price) and no other features. The problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but they are not provided. Therefore, we have to rely solely on the historical prices.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the price, we can use a time series model that uses past prices to forecast future prices. Given the hourly data and the clear daily seasonality (prices are higher during the day and lower at night), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 3. We note:\n    - The data has a strong daily pattern (24-hour seasonality).\n    - There might be weekly seasonality (168 hours = 7 days) but we only have one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days (from 2015/6/16 to 2015/6/22). However, for forecasting the next day (a Tuesday, since 2015/6/22 is Monday, then 2015/6/23 is Tuesday) we can look at the same day of the previous week? But we only have one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days, so we can use the pattern of the same hour from the previous days.\n\n 4. Given the constraints, we can use a simple approach: \n    - We can compute the average of the same hour for the last 7 days (if available) and adjust for any trend? But we only have 7 days, so we can take the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern? But we have only one week? Actually, we have 7 days, so we can use the same hour from the previous days? But the problem is that the next day (2015/6/23) is a Tuesday, and we have data for the previous Tuesday (2015/6/16) and also the Monday (2015/6/22) and so on.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the data has seasonality, so we can use a seasonal naive method: using the same hour from the previous day? But the previous day (2015/6/22) was a Monday and we are forecasting a Tuesday? So we can use the same hour from the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2015/6/16, which was a Tuesday) but adjusted by the recent trend? \n\n 6. However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values (but there are none in the provided data). Also, we are only given the price, so we cannot use other features.\n\n 7. Considering the above, we can use a simple method: \n    - We note that the data for the same hour of the previous day (i.e., 24 hours ago) is a good predictor. But we can also look at the same hour from the same day of the previous week (168 hours ago) and then take an average? \n\n 8. But let's look at the data: \n    - The price on 2015/6/16 (Tuesday) and 2015/6/17 (Wednesday) and so on. The next day is 2015/6/23, which is a Tuesday. So we have the same day of the week from the previous week (2015/6/16) and also the day before (2015/6/22, Monday) which is the most recent.\n\n 9. We can use a weighted average of the same hour from:\n      - The same day of the previous week (2015/6/16) \n      - The same hour from the day before (2015/6/22)\n    and adjust by the overall trend? \n\n 10. However, without more data, we can do:\n\n     Forecast for 2015/6/23 0:00 = (Price at 2015/6/16 0:00 + Price at 2015/6/22 0:00) / 2   ??? \n\n     But note: \n        2015/6/16 0:00: 11.00\n        2015/6/22 0:00: 11.47\n        Average = (11.00 + 11.47) / 2 = 11.235\n\n     But we also note that the price on 2015/6/22 (Monday) was generally higher than 2015/6/16 (Tuesday) because 2015/6/16 was the first day of the week? Actually, we don't know the context. \n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a seasonal ARIMA model? But we are not to code a complex model, and we are only to provide the forecast.\n\n 12. Given the simplicity required and the fact that we are only given the price, we can use the following method:\n\n     We compute the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would be 7 data points for each hour. Then we use that as the forecast for the next day? \n\n     For example, for hour 0:00, we take the prices at 0:00 for 2015/6/16, 2015/6/17, 2015/6/18, 2015/6/19, 2015/6/20, 2015/6/21, 2015/6/22 and average them.\n\n     Then we do the same for each hour (0:00, 1:00, ... 23:00).\n\n 13. Let's test with hour 0:00:\n\n        2015/6/16 0:00: 11.00\n        2015/6/17 0:00: 10.96\n        2015/6/18 0:00:  9.29\n        2015/6/19 0:00:  8.17\n        2015/6/20 0:00:  9.61\n        2015/6/21 0:00:  9.80\n        2015/6/22 0:00: 11.47\n\n        Average = (11.00 + 10.96 + 9.29 + 8.17 + 9.61 + 9.80 + 11.47) / 7 = 70.3 / 7 = 10.042857\n\n     But note: the next day is a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday (2015/6/16) was 11.00, and the Monday (2015/6/22) was 11.47. The average of 10.04 might be too low? \n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? For example, we can use exponential smoothing over the same hour of the last 7 days? \n\n 15. However, note that the problem does not specify the method. We are the expert and we have to choose a reasonable method.\n\n 16. Considering the data, we see that the prices on the last day (2015/6/22) are generally higher than the same day the previous week. So we might want to give more weight to the recent day? \n\n 17. We can use a simple method: use the same hour from the previous day (2015/6/22) and the same hour from the same day of the previous week (2015/6/16) and take the average? \n\n     For hour 0:00: (11.47 + 2015/6/16 0:00 11.00) / 2 = 11.235\n\n     But then we see that the price on 2015/6/22 was a Monday and 2015/6/23 is a Tuesday. So we might also look at the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) and the day of the same type (Monday) is not the same? \n\n 18. Actually, we have the same day of the week from the previous week: 2015/6/16 (Tuesday) and 2015/6/23 is also Tuesday. So we can use:\n\n        Forecast for 2015/6/23 0:00 = (Price of 2015/6/16 0:00 * 0.5 + Price of 2015/6/22 0:00 * 0.5) \n\n    but wait, 2015/6/22 is Monday, not Tuesday. So we should use the same day of the week? \n\n        We have: \n            Tuesday: 2015/6/16 and 2015/6/23 is Tuesday.\n            We don't have another Tuesday? We only have one Tuesday in the data? \n\n 19. Actually, we have only one Tuesday (2015/6/16) and the next Tuesday is 2015/6/23. So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n 20. Therefore, we can use a combination of the same day of the week (from the previous week) and the most recent day? But the most recent day is Monday, which is not the same as Tuesday.\n\n 21. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days? But that would be Monday, Sunday, Saturday? \n\n 22. Given the complexity and without more data, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This will smooth out the daily pattern and capture the average behavior. \n\n 23. We calculate the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the 7 days (2015/6/16 to 2015/6/22) and use that as the forecast for 2015/6/23.\n\n 24. We compute:\n\n        Hour 0: (11.00 + 10.96 + 9.29 + 8.17 + 9.61 + 9.80 + 11.47) / 7 = 70.3 / 7 = 10.042857 -> 10.04\n        Hour 1: (9.24 + 9.88 + 7.21 + 6.39 + 8.84 + 9.52 + 11.00) / 7 = 62.08 / 7 = 8.86857 -> 8.87\n        ... and so on.\n\n 25. But note: the data for the last day (2015/6/22) is higher than the previous days. So the average might be pulled down by the earlier days? \n\n 26. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the recent days. For example, we can use linear weights: the most recent day (2015/6/22) gets weight 7, the day before (2015/6/21) gets weight 6, ... and the first day (2015/6/16) gets weight 1.\n\n        For hour 0: \n            = (1*11.00 + 2*10.96 + 3*9.29 + 4*8.17 + 5*9.61 + 6*9.80 + 7*11.47) / (1+2+3+4+5+6+7)\n            = (11.00 + 21.92 + 27.87 + 32.68 + 48.05 + 58.80 + 80.29) / 28\n            = 280.61 / 28 = 10.0217857 -> 10.02\n\n 27. We can also use exponential weights? But linear weights are simpler.\n\n 28. However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we should handle the data carefully. We are not given any other features, so we have to rely on the price.\n\n 29. We decide to use the simple average (equally weighted) of the same hour over the last 7 days. This is a common baseline for seasonal data.\n\n 30. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: (11.00 + 10.96 + 9.29 + 8.17 + 9.61 + 9.80 + 11.47) / 7 = 70.3 / 7 = 10.042857 -> 10.04\n        Hour 1: (9.24 + 9.88 + 7.21 + 6.39 + 8.84 + 9.52 + 11.00) / 7 = 62.08 / 7 = 8.86857 -> 8.87\n        Hour 2: (8.13 + 8.88 + 5.99 + 4.89 + 8.18 + 9.17 + 10.51) / 7 = 55.75 / 7 = 7.964286 -> 7.96\n        Hour 3: (7.68 + 8.42 + 5.26 + 4.44 + 7.19 + 8.76 + 10.44) / 7 = 52.19 / 7 = 7.455714 -> 7.46\n        Hour 4: (7.94 + 8.30 + 5.33 + 4.24 + 5.84 + 8.40 + 10.48) / 7 = 50.53 / 7 = 7.218571 -> 7.22\n        Hour 5: (10.64 + 10.38 + 7.25 + 4.66 + 5.82 + 8.60 + 11.25) / 7 = 58.6 / 7 = 8.371429 -> 8.37\n        Hour 6: (13.84 + 13.59 + 11.72 + 10.19 + 8.11 + 9.01 + 16.00) / 7 = 82.46 / 7 = 11.78 -> 11.78\n        Hour 7: (21.41 + 22.15 + 13.77 + 12.01 + 8.92 + 9.74 + 19.35) / 7 = 107.35 / 7 = 15.335714 -> 15.34\n        Hour 8: (21.79 + 24.39 + 17.07 + 12.70 + 9.75 + 10.90 + 22.69) / 7 = 119.29 / 7 = 17.041429 -> 17.04\n        Hour 9: (21.14 + 23.91 + 15.92 + 12.99 + 10.40 + 11.31 + 24.10) / 7 = 119.77 / 7 = 17.11 -> 17.11\n        Hour 10: (20.43 + 23.32 + 14.98 + 13.58 + 10.97 + 12.02 + 24.60) / 7 = 119.9 / 7 = 17.12857 -> 17.13\n        Hour 11: (18.38 + 21.06 + 13.87 + 13.21 + 10.98 + 12.84 + 24.25) / 7 = 114.59 / 7 = 16.37 -> 16.37\n        Hour 12: (16.68 + 17.54 + 12.94 + 12.98 + 10.44 + 12.92 + 20.96) / 7 = 104.46 / 7 = 14.922857 -> 14.92\n        Hour 13: (16.38 + 15.47 + 12.73 + 12.73 + 10.05 + 12.53 + 20.71) / 7 = 100.6 / 7 = 14.371429 -> 14.37\n        Hour 14: (15.40 + 14.61 + 12.39 + 12.50 + 9.62 + 12.25 + 19.82) / 7 = 96.59 / 7 = 13.798571 -> 13.80\n        Hour 15: (14.50 + 14.04 + 12.12 + 12.15 + 9.46 + 12.27 + 19.30) / 7 = 93.84 / 7 = 13.405714 -> 13.41\n        Hour 16: (14.22 + 13.67 + 11.75 + 12.04 + 9.48 + 12.41 + 18.89) / 7 = 92.46 / 7 = 13.208571 -> 13.21\n        Hour 17: (13.98 + 13.17 + 11.96 + 12.10 + 9.90 + 12.96 + 18.22) / 7 = 92.29 / 7 = 13.184286 -> 13.18\n        Hour 18: (13.97 + 13.02 + 11.88 + 12.09 + 10.22 + 13.37 + 17.85) / 7 = 92.4 / 7 = 13.2 -> 13.20\n        Hour 19: (14.50 + 12.86 + 11.62 + 11.81 + 10.09 + 13.63 + 17.44) / 7 = 91.95 / 7 = 13.135714 -> 13.14\n        Hour 20: (14.34 + 12.56 + 11.18 + 11.52 + 9.79 + 13.73 + 17.53) / 7 = 90.65 / 7 = 12.95 -> 12.95\n        Hour 21: (13.98 + 12.11 + 10.74 + 11.84 + 10.02 + 13.84 + 17.09) / 7 = 89.62 / 7 = 12.802857 -> 12.80\n        Hour 22: (14.06 + 11.47 + 10.25 + 11.97 + 10.08 + 12.91 + 16.76) / 7 = 87.5 / 7 = 12.5 -> 12.50\n        Hour 23: (13.18 + 9.79 + 9.16 + 11.67 + 9.71 + 11.21 + 13.69) / 7 = 78.41 / 7 = 11.201429 -> 11.20\n\n 31.
