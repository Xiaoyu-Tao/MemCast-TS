        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/2/10 0:00 to 2015/2/16 23:00) and we need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2015/2/17 0:00 to 2015/2/17 23:00).\n\nHowever, note that the problem states that the dataset may contain missing values, but in the provided data there are no missing values. So we can proceed without imputation.\n\nAs an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, I will use a time series forecasting method. Given the data, I observe:\n- The data has a clear daily (24-hour) seasonality, with prices typically lower at night and higher during the day, especially in the morning and evening peaks.\n- There are also weekly patterns: note that 2015/2/14 and 2015/2/15 are weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and show lower and less volatile prices compared to weekdays.\n\nThe last day to forecast is 2015/2/17, which is a Tuesday (since 2015/2/10 was a Tuesday, so 7 days later is Tuesday again). Therefore, we might expect a pattern similar to the previous Tuesday (2015/2/10) and Wednesday (2015/2/11) but we must account for the recent trend and any special events.\n\nApproach:\n1. We can use a seasonal naive method that uses the same hour from the previous day or the same day of the previous week. However, the data shows that the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2015/2/10) had a different pattern than the recent days.\n\n2. Alternatively, we can use an average of the last few days (like the last 3 weekdays) for the same hour. But note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) are different.\n\nGiven that we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2015/2/10) and also the Monday (2015/2/16) and the Wednesday of the same week (2015/2/11) to get an idea.\n\nBut note: the data from 2015/2/11 (Wednesday) had a spike in the morning (up to 43.93) and evening (43.28). The next Tuesday (2015/2/17) might be similar but we don't have a direct recent Tuesday to compare.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, without additional variables (like grid load and wind power) we are limited to univariate methods.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a quick forecast, I propose:\n\n- For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of the same hour over the last three weekdays (excluding the weekend). The last three weekdays are: \n  - Thursday 2015/2/12\n  - Friday 2015/2/13\n  - Monday 2015/2/16   (note: Saturday and Sunday are weekends, so we skip them)\n\nBut note: the data we have for weekdays are:\n  Tuesday 2015/2/10 -> Weekday\n  Wednesday 2015/2/11 -> Weekday\n  Thursday 2015/2/12 -> Weekday\n  Friday 2015/2/13 -> Weekday\n  Saturday 2015/2/14 -> Weekend\n  Sunday 2015/2/15 -> Weekend\n  Monday 2015/2/16 -> Weekday\n\nSo the last three weekdays are: 2015/2/16 (Monday), 2015/2/13 (Friday), 2015/2/12 (Thursday). However, note that Friday might have a different pattern because it's the end of the week. Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2015/2/10) and the two following weekdays (Wednesday and Thursday) but that might be too old.\n\nAnother idea: use the average of the same hour from the previous day (Monday 2015/2/16) and the same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2015/2/10) and the day after that (Wednesday 2015/2/11) to capture the Tuesday pattern? But that might be too volatile.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most recent day (Monday) has a higher weight.\n\nHowever, note that the problem does not provide any additional features (like load or wind) so we are limited to univariate time series.\n\nGiven the above, I will use a simple method: \n  For each hour h (0-23), the forecast for 2015/2/17 at hour h is the average of the same hour h from:\n    - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2015/2/10)\n    - The next day of the previous week (Wednesday 2015/2/11) to capture the mid-week pattern? \n    - The most recent weekday (Monday 2015/2/16)\n\nBut note: the previous week's Tuesday and Wednesday had a spike on Wednesday (2015/2/11) which might not repeat. Alternatively, we can use the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and ignore the previous week? \n\nHowever, the day of the week matters. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we should use the most recent Tuesday (which is 7 days ago) and the most recent Monday (which is yesterday) and then adjust? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a seasonal naive method with seasonality of 24 hours, but that would just repeat Monday's pattern. But Monday (2015/2/16) was a weekday and might be similar to Tuesday? \n\nBut looking at the data, the previous Tuesday (2015/2/10) had a different pattern than Monday (2015/2/16). \n\nGiven the complexity, I will use the average of the same hour from:\n  - The previous Tuesday (2015/2/10)\n  - The previous Monday (2015/2/16)\n  - The previous Friday (2015/2/13)   [since it's pattern might be similar to a weekday]\n\nBut note: Friday 2015/2/13 had a spike in the evening? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the median to avoid spikes? \n\nBut without more data, I will use the average of the same hour from the last three weekdays that are not weekend and are the same type (weekday). However, the day of the week effect is important. \n\nI decide to use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) because they are the most recent weekdays. \n\nLet me list the dates for the same hour for the last three weekdays:\n\nFor hour 0:00:\n  2015/2/16: 26.08\n  2015/2/13: 27.79\n  2015/2/12: 26.80\n  Average = (26.08 + 27.79 + 26.80) / 3 = 26.89\n\nBut note: 2015/2/13 was Friday and had a higher base? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the same day of the week: for Tuesday, we only have one Tuesday in the data (2015/2/10). So we can use:\n  - The same day last week (2015/2/10) \n  - The same day two weeks ago? but we don't have.\n\nGiven the data limitation, I will use the average of the same hour from:\n  - The same day last week (Tuesday 2015/2/10)\n  - The previous day (Monday 2015/2/16)\n  - The average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) might be more stable.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are an expert, so we can use a more sophisticated method? However, without additional features and without a model, we have to keep it simple.\n\nI will use the average of the same hour from the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) for the forecast. \n\nBut note: the day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, and we are using Monday (which is the day before) and Friday and Thursday (which are weekdays but not Tuesday). This might not capture the Tuesday pattern. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2015/2/10) and the previous day (Monday 2015/2/16) and then take the average? \n\nI think a better approach is to use a weighted average:\n  - 50% weight to the same day last week (Tuesday 2015/2/10)\n  - 50% weight to the previous day (Monday 2015/2/16)\n\nThis way, we capture the daily seasonality from the previous week and the most recent day.\n\nBut note: the previous week Tuesday and the current Monday are both weekdays, but they are 6 days apart. \n\nLet me test for hour 0:00:\n  Tuesday 2015/2/10: 25.62\n  Monday 2015/2/16: 26.08\n  Average = (25.62 + 26.08) / 2 = 25.85\n\nBut the previous Tuesday at 0:00 was 25.62 and the Monday was 26.08, so the forecast for Tuesday 0:00 would be 25.85.\n\nSimilarly, for hour 1:00:\n  Tuesday 2015/2/10: 25.46\n  Monday 2015/2/16: 25.53\n  Average = (25.46+25.53)/2 = 25.495\n\nBut we see that the pattern on Monday 2015/2/16 was similar to the previous Tuesday? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the same day last week and the same day two days ago (which was Sunday, but Sunday is weekend) so that doesn't work.\n\nGiven the above, I will use the 50-50 weighted average of the same day last week and the previous day (Monday).\n\nBut note: the previous day (Monday) is a weekday and the same day last week (Tuesday) is also a weekday. This should be reasonable.\n\nLet's do the entire 24 hours:\n\nWe are forecasting for 2015/2/17 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\nFor each hour h in 0..23:\n   value = ( value of (2015/2/10 at h) + value of (2015/2/16 at h) ) / 2\n\nBut note: the data for 2015/2/10 and 2015/2/16 are both available.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: on 2015/2/11 (the day after the previous Tuesday) there was a spike. If there is a recurring event on Tuesdays? We don't have enough data to know. But without additional information, we stick to the two days.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nHour 0: (25.62 + 26.08) / 2 = 25.85\nHour 1: (25.46 + 25.53) / 2 = 25.495 -> 25.50 (rounded to two decimals as in the input)\nHour 2: (25.34 + 25.35) / 2 = 25.345 -> 25.35\nHour 3: (25.69 + 25.63) / 2 = 25.66\nHour 4: (26.05 + 25.90) / 2 = 25.975 -> 25.98\nHour 5: (27.10 + 26.65) / 2 = 26.875 -> 26.88\nHour 6: (28.46 + 27.76) / 2 = 28.11\nHour 7: (30.05 + 28.62) / 2 = 29.335 -> 29.34\nHour 8: (30.61 + 29.00) / 2 = 29.805 -> 29.81\nHour 9: (30.38 + 29.05) / 2 = 29.715 -> 29.72\nHour 10: (30.28 + 29.24) / 2 = 29.76\nHour 11: (29.45 + 28.69) / 2 = 29.07\nHour 12: (29.16 + 28.43) / 2 = 28.795 -> 28.80\nHour 13: (29.24 + 28.49) / 2 = 28.865 -> 28.87\nHour 14: (29.05 + 28.43) / 2 = 28.74\nHour 15: (29.12 + 28.51) / 2 = 28.815 -> 28.82\nHour 16: (29.74 + 28.97) / 2 = 29.355 -> 29.36\nHour 17: (30.94 + 30.39) / 2 = 30.665 -> 30.67\nHour 18: (30.83 + 29.78) / 2 = 30.305 -> 30.31\nHour 19: (29.58 + 28.72) / 2 = 29.15\nHour 20: (28.64 + 28.02) / 2 = 28.33\nHour 21: (28.47 + 27.76) / 2 = 28.115 -> 28.12\nHour 22: (28.09 + 27.48) / 2 = 27.785 -> 27.79\nHour 23: (27.36 + 27.21) / 2 = 27.285 -> 27.29\n\nBut note: the previous Tuesday (2015/2/10) did not have the spike that occurred on Wednesday (2015/2/11). So this forecast might be conservative. However, without any indication of a spike event, we output the above.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the Wednesday of the previous week to account for the possibility of a spike? But that would be for Wednesday, not Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, I will output the above 24 values for 2015/2/17 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\nBut note: the problem says to handle missing values, but there are none in the input.\n\nFinal forecast:\n\n2015/2/17 0:00: 25.85\n2015/2/17 1:00: 25.50\n2015/2/17 2:00: 25.35\n2015/2/17 3:00: 25.66\n2015/2/17 4:00: 25.98\n2015/2/17 5:00: 26.88\n2015/2/17 6:00: 28.11\n2015/2/17 7:00: 29.34\n2015/2/17 8:00: 29.81\n2015/2/17 9:00: 29.72\n2015/2/17 10:00: 29.76\n2015/2/17 11:00: 29.07\n2015/2/17 12:00: 28.80\n2015/2/17 13:00: 28.87\n2015/2/17 14:00: 28.74\n2015/2/17 15:00: 28.82\n2015/2/17 16:00: 29.36\n2015/2/17 17:00: 30.67\n2015/2/17 18:00: 30.31\n2015/2/17 19:00: 29.15\n2015/2/17 20:00: 28.33\n2015/2/17 21:00: 28.12\n2015/2/17 22:00: 27.79\n2015/2/17 23:00: 27.29\n\nBut note: the data format in the input had two decimal places, so we round to two decimals.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the price on 2015/2/16 (Monday) was generally lower than the previous Tuesday? and the average might be a bit low. But without more information, we proceed.\n\nTherefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours is as above.\n\nWe output in the required format.\n",
