        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2013/3/12 0:00 to 2013/3/18 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2013/3/19 0:00 to 2013/3/19 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values to handle.\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily and weekly seasonality. The data includes a week (7 days) of hourly prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like load or wind forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series model that uses only the target variable.\n\n We can use a model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (period=24)\n   - Weekly seasonality (period=168)\n\n However, note that the data provided is exactly 168 hours (7 days). We are to forecast the next day (24 hours).\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a simple seasonal naive approach or a more sophisticated model. But note: we are an expert and must provide a reasonable forecast.\n\n Observing the data:\n   - The prices show a clear daily cycle: low during the night, increasing in the morning, peak during the day, and then decreasing in the evening.\n   - The weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher peaks than the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).\n\n The last day in the data is Monday (2013/3/18). We are to forecast Tuesday (2013/3/19).\n\n Since we don't have exogenous variables, we can consider:\n   - Using the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday, 2013/3/12) as a base, but note that the pattern might change.\n   - Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the previous weekdays (if we assume weekly seasonality) or the average of the same hour of the last few days.\n\n However, note that the data for the last day (Monday, 2013/3/18) is different from the previous Monday (2013/3/11 is not provided, but we have 2013/3/12 Tuesday to 2013/3/18 Monday). We have:\n\n   Tuesday (2013/3/12), Wednesday (2013/3/13), Thursday (2013/3/14), Friday (2013/3/15), Saturday (2013/3/16), Sunday (2013/3/17), Monday (2013/3/18)\n\n We are to forecast Tuesday (2013/3/19). So we can use the same day of the previous week (2013/3/12) as a naive forecast? But note that the market conditions might have changed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour of the last few days? But the pattern on weekdays is different from weekends.\n\n Considering the above, a reasonable approach is to use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2013/3/12) as a base and adjust it with the recent trend.\n\n However, note that the last day (Monday, 2013/3/18) was lower in price than the previous Monday (we don't have the previous Monday, but we have the previous Tuesday to Monday). We can compute the average change from the previous week to the current week for the same day type? But we don't have the same day of the week for the previous Monday).\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last week (7 days) for the next day? But that would include weekend days which are lower and might not be representative for a Tuesday.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last three weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and the same day of the previous week? But we only have one Tuesday (2013/3/12) in the data.\n\n Given the complexity and without more data, a simple and common method is to use the same day of the previous week. This is known as the seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 1 week.\n\n Therefore, we will use the prices from 2013/3/12 (Tuesday) as the forecast for 2013/3/19 (Tuesday).\n\n But note: the data for 2013/3/12:\n\n 2013/3/12 0:00 41.85\n 2013/3/12 1:00 41.25\n 2013/3/12 2:00 41.04\n 2013/3/12 3:00 41.36\n 2013/3/12 4:00 41.87\n 2013/3/12 5:00 42.93\n 2013/3/12 6:00 45.06\n 2013/3/12 7:00 56.91\n 2013/3/12 8:00 59.27\n 2013/3/12 9:00 54.91\n 2013/3/12 10:00 51.72\n 2013/3/12 11:00 48.12\n 2013/3/12 12:00 45.45\n 2013/3/12 13:00 44.97\n 2013/3/12 14:00 44.48\n 2013/3/12 15:00 44.94\n 2013/3/12 16:00 44.74\n 2013/3/12 17:00 49.31\n 2013/3/12 18:00 59.22\n 2013/3/12 19:00 55.01\n 2013/3/12 20:00 47.90\n 2013/3/12 21:00 44.85\n 2013/3/12 22:00 43.50\n 2013/3/12 23:00 41.72\n\n However, we note that the overall level of the last day (Monday 2013/3/18) is lower than the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday, but we can see the trend from the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can adjust the seasonal naive forecast by the trend observed in the last week.\n\n How to adjust?\n   - Compute the average price of the last Monday (2013/3/18) and the average price of the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Instead, we can compute the average of the entire last week (2013/3/12 to 2013/3/18) and the average of the week before? But we only have one week.\n\n Therefore, we stick to the seasonal naive without adjustment.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. There are none, so we proceed.\n\n However, let's consider a more robust method: using an exponential smoothing model with seasonality. But we are not going to code that here.\n\n Given the constraints of the problem, we will use the seasonal naive method for the next 24 hours.\n\n Forecast for 2013/3/19 0:00 to 2013/3/19 23:00 will be the same as 2013/3/12 0:00 to 2013/3/12 23:00.\n\n Therefore, the forecasted values are:\n\n 2013/3/19 0:00: 41.85\n 2013/3/19 1:00: 41.25\n 2013/3/19 2:00: 41.04\n 2013/3/19 3:00: 41.36\n 2013/3/19 4:00: 41.87\n 2013/3/19 5:00: 42.93\n 2013/3/19 6:00: 45.06\n 2013/3/19 7:00: 56.91\n 2013/3/19 8:00: 59.27\n 2013/3/19 9:00: 54.91\n 2013/3/19 10:00: 51.72\n 2013/3/19 11:00: 48.12\n 2013/3/19 12:00: 45.45\n 2013/3/19 13:00: 44.97\n 2013/3/19 14:00: 44.48\n 2013/3/19 15:00: 44.94\n 2013/3/19 16:00: 44.74\n 2013/3/19 17:00: 49.31\n 2013/3/19 18:00: 59.22\n 2013/3/19 19:00: 55.01\n 2013/3/19 20:00: 47.90\n 2013/3/19 21:00: 44.85\n 2013/3/19 22:00: 43.50\n 2013/3/19 23:00: 41.72\n\n However, note that the last week's Tuesday (2013/3/12) had a peak of 59.27 at 8:00 and 59.22 at 18:00, but the following days (like Wednesday and Thursday) had higher peaks. The Monday (2013/3/18) had a much lower peak (max around 44.85). This suggests that the market might be in a downward trend. Therefore, we might adjust the forecast downward.\n\n But without more data (like the previous Monday) and without exogenous variables, it's difficult.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last three weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and the same day of the previous week? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Another idea: use the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) but adjust by the ratio of the average of the last day (Monday) to the average of the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n We have:\n   - The Monday we have: 2013/3/18 (average = (40.42+39.70+...+40.62)/24). Let's compute the average for 2013/3/18.\n\n   We can compute the average for 2013/3/18:\n     40.42, 39.70, 39.46, 39.93, 40.62, 42.33, 43.40, 44.38, 44.52, 44.27, 43.97, 43.84, 43.88, 44.24, 44.28, 43.95, 43.64, 44.18, 44.85, 44.62, 43.60, 42.85, 41.33, 40.62\n\n   Average = (40.42+39.70+39.46+39.93+40.62+42.33+43.40+44.38+44.52+44.27+43.97+43.84+43.88+44.24+44.28+43.95+43.64+44.18+44.85+44.62+43.60+42.85+41.33+40.62) / 24\n\n   We can calculate:\n\n   Sum = 40.42+39.70+39.46+39.93+40.62+42.33+43.40+44.38+44.52+44.27+43.97+43.84+43.88+44.24+44.28+43.95+43.64+44.18+44.85+44.62+43.60+42.85+41.33+40.62\n\n   Let me compute step by step:\n\n   Group:\n   40.42+39.70+39.46+39.93+40.62 = 200.13\n   42.33+43.40+44.38+44.52+44.27 = 218.9\n   43.97+43.84+43.88+44.24+44.28 = 220.21\n   43.95+43.64+44.18+44.85+44.62 = 221.24\n   43.60+42.85+41.33+40.62 = 168.4\n\n   Total = 200.13+218.9+220.21+221.24+168.4 = 1028.88\n\n   Average = 1028.88 / 24 = 42.87\n\n   Now, we don't have the previous Monday (2013/3/11) to compare.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire last week (7 days) and the average of the week before? We don't have the week before.\n\n   So we cannot do that.\n\n   Therefore, we stick to the seasonal naive without adjustment.\n\n   However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we must handle the data carefully. We might consider a simple moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n   Given the time and the requirement to provide 24-hour forecast, we choose the seasonal naive method.\n\n   But note: the data shows a clear weekly pattern and we are forecasting the same day of the week.\n\n   We output the values from 2013/3/12 for the next day.\n\n   However, to be more accurate, we can use the average of the same hour of the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   So we use the one Tuesday we have.\n\n   Therefore, the forecast is as above.\n\n   We write the answer in the required format.\n\n   Note: The dates in the forecast are for 2013/3/19.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2013/3/19 0:00 41.85\n        2013/3/19 1:00 41.25\n        2013/3/19 2:00 41.04\n        2013/3/19 3:00 41.36\n        2013/3/19 4:00 41.87\n        2013/3/19 5:00 42.93\n        2013/3/19 6:00 45.06\n        2013/3/19 7:00 56.91\n        2013/3/19 8:00 59.27\n        2013/3/19 9:00 54.91\n        2013/3/19 10:00 51.72\n        2013/3/19 11:00 48.12\n        2013/3/19 12:00 45.45\n        2013/3/19 13:00 44.97\n        2013/3/19 14:00 44.48\n        2013/3/19 15:00 44.94\n        2013/3/19 16:00 44.74\n        2013/3/19 17:00 49.31\n        2013/3/19 18:00 59.22\n        2013/3/19 19:00 55.01\n        2013/3/19 20:00 47.90\n        2013/3/19 21:00 44.85\n        2013/3/19 22:00 43.50\n        2013/3/19 23:00 41.72\n        </answer>\n\n However, note that the last day (Monday) was a low price day and the Tuesday of the previous week was a relatively high price day. There might be a downward trend. But without more data, we cannot be sure.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days? But that would include weekend days which are lower and might pull down the forecast for a Tuesday.\n\n We try to compute the average for each hour of the last 7 days and use that as the forecast? But that would be:\n\n   For hour 0:00: average of 2013/3/12 0:00, 2013/3/13 0:00, ... 2013/3/18 0:00.\n\n   Let's compute for 0:00:\n\n        2013/3/12 0:00: 41.85\n        2013/3/13 0:00: 41.44\n        2013/3/14 0:00: 42.80\n        2013/3/15 0:00: 43.15\n        2013/3/16 0:00: 42.62\n        2013/3/17 0:00: 42.11\n        2013/3/18 0:00: 40.42\n\n        Average = (41.85+41.44+42.80+43.15+42.62+42.11+40.42)/7 = 294.39/7 = 42.0557 \u2248 42.06\n\n   Similarly, we can compute for each hour.\n\n   This method would smooth out the daily pattern and might be more robust.\n\n   But note: the daily pattern is very important. The average for each hour over the week might dampen the peaks and troughs.\n\n   However, it might be a better choice given that the last week showed a downward trend.\n\n   We have to choose one method.\n\n   Since the problem says we are an expert, and we note that the last day (Monday) was significantly lower than the previous days, we see a downward trend, we might prefer the average method to account for the recent trend.\n\n   Therefore, we will compute the average of each hour over the last 7 days.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     For hour h (0 to 23), let the historical values for that hour over the last 7 days be:\n        h0: 2013/3/12 at h\n        h1: 2013/3/13 at h\n        h2: 2013/3/14 at h\n        h3: 2013/3/15 at h\n        h4: 2013/3/16 at h\n        h5: 2013/3/17 at h\n        h6: 2013/3/18 at h\n\n     Then forecast for 2013/3/19 at h = (h0+h1+h2+h3+h4+h5+h6)/7\n\n   We do this for each hour.\n\n   We'll compute the 24 averages.\n\n   We'll write a small program or compute manually? We can compute manually for 24 hours.\n\n   Let me compute:\n\n   Hour 0: (41.85 + 41.44 + 42.80 + 43.15 + 42.62 + 42.11 + 40.42) / 7 = 294.39 / 7 = 42.0557 -> 42.06\n   Hour 1: (41.25 + 40.87 + 42.00 + 42.99 + 42.45 + 41.78 + 39.70) / 7 = 291.04 / 7 = 41.5771 -> 41.58\n   Hour 2: (41.04 + 40.90 + 42.15 + 43.12 + 42.03 + 41.03 + 39.46) / 7 = 289.73 / 7 = 41.39 -> 41.39\n   Hour 3: (41.36 + 41.07 + 42.69 + 43.55 + 41.74 + 40.51 + 39.93) / 7 = 290.85 / 7 = 41.55 -> 41.55\n   Hour 4: (41.87 + 41.60 + 43.52 + 43.91 + 41.26 + 40.65 + 40.62) / 7 = 293.43 / 7 = 41.9186 -> 41.92\n   Hour 5: (42.93 + 43.18 + 45.11 + 45.02 + 41.84 + 40.96 + 42.33) / 7 = 301.37 / 7 = 43.0529 -> 43.05\n   Hour 6: (45.06 + 46.72 + 54.68 + 48.49 + 42.41 + 40.69 + 43.40) / 7 = 321.45 / 7 = 45.9214 -> 45.92\n   Hour 7: (56.91 + 61.88 + 83.92 + 71.64 + 43.08 + 40.61 + 44.38) / 7 = 402.42 / 7 = 57.4886 -> 57.49\n   Hour 8: (59.27 + 73.96 + 84.41 + 75.06 + 42.80 + 40.59 + 44.52) / 7 = 420.61 / 7 = 60.0871 -> 60.09\n   Hour 9: (54.91 + 75.54 + 63.98 + 65.47 + 42.89 + 41.03 + 44.27) / 7 = 388.09 / 7 = 55.4414 -> 55.44\n   Hour 10: (51.72 + 61.39 + 57.04 + 53.09 + 42.63 + 41.32 + 43.97) / 7 = 351.16 / 7 = 50.1657 -> 50.17\n   Hour 11: (48.12 + 48.52 + 50.18 + 47.90 + 42.41 + 41.08 + 43.84) / 7 = 322.05 / 7 = 46.0071 -> 46.01\n   Hour 12: (45.45 + 48.04 + 46.03 + 44.96 + 41.77 + 40.98 + 43.88) / 7 = 311.11 / 7 = 44.4443 -> 44.44\n   Hour 13: (44.97 + 46.93 + 45.68 + 43.96 + 41.19 + 40.81 + 44.24) / 7 = 307.78 / 7 = 43.9686 -> 43.97\n   Hour 14: (44.48 + 47.66 + 45.39 + 43.80 + 40.75 + 40.77 + 44.28) / 7 = 307.13 / 7 = 43.8757 -> 43.88\n   Hour 15: (44.94 + 46.60 + 45.91 + 43.27 + 40.89 + 40.72 + 43.95) / 7 = 306.28 / 7 = 43.7543 -> 43.75\n   Hour 16: (44.74 + 45.84 + 47.88 + 43.47 + 41.24 + 40.70 + 43.64) / 7 = 307.51 / 7 = 43.93 -> 43.93\n   Hour 17: (49.31 + 50.39 + 59.74 + 45.86 + 43.19 + 41.19 + 44.18) / 7 = 333.86 / 7 = 47.6943 -> 47.69\n   Hour 18: (59.22 + 59.28 + 72.82 + 54.97 + 45.29 + 42.57 + 44.85) / 7 = 379.00 / 7 = 54.1429 -> 54.14\n   Hour 19: (55.01 + 59.63 + 74.93 + 50.76 + 45.38 + 42.95 + 44.62) / 7 = 373.28 / 7 = 53.3257 -> 53.33\n   Hour 20: (47.90 + 50.08 + 58.09 + 44.64 + 43.05 + 42.21 + 43.60) / 7 = 329.57 / 7 = 47.0814 -> 47.08\n   Hour 21: (44.85 + 45.75 + 47.24 + 43.13 + 42.29 + 41.87 + 42.85) / 7 = 307.98 / 7 = 43.9971 -> 44.00\n   Hour 22: (43.50 + 43.54 + 44.39 + 42.24 + 42.18 + 41.36 + 41.33) / 7 = 298.54 / 7 = 42.6486 -> 42.65\n   Hour 23: (41.72 + 41.97 + 42.45 + 41.67 + 41.26 + 41.12 + 40.62) / 7 = 290.81 / 7 = 41.5443 -> 41.54\n\n   Therefore, the forecast for 2013/3/19:\n\n        0:00: 42.06\n        1:00: 41.58\n        2:00: 41.39\n        3:00: 41.55\n        4:00: 41.92\n        5:00: 43.05\n        6:00: 45.92\n        7:00: 57.49\n        8:00: 60.09\n        9:00: 55.44\n        10:00: 50.17\n        11:00: 46.01\n        12:00: 44.44\n        13:00: 43.97\n        14:00: 43.88\n        15:00: 43.75\n        16:00: 43.93\n        17:00: 47.69\n        18:00: 54.14\n        19:00: 53.33\n        20:00: 47.08\n        21:00: 44.00\n        22:00: 42.65\n        23:00: 41.54\n\n   This method smooths the data and accounts for the recent downward trend.\n\n   We choose this method because it uses all the available data and might be more robust.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above computed values.\n\n   Note: We rounded to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n   We write the answer accordingly.\n\n   Format:\n\n        <answer>\n        2013/3/19 0:00 42.06\n        2013/3/19 1:00 41.58\n        2013/3/19 2:00 41.39\n        2013/3/19 3:00 41.55\n        2013/3/19 4:00 41.92\n        2013/3/19 5:00 43.05\n        2013/3/19 6:00 45.92\n        2013/3/19 7:00 57.49\n        2013/3/19 8:00 60.09\n        2013/3/19 9:00 55.44\n        2013/3/19 10:00 50.17\n        2013/3/19 11:00 46.01\n        2013/3/19 12:00 44.44\n        2013/3/19 13:00 43.97\n        2013/3/19 14:00 43.88\n        2013/3/19 15:00 43.75\n        2013/3/19 16:00 43.93\n        2013/3/19 17:00 47.69\n        2013/3/19 18:00 54.14\n        2013/3/19 19:00 53.33\n        2013/3/19 20:00 47.08\n        2013/3/19 21:00 44.00\n        2013/3/19 22:00 42.65\n        2013/3/19 23:00 41.54\n        </answer>\n\n   This is our final forecast.\n\n   We note that the peak hours (7:00-9:00) are still high but not as high as the previous Tuesday (which had 59.41 at 8:00) because we averaged with lower days (like the weekend and the recent Monday).\n\n   This seems reasonable given the downward trend observed in the last day.\n\n   We output the answer.\n",
