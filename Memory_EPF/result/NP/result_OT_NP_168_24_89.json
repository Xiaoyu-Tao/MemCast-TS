        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-09-16 00:00 to 2014-09-22 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014-09-23 00:00 to 2014-09-23 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed electricity price) and the date. We don't have the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts, so we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we know that common methods include:\n   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n   - Exponential Smoothing\n   - Machine Learning models (like LSTM, but we don't have the capacity for that here)\n   - Simple methods like using the average of the same hour in the past week, or the last value, etc.\n\n However, note that electricity prices exhibit:\n   - Seasonality: daily and weekly patterns.\n   - Non-stationarity.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use a simple but effective method: \n   - We note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (prices are higher during the day and lower at night) and also a weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n We can use a seasonal naive approach: \n   - For each hour of the day (0 to 23) on the next day (which is 2014-09-23, a Tuesday), we can take the average of the same hour from the previous weekdays (Monday to Friday) in the available data? \n   - But note: our data starts on 2014-09-16 (Tuesday) and ends on 2014-09-22 (Monday). So we have:\n        Tuesday (2014-09-16), Wednesday (2014-09-17), Thursday (2014-09-18), Friday (2014-09-19), Saturday (2014-09-20), Sunday (2014-09-21), Monday (2014-09-22)\n\n   - The next day is Tuesday (2014-09-23). We can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014-09-16) and also the Monday (2014-09-22) might be considered? But note that Monday is the day before Tuesday and might be similar? However, the problem is that we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last few days (excluding weekends?).\n\n However, note that the pattern on weekends is different. Since 2014-09-23 is a Tuesday, we should use weekdays only.\n\n We have the following weekdays in the data:\n   - Tuesday (2014-09-16)\n   - Wednesday (2014-09-17)\n   - Thursday (2014-09-18)\n   - Friday (2014-09-19)\n   - Monday (2014-09-22)  [the next Monday]\n\n We can take the average of the same hour for these 5 weekdays? But note that Monday is the day before the target Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday is 7 days ago.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same day last week (2014-09-16) and then take a simple average? \n\n However, to keep it simple and given we have only one week of data, we can do:\n\n   For hour h (0 to 23) on 2014-09-23:\n      forecast = (value of hour h on 2014-09-16 [Tuesday] + value of hour h on 2014-09-22 [Monday]) / 2\n\n Why? Because Monday and Tuesday are consecutive weekdays and we expect similar patterns. Also, we are using the most recent Monday and the same day of the previous week.\n\n But note: the data from 2014-09-16 (Tuesday) to 2014-09-22 (Monday) is 7 days. The next day is the 23rd, which is the next day after the 22nd.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? \n\n However, the problem is that we are only allowed to use the given data and we must be simple.\n\n Let me check the data: \n   On Monday (2014-09-22) at 0:00: 30.91\n   On Tuesday (2014-09-16) at 0:00: 33.53\n\n The next Tuesday at 0:00: we might expect something in between? But note that the prices on the last two days (Sunday and Monday) were lower than the previous week.\n\n Another approach: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? (Friday, Monday, and the previous week Tuesday?).\n\n But note: we have only 5 weekdays: \n   Tue (16th), Wed (17th), Thu (18th), Fri (19th), Mon (22nd)\n\n We can take the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Fri, Mon, and the previous Tue) but that might not be consistent.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for all the weekdays we have? That would be 5 days. But that would include Wednesday and Thursday which are in the middle of the week and might not be as relevant for a Tuesday.\n\n Considering the above, I propose:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) on 2014-09-23 (Tuesday):\n      forecast_h = (value_h on 2014-09-16 [Tuesday] + value_h on 2014-09-22 [Monday]) * 0.5\n\n Why?\n   - We are using the same day of the previous week and the immediate previous day (which was Monday). This captures the weekly pattern and the most recent trend.\n\n But note: the data shows a downward trend? Let's see the last few days:\n\n   The prices on Monday (22nd) are generally lower than the previous Tuesday (16th). So we are averaging two days that are a week apart and the most recent day.\n\n However, we can also consider the possibility of a trend. We can adjust by the difference between the last two days? \n\n But without additional data, we stick to a simple average.\n\n Let's test for one hour: hour 0 (midnight) on the next day (2014-09-23 00:00):\n\n   Previous Tuesday (16th) at 00:00: 33.53\n   Monday (22nd) at 00:00: 30.91\n\n   Forecast = (33.53 + 30.91) / 2 = 32.22\n\n Now, what about the trend from Monday to Tuesday? We don't have a Tuesday to Monday trend from the previous week? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two days (Monday and Sunday) and the same day last week? But Sunday is a weekend and Tuesday is a weekday.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we will use the average of the same hour from the same day last week and the previous day (which is Monday, a weekday). \n\n Therefore, the forecast for each hour h for 2014-09-23 will be:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_h on 2014-09-16 + price_h on 2014-09-22) / 2\n\n But note: the last day we have is 2014-09-22 (Monday) and the same day last week is 2014-09-16 (Tuesday). \n\n However, we must be cautious: the pattern of a Monday and a Tuesday might be different? But in the absence of more data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's generate the 24 values:\n\n   Hour 0: (33.53 + 30.91) / 2 = 32.22\n   Hour 1: (33.37 + 30.34) / 2 = 31.855\n   Hour 2: (33.15 + 30.12) / 2 = 31.635\n   Hour 3: (33.18 + 30.19) / 2 = 31.685\n   Hour 4: (33.54 + 31.12) / 2 = 32.33\n   Hour 5: (34.39 + 32.60) / 2 = 33.495\n   Hour 6: (37.96 + 34.62) / 2 = 36.29\n   Hour 7: (41.04 + 36.05) / 2 = 38.545\n   Hour 8: (42.15 + 36.96) / 2 = 39.555\n   Hour 9: (41.36 + 35.73) / 2 = 38.545\n   Hour 10: (41.23 + 34.91) / 2 = 38.07\n   Hour 11: (40.27 + 34.69) / 2 = 37.48\n   Hour 12: (38.59 + 34.18) / 2 = 36.385\n   Hour 13: (38.46 + 34.27) / 2 = 36.365\n   Hour 14: (38.47 + 34.28) / 2 = 36.375\n   Hour 15: (37.89 + 34.29) / 2 = 36.09\n   Hour 16: (37.99 + 34.51) / 2 = 36.25\n   Hour 17: (38.68 + 34.96) / 2 = 36.82\n   Hour 18: (38.89 + 36.59) / 2 = 37.74\n   Hour 19: (39.97 + 37.81) / 2 = 38.89\n   Hour 20: (39.40 + 37.40) / 2 = 38.40\n   Hour 21: (38.28 + 36.81) / 2 = 37.545\n   Hour 22: (35.59 + 34.91) / 2 = 35.25\n   Hour 23: (34.35 + 33.80) / 2 = 34.075\n\n However, note that the last day (Monday 22nd) had a price at 23:00 of 33.80, and the previous Tuesday at 23:00 was 34.35.\n\n But wait: the data for Monday 22nd at 23:00 is 33.80? Yes, and Tuesday 16th at 23:00 is 34.35.\n\n But let me double-check the data:\n\n   2014/9/16 23:00 34.35\n   2014/9/22 23:00 33.80\n\n So the average is (34.35+33.80)/2 = 34.075.\n\n However, we must note that the prices on Monday 22nd were generally lower than the previous Tuesday. This method might be acceptable.\n\n But is there a better way? We could also consider the average of the same hour over all the weekdays we have? That would be 5 days. Let me try for hour 0:\n\n   Tue (16th): 33.53\n   Wed (17th): 33.48 -> but note: the next day is not Wednesday, so maybe not?\n   We are forecasting a Tuesday, so we want to use Tuesdays and possibly Mondays? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would include weekends and we are forecasting a weekday.\n\n Given the time constraints and the requirement to provide an answer, I will stick to the two-point average (previous week same day and the immediate previous day) because it is simple and uses the most relevant data.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2014-09-23 (Tuesday) is:\n\n   00:00: 32.22\n   01:00: 31.855\n   02:00: 31.635\n   03:00: 31.685\n   04:00: 32.33\n   05:00: 33.495\n   06:00: 36.29\n   07:00: 38.545\n   08:00: 39.555\n   09:00: 38.545\n   10:00: 38.07\n   11:00: 37.48\n   12:00: 36.385\n   13:00: 36.365\n   14:00: 36.375\n   15:00: 36.09\n   16:00: 36.25\n   17:00: 36.82\n   18:00: 37.74\n   19:00: 38.89\n   20:00: 38.40\n   21:00: 37.545\n   22:00: 35.25\n   23:00: 34.075\n\n But note: we must format the answer exactly as required.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"Please note that some data may contain missing values, so handle them carefully.\" But in this case, there are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n We output the forecast for the next 24 hours (from 2014-09-23 00:00 to 2014-09-23 23:00) in the required format.\n\n Let me write the numbers rounded to two decimal places (as in the input).\n\n   00:00: 32.22\n   01:00: 31.86   (rounding 31.855 to two decimals: 31.86)\n   02:00: 31.64   (31.635 -> 31.64)\n   03:00: 31.69   (31.685 -> 31.69)\n   04:00: 32.33\n   05:00: 33.50   (33.495 -> 33.50)\n   06:00: 36.29   (exactly 36.29)\n   07:00: 38.55   (38.545 -> 38.55)\n   08:00: 39.56   (39.555 -> 39.56)\n   09:00: 38.55   (38.545 -> 38.55)\n   10:00: 38.07\n   11:00: 37.48\n   12:00: 36.39   (36.385 -> 36.39)\n   13:00: 36.37   (36.365 -> 36.37)\n   14:00: 36.38   (36.375 -> 36.38)\n   15:00: 36.09\n   16:00: 36.25\n   17:00: 36.82\n   18:00: 37.74\n   19:00: 38.89\n   20:00: 38.40\n   21:00: 37.55   (37.545 -> 37.55)\n   22:00: 35.25\n   23:00: 34.08   (34.075 -> 34.08)\n\n But note: the input data has two decimal places. We round to two decimal places.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the rounding should be to the nearest hundredth.\n\n Let me recalc a few to be sure:\n\n   Hour 1: 31.855 -> rounded to two decimals: \n        31.855 * 100 = 3185.5 -> round to 3186 -> 31.86\n\n   Hour 2: 31.635 -> 31.64 (because 31.635 -> 31.64)\n\n   Hour 5: 33.495 -> 33.50 (because 33.495 is exactly halfway? but rounding rule: 5 or above rounds up -> 33.50)\n\n   Hour 7: 38.545 -> 38.55 (because 38.545 -> 38.55)\n\n   Hour 8: 39.555 -> 39.56\n\n   Hour 9: 38.545 -> 38.55\n\n   Hour 12: 36.385 -> 36.39\n\n   Hour 13: 36.365 -> 36.37 (because 36.365 -> 36.37? Let me check: 36.365 * 100 = 3636.5 -> rounds to 3637 -> 36.37)\n\n   Hour 14: 36.375 -> 36.38\n\n   Hour 21: 37.545 -> 37.55\n\n   Hour 23: 34.075 -> 34.08\n\n Therefore, the forecasted values are:\n\n   2014/9/23 0:00 32.22\n   2014/9/23 1:00 31.86\n   2014/9/23 2:00 31.64\n   2014/9/23 3:00 31.69\n   2014/9/23 4:00 32.33\n   2014/9/23 5:00 33.50\n   2014/9/23 6:00 36.29\n   2014/9/23 7:00 38.55\n   2014/9/23 8:00 39.56\n   2014/9/23 9:00 38.55\n   2014/9/23 10:00 38.07\n   2014/9/23 11:00 37.48\n   2014/9/23 12:00 36.39\n   2014/9/23 13:00 36.37\n   2014/9/23 14:00 36.38\n   2014/9/23 15:00 36.09\n   2014/9/23 16:00 36.25\n   2014/9/23 17:00 36.82\n   2014/9/23 18:00 37.74\n   2014/9/23 19:00 38.89\n   2014/9/23 20:00 38.40\n   2014/9/23 21:00 37.55\n   2014/9/23 22:00 35.25\n   2014/9/23 23:00 34.08\n\n We output in the same format as the input, but for the next day.\n\n Note: The date format in the input uses a slash for the date and a space for the time.
