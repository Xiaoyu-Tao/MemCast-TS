        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015-09-22 00:00 to 2015-09-28 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (2015-09-29 00:00 to 2015-09-29 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 consecutive hours). No missing values to handle.\n 2. We are only given the historical electricity prices (OT). The problem mentions the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but they are not provided. Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the price data and no exogenous variables, we can use a time series forecasting method that captures the daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows:\n   - Daily pattern: prices are low at night, rise in the morning, peak during the day, and fall in the evening.\n   - Weekly pattern: weekdays (Mon-Fri) typically have higher prices than weekends (Sat-Sun).\n\n We note that the last day in the historical data is Monday (2015-09-28). The next 24 hours are for Tuesday (2015-09-29). Therefore, we might expect a pattern similar to the previous Tuesday (2015-09-22) but adjusted for recent trends.\n\n However, without additional data (like load and wind forecasts) and given the constraints, we can use a simple method such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2015-09-22, which is 7 days before 2015-09-29) as the forecast.\n\n But note: the data from 2015-09-22 (Tuesday) to 2015-09-28 (Monday) is exactly 7 days. So the next day (2015-09-29) is the same day of the week as 2015-09-22.\n\n However, we must account for the fact that the level of the time series might have changed. We can adjust by the average change over the last week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But given the simplicity and the requirement for a quick forecast, we can do:\n\n   Forecast for 2015-09-29 00:00 = (Price of 2015-09-22 00:00) * (average price of last 7 days) / (average price of the week starting 2015-09-22)\n\n However, note that the week starting 2015-09-22 (Tuesday) to 2015-09-28 (Monday) is 7 days, but we are comparing to the same day of the week.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the data (2015-09-22). The previous Tuesday is not in the 168 hours (which only go back to 2015-09-22). So we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day and adjust by the trend of the last week.\n\n Let:\n   base_day = 2015-09-22 (Tuesday)\n   current_week = 2015-09-22 to 2015-09-28 (7 days)\n   next_day = 2015-09-29 (Tuesday)\n\n We can compute the average price for the base week (2015-09-22 to 2015-09-28) and the average price for the previous week? But we don't have data before 2015-09-22.\n\n Instead, we can compute the average of the last 7 days (2015-09-22 to 2015-09-28) and the average of the 7 days before that? But we don't have that.\n\n Therefore, we can use a simple seasonal naive: use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2015-09-22) for 2015-09-29.\n\n But note: the data shows a downward trend from the beginning of the week (2015-09-22) to the end (2015-09-28). The average price of the last 7 days (2015-09-22 to 2015-09-28) is:\n\n   Let's calculate the average of the entire week (168 hours) we have:\n\n   We can compute the average of the historical data provided.\n\n   However, without doing complex calculations, we can also note that the prices on 2015-09-28 (Monday) were generally higher than the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Given the constraints, we are forced to use a simple method. We will use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2015-09-22) as the forecast for 2015-09-29, but we adjust by the overall trend of the week.\n\n How? We can compute the ratio of the average of the last 7 days (2015-09-22 to 2015-09-28) to the average of the base week (the week starting 2015-09-22) is the same? Actually, we only have one week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the base day (2015-09-22) and then adjust by the change from the base day to the last day (2015-09-28) in the same hour? That might be too volatile.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? But that would capture the recent pattern but not the weekly seasonality.\n\n Considering the above, we decide to use:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on 2015-09-29 = (Price of hour h on 2015-09-22) * (average price of the last 3 days) / (average price of the 3 days starting from 2015-09-22 to 2015-09-24)\n\n Why 3 days? Because we want to capture the recent trend without including the weekend which has a different pattern.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let base_period = 2015-09-22 to 2015-09-24 (3 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)\n   Let recent_period = 2015-09-26 to 2015-09-28 (3 days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday) -> but note: we are missing Friday? Actually, we have:\n\n       2015-09-25: Friday\n       2015-09-26: Saturday\n       2015-09-27: Sunday\n       2015-09-28: Monday\n\n   We want to compare the same days of the week? Actually, we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we want to use the most recent Tuesday? But we don't have one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the entire week for adjustment? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        adjustment_factor = (average price of the last 7 days) / (average price of the base week which is the same 7 days? that would be 1)\n\n   So that doesn't work.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we might use a simple seasonal naive without adjustment.\n\n   Forecast for 2015-09-29 00:00 = 13.66 (which is 2015-09-22 00:00)\n   ... and so on.\n\n But let's check: the prices on 2015-09-28 (Monday) were higher than the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday. However, the prices on 2015-09-28 were:\n\n        00:00: 13.59, 01:00: 12.58, ... 23:00: 15.08\n\n   and the previous Tuesday (2015-09-22) at the same hours:\n\n        00:00: 13.66, 01:00: 12.32, ... 23:00: 14.72\n\n   The Monday (2015-09-28) was higher than the Tuesday a week ago? Not exactly: at 00:00: 13.59 vs 13.66 -> slightly lower.\n\n   But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we should use the Tuesday of the previous week.\n\n   However, the overall level of the week ending 2015-09-28 is lower than the beginning? Let's compute the average for the first 24 hours (2015-09-22) and the last 24 hours (2015-09-28):\n\n        First day (2015-09-22): average = (sum of 24 hours)/24\n        Last day (2015-09-28): average = (sum of 24 hours)/24\n\n   We can compute:\n\n        First day (2015-09-22): \n            sum = 13.66+12.32+12.05+11.94+12.26+14.95+17.86+21.03+22.08+21.94+21.83+21.33+21.05+21.09+20.25+20.93+21.32+21.81+21.81+22.57+20.96+18.67+16.30+14.72\n            = 13.66+12.32=25.98; +12.05=38.03; +11.94=49.97; +12.26=62.23; +14.95=77.18; +17.86=95.04; +21.03=116.07; +22.08=138.15; +21.94=160.09; +21.83=181.92; +21.33=203.25; +21.05=224.3; +21.09=245.39; +20.25=265.64; +20.93=286.57; +21.32=307.89; +21.81=329.7; +21.81=351.51; +22.57=374.08; +20.96=395.04; +18.67=413.71; +16.30=430.01; +14.72=444.73\n\n            average = 444.73 / 24 = 18.53\n\n        Last day (2015-09-28):\n            sum = 13.59+12.58+12.44+13.08+14.36+16.05+17.87+20.25+20.99+20.97+20.35+20.01+19.41+18.94+18.04+18.62+18.36+19.56+20.25+21.53+19.13+17.58+16.30+15.08\n            = 13.59+12.58=26.17; +12.44=38.61; +13.08=51.69; +14.36=66.05; +16.05=82.1; +17.87=99.97; +20.25=120.22; +20.99=141.21; +20.97=162.18; +20.35=182.53; +20.01=202.54; +19.41=221.95; +18.94=240.89; +18.04=258.93; +18.62=277.55; +18.36=295.91; +19.56=315.47; +20.25=335.72; +21.53=357.25; +19.13=376.38; +17.58=393.96; +16.30=410.26; +15.08=425.34\n\n            average = 425.34 / 24 = 17.7225\n\n        The average has decreased by about 0.8 (about 4.3% decrease).\n\n   Therefore, we can adjust the forecast by a factor of (17.week.avg / first.week.avg) but note: we are using only one day? Actually, we are using the entire week? We have the entire week.\n\n   Average of the entire week (168 hours) = total sum of 168 hours / 168.\n\n   We don't need to compute the entire week? We can use the ratio of the last day average to the base day average? \n\n        adjustment_factor = 17.7225 / 18.53 = 0.956\n\n   Then, forecast for 2015-09-29 h = (price of 2015-09-22 h) * adjustment_factor.\n\n   But note: the base day (2015-09-22) had an average of 18.53, and the last day (2015-09-28) had 17.72, but we are forecasting a Tuesday and the last day was a Monday. We might expect Tuesday to be similar to the previous Tuesday but adjusted by the recent level.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire week to adjust? \n\n        total_sum = we have 168 hours, we can compute the average for the week.\n\n        total_sum = (we have the data, but it's long) ... we can approximate? or we can compute.\n\n   However, to save time, we can use the two days we computed: the first day and the last day. But the week has 7 days, and the pattern changes.\n\n   Given the time, we decide to use the adjustment factor of the entire week? Actually, we don't have the entire week computed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 3 days (which includes the weekend and Monday) and the average of the first 3 days (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) to compute the adjustment.\n\n        First 3 days: 2015-09-22, 2015-09-23, 2015-09-24\n        Last 3 days: 2015-09-26, 2015-09-27, 2015-09-28 (note: we skip 2015-09-25? because we want 3 days and we have 3 days at the end)\n\n        But 2015-09-25 is Friday, which is a weekday, and we skip it? We should take the last 3 days: 2015-09-26 (Sat), 2015-09-27 (Sun), 2015-09-28 (Mon)\n\n        We want to compare to the first 3 days: 2015-09-22 (Tue), 2015-09-23 (Wed), 2015-09-24 (Thu)\n\n        The days of the week are not the same, but we are looking for an overall trend.\n\n        Let's compute the average for the first 3 days (72 hours) and the last 3 days (72 hours).\n\n        First 3 days: \n            We have the first 72 hours (24*3) from 2015-09-22 00:00 to 2015-09-24 23:00.\n            We already have the first day: 444.73\n            Second day (2015-09-23): \n                13.94+12.86+12.96+13.05+13.23+15.09+18.88+21.90+23.06+22.96+22.78+22.77+22.93+22.79+21.60+20.76+20.31+20.42+21.33+22.38+20.55+18.19+15.60+13.81\n                = 13.94+12.86=26.8; +12.96=39.76; +13.05=52.81; +13.23=66.04; +15.09=81.13; +18.88=100.01; +21.90=121.91; +23.06=144.97; +22.96=167.93; +22.78=190.71; +22.77=213.48; +22.93=236.41; +22.79=259.2; +21.60=280.8; +20.76=301.56; +20.31=321.87; +20.42=342.29; +21.33=363.62; +22.38=386.0; +20.55=406.55; +18.19=424.74; +15.60=440.34; +13.81=454.15\n            Third day (2015-09-24):\n                13.95+12.78+12.46+12.15+12.76+15.25+17.77+19.93+20.54+20.30+19.44+18.86+18.39+18.02+17.66+17.61+17.36+17.62+17.79+18.32+17.49+16.64+15.28+12.70\n                = 13.95+12.78=26.73; +12.46=39.19; +12.15=51.34; +12.76=64.1; +15.25=79.35; +17.77=97.12; +19.93=117.05; +20.54=137.59; +20.30=157.89; +19.44=177.33; +18.86=196.19; +18.39=214.58; +18.02=232.6; +17.66=250.26; +17.61=267.87; +17.36=285.23; +17.62=302.85; +17.79=320.64; +18.32=338.96; +17.49=356.45; +16.64=373.09; +15.28=388.37; +12.70=401.07\n\n            Total for first 3 days = 444.73 + 454.15 + 401.07 = 1299.95\n            Average = 1299.95 / 72 = 18.055\n\n        Last 3 days: \n            2015-09-26: \n                13.42+12.60+12.29+12.12+12.30+12.94+14.50+15.32+15.69+16.36+16.34+16.22+15.44+14.95+14.22+13.48+14.11+15.23+16.00+16.43+16.12+15.54+14.77+13.49\n                = 13.42+12.60=26.02; +12.29=38.31; +12.12=50.43; +12.30=62.73; +12.94=75.67; +14.50=90.17; +15.32=105.49; +15.69=121.18; +16.36=137.54; +16.34=153.88; +16.22=170.1; +15.44=185.54; +14.95=200.49; +14.22=214.71; +13.48=228.19; +14.11=242.3; +15.23=257.53; +16.00=273.53; +16.43=289.96; +16.12=306.08; +15.54=321.62; +14.77=336.39; +13.49=349.88\n            2015-09-27:\n                14.01+12.71+12.25+12.20+12.34+12.83+13.43+14.18+14.43+15.63+16.10+16.04+15.72+15.14+14.34+14.48+15.08+15.62+16.38+16.90+16.74+16.29+15.32+14.37\n                = 14.01+12.71=26.72; +12.25=38.97; +12.20=51.17; +12.34=63.51; +12.83=76.34; +13.43=89.77; +14.18=103.95; +14.43=118.38; +15.63=134.01; +16.10=150.11; +16.04=166.15; +15.72=181.87; +15.14=197.01; +14.34=211.35; +14.48=225.83; +15.08=240.91; +15.62=256.53; +16.38=272.91; +16.90=289.81; +16.74=306.55; +16.29=322.84; +15.32=338.16; +14.37=352.53\n            2015-09-28: we already computed: 425.34\n\n            Total for last 3 days = 349.88 + 352.53 + 425.34 = 1127.75\n            Average = 1127.75 / 72 = 15.663\n\n        This shows a significant drop (from 18.055 to 15.663).

+13.95=41.55; +12.05=53.6; +13.42=67.02; +14.01=81.03; +13.59=94.62\n            = 94.62 / 7 = 13.517\n\n   Then for 2015-09-29 0:00, we forecast 13.52.\n\n   Similarly for hour 1:00:\n\n        2015-09-22 1:00: 12.32\n        2015-09-23 1:00: 12.86\n        2015-09-24 1:00: 12.78\n        2015-09-25 1:00: 11.64\n        2015-09-26 1:00: 12.60\n        2015-09-27 1:00: 12.71\n        2015-09-28 1:00: 12.58\n\n        average = (12.32+12.86+12.78+11.64+12.60+12.71+12.58) /7 = \n            = 12.32+12.86=25.18; +12.78=37.96; +11.64=49.6; +12.60=62.2; +12.71=74.91; +12.58=87.49\n            = 87.49 / 7 = 12.50\n\n   This method might be better because it uses the same hour over the last week and averages out noise.\n\n   We'll use this method: for each hour h (0 to 23), we compute the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n   Steps for each hour h in [0,23]:\n        Let values = [ price of (current_date - 7 days) at hour h, \n                       price of (current_date - 6 days) at hour h,\n                       ... until \n                       price of (current_date - 1 day) at hour h ]\n        Then forecast_h = average(values)\n\n   The dates for the same hour for the last 7 days:\n\n        hour 0: \n            2015-09-22 0:00, 2015-09-23 0:00, 2015-09-24 0:00, 2015-09-25 0:00, 2015-09-26 0:00, 2015-09-27 0:00, 2015-09-28 0:00\n\n        hour 1: similarly.\n\n   We'll compute for each hour.\n\n   We have the data, so we can extract.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour0 = [13.66, 13.94, 13.95, 12.05, 13.42, 14.01, 13.59] -> avg = 13.517\n        hour1 = [12.32, 12.86, 12.78, 11.64, 12.60, 12.71, 12.58] -> avg = 12.50\n        hour2 = [12.05, 12.96, 12.46, 11.35, 12.29, 12.25, 12.44] -> \n                = 12.05+12.96=25.01;
