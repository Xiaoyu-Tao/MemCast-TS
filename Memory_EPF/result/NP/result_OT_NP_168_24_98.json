        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-11-18 00:00 to 2014-11-24 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014-11-25 00:00 to 2014-11-25 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we are told to handle missing values carefully. Since there are no missing values in the provided data, we can use the entire series.\n\n 2. We are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting. Common methods include:\n    - Time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)\n    - Machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest)\n    - However, without additional features (like grid load and wind power forecasts) and with only the price series, we must rely on univariate methods.\n\n 3. Given the data, we observe:\n    - The data shows daily seasonality (24 hours) and also weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends).\n    - The prices are generally higher during the day (especially morning and evening peaks) and lower at night.\n    - Weekends (like 2014-11-22 and 2014-11-23) have lower prices and less volatility.\n\n 4. Since we are to forecast the next 24 hours (one day) and we have 7 days of data, we can use a seasonal model.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We note that the last day in the data is Monday (2014-11-24). The next day (2014-11-25) is a Tuesday, which is a weekday.\n    - We can use a simple seasonal naive approach: take the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2014-11-18) and adjust with the most recent day (Monday, 2014-11-24) to account for the recent trend.\n\n    However, note that the data from 2014-11-18 (Tuesday) and 2014-11-25 (next Tuesday) might have similar patterns, but we also have the most recent Monday (2014-11-24) which is the day before.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use an average of the last few days (like the last 3 weekdays) for the same hour, but we must account for the weekly pattern.\n\n 6. Considering the constraints and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data (and no external libraries or complex model training), we can use:\n\n    Method: A combination of weekly seasonality and a daily adjustment.\n\n    Let Y(t) be the price at hour t (t=1,...,168 for the last 7 days).\n\n    We are to forecast Y(169) to Y(192) (i.e., the next 24 hours).\n\n    We can compute:\n        base_forecast = the value of the same hour from the previous week (i.e., 168 hours before, which is the same weekday and same hour).\n\n    But note: the previous week's same day is 2014-11-18 (Tuesday) for the forecast of 2014-11-25 (Tuesday). However, the market conditions might have changed.\n\n    We can adjust by the trend of the most recent day (Monday, 2014-11-24) relative to the same day a week ago (Monday, 2014-11-17). But we don't have 2014-11-17? We only have from 2014-11-18 to 2014-11-24.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 3 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and the Monday we have, and then adjust by the most recent day's pattern.\n\n 7. Since we don't have data before 2014-11-18, we cannot go back a full week for Monday. Therefore, we can do:\n\n    For each hour h (0 to 23) of the day:\n        Let last_week_hour = the price at hour h on 2014-11-18 (the only Tuesday we have in the past week)\n        Let last_day_hour = the price at hour h on 2014-11-24 (Monday)\n\n        We note that the price on Monday (2014-11-24) and the previous week Tuesday (2014-11-18) are different. We can compute a scaling factor for the entire day of Monday relative to the previous week Tuesday? But that might not be accurate.\n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for the same hour? But Saturday and Sunday are weekends and have different patterns.\n\n    Instead, we can use:\n        forecast_hour = (last_week_hour + last_day_hour) / 2   [simple average]\n\n    But we have more data: we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (we have Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday). However, note that Tuesday (2014-11-18) is the only Tuesday we have.\n\n 9. Given the complexity and the requirement for a quick forecast, we can use:\n\n     For hour h (0 to 23) on 2014-11-25 (Tuesday):\n        base = the price at hour h on 2014-11-18 (Tuesday last week)\n        recent = the price at hour h on 2014-11-24 (Monday, the day before)\n\n        We can take a weighted average: \n            forecast = (base * w1 + recent * w2) / (w1 + w2)\n\n        How to set weights? We can give more weight to the recent day (Monday) because it is closer in time. For example, w1=1 and w2=2.\n\n        So: forecast = (base + 2 * recent) / 3\n\n 10. But note: the day of the week matters. Tuesday and Monday are consecutive weekdays, but they are different. However, without more Tuesdays, we rely on the last Tuesday and adjust with the recent trend.\n\n 11. Let's test with the last Monday (2014-11-24) and the Monday of the previous week? We don't have the previous Monday (2014-11-17). So we cannot compute a trend for Monday.\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the overall trend of the last 7 days? The data from 2014-11-18 to 2014-11-24. We can compute the average price for each day and see the trend.\n\n    Day 1 (2014-11-18, Tuesday): average = (29.75+29.29+...+30.45)/24 = let's compute quickly:\n        We can approximate: the values are mostly in the low 30s, average around 32.5? (exact not needed)\n\n    We see that the prices on 2014-11-24 (Monday) are generally lower than 2014-11-18 (Tuesday). For example, at 0:00: 25.11 vs 29.75.\n\n    So the overall level has dropped. Therefore, we might adjust the last Tuesday's value downward.\n\n 13. We can compute the ratio (or difference) between the last Monday (2014-11-24) and the last Tuesday (2014-11-18) for the same hour? But that would be comparing Monday to Tuesday, which are different.\n\n 14. Given the time constraint, we choose a simple method:\n\n    For each hour h in 0..23:\n        base = value at h on 2014-11-18 (Tuesday last week)\n        recent = value at h on 2014-11-24 (Monday, the day before)\n\n        We note that the day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, so we have one Tuesday in the past. We also have the Monday of the same week.\n\n        We can use: \n            forecast = base * (recent / (average of Monday last week?))   but we don't have Monday last week.\n\n 15. Instead, we can use the average of the entire week to adjust the level.\n\n    Let:\n        avg_last_week = average of all prices from 2014-11-18 to 2014-11-24 (7 days)\n        avg_this_week = average of the last 3 days? or the last 1 day? \n\n    Actually, we don't have a full week of the current week? We are at the beginning of the week (Monday just passed, and we are forecasting Tuesday). \n\n    We can compute:\n        avg_last_week = average of the entire 168 hours = about 32.0 (by quick scan: 25-40 range, but many in 30s, and one day with 25) -> let me compute:\n\n        We can calculate the average of the provided data:\n\n        Total = (29.75+29.29+30.79) and 168 values -> we don't need the exact, but we can approximate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid this and use a simpler method.\n\n 16. Given the above, we decide to use:\n\n        forecast = (value_last_tuesday + value_last_monday) / 2\n\n    But this does not account for the fact that Tuesday and Monday are different.\n\n 17. We can also look at the difference between the last Monday and the last Tuesday (a week apart) and adjust:\n\n        trend = (value_last_monday - value_last_tuesday)   # for the same hour? but that would be comparing Monday to Tuesday? \n\n    Actually, we don't have the same hour of the previous Monday. We cannot do that.\n\n 18. Therefore, we fall back to a simple average of the same hour of the last three weekdays that we have? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n 19. Considering the above, we decide to use the following:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) on 2014-11-25:\n            forecast_h = (price of hour h on 2014-11-18) * 0.4 + (price of hour h on 2014-11-24) * 0.6\n\n    Why 0.6 for the recent day? Because the recent day is closer and might reflect the current conditions better.\n\n 20. But note: 2014-11-24 is a Monday and 2014-11-25 is a Tuesday. The pattern of Monday and Tuesday might be different. We have the last Tuesday (2014-11-18) to capture the Tuesday pattern.\n\n    We can also include the last Wednesday (2014-11-19) and Thursday (2014-11-20) and Friday (2014-11-21) for the same hour? Then average the weekdays? \n\n    The weekdays in the data: \n        Tuesday: 2014-11-18\n        Wednesday: 2014-11-19\n        Thursday: 2014-11-20\n        Friday: 2014-11-21\n        Monday: 2014-11-24   (we skip the weekend)\n\n    So for each hour h, we can take the average of the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) for that hour? But note: Monday is the day of the week before Tuesday? Actually, in the weekly cycle, Monday is the day before Tuesday.\n\n    However, we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we can give more weight to the previous Tuesday.\n\n 21. We design:\n\n        forecast_h = (w1 * price_h_Tue_prev + w2 * price_h_Wed + w3 * price_h_Thu + w4 * price_h_Fri + w5 * price_h_Mon) / (w1+w2+w3+w4+w5)\n\n    Weights: \n        w1 = 2 (for the same day of the week)\n        w2 = w3 = w4 = w5 = 1\n\n    Then: forecast_h = (2*Tue_prev + Wed + Thu + Fri + Mon) / 6\n\n 22. Let's test with h=0 (midnight):\n\n        Tue_prev (2014-11-18 0:00): 29.75\n        Wed (2014-11-19 0:00): 31.89\n        Thu (2014-11-20 0:00): 31.75\n        Fri (2014-11-21 0:00): 31.75\n        Mon (2014-11-24 0:00): 25.11\n\n        forecast_0 = (2*29.75 + 31.89 + 31.75 + 31.75 + 25.11) / 6 \n                   = (59.5 + 31.89 + 31.75 + 31.75 + 25.11) / 6\n                   = 180.0 / 6 = 30.0\n\n    The last Tuesday at 0:00 was 29.75, and the Monday was 25.11. The average of 30.0 seems reasonable.\n\n 23. We'll use this method for each hour.\n\n 24. Steps for each hour h in 0 to 23:\n\n        h0: 2014-11-18 h, 2014-11-19 h, 2014-11-20 h, 2014-11-21 h, 2014-11-24 h\n\n        forecast = (2 * (2014-11-18 h) + (2014-11-19 h) + (2014-11-20 h) + (2014-11-21 h) + (2014-11-24 h)) / 6\n\n 25. But note: the data for 2014-11-19 is Wednesday, 2014-11-20 Thursday, 2014-11-21 Friday, and 2014-11-24 Monday.\n\n 26. We must be cautious: the weekend days (2014-11-22 and 2014-11-23) are not weekdays and we skip them.\n\n 27. Let's generate the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014-11-25 00:00 to 2014-11-25 23:00) using the above formula.\n\n 28. We write the forecast for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00): \n        Tue_prev (2014-11-18 00:00): 29.75\n        Wed (2014-11-19 00:00): 31.89\n        Thu (2014-11-20 00:00): 31.75\n        Fri (2014-11-21 00:00): 31.75\n        Mon (2014-11-24 00:00): 25.11\n        forecast = (2*29.75 + 31.89 + 31.75 + 31.75 + 25.11) / 6 = (59.5 + 31.89+31.75+31.75+25.11) = 180.0 / 6 = 30.0\n\n    Hour 1 (01:00):\n        Tue_prev: 29.29\n        Wed: 31.37\n        Thu: 31.09\n        Fri: 31.20\n        Mon: 23.99\n        forecast = (2*29.29 + 31.37 + 31.09 + 31.20 + 23.99) / 6 \n                 = (58.58 + 31.37+31.09+31.20+23.99) = 176.23 / 6 = 29.3717 -> round to 2 decimals: 29.37\n\n    We continue similarly.\n\n 29. We must do this for 24 hours.\n\n 30. However, note that the data for the last Tuesday (2014-11-18) is the same day of the week as the forecast day, so we give it double weight. The other weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri, and the Monday of the current week) are included with single weight.\n\n 31.
