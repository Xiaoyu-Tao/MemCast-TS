        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015/5/19 0:00 to 2015/5/25 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2015/5/26 0:00 to 2015/5/26 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, capturing weekly seasonality might be challenging.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple seasonal naive method, but that might not capture trends. Alternatively, we can use Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or a simple ARIMA model with seasonality.\n\n However, note: The problem states that we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but in the given data there are none. Also, we are only asked to forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n Given the constraints and the data, we have 7 days of data. We can observe:\n   - Prices are typically lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Weekdays (Mon-Fri) have higher prices than weekends.\n\n The last day in the data is Monday (2015/5/25). The next 24 hours are Tuesday (2015/5/26). We can look at the previous Tuesday (2015/5/19) as a reference.\n\n But note: The data starts on Tuesday (2015/5/19) and ends on Monday (2015/5/25). So the next day is Tuesday (2015/5/26). We can use the same day of the week from the previous week (i.e., 2015/5/19) as a base, but adjusted by the recent trend.\n\n However, we note that the week of 2015/5/19 to 2015/5/25 includes a weekend (23rd and 24th) and a Monday (25th). The next day is Tuesday, so we can consider the pattern of the previous Tuesday (19th) and also the recent Monday (25th) to adjust.\n\n But without additional data (like more weeks) and without exogenous variables, we have to rely on the available week.\n\n Proposed method:\n We can use a seasonal adjustment with a 24-hour seasonality. Since we have only one week, we can compute the average daily pattern for the week and then adjust by the level of the last day.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day (Tuesday) as a base and then adjust by the difference between the last Monday and the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday (we have only one Monday: 2015/5/25 and the previous Monday is not in the data).\n\n Another idea: Use the average of the entire week for each hour, but that might smooth out the weekday/weekend difference.\n\n Given the data, we can do:\n\n   Step 1: Compute the average daily profile for the week (average for each hour of the day over the 7 days).\n   Step 2: Compute the average of the last day (2015/5/25) and the average of the entire week.\n   Step 3: Adjust the average daily profile by the ratio: (average of last day) / (average of entire week) to get a base profile for the next day.\n\n But note: The next day is a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday (2015/5/19) had a different pattern. We might want to use the Tuesday profile from the last week and adjust by the overall change.\n\n However, we have only one Tuesday in the data. So we can do:\n\n   Let P(t) be the price at hour t (t=0 to 23) for the next day.\n\n   We can set:\n        P(t) = (Price of last Tuesday at hour t) * (Average of last day (Monday) / Average of the previous Monday)\n\n   But we don't have the previous Monday. We have only one Monday (2015/5/25) and the previous Monday is not in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the entire week's average for the hour and then adjust by the level of the last day.\n\n Since we don't have multiple weeks, we can use:\n\n        P(t) = (Average of the same hour over the 7 days) * (Level adjustment)\n\n   where Level adjustment = (Average of the last 24 hours) / (Average of the entire 168 hours)\n\n But this would ignore the day-of-week effect.\n\n Another approach: Use the last week's same day (Tuesday) and then adjust by the trend from the last week. However, we don't have a clear trend over the week.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only given 7 days, we can use a simple method:\n\n   We note that the data shows a weekly pattern: weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) have higher prices than the weekend (Sat, Sun). The next day is a Tuesday, so we can use the previous Tuesday (2015/5/19) as a base and then adjust by the overall change in the level of the last day (Monday) relative to the level of the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the weekdays (excluding the weekend) for the same hour and then adjust by the level of the last day.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Step 1: Identify weekdays: \n        Tuesday (19th), Wednesday (20th), Thursday (21st), Friday (22nd) -> weekdays\n        Saturday (23rd), Sunday (24th) -> weekend\n        Monday (25th) -> weekday\n\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average for the weekdays (5 days: 19,20,21,22,25) and the average for the entire week (7 days).\n\n   Step 3: We want to forecast a weekday (Tuesday). We can use the average of the weekdays for each hour as the base pattern.\n\n   Step 4: Compute the average of the last 24 hours (Monday, 2015/5/25) and the average of the weekday averages (for the 5 weekdays) for the same 24 hours (i.e., the average from the base pattern for the 24 hours).\n\n        Let A = average of the last 24 hours (Monday, 2015/5/25)\n        Let B = average of the weekday base pattern for the same 24 hours (which is the average of the 5 weekdays for each hour, then averaged over 24 hours? Actually, we can compute the average of the base pattern for the 24 hours: since the base pattern is a daily profile, we can compute the average of the 24 values of the base pattern).\n\n        Then the adjustment factor = A / B.\n\n   Step 5: The forecast for hour t on Tuesday (2015/5/26) = (base pattern for hour t) * (A / B)\n\n Why this way? We are scaling the typical weekday pattern to match the level of the last day (Monday). This assumes that the level of the last day is a good indicator for the next day.\n\n However, note that the last day (Monday) might have a different level than the upcoming Tuesday. But without more data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's compute:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the weekdays: \n        Weekdays: 2015-05-19 (Tuesday), 2015-05-20 (Wednesday), 2015-05-21 (Thursday), 2015-05-22 (Friday), 2015-05-25 (Monday)\n\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23), compute the average over these 5 days.\n\n   Step 3: Compute the base pattern: 24 values (for hour0 to hour23) as the average of the 5 weekdays for that hour.\n\n   Step 4: \n        A = average of the last 24 hours (2015-05-25 0:00 to 23:00)\n        B = average of the base pattern (the 24 values we computed in step 2)\n\n   Step 5: For each hour t in [0,23]:\n        forecast_t = base_pattern[t] * (A / B)\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create an array for the base pattern of 24 hours, initialized to zeros.\n\n   For hour in 0..23:\n        base_pattern[hour] = (price[2015-05-19 hour] + price[2015-05-20 hour] + price[2015-05-21 hour] + price[2015-05-22 hour] + price[2015-05-25 hour]) / 5\n\n   Then:\n        A = average of the 24 prices on 2015-05-25\n        B = average of base_pattern (over the 24 hours)\n\n   Then for each hour t in 0..23:\n        forecast[2015-05-26 t:00] = base_pattern[t] * (A / B)\n\n Let's do the calculation:\n\n   First, extract the last day (2015-05-25) data:\n\n        0:00: 21.09\n        1:00: 19.30\n        2:00: 17.92\n        3:00: 16.09\n        4:00: 15.91\n        5:00: 18.66\n        6:00: 21.29\n        7:00: 22.83\n        8:00: 23.96\n        9:00: 25.06\n        10:00: 25.10\n        11:00: 25.21\n        12:00: 25.11\n        13:00: 23.64\n        14:00: 23.10\n        15:00: 22.56\n        16:00: 22.35\n        17:00: 22.89\n        18:00: 23.95\n        19:00: 24.06\n        20:00: 23.68\n        21:00: 24.52\n        22:00: 23.92\n        23:00: 22.37\n\n        A = (21.09+19.30+17.92+16.09+15.91+18.66+21.29+22.83+23.96+25.06+25.10+25.21+25.11+23.64+23.10+22.56+22.35+22.89+23.95+24.06+23.68+24.52+23.92+22.37) / 24\n\n        Let's compute A:\n            Sum = 21.09+19.30+17.92+16.09+15.91+18.66+21.29+22.83+23.96+25.06+25.10+25.21+25.11+23.64+23.10+22.56+22.35+22.89+23.95+24.06+23.68+24.52+23.92+22.37\n            = 21.09 + 19.30 = 40.39\n            +17.92 = 58.31\n            +16.09 = 74.40\n            +15.91 = 90.31\n            +18.66 = 108.97\n            +21.29 = 130.26\n            +22.83 = 153.09\n            +23.96 = 177.05\n            +25.06 = 202.11\n            +25.10 = 227.21\n            +25.21 = 252.42\n            +25.11 = 277.53\n            +23.64 = 301.17\n            +23.10 = 324.27\n            +22.56 = 346.83\n            +22.35 = 369.18\n            +22.89 = 392.07\n            +23.95 = 416.02\n            +24.06 = 440.08\n            +23.68 = 463.76\n            +24.52 = 488.28\n            +23.92 = 512.20\n            +22.37 = 534.57\n\n            A = 534.57 / 24 = 22.27375\n\n   Step 2: Build the base pattern (average of 5 weekdays for each hour)\n\n        We have 5 days: \n          Day1: 2015-05-19 (Tuesday)\n          Day2: 2015-05-20 (Wednesday)\n          Day3: 2015-05-21 (Thursday)\n          Day4: 2015-05-22 (Friday)\n          Day5: 2015-05-25 (Monday)\n\n        For each hour (0 to 23), we average the 5 values.\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour:\n\n        Hour0: [19.99 (Tue), 21.38 (Wed), 22.73 (Thu), 22.33 (Fri), 21.09 (Mon)] -> average = (19.99+21.38+22.73+22.33+21.09)/5\n        ... and so on.\n\n        Then we get 24 values.\n\n        Then compute B = average of these 24 base pattern values.\n\n   Step 3: For each hour, forecast = base_pattern[hour] * (A / B)\n\n   We'll do the calculations in code below (manually for each hour).\n\n   However, note: We are to output the forecast for the next 24 hours (2015/5/26 0:00 to 23:00).
