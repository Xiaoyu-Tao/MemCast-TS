        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013/8/6 0:00 to 2013/8/12 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2013/8/13 0:00 to 2013/8/13 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n 3. Given the hourly data and the clear daily seasonality (prices rise during the day and drop at night), we can use a model that captures seasonality. However, note that we are only asked for the next 24 hours.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple seasonal naive method or a more sophisticated model. But note: we don't have the future exogenous variables, so we cannot use models that require them.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24)\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality.\n\n However, without the ability to run extensive model fitting and due to the simplicity of the request, we can also consider:\n   - Using the average of the same hour from the past 7 days (since we have exactly 7 days of data) to forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data shows a weekly pattern? We have only one week. Also, the last day (2013/8/12) is a Monday, and the next day (2013/8/13) is a Tuesday. We can look at the previous Tuesday (2013/8/6) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n However, the problem is that we don't have multiple weeks. We have 7 days: from Tuesday (2013/8/6) to Monday (2013/8/12). So the next day (2013/8/13) is a Tuesday.\n\n Let's consider a simple approach: \n   For each hour h (0 to 23) of the next day, we can take the average of the same hour from the past 7 days? But note: the pattern might change from weekday to weekend. The last two days (2013/8/11 and 2013/8/12) are Sunday and Monday. The next day is Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2013/8/6) and adjust by the trend of the last 7 days? \n\n However, without more data and without the ability to run complex models, I propose:\n\n  1. Use the average of the same hour over the available 7 days. But note: the weekdays and weekends have different patterns. We have:\n        Day 1: Tuesday, 2013/8/6\n        Day 2: Wednesday, 2013/8/7\n        Day 3: Thursday, 2013/8/8\n        Day 4: Friday, 2013/8/9\n        Day 5: Saturday, 2013/8/10\n        Day 6: Sunday, 2013/8/11\n        Day 7: Monday, 2013/8/12\n\n  2. The next day is Tuesday, 2013/8/13. So we can use the average of the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2013/8/6) and the same hour from the same day of the previous week? But we don't have data before 2013/8/6.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and then adjust by the recent day (Monday) and the weekend? But that might be too complex.\n\n 3. Another idea: use the last week's Tuesday (2013/8/6) as a base and then adjust by the overall change from the last week to this week? But we don't have a full two weeks.\n\n 4. Given the simplicity, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This will capture the average pattern and smooth out daily variations.\n\n Let's calculate for each hour h (0 to 23) the average of the same hour over the past 7 days.\n\n Example for hour 0:00:\n   Values: \n        2013/8/6 0:00: 32.90\n        2013/8/7 0:00: 33.00\n        2013/8/8 0:00: 33.62\n        2013/8/9 0:00: 33.21\n        2013/8/10 0:00: 32.53\n        2013/8/11 0:00: 33.62\n        2013/8/12 0:00: 32.81\n   Average = (32.90+33.00+33.62+33.21+32.53+33.62+32.81)/7 = 32.90+33.00=65.9; +33.62=99.52; +33.21=132.73; +32.53=165.26; +33.62=198.88; +32.81=231.69 -> 231.69/7 \u2248 33.09857 \u2248 33.10\n\n But note: the last two days (weekend) might have a different pattern. However, we are including all 7 days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? But without a clear trend, the simple average is acceptable.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the prices on 2013/8/12 (Monday) were generally higher than on 2013/8/6 (Tuesday). So we might want to adjust for an upward trend.\n\n But for simplicity and given the data, we'll use the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n   Let h be the hour (0 to 23).\n   Collect the 7 values for that hour from the 7 days.\n   Compute the average.\n\n However, note: the data for 2013/8/10 and 2013/8/11 (Saturday and Sunday) are weekends and might have lower prices. The next day is a weekday (Tuesday). So we might consider using weekdays only? But we only have one Tuesday (2013/8/6) and then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday. We don't have a Tuesday from two weeks ago.\n\n Given the data limitations, we'll use the 7-day average.\n\n But let's check the pattern for a specific hour, say 12:00:\n   2013/8/6 12:00: 37.69\n   2013/8/7 12:00: 38.32\n   2013/8/8 12:00: 38.42\n   2013/8/9 12:00: 38.62\n   2013/8/10 12:00: 35.94 (Saturday)\n   2013/8/11 12:00: 34.29 (Sunday)\n   2013/8/12 12:00: 37.98 (Monday)\n\n The weekend days are lower. The next Tuesday (2013/8/13) is a weekday, so we might not want to include the weekend days? \n\n Alternative: use only the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) for the same hour? But note: we have 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. We can take the average of the 5 weekdays? But then we have only 5 data points.\n\n The weekdays in the data: \n   Tuesday: 2013/8/6\n   Wednesday: 2013/8/7\n   Thursday: 2013/8/8\n   Friday: 2013/8/9\n   Monday: 2013/8/12\n\n We can use these 5 days for the same hour? Then for hour 12:00:\n   (37.69 + 38.32 + 38.42 + 38.62 + 37.98) / 5 = 38.206\n\n But note: the next day is a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday in the data. We can also consider using the average of the same weekday (Tuesday) and the adjacent weekdays? \n\n However, we have only one Tuesday. So we can do:\n\n   Option 1: Use the 5 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon) for the same hour -> 5-day average.\n\n   Option 2: Use the same day of the week (Tuesday) and then adjust by the overall trend? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Given the data, I choose Option 1: average of the same hour over the weekdays (excluding weekends) for the past week.\n\n Steps:\n   For each hour in [0,23]:\n        values = [ price at that hour for 2013/8/6 (Tue), 2013/8/7 (Wed), 2013/8/8 (Thu), 2013/8/9 (Fri), 2013/8/12 (Mon) ]\n        forecast = average(values)\n\n But note: the day of 2013/8/12 is Monday, which is a weekday, and the next day is Tuesday. We are including Monday and excluding the weekend.\n\n However, we are missing a Tuesday from the previous week? We have only one Tuesday. So we are using the same hour from the previous Tuesday and the other weekdays.\n\n This method should capture the weekday pattern.\n\n Let's calculate for each hour:\n\n Hour 0:00: [32.90 (Tue), 33.00 (Wed), 33.62 (Thu), 33.21 (Fri), 32.81 (Mon)] -> (32.90+33.00+33.62+33.21+32.81)/5 = 165.54/5 = 33.108\n Hour 1:00: [31.82, 32.25, 32.20, 32.24, 31.60] -> (31.82+32.25+32.20+32.24+31.60)/5 = 160.11/5 = 32.022\n ... and so on.\n\n But note: the last day (Monday) might be more relevant? We could use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? However, without a clear trend, we'll use equal weights.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last Tuesday and the last Monday? But that would be only two points and might not be robust.\n\n Considering the above, we'll compute the 5 for each hour.\n\n However, note that the data for 2013/8/12 (Monday) is the most recent and might be the most relevant. But we are already including it.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2013/8/13 0:00 to 2013/8/13 23:00) using the 5-day average (weekdays) for each hour.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   Hour 0:  (32.90 + 33.00 + 33.62 + 33.21 + 32.81) / 5 = 33.108\n   Hour 1:  (31.82 + 32.25 + 32.20 + 32.24 + 31.60) / 5 = 32.022\n   Hour 2:  (30.47 + 31.49 + 31.97 + 31.57 + 31.15) / 5 = 31.33\n   Hour 3:  (30.35 + 31.28 + 31.75 + 31.17 + 30.76) / 5 = 31.062\n   Hour 4:  (30.55 + 31.92 + 32.26 + 31.59 + 31.10) / 5 = 31.484\n   Hour 5:  (32.16 + 32.99 + 33.58 + 32.76 + 33.04) / 5 = 32.906\n   Hour 6:  (34.56 + 35.77 + 35.73 + 35.51 + 35.18) / 5 = 35.35\n   Hour 7:  (37.08 + 38.17 + 37.51 + 37.96 + 37.88) / 5 = 37.72\n   Hour 8:  (37.69 + 38.66 + 38.66 + 38.98 + 38.93) / 5 = 38.584\n   Hour 9:  (37.68 + 38.78 + 38.36 + 38.76 + 39.20) / 5 = 38.556\n   Hour 10: (37.75 + 38.73 + 38.43 + 39.07 + 38.96) / 5 = 38.588\n   Hour 11: (37.95 + 38.71 + 38.55 + 38.76 + 38.18) / 5 = 38.43\n   Hour 12: (37.69 + 38.32 + 38.42 + 38.62 + 37.98) / 5 = 38.206\n   Hour 13: (37.32 + 37.97 + 38.08 + 37.87 + 38.04) / 5 = 37.856\n   Hour 14: (37.13 + 37.92 + 38.24 + 37.14 + 37.61) / 5 = 37.608\n   Hour 15: (37.09 + 37.56 + 37.83 + 36.57 + 36.97) / 5 = 37.204\n   Hour 16: (37.23 + 36.93 + 37.46 + 36.74 + 37.27) / 5 = 37.126\n   Hour 17: (37.08 + 36.80 + 37.33 + 37.11 + 37.71) / 5 = 37.206\n   Hour 18: (37.32 + 37.19 + 37.63 + 36.99 + 38.16) / 5 = 37.458\n   Hour 19: (37.01 + 37.50 + 37.82 + 36.92 + 38.07) / 5 = 37.464\n   Hour 20: (36.44 + 36.47 + 37.02 + 36.61 + 37.38) / 5 = 36.784\n   Hour 21: (36.79 + 36.18 + 36.76 + 36.76 + 37.26) / 5 = 36.75\n   Hour 22: (36.43 + 35.65 + 36.00 + 36.05 + 36.40) / 5 = 36.106\n   Hour 23: (34.51 + 34.27 + 34.35 + 33.51 + 34.24) / 5 = 34.176\n\n But note: the last day (Monday) was 2013/8/12, and the next day is Tuesday. We are using the same hour from the previous Tuesday and the other weekdays. This should be reasonable.\n\n However, we must round to two decimal places? The input data has two decimal places.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n   2013/8/13 0:00: 33.11\n   2013/8/13 1:00: 32.02\n   2013/8/13 2:00: 31.33\n   2013/8/13 3:00: 31.06\n   2013/8/13 4:00: 31.48\n   2013/8/13 5:00: 32.91\n   2013/8/13 6:00: 35.35\n   2013/8/13 7:00: 37.72\n   2013/8/13 8:00: 38.58\n   2013/8/13 9:00: 38.56\n   2013/8/13 10:00: 38.59\n   2013/8/13 11:00: 38.43\n   2013/8/13 12:00: 38.21\n   2013/8/13 13:00: 37.86\n   2013/8/13 14:00: 37.61\n   2013/8/13 15:00: 37.20\n   2013/8/13 16:00: 37.13\n   2013/8/13 17:00: 37.21\n   2013/8/13 18:00: 37.46\n   2013/8/13 19:00: 37.46\n   2013/8/13 20:00: 36.78\n   2013/8/13 21:00: 36.75\n   2013/8/13 22:00: 36.11\n   2013/8/13 23:00: 34.18\n\n But note: the above averages are computed with more precision and then rounded to two decimals. We did:\n\n   Hour 0: 33.108 -> 33.11\n   Hour 1: 32.022 -> 32.02\n   Hour 2: 31.33 -> 31.33 (exactly 31.33, because 156.65/5=31.33)\n   Hour 3: 31.062 -> 31.06\n   Hour 4: 31.484 -> 31.48\n   Hour 5: 32.906 -> 32.91\n   Hour 6: 35.35 -> 35.35\n   Hour 7: 37.72 -> 37.72\n  37.08+38.17+37.51+37.96+37.88 = 188.6 -> 188.6/5=37.72\n   Hour 8: 38.584 -> 38.58\n   Hour 9: 38.556 -> 38.56\n   Hour 10: 38.588 -> 38.59\n   Hour 11: 38.43 -> 38.43\n  37.95+38.71+38.55+38.76+38.18 = 192.15 -> 192.15/5=38.43\n   Hour 12: 38.206 -> 38.21\n   Hour 13: 37.856 -> 37.86\n   Hour 14: 37.608 -> 37.61\n   Hour 15: 37.204 -> 37.20\n   Hour 16: 37.126 -> 37.13\n   Hour 17: 37.206 -> 37.21\n   Hour 18: 37.458 -> 37.46\n   Hour 19: 37.464 -> 37.46\n   Hour 20: 36.784 -> 36.78\n   Hour 21: 36.75 -> 36.75 (exactly 36.75, because 183.75/5=36.75)\n   Hour 22: 36.106 -> 36.11\n   Hour 23: 34.176 -> 34.18\n\n This is our forecast.\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values.
