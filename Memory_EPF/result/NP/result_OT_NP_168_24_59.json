        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/2/18 0:00 to 2014/2/24 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/2/25 0:00 to 2014/2/25 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Since we don't have the other variables, we must rely solely on the historical price data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values in the provided data. Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) without any gaps. So no missing values in the provided history.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Since we don't have exogenous variables, we can use a time series model that captures the daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows clear daily patterns (prices are higher during the day and lower at night) and also weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n 3. Given the context, we can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: \n    - We can compute the average of the same hour of the previous days (e.g., for 2014/2/25 0:00, average the prices of 0:00 from 2014/2/18 to 2014/2/24) and adjust for any trend or recent changes? \n    - Alternatively, we can use the last week's same hour as a forecast? But note that 2014/2/24 is a Monday and 2014/2/25 is a Tuesday. So we can take the average of the previous Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the data (2014/2/18 was a Tuesday?).\n\n Let's check the days:\n  2014/2/18: Tuesday\n  2014/2/19: Wednesday\n  2014/2/20: Thursday\n  2014/2/21: Friday\n  2014/2/22: Saturday\n  2014/2/23: Sunday\n  2014/2/24: Monday\n\n So the next day 2014/2/25 is a Tuesday. We have one full week of data and the same day of the previous week (2014/2/18) was a Tuesday.\n\n 4. However, using only one Tuesday might not be robust. We can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include different days of the week. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week for the available weeks? But we only have one previous Tuesday.\n\n 5. Another approach: use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour. Since we have 7 days, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? Or use exponential smoothing? But without more data, it's challenging.\n\n 6. Given the constraints, we can use a naive method: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) for Tuesday? But that might not capture the weekly pattern. Alternatively, use the same hour from the same day last week (Tuesday) and adjust by the trend of the last week? \n\n 7. Considering the data, we see that the prices on 2014/2/24 (Monday) were generally lower than on 2014/2/18 (Tuesday). So we might expect a similar pattern as 2014/2/18 but adjusted to the current level.\n\n 8. We can compute the average price for each day and then adjust the previous Tuesday's hourly pattern by the ratio of the current level (e.g., average of last 7 days) to the level of the previous Tuesday? \n\n However, note that we are only asked for a forecast and we don't have the exogenous variables. Since the problem states that we are an expert, we must use a reasonable method.\n\n 9. Let's try a simple method: \n    For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (Tuesday, 2014/2/25):\n        forecast_h = (price of the same hour h on the previous Tuesday (2014/2/18) + price of the same hour h on the most recent day (Monday, 2014/2/24)) / 2\n\n Why? Because we have only one Tuesday in the history, so we combine it with the most recent day (which is Monday) to account for recent conditions.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would mix weekdays and weekends. We note that weekends have lower prices. Since Tuesday is a weekday, we might want to use only weekdays? But we have only one full week.\n\n 11. Considering the data, we can see that the prices on 2014/2/24 (Monday) are lower than on 2014/2/18 (Tuesday). So we can take a weighted average? \n\n 12. Another idea: use the same hour from the same day last week (2014/2/18) and then adjust by the difference between the last two days (Monday and Sunday) and the same two days in the previous week? \n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only using the target variable, a simpler method is to use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But we don't have three Tuesdays.\n\n 14. We decide to use: \n     forecast_h = (price_h_last_tuesday * 0.7 + price_h_yesterday * 0.3) \n     Why? Because the same day last week is more relevant for the weekly pattern, but we also want to account for the recent trend. We give more weight to the same day last week (0.7) and less to the same hour yesterday (0.3) because yesterday was Monday and today is Tuesday, so the pattern of Tuesday last week is more representative.\n\n 15. But note: yesterday (2014/2/24) was Monday and the same day last week was 2014/2/17? But we don't have 2014/2/17. We only have 2014/2/18 to 2014/2/24. So we have only one Tuesday (2014/2/18) and one Monday (2014/2/24). \n\n 16. Therefore, for each hour h in [0,23]:\n        last_tuesday_h = price at hour h on 2014/2/18\n        yesterday_h = price at hour h on 2014/2/24 (Monday)\n\n        forecast_h = 0.7 * last_tuesday_h + 0.3 * yesterday_h\n\n 17. Why 0.7 and 0.3? It's arbitrary but we assume that the same day of the week is more important. We can adjust the weights if we have more data, but we don't.\n\n 18. Let's test on a known point: for example, the price at 2014/2/18 0:00 was 29.96 and at 2014/2/24 0:00 was 24.07. Then the forecast for 2014/2/25 0:00 would be: 0.7*29.96 + 0.3*24.07 = 20.972 + 7.221 = 28.193.\n\n 19. But we can also consider that the overall level of prices has been decreasing. So this might be reasonable.\n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use a different method: \n        forecast_h = yesterday_h * (last_tuesday_h / the_monday_before_last_tuesday) \n     But we don't have the Monday before 2014/2/18 (which would be 2014/2/17).\n\n 21. Given the data limitations, we stick with the weighted average.\n\n 22. We compute for each hour from 0 to 23 for the day 2014/2/25.\n\n 23. Let's extract the data for 2014/2/18 (Tuesday) and 2014/2/24 (Monday):\n\n     2014/2/18 (Tuesday):\n        0:00: 29.96\n        1:00: 29.85\n        2:00: 29.36\n        3:00: 28.85\n        4:00: 29.19\n        5:00: 30.54\n        6:00: 31.62\n        7:00: 32.90\n        8:00: 33.05\n        9:00: 32.92\n        10:00: 32.70\n        11:00: 32.25\n        12:00: 31.75\n        13:00: 31.75\n        14:00: 32.18\n        15:00: 32.22\n        16:00: 32.55\n        17:00: 34.12\n        18:00: 34.09\n        19:00: 32.93\n        20:00: 32.08\n        21:00: 31.66\n        22:00: 31.19\n        23:00: 30.32\n\n     2014/2/24 (Monday):\n        0:00: 24.07\n        1:00: 23.49\n        2:00: 23.38\n        3:00: 23.45\n        4:00: 24.12\n        5:00: 25.75\n        6:00: 28.91\n        7:00: 29.74\n        8:00: 29.95\n        9:00: 29.62\n        10:00: 29.05\n        11:00: 28.58\n        12:00: 27.84\n        13:00: 27.83\n        14:00: 28.15\n        15:00: 28.75\n        16:00: 29.15\n        17:00: 29.66\n        18:00: 29.68\n        19:00: 29.37\n        20:00: 28.80\n        21:00: 28.34\n        22:00: 27.42\n        23:00: 26.06\n\n 24. Now, for each hour, we compute:\n        forecast = 0.7 * (value on 2014/2/18) + 0.3 * (value on 2014/2/24)\n\n 25. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n     0.7 * 29.96 + 0.3 * 24.07 = 20.972 + 7.221 = 28.193 -> 28.19\n\n 26. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 27. The forecasted day is 2014/2/25, so the timestamps will be:\n        2014/2/25 0:00\n        2014/2/25 1:00\n        ...\n        2014/2/25 23:00\n\n 28.

We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple heuristic. In practice, one would use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning models) and without exogenous variables.
