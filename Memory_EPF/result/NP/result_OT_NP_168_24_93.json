        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-10-14 00:00 to 2014-10-20 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014-10-21 00:00 to 2014-10-21 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The data provided seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). However, we note that the data for 2014-10-20 has a value of 10.81 at 3:00 which is unusually low compared to adjacent hours. But since we are not given any other features (like grid load or wind power) and the task is to forecast only based on the historical price, we must rely on the given time series.\n\n 2. Approach: We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the strong daily seasonality (as seen in the data: prices are higher during the day and lower at night, and also the pattern on weekdays vs weekends), we can use a seasonal naive method or a simple averaging of the same hours from previous days. However, note that the last day in the data (2014-10-20) is a Monday, and the next 24 hours are for 2014-10-21 (Tuesday). We have data for the previous Tuesday (2014-10-14) and also the pattern of the week.\n\n 3. Considering the data, we can see that weekdays (Monday to Friday) have similar patterns: \n    - Low during the night (0:00 to 5:00)\n    - Rise in the morning (6:00 to 8:00)\n    - High during the day (9:00 to 17:00) with a peak in the morning and then a slight dip and then a peak in the evening?\n    - Then decrease in the evening and night.\n\n 4. However, we note that the weekend (2014-10-18 and 2014-10-19) had lower prices and a different pattern. Also, 2014-10-20 (Monday) had a very low price at 3:00 (10.81) which might be an outlier.\n\n 5. Since we are only given the price and no other features, we can use a simple method:\n    - Use the average of the same hour of the previous days (for example, for the next 00:00, average the 00:00 of the last 7 days) but adjust for the day of the week.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day (i.e., Tuesday, 2014-10-14) as a base, but adjust with the recent trend. However, the recent Monday (2014-10-20) had a pattern that is different from the previous Monday (2014-10-13, which is not provided) so we don't have a direct same day from last week for Tuesday? Actually, we have the Tuesday of the previous week (2014-10-14) in the data.\n\n 7. We have:\n      Previous Tuesday: 2014-10-14\n      Wednesday: 2014-10-15\n      Thursday: 2014-10-16\n      Friday: 2014-10-17\n      Saturday: 2014-10-18\n      Sunday: 2014-10-19\n      Monday: 2014-10-20\n\n 8. We are to forecast Tuesday, 2014-10-21.\n\n 9. One simple approach: use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But the weekend days are different. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week for the last few weeks, but we only have one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days, so we have one Tuesday (2014-10-14). \n\n 10. Since we only have one Tuesday, we can use the average of the same hour from the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the previous Tuesday? But that might not be consistent.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days and also to the same day of the previous week.\n\n 12. However, note that the problem does not require a complex model. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n 13. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we are only given 168 hours, we can do:\n\n     Option 1: Use the same day from the previous week (2014-10-14) as the forecast for 2014-10-21. But we note that the overall level of prices might have changed. For example, the Monday (2014-10-20) had a very low value at 3:00 and also the Sunday (2014-10-19) had lower prices than the previous Sunday (which we don't have, but we have the Sunday in the data as 2014-10-19 and the previous Sunday was 2014-10-12, not in the data). \n\n     Option 2: Use the average of the last 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for each hour? But the pattern of a Tuesday is different from Saturday, Sunday.\n\n 14. We can try to adjust the previous Tuesday (2014-10-14) by the trend of the last week. How? We can compute the average price of the last 7 days and the average price of the 7 days of the previous week? But we don't have the week before.\n\n 15. Actually, we only have one week of data. So we can do:\n\n     Let F(t) for t in [00:00, 01:00, ... 23:00] for Tuesday 2014-10-21 be:\n\n        F(t) = (1 - alpha) * (the value of the same hour t on 2014-10-14) + alpha * (the value of the same hour t on 2014-10-20) \n\n     But note: 2014-10-20 is Monday and 2014-10-14 is Tuesday. The pattern of Monday and Tuesday are similar? We can use the Monday (2014-10-20) as a reference for the next day? Actually, we are forecasting Tuesday, so we can use the previous day (Monday) as a base and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the Monday of that week? \n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Friday, Monday, and the previous Tuesday) but note that Friday and Monday are adjacent to the weekend.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and without more data, a safe approach is to use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which are Sunday, Monday, and Saturday) but that includes weekend days. \n\n 18. We note that the data for 2014-10-20 (Monday) has a pattern that is more similar to a weekday, so we can use:\n\n     For each hour t (0 to 23):\n        F(t) = (P_prev_tuesday(t) + P_mon(t)) / 2\n\n     where P_prev_tuesday(t) is the price at hour t on 2014-10-14, and P_mon(t) is the price at hour t on 2014-10-20.\n\n 19. But we note that the previous Tuesday (2014-10-14) was a week ago and the market conditions might have changed. Also, the Monday (2014-10-20) had a very low value at 3:00 (10.81) which might be an anomaly. We can smooth that by including more days? \n\n 20. Since the data is limited, we can use the median of the same hour for the last 7 days to avoid the effect of outliers? For example, at 3:00, the last 7 days values are:\n\n        2014-10-14 3:00: 31.05\n        2014-10-15 3:00: 30.53\n        2014-10-16 3:00: 30.18\n        2014-10-17 3:00: 30.67\n        2014-10-18 3:00: 30.67\n        2014-10-19 3:00: 23.17\n        2014-10-20 3:00: 10.81   -> This is an outlier.\n\n 21. For each hour, we can take the median of the last 7 days? But the median for 3:00 would be 30.53 (sorted: 10.81, 23.17, 30.18, 30.53, 30.67, 30.67, 31.05 -> median is 30.53). However, the median might be too low for a Tuesday? \n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the average after removing the min and max for that hour over the last 7 days? \n\n 23. Given the time, we decide to use the median for each hour to avoid the effect of extreme values. This is a robust method.\n\n 24. Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of the day to be forecasted (2014-10-21):\n        - Collect the 7 values for that hour from the last 7 days (2014-10-14 to 2014-10-20).\n        - Sort the 7 values and take the median (the 4th value).\n\n 25. Why median? Because it is robust to outliers. For example, at 3:00 we have an outlier (10.81) and a low value (23.17) from Sunday, but the median (30.53) is more representative of a typical weekday.\n\n 26. Let's compute a few to see:\n\n     Hour 0: \n        [31.76 (14th), 31.12 (15th), 30.54 (16th), 31.05 (17th), 31.02 (18th), 26.97 (19th), 20.92 (20th)]\n        Sorted: 20.92, 26.97, 30.54, 31.02, 31.05, 31.12, 31.76 -> median = 31.02\n\n     Hour 3: \n        [31.05, 30.53, 30.18, 30.67, 30.67, 23.17, 10.81] -> sorted: 10.81, 23.17, 30.18, 30.53, 30.67, 30.67, 31.05 -> median = 30.53\n\n     Hour 7: \n        [36.10, 35.86, 37.20, 35.54, 31.90, 27.54, 32.27] -> sorted: 27.54, 31.90, 32.27, 35.54, 35.86, 36.10, 37.20 -> median = 35.54\n\n     This seems reasonable.\n\n 27. Therefore, we will forecast each hour of 2014-10-21 as the median of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n 28. We must be cautious: the median might smooth too much? But without more data and given the simplicity, it is acceptable.\n\n 29. Let's compute the 24 medians:\n\n    Hour 0: [31.76, 31.12, 30.54, 31.05, 31.02, 26.97, 20.92] -> sorted: 20.92, 26.97, 30.54, 31.02, 31.05, 31.12, 31.76 -> median = 31.02\n    Hour 1: [31.23, 30.77, 30.25, 30.80, 30.80, 24.13, 18.08] -> sorted: 18.08, 24.13, 30.25, 30.77, 30.80, 30.80, 31.23 -> median = 30.77\n    Hour 2: [31.06, 30.57, 30.09, 30.53, 30.70, 23.09, 16.50] -> sorted: 16.50, 23.09, 30.09, 30.53, 30.57, 30.70, 31.06 -> median = 30.53\n    Hour 3: [31.05, 30.53, 30.18, 30.67, 30.67, 23.17, 10.81] -> sorted: 10.81, 23.17, 30.18, 30.53, 30.67, 30.67, 31.05 -> median = 30.53\n    Hour 4: [31.37, 31.04, 30.69, 30.88, 30.63, 24.47, 17.50] -> sorted: 17.50, 24.47, 30.63, 30.69, 30.88, 31.04, 31.37 -> median = 30.69\n    Hour 5: [32.14, 31.69, 31.32, 31.37, 30.68, 25.11, 25.91] -> sorted: 25.11, 25.91, 30.68, 31.32, 31.37, 31.69, 32.14 -> median = 31.32\n    Hour 6: [34.05, 33.57, 33.57, 33.52, 30.91, 26.72, 30.88] -> sorted: 26.72, 30.88, 30.91, 33.52, 33.57, 33.57, 34.05 -> median = 33.52\n    Hour 7: [36.10, 35.86, 37.20, 35.54, 31.90, 27.54, 32.27] -> sorted: 27.54, 31.90, 32.27, 35.54, 35.86, 36.10, 37.20 -> median = 35.54\n    Hour 8: [36.68, 36.82, 37.75, 36.04, 32.85, 29.04, 32.66] -> sorted: 29.04, 32.66, 32.85, 36.04, 36.68, 36.82, 37.75 -> median = 36.04\n    Hour 9: [36.38, 36.54, 37.20, 36.05, 33.20, 29.89, 32.67] -> sorted: 29.89, 32.67, 33.20, 36.05, 36.38, 36.54, 37.20 -> median = 36.05\n    Hour 10: [36.18, 36.27, 37.48, 35.95, 32.91, 30.38, 32.38] -> sorted: 30.38, 32.38, 32.91, 35.95, 36.18, 36.27, 37.48 -> median = 35.95\n    Hour 11: [35.81, 35.95, 36.79, 35.52, 32.22, 30.56, 31.97] -> sorted: 30.56, 31.97, 32.22, 35.52, 35.81, 35.95, 36.79 -> median = 35.52\n    Hour 12: [34.94, 35.32, 35.63, 34.63, 31.78, 30.58, 31.42] -> sorted: 30.58, 31.42, 31.78, 34.63, 34.94, 35.32, 35.63 -> median = 34.63\n    Hour 13: [34.57, 35.12, 35.42, 34.14, 31.44, 30.30, 31.42] -> sorted: 30.30, 31.42, 31.44, 34.14, 34.57, 35.12, 35.42 -> median = 34.14\n    Hour 14: [34.32, 34.94, 35.28, 33.85, 30.99, 30.12, 31.39] -> sorted: 30.12, 30.99, 31.39, 33.85, 34.32, 34.94, 35.28 -> median = 33.85\n    Hour 15: [34.84, 34.85, 35.02, 33.86, 30.93, 29.86, 31.72] -> sorted: 29.86, 30.93, 31.72, 33.86, 34.84, 34.85, 35.02 -> median = 33.86\n    Hour 16: [35.61, 34.62, 34.96, 33.81, 31.13, 30.15, 32.14] -> sorted: 30.15, 31.13, 32.14, 33.81, 34.62, 34.96, 35.61 -> median = 33.81\n    Hour 17: [36.23, 35.24, 35.67, 34.62, 32.72, 30.78, 33.08] -> sorted: 30.78, 32.72, 33.08, 34.62, 35.24, 35.67, 36.23 -> median = 34.62\n    Hour 18: [36.32, 36.02, 36.94, 35.56, 33.36, 31.45, 33.73] -> sorted: 31.45, 33.36, 33.73, 35.56, 36.02, 36.32, 36.94 -> median = 35.56\n    Hour 19: [36.04, 35.75, 36.19, 34.61, 33.01, 31.67, 33.60] -> sorted: 31.67, 33.01, 33.60, 34.61, 35.75, 36.04, 36.19 -> median = 34.61\n    Hour 20: [34.96, 34.49, 34.99, 33.60, 31.83, 30.80, 32.95] -> sorted: 30.80, 31.83, 32.95, 33.60, 34.49, 34.96, 34.99 -> median = 33.60\n    Hour 21: [33.97, 33.64, 33.78, 32.85, 30.85, 30.51, 32.26] -> sorted: 30.51, 30.85, 32.26, 32.85, 33.64, 33.78, 33.97 -> median = 32.85\n    Hour 22: [33.18, 32.77, 32.19, 31.94, 30.47, 29.79, 31.39] -> sorted: 29.79, 30.47, 31.39, 31.94, 32.19, 32.77, 33.18 -> median = 31.94\n    Hour 23: [32.14, 31.73, 31.50, 31.33, 29.38, 28.10, 30.18] -> sorted: 28.10, 29.38, 30.18, 31.33, 31.50, 31.73, 32.14 -> median = 31.33\n\n 30.
