        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (7 days * 24 hours). We need to forecast the next 24 hours.\n The data is from 2014/12/9 0:00 to 2014/12/15 23:00 (inclusive). The next 24 hours would be from 2014/12/16 0:00 to 2014/12/16 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 records). But we are told that some data may contain missing values. \n    However, in this specific dataset, we have 168 consecutive hours without any missing value.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on a univariate time series model.\n\n 3. Given the hourly data, we can expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, the data only covers one week (7 days) so weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n 4. We can use a simple model like a seasonal naive model, which uses the value from the same hour of the previous day (or same hour of the previous week) as the forecast.\n\n    Considering the data shows a clear daily pattern (prices are higher during the day and lower at night), we can use:\n        Forecast for hour h of day d = Observed value at hour h of day d-1\n\n    But note: the last day we have is 2014/12/15 (Monday). The next day is 2014/12/16 (Tuesday). \n    We can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday? But we only have one week of data.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But that might smooth out the pattern.\n\n    However, the problem says we are an expert and we are to forecast. Since we have only the target series and no other variables, and the data is limited (only 7 days), \n    we can use a simple method: the seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours.\n\n    So: \n        y_{t+24} = y_t   for t being the current time.\n\n    But note: we are at the last time point (2014/12/15 23:00). Then:\n        For 2014/12/16 0:00: use 2014/12/15 0:00? -> 27.31? \n        But wait, 2014/12/15 0:00 was 27.31, but 2014/12/15 0:00 is Monday 0:00. \n        We are forecasting Tuesday 0:00. We might use the previous Tuesday? But we don't have a Tuesday in the data? Actually, the first day is 2014/12/9 (Tuesday). \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the same day of the previous week? \n        For 2014/12/16 (Tuesday) 0:00: use 2014/12/9 (Tuesday) 0:00? -> 31.41\n\n    But note: the data from 2014/12/9 (Tuesday) to 2014/12/15 (Monday) is 7 days. So we have one full week.\n\n    We can use a weekly seasonal naive: \n        Forecast for 2014/12/16 0:00 = 2014/12/9 0:00 (31.41)\n        Forecast for 2014/12/16 1:00 = 2014/12/9 1:00 (30.93)\n        ... and so on.\n\n    However, let's check the pattern of the week: \n        The week from 2014/12/9 (Tuesday) to 2014/12/15 (Monday) might have a weekly pattern? \n        But we only have one week, so we cannot see if the pattern repeats. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? \n\n    But note: the problem says we are to forecast the next 24 hours. We must provide 24 values.\n\n    Considering the simplicity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, and that we are an expert, we can choose:\n\n    Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) for each hour.\n\n    Option 2: Use the previous day (i.e., 1 day ago) for each hour.\n\n    However, the data shows that the pattern of Monday (2014/12/15) is different from the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday. \n    Actually, the first day is Tuesday and the last day is Monday. So we have one Tuesday (2014/12/9) and one Monday (2014/12/15). \n\n    We can compare the Monday (2014/12/15) with the previous Monday? We don't have it. \n\n    Therefore, we can use the same hour from the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) because we have exactly one week of data.\n\n    But note: the week might have a trend? We don't have multiple weeks to check.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without a library, we have to do it manually.\n\n    Given the constraints, I choose the weekly naive: use the same hour from the same day of the previous week.\n\n    Why? Because we have exactly 7 days of data and we are forecasting the next day (which is a Tuesday, and we have a Tuesday from 7 days ago).\n\n    Steps for the forecast:\n\n        For hour 0: 2014/12/16 0:00 -> use 2014/12/9 0:00 (31.41)\n        For hour 1: 2014/12/16 1:00 -> use 2014/12/9 1:00 (30.93)\n        ... until hour 23: 2014/12/16 23:00 -> use 2014/12/9 23:00 (29.56)\n\n    But wait: the data for 2014/12/9 23:00 is 29.56.\n\n    However, let's check the data: \n        2014/12/9 (Tuesday): \n            0:00: 31.41\n            1:00: 30.93\n            ... \n            23:00: 29.56\n\n    So we will use these 24 values for the forecast.\n\n    But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values. In this case, we don't have missing values in the historical data.\n\n    However, is this the best? We note that the prices on 2014/12/15 (Monday) were generally lower than the previous Tuesday? \n    But without more data, we cannot adjust for a trend.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? \n\n    Let me calculate the average for hour 0: \n        Tuesday (2014/12/9): 31.41\n        Wednesday (2014/12/10): 28.27\n        Thursday (2014/12/11): 28.71\n        Friday (2014/12/12): 29.38\n        Saturday (2014/12/13): 29.59\n        Sunday (2014/12/14): 30.42\n        Monday (2014/12/15): 27.31\n\n        Average = (31.41+28.27+28.71+29.38+29.59+30.42+27.31)/7 = 29.30\n\n    Then for hour 0 of 2014/12/16 (Tuesday) we would forecast 29.30.\n\n    But note: the average might smooth out the weekly pattern. The Tuesday value was 31.41, which is higher than the average.\n\n    Given that we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have a Tuesday in the history, it might be better to use the Tuesday pattern? \n\n    However, we only have one Tuesday. So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n    Therefore, I think the weekly naive (using the same day of the previous week) is a reasonable baseline.\n\n    But note: the problem says we are an expert. We might consider a more sophisticated model. However, without additional data (like multiple weeks) and without exogenous variables, and without a library, we are limited.\n\n    Considering the above, I will use the weekly naive method: use the same hour from the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago).\n\n    Forecast for 2014/12/16 0:00: 31.41\n    Forecast for 2014/12/16 1:00: 30.93\n    ... and so on.\n\n    We have 24 values.\n\n    However, let me write the exact values from 2014/12/9 0:00 to 2014/12/9 23:00:\n\n        0:00: 31.41\n        1:00: 30.93\n        2:00: 30.78\n        3:00: 30.77\n        4:00: 31.35\n        5:00: 31.79\n        6:00: 32.65\n        7:00: 38.55\n        8:00: 39.49\n        9:00: 36.48\n        10:00: 34.85\n        11:00: 33.89\n        12:00: 34.28\n        13:00: 34.57\n        14:00: 35.60\n        15:00: 34.42\n        16:00: 34.99\n        17:00: 34.02\n        18:00: 33.29\n        19:00: 32.11\n        20:00: 31.65\n        21:00: 31.16\n        22:00: 30.64\n        23:00: 29.56\n\n    So we will output these 24 values as the forecast for 2014/12/16 0:00 to 2014/12/16 23:00.\n\n    But note: the problem says we must handle missing values. In this case, we don't have any. So we are safe.\n\n    However, let me double-check: the historical data we are using (2014/12/9) is complete.\n\n    Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014/12/16 0:00 to 2014/12/16 23:00) is the same as the values from 2014/12/9 0:00 to 2014/12/9 23:00.\n\n    We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n    Format:\n        <answer>\n            2014/12/16 0:00 [forecast_value]\n            2014/12/16 1:00 [forecast_value]\n            ...\n            2014/12/16 23:00 [forecast_value]\n        </answer>\n\n    We must not skip any.\n\n    Let me write the forecast:\n\n        2014/12/16 0:00 31.41\n        2014/12/16 1:00 30.93\n        2014/12/16 2:00 30.78\n        2014/12/16 3:00 30.77\n        2014/12/16 4:00 31.35\n        2014/12/16 5:00 31.79\n        2014/12/16 6:00 32.65\n        2014/12/16 7:00 38.55\n        2014/12/16 8:00 39.49\n        2014/12/16 9:00 36.48\n        2014/12/16 10:00 34.85\n        2014/12/16 11:00 33.89\n        2014/12/16 12:00 34.28\n        2014/12/16 13:00 34.57\n        2014/12/16 14:00 35.60\n        2014/12/16 15:00 34.42\n        2014/12/16 16:00 34.99\n        2014/12/16 17:00 34.02\n        2014/12/16 18:00 33.29\n        2014/12/16 19:00 32.11\n        2014/12/16 20:00 31.65\n        2014/12/16 21:00 31.16\n        2014/12/16 22:00 30.64\n        2014/12/16 23:00 29.56\n\n    This is the forecast.\n\n    However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to be careful.
