        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-07-08 00:00 to 2014-07-14 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014-07-15 00:00 to 2014-07-15 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). However, we note that the data has a clear daily pattern and weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like load or wind forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n\n 3. Given the requirement for short-term forecasting (24 hours ahead) and the presence of daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly seasonality (168 hours), we can use a seasonal ARIMA model or exponential smoothing method. However, without the ability to run complex model fitting here, we will use a simpler approach that captures the daily pattern.\n\n 4. Approach:\n    a. We note that the data has a strong daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n    b. We can compute the average daily profile for the last 7 days and then adjust it by the overall level of the last day or two.\n\n 5. However, we also note that the data includes both weekdays and weekends. The last day in the data (2014-07-14) is a Monday. The next 24 hours are for Tuesday (2014-07-15). Therefore, we should look at the previous Tuesday (2014-07-08) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n 6. Steps for forecasting:\n    a. Extract the daily profiles for each of the 7 days.\n    b. Since the day to forecast is a Tuesday, we can look at the profile of the previous Tuesday (2014-07-08) and also the profile of the most recent days (Monday 2014-07-14) to adjust.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days (excluding weekends if necessary) to form the daily profile. But note: the data includes a weekend (12th and 13th are Saturday and Sunday). The 14th is Monday and 15th will be Tuesday.\n\n 8. We can compute the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the previous Tuesday? But note: the pattern on weekends is different.\n\n 9. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n    - The profile from the previous Tuesday (2014-07-08)\n    - The profile from the most recent weekday (Monday 2014-07-14) to adjust for the recent level.\n\n 10. We can also consider a simple method: take the average of the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same hour of the previous Tuesday? But note: Friday (2014-07-11) and Monday (2014-07-14) are both weekdays.\n\n 11. Proposed method:\n     We will compute the average daily profile for the last 3 weekdays: \n        Thursday (2014-07-10), Friday (2014-07-11), and Monday (2014-07-14) [Note: Saturday and Sunday are excluded because they have different patterns? But we are forecasting a Tuesday, which is a weekday. We don't have a Tuesday in the last 3 weekdays? We have Monday, then before that Friday?]\n\n 12. Alternatively, we can use the previous Tuesday (2014-07-08) and adjust by the ratio of the overall level of the last day (Monday 2014-07-14) to the level of the previous Monday (2014-07-07) but we don't have 2014-07-07.\n\n 13. Since we only have 7 days (from 8th to 14th), we can do:\n\n     Let's denote:\n        D0: Monday 2014-07-14\n        D-1: Sunday 2014-07-13\n        D-2: Saturday 2014-07-12\n        D-3: Friday 2014-07-11\n        D-4: Thursday 2014-07-10\n        D-5: Wednesday 2014-07-09\n        D-6: Tuesday 2014-07-08\n\n     We are forecasting Tuesday (2014-07-15). We can use the profile from D-6 (the last Tuesday) and adjust by the trend observed from D-6 to D0 (Monday). But note that from Tuesday to Monday there are 6 days, and the overall level might have changed.\n\n 14. We can compute the average of the last 3 weekdays (D0: Monday, D-3: Friday, D-4: Thursday) for each hour and then adjust by the ratio of the last day (Monday) to the average of the same weekday (Monday) in the previous week? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n 15. Since we don't have data before 2014-07-08, we must rely on the available 7 days.\n\n 16. We note that the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Monday) might have similar patterns, while weekends (Saturday, Sunday) are different.\n\n 17. We can compute the average profile for weekdays in the available data. The weekdays are:\n        Tuesday (2014-07-08) -> D-6\n        Wednesday (2014-07-09) -> D-5\n        Thursday (2014-07-10) -> D-4\n        Friday (2014-07-11) -> D-3\n        Monday (2014-07-14) -> D0\n\n     We have 5 weekdays. We can average the 5 weekdays for each hour (0 to 23) to form a typical weekday profile.\n\n 18. Then, we can adjust the typical profile by the level of the last day (Monday, D0). How? We can compute the ratio of the last Monday's average price to the average of the typical profile for Monday? But note: we don't isolated Monday in the typical profile? We have a single Monday.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the typical profile without adjustment? But the overall level might be changing.\n\n 20. We can compute the average of the last 24 hours (Monday) and the average of the typical profile for the same 24 hours (Monday is included in the typical profile as one of the weekdays). Then adjust the typical profile by the ratio: (last Monday's average) / (the average of the typical profile for the Monday hours? but we don't have multiple Mondays).\n\n 21. Instead, we can use the entire set of weekdays to form the profile and then adjust by the last day's overall level relative to the average of the entire set? \n\n     Let:\n        P(h): the average for hour h over the 5 weekdays.\n\n        Then, we compute the average of the entire Monday (D0) day: let M0 = average of the 24 hours of Monday.\n\n        And the average of the typical profile: M_avg = average of P(h) for h=0..23.\n\n        Then the adjusted profile for hour h: P'(h) = P(h) * (M0 / M_avg)\n\n 22. This adjustment scales the typical profile to match the level of the last day.\n\n 23. However, note that the last day (Monday) might have a different pattern? But we are using the entire day's average to adjust the level.\n\n 24. Steps:\n\n     a. Extract the 5 weekdays: \n          day1: 2014-07-08 (Tuesday) -> indices 0:23\n          day2: 2014-07-09 (Wednesday) -> indices 24:47\n          day3: 2014-07-10 (Thursday) -> indices 48:71\n          day4: 2014-07-11 (Friday) -> indices 72:95\n          day5: 2014-07-14 (Monday) -> indices 144:167\n\n     Note: The data starts at 2014-07-08 00:00 (index0) and ends at 2014-07-14 23:00 (index167). So:\n          Monday: 2014-07-14: from index 144 (2014-07-14 0:00) to 167 (2014-07-14 23:00)\n\n     b. For each hour of the day (0 to 23), compute the average over the 5 weekdays.\n\n        P(0) = (value at index0 + index24 + index48 + index72 + index144) / 5\n        P(1) = (index1 + index25 + index49 + index73 + index145) / 5\n        ... and so on.\n\n     c. Compute the average of the last Monday (indices 144 to 167): \n          M0 = (sum of values from index144 to 167) / 24\n\n     d. Compute the average of the typical profile P(h) for h=0..23: \n          M_avg = (sum_{h=0}^{23} P(h)) / 24\n\n     e. Then the forecast for hour h on 2014-07-15 (Tuesday) is:\n          forecast(h) = P(h) * (M0 / M_avg)\n\n 25. Why use the entire set of weekdays? Because we have only one Monday, but we want to capture the typical pattern. The adjustment by the level of the last day (Monday) accounts for the recent overall level.\n\n 26. However, note that the last day (Monday) is included in the typical profile. This might cause overfitting? But we are using it to adjust the level. Alternatively, we could exclude Monday from the typical profile and then adjust? \n\n     Let me recast:\n\n        Option 1: Use all 5 weekdays to form P(h). Then adjust by the last Monday's level.\n\n        Option 2: Form the typical profile using only the first 4 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and then adjust by the last Monday's level.\n\n     Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have a Tuesday in the first 4 weekdays, we can use Option 2 to avoid including the Monday in the base profile.\n\n 27. Let's do Option 2:\n\n        Form the typical profile P(h) using the first 4 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday): indices 0:95 (4 days * 24 = 96 points).\n\n        Then, we adjust by the level of the last Monday (which is the most recent day).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          a. For each hour h in 0..23:\n               P(h) = (value at [0+h, 24+h, 72+h]? Actually:\n                 Tuesday: h0: 0,1,...,23 -> indices 0 to 23\n                 Wednesday: indices 24 to 47\n                 Thursday: indices 48 to 71\n                 Friday: indices 72 to 95\n\n               So: P(h) = (data[0+h] + data[24+h] + data[48+h] + data[72+h]) / 4\n\n          b. M0 = average of Monday (indices 144 to 167) = (sum_{i=144}^{167} data[i]) / 24\n\n          c. M_avg = (sum_{h=0}^{23} P(h)) / 24\n\n          d. forecast(h) = P(h) * (M0 / M_avg)\n\n 28. This way, the typical profile is based on the previous weekdays (excluding Monday) and then adjusted to the level of the last Monday.\n\n 29. Why adjust by Monday? Because the Monday is the most recent day and reflects the current level. We assume that the level on Tuesday will be similar to Monday.\n\n 30. Let's compute:\n\n     First, we need the data in an array. The data is given as:\n\n        [26.21, 25.75, 25.36, ... , 27.27]  (168 values)\n\n     We index from 0 to 167.\n\n     Step a: Build P(h) for h=0 to 23.\n\n        h=0: \n            Tuesday (index0): 26.21\n            Wednesday (index24): 24.62   [because 24 hours after start: 24 is the first hour of Wednesday]\n            Thursday (index48): 25.08\n            Friday (index72): 25.98\n            P(0) = (26.21 + 24.62 + 25.08 + 25.98) / 4 = (101.89) / 4 = 25.4725\n\n        h=1:\n            Tuesday (index1): 25.75\n            Wednesday (index25): 23.69\n            Thursday (index49): 21.91\n            Friday (index73): 25.02\n            P(1) = (25.75+23.69+21.91+25.02)/4 = 96.37/4 = 24.0925\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n     Step b: Compute M0 (Monday average) for indices 144 to 167.\n\n        Monday: \n          144: 25.22\n          145: 23.05\n          146: 20.96\n          147: 19.74\n          148: 18.37\n          149: 23.94\n          150: 27.57\n

average them.\n\n        We'll compute P(h) for h=0 to 23:\n\n        h0: (26.21+24.62+25.08+25.98)/4 = 101.89/4 = 25.4725\n        h1: (25.75+23.69+21.91+25.02)/4 = 96.37/4 = 24.0925\n        h2:

Compute the 24 forecasts:\n\n        h0: 25.4725 * 1.0107 \u2248 25.75\n        h1: 24.0925 * 1.0107 \u2248 24.35\n        h2: 23.09 * 1.0107 \u2248 23.34\n        h3: 22.6625 * 1.0107 \u2248 22.91\n        h4: 23.3275 * 1.0107 \u2248 23.58\n        h5: 25.2425 * 1.0107 \u2248 25.52\n        h6: 26.8 * 1.0107 \u2248 27.09\n        h7: 28.145 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.45\n        h8: 29.0725 * 1.0107 \u2248 29.39\n        h9: 29.4275 * 1.0107 \u2248 29.75\n        h10: 29.6125 * 1.0107 \u2248 29.93\n        h11: 29.4575 * 1.0107 \u2248 29.78\n        h12: 29.2 * 1.0107 \u2248 29.52\n        h13: 28.8475 * 1.0107 \u2248 29.16\n        h14: 28.255 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.56\n        h15: 27.9075 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.21\n        h16: 27.7 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.00\n        h17: 28.1975 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.50\n        h18: 28.1325 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.43\n        h19: 28.1 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.40\n        h20: 27.79 * 1.0107 \u2248 28.09\n        h21: 27.405 * 1.0107 \u2248 27.70\n        h22: 27.3675 * 1.0107 \u2248 27.66\n        h23: 26.1625 * 1.0107 \u2248 26.45\n\n 32. But note: we are forecasting for 2014-07-15, which is the next day after 2014-07-14.\n\n 33. Format the forecast:\n\n        We output 24 values for the next 24 hours starting at 2014/7/15 0:00.\n\n        The output should be:\n\n          2014/7/15 0:00 <forecast0>\n          2014/7/15 1:00 <forecast1>\n          ... \n\n 34. We'll write the numbers rounded to two decimal places.\n\n 35. However, note that the adjustment factor is approximate. We used:\n\n        factor = 27.4354166667 / 27.1444791667 = 658.45/24 / (651.4675/24) = 658.45 / 651.4675 \u2248 1.0107\n\n     We'll use the exact factor: factor = 658.45 / 651.4675 \u2248 1.0107 (but we can use the exact ratio to avoid rounding error)\n\n        factor = 658.45 / 651.4675 = 1.0107 (we'll use this factor for all)\n\n 36. Let me recalculate the factor exactly:\n\n        factor = 658.45 / 651.4675 = 1.0107 (we'll use 1.0107 for multiplication)\n\n     But to be precise, we can do:\n\n        factor = 658.45 / 651.4675 = 65845 / 65146.75 -> but we'll use the decimal.\n\n     Actually, we can use:\n\n        factor = 658.45 / 651.4675 = 1.0107 (rounded to 4 decimals) is sufficient.\n\n 37. We'll compute each forecast as round(P(h)*factor, 2)\n\n 38. Let me recalculate with more precision:\n\n        factor = 658.45 / 651.4675 = 1.0107 (exactly: 658.45 \u00f7 651.4675 \u2248 1.0107)\n\n        We'll use 1.0107\n\n 39. Now, we do:\n\n        h0: 25.4725 * 1.0107 = 25.75 (exactly: 25.4725 * 1.0107 = 25.75 (rounded to 2 decimals? let me compute: 25.4725 * 1.0107 = 25.75 (exactly?))\n\n        Actually, 25.4725 * 1.0107 = 25.4725 * (1 + 0.0107) = 25.4725 + 25.4725*0.0107 = 25.4725 + 0.2726 = 25.7451 -> rounded to 25.75\n\n        h1: 24.0925 * 1.0107 = 24.0925 + 24.0925*0.0107 = 24.0925 + 0.2578 = 24.3503 -> 24.35\n\n        h2: 23.09 * 1.0107 = 23.09 + 23.09*0.0107 = 23.09 + 0.247 -> 23.337 -> 23.34\n\n        h3: 22.6625 * 1.0107 = 22.6625 + 22.6625*0.0107 = 22.6625 + 0.2425 = 22.905 -> 22.91\n\n        But let me do direct multiplication:\n\n        h0: 25.4725 * 1.0107 = 25.4725 * 1.0107 = \n          25.4725 * 1 = 25.4725\n          25.4725 * 0.0107 = 0.27256575\n          total = 25.74506575 -> 25.75\n\n        h1: 24.0925 * 1.0107 = 24.0925 * 1.0107 = \n          24.0925 * 1 = 24.0925\n          24.0925 * 0.0107 = 0.25778975\n          total = 24.35028975 -> 24.35\n\n        h2: 23.09 * 1.0107 = 23.09 * 1.0107 = \n          23.09 * 1 = 23.09\n          23.09 * 0.0107 = 0.247063\n          total = 23.337063 -> 23.34\n\n        h3: 22.6625 * 1.0107 = \n          22.6625 * 1 = 22.6625\n          22.6625 * 0.0107 = 0.24250875\n          total = 22.90500875 -> 22.91\n\n        h4: 23.3275 * 1.0107 = \n          23.3275 * 1 = 23.3275\n          23.3275 * 0.0107 = 0.24960425\n          total = 23.57710425 -> 23.58\n\n        h5: 25.2425 * 1.0107 = \n          25.2425 * 1 = 25.2425\n          25.2425 * 0.0107 = 0.27009475\n          total = 25.51259475 -> 25.51   (but wait, 25.51 or 25.52? 25.5126 rounds to 25.51? -> 25.51)\n\n          Correction: rounding 25.5126 to two decimals: look at the third decimal (2) which is less than 5 -> 25.51? \n          But 25.5126: the third decimal is 2, so we round down -> 25.51.\n\n          However, in the initial quick calculation I had 25.52. Let me check: 25.2425 * 1.0107 = 25.2425 * (1.01 + 0.0007) = 25.2425*1.01 = 25.494925, then 25.2425*0.0007=0.01766975 -> total 25.51259475 -> 25.51.\n\n        h6: 26.8 * 1.0107 = 26.8 * 1.0107 = \n          26.8 * 1 = 26.8\n          26.8 * 0.0107 = 0.28676\n          total = 27.08676 -> 27.09\n\n        h7: 28.145 * 1.0107 = \n          28.145 * 1 = 28.145\n          28.145 * 0.0107 = 0.3011515\n          total = 28.4461515 -> 28.45\n\n        h8: 29.0725 * 1.0107 = \n          29.0725 * 1 = 29.0725\n          29.0725 * 0.0107 = 0.31109575\n          total = 29.38359575 -> 29.38   (but wait, 29.38? but I had 29.39 earlier? 29.3836 rounds to 29.38)\n\n        However, let me compute: 29.0725 * 1.0107 = 29.0725 * (1+0.0107) = 29.0725 + 0.31109575 = 29.38359575 -> 29.38\n\n        But in the initial calculation I had 29.39. This is a rounding difference.\n\n        We must be consistent: we round to two decimals.\n\n        So we recalc all with the exact factor and round to two decimals.\n\n 40. Since the factor is 1.0107, we'll use that.\n\n 41. We'll compute each forecast value as:\n\n        value = round( P(h) * 1.0107, 2 )\n\n 42. Let me do the entire list:\n\n        h0: 25.4725 * 1.0107 = 25.74506575 -> 25.75\n        h1: 24.0925 * 1.0107 = 24.35028975 -> 24.35\n        h2: 23.09 * 1.0107 = 23.337063 -> 23.34\n        h3: 22.6625 * 1.0107 = 22.90500875 -> 22.91\n        h4: 23.3275 * 1.0107 = 23.57710425 -> 23.58\n        h5: 25.2425 * 1.0107 = 25.51259475 -> 25.51\n        h6: 26.8 * 1.0107 = 27.08676 -> 27.09\n        h7: 28.145 * 1.0107 = 28.4461515 -> 28.45\n        h8: 29.0725 * 1.0107 = 29.38359575 -> 29.38\n        h9: 29.4275 * 1.0107 = 29.74927425 -> 29.75\n        h10: 29.6125 * 1.0107 = 29.92907375 -> 29.93\n        h11: 29.4575 * 1.0107 = 29.77719525 -> 29.78\n        h12: 29.2 * 1.0107 = 29.51244 -> 29.51\n        h13: 28.8475 * 1.0107 = 29.15724825 -> 29.16\n        h14: 28.255 * 1.0107 = 28.5573285 -> 28.56\n        h15: 27.9075 * 1.0107 = 28.21031025 -> 28.21\n        h16: 27.7 * 1.0107 = 27.99339 -> 27.99\n        h17: 28.1975 * 1.0107 = 28.50119325 -> 28.50\n        h18: 28.1325 * 1.0107 = 28.43351775 -> 28.43\n        h19: 28.1 * 1.0107 = 28.4007 -> 28.40\n        h20: 27.79 * 1.0107 = 28.087353 -> 28.09\n        h21: 27.405 * 1.0107 = 27.7042335 -> 27.70\n        h22: 27.3675 * 1.0107 = 27.66153225 -> 27.66\n        h23: 26.1625 * 1.0107 = 26.44438875 -> 26.44\n\n 43. So the forecast for 2014-07-15:\n\n        0:00: 25.75\n        1:00: 24.35\n        2:00: 23.34\n        3:00: 22.91\n        4:00: 23.58\n        5:00: 25.51\n        6:00: 27.09\n        7:00: 28.45\n        8:00: 29.38\n        9:00: 29.75\n        10:00: 29.93\n        11:00: 29.78\n        12:00: 29.51\n        13:00: 29.16\n        14:00: 28.56\n        15:00: 28.21\n        16:00: 27.99\n        17:00: 28.50\n        18:00: 28.43\n        19:00: 28.40\n        20:00: 28.09\n        21:00: 27.70\n        22:00: 27.66\n        23:00: 26.44\n\n 44. We output in the same format as the input, but for the next day.\n\n 45. Note: The dates are in the format \"YYYY/M/D H:MM\", so for 2014-07-15:\n\n        \"2014/7/15 0:00\"\n        \"2014/7/15 1:00\"\n        ... \n\n 46. We write the answer in the required format.\n\n 47. However, note: the historical data had two-digit hour? The example: \"2014/7/8 0:00\", so we use the same.\n\n 48. Final output:\n\n        <answer>\n2014/7/15 0:00 25.75\n2014/7/15 1:00 24.35\n2014/7/15 2:00 23.34\n2014/7/15 3:00 22.91\n2014/7/15 4:00 23.58\n2014/7/15 5:00 25.51\n2014/7/15 6:00 27.09\n2014/7/15 7:00 28.45\n2014/7/15 8:00 29.38\n2014/7/15 9:00 29.75\n2014/7/15 10:00 29.93\n2014/7/15 11:00 29.78\n2014/7/15 12:00 29.51\n2014/7/15 13:00 29.16\n2014/7/15 14:00 28.56\n2014/7/15 15:00 28.21\n2014/7/15 16:00 27.99\n2014/7/15 17:00 28.50\n2014/7/15 18:00 28.43\n2014/7/15 19:00 28.40\n2014/7/15 20:00 28.09\n2014/7/15 21:00 27.70\n2014/7/15 22:00 27.66\n2014/7/15 23:00 26.44\n        </answer>\n\n 49. But wait: the date format in the input had a space and then the hour without leading zero? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2014/7/8 0:00\"\n\n     So we use the same: \"2014/7/15 0:00\", etc.\n\n 50. We note that the month and day are without leading zeros.\n\n 51. This is the forecast.\n\n 52. We did not use any complex model, but a simple average profile adjusted by the last day's level. This is a common practice in electricity price forecasting for short-term when only historical prices are available.\n\n 53. We assume that the pattern of weekdays is similar and the level of the last day (Monday) is a good indicator for the next day (Tuesday).\n\n 54. We did not consider any trend beyond the last day, but the adjustment by the last day's level should account for recent changes.\n\n 55. We output the 24 values as required.\n",
