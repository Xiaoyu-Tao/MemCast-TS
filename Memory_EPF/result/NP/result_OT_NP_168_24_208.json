        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-12-27 00:00 to 2017-01-02 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2017-01-03 00:00 to 2017-01-03 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also includes grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the historical observed prices (OT). Since we don't have the other features, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can use a time series forecasting method that can handle univariate series. Since the data has clear daily seasonality (24-hour pattern) and we are forecasting 24 hours ahead, we can use a seasonal model.\n\nApproach:\n1. Check for missing values: The provided data does not have any missing values in the given period. So we can proceed without imputation.\n2. We note that the data has a frequency of 1 hour and exhibits daily seasonality (period=24).\n3. We can use a model that captures seasonality and trends. Given the short-term forecast horizon (24 hours), we can use a simple seasonal decomposition or a seasonal naive approach. However, we can also use more sophisticated models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing (ETS) with seasonality.\n\nBut note: We are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables. So we are limited to univariate methods.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the fact that we are to provide a forecast without a complex model training, we can use a simple but effective method: Seasonal Naive. In the seasonal naive method, the forecast for each hour in the next day is the observed value from the same hour in the previous day (or same period in the seasonal cycle). Since we have a weekly pattern? But note: the data we have is only 7 days (168 hours). However, the last day (2017-01-02) is a Monday. The next day (2017-01-03) is a Tuesday. We can look at the same day of the previous week? But note: the previous Tuesday was 2016-12-27.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the last available same hour of the day. However, the data shows that the pattern might be changing. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that might smooth too much.\n\nGiven the data, we see that the prices on 2017-01-02 (Monday) are higher than the previous Monday (2016-12-26 is not provided, but we have from 2016-12-27 which is Tuesday). So we have:\n\n- 2016-12-27 (Tuesday): first day\n- 2016-12-28 (Wednesday)\n- 2016-12-29 (Thursday)\n- 2016-12-30 (Friday)\n- 2016-12-31 (Saturday)\n- 2017-01-01 (Sunday)\n- 2017-01-02 (Monday)\n\nWe are to forecast 2017-01-03 (Tuesday). So we can use the same day of the previous week (2016-12-27) as a naive forecast? But note that the market conditions might have changed. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last week (7 days) to account for the weekly pattern.\n\nHowever, let's look at the data: \nThe price on 2016-12-27 (Tuesday) and 2017-01-02 (Monday) are different. Also, the next day to forecast is a Tuesday. We have one Tuesday in the data: 2016-12-27.\n\nBut we also have the last 24 hours (2017-01-02) which is a Monday, and the day before (2017-01-01 Sunday) and so on. \n\nGiven the short history and the fact that we are forecasting only one day ahead, we can use a model that uses the daily pattern and the recent trend.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a moving average model with seasonality. But without more data, we can try:\n\nMethod: We will use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which includes Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday of the previous week? but we don't have the same day of the week for Tuesday). Actually, we have:\n\nFor the hour 00:00 on 2017-01-03 (Tuesday), we can take the average of:\n  00:00 on 2017-01-02 (Monday): 29.42\n  00:00 on 2017-01-01 (Sunday): 25.70\n  00:00 on 2016-12-31 (Saturday): 25.11\n  00:00 on 2016-12-30 (Friday): 28.18\n  00:00 on 2016-12-29 (Thursday): 29.26\n  00:00 on 2016-12-28 (Wednesday): 26.45\n  00:00 on 2016-12-27 (Tuesday): 24.08\n\nBut that would be 7 days. However, we don't know if the pattern is weekly. Alternatively, we can use the last 3 days (which includes Sunday, Monday, and the Saturday?).\n\nBut note: the day of the week effect: Tuesday might be similar to the previous Tuesday? But we only have one Tuesday. So we can use:\n\nOption 1: Use the same hour from the previous day (Monday 2017-01-02) for each hour? That would be a one-day lag.\n\nOption 2: Use the same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2016-12-27) for each hour.\n\nBut we can also that the prices have been increasing in the last few days. So we can take a weighted average? \n\nGiven the simplicity and the fact that we don't have a model trained, I propose:\n\nWe use the average of the same hour from the last two days (Monday and Sunday) and the same day of the previous week (Tuesday). \n\nBut we have to be cautious: the last two days are Sunday and Monday, and the previous Tuesday is 7 days before. \n\nAlternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing for the seasonal indices? \n\nBut to keep it simple and given the instructions, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for forecasting the next day (Tuesday). Why 3? Because it's a common short-term memory and we don't have a strong weekly pattern with only one week.\n\nSo for hour 00:00, we take:\n  Saturday (2016-12-31 00:00): 25.11\n  Sunday (2017-01-01 00:00): 25.70\n  Monday (2017-01-02 00:00): 29.42\n  Average = (25.11 + 25.70 + 29.42) / 3 = 26.74333\n\nBut we note that the price on Monday was higher. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average with more weight on the most recent day. For example, weights: 0.5 for Monday, 0.3 for Sunday, 0.2 for Saturday.\n\nThen for 00:00: 0.5*29.42 + 0.3*25.70 + 0.2*25.11 = 14.71 + 7.71 + 5.022 = 27.442\n\nBut without a clear reason for the weights, we can stick to the simple average.\n\nHowever, let me check the pattern for the same hour (00:00) over the week:\n\n2016-12-27 00:00: 24.08 (Tuesday)\n2016-12-28 00:00: 26.45 (Wednesday)\n2016-12-29 00:00: 29.26 (Thursday)\n2016-12-30 00:00: 28.18 (Friday)\n2016-12-31 00:00: 25.11 (Saturday)\n2017-01-01 00:00: 25.70 (Sunday)\n2017-01-02 00:00: 29.42 (Monday)\n\nWe see that the 00:00 price on Tuesday (24.08) is lower than the following days. But the Tuesday we are forecasting is after a Monday that was 29.42. So we might expect a drop? But without more Tuesdays, it's hard.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will use the average of the last 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for each hour. This is a moving average of the same hour over the last 3 days.\n\nSo for each hour h (0 to 23) on 2017-01-03, we compute:\n   forecast_h = (value of h on 2016-12-31 + value of h on 2017-01-01 + value of h on 2017-01-02) / 3\n\nBut note: 2016-12-31 is Saturday, 2017-01-01 is Sunday, 2017-01-02 is Monday.\n\nLet's do the calculation:\n\nHour 0: (25.11 + 25.70 + 29.42) / 3 = 80.23 / 3 = 26.7433 -> 26.74\nHour 1: (23.65 + 25.61 + 28.95) / 3 = 78.21 / 3 = 26.07\nHour 2: (22.99 + 25.49 + 28.22) / 3 = 76.70 / 3 = 25.5667 -> 25.57\nHour 3: (22.13 + 25.25 + 28.22) / 3 = 75.60 / 3 = 25.20\nHour 4: (22.57 + 25.63 + 28.92) / 3 = 77.12 / 3 = 25.7067 -> 25.71\nHour 5: (23.47 + 25.88 + 30.47) / 3 = 79.82 / 3 = 26.6067 -> 26.61\nHour 6: (25.03 + 26.58 + 32.09) / 3 = 83.70 / 3 = 27.90\nHour 7: (25.78 + 26.64 + 33.07) / 3 = 85.49 / 3 = 28.4967 -> 28.50\nHour 8: (26.82 + 26.70 + 33.92) / 3 = 87.44 / 3 = 29.1467 -> 29.15\nHour 9: (27.89 + 26.89 + 34.38) / 3 = 89.16 / 3 = 29.72\nHour 10: (28.36 + 27.80 + 34.17) / 3 = 90.33 / 3 = 30.11\nHour 11: (28.47 + 28.10 + 34.05) / 3 = 90.62 / 3 = 30.2067 -> 30.21\nHour 12: (28.43 + 28.36 + 33.64) / 3 = 90.43 / 3 = 30.1433 -> 30.14\nHour 13: (28.30 + 28.71 + 33.59) / 3 = 90.60 / 3 = 30.20\nHour 14: (28.52 + 29.65 + 33.81) / 3 = 91.98 / 3 = 30.66\nHour 15: (29.11 + 30.38 + 34.49) / 3 = 93.98 / 3 = 31.3267 -> 31.33\nHour 16: (29.50 + 30.77 + 35.16) / 3 = 95.43 / 3 = 31.81\nHour 17: (29.57 + 30.92 + 35.80) / 3 = 96.29 / 3 = 32.0967 -> 32.10\nHour 18: (29.24 + 30.77 + 34.83) / 3 = 94.84 / 3 = 31.6133 -> 31.61\nHour 19: (28.38 + 30.50 + 33.93) / 3 = 92.81 / 3 = 30.9367 -> 30.94\nHour 20: (27.98 + 30.19 + 33.42) / 3 = 91.59 / 3 = 30.53\nHour 21: (27.52 + 29.94 + 33.09) / 3 = 90.55 / 3 = 30.1833 -> 30.18\nHour 22: (26.80 + 29.65 + 32.12) / 3 = 88.57 / 3 = 29.5233 -> 29.52\nHour 23: (26.71 + 29.36 + 30.93) / 3 = 87.00 / 3 = 29.00\n\nBut note: the last day (2017-01-02) had a significant increase. So the average might be pulled up. Alternatively, we could use only the last two days? But the problem says to handle missing values, but we don't have missing values.\n\nHowever, to be more accurate, we might consider that the price on 2017-01-02 (Monday) was a working day and the next day is also a working day, while Saturday and Sunday are weekends. So we might want to use only the last two days? But then we have only two days. Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) and the last two days? But that would be 3 days: Tuesday (2016-12-27), Sunday (2017-01-01), Monday (2017-01-02). But the Tuesday was 7 days ago and the pattern might have changed.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are not provided with exogenous data, I will stick to the 3-day moving average of the same hour for the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated method? However, without the ability to run complex models (like SARIMA) in this environment and without the other features, we have to use a simple method.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a naive seasonal method with seasonality of 24 hours, but using the last available same hour? That would be the value from 24 hours ago. For example, for 2017-01-03 00:00, we use 2017-01-02 00:00 (29.42). But that would ignore the day of the week.\n\nBut the data shows that the price at 00:00 on Monday (29.42) is higher than the previous days. If we use that for Tuesday, it might be too high.\n\nGiven the trade-offs, I choose the 3-day moving average (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for the same hour.\n\nSo the forecast for 2017-01-03 from 00:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n00:00: 26.74\n01:00: 26.07\n02:00: 25.57\n03:00: 25.20\n04:00: 25.71\n05:00: 26.61\n06:00: 27.90\n07:00: 28.50\n08:00: 29.15\n09:00: 29.72\n10:00: 30.11\n11:00: 30.21\n12:00: 30.14\n13:00: 30.20\n14:00: 30.66\n15:00: 31.33\n16:00: 31.81\n17:00: 32.10\n18:00: 31.61\n19:00: 30.94\n20:00: 30.53\n21:00: 30.18\n22:00: 29.52\n23:00: 29.00\n\nBut note that the prices on 2017-01-02 were generally higher than the weekend. So the average might be a compromise.\n\nWe output the forecast in the required format.\n\nNote: The dates for the forecast are 2017/1/3 0:00 to 2017/1/3 23:00.\n\nLet's write the forecast in the same style as the input.\n",
