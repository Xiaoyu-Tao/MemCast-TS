        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2017-02-14 00:00 to 2017-02-20 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2017-02-21 00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 consecutive hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power), we can only use a univariate time series model.\n 3. We note that electricity prices have daily (24-hour) seasonality and weekly patterns. However, the data provided is only one week (7 days). \n 4. Given the short history, we can use a simple model that captures:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 periods)\n    - Trend (if any) and recent changes.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a seasonal naive method, which uses the value from the same hour of the previous day. However, note that the pattern might change from weekday to weekend.\n\n But note the dates:\n  2017-02-14 (Tuesday) to 2017-02-20 (Monday). \n  We are forecasting 2017-02-21 (Tuesday). \n\n Since 2017-02-14 was a Tuesday, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2017-02-14) as a naive forecast for 2017-02-21? \n However, note that the next day (2017-02-21) is also a Tuesday. So we can use the previous Tuesday (2017-02-14) as a reference.\n\n But we have more recent data? We can also consider the average of the same hour of the last few days? \n\n However, the data shows:\n   - Weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon) and weekend (Sat, Sun) have different behaviors.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2017-02-14) and also the Monday (2017-02-20) to capture the recent trend.\n\n But note: the price on 2017-02-20 (Monday) was lower than the previous Tuesday? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour of the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n Given the constraints, a simple approach is to use the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2017-02-20) as a base and adjust for the weekly pattern by comparing the previous Tuesday (2017-02-14) and the Monday of that week (2017-02-13 is not available) so we don't have a full week of the previous week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays? But we only have one week of data.\n\n Considering the above, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Use the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2017-02-20) and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday (2017-02-14) and the Monday of that week? But we don't have 2017-02-13.\n\n Option 2: Use the same hour from the previous week (2017-02-14) and adjust by the trend of the last 7 days? \n\n However, the data from 2017-02-14 to 2017-02-20 shows a general decline? \n\n Let me compute the average price per day:\n\n  2017-02-14: average = (30.02+29.68+...+31.96)/24 -> let's compute roughly: \n      We see values from 29.68 to 38.73 -> average around 33.5? (exact calculation not needed, but we can note the daily average trend)\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a model that uses the last week and the last day? \n\n  We can try: \n      Forecast = (Last week same hour + Last day same hour) / 2\n\n  But note: \n      Last week same hour: from 2017-02-14 (Tuesday) \n      Last day same hour: from 2017-02-20 (Monday)\n\n  However, the day of the week is different? We are forecasting Tuesday, and we are using a Monday and a Tuesday? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous week (2017-02-14) and then adjust by the change from the previous Monday (2017-02-13) to the current Monday (2017-02-20)? But we don't have 2017-02-13.\n\n Given the data limitations, I propose:\n\n  Since we have only one week of data and the next day is a Tuesday, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2017-02-14) as the forecast, but then adjust by the overall trend of the week.\n\n  How to adjust? We can compute the average price of the last 7 days and the average price of the 7 days before that? But we don't have the week before.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last 24 hours to capture the recent level and then add the daily pattern from the previous Tuesday? \n\n  Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, I will use:\n\n      Forecast for hour h (0-23) on 2017-02-21 = \n          (Value from 2017-02-14 at hour h) * (Average of last 24 hours) / (Average of 2017-02-14)\n\n  This adjusts the level of the previous Tuesday by the current level of the last day.\n\n  Steps:\n      Let A = average of the last 24 hours (2017-02-20 00:00 to 2017-02-20 23:00)\n      Let B = average of 2017-02-14 (00:00 to 23:00)\n\n      Then for hour h (0 to 23) on 2017-02-21:\n          forecast_h = (value of 2017-02-14 at hour h) * (A / B)\n\n  Why? We assume the shape of the day is similar to the previous Tuesday, but the overall level is adjusted to the current level (as represented by the last day).\n\n  However, note: the last day (2017-02-20) is a Monday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday. But we don't have a Monday from the previous week to compare.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the entire week to compute the level? \n\n  Let me compute the averages:\n\n      Day 1 (2017-02-14, Tuesday): \n          values: [30.02, 29.68, ... , 31.96] -> average_B = (sum of 24 values)/24\n      Last 24 hours (2017-02-20, Monday): \n          values: [26.95, 26.30, ... , 27.66] -> average_A = (sum of 24 values)/24\n\n  Then the ratio = average_A / average_B\n\n  But note: the previous Tuesday (2017-02-14) had a higher average than the last Monday (2017-02-20). So we are scaling down the previous Tuesday pattern by the ratio.\n\n  However, we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we are using a Tuesday pattern from a week ago, but scaled to the level of the most recent day (Monday). This might not be ideal because Tuesday and Monday are different.\n\n  Another idea: use the same hour from the previous week (Tuesday) and the same hour from the previous week (Monday) to adjust? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week.\n\n  Given the data, I think the above method is a reasonable simple approach.\n\n  Let's compute:\n\n      Average of 2017-02-14 (B):\n          We'll calculate: \n          30.02+29.68+29.86+29.90+30.09+31.40+32.84+34.63+37.18+35.34+33.96+33.36+33.15+33.36+33.36+33.37+34.50+38.73+38.51+35.71+33.53+33.38+32.87+31.96\n          = 30.02+29.68=59.7, +29.86=89.56, +29.90=119.46, +30.09=149.55, +31.40=180.95, +32.84=213.79, +34.63=248.42, +37.18=285.6, +35.34=320.94, +33.96=354.9, +33.36=388.26, +33.15=421.41, +33.36=454.77, +33.36=488.13, +33.37=521.5, +34.50=556.0, +38.73=594.73, +38.51=633.24, +35.71=668.95, +33.53=702.48, +33.38=735.86, +32.87=768.73, +31.96=800.69\n          Average_B = 800.69 / 24 = 33.36208333\n\n      Average of 2017-02-20 (A):\n          26.95+26.30+25.98+26.10+27.18+29.03+30.53+31.18+31.51+31.42+31.28+30.95+30.87+30.91+30.98+30.88+31.08+31.50+31.54+30.98+30.51+30.03+29.36+27.66\n          = 26.95+26.30=53.25, +25.98=79.23, +26.10=105.33, +27.18=132.51, +29.03=161.54, +30.53=192.07, +31.18=223.25, +31.51=254.76, +31.42=286.18, +31.28=317.46, +30.95=348.41, +30.87=379.28, +30.91=410.19, +30.98=441.17, +30.88=472.05, +31.08=503.13, +31.50=534.63, +31.54=566.17, +30.98=597.15, +30.51=627.66, +30.03=657.69, +29.36=687.05, +27.66=714.71\n          Average_A = 714.71 / 24 = 29.77958333\n\n      Ratio = A / B = 29.77958333 / 33.36208333 \u2248 0.8926\n\n  Then for each hour h (0 to 23) on 2017-02-21, we take the value from 2017-02-14 at hour h and multiply by 0.8926.\n\n  Example for hour 0: \n      2017-02-14 0:00: 30.02 -> forecast = 30.02 * 0.8926 \u2248 26.79\n\n  But note: the last day (Monday) had a lower average than the previous Tuesday. So we are scaling down.\n\n  However, we must consider that the day of the week effect might be different. But without more data, this is a simple approach.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But we have only 7 days, and the days are different types (weekdays and weekend). \n\n  We can try: for each hour h, we take the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would include Saturday and Sunday, which are different.\n\n  Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday and the same hour from the previous Monday (to capture the transition from Monday to Tuesday)? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n  Given the data, I will use the scaling method above.\n\n  Let's compute the 24 forecasted values:\n\n      Hour 0: 30.02 * 0.8926 = 26.79\n      Hour 1: 29.68 * 0.8926 = 26.49\n      Hour 2: 29.86 * 0.8926 = 26.65\n      Hour 3: 29.90 * 0.8926 = 26.69\n      Hour 4: 30.09 * 0.8926 = 26.86\n      Hour 5: 31.40 * 0.8926 = 28.02\n      Hour 6: 32.84 * 0.8926 = 29.31\n      Hour 7: 34.63 * 0.8926 = 30.91\n      Hour 8: 37.18 * 0.8926 = 33.18\n      Hour 9: 35.34 * 0.8926 = 31.54\n      Hour 10: 33.96 * 0.8926 = 30.31\n      Hour 11: 33.36 * 0.8926 = 29.77\n      Hour 12: 33.15 * 0.8926 = 29.59\n      Hour 13: 33.36 * 0.8926 = 29.77\n      Hour 14: 33.36 * 0.8926 = 29.77\n      Hour 15: 33.37 * 0.8926 = 29.78\n      Hour 16: 34.50 * 0.8926 = 30.79\n      Hour 17: 38.73 * 0.8926 = 34.57\n      Hour 18: 38.51 * 0.8926 = 34.37\n      Hour 19: 35.71 * 0.8926 = 31.87\n      Hour 20: 33.53 * 0.8926 = 29.93\n      Hour 21: 33.38 * 0.8926 = 29.79\n      Hour 22: 32.87 * 0.8926 = 29.34\n      Hour 23: 31.96 * 0.8926 = 28.53\n\n  But note: the last day (Monday) had a dip in the night and then a peak in the morning? Our forecast for Tuesday is scaled from the previous Tuesday, which had a different pattern? \n\n  However, without more data, this is a straightforward method.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the last week's Tuesday as a template and adjust by the difference between the last two days? \n\n  But let's stick to the above.\n\n  We'll output the forecast for 2017-02-21 00:00 to 2017-02-21 23:00.\n\n  Format:\n\n      2017/2/21 0:00 <value>\n      2017/2/21 1:00 <value>\n      ... \n\n  We'll round to two decimal places.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"Observed Nord Pool electricity price (\u20ac/MWh, 1-hour resolution)\" and the historical data has two decimals.\n\n  Let me recalculate the ratio more accurately:\n\n      B = 800.69 / 24 = 33.36208333333333\n      A = 714.71 / 24 = 29.779583333333333\n      ratio = 29.779583333333333 / 33.36208333333333 = 0.892625\n\n  Then we multiply each value by 0.892625 and round to two decimals.\n\n  Let me recalculate the first few:\n\n      Hour0: 30.02 * 0.892625 = 30.02 * 0.892625 = 26.794 (rounded to 26.79)\n      Hour1: 29.68 * 0.892625 = 29.495 (rounded to 29.50) -> but wait, let me compute: 29.68 * 0.892625 = 26.495? \n\n  Actually, 29.68 * 0.892625 = \n      29.68 * 0.892625 = \n        29.68 * 0.89 = 26.4152\n        29.68 * 0.002625 = 0.07791\n        total = 26.49311 -> 26.49\n\n  So we do:\n\n      Hour0: 30.02 * 0.892625 = 26.794 -> 26.79\n      Hour1: 29.68 * 0.892625 = 26.493 -> 26.49\n      Hour2: 29.86 * 0.892625 = 26.655 -> 26.66\n      Hour3: 29.90 * 0.892625 = 26.690 -> 26.69\n        29.90 * 0.892625 = 26.690 (exactly) -> 26.69\n      Hour4: 30.09 * 0.892625 = 26.861 -> 26.86\n\n  We'll do this for all.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write a small program, but since we are doing by hand, we'll do the 24.\n\n  Let me do the calculations:\n\n      h0: 30.02 * 0.892625 = 26.794 -> 26.79\n      h1: 29.68 * 0.892625 = 26.493 -> 26.49\n      h2: 29.86 * 0.892625 = 26.655 -> 26.66\n      because: 29.86 * 0.892625 = \n          29.86 * 0.89 = 26.5754\n          29.86 * 0.002625 = 0.0783825\n          total = 26.6537825 -> 26.65 -> but rounding to two decimals: 26.65? \n          Actually, 26.6537825 -> 26.65 (since 3<5, so 26.65)\n\n      However, let me use a more precise method:\n\n          h0: 30.02 * 0.892625 = 30.02 * (0.892625) = \n              30.02 * 0.892625 = \n                30.02 * 0.8 = 24.016\n                30.02 * 0.09 = 2.7018\n                30.02 * 0.002 = 0.06004\n                30.02 * 0.0006 = 0.018012\n                30.02 * 0.000025 = 0.0007505\n                total = 24.016+2.7018=26.7178 +0.06004=26.77784 +0.018012=26.795852 +0.0007505=26.7966 -> 26.80? \n          This is inconsistent.\n\n  To avoid confusion, we can use:\n\n      value = round(price_20170214_h * (29.779583333333333 / 33.36208333333333), 2)\n\n  We'll use a calculator for each:\n\n      h0: 30.02 * (29.779583333333333 / 33.36208333333333) = 30.02 * 0.892625 = 26.794 (if we use 0.892625, then 30.02*0.892625=26.794 -> 26.79)\n\n  But note: 29.779583333333333 / 33.36208333333333 = 0.892625 exactly? \n\n  Let me compute: \n      29.779583333333333 / 33.36208333333333 = 0.892625 (exactly, because 29.779583333333333 = 714.71/24, 33.36208333333333=800.69/24, so ratio = 714.71/800.69 = 0.892625)\n\n  So we can use 0.892625.\n\n  We'll compute:\n\n      h0: 30.02 * 0.892625 = 26.794 -> 26.79\n      h1: 29.68 * 0.892625 = 26.493 -> 26.49\n      h2: 29.86 * 0.892625 = 26.655 -> 26.66 (because 26.655 rounded to 26.66? but 26.655 is exactly halfway? rounding rule: round to nearest even? \n          However, in finance, we usually round to two decimals by rounding 5 up? \n          Let me check: 26.655 -> 26.66? because  Actually, 26.655: the third decimal is 5, so we round up the second decimal from 5 to 6? -> 26.66.\n\n      But note: the historical data has two decimals, so we should output two decimals.\n\n  We'll round to two decimals using standard rounding (round half up).\n\n  We can do:\n\n      h0: 26.79\n      h1: 26.49\n      h2: 26.66\n      h3: 29.90 * 0.892625 = 26.690 -> 26.69\n      h4: 30.09 * 0.892625 = 26.861 -> 26.86\n      h5: 31.40 * 0.892625 = 28.022 -> 28.02\n      h6: 32.84 * 0.892625 = 29.312 -> 29.31\n      h7: 34.63 * 0.892625 = 30.911 -> 30.91\n      h8: 37.18 * 0.892625 = 33.188 -> 33.19 (because 33.188 -> 33.19?
