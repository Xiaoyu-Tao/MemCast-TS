        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-11-08 00:00 to 2016-11-14 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-11-15 00:00 to 2016-11-15 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and the datetime. Since the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the price (OT) and date, we must rely on time series forecasting using only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Given the hourly data and the need for a 24-hour forecast, we can use a model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - Weekly seasonality (168 hours) might be considered, but we have only one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days (168 hours) and we are forecasting the next day (24 hours).\n\n However, note that the data provided is from 2016-11-08 (Tuesday) to 2016-11-14 (Monday). The next day is 2016-11-15 (Tuesday).\n\n We can observe that weekdays (Monday to Friday) have similar patterns (higher during the day, especially in the morning and evening peaks) and weekends (Saturday and Sunday) have lower and flatter patterns.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday (2016-11-15), we can look at the previous Tuesday (2016-11-08) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n But note: the data from 2016-11-08 (Tuesday) to 2016-11-14 (Monday) includes:\n   - 2016-11-08: Tuesday\n   - 2016-11-09: Wednesday\n   - 2016-11-10: Thursday\n   - 2016-11-11: Friday\n   - 2016-11-12: Saturday\n   - 2016-11-13: Sunday\n   - 2016-11-14: Monday\n\n We are forecasting 2016-11-15: Tuesday.\n\n How to forecast?\n Since we don't have exogenous variables (like load and wind) and only have the historical prices, we can use a simple method that captures the daily pattern and the recent trend.\n\n Idea:\n 1. Compute the average daily profile for weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and for weekends (Saturday and Sunday). But note: Monday and Tuesday are weekdays, but we have only one Tuesday and one Monday in the data.\n\n However, we have only one week of data. So we can use:\n   - The previous Tuesday (2016-11-08) as a base.\n   - Adjust it by the trend from the last day (Monday, 2016-11-14) relative to the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday. The data starts on Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we can try:\n\n Method 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., the Tuesday of the previous week) and adjust by the overall trend of the last 24 hours.\n\n But note: the last day (Monday, 2016-11-14) and the Monday of the previous week is not available (since our data starts on Tuesday). So we don't have a full week of data for Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days for each hour? But we have only 7 days, so we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the available 7 days? However, the pattern on weekends is different.\n\n We can break the week:\n   - Weekdays: Tuesday (2016-11-08), Wednesday (2016-11-09), Thursday (2016-11-10), Friday (2016-11-11), Monday (2016-11-14) -> 5 days\n   - Weekends: Saturday (2016-11-12), Sunday (2016-11-13) -> 2 days\n\n For the forecast (Tuesday) we can use the average of the weekdays for each hour? But note: the last Monday (2016-11-14) is included.\n\n However, we can also consider that the Tuesday we are forecasting is after a Monday, so we can use the average of the previous weekdays that are the same day of the week? But we have one Tuesday (2016-11-08) and then the other weekdays.\n\n Since we have only one Tuesday, we can use that as a base and adjust by the change in the overall level.\n\n How to adjust?\n We can compute the average price of the last 24 hours (Monday, 2016-11-14) and compare it to the average price of the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the average of the entire week and then the average of the base Tuesday, and then adjust the base Tuesday by the ratio of the last 24 hours average to the base Tuesday average? \n\n However, a simpler method is to use the last week's Tuesday (2016-11-08) and then adjust by the difference between the last day (Monday) and the same day a week ago? But we don't have the Monday a week ago.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last 3 weekdays (Friday, Monday) and the Tuesday of last week? But that might not be consistent.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we don't have a full two weeks, we can use:\n\n   Forecast for hour h (0-23) on 2016-11-15 = \n        (Price of hour h on 2016-11-08) * (Average price of last 24 hours) / (Average price of 2016-11-08)\n\n But note: 2016-11-08 was a Tuesday and we are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n Steps:\n   Let base_day = 2016-11-08 (Tuesday)\n   Let base_day_avg = average of the 24 hours of base_day.\n\n   Let last_day = 2016-11-14 (Monday) -> but note: we are comparing Tuesday to Monday? They are different days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire last week (7 days) and the average of the base week? But we don't have the base week (we have only one week).\n\n Since we have only one week, we can compute the average of the entire week (168 hours) and then the average of the last 24 hours (Monday) and then adjust the base Tuesday by the ratio: (last 24 hours average) / (average of the entire week) *But note: the entire week includes weekends which are lower, so the Monday average might be higher than the weekly average?*\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days for the same hour? But we have only 7 days, so for each hour we have 7 observations.\n\n We can do:\n\n   For hour h (0 to 23):\n        forecast_h = (1/5) * [ (price of h on Tuesday) + (price of h on Wednesday) + (price of h on Thursday) + (price of h on Friday) + (price of h on Monday) ]\n\n Why 5? Because we are taking the weekdays: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday (which is the next weekday after Friday? but in the data, Monday is the last day).\n\n But note: the Monday we have is the day before the forecast day, so it might be the most relevant.\n\n However, we can also give more weight to the most recent day (Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). \n\n Let's try a weighted average:\n\n   forecast_h = (w1 * price_h_Tuesday + w2 * price_h_Wednesday + w3 * price_h_Thursday + w4 * price_h_Friday + w5 * price_h_Monday) / (w1+w2+w3+w4+w5)\n\n We can set weights: \n   w1 (Tuesday) = 1.0 (because same day of the week)\n   w2 (Wednesday) = 0.8\n   w3 (Thursday) = 0.7\n   w4 (Friday) = 0.6\n   w5 (Monday) = 1.2 (because it's the most recent weekday and the next day after Sunday, and the day before the forecast day)\n\n But this is arbitrary.\n\n Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing for the same hour across days.\n\n However, given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) for the forecast.\n\n But note: the pattern on Monday might be different from Tuesday? And we have only one Monday and one Tuesday.\n\n Let me check the data:\n\n   On Tuesday (2016-11-08): \n        peak at 17:00: 73.48\n   On Monday (2016-11-14): \n        the prices are much flatter and lower: the highest is 44.05 at 17:00.\n\n So the Monday was a low price day. The Tuesday we are forecasting might be more similar to the previous Tuesday? But we don't know.\n\n Without additional data, we have to rely on the available weekdays.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour over the 5 weekdays:\n\n   Weekdays: \n        2016-11-08 (Tuesday)\n        2016-11-09 (Wednesday)\n        2016-11-10 (Thursday)\n        2016-11-11 (Friday)\n        2016-11-14 (Monday)\n\n For each hour (0 to 23), we average the prices on these 5 days.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n        (37.91, 37.09, 37.39, 38.92, 35.66) -> average = (37.91+37.09+37.39+38.92+35.66)/5 = 37.394\n\n But note: the last Monday (2016-11-14) at hour0 was 35.66, which is lower. This might bring the average down.\n\n However, we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday had 37.91 at hour0. So if we use the average, we get 37.394, which is close to 37.91? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But we have only 5 points.\n\n Given the data, I will use the average of the same hour over the 5 weekdays.\n\n Steps:\n\n   For hour h (0 to 23):\n        values = [ price at h on 2016-11-08, 2016-11-09, 2016-11-10, 2016-11-11, 2016-11-14 ]\n        forecast_h = mean(values)\n\n But note: the day of the week for Monday is not the same as Tuesday. However, we are grouping all weekdays together.\n\n This method is simple and uses the available data.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2016-11-15 00:00 to 2016-11-15 23:00) using the above method.\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 5 weekdays.\n\n However, note: the data for 2016-11-14 (Monday) is the last day and might be more relevant? We could use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent day and the same day last week.\n\n But to keep it simple and given the instructions, we'll use the simple average.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use the last Tuesday (2016-11-08) and adjust by the difference between the last 24 hours (Monday) and the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the 5 weekdays for each hour.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (37.91, 37.09, 37.39, 38.92, 35.66) -> (37.91+37.09+37.39+38.92+35.66)/5 = 186.97/5 = 37.394\n Hour 1: (37.01, 36.37, 36.51, 37.13, 34.80) -> (37.01+36.37+36.51+37.13+34.80)/5 = 181.82/5 = 36.364\n Hour 2: (36.66, 35.47, 36.13, 36.64, 34.50) -> (36.66+35.47+36.13+36.64+34.50)/5 = 179.4/5 = 35.88\n Hour 3: (36.82, 35.39, 36.39, 36.59, 35.06) -> (36.82+35.39+36.39+36.59+35.06)/5 = 180.25/5 = 36.05\n Hour 4: (38.05, 36.37, 37.98, 38.49, 35.69) -> (38.05+36.37+37.98+38.49+35.69)/5 = 186.58/5 = 37.316\n Hour 5: (39.88, 39.44, 40.35, 40.53, 38.27) -> (39.88+39.44+40.35+40.53+38.27)/5 = 198.47/5 = 39.694\n Hour 6: (44.04, 43.76, 45.47, 45.65, 41.79) -> (44.04+43.76+45.47+45.65+41.79)/5 = 220.71/5 = 44.142\n Hour 7: (49.76, 51.09, 50.32, 56.02, 43.75) -> (49.76+51.09+50.32+56.02+43.75)/5 = 250.94/5 = 50.188\n Hour 8: (56.01, 52.09, 52.33, 55.93, 43.92) -> (56.01+52.09+52.33+55.93+43.92)/5 = 260.28/5 = 52.056\n Hour 9: (54.72, 51.46, 51.59, 54.51, 42.85) -> (54.72+51.46+51.59+54.51+42.85)/5 = 255.13/5 = 51.026\n Hour 10: (50.92, 48.93, 50.58, 50.76, 41.40) -> (50.92+48.93+50.58+50.76+41.40)/5 = 242.59/5 = 48.518\n Hour 11: (50.31, 50.59, 51.52, 48.44, 41.52) -> (50.31+50.59+51.52+48.44+41.52)/5 = 242.38/5 = 48.476\n Hour 12: (50.97, 52.03, 51.90, 48.48, 41.47) -> (50.97+52.03+51.90+48.48+41.47)/5 = 244.85/5 = 48.97\n Hour 13: (51.81, 51.80, 53.66, 48.09, 41.35) -> (51.81+51.80+53.66+48.09+41.35)/5 = 246.71/5 = 49.342\n Hour 14: (51.81, 50.10, 53.97, 45.98, 41.48) -> (51.81+50.10+53.97+45.98+41.48)/5 = 243.34/5 = 48.668\n Hour 15: (54.48, 51.11, 53.59, 47.15, 41.97) -> (54.48+51.11+53.59+47.15+41.97)/5 = 248.3/5 = 49.66\n Hour 16: (59.88, 59.58, 54.95, 50.50, 43.42) -> (59.88+59.58+54.95+50.50+43.42)/5 = 268.33/5 = 53.666\n Hour 17: (73.48, 62.19, 63.50, 54.56, 44.05) -> (73.48+62.19+63.50+54.56+44.05)/5 = 297.78/5 = 59.556\n Hour 18: (58.98, 56.30, 53.65, 51.11, 42.94) -> (58.98+56.30+53.65+51.11+42.94)/5 = 262.98/5 = 52.596\n Hour 19: (50.36, 51.73, 49.82, 48.47, 40.79) -> (50.36+51.73+49.82+48.47+40.79)/5 = 241.17/5 = 48.234\n Hour 20: (43.68, 45.45, 45.51, 44.08, 39.86) -> (43.68+45.45+45.51+44.08+39.86)/5 = 218.58/5 = 43.716\n Hour 21: (41.42, 42.44, 42.52, 41.61, 38.64) -> (41.42+42.44+42.52+41.61+38.64)/5 = 206.63/5 = 41.326\n Hour 22: (40.03, 40.32, 40.31, 41.19, 36.41) -> (40.03+40.32+40.31+41.19+36.41)/5 = 198.26/5 = 39.652\n Hour 23: (38.09, 38.55, 38.68, 39.50, 35.25) -> (38.09+38.55+38.68+39.50+35.25)/5 = 190.07/5 = 38.014\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2016-11-15:\n\n   00:00: 37.394\n   01:00: 36.364\n   02:00: 35.88\n   03:00: 36.05\n   04:00: 37.316\n   05:00: 39.694\n   06:00: 44.142\n   07:00: 50.188\n   08:00: 52.056\n   09:00: 51.026\n   10:00: 48.518\n   11:00: 48.476\n   12:00: 48.97\n   13:00: 49.342\n   14:00: 48.668\n   15:00: 49.66\n   16:00: 53.666\n   17:00: 59.556\n   18:00: 52.596\n   19:00: 48.234\n   20:00: 43.716\n   21:00: 41.326\n   22:00: 39.652\n   23:00: 38.014\n\n But note: the last Monday (2016-11-14) was a particularly low price day, which might be an outlier?
