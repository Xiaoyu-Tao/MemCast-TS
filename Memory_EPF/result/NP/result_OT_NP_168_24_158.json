        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016/1/12 0:00 to 2016/1/18 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016/1/19 0:00 to 2016/1/19 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we note that the data is given in chronological order and there are no explicit missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n\n 3. Given the nature of electricity prices, we observe:\n    - Strong daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Possible weekly seasonality (though we have only one week of data, so we can rely on daily patterns more)\n    - The data shows volatility, especially during peak hours (mornings and evenings) and sometimes very high prices (e.g., 95.03, 89.65).\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day (or the same day of the previous week). However, we only have 7 days of data. \n\n    Considering the data, we note that the pattern of the last day (2016/1/18) might be the most relevant. But also note that the day of the week matters: \n    2016/1/12 (Tuesday) to 2016/1/18 (Monday). The next day is 2016/1/19 (Tuesday). \n\n    Therefore, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2016/1/12) as a base, but we also note that the pattern of the last day (Monday) might be different.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the available days. However, the data shows that the pattern on weekdays (Tuesday to Monday) might be different from weekends (Saturday and Sunday). \n\n    The data includes:\n        Tuesday (2016/1/12), Wednesday (2016/1/13), Thursday (2016/1/14), Friday (2016/1/15), Saturday (2016/1/16), Sunday (2016/1/17), Monday (2016/1/18)\n\n    The next day is Tuesday (2016/1/19). So we can take the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2016/1/12) and also consider the Monday (2016/1/18) as the most recent day? \n\n    But note: the problem does not provide any exogenous variables and we are limited to univariate.\n\n 6. Given the simplicity and the requirement for a quick forecast, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from the previous week and the most recent day (Monday) to capture the most recent trend. However, without more data, we have to be cautious.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a moving window or exponential smoothing. But we are not provided with a model, so we have to use a simple heuristic.\n\n 7. Approach: \n    We note that the prices on 2016/1/12 (Tuesday) and 2016/1/18 (Monday) are both weekdays and might be similar. However, the Monday (2016/1/18) had very high prices in the morning and evening. \n\n    Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday, and we have only one previous Tuesday, we can use that as a base. But we also note that the overall level of prices might have changed in the last week.\n\n    We can adjust the base Tuesday (2016/1/12) by the trend observed from the last two days. \n\n    However, a simpler and common method in electricity price forecasting is the \"similar day\" method. We choose the most recent similar day (which is the same day of the week, i.e., the previous Tuesday) and then adjust it by the most recent day's overall level.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for all the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday and Monday) excluding the weekend? But note: the next day is a weekday (Tuesday). We have 5 weekdays: 12th,13th,14th,15th,18th (Monday) and 2 weekend days: 16th,17th.\n\n    We can compute the average for each hour over the 5 weekdays and use that as the forecast.\n\n 8. Let's do:\n    For each hour h (0 to 23), let:\n        forecast_h = average of the price at hour h on 2016/1/12, 2016/1/13, 2016/1/14, 2016/1/15, 2016/1/18\n\n    But note: the data on 2016/1/18 (Monday) had very high prices. We are including it.\n\n 9. However, we must consider that the prices on Monday 2016/1/18 were exceptionally high. We can also try to use the median to avoid outliers? But let's see the data:\n\n    For example, at 8:00 (hour 8):\n        2016/1/12: 40.29\n        2016/1/13: 34.12\n        2016/1/14: 57.07\n        2016/1/15: 88.08\n        2016/1/18: 89.61\n\n    The average for 8:00: (40.29+34.12+57.07+88.08+89.61)/5 = 309.17/5 = 61.834\n\n    But the previous Tuesday (2016/1/12) was 40.29 and the Monday was 89.61. The average might be too high if Monday was an outlier.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of extreme values. The median of the above: [34.12, 40.29, 57.07, 88.08, 89.61] -> 57.07.\n\n 11. However, note that the problem does not specify the method. Since we are an expert, we can choose a robust method.\n\n 12. Considering the volatility and the possibility of outliers, we decide to use the median of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (excluding the weekend) for the forecast.\n\n 13. Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        Collect the prices for that hour from the 5 weekdays: \n            Day1: 2016/1/12 (Tuesday)\n            Day2: 2016/1/13 (Wednesday)\n            Day3: 2016/1/14 (Thursday)\n            Day4: 2016/1/15 (Friday)\n            Day5: 2016/1/18 (Monday)   [Note: Monday is the next weekday in the cycle? But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we have one Tuesday in the past?]\n\n    14. Why median? Because it is robust to outliers. For example, on hour 8:00, the median is 57.07, which is less influenced by the extreme Monday and Friday.\n\n 15. But note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included because they are not the same type of day of the week as Tuesday.\n\n 16. However, we have only one Tuesday in the past. So if we use the median of the 5 weekdays, we are including different days. This is acceptable because we are assuming that weekdays have similar patterns, but we note that Monday and Friday might have different patterns than Tuesday. \n\n 17. Alternatively, we can use only the previous Tuesday (2016/1/12) and adjust it by the overall change in the level of prices. But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n 18. Given the data, we are going to use the median of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (the 5 weekdays we have).\n\n 19. Let's compute the forecast for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00 for 2016/1/19.\n\n 20. We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then take the median of the 5 values.\n\n 21. Example for hour 0:00 (the first hour):\n        Days: \n            2016/1/12 0:00 -> 21.20\n            2016/1/13 0:00 -> 21.06\n            2016/1/14 0:00 -> 23.47\n            2016/1/15 0:00 -> 23.96\n            2016/1/18 0:00 -> 23.59\n        Sort: [21.06, 21.20, 23.47, 23.59, 23.96] -> median = 23.47\n\n 22. Similarly, we do for all hours.\n\n 23. But note: the data for 2016/1/18 is the most recent day and might be more indicative? However, we are using the median so it will be robust.\n\n 24. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 25. However, we must note that the median might smooth out the peaks. But looking at the data, the peaks occur at different times on different days. \n\n 26. Let's compute the forecast for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0: [21.20, 21.06, 23.47, 23.96, 23.59] -> sorted: 21.06, 21.20, 23.47, 23.59, 23.96 -> median = 23.47\n    Hour 1: [19.90, 19.72, 22.55, 24.02, 23.24] -> sorted: 19.72, 19.90, 22.55, 23.24, 24.02 -> median = 22.55\n    Hour 2: [19.19, 18.77, 22.18, 23.25, 23.28] -> sorted: 18.77, 19.19, 22.18, 23.25, 23.28 -> median = 22.18\n    Hour 3: [18.48, 18.71, 22.01, 22.90, 23.31] -> sorted: 18.48, 18.71, 22.01, 22.90, 23.31 -> median = 22.01\n    Hour 4: [19.20, 19.49, 22.58, 24.54, 24.32] -> sorted: 19.20, 19.49, 22.58, 24.32, 24.54 -> median = 22.58\n    Hour 5: [21.66, 21.75, 25.06, 25.75, 26.47] -> sorted: 21.66, 21.75, 25.06, 25.75, 26.47 -> median = 25.06\n    Hour 6: [24.19, 24.47, 31.62, 29.67, 32.84] -> sorted: 24.19, 24.47, 29.67, 31.62, 32.84 -> median = 29.67\n    Hour 7: [35.34, 33.05, 41.42, 46.60, 79.86] -> sorted: 33.05, 35.34, 41.42, 46.60, 79.86 -> median = 41.42\n    Hour 8: [40.29, 34.12, 57.07, 88.08, 89.61] -> sorted: 34.12, 40.29, 57.07, 88.08, 89.61 -> median = 57.07\n    Hour 9: [41.17, 33.91, 53.38, 83.06, 75.95] -> sorted: 33.91, 41.17, 53.38, 75.95, 83.06 -> median = 53.38\n    Hour 10: [39.35, 32.11, 44.05, 51.98, 51.84] -> sorted: 32.11, 39.35, 44.05, 51.84, 51.98 -> median = 44.05\n    Hour 11: [38.84, 33.63, 40.38, 50.36, 51.45] -> sorted: 33.63, 38.84, 40.38, 50.36, 51.45 -> median = 40.38\n    Hour 12: [38.58, 34.89, 45.44, 51.42, 55.48] -> sorted: 34.89, 38.58, 45.44, 51.42, 55.48 -> median = 45.44\n    Hour 13: [37.59, 34.95, 44.05, 43.06, 56.44] -> sorted: 34.95, 37.59, 43.06, 44.05, 56.44 -> median = 43.06\n    Hour 14: [38.80, 35.26, 44.04, 37.95, 55.46] -> sorted: 35.26, 37.95, 38.80, 44.04, 55.46 -> median = 38.80\n    Hour 15: [41.52, 43.44, 49.92, 43.05, 69.86] -> sorted: 41.52, 43.05, 43.44, 49.92, 69.86 -> median = 43.44\n    Hour 16: [44.63, 75.00, 95.03, 49.97, 89.65] -> sorted: 44.63, 49.97, 75.00, 89.65, 95.03 -> median = 75.00\n    Hour 17: [45.56, 78.86, 95.03, 82.18, 91.04] -> sorted: 45.56, 78.86, 82.18, 91.04, 95.03 -> median = 82.18\n    Hour 18: [40.05, 54.42, 91.09, 53.53, 76.24] -> sorted: 40.05, 53.53, 54.42, 76.24, 91.09 -> median = 54.42\n    Hour 19: [29.41, 34.99, 44.41, 37.91, 48.60] -> sorted: 29.41, 34.99, 37.91, 44.41, 48.60 -> median = 37.91\n    Hour 20: [25.94, 28.20, 33.67, 31.64, 34.99] -> sorted: 25.94, 28.20, 31.64, 33.67, 34.99 -> median = 31.64\n    Hour 21: [25.72, 26.92, 30.86, 28.58, 29.27] -> sorted: 25.72, 26.92, 28.58, 29.27, 30.86 -> median = 28.58\n    Hour 22: [23.66, 25.45, 28.31, 27.48, 25.60] -> sorted: 23.66, 25.45, 25.60, 27.48, 28.31 -> median = 25.60\n    Hour 23: [21.58, 22.95, 25.29, 25.05, 23.91] -> sorted: 21.58, 22.95, 23.91, 25.05, 25.29 -> median = 23.91\n\n 27.

We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple and robust method. In practice, more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning models) would be used, but given the constraints (only 168 hours of univariate) and the requirement for a quick forecast, this is acceptable.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required XML-like format.\n",
