        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/8/26 0:00 to 2014/9/1 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2014/9/2 0:00 to 2014/9/2 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points). But we are told that some data may contain missing values. In this case, we don't have missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods.\n\n 3. Given the data, we observe:\n    - Strong daily seasonality (prices are higher during the day and lower at night)\n    - Also, we might see weekly patterns? But we only have one week of data.\n\n 4. We can use a simple method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day (or same day of the week? but we have only one week, so we can use the same day of the previous week? but we don't have that because we only have 7 days). \n    - Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But note: the last day in the data is Monday (2014/9/1). We are forecasting the next day which is Tuesday (2014/9/2). \n\n    However, we have:\n        Day 1: Tuesday (2014/8/26) -> we have data for Tuesday? Actually, 2014/8/26 is a Tuesday? Let me check: \n        We have 2014/8/26 (Tuesday), 8/27 (Wednesday), 8/28 (Thursday), 8/29 (Friday), 8/30 (Saturday), 8/31 (Sunday), 9/1 (Monday).\n\n        We are forecasting 9/2, which is Tuesday.\n\n    So we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014/8/26) as a naive forecast? But note: the data might have changed over the week.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, without additional features, we can try to capture the daily pattern.\n\n 6. Let's consider: for each hour of the day (0 to 23), we can take the average of that hour over the last 7 days? But note: the last 7 days include different days of the week. We are forecasting a Tuesday, so we can take the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (only one Tuesday in the data) and then adjust with the recent trend? \n\n 7. Since we have only one week, we can see that the weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) have higher prices during the day and weekends (Sat, Sun) have lower. The Monday (9/1) is also a weekday.\n\n 8. We can try to compute the average for each hour over the last 7 days and then adjust by the difference between the last day (Monday) and the average of Mondays? But we only have one Monday.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Use the last day (Monday, 9/1) as a base and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday (8/26) and the previous Monday (8/25) but we don't have 8/25.\n\n 10. Since we don't have data before 8/26, we cannot do that.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday and then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then Monday? \n\n 12. Considering the limitations, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days and also to the same day of the week. However, with only 7 days, we can do:\n\n     Let H = [0,1,...,23] for the hour of the day.\n\n     We are going to forecast for hour h on 2014/9/2 (Tuesday) as:\n\n        forecast_h = (w1 * value_h_prev_tuesday + w2 * value_h_prev_day + w3 * (average of the same hour over the last 7 days))\n\n     But we don't have a good way to set weights.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only asked for a forecast, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out noise.\n\n 14. However, note that the last 7 days include both weekdays and weekends. The day we are forecasting (Tuesday) is a weekday. The last 7 days: \n        Day 1: Tuesday (weekday)\n        Day 2: Wednesday (weekday)\n        Day 3: Thursday (weekday)\n        Day 4: Friday (weekday)\n        Day 5: Saturday (weekend)\n        Day 6: Sunday (weekend)\n        Day 7: Monday (weekday)\n\n     So if we take the average, the weekend days (which are lower) might pull down the forecast for a weekday.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can take the average of the same hour only for the weekdays in the last 7 days? That would be: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday (5 days). \n\n 16. Let's do that: for each hour h (0 to 23), we take the average of the price at hour h on the weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon) in the data.\n\n 17. How to compute:\n\n     Hour 0: \n        Tue (8/26): 32.00\n        Wed (8/27): 31.65\n        Thu (8/28): 30.68\n        Fri (8/29): 30.85\n        Mon (9/1): 31.35\n        Average = (32.00 + 31.65 + 30.68 + 30.85 + 31.35) / 5 = 31.306\n\n     Similarly for each hour.\n\n 18. But note: the data might have a trend? We can see that the prices on the last day (Monday) are generally lower than the previous Tuesday? \n        On Tuesday (8/26) at 0:00: 32.00, on 9/1 (Monday) at 0:00: 31.35 -> a slight decrease.\n\n 19. We can adjust by the overall trend? We can compute the average of the entire last day (9/1) and the average of the previous Tuesday (8/26) and then adjust by the ratio? \n\n        Let A1 = average of Tuesday (8/26) = average of 24 hours on 8/26.\n        Let A2 = average of Monday (9/1) = average of 24 hours on 9/1.\n\n        Then the trend factor = A2 / A1.\n\n        Then our forecast for the next Tuesday (9/2) for hour h would be: \n            forecast_h = (average_weekday_h) * (A2 / A1)\n\n     But note: we are using 5 weekdays to compute the average_weekday_h, so we are already including the trend? \n\n 20. Alternatively, we can use a multiplicative seasonal adjustment? \n\n 21. Given time, we'll go with the simple average of the same hour over the 5 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon) without trend adjustment.\n\n 22. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n     We have the following weekdays:\n\n        Tue (8/26): indices 0 to 23\n        Wed (8/27): indices 24 to 47\n        Thu (8/28): indices 48 to 71\n        Fri (8/29): indices 72 to 95\n        Mon (9/1): indices 144 to 167\n\n     We can extract the same hour from each of these days.\n\n 23. Steps:\n\n     For hour h in [0,23]:\n        values = [ \n            data[h + 0*24],   # Tue\n            data[h + 1*24],   # Wed\n            data[h + 2*24],   # Thu\n            data[h + 3*24],   # Fri\n            data[h + 6*24]    # Mon (because 6 days after Tue: 0,145,...,167 -> index 144 to 167 is the 7th day? Actually, the first day is index0: 0-23, then 24-47, 48-71, 72-95, 96-119 (Sat), 120-143 (Sun), 144-167 (Mon). So for hour h, the Monday is at index 144+h.\n        ]\n\n     Then average = sum(values) / 5\n\n 24. But note: the data we are given is in order, so we can create a list of the 168 prices.\n\n 25. Let me index the data:\n\n        index 0: 2014/8/26 0:00 -> 32.00\n        index 1: 2014/8/26 1:00 -> 31.64\n        ...\n        index 23: 2014/8/26 23:00 -> 32.83\n        index 24: 2014/8/27 0:00 -> 31.65\n        ...\n        index 167: 2014/9/1 23:00 -> 32.63\n\n 26. For hour h (0 to 23) in the day, we want:\n\n        h0: h = 0 -> indices: 0, 24, 48, 72, 144\n        values = [32.00, 31.65, 30.68, 30.85, 31.35] -> average = (32.00+31.65+30.68+30.85+31.35)/5 = 156.53/5 = 31.306\n\n        h1: h=1 -> indices: 1, 25, 49, 73, 145 -> [31.64, 30.28, 29.49, 30.57, 31.15] \n            = 31.64+30.28+29.49+30.57+31.15 = 153.13 /5 = 30.626\n\n        ... and so on.\n\n 27. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. However, note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are excluded. This might be reasonable because weekdays have similar patterns and weekends are different.\n\n 29. Let's compute the 24 averages:\n\n        h0: (32.00 + 31.65 + 30.68 + 30.85 + 31.35) / 5 = 156.53/5 = 31.306\n        h1: (31.64 + 30.28 + 29.49 + 30.57 + 31.15) / 5 = 153.13/5 = 30.626\n        h2: (31.53 + 29.83 + 29.01 + 30.36 + 31.02) / 5 = 151.75/5 = 30.350\n        h3: (31.52 + 29.70 + 29.04 + 30.47 + 31.08) / 5 = 151.81/5 = 30.362\n        h4: (31.73 + 30.05 + 29.56 + 30.64 + 31.36) / 5 = 153.34/5 = 30.668\n        h5: (32.74 + 31.35 + 31.21 + 31.15 + 32.78) / 5 = 159.23/5 = 31.846\n        h6: (34.17 + 34.52 + 34.30 + 33.16 + 34.46) / 5 = 170.61/5 = 34.122\n        h7: (38.89 + 37.89 + 36.95 + 36.09 + 36.83) / 5 = 186.65/5 = 37.330\n        h8: (39.91 + 37.76 + 37.84 + 36.78 + 37.52) / 5 = 189.81/5 = 37.962\n        h9: (40.98 + 37.55 + 36.97 + 36.79 + 37.42) / 5 = 189.71/5 = 37.942\n        h10: (41.08 + 37.46 + 36.99 + 36.77 + 37.60) / 5 = 189.90/5 = 37.980\n        h11: (39.96 + 37.53 + 37.22 + 36.73 + 37.56) / 5 = 189.00/5 = 37.800\n        h12: (38.75 + 37.72 + 36.49 + 36.47 + 37.30) / 5 = 186.73/5 = 37.346\n        h13: (38.64 + 36.93 + 36.05 + 35.94 + 36.98) / 5 = 184.54/5 = 36.908\n        h14: (38.07 + 36.57 + 35.41 + 34.95 + 36.12) / 5 = 181.12/5 = 36.224\n        h15: (37.83 + 36.18 + 34.92 + 34.25 + 35.25) / 5 = 178.43/5 = 35.686\n        h16: (37.60 + 34.97 + 34.95 + 33.61 + 35.04) / 5 = 176.17/5 = 35.234\n        h17: (37.06 + 36.88 + 36.75 + 34.10 + 35.28) / 5 = 180.07/5 = 36.014\n        h18: (36.96 + 37.19 + 36.71 + 34.81 + 36.01) / 5 = 181.68/5 = 36.336\n        h19: (37.14 + 37.90 + 36.85 + 34.69 + 36.86) / 5 = 183.44/5 = 36.688\n        h20: (37.48 + 38.05 + 37.72 + 34.64 + 37.11) / 5 = 185.00/5 = 37.000\n        h21: (37.30 + 38.39 + 36.92 + 33.79 + 35.93) / 5 = 182.33/5 = 36.466\n        h22: (35.81 + 36.58 + 35.80 + 33.08 + 34.18) / 5 = 175.45/5 = 35.090\n        h23: (32.83 + 32.47 + 32.36 + 31.39 + 32.63) / 5 = 161.68/5 = 32.336\n\n 30. So the forecast for 2014/9/2 (Tuesday) from 0:00 to 23:00 would be:\n\n        0:00: 31.306\n        1:00: 30.626\n        2:00: 30.350\n        3:00: 30.362\n        4:00: 30.668\n        5:00: 31.846\n        6:00: 34.122\n        7:00: 37.330\n        8:00: 37.962\n        9:00: 37.942\n        10:00: 37.980\n        11:00: 37.800\n        12:00: 37.346\n        13:00: 36.908\n        14:00: 36.224\n        15:00: 35.686\n        16:00: 35.234\n        17:00: 36.014\n        18:00: 36.336\n        19:00: 36.688\n        20:00: 37.000\n        21:00: 36.466\n        22:00: 35.090\n        23:00: 32.336\n\n 31. We output these values in the required format.\n\n 32. Note: This is a simple average and does not account for any recent trend. But given the data, it's a reasonable approach.\n\n 33. Format the answer:\n\n        <answer>\n          2014/9/2 0:00 31.31\n          2014/9/2 1:00 30.63\n          ... \n\n     We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 34. However, note: the input has two decimal places. We computed with more precision, so we round to two.\n\n 35. Let me recompute with rounding:\n\n        h0: 31.306 -> 31.31\n        h1: 30.626 -> 30.63\n        h2: 30.350 -> 30.35\n        h3: 30.362 -> 30.36\n        h4: 30.668 -> 30.67\n        h5: 31.846 -> 31.85\n        h6: 34.122 -> 34.12\n        h7: 37.330 -> 37.33\n        h8: 37.962 -> 37.96\n        h9: 37.942 -> 37.94\n        h10: 37.980 -> 37.98\n        h11: 37.800 -> 37.80\n        h12: 37.346 -> 37.35\n        h13: 36.908 -> 36.91\n        h14: 36.224 -> 36.22\n        h15: 35.686 -> 35.69\n        h16: 35.234 -> 35.23\n        h17: 36.014 -> 36.01\n        h18: 36.336 -> 36.34\n        h19: 36.688 -> 36.69\n        h20: 37.000 -> 37.00\n        h21: 36.466 -> 36.47\n        h22: 35.090 -> 35.09\n        h23: 32.336 -> 32.34\n\n 36.
