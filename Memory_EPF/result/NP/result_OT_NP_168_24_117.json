        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015-03-31 00:00 to 2015-04-06 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2015-04-07 00:00 to 2015-04-07 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 records). No missing values to handle in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed price) and the date. We don't have the grid load or wind power forecasts for the future, so we must rely on time series forecasting of the price alone.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given historical prices, we can use a time series model. Given the daily seasonality (24 hours) and the short-term nature, we can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any)\n   - Seasonality (daily pattern)\n\n We note that the data is for 7 days (168 hours). We can use a seasonal decomposition and then forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n However, note that the problem does not provide any exogenous variables (like load or wind) for the future, so we cannot use them.\n\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term electricity price: \n   - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the same day of the previous week. But note that the data we have ends on 2015-04-06 (Monday). \n        The next day is 2015-04-07 (Tuesday). So we can take the values from the previous Tuesday (2015-03-31) which was a Tuesday? \n        Actually, 2015-03-31 was a Tuesday? Let's check: \n          2015-03-31: Tuesday? (We can check a calendar or note the pattern)\n\n        Actually, 2015-04-06 was a Monday, so 2015-04-07 is a Tuesday. The previous Tuesday in our data is 2015-03-31 (which is the first day of our data). \n\n        But note: our data starts on 2015-03-31 (Tuesday) and ends on 2015-04-06 (Monday). So the next day is Tuesday 2015-04-07.\n\n        We can use the values from 2015-03-31 (Tuesday) for 2015-04-07 (Tuesday). However, but note that the pattern might have changed over the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the last few days at the same hour? Or use a moving average? \n\n But the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated model. However, without additional data (like load forecasts and wind power forecasts) we are limited.\n\n Given the constraints, we can use:\n   - Exponential Smoothing (with daily seasonality) \n   - ARIMA with seasonal component (SARIMA)\n\n But note: we have only 168 points (7 days). Fitting a SARIMA model might be challenging because we need to choose parameters and the seasonality is 24.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour of the last 7 days? \n\n However, the problem says to handle missing values carefully, but we don't have any in the provided data.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to act as an expert, we choose a method that is commonly used for short-term electricity price forecasting: \n   - We can use a seasonal naive method for the same hour of the previous week, but adjusted by the average change over the week? \n\n But note: the data shows a slight downward trend? Let's see:\n\n   The first day (2015-03-31) average: \n        0:00 to 23:00: average = (23.36+23.09+...+23.82)/24 = let's compute roughly: \n        We can see the values are around 25. So let's compute the average for each day:\n\n        Day 1 (2015-03-31): \n            sum = 23.36+23.09+22.72+22.69+23.38+24.10+25.04+26.00+26.69+26.95+26.82+26.54+25.87+25.69+25.52+25.31+25.07+25.18+25.32+25.16+24.92+24.76+24.42+23.82\n            = 600.32\n            average = 600.32/24 = 25.0133\n\n        Day 2 (2015-04-01): \n            = 23.97+23.59+23.38+22.98+23.64+24.66+25.60+26.71+26.88+26.45+26.00+25.63+25.38+25.29+24.78+24.64+24.67+25.01+25.58+25.89+25.72+25.67+25.25+24.18\n            = 600.61\n            average = 600.61/24 = 25.0254\n\n        Day 3 (2015-04-02): \n            = 24.40+23.78+23.65+24.06+24.37+25.04+25.76+26.12+26.26+26.20+26.02+25.89+25.68+25.48+25.15+24.70+24.22+24.87+25.34+25.61+25.58+25.37+25.05+24.45\n            = 600.55\n            average = 600.55/24 = 25.0229\n\n        Day 4 (2015-04-03): \n            = 24.23+23.76+23.69+23.76+23.93+24.01+24.15+24.64+24.81+24.99+25.05+25.03+24.83+24.63+24.23+24.09+24.38+25.07+25.62+25.86+25.81+25.80+25.69+25.54\n            = 595.19\n            average = 24.7996\n\n        Day 5 (2015-04-04): \n            = 25.67+25.47+25.51+25.38+25.10+25.29+25.40+25.76+25.97+26.32+26.31+25.98+25.58+25.12+24.91+24.81+24.86+25.44+25.72+25.91+25.91+25.90+25.79+25.56\n            = 616.86\n            average = 25.7025\n\n        Day 6 (2015-04-05): \n            = 25.84+25.62+25.42+25.08+24.60+24.72+24.62+24.72+25.41+25.33+25.33+25.34+24.82+24.56+24.41+24.36+24.41+24.61+25.59+26.04+26.40+26.40+26.13+25.75\n            = 602.49\n            average = 25.10375\n\n        Day 7 (2015-04-06): \n            = 25.94+25.17+24.52+24.40+24.62+24.79+24.98+25.05+25.52+25.75+25.93+26.14+25.98+25.21+24.78+24.63+24.86+25.05+26.06+26.28+26.30+26.11+25.95+25.48\n            = 608.00\n            average = 25.3333\n\n        The daily averages: \n          25.0133, 25.0254, 25.0229, 24.7996, 25.7025, 25.10375, 25.3333\n\n        There is no clear trend. The values are between 24.8 and 25.7. \n\n        We can use the seasonal naive method: \n          For hour 0: use the value from 2015-03-31 0:00 (which is 23.36) for 2015-04-07 0:00? \n          But note: 2015-03-31 was 7 days ago and the pattern might have changed.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? \n\n        However, the problem says we are an expert and we should use a more sophisticated method. But without additional data, we are limited.\n\n        Another idea: use a weighted average of the last few days at the same hour, with more weight to the most recent.\n\n        We can use an Exponential Smoothing for each hour of the day. For each hour h (0 to 23), we have 7-day history. We can use:\n\n          Forecast_{t+1, h} = alpha * Y_{t, h} + (1-alpha) * (previous forecast for that hour)\n\n        But we only have 7 points per hour. We can set alpha=0.5 and use the average of the last 3 days for that hour? \n\n        However, for simplicity and given the data, we can use the average of the same hour of the last 3 days (or 7 days) to capture the daily pattern.\n\n        Let's try with the last 3 days (which includes the most recent pattern) for the same hour.\n\n        For example, for 2015-04-07 00:00:\n          We take the same hour (0:00) from:\n            2015-04-06: 25.94\n            2015-04-05: 25.84\n            2015-04-04: 25.67\n          Average = (25.94+25.84+25.67)/3 = 25.8167\n\n        But note: the day of the week effect? The next day is Tuesday, and we have a Tuesday in our data (2015-03-31) which was 7 days ago. \n        We might want to include that? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same day of the week (Tuesday) from the previous week and then adjust by the recent trend? \n\n        However, we don't have a clear trend. \n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that we are only using the price, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. \n\n        Why 7? Because we have exactly 7 days. This will capture the daily pattern and average out any daily variations.\n\n        So for each hour h in [0,23]:\n            forecast_h = (Y_{day1, h} + Y_{day2, h} + ... + Y_{day7, h}) / 7\n\n        But note: the days are:\n            day1: 2015-03-31 (Tuesday)\n            day2: 2015-04-01 (Wednesday)\n            day3: 2015-04-02 (Thursday)\n            day4: 2015-04-03 (Friday)\n            day5: 2015-04-04 (Saturday)\n            day6: 2015-04-05 (Sunday)\n            day7: 2015-04-06 (Monday)\n\n        And we are forecasting for 2015-04-07 (Tuesday). So we are including one Tuesday (the same day) from a week ago and the other days.\n\n        This might be acceptable because the pattern on Tuesday might be similar to the pattern on Monday? But actually, weekdays and weekends have different patterns.\n\n        We can we do? We can use only the weekdays? But our forecast day is a Tuesday, so we can use the average of the same hour of the last 3 weekdays? \n\n        However, we have only one Tuesday in the data. \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the same day of the week: we have one Tuesday (2015-03-31) and then we can use the average of the other weekdays? \n\n        But that might not be enough.\n\n        Given the constraints, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Sunday, Monday, and Saturday) for the forecast? \n        But that would not capture the Tuesday pattern.\n\n        Another idea: use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2015-03-31) and then adjust by the average change from that Tuesday to the next days? \n\n        This is getting complex.\n\n        Let me check the pattern for hour 0:00 over the 7 days:\n\n          2015-03-31 0:00: 23.36\n          2015-04-01 0:00: 23.97\n          2015-04-02 0:00: 24.40\n          2015-04-03 0:00: 24.23\n          2015-04-04 0:00: 25.67\n          2015-04-05 0:00: 25.84\n          2015-04-06 0:00: 25.94\n\n        The Tuesday value (23.36) is lower than the following days. So if we average all 7, we get:\n\n          (23.36+23.97+24.40+24.23+25.67+25.84+25.94)/7 = 24.772\n\n        But if we use only the last 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday): \n          (25.67+25.84+25.94)/3 = 25.8167\n\n        Which one is better? The last 3 days are higher. Since the price has been increasing in the last days, we might want to use the last 3 days.\n\n        However, the day we are forecasting is a weekday (Tuesday) and the last 3 days include weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and Monday. \n        Weekends might have different patterns.\n\n        We can use the average of the same hour for the same type of day? We have:\n\n          Weekdays: \n            Tuesday: 2015-03-31 -> 23.36\n            Wednesday: 2015-04-01 -> 23.97\n            Thursday: 2015-04-02 -> 24.40\n            Friday: 2015-04-03 -> 24.23\n            Monday: 2015-04-06 -> 25.94\n\n          Weekends:\n            Saturday: 2015-04-04 -> 25.67\n            Sunday: 2015-04-05 -> 25.84\n\n        For Tuesday, we have only one data point (23.36). We can use the average of the weekdays for that hour? \n\n        For hour 0:00, the weekdays average: (23.36+23.97+24.40+24.23+25.94)/5 = 24.38\n\n        But note that the Monday (25.94) is the most recent and might be more relevant. \n\n        We can use a weighted average: more weight to the same day of the week and to the most recent days? \n\n        However, without a clear method, and given the simplicity, we decide to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. \n\n        This is a simple and common baseline.\n\n        Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and average the 7 values.\n\n        Hour 0: (23.36+23.97+24.40+24.23+25.67+25.84+25.94)/7 = (23.36+23.97=47.33; +24.40=71.73; +24.23=95.96; +25.67=121.63; +25.84=147.47; +25.94=173.41) -> 173.41/7 = 24.772857 -> 24.77\n\n        Similarly, we do for all hours.\n\n        But note: the problem says we are an expert. We might want to use a more sophisticated method. However, without additional data and without a clear trend, the 7-day average is a reasonable baseline.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the median? But the average is common.\n\n        We'll use the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n        Steps:\n          For hour h in 0..23:\n            values = [ price at h on day1, day2, ..., day7 ]\n            forecast_h = mean(values)\n\n        Then we output the forecast for 2015-04-07 from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n        Let's compute:\n\n        Hour 0: [23.36, 23.97, 24.40, 24.23, 25.67, 25.84, 25.94] -> mean = 24.7729 -> 24.77\n        Hour 1: [23.09, 23.59, 23.78, 23.76, 25.47, 25.62, 25.17] -> \n            23.09+23.59=46.68;

But we did intermediate rounding for display? Actually, we should compute the average and then round.\n\n        We did: \n          Hour0: 24.7729 -> 24.77\n          Hour1: 24.3543 -> 24.35\n\n        So we are rounding to two decimals.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n          2015/4/7 0:00 24.77\n          2015/4/7 1:00 24.35\n          2015/4/7 2:00 24.13\n          2015/4/7 3:00 24.05\n          2015/4/7 4:00 24.23\n          2015/4/7 5:00 24.66\n          2015/4/7 6:00 25.08\n          2015/4/7 7:00 25.57\n          2015/4/7 8:00 25.93\n          2015/4/7 9:00 26.00\n          2015/4/7 10:00 25.92\n          2015/4/7 11:00 25.79\n          2015/4/7 12:00 25.45\n          2015/4/7 13:00 25.14\n          2015/4/7 14:00 24.83\n          2015/4/7 15:00 24.65\n          2015/4/7 16:00 24.64\n          2015/4/7 17:00 25.03\n          2015/4/7 18:00 25.60\n          2015/4/7 19:00 25.82\n          2015/4/7 20:00 25.81\n          2015/4/7 21:00 25.72\n          2015/4/7 22:00 25.47\n          2015/4/7 23:00 24.97\n\n        This is our forecast.\n\n        However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we should use a more sophisticated method? But without additional data (like grid load and wind power) and without a clear trend, this is a reasonable baseline.\n\n        We'll go with this.\n\n        Let me double-check one: Hour 0: \n          23.36, 23.97, 24.40, 24.23, 25.67, 25.84, 25.94\n          Sum = 23.36+23.97=47.33; 47.33+24.40=71.73; 71.73+24.23=95.96; 95.96+25.67=121.63; 121.63+25.84=147.47; 147.47+25.94=173.41 -> 173.41/7=24.772857 -> 24.77 (correct)\n\n        We are confident.\n\n        We output the answer in the required format.\n\n        Note: The date format in the input was with a space for the day? We'll use the same format: \n          \"2015/4/7 0:00\" (without the leading space for the day? The input had a space for the day when the day was single digit? Actually, the input used:\n\n          \"2015/3/31 0:00\" -> no leading space for the month? Actually, the month is 3 and 4, so we use 4 for April.\n\n          The input for April 1 was: \" 2015/4/1 0:00\" with a space? Actually, the input had:\n\n          \" 2015/3/31 0:00\" -> one space at the beginning? But then for April 1: \"  2015/4/1 0:00\" with two spaces? \n\n          Actually, the alignment in the problem statement was for pretty printing. We don't need to align. We can output:\n\n          \"2015/4/7 0:00\" without any extra space.\n\n        We'll output:\n\n          <answer>\n2015/4/7 0:00 24.77\n2015/4/7 1:00 24.35\n... etc.\n\n        </answer>\n\n        We'll write the 24 lines.\n\n        Let's do it.\n",
