        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2017/2/21 0:00 to 2017/2/27 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2017/2/28 0:00 to 2017/2/28 23:00).\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, there are 168 records (7 days * 24 hours). We have data for every hour? Let's count: \n    From 2017/2/21 0:00 to 2017/2/27 23:00: 7 days = 7*24 = 168 hours. So no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. We can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n 3. Given the short history, we can use a simple model. One common approach for electricity price forecasting is the Seasonal Naive method, where we use the same hour from the previous day (or same day of the week) as the forecast.\n\n    However, note that the data provided is from Tuesday (2017/2/21) to Monday (2017/2/27). The next day is Tuesday (2017/2/28). So we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday, 2017/2/21) as a naive forecast? But note that the pattern might change.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But we only have 7 days. We can try:\n\n    Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2017/2/21 for 2017/2/28) for each hour.\n\n    Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n 5. However, looking at the data, we see that the pattern on weekdays (Monday to Friday) might be different from weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Since 2017/2/28 is a Tuesday, we can use the average of the two Tuesdays we have? But we only have one Tuesday (2017/2/21) in the data. The other days are Wednesday to Monday.\n\n 6. Actually, we have:\n    - Tuesday: 2017/2/21 (day 1)\n    - Wednesday: 2017/2/22 (day 2)\n    - Thursday: 2017/2/23 (day 3)\n    - Friday: 2017/2/24 (day 4)\n    - Saturday: 2017/2/25 (day 5)\n    - Sunday: 2017/2/26 (day 6)\n    - Monday: 2017/2/27 (day 7)\n\n    The next day is Tuesday (2017/2/28). We have only one Tuesday in the history. So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But note that the last three weekdays are Friday (2017/2/24), Monday (2017/2/27) and ...? Actually, Monday is a weekday, but we don't have Thursday? We have:\n\n    Weekdays in the data: \n        Tuesday (2017/2/21), Wednesday (2017/2/22), Thursday (2017/2/23), Friday (2017/2/24), and Monday (2017/2/27) [since Saturday and Sunday are weekends].\n\n    So for the next Tuesday, we can use the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday and the Monday (which is the day before) and maybe the Friday? But that might not be consistent.\n\n 8. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the historical prices, a simple and common method is the Seasonal Naive with a seasonality of 24 hours. That is, we use the value from 24 hours ago as the forecast for the next hour? But that would be the same as using the same hour of the previous day. However, the pattern on a Tuesday might be more similar to the previous Tuesday than to the previous day (Monday).\n\n 9. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have one full Tuesday (2017/2/21) in the data, we can use that day as the forecast for the next Tuesday (2017/2/28). This is a naive seasonal forecast with a seasonality of 7 days.\n\n    So for 2017/2/28 0:00, we use the value from 2017/2/21 0:00 (which is 27.02)\n    for 2017/2/28 1:00, we use 2017/2/21 1:00 (26.22) and so on.\n\n 10. However, note that the data shows a general trend? Let's look at the last week:\n\n      The prices on 2017/2/27 (Monday) are generally higher than on 2017/2/21 (Tuesday). For example, at 0:00: 28.79 (Monday) vs 27.02 (Tuesday). So if we use the Tuesday from a week ago, we might be low.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can adjust by the recent trend. One way is to compute the average change from the previous week to the current week and adjust the forecast accordingly.\n\n     We can compute the average price for the last 7 days and the average price for the 7 days before that? But we only have 7 days. We don't have two full weeks.\n\n 12. We can compute the average of the same day of the week for the Monday we have (2017/2/27) and the Monday from the previous week? But we don't have the previous Monday (2017/2/20). We only have from 2017/2/21 to 2017/2/27.\n\n 13. Given the constraints, we might stick to the naive seasonal forecast of 7 days. But note that the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (which we have none in the history) and forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n 14. Another approach: use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, without a library and with only 168 points, we can do a simple average of the same hour over the available days? But we have only one Tuesday, one Wednesday, etc.\n\n 15. We can use the average of the same hour over the entire week? That is, for hour 0:00, we average the 0:00 of all 7 days? Then use that for the next Tuesday? But that would smooth out the weekday/weekend difference.\n\n 16. Considering the above, and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we choose the naive seasonal method with a seasonality of 7 days (i.e., using the same day of the previous week). This is a common baseline.\n\n 17. Therefore, we will use the values from 2017/2/21 (Tuesday) for the forecast of 2017/2/28 (Tuesday).\n\n 18. The forecast for 2017/2/28 0:00 is 27.02 (from 2017/2/21 0:00)\n      2017/2/28 1:00: 26.22\n      ... and so on until 2017/2/28 23:00: 27.58? But wait, the last hour of 2017/2/21 is 23:00 which is 29.85? Actually, the last hour of 2017/2/21 is 23:00: 29.85.\n\n 19. Let me list the forecast for 2017/2/28:\n\n      Hour 0:00 -> 27.02\n      Hour 1:00 -> 26.22\n      Hour 2:00 -> 25.91\n      Hour 3:00 -> 25.50\n      Hour 4:00 -> 26.27\n      Hour 5:00 -> 28.37\n      Hour 6:00 -> 30.35\n      Hour 7:00 -> 31.49\n      Hour 8:00 -> 31.57\n      Hour 9:00 -> 31.48\n      Hour 10:00 -> 31.29\n      Hour 11:00 -> 30.94\n      Hour 12:00 -> 30.74\n      Hour 13:00 -> 30.82\n      Hour 14:00 -> 30.77\n      Hour 15:00 -> 30.91\n      Hour 16:00 -> 31.57\n      Hour 17:00 -> 32.33\n      Hour 18:00 -> 32.89\n      Hour 19:00 -> 32.19\n      Hour 20:00 -> 31.78\n      Hour 21:00 -> 31.48\n      Hour 22:00 -> 30.74\n      Hour 23:00 -> 29.85\n\n 20. However, note that the data for 2017/2/27 (Monday) was generally higher than the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday. But we see that the prices on 2017/2/27 (Monday) are higher than on 2017/2/20 (which we don't have). So if there is an upward trend, this forecast might be low.\n\n 21. But without more data, we stick to the naive seasonal.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the day before (i.e., 24-hour seasonality) for the forecast? That would be using the values from 2017/2/27 for 2017/2/28.\n\n    Then the forecast for 2017/2/28 0:00 would be 28.79 (from 2017/2/27 0:00)\n    ... and for 23:00: 27.58.\n\n 23. Which is better? The problem says we are an expert. In practice, electricity prices exhibit both daily and weekly seasonality. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have a Tuesday from a week ago, and also the immediate day before is a Monday, we might combine them? For example, average the same hour from the previous Tuesday and the previous day (Monday).\n\n    So for each hour h on 2017/2/28, we do:\n        forecast = (value from 2017/2/21 at hour h + value from 2017/2/27 at hour h) / 2\n\n 24. Let me compare the two Tuesdays: 2017/2/21 and 2017/2/28? We don't have 2017/2/28. But we have the Monday (2017/2/27) and the Tuesday a week ago (2017/2/21). The Monday (2017/2/27) is the most recent day and might be more representative of the current level.\n\n 25. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last n days? We have 7 days. We can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? or 7 days? \n\n    If we use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days, then for 0:00:\n\n        (27.02, 28.56, 26.11, 28.26, 30.08, 28.54, 28.79) -> average = (27.02+28.56+26.11+28.26+30.08+28.54+28.79)/7 = ?\n\n        Let me compute: \n          27.02 + 28.56 = 55.58\n          55.58 + 26.11 = 81.69\n          81.69 + 28.26 = 109.95\n          109.95 + 30.08 = 140.03\n          140.03 + 28.54 = 168.57\n          168.57 + 28.79 = 197.36\n          197.36 / 7 = 28.1942857 -> approximately 28.19\n\n    Then for 1:00: (26.22, 26.86, 25.07, 27.27, 29.98, 27.86, 28.13) -> average = ?\n\n        26.22+26.86=53.08\n        53.08+25.07=78.15\n        78.15+27.27=105.42\n        105.42+29.98=135.40\n        135.40+27.86=163.26\n        163.26+28.13=191.39\n        191.39/7 = 27.34142857 -> 27.34\n\n    This would smooth the data and might be more robust.\n\n 26. However, note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns. For example, the 0:00 on Saturday (2017/2/25) was 30.08, which is higher than the weekdays? So including weekends in the average for a Tuesday might not be ideal.\n\n 27. We can use only the weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday and one Monday? We have:\n\n        Tuesday: 2017/2/21\n        Wednesday: 2017/2/22\n        Thursday: 2017/2/23\n        Friday: 2017/2/24\n        Monday: 2017/2/27   [note: Monday is the next weekday after Sunday and before Tuesday]\n\n    So for the coming Tuesday, we can use the average of the same hour on the available weekdays? That would be 5 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday.\n\n    For 0:00: (27.02, 28.56, 26.11, 28.26, 28.79) -> average = (27.02+28.56+26.11+28.26+28.79)/5 = \n        27.02+28.56=55.58\n        55.58+26.11=81.69\n        81.69+28.26=109.95\n        109.95+28.79=138.74\n        138.74/5 = 27.748\n\n    For 0:00: 27.75\n\n 28. This might be a better approach because it uses the weekdays and excludes weekends.\n\n 29. But note: the Monday we have (2017/2/27) is the day before the forecast day, so it might be the most relevant. We could give it more weight? But we are to do a simple forecast.\n\n 30. Given the above, I choose to use the average of the same hour over the last 5 weekdays (Tuesday 21st, Wednesday 22nd, Thursday 23rd, Friday 24th, and Monday 27th) for the forecast of Tuesday 28th.\n\n 31. Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n        Let h be the hour (0:00 as 0, 1:00 as 1, ... 23:00 as 23)\n        Let d0 = 2017/2/21 (Tuesday) at hour h\n        d1 = 2017/2/22 (Wednesday) at hour h\n        d2 = 2017/2/23 (Thursday) at hour h\n        d3 = 2017/2/24 (Friday) at hour h\n        d4 = 2017/2/27 (Monday) at hour h\n\n        forecast_h = (d0 + d1 + d2 + d3 + d4) / 5.0\n\n 32. We must compute this for each hour.\n\n 33. Let's do the first few hours:\n\n    Hour 0 (0:00): \n        d0 = 27.02 (21st)\n        d1 = 28.56 (22nd)\n        d2 = 26.11 (23rd)\n        d3 = 28.26 (24th)\n        d4 = 28.79 (27th)\n        sum = 27.02+28.56+26.11+28.26+28.79 = 138.74\n        avg = 138.74 / 5 = 27.748 -> round to 2 decimals: 27.75\n\n    Hour 1 (1:00):\n        d0 = 26.22\n        d1 = 26.86\n        d2 = 25.07\n        d3 = 27.27\n        d4 = 28.13\n        sum = 26.22+26.86+25.07+27.27+28.13 = 133.55\n        avg = 133.55 / 5 = 26.71\n\n    Hour 2 (2:00):\n        d0 = 25.91\n        d1 = 26.72\n        d2 = 24.48\n        d3 = 27.07\n        d4 = 27.82\n        sum = 25.91+26.72+24.48+27.07+27.82 = 132.00\n        avg = 132.00 / 5 = 26.40\n\n    Hour 3 (3:00):\n        d0 = 25.50\n        d1 = 26.66\n        d2 = 25.11\n        d3 = 27.24\n        d4 = 27.89\n        sum = 25.50+26.66+25.11+27.24+27.89 = 132.40\n        avg = 132.40 / 5 = 26.48\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n 34. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 35. However, note that the problem says we must give the complete forecast for the next 24 hours without omitting any values. So we have to compute 24 values.\n\n 36. We'll compute the average for each hour from 0 to 23 using the 5 weekdays.\n\n 37.

We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 42. This method uses the same hour from the five weekdays (excluding the weekend days) and averages them. It is a reasonable approach for a short-term forecast when we have one week of data.\n\n 43. Note: The problem did not provide any other features (like grid load or wind power) so we cannot use them.\n\n 44. We assume that the pattern of the weekday is similar and the average will smooth out random fluctuations.\n\n 45. We output the forecast.\n\n Let me double-check a few:\n\n    hour0: \n        27.02, 28.56, 26.11, 28.26, 28.79 -> \n        27.02+28.56=55.58\n        55.58+26.11=81.69\n        81.69+28.26=109.95\n        109.95+28.79=138.74 -> 138.74/5=27.748 -> 27.75 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n    hour23:\n        29.85, 26.38, 27.82, 30.46, 27.58 -> \n        29.85+26.38=56.23\n        56.23+27.82=84.05\n        84.05+30.46=114.51\n        114.51+27.58=142.09 -> 142.09/5=28.418 -> 28.42\n\n 46.
