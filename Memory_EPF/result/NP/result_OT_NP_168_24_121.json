        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/4/28 0:00 to 2015/5/4 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/5/5 0:00 to 2015/5/5 23:00.\n\n However, note that the data provided ends at 2015/5/4 23:00. The next 24 hours would be the entire day of May 5, 2015.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have to handle missing values, we first check for missing values in the provided data.\n\n Looking at the data, we have 168 records (7 days * 24 hours = 168). The data seems complete? Let me count:\n\n  From 2015/4/28 0:00 to 2015/5/4 23:00: \n    7 days = 7 * 24 = 168 hours. So no missing values in the provided historical set.\n\n Approach:\n\n We are not provided with the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts, only the observed prices (OT). Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, for a 24-hour forecast, we can use a model that captures the daily pattern.\n\n Since we are to provide a forecast without any complex modeling tools, we can use a simple method such as:\n\n  Option 1: Seasonal Naive - using the same hour from the previous day or same day of the previous week.\n\n  However, note that the last day (2015/5/4) is a Monday. The next day is Tuesday (2015/5/5). We can look at the previous Tuesday? But our data only goes back 7 days, so the previous Tuesday was 2015/4/28.\n\n  But note: 2015/4/28 was a Tuesday? Let me check: \n  2015/4/28: Tuesday (if 2015/5/4 is Monday, then 2015/4/28 is the same day of the week? Actually, 2015/5/4 is Monday, then 2015/4/28 is 6 days before, which is a Tuesday? Wait, let's count backwards:\n\n  2015/5/4: Monday\n  2015/5/3: Sunday\n  2015/5/2: Saturday\n  2015/5/1: Friday\n  2015/4/30: Thursday\n  2015/4/29: Wednesday\n  2015/4/28: Tuesday\n\n  So the next day (2015/5/5) is a Tuesday. We can use the previous Tuesday (2015/4/28) as a naive forecast? But note that the pattern might change due to other factors.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last few Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n  Option 2: Use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days? But that would include different days of the week.\n\n  Option 3: Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) with daily seasonality. But we cannot implement that without tools.\n\n  Given the constraints, a simple approach is to use the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2015/5/4) for the forecast of Tuesday? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the same day of the previous week (i.e., the Tuesday of last week: 2015/4/28) and then adjust by the trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n  Considering the data, we see that the prices on 2015/5/4 (Monday) are generally higher than on 2015/4/28 (Tuesday). So a direct use of 2015/4/28 might be too low.\n\n  Another idea: use the average of the last 7 days for each hour? That would smooth out the daily variations and might be more robust.\n\n  Let me compute the average for each hour of the day over the last 7 days:\n\n  We have 7 days: 2015/4/28 (Tue) to 2015/5/4 (Mon). For each hour (0 to 23), we average the 7 values.\n\n  However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's look at the same hour (e.g., 7:00) over the week:\n\n  2015/4/28 7:00: 43.84\n  2015/4/29 7:00: 31.08\n  2015/4/30 7:00: 31.94\n  2015/5/1 7:00: 24.06\n  2015/5/2 7:00: 23.87\n  2015/5/3 7:00: 23.60\n  2015/5/4 7:00: 28.53\n\n  The average for 7:00: (43.84+31.08+31.94+24.06+23.87+23.60+28.53)/7 = 29.56\n\n  But if we look at the same hour on the previous Tuesday (43.84) and the current Monday (28.53), they are quite different.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? For example, the average of the last 3 days for that hour? \n\n  Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday in the data (a week ago) and also the Monday (yesterday) and Sunday, etc., we might want to use:\n\n  - The same hour from the previous day (Monday) and the same hour from the same day last week (Tuesday) and then take an average? \n\n  But without a clear model, we have to choose a simple method.\n\n  Considering the instructions and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, I propose:\n\n  Use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are: 2015/5/2, 2015/5/3, 2015/5/4) for the forecast of 2015/5/5.\n\n  Why 3 days? Because it captures the most recent pattern and includes a weekend and a Monday. The next day is a weekday (Tuesday) and the last 3 days include Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.\n\n  However, note that 2015/5/2 (Saturday) and 2015/5/3 (Sunday) are weekends, and 2015/5/4 is a Monday. The next day is Tuesday, which is a weekday. So we might want to use only weekdays? But we don't have a Tuesday in the last 3 days.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the same day of the previous week (2015/4/28) and the last two days (2015/5/3 and 2015/5/4) and average? But that might not be consistent.\n\n  Given the complexity and without more information, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This is a simple and common approach for short-term forecasting with daily seasonality.\n\n  Steps:\n\n  For each hour h in [0,23]:\n      forecast_h = (price_{day1, h} + price_{day2, h} + ... + price_{day7, h}) / 7\n\n  where day1 is 2015/4/28 (Tuesday), day2 is 2015/4/29 (Wednesday), ... day7 is 2015/5/4 (Monday).\n\n  This will give a forecast that smooths out the daily variations and is robust to outliers.\n\n  Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n  We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the 7 values.\n\n  We have the data in chronological order. We can group by the hour of the day.\n\n  Example for hour 0:00:\n\n     2015/4/28 0:00: 24.80\n     2015/4/29 0:00: 24.48\n     2015/4/30 0:00: 24.07\n     2015/5/1 0:00: 24.77\n     2015/5/2 0:00: 24.12\n     2015/5/3 0:00: 24.51\n     2015/5/4 0:00: 23.22\n\n     Average = (24.80+24.48+24.07+24.77+24.12+24.51+23.22)/7 = 24.2814\n\n  Similarly, we do for each hour.\n\n  However, note that the data for 2015/5/4 (Monday) might be more relevant than a week ago. But without a more sophisticated model, we use the 7-day average.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? For example, linear weights: [1,1,1,2,2,2,3] for the last 7 days (with the last day having weight 3, the day before weight 2, and the first three days weight 1). But that is arbitrary.\n\n  Since the problem does not specify the method, I choose the simple 7.\n\n  But note: the data shows a drop in prices on the weekend and then a rise on Monday. The next day might be similar to the previous Tuesday? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n  Considering the trade-off, I will use the 7-day average as a baseline.\n\n  Let me compute the 24 averages:\n\n  We'll create an array for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the average.\n\n  We can write a small program in our mind:\n\n  Hour 0: [24.80, 24.48, 24.07, 24.77, 24.12, 24.51, 23.22] -> 24.2814\n  Hour 1: [24.48, 24.07, 23.73, 24.21, 23.06, 24.05, 23.00] -> (24.48+24.07+23.73+24.21+23.06+24.05+23.00)/7 = 23.8\n\n  But let me calculate:\n\n  24.48+24.07=48.55\n  +23.73=72.28\n  +24.21=96.49\n  +23.06=119.55\n  +24.05=143.60\n  +23.00=166.60\n  166.60/7 = 23.8\n\n  Hour 2: [24.51, 23.97, 23.66, 24.01, 21.91, 23.70, 22.85] -> \n  24.51+23.97=48.48\n  +23.66=72.14\n  +24.01=96.15\n  +21.91=118.06\n  +23.70=141.76\n  +22.85=164.61\n  164.61/7 = 23.5157\n\n  We can do this for all 24 hours.\n\n  However, note that the problem requires 24 forecasted values for 2015/5/5 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n  We'll compute the average for each hour and then round to two decimals (as the input data).\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the median? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n  Given the time, we'll compute the 7-day average for each hour.\n\n  Let me do the calculations:\n\n  Hour 0: (24.80, 24.48, 24.07, 24.77, 24.12, 24.51, 23.22) ->

But without a clear method, we stick to the simple average.\n\n  Alternatively, we could use the median? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n  Given the instructions, we provide the 7-day average.\n\n  Let me write the forecast in the required format.\n\n  The next 24 hours are for 2015/5/5 0:00 to 2015/5/5 23:00.\n\n  We output:\n\n  2015/5/5 0:00 24.28\n  2015/5/5 1:00 23.80\n  2015/5/5 2:00 23.52\n  2015/5/5 3:00 23.40\n  2015/5/5 4:00 23.58\n  2015/5/5 5:00 24.13\n  2015/5/5 6:00 25.12\n  2015/5/5 7:00 29.56\n  2015/5/5 8:00 31.44\n  2015/5/5 9:00 30.45\n  2015/5/5 10:00 28.75\n  2015/5/5 11:00 27.77\n  2015/5/5 12:00 26.87\n  2015/5/5 13:00 26.46\n  2015/5/5 14:00 25.94\n  2015/5/5 15:00 25.74\n  2015/5/5 16:00 25.60\n  2015/5/5 17:00 25.80\n  2015/5/5 18:00 25.95\n  2015/5/5 19:00 26.24\n  2015/5/5 20:00 26.53\n  2015/5/5 21:00 26.65\n  2015/5/5 22:00 25.71\n  2015/5/5 23:00 24.86\n\n  We output in the same format as the input, but only the next 24 hours.\n\n  Note: The input had the date format as \"YYYY/M/D H:MM\", but we see that the day and month are without leading zeros. We follow the same.\n\n  However, note that 2015/5/5 is the date.\n\n  We write the answer in the required XML-like tags.\n\n  Important: The problem says \"do not skip or summarize any values\", so we list all 24.\n\n  Let's write the answer.\n",
