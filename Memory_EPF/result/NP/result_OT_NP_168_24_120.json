        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/4/21 0:00 to 2015/4/27 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2015/4/28 0:00 to 2015/4/28 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, we have 168 consecutive hourly records. There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Since we are only given the price, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the clear daily seasonality (as seen by the pattern repeating every 24 hours), we can use a seasonal model or a simple averaging by hour of the day.\n\n Approach:\n We note that the data shows:\n   - Daily patterns: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Also, we can see that the weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices than the weekend.\n\n The last day in the data is 2015/4/27 (Monday). The next 24 hours are for 2015/4/28 (Tuesday). We can use the historical patterns of the same hour from previous days, especially the same day of the week.\n\n However, note that the data only covers 7 days (from 2015/4/21 to 2015/4/27). We can use:\n\n   - The same hour from the previous Monday (2015/4/20 is not provided, so we don't have a full week before) -> we only have one Monday (2015/4/27) and one Tuesday (2015/4/21) in the data.\n\n Since we have only one week of data, we can consider:\n\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour for the past 7 days? But we have only 7 days, but note that 2015/4/21 is Tuesday and 2015/4/28 is also Tuesday. So we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2015/4/21) and also consider the most recent days.\n\n   However, the data shows a spike on Monday (2015/4/27) which is unusual. So we must be cautious.\n\n   Option 2: Use a weighted average where more recent days are given more weight.\n\n   Option 3: Since the data is limited, we can use a simple method: for each hour of the day (0 to 23) we take the average of that hour over the available days. But note that the weekdays and weekends are different.\n\n   We have:\n        Tuesday: 2015/4/21\n        Wednesday: 2015/4/22\n        Thursday: 2015/4/23\n        Friday: 2015/4/24\n        Saturday: 2015/4/25\n        Sunday: 2015/4/26\n        Monday: 2015/4/27\n\n   The next day is Tuesday (2015/4/28). We can use the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2015/4/21) and the Monday (2015/4/27) might be too recent and different? But note that Monday was a spike day.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for all the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and Monday? But the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) are different.\n\n   Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n        - The previous Tuesday (2015/4/21) and the same hour from the Monday (2015/4/27) and also the Wednesday (2015/4/22) and Thursday (2015/4/23) and Friday (2015/4/24) as they are weekdays? But note that the Monday was a holiday? or a spike? We don't have context.\n\n   However, the spike on Monday (2015/4/27) is very high. It might be an anomaly. So we might not want to rely too much on that.\n\n   Proposed method:\n        For each hour h (0 to 23) of the next day (Tuesday), we take the average of the same hour h from:\n            - The previous Tuesday (2015/4/21)\n            - The previous Wednesday (2015/4/22)\n            - The previous Thursday (2015/4/23)\n            - The previous Friday (2015/4/24)\n\n        We skip the weekend and the Monday because Monday was an outlier? But note that the problem does not specify holidays. However, we see that Monday (2015/4/27) had unusually high prices (e.g. 45.27 at 8:00) compared to the previous days.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a median to avoid the effect of the Monday spike? But we only have one Monday.\n\n        Since we are limited by data, and we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n\n          - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2015/4/21) and the same hour from the Monday (2015/4/27) but with a dampening factor? \n\n        However, without more data, a simple and robust method is to use the average of the same hour for the last 4 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and then adjust for the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n        Let's look at the data: \n          Tuesday (2015/4/21): prices in the 20s, with peak around 27.55\n          Wednesday (2015/4/22): similar, peak 27.47\n          Thursday (2015/4/23): lower, peak 25.05\n          Friday (2015/4/24): peak 29.46\n          Monday (2015/4/27): very high peak 45.27\n\n        The Monday spike is unusual. It might be due to a specific event. Since we don't have information about the cause, and we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the Tuesday from the previous week and the Friday (which is the last weekday before the weekend) and then the Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n        We decide to use the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2015/4/21) and the Friday (2015/4/24) and the Wednesday (2015/4/22) and Thursday (2015/4/23). But note that Thursday was lower.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the median of the same hour for the last 4 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) to avoid the effect of the Monday spike and also to be robust to outliers.\n\n        However, we are only 4 days. The median for 4 values is the average of the two middle ones.\n\n        Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n          - Collect the prices for hour h from 2015/4/21 (Tue), 2015/4/22 (Wed), 2015/4/23 (Thu), 2015/4/24 (Fri).\n          - Sort these four values.\n          - Take the average of the second and third (median for even number of observations).\n\n        Why not include Monday? Because Monday is the day before and it was an outlier, and we are forecasting a Tuesday which is a weekday but we don't know if the event that caused the Monday spike will continue. Without more information, it's safer to exclude.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"some data may contain missing values\", but in this provided data there are none. So we have 4 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) for the same hour.\n\n        However, we note that the weekend (Sat, Sun) are different and we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday). So we don't use the weekend.\n\n        Also, we don't use the Monday (2015/4/27) because it is an outlier and we don't know if the same conditions will prevail.\n\n        But what if the spike is due to a new trend? We have no way of knowing. With limited data, we stick to the median of the last four weekdays (excluding the weekend and the Monday).\n\n        However, note that the Monday is the most recent day. We might want to include it but with a lower weight? But we don't have a clear method.\n\n        Given the instructions and the data, I choose the median of the four weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) for each hour.\n\n        Let's calculate for each hour:\n\n        Example for hour 0:00 (the first hour of the day):\n          Tue (4/21): 23.12\n          Wed (4/22): 21.93\n          Thu (4/23): 18.99\n          Fri (4/24): 22.65\n\n          Sorted: [18.99, 21.93, 22.65, 23.12] -> median = (21.93+22.65)/2 = 22.29\n\n        But note: the last day (Monday 4/27) at 0:00 was 24.28, which is higher. But we are excluding it.\n\n        We do this for every hour.\n\n        However, we must also consider the possibility of a trend? The data from Tuesday to Friday (4/21 to 4/24) does not a clear trend, but we see a drop on Thursday and then a rise on Friday.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the Friday (the closest weekday) and less to the Tuesday? But the median is robust.\n\n        Let's proceed with the median.\n\n        We'll compute for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n        But note: the data for the same hour (23:00) of the previous weekdays:\n          Tue: 23.86\n          Wed: 22.89\n          Thu: 23.19\n          Fri: 23.30\n          Sorted: [22.89, 23.19, 23.30, 23.86] -> median = (23.19+23.30)/2 = 23.245\n\n        So the forecast for 2015/4/28 0:00: 22.29\n        and for 2015/4/28 23:00: 23.245\n\n        However, we must note that the Monday (4/27) had a spike and then a drop at the end. But we are excluding it.\n\n        But what if the spike on Monday is a one-time event? Then our method is safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days, but then the weekend and the Monday spike would affect. We don't want the weekend to lower the average for a weekday, and the Monday spike might be an outlier.\n\n        Therefore, the median of the four weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) is a reasonable choice.\n\n        We'll compute the median for each hour and output the 24 values.\n\n        The dates for the forecast are:\n          2015/4/28 0:00 to 2015/4/28 23:00\n\n        Let's compute:\n\n        Hour 0: [23.12, 21.93, 18.99, 22.65] -> sorted: [18.99, 21.93, 22.65, 23.12] -> median = (21.93+22.65)/2 = 22.29\n        Hour 1: [22.35, 21.09, 16.04, 22.43] -> sorted: [16.04, 21.09, 22.35, 22.43] -> median = (21.09+22.35)/2 = 21.72\n        Hour 2: [22.20, 21.29, 14.67, 22.55] -> sorted: [14.67, 21.29, 22.20, 22.55] -> median = (21.29+22.20)/2 = 21.745\n        Hour 3: [22.37, 21.92, 14.68, 22.95] -> sorted: [14.68, 21.92, 22.37, 22.95] -> median = (21.92+22.37)/2 = 22.145\n        Hour 4: [22.74, 22.64, 15.84, 23.53] -> sorted: [15.84, 22.64, 22.74, 23.53] -> median = (22.64+22.74)/2 = 22.69\n        Hour 5: [23.52, 23.53, 19.96, 24.16] -> sorted: [19.96, 23.52, 23.53, 24.16] -> median = (23.52+23.53)/2 = 23.525\n        Hour 6: [25.19, 25.02, 23.46, 25.16] -> sorted: [23.46, 25.02, 25.16, 25.19] -> median = (25.02+25.16)/2 = 25.09\n        Hour 7: [27.02, 26.42, 24.78, 28.61] -> sorted: [24.78, 26.42, 27.02, 28.61] -> median = (26.42+27.02)/2 = 26.72\n        Hour 8: [27.55, 27.47, 25.05, 29.46] -> sorted: [25.05, 27.47, 27.55, 29.46] -> median = (27.47+27.55)/2 = 27.51\n        Hour 9: [27.40, 27.15, 24.99, 28.78] -> sorted: [24.99, 27.15, 27.40, 28.78] -> median = (27.15+27.40)/2 = 27.275\n        Hour 10: [27.21, 26.91, 24.86, 28.20] -> sorted: [24.86, 26.91, 27.21, 28.20] -> median = (26.91+27.21)/2 = 27.06\n        Hour 11: [26.87, 25.96, 24.54, 26.80] -> sorted: [24.54, 25.96, 26.80, 26.87] -> median = (25.96+26.80)/2 = 26.38\n        Hour 12: [26.11, 25.55, 24.37, 25.85] -> sorted: [24.37, 25.55, 25.85, 26.11] -> median = (25.55+25.85)/2 = 25.70\n        Hour 13: [25.81, 25.49, 24.16, 25.19] -> sorted: [24.16, 25.19, 25.49, 25.81] -> median = (25.19+25.49)/2 = 25.34\n        Hour 14: [25.44, 25.29, 23.86, 24.79] -> sorted: [23.86, 24.79, 25.29, 25.44] -> median = (24.79+25.29)/2 = 25.04\n        Hour 15: [25.24, 25.21, 23.81, 24.39] -> sorted: [23.81, 24.39, 25.21, 25.24] -> median = (24.39+25.21)/2 = 24.80\n        Hour 16: [25.02, 25.06, 23.56, 24.12] -> sorted: [23.56, 24.12, 25.02, 25.06] -> median = (24.12+25.02)/2 = 24.57\n        Hour 17: [25.21, 25.06, 23.66, 24.23] -> sorted: [23.66, 24.23, 25.06, 25.21] -> median = (24.23+25.06)/2 = 24.645\n        Hour 18: [25.18, 24.96, 23.66, 24.37] -> sorted: [23.66, 24.37, 24.96, 25.18] -> median = (24.37+24.96)/2 = 24.665\n        Hour 19: [25.13, 24.88, 23.82, 24.26] -> sorted: [23.82, 24.26, 24.88, 25.13] -> median = (24.26+24.88)/2 = 24.57\n        Hour 20: [25.29, 24.86, 24.15, 24.51] -> sorted: [24.15, 24.51, 24.86, 25.29] -> median = (24.51+24.86)/2 = 24.685\n        Hour 21: [25.26, 24.86, 24.55, 24.40] -> sorted: [24.40, 24.55, 24.86, 25.26] -> median = (24.55+24.86)/2 = 24.705\n        Hour 22: [24.56, 23.95, 24.03, 23.71] -> sorted: [23.71, 23.95, 24.03, 24.56] -> median = (23.95+24.03)/2 = 23.99\n        Hour 23: [23.86, 22.89, 23.19, 23.30] -> sorted: [22.89, 23.19, 23.30, 23.86] -> median = (23.19+23.30)/2 = 23.245\n\n        Therefore, the forecast for 2015/4/28:\n\n          0:00: 22.29\n          1:00: 21.72\n          2:00: 21.745\n          3:00: 22.145\n          4:00: 22.69\n          5:00: 23.525\n          6:00: 25.09\n          7:00: 26.72\n          8:00: 27.51\n          9:00: 27.275\n          10:00: 27.06\n          11:00: 26.38\n          12:00: 25.70\n          13:00: 25.34\n          14:00: 25.04\n          15:00: 24.80\n          16:00: 24.57\n          17:00: 24.645\n          18:00: 24.665\n          19:00: 24.57\n          20:00: 24.685\n          21:00: 24.705\n          22:00: 23.99\n          23:00: 23.245\n\n        We output with two decimal places as in the input.\n\n        However, note that the input data has two decimal places, but we have computed with more. We round to two decimal places.\n\n        But note: the median we computed might have more than two decimal places. We'll round to two.\n\n        Alternatively, we can keep the two decimal places as in the original data. But the original data has two.\n\n        Let me recast the medians to two decimal places:\n\n          0:00: 22.29 -> 22.29\n          1:00: 21.72 -> 21.72\n          2:00: 21.745 -> 21.75 (rounded: 21.745 is 21.75 when rounded to two decimals)\n          21.745: rounding: look at the third decimal is 5 -> round up -> 21.75\n\n        We'll round to two decimal places.\n\n        So:\n\n          0:00: 22.29\n          1:00: 21.72\n          2:00: 21.75\n          3:00: 22.15 (22.145 -> 22.15)\n          4:00: 22.69\n          5:00: 23.53 (23.525 -> 23.53)\n          6:00: 25.09\n          7:00: 26.72\n          8:00: 27.51\n          9:00: 27.28 (27.275 -> 27.28)\n          10:00: 27.06\n          11:00: 26.38\n          12:00: 25.70\n          13:00: 25.34\n          14:00: 25.04\n          15:00: 24.80\n          16:00: 24.57\n          17:00: 24.65 (24.645 -> 24.65)\n          18:00: 24.67 (24.665 -> 24.67)\n          19:00: 24.57\n          20:00: 24.69 (24.685 -> 24.69)\n          21:00: 24.71 (24.705 -> 24.71)\n          22:00: 23.99\n          23:00: 23.25 (23.245 -> 23.25)\n\n        But note: the original data had two decimal places and we are rounding to two.\n\n        However, the problem says \"handle missing values carefully\", but there are none. So we are good.\n\n        We output the forecast for the next 24 hours in the required format.\n\n        Format:\n\n        <answer>\n\n        2015/4/28 0:00 22.29\n        2015/4/28 1:00 21.72\n        2015/4/28 2:00 21.75\n        2015/4/28 3:00 22.15\n        2015/4/28 4:00 22.69\n        2015/4/28 5:00 23.53\n        2015/4/28 6:00 25.09\n        2015/4/28 7:00 26.72\n        2015/4/28 8:00 27.51\n        2015/4/28 9:00 27.28\n        2015/4/28 10:00 27.06\n        2015/4/28 11:00 26.38\n        2015/4/28 12:00 25.70\n        2015/4/28 13:00 25.34\n        2015/4/28 14:00 25.04\n        2015/4/28 15:00 24.80\n        2015/4/28 16:00 24.57\n        2015/4/28 17:00 24.65\n        2015/4/28 18:00 24.67\n        2015/4/28 19:00 24.57\n        2015/4/28 20:00 24.69\n        2015/4/28 21:00 24.71\n        2015/4/28 22:00 23.99\n        2015/4/28 23:00 23.25\n\n        </answer>\n\n        However, note that the input data had the format with a space after the date and then the time without a space? Actually, the input has:\n\n          \"2015/4/21 0:00\" -> so the time is written as \"0:00\", not \"00:00\". We'll use the same format.\n\n        We output exactly 24 lines.\n\n        This is a simple method. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, etc.) but given the constraints (only 7 days of data and only price) we use this robust method.\n\n        We are aware that the Monday spike is not included, but without knowing the cause, we avoid it.\n\n        Let's output.\n",
