        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013/6/4 0:00 to 2013/6/10 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2013/6/11 0:00 to 2013/6/11 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we note that the data is given in chronological order and there are no gaps in the dates and times.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, the data only covers 7 days, so we can capture daily patterns but weekly patterns might be harder.\n\n 4. We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: Seasonal Naive method (using the same hour from the previous day) or a more sophisticated method like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA. However, without the ability to fit a model in the traditional sense (as we are an AI and cannot run code here), we must use a heuristic.\n\n 5. Considering the context, we note that the problem is about short-term forecasting and the data shows a clear daily pattern. We can use the average of the same hour from the past 7 days to forecast the next day. Alternatively, we can use the last day (2013/6/10) as a base and adjust by the trend of the last few days? But note: the last day (2013/6/10) is a Monday? Actually, 2013/6/4 is a Tuesday? We have 7 days: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (Tuesday to Monday). The next day is 2013/6/11, a Tuesday.\n\n 6. Since the pattern on weekdays might be different from weekends, we can consider:\n    - For the next day (Tuesday) we can use the previous Tuesday (2013/6/4) and the same day from the week before? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three weekdays? But note: \n    - 2013/6/4 (Tuesday), 2013/6/5 (Wednesday), 2013/6/6 (Thursday), 2013/6/7 (Friday) are weekdays.\n    - 2013/6/8 (Saturday), 2013/6/9 (Sunday) are weekend.\n    - 2013/6/10 (weekday: Monday)\n\n 8. The next day (2013/6/11) is a Tuesday. So we can use the average of the previous Tuesday (2013/6/4) and the Monday (2013/6/10) and maybe the Wednesday (2013/6/5) and Thursday (2013/6/6) and Friday (2013/6/7) to form a weekday pattern? But note that the pattern on Monday might be different from Tuesday.\n\n 9. However, we only have one Tuesday. So we can do:\n    Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (2013/6/4) as the forecast for 2013/6/11? But that might not capture recent trends.\n\n    Option 2: Compute the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include weekend days which are different.\n\n    Option 3: Use the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the last week? That is, average of Tuesday (4th), Wednesday (5th), Thursday (6th), Friday (7th), and Monday (10th) for each hour.\n\n 10. Let's do Option 3: For each hour h (0 to 23), we take the prices at hour h from the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) and average them.\n\n 11. But note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are different. We are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday). So we exclude the weekend days.\n\n 12. How many weekdays? We have 5 weekdays: \n      Tuesday (2013-06-04)\n      Wednesday (2013-06-05)\n      Thursday (2013-06-06)\n      Friday (2013-06-07)\n      Monday (2013-06-10)\n\n 13. For each hour (0 to 23) of the next day (Tuesday 2013-06-11), we compute:\n      forecast_hour = (price_hour of 2013-06-04 + 2013-06-05 + 2013-06-06 + 2013-06-07 + 2013-06-10) / 5\n\n 14. However, we must check if there is a trend? The data from the last day (Monday 2013-06-10) is generally higher than the previous Tuesday (2013-06-04). So we might adjust by the recent trend? But without a model, we stick to the average.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? For example, linear weights: [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3] for the days in order (oldest to most recent: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday). But this is arbitrary.\n\n 16. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are not running a model, we will use the simple average of the 5 weekdays for each hour.\n\n 17. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n      Hour 0: (32.81 + 35.93 + 37.76 + 38.51 + 36.31) / 5 = (32.81+35.93=68.74; 68.74+37.76=106.5; 106.5+38.51=145.01; 145.01+36.31=181.32) -> 181.32/5 = 36.264\n      Hour 1: (32.00 + 35.28 + 36.94 + 37.76 + 33.44) / 5 = (32.00+35.28=67.28; 67.28+36.94=104.22; 104.22+37.76=141.98; 141.98+33.44=175.42) -> 175.42/5 = 35.084\n      ... and so on.\n\n 18. But note: the last day (Monday) has a different pattern? And we are forecasting a Tuesday. However, without more Tuesdays, we use the average of the weekdays.\n\n 19. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 20. However, we must note that the data for the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) are not included. This should be okay because we are forecasting a weekday.\n\n 21. Let's compute the averages for each hour:\n\n      We'll list the 5 weekdays for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: [32.81 (Tue), 35.93 (Wed), 37.76 (Thu), 38.51 (Fri), 36.31 (Mon)] -> 32.81+35.93+37.76+38.51+36.31 = 181.32 -> 181.32/5 = 36.264\n        Hour 1: [32.00, 35.28, 36.94, 37.76, 33.44] = 32.00+35.28=67.28; 67.28+36.94=104.22; 104.22+37.76=141.98; 141.98+33.44=175.42 -> 35.084\n        Hour 2: [30.35, 34.46, 35.73, 37.08, 32.15] = 30.35+34.46=64.81; 64.81+35.73=100.54; 100.54+37.08=137.62; 137.62+32.15=169.77 -> 169.77/5 = 33.954\n        Hour 3: [29.74, 34.17, 35.47, 36.38, 32.01] = 29.74+34.17=63.91; 63.91+35.47=99.38; 99.38+36.38=135.76; 135.76+32.01=167.77 -> 167.77/5 = 33.554\n        Hour 4: [30.09, 34.21, 35.96, 37.23, 32.07] = 30.09+34.21=64.3; 64.3+35.96=100.26; 100.26+37.23=137.49; 137.49+32.07=169.56 -> 169.56/5 = 33.912\n        Hour 5: [32.77, 36.34, 38.07, 38.37, 36.77] = 32.77+36.34=69.11; 69.11+38.07=107.18; 107.18+38.37=145.55; 145.55+36.77=182.32 -> 182.32/5 = 36.464\n        Hour 6: [38.53, 40.16, 39.95, 40.19, 39.20] = 38.53+40.16=78.69; 78.69+39.95=118.64; 118.64+40.19=158.83; 158.83+39.20=198.03 -> 198.03/5 = 39.606\n        Hour 7: [41.49, 44.58, 45.04, 44.63, 41.93] = 41.49+44.58=86.07; 86.07+45.04=131.11; 131.11+44.63=175.74; 175.74+41.93=217.67 -> 217.67/5 = 43.534\n        Hour 8: [44.49, 49.99, 45.23, 46.04, 45.31] = 44.49+49.99=94.48; 94.48+45.23=139.71; 139.71+46.04=185.75; 185.75+45.31=231.06 -> 231.06/5 = 46.212\n        Hour 9: [44.10, 46.76, 43.37, 44.65, 45.27] = 44.10+46.76=90.86; 90.86+43.37=134.23; 134.23+44.65=178.88; 178.88+45.27=224.15 -> 224.15/5 = 44.83\n        Hour 10: [44.76, 43.93, 44.74, 43.56, 45.62] = 44.76+43.93=88.69; 88.69+44.74=133.43; 133.43+43.56=176.99; 176.99+45.62=222.61 -> 222.61/5 = 44.522\n        Hour 11: [44.04, 42.85, 44.89, 43.12, 45.08] = 44.04+42.85=86.89; 86.89+44.89=131.78; 131.78+43.12=174.90; 174.90+45.08=219.98 -> 219.98/5 = 43.996\n        Hour 12: [42.98, 42.55, 43.51, 42.15, 43.87] = 42.98+42.55=85.53; 85.53+43.51=129.04; 129.04+42.15=171.19; 171.19+43.87=215.06 -> 215.06/5 = 43.012\n        Hour 13: [42.66, 42.03, 42.85, 41.31, 43.67] = 42.66+42.03=84.69; 84.69+42.85=127.54; 127.54+41.31=168.85; 168.85+43.67=212.52 -> 212.52/5 = 42.504\n        Hour 14: [41.03, 40.30, 40.92, 39.93, 41.97] = 41.03+40.30=81.33; 81.33+40.92=122.25; 122.25+39.93=162.18; 162.18+41.97=204.15 -> 204.15/5 = 40.83\n        Hour 15: [40.86, 39.63, 40.27, 39.36, 41.08] = 40.86+39.63=80.49; 80.49+40.27=120.76; 120.76+39.36=160.12; 160.12+41.08=201.20 -> 201.20/5 = 40.24\n        Hour 16: [39.77, 39.20, 39.74, 39.09, 40.97] = 39.77+39.20=78.97; 78.97+39.74=118.71; 118.71+39.09=157.80; 157.80+40.97=198.77 -> 198.77/5 = 39.754\n        Hour 17: [39.77, 39.01, 39.73, 39.01, 40.83] = 39.77+39.01=78.78; 78.78+39.73=118.51; 118.51+39.01=157.52; 157.52+40.83=198.35 -> 198.35/5 = 39.67\n        Hour 18: [40.19, 40.24, 40.29, 38.92, 40.81] = 40.19+40.24=80.43; 80.43+40.29=120.72; 120.72+38.92=159.64; 159.64+40.81=200.45 -> 200.45/5 = 40.09\n        Hour 19: [40.94, 40.64, 40.37, 38.98, 40.74] = 40.94+40.64=81.58; 81.58+40.37=121.95; 121.95+38.98=160.93; 160.93+40.74=201.67 -> 201.67/5 = 40.334\n        Hour 20: [40.96, 39.69, 40.36, 38.84, 40.46] = 40.96+39.69=80.65; 80.65+40.36=121.01; 121.01+38.84=159.85; 159.85+40.46=200.31 -> 200.31/5 = 40.062\n        Hour 21: [39.95, 39.77, 39.66, 38.17, 40.35] = 39.95+39.77=79.72; 79.72+39.66=119.38; 119.38+38.17=157.55; 157.55+40.35=197.90 -> 197.90/5 = 39.58\n        Hour 22: [39.82, 38.14, 39.24, 37.90, 40.31] = 39.82+38.14=77.96; 77.96+39.24=117.20; 117.20+37.90=155.10; 155.10+40.31=195.41 -> 195.41/5 = 39.082\n        Hour 23: [36.51, 36.48, 38.04, 36.06, 38.95] = 36.51+36.48=72.99; 72.99+38.04=111.03; 111.03+36.06=147.09; 147.09+38.95=186.04 -> 186.04/5 = 37.208\n\n 22.

We write the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple average method. In practice, more sophisticated models (like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) would be used, but given the constraints, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n Let's output the forecast.\n",
