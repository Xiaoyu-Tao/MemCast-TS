        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016-12-06 00:00 to 2016-12-12 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-12-13 00:00 to 2016-12-13 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and the dataset also includes grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, note that we are only provided with the historical electricity prices (OT) and not the other features. Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, there are 168 records (7 days * 24 hours). We can see that the data is complete (no missing values in the provided excerpt). So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the nature of electricity prices (strong daily and weekly seasonality), we can use a time series model that captures:\n    - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n    - Weekly seasonality (168 hours)\n\n 3. Given the constraints of this environment, we cannot run complex models. However, we can use a simple but effective method: \n    - We can use the average of the same hours from the previous days (e.g., average of the last 7 days at 00:00 for forecasting 00:00 of the next day) but adjusted for recent trends.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the data shows a clear daily pattern and also a weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n 5. Since the data includes both weekdays and weekends, and the next day (2016-12-13) is a Tuesday (as 2016-12-12 is Monday), we can consider the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2016-12-06) and also the recent days (Monday, 2016-12-12 and the days before).\n\n 6. Approach: We will use a weighted average of the same hour from:\n    - The same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) with a high weight because of weekly seasonality.\n    - The same hour from the day before (i.e., 1 day ago) with a medium weight.\n    - The same hour from two days ago (i.e., 2 days ago) with a lower weight.\n\n    Weights: 0.5 for 7 days ago, 0.3 for 1 day ago, 0.2 for 2 days ago.\n\n    Why? Because the weekly pattern is strong, but recent days (especially the same day type) are also important.\n\n 7. However, note that the data from 2016-12-10 and 2016-12-11 are weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and 2016-12-12 is Monday. The day we are forecasting (2016-12-13) is a Tuesday. So we should compare with:\n    - 2016-12-06 (Tuesday, 7 days ago)\n    - 2016-12-12 (Monday, 1 day ago) but note: Monday is not the same day of the week as Tuesday. So we might adjust.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use the same day of the week from the previous week and then adjust with the most recent day? But the most recent day (Monday) might not be the same as Tuesday.\n\n 9. Let's use:\n    - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2016-12-06) for the base.\n    - Then adjust by the change from the previous week's Monday (2016-12-05) to the current week's Monday (2016-12-12). But we don't have 2016-12-05 data because our data starts at 2016-12-06.\n\n 10. Since we only have from 2016-12-06, we cannot go back to 2016-12-05. Therefore, we adjust the method.\n\n 11. Revised approach: \n     We have 7 days of data. We can compute the average of the same hour for:\n     - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2016-12-06) -> day0\n     - The same hour from the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n 12. We have:\n     - Tuesday (2016-12-06) and then the next Tuesday is the forecast day (2016-12-13). \n     - We also have the data for the last 7 days, so we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include weekends which are different.\n\n 13. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n     - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016-12-06) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last week.\n\n 14. How to compute the trend? We can compute the average price of the entire last week (168 hours) and the average price of the week before (the first 5 days: 2016-12-06 to 2016-12-11? but we only have 7 days total). Actually, we have exactly 7 days: 2016-12-06 to 2016-12-12.\n\n     Let:\n        week1 = 2016-12-06 to 2016-12-12 (7 days) -> we have this entire week.\n\n     But we don't have the week before to compute a trend? \n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n     For each hour h (0 to 23) of the day to forecast (2016-12-13), we take:\n        base = the value of hour h on 2016-12-06 (the previous Tuesday)\n        Then we adjust by the ratio of the average price of the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) to the average price of the same 3 days in the previous week? But we don't have the previous week's Saturday and Sunday? We have the previous week's Tuesday to Monday.\n\n 16. We have:\n        Previous week's Tuesday (2016-12-06) to Monday (2016-12-12) -> 7 days.\n\n        The same 7 days in the previous week? We don't have.\n\n 17. Given the complexity and the fact that we only have one week of data, we can use a simpler method:\n\n     We note that the prices on weekdays (Monday to Friday) are typically higher than weekends. The day we are forecasting (Tuesday) is a weekday.\n\n     We can compute the average for each hour of the weekdays in the available week (Tuesday 2016-12-06, Wednesday 2016-12-07, Thursday 2016-12-08, Friday 2016-12-09, and Monday 2016-12-12) and then use that as the base pattern? But then we are averaging different weekdays.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the weekdays that are available? But note: the available weekdays are:\n        Tuesday (2016-12-06), Wednesday (2016-12-07), Thursday (2016-12-08), Friday (2016-12-09), and Monday (2016-12-12).\n\n     However, Monday is the first day of the week and Tuesday the second, so they are adjacent but not the same.\n\n 19. We can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week (Tuesday) but we only have one Tuesday (2016-12-06). So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n 20. Therefore, we will use:\n        forecast_hour_h = (price_prev_tuesday_h + price_last_monday_h * 0.5 + price_last_friday_h * 0.3) / (1 + 0.5 + 0.3)\n\n     Why? \n        - The previous Tuesday (2016-12-06) is the same day -> weight 1.\n        - The last Monday (2016-12-12) is the most recent day and a weekday -> weight 0.5.\n        - The last Friday (2016-12-09) is the same weekday (Friday is a weekday and the last one) -> weight 0.3.\n\n     But note: the day we are forecasting is Tuesday, so Friday is not the same. Alternatively, we can use the last Wednesday and Thursday? \n\n 21. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But we have: Monday (2016-12-12), Friday (2016-12-09), Thursday (2016-12-08), Wednesday (2016-12-07), Tuesday (2016-12-06). We can take the last three weekdays: Monday, Friday, Thursday? But Monday is the most recent.\n\n 22. We decide to use:\n        forecast_hour_h = (price_prev_tuesday_h * 3 + price_last_monday_h * 2 + price_last_friday_h * 1) / (3+2+1)\n\n     Why?\n        - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday) is the most relevant -> weight 3.\n        - The last Monday is the most recent weekday and the day before the forecast day -> weight 2.\n        - The last Friday is the most recent Friday (which is a weekday) but not as relevant as Monday -> weight 1.\n\n 23. However, note that the last Monday (2016-12-12) is the day immediately before the forecast day, so it might have a stronger influence. Also, the last Friday (2016-12-09) is 4 days before, so less relevant.\n\n 24. Let's try with weights: 0.5 for the same day last week, 0.3 for yesterday (Monday), and 0.2 for the same day two weeks ago? But we don't have two weeks.\n\n 25. Since we only have one week, we cannot use two weeks ago. Therefore, we use the same day last week and yesterday, and maybe the day before yesterday? But yesterday was Monday and the day before yesterday was Sunday (which is not a weekday). So we avoid Sunday.\n\n 26. We can use:\n        forecast_hour_h = (price_prev_tuesday_h * 0.6) + (price_last_monday_h * 0.4)\n\n     Why? Because we have two weekdays: the same day last week and the most recent weekday (yesterday). We give more weight to the same day last week (0.6) and 0.4 to yesterday.\n\n 27. But note: the pattern on Tuesday might be more similar to the previous Tuesday than to yesterday (Monday). However, the immediate yesterday is also important.\n\n 28. We'll use the formula:\n        forecast_hour_h = 0.6 * (same hour on 2016-12-06) + 0.4 * (same hour on 2016-12-12)\n\n 29. However, we must consider that the price on 2016-12-12 (Monday) was generally higher than 2016-12-06 (Tuesday). So we are adjusting the previous Tuesday pattern with the recent Monday.\n\n 30. Let's test for one hour: hour 0:00\n        prev_tuesday (2016-12-06 0:00): 32.22\n        last_monday (2016-12-12 0:00): 28.30\n        forecast = 0.6 * 32.22 + 0.4 * 28.30 = 19.332 + 11.32 = 30.652\n\n 31. But we note that the price on the last Monday (2016-12-12) was a lower level than the previous Tuesday? So the forecast for the coming Tuesday at 0:00 would be 30.65.\n\n 32. However, we must also note that the overall trend in the last week has been decreasing? Let's see the average of the entire week:\n        2016-12-06: average = (32.22+32.10+...+33.26)/24 -> we can compute roughly: the day starts at 32 and goes up to 54 then down, average around 40?\n        2016-12-12: average = (28.30+28.59+...+31.28)/24 -> we see 28 to 46, average around 35? \n\n     So the overall level of the last day (Monday) is lower than the previous Tuesday. Therefore, the forecasted Tuesday might be lower than the previous Tuesday.\n\n 33. We'll use the same formula for all 24 hours.\n\n 34. But note: the data for 2016-12-12 (Monday) is the entire day, and we have the previous Tuesday (2016-12-06) entire day.\n\n 35. Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of the day 2016-12-13:\n        Let h = 0,1,...,23.\n        Let tuesday_prev = value at hour h on 2016-12-06\n        Let monday_prev = value at hour h on 2016-12-12\n        forecast = 0.6 * tuesday_prev + 0.4 * monday_prev\n\n 36. However, we must check if there are any missing values in these two days? The provided data does not have missing values.\n\n 37. Let's compute the 24 forecasts:\n\n        Hour 0: 0.6*32.22 + 0.4*28.30 = 19.332 + 11.32 = 30.652 -> 30.65\n        Hour 1: 0.6*32.10 + 0.4*28.59 = 19.26 + 11.436 = 30.696 -> 30.70\n        Hour 2: 0.6*32.43 + 0.4*28.33 = 19.458 + 11.332 = 30.79 -> 30.79\n        Hour 3: 0.6*32.63 + 0.4*28.31 = 19.578 + 11.324 = 30.902 -> 30.90\n        Hour 4: 0.6*33.48 + 0.4*29.15 = 20.088 + 11.66 = 31.748 -> 31.75\n        Hour 5: 0.6*34.81 + 0.4*31.19 = 20.886 + 12.476 = 33.362 -> 33.36\n        Hour 6: 0.6*38.44 + 0.4*35.30 = 23.064 + 14.12 = 37.184 -> 37.18\n        Hour 7: 0.6*46.66 + 0.4*40.21 = 27.996 + 16.084 = 44.08 -> 44.08\n        Hour 8: 0.6*53.24 + 0.4*40.20 = 31.944 + 16.08 = 48.024 -> 48.02\n        Hour 9: 0.6*52.60 + 0.4*40.06 = 31.56 + 16.024 = 47.584 -> 47.58\n        Hour 10: 0.6*47.67 + 0.4*39.03 = 28.602 + 15.612 = 44.214 -> 44.21\n        Hour 11: 0.6*46.60 + 0.4*39.29 = 27.96 + 15.716 = 43.676 -> 43.68\n        Hour 12: 0.6*45.80 + 0.4*39.93 = 27.48 + 15.972 = 43.452 -> 43.45\n        Hour 13: 0.6*46.30 + 0.4*40.56 = 27.78 + 16.224 = 44.004 -> 44.00\n        Hour 14: 0.6*46.85 + 0.4*41.79 = 28.11 + 16.716 = 44.826 -> 44.83\n        Hour 15: 0.6*47.53 + 0.4*43.58 = 28.518 + 17.432 = 45.95 -> 45.95\n        Hour 16: 0.6*50.21 + 0.4*43.01 = 30.126 + 17.204 = 47.33 -> 47.33\n        Hour 17: 0.6*54.98 + 0.4*46.44 = 32.988 + 18.576 = 51.564 -> 51.56\n        Hour 18: 0.6*47.59 + 0.4*42.52 = 28.554 + 17.008 = 45.562 -> 45.56\n        Hour 19: 0.6*40.10 + 0.4*37.67 = 24.06 + 15.068 = 39.128 -> 39.13\n        Hour 20: 0.6*38.38 + 0.4*35.51 = 23.028 + 14.204 = 37.232 -> 37.23\n        Hour 21: 0.6*36.84 + 0.4*34.44 = 22.104 + 13.776 = 35.88 -> 35.88\n        Hour 22: 0.6*34.96 + 0.4*32.60 = 20.976 + 13.04 = 34.016 -> 34.02\n        Hour 23: 0.6*33.26 + 0.4*31.28 = 19.956 + 12.512 = 32.468 -> 32.47\n\n 38. But note: the previous Tuesday (2016-12-06) had a peak at hour 8 (53.24) and the last Monday (2016-12-12) had a peak at hour 17 (46.44). Our forecast for hour 8 is 48.02 and hour 17 is 51.56. This seems reasonable.\n\n 39. However, we must consider that the day of the week matters: Tuesday and Monday are adjacent, but the pattern might be different. But without more data, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n 40. We output the forecast for 2016-12-13 00:00 to 2016-12-13 23:00.\n\n 41. Format: We must output in the same format as the input, but only the next 24 hours.\n\n 42. The dates for the next 24 hours are:\n        2016/12/13 0:00\n        2016/12/13 1:00\n        ...\n        2016/12/13 23:00\n\n 43. We output:\n\n        2016/12/13 0:00 30.65\n        2016/12/13 1:00 30.70\n        ... \n\n 44. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 45. Let's write the full 24 hours:\n\n        date             OT\n        2016/12/13 0:00 30.65\n        2016/12/13 1:00 30.70\n        2016/12/13 2:00 30.79\n        2016/12/13 3:00 30.90\n        2016/12/13 4:00 31.75\n        2016/12/13 5:00 33.36\n        2016/12/13 6:00 37.18\n        2016/12/13 7:00 44.08\n        2016/12/13 8:00 48.02\n        2016/12/13 9:00 47.58\n        2016/12/13 10:00 44.21\n        2016/12/13 11:00 43.68\n        2016/12/13 12:00 43.45\n        2016/12/13 13:00 44.00\n        2016/12/13 14:00 44.83\n        2016/12/13 15:00 45.95\n        2016/12/13 16:00 47.33\n        2016/12/13 17:00 51.56\n        2016/12/13 18:00 45.56\n        2016/12/13 19:00 39.13\n        2016/12/13 20:00 37.23\n        2016/12/13 21:00 35.88\n        2016/12/13 22:00 34.02\n        2016/12/13 23:00 32.47\n\n 46. We output in the required XML-like format.\n\n Note: This is a simple heuristic. In practice, one would use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet) and include other features (load forecast, wind forecast, etc.). But given the constraints, this is a reasonable approach.\n",
