        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/1/5 0:00 to 2016/1/11 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2016/1/12 0:00 to 2016/1/12 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we note that the data is given in chronological order and there are no gaps in the dates and times.\n\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we can use a time series model. Given the hourly data and the need for a 24-hour forecast, we can consider the following:\n    - The data exhibits daily seasonality (24 hours) and also weekly patterns (though we only have one week of data, we can see the pattern repeats roughly every day).\n\n 3. We note that the prices have:\n    - Higher prices during the day (especially morning to evening) and lower at night.\n    - Weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher peaks than weekends.\n\n 4. The last day in the data is Monday (2016/1/11). The next 24 hours are for Tuesday (2016/1/12). We can expect a pattern similar to previous weekdays.\n\n 5. Approach:\n    We can use a simple method by taking the average of the same hour from the previous weekdays (since we only have one week of data, we can use the same days from the week). However, note that the data starts on a Tuesday (2016/1/5 was a Tuesday) and ends on a Monday (2016/1/11). The next day is Tuesday (2016/1/12).\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last week's Tuesday (2016/1/5) as a base and adjust with the recent trend.\n\n    But note: the data from 2016/1/5 (Tuesday) to 2016/1/11 (Monday) is 7 days. The next day is Tuesday, so we can use the same day of the week from the previous week (2016/1/5) and also consider the most recent day (Monday, 2016/1/11) to adjust.\n\n 6. However, the problem is that the electricity prices are influenced by many factors (like load, wind, etc.) but we are only given the historical prices. So we must rely on the time series pattern.\n\n 7. We can use an average of the same hour from the last 7 days? But we only have one Tuesday (2016/1/5). So we can use that day as a base and then adjust by the overall trend of the week.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But given the data has strong daily seasonality, we can use a seasonal naive approach: using the same hour from exactly one week ago. However, we note that the next day is Tuesday and we have one Tuesday in the data (2016/1/5). So we can use the prices from 2016/1/5 as the forecast for 2016/1/12.\n\n    But let's check: the data from 2016/1/5 (Tuesday) and 2016/1/12 (next Tuesday) might be similar? However, we see that the week of 2016/1/11 (Monday) had higher prices than the previous Monday (which we don't have because our data starts on Tuesday). So we might adjust.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days? But the pattern on weekends is different. Since the next day is a Tuesday, we can use the last Tuesday (2016/1/5) and the last Monday (2016/1/11) to adjust? But that might not be directly comparable.\n\n10. Considering the limitations, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from the last few weekdays. We have two weekdays that are Tuesdays? Actually only one. So we can use multiple Tuesdays? We don't have.\n\n11. We can use a model that captures the daily pattern and the level of the series. The level of the series in the last day (Monday 2016/1/11) is higher than the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday. But we have the previous Tuesday and then the next days. We note that the prices on 2016/1/11 (Monday) were generally higher than on 2016/1/5 (Tuesday). So we can adjust the base Tuesday (2016/1/5) by the ratio of the last two days (Monday and Sunday) to the same days in the previous week? But we don't have Sunday from the previous week.\n\n12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only using the target variable, we can use a simple method: \n    - For each hour h (0 to 23) of the next day (Tuesday 2016/1/12), we take the value of the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016/1/5) and adjust it by the average change from the previous Tuesday to the last day (Monday 2016/1/11) for the same hour.\n\n    However, we don't have a direct same day of the week for Monday in the previous week. So we can do:\n\n    Let F_h be the forecast for hour h on 2016/1/12.\n    Let P_prevTue_h be the price at hour h on 2016/1/5 (Tuesday).\n    Let P_lastMon_h be the price at hour h on 2016/1/11 (Monday).\n\n    But we don't have a Monday from the previous week to compare. So we can use the overall level of the week.\n\n13. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays (Tuesday to Monday) and then adjust by the most recent day. But note that the pattern on Tuesday might be different from Monday.\n\n14. Given the time and simplicity, we can use the following:\n\n    We compute the average price for the entire last day (Monday 2016/1/11) and the average price for the base Tuesday (2016/1/5). Then we adjust the base Tuesday by the ratio of the last Monday's average to the base Tuesday's average? But that would adjust the level.\n\n    Steps:\n      - Calculate the average price for 2016/1/5 (Tuesday): \n          avg_prevTue = (17.68+17.33+...+18.24)/24 = 22.95 (approx)\n      - Calculate the average price for 2016/1/11 (Monday): \n          avg_lastMon = (21.42+20.09+...+21.79)/24 = 33.33 (approx)\n\n      Then the adjustment factor = avg_lastMon / avg_prevTue = 33.33 / 22.95 \u2248 1.45\n\n      Then for each hour h, F_h = P_prevTue_h * (avg_lastMon / avg_prevTue)\n\n    But this might not capture the intraday pattern changes.\n\n15. Another method: use the same hour from the previous Tuesday and then adjust by the change from the previous Tuesday to the current Monday for the same hour? But that would be:\n\n      F_h = P_prevTue_h * (P_lastMon_h / P_prevMon_h)   -> but we don't have P_prevMon_h (the Monday of the previous week).\n\n16. We can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (Saturday, Monday, Sunday) but the pattern on Saturday and Sunday is different from Tuesday.\n\n17. Considering the above, and the fact that we are limited by the data, we can use a naive seasonal method with a week lag, but adjusted by the overall level of the last day.\n\n    We'll do: \n        F_h = P_prevTue_h * (avg_lastMon / avg_prevTue)\n\n    But let's compute the averages:\n\n        For 2016/1/5 (Tuesday): \n            sum = 17.68+17.33+17.24+17.32+17.66+18.22+19.44+22.72+26.55+26.73+27.15+26.11+23.81+22.58+23.52+27.10+33.83+34.09+27.93+23.79+20.74+20.18+19.24+18.24\n            = 550.8\n            avg_prevTue = 550.8 / 24 = 22.95\n\n        For 2016/1/11 (Monday):\n            sum = 21.42+20.09+19.82+19.39+20.20+22.41+27.33+45.46+46.37+44.74+39.18+39.87+44.08+44.67+43.38+44.54+44.43+41.60+38.87+34.29+28.08+25.79+23.37+21.79\n            = 800.0\n            avg_lastMon = 800.0 / 24 = 33.333\n\n        factor = 33.333 / 22.95 = 1.4526\n\n    Then for each hour h, we take the value from 2016/1/5 at hour h and multiply by 1.4526.\n\n    Example for 0:00: 17.68 * 1.4526 \u2248 25.68\n\n    But let's check: the price on 2016/1/11 at 0:00 was 21.42, and on 2016/1/5 at 0:00 was 17.68. The ratio for 0:00 is 21.42/17.68\u22481.21, which is different from 1.45. So this method might not perfectly capture the hourly variations.\n\n18. Another idea: use the same hour from the previous week and then adjust by the ratio of the same hour from the last day (Monday) to the same hour from the same day of the week one week ago? But we don't have Monday one week ago.\n\n19. We can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (Sunday, Monday, and Saturday) for the same hour? But Saturday and Sunday are weekends and have different patterns. The next day is a Tuesday, so we should rely more on weekday patterns.\n\n20. Given the constraints, we only have one week of data, we decide to use the previous Tuesday (2016/1/5) as the base pattern and adjust the level by the overall change observed in the average of the last day (Monday) compared to the base Tuesday.\n\n    We'll compute the factor as above and apply.\n\n21. However, note that the data shows a general increase in prices over the week. The average on Tuesday was 22.95, Wednesday: (20.15+...+20.08)/24 = (let's compute quickly) -> \n        Wed: 20.15+19.74+19.43+19.47+19.76+20.21+21.13+24.84+28.21+34.01+35.78+39.26+38.52+38.72+34.91+38.43+42.45+46.41+45.35+36.25+30.68+26.89+21.52+20.08 = 700.0 -> 700/24=29.166\n    Thursday: 22.74+21.88+21.64+21.76+22.39+26.45+33.44+54.97+59.70+58.03+57.04+54.94+47.74+42.90+43.71+49.73+59.60+58.09+41.63+34.45+30.52+27.17+23.25+20.84 = 950.0 -> 950/24=39.583\n    Friday: 21.36+20.71+20.23+20.17+20.26+21.65+25.63+35.55+46.11+37.84+34.73+34.43+34.09+31.70+34.42+43.80+48.51+48.94+49.75+42.84+34.43+28.78+26.49+23.70 = 750.0 -> 750/24=31.25\n    Saturday: 25.69+23.95+22.96+22.77+22.29+22.64+22.74+24.02+25.02+26.51+27.88+28.60+27.77+26.98+27.08+29.52+34.48+45.40+33.10+27.49+24.32+23.47+22.70+21.91 = 650.0 -> 650/24=27.083\n    Sunday: 21.36+20.06+19.80+19.62+19.47+19.62+19.62+19.86+19.86+20.61+21.44+22.07+22.16+21.85+21.76+22.56+24.70+27.88+27.37+25.90+24.45+23.82+22.78+21.88 = 550.0 -> 550/24=22.916\n    Monday: 800.0/24=33.333\n\n    The average for the week: (22.95+29.166+39.583+31.25+27.083+22.916+33.333)/7 = 29.32\n\n    The next day is Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was 22.95. The overall average of the week is 29.32, so the base Tuesday was below average. We might expect the next Tuesday to be around the overall average? But that might not be.\n\n22. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for all the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) and then use that as the forecast for Tuesday? But note that Monday is the day before Tuesday, so we can use the average of the same hour for the weekdays.\n\n    We have:\n        Tuesday (2016/1/5): 24 values\n        Wednesday (2016/1/6): 24 values\n        Thursday (2016/1/7): 24 values\n        Friday (2016/1/8): 24 values\n        Monday (2016/1/11): 24 values   (note: Monday is a weekday, and we skip the weekend)\n\n    Then for hour 0:00, we average the values from:\n        Tue: 17.68\n        Wed: 20.15\n        Thu: 22.74\n        Fri: 21.36\n        Mon: 21.42\n\n        average = (17.68+20.15+22.74+21.36+21.42)/5 = 103.35/5 = 20.67\n\n    Similarly for each hour.\n\n    But note: the pattern on Monday might be different from Tuesday? And we are using Monday to predict Tuesday? Also, we are including the previous Tuesday which was a week ago.\n\n    This method might be better because it uses multiple weekdays and captures the recent Monday.\n\n23. We decide to use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday) for the next Tuesday.\n\n    Why Monday? Because in electricity markets, the day before (Monday) is the most recent and might have a similar pattern to Tuesday? Also, we don't have a more recent Tuesday.\n\n    We have 5 weekdays: \n        Day1: Tuesday (2016/1/5)\n        Day2: Wednesday (2016/1/6)\n        Day3: Thursday (2016/1/7)\n        Day4: Friday (2016/1/8)\n        Day5: Monday (2016/1/11)   [note: we skip the weekend days]\n\n    For each hour h (0 to 23), we compute the average of the price at hour h for these 5 days.\n\n    Example for h=0 (0:00):\n        values: [17.68, 20.15, 22.74, 21.36, 21.42] -> average = (17.68+20.15+22.74+21.36+21.42)/5 = 103.35/5 = 20.67\n\n    For h=1 (1:00):\n        values: [17.33, 19.74, 21.88, 20.71, 20.09] -> (17.33+19.74+21.88+20.71+20.09)/5 = 99.75/5 = 19.95\n\n    And so on.\n\n24. We note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included because they have different patterns and the next day is a weekday.\n\n25. Let's compute the forecast for all 24 hours:\n\n    Hour 0: (17.68, 20.15, 22.74, 21.36, 21.42) -> 20.67\n    Hour 1: (17.33, 19.74, 21.88, 20.71, 20.09) -> 19.95\n    Hour 2: (17.24, 19.43, 21.64, 20.23, 19.82) -> 19.67\n    Hour 3: (17.32, 19.47, 21.76, 20.17, 19.39) -> 19.62\n    Hour 4: (17.66, 19.76, 22.39, 20.26, 20.20) -> 20.05\n    Hour 5: (18.22, 20.21, 26.45, 21.65, 22.41) -> 21.79\n    Hour 6: (19.44, 21.13, 33.44, 25.63, 27.33) -> 25.39\n    Hour 7: (22.72, 24.84, 54.97, 35.55, 45.46) -> 36.71\n    Hour 8: (26.55, 28.21, 59.70, 46.11, 46.37) -> 41.39\n    Hour 9: (26.73, 34.01, 58.03, 37.84, 44.74) -> 40.27\n    Hour 10: (27.15, 35.78, 57.04, 34.73, 39.18) -> 38.78\n    Hour 11: (26.11, 39.26, 54.94, 34.43, 39.87) -> 38.92\n    Hour 12: (23.81, 38.52, 47.74, 34.09, 44.08) -> 37.65\n    Hour 13: (22.58, 38.72, 42.90, 31.70, 44.67) -> 36.11\n    Hour 14: (23.52, 34.91, 43.71, 34.42, 43.38) -> 35.99\n    Hour 15: (27.10, 38.43, 49.73, 43.80, 44.54) -> 40.72\n    Hour 16: (33.83, 42.45, 59.60, 48.51, 44.43) -> 45.76\n    Hour 17: (34.09, 46.41, 58.09, 48.94, 41.60) -> 45.83\n    Hour 18: (27.93, 45.35, 41.63, 49.75, 38.87) -> 40.71\n    Hour 19: (23.79, 36.25, 34.45, 42.84, 34.29) -> 34.32\n    Hour 20: (20.74, 30.68, 30.52, 34.43, 28.08) -> 28.89\n    Hour 21: (20.18, 26.89, 27.17, 28.78, 25.79) -> 25.76\n    Hour 22: (19.24, 21.52, 23.25, 26.49, 23.37) -> 22.77\n    Hour 23: (18.24, 20.08, 20.84, 23.70, 21.79) -> 20.93\n\n26. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n27. The forecast for the next 24 hours (2016/1/12 0:00 to 2016/1/12 23:00) is:\n\n        0:00: 20.67\n        1:00: 19.95\n        2:00: 19.67\n        3:00: 19.62\n        4:00: 20.05\n        5:00: 21.79\n        6:00: 25.39\n        7:00: 36.71\n        8:00: 41.39\n        9:00: 40.27\n        10:00: 38.78\n        11:00: 38.92\n        12:00: 37.65\n        13:00: 36.11\n        14:00: 35.99\n        15:00: 40.72\n        16:00: 45.76\n        17:00: 45.83\n        18:00: 40.71\n        19:00: 34.32\n        20:00: 28.89\n        21:00: 25.76\n        22:00: 22.77\n        23:00: 20.93\n\n28. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple method and in practice, more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, or incorporating exogenous variables) would be used. But given the problem constraints (only historical prices and no other variables) and the short data, we use this averaging method.\n",
