        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016/10/18 0:00 to 2016/10/24 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016/10/25 0:00 to 2016/10/25 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 consecutive hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting, we can use a time series model. Given the hourly data and the strong daily seasonality (as seen in the pattern repeating every 24 hours), we can use a seasonal model or a simple averaging of the same hour in the past days.\n\n Approach:\n We note that electricity prices exhibit:\n   - Daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)\n   - Weekly seasonality (though we only have one week of data, we can use the same days of the week)\n\n However, we only have 7 days (168 hours) of data. The next day (2016/10/25) is a Tuesday (since 2016/10/18 was a Tuesday). So we can look at the same hour of the previous days, especially the same day of the week (i.e., the previous Tuesday: 2016/10/18) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n But note: the data from 2016/10/18 (Tuesday) to 2016/10/24 (Monday) is provided. The next day is Tuesday (2016/10/25). So we can use the previous Tuesday (2016/10/18) as a base and adjust with the recent days.\n\n However, a more robust method is to use the average of the same hour over the available days, but we only have one Tuesday. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from the last 7 days, giving more weight to the most recent days and the same day of the week.\n\n Proposed method:\n For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2016/10/25), we compute:\n   forecast_h = (w1 * price_h_prev_tuesday + w2 * price_h_prev_day + w3 * average of the same hour over the last 7 days) / (w1 + w2 + w3)\n\n But note: the previous Tuesday (2016/10/18) is 7 days ago, and the previous day (2016/10/24) is Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which includes Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and the same day of the week (Tuesday). However, we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Since we are limited by the data, we can use:\n   forecast_h = (price_h_prev_tuesday * 0.4 + price_h_prev_day * 0.4 + price_h_2days_ago * 0.2) \n   but 2 days ago was Sunday (2016/10/23) and we are forecasting Tuesday, which might not be the best.\n\n Another common approach is to use the average of the same hour over the last week (7 days) but with exponential weighting (more weight to recent days). However, we have exactly 7 days.\n\n We can try:\n   forecast_h = (1/7) * (price_h_day1 + price_h_day2 + ... + price_h_day7)\n\n But that would ignore the weekly pattern and the recent trend.\n\n Considering the data, we see that the prices on 2016/10/24 (Monday) were generally higher than the previous Tuesday (2016/10/18). Also, the day before (Sunday 2016/10/23) had a different pattern.\n\n Since the task is short-term and we don't have exogenous variables (like load or wind forecasts) we rely on the historical prices.\n\n We decide to use a weighted average of the same hour from:\n   - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 7 days ago): weight 0.5\n   - The previous day (Monday): weight 0.3\n   - The day before the previous day (Sunday): weight 0.2\n\n Why? Because the same day of the week is important, and the most recent two days also have an impact.\n\n Steps for each hour h in [0,23]:\n   Let p1 = price at hour h on 2016/10/18 (Tuesday)\n   Let p2 = price at hour h on 2016/10/24 (Monday)\n   Let p3 = price at hour h on 2016/10/23 (Sunday)\n\n   Then forecast_h = (0.5 * p1 + 0.3 * p2 + 0.2 * p3)\n\n But note: the day of the week for the forecast is Tuesday, so we are using the previous Tuesday, and the two days before the forecast day (Monday and Sunday) are not Tuesdays. This might not be ideal.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and then adjust by the difference between the same day last week (Tuesday) and the average of the three days of the previous week (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for that hour? That might be complex.\n\n Given the simplicity and the data available, we will use the weighted average as above.\n\n However, let's check the data for a specific hour to see if it makes sense.\n\n Example: Hour 0:00 (the first hour of the day)\n   Previous Tuesday (2016/10/18 0:00): 31.13\n   Previous day (Monday 2016/10/24 0:00): 31.97\n   Sunday (2016/10/23 0:00): 32.83\n\n   Then forecast for 2016/10/25 0:00 = 0.5*31.13 + 0.3*31.97 + 0.2*32.83 =  = 15.565 + 9.591 + 6.566 = 31.722\n\n But we note that the prices at 0:00 have been:\n   2016/10/18: 31.13\n   2016/10/19: 31.05\n   2016/10/20: 31.18\n   2016/10/21: 32.18\n   2016/10/22: 33.03\n   2016/10/23: 32.83\n   2016/10/24: 31.97\n\n The average of these 7 days: (31.13+31.05+31.18+32.18+33.03+32.83+31.97)/7 = 31.91\n\n Our forecast 31.72 is close to the average.\n\n But note: the next day is Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was 31.13. The recent Monday was 31.97 and Sunday was 32.83. So 31.72 seems a reasonable compromise.\n\n We'll apply this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, we must note that the pattern of the week might be different. For example, weekdays (Monday to Friday) are different from weekends (Saturday and Sunday). The forecast day is a Tuesday (weekday). So we might want to give more weight to weekdays? But we are already using the previous Tuesday (which is a weekday) and the Monday (weekday) and Sunday (weekend). The Sunday might be less representative.\n\n We can adjust the weights: \n   previous Tuesday (weekday): 0.6\n   previous Monday (weekday): 0.3\n   previous Sunday (weekend): 0.1\n\n Then for 0:00: 0.6*31.13 + 0.3*31.97 + 0.1*32.83 = 18.678 + 9.591 + 3.283 = 31.552\n\n But we don't have a strong reason to choose one set of weights over another.\n\n After reviewing the data, we see that the prices on weekdays are generally higher during the day (especially morning and evening peaks) than weekends. The previous Tuesday (2016/10/18) had a peak of 39.89 at 8:00, while Sunday (2016/10/23) had a peak of 39.24 at 18:00. The Monday (2016/10/24) had a peak of 43.91 at 18:00.\n\n Since the forecast day is a weekday, we want to capture the weekday pattern. Therefore, we give more weight to the same weekday (Tuesday) and the most recent weekday (Monday). We reduce the weight for Sunday.\n\n We choose:\n   w1 (previous Tuesday): 0.6\n   w2 (previous day, Monday): 0.3\n   w3 (Sunday): 0.1\n\n Now, we compute for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n Let's do one more example: hour 8:00 (a peak hour)\n   Previous Tuesday (2016/10/18 8:00): 39.89\n   Previous Monday (2016/10/24 8:00): 42.53\n   Sunday (2016/10/23 8:00): 33.47\n\n   Forecast = 0.6*39.89 + 0.3*42.53 + 0.1*33.47 = 23.934 + 12.759 + 3.347 = 40.04\n\n This seems reasonable: it's between the previous Tuesday and Monday, and the Sunday was much lower (so it brings it a little down).\n\n We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note that the data for the last day (Monday 2016/10/24) had a very high peak at 18:00 (43.91) and the previous Tuesday (2016/10/18) at 18:00 was 38.66. The Sunday at 18:00 was 39.24.\n\n For 18:00:\n   Forecast = 0.6*38.66 + 0.3*43.91 + 0.1*39.24 = 23.196 + 13.173 + 3.924 = 40.293\n\n This is higher than the previous Tuesday and lower than Monday, which seems acceptable.\n\n We'll generate the forecast for 24 hours.\n\n Steps:\n   For hour h in 0 to 23:\n        p1 = value at hour h on 2016/10/18\n        p2 = value at hour h on 2016/10/24\n        p3 = value at hour h on 2016/10/23\n        forecast = 0.6 * p1 + 0.3 * p2 + 0.1 * p3\n\n But note: the data for 2016/10/18 starts at 0:00 and ends at 23:00, and similarly for the other days.\n\n We have the data in the format: \n   2016/10/18: [31.13, 30.35, ... , 30.86] (24 values)\n   2016/10/24: [31.97, 31.54, ... , 33.06] (24 values)\n   2016/10/23: [32.83, 32.50, ... , 33.39] (24 values)\n\n We'll create a list for each day and then compute.\n\n Alternatively, we can extract the hour from the given data. But note the data is in order.\n\n We can index the historical data:\n\n   Day1: 2016/10/18: index 0 to 23\n   Day2: 2016/10/19: index 24 to 47\n   Day3: 2016/10/20: index 48 to 71\n   Day4: 2016/10/21: index 72 to 95\n   Day5: 2016/10/22: index 96 to 119\n   Day6: 2016/10/23: index 120 to 143\n   Day7: 2016/10/24: index 144 to 167\n\n So for hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2016/10/25), we need:\n   p1 = data[h]   (because 2016/10/18 is the first day, hour h is at index h)\n   p2 = data[144 + h]   (2016/10/24 is the last day, starting at index 144)\n   p3 = data[120 + h]   (2016/10/23 is the day before last, starting at index 120)\n\n Then compute: forecast_h = 0.6 * p1 + 0.3 * p2 + 0.1 * p3\n\n We'll do this for h=0 to 23.\n\n Let's write the forecast for 2016/10/25 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n We must output the format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2016/10/25 0:00 <forecast_value>\n        2016/10/25 1:00 <forecast_value>\n        ...\n        2016/10/25 23:00 <forecast_value>\n    </answer>\n\n We'll compute the values and round to 2 decimal places.\n\n But note: the data provided has two decimal places.\n\n Let's compute:\n\n Hour 0 (0:00):\n   p1 = 31.13
