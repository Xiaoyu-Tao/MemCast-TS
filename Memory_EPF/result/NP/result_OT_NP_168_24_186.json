        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016/7/26 0:00 to 2016/8/1 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2016/8/2 0:00 to 2016/8/2 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 entries for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed price) and no other features (like grid load or wind power forecasts). Therefore, we must rely on the time series of prices alone.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the price, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data, we expect daily and weekly seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data provided is for 7 days (168 hours). We can use a simple model that captures:\n   - Daily seasonality (24 hours)\n   - Weekly seasonality (168 hours) might be less evident in just one week, but we can try.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to forecast. We don't have the capacity to run complex models, so we can use a simple average or a naive seasonal approach.\n\n Idea: \n We can use a seasonal naive method: for each hour in the next day, we use the same hour from the previous day (or average of the same hour over the past few days?).\n\n However, note that the last day (2016/8/1) is a Monday. The next day (2016/8/2) is a Tuesday. We can look at the previous Tuesday? But we only have one week of data.\n\n Since we only have one week, we can use:\n   - The same hour from the previous day (Monday to Tuesday) but we don't have a Tuesday? We have:\n        Day 1: Tuesday? Actually, 2016/7/26 is a Tuesday (checking a calendar: 2016/7/26 was a Tuesday, 2016/8/1 was a Monday, so 2016/8/2 is a Tuesday).\n\n So we have:\n   - The same day of the week: the previous Tuesday was 2016/7/26.\n\n But note: the pattern might change due to other factors. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last few days for the same hour.\n\n However, the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's look at the last 7 days:\n\n   We have:\n     2016/7/26 (Tuesday) -> 2016/8/2 (Tuesday)\n     2016/7/27 (Wednesday) -> not available for next day? but we are forecasting Tuesday.\n\n Since we only have one Tuesday in the data (2016/7/26), we can use that day as a template? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But note: the last day is Monday (2016/8/1) and the day before was Sunday (2016/7/31), etc.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (none in the given data) and provide the forecast.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the data available, I propose:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) on 2016/8/2 (Tuesday), we take the average of the same hour h from the last 7 days (i.e., from 2016/7/26 to 2016/8/1). \n\n Why 7 days? Because we have exactly 7 days and we want to capture the weekly pattern.\n\n But note: the data includes weekdays and weekends. The next day is a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday (2016/7/26) and the rest are different days. However, averaging over the week might smooth out the daily patterns.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous week (i.e., 2016/7/26) and adjust by the recent trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only using the target variable, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n Steps for each hour h (0 to 23) of 2016/8/2:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_h on 2016/7/26 + price_h on 2016/7/27 + ... + price_h on 2016/8/1) / 7\n\n But note: the last 7 is from 2016/7/26 to 2016/8/1 (both inclusive) for the same hour.\n\n However, for hour 0: \n   2016/7/26 0:00 -> 25.13\n   2016/7/27 0:00 -> 25.20\n   2016/7/28 0:00 -> 24.31\n   2016/7/29 0:00 -> 24.93\n   2016/7/30 0:00 -> 25.18\n   2016/7/31 0:00 -> 25.03\n   2016/8/1 0:00 -> 24.24\n\n   Average = (25.13+25.20+24.31+24.93+25.18+25.03+24.24) / 7 = ?\n\n Let me compute:\n\n   25.13 + 25.20 = 50.33\n   +24.31 = 74.64\n   +24.93 = 99.57\n   +25.18 = 124.75\n   +25.03 = 149.78\n   +24.24 = 174.02\n\n   Average = 174.02 / 7 = 24.86 (rounded to two decimals)\n\n Similarly, we do for every hour.\n\n However, note: the data shows a decreasing trend? But we are averaging over the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the model, and we are to provide a forecast, I will use the simple average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n But note: the last day (2016/8/1) was a Monday and the next day is Tuesday. We could also consider using the same day of the week (i.e., only the previous Tuesday) but that would be only one data point and might be volatile.\n\n Given the data is limited, the 7-day average is a safe and common approach.\n\n Let's compute for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (25.13 + 25.20 + 24.31 + 24.93 + 25.18 + 25.03 + 24.24) / 7 = 174.02 / 7 = 24.86\n Hour 1: (25.04 + 25.08 + 24.09 + 24.68 + 24.54 + 24.28 + 23.10) / 7 = \n   25.04+25.08=50.12\n   +24.09=74.21\n   +24.68=98.89\n   +24.54=123.43\n   +24.28=147.71\n   +23.10=170.81\n   170.81/7 = 24.40\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. Since there are none, we proceed.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model? But we are not given any other data and we are to forecast only with the provided OT.\n\n Considering the constraints, we use the 7-day average per hour.\n\n Let me compute the next 24 hours (for 2016/8/2 0:00 to 2016/8/2 23:00) by hour:\n\n We'll create a list of the historical data for each hour (0 to 23) from the 7 days:\n\n   Hour 0: [25.13, 25.20, 24.31, 24.93, 25.18, 25.03, 24.24] -> 174.02 -> 24.86\n   Hour 1: [25.04, 25.08, 24.09, 24.68, 24.54, 24.28, 23.10] -> 170.81 -> 24.40\n   Hour 2: [24.65, 24.90, 23.96, 24.25, 24.17, 22.97, 22.61] -> \n        24.65+24.90=49.55, +23.96=73.51, +24.25=97.76, +24.17=121.93, +22.97=144.90, +22.61=167.51 -> 167.51/7=23.93\n   Hour 3: [24.11, 24.61, 23.58, 23.00, 23.53, 22.56, 21.96] -> \n        24.11+24.61=48.72, +23.58=72.30, +23.00=95.30, +23.53=118.83, +22.56=141.39, +21.96=163.35 -> 163.35/7=23.34\n   Hour 4: [24.10, 24.64, 23.43, 23.08, 23.01, 22.14, 21.76] -> \n        24.10+24.64=48.74, +23.43=72.17, +23.08=95.25, +23.01=118.26, +22.14=140.40, +21.76=162.16 -> 162.16/7=23.17\n   Hour 5: [24.68, 24.93, 24.23, 24.25, 23.20, 21.65, 22.96] -> \n        24.68+24.93=49.61, +24.23=73.84, +24.25=98.09, +23.20=121.29, +21.65=142.94, +22.96=165.90 -> 165.90/7=23.70\n   Hour 6: [26.09, 26.55, 25.39, 25.43, 23.64, 20.98, 25.60] -> \n        26.09+26.55=52.64, +25.39=78.03, +25.43=103.46, +23.64=127.10, +20.98=148.08, +25.60=173.68 -> 173.68/7=24.81\n   Hour 7: [28.22, 27.82, 26.58, 27.30, 24.14, 21.99, 27.11] -> \n        28.22+27.82=56.04, +26.58=82.62, +27.30=109.92, +24.14=134.06, +21.99=156.05, +27.11=183.16 -> 183.16/7=26.17\n   Hour 8: [28.65, 28.30, 27.49, 28.02, 24.52, 23.38, 28.04] -> \n        28.65+28.30=56.95, +27.49=84.44, +28.02=112.46, +24.52=136.98, +23.38=160.36, +28.04=188.40 -> 188.40/7=26.91\n   Hour 9: [29.09, 28.73, 27.82, 28.30, 25.06, 24.15, 27.63] -> \n        29.09+28.73=57.82, +27.82=85.64, +28.30=113.94, +25.06=139.00, +24.15=163.15, +27.63=190.78 -> 190.78/7=27.25\n   Hour 10: [29.18, 29.03, 27.97, 28.49, 25.08, 24.49, 26.86] -> \n        29.18+29.03=58.21, +27.97=86.18, +28.49=114.67, +25.08=139.75, +24.49=164.24, +26.86=191.10 -> 191.10/7=27.30\n   Hour 11: [29.05, 28.58, 27.89, 28.37, 25.03, 25.04, 26.85] -> \n        29.05+28.58=57.63, +27.89=85.52, +28.37=113.89, +25.03=138.92, +25.04=163.96, +26.85=190.81 -> 190.81/7=27.26\n   Hour 12: [28.44, 28.47, 27.91, 27.61, 24.95, 25.01, 26.61] -> \n        28.44+28.47=56.91, +27.91=84.82, +27.61=112.43, +24.95=137.38, +25.01=162.39, +26.61=189.00 -> 189.00/7=27.00\n   Hour 13: [28.19, 28.27, 27.33, 26.77, 24.62, 24.54, 26.48] -> \n        28.19+28.27=56.46, +27.33=83.79, +26.77=110.56, +24.62=135.18, +24.54=159.72, +26.48=186.20 -> 186.20/7=26.60\n   Hour 14: [28.02, 27.83, 27.15, 26.29, 24.30, 24.04, 26.22] -> \n        28.02+27.83=55.85, +27.15=83.00, +26.29=109.29, +24.30=133.59, +24.04=157.63, +26.22=183.85 -> 183.85/7=26.26\n   Hour 15: [28.01, 27.77, 26.92, 26.16, 24.31, 23.91, 25.96] -> \n        28.01+27.77=55.78, +26.92=82.70, +26.16=108.86, +24.31=133.17, +23.91=157.08, +25.96=183.04 -> 183.04/7=26.15\n   Note: the last value for hour 15 is 25.96?

Actually, the input uses:\n   \"2016/7/26 0:00\" for July 26, and \"2016/8/1 0:00\" for August 1.\n\n So for August 2, we write \"2016/8/2\".\n\n However, note that the input for the first day of the month: \"2016/8/1\" so we use the same.\n\n We output exactly as above.\n\n Let me write the answer accordingly.\n",
