        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013/8/13 0:00 to 2013/8/19 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2013/8/20 0:00 to 2013/8/20 23:00).\n\n Since the problem states that we are missing values, we note that the provided data does not have any missing values in the given time period. Therefore, we can proceed without imputation for the historical data.\n\n However, we are only given the 'OT' (observed electricity price) and not the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts. The problem says the dataset contains those, but we are only provided with the price. Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\n Given the requirement for short-term forecasting (24 hours ahead), we can use a time series model that captures daily seasonality. The data shows a clear daily pattern (lower at night, higher during the day).\n\n We note that the data has 7 days (168 hours). We can use a model that uses the last few days to predict the next day. Since we are only using the target variable, we can use an autoregressive model or a simple seasonal model.\n\n Approach:\n 1. We observe that the pattern repeats every 24 hours (daily seasonality). Therefore, we can use a seasonal naive approach: the forecast for a particular hour is the same as the observed value at the same hour one week (or one day) ago.\n\n However, note that the data shows weekly patterns? Let's check:\n\n We have data from Tuesday (2013/8/13) to Monday (2013/8/19). The next day is Tuesday (2013/8/20). Therefore, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday, 2013/8/13) as a base.\n\n But note: the data of 2013/8/13 (Tuesday) and 2013/8/20 (next Tuesday) might be similar. However, we have 7 days of data, so we can also average the same hour of the last 7 days? But note that the weekend (17th and 18th) shows lower prices.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last few days, but we only have one week of data.\n\n Since we are only the target variable and no exogenous variables, and we are to forecast 24 hours, we can use:\n\n Option 1: Seasonal Naive with seasonality of 24 hours: \n   y_{t+24} = y_t   -> but that would be for one day ahead, not one week.\n\n Option 2: Weekly Seasonal Naive: \n   We forecast the next 24 hours (Tuesday) by taking the 24 hours of the previous Tuesday (2013/8/13). However, we have more recent data and the pattern might have changed.\n\n Option 3: We can use an average of the same hour over the last 7 days. But note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns. Since the next day is a Tuesday, we might want to use only the previous Tuesday? Or the average of the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where more recent days are given more weight.\n\n However, note that the problem does not specify the day of the week for the forecast period. We know the last date in the history is 2013/8/19 (Monday) at 23:00. So the next 24 hours are 2013/8/20 0:00 to 2013/8/20 23:00, which is a Tuesday.\n\n We have one previous Tuesday (2013/8/13) and also the Monday (2013/8/19) just before. But the Monday pattern is not the same as Tuesday.\n\n Considering the limitations, a simple and effective method is to use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2013/8/13) as the forecast for 2013/8/20. However, we note that the prices on 2013/8/19 (Monday) were higher than 2013/8/12 (the Monday of the previous week is not provided, we only have from 2013/8/13). So we don't have a full week of the same type.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (which includes the weekend) but that might lower the forecast for a Tuesday.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the same weekday over the available history. But we only have one Tuesday (2013/8/13) and one Monday (2013/8/19) and one Sunday (2013/8/18), etc.\n\n Given the data limitations, I propose:\n\n Since we have 7 days, we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the last 7 days. This will smooth out the daily pattern and account for the weekly cycle? But note: the weekdays and weekends are different. However, we don't have multiple weeks to average per weekday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last available same weekday (which is 7 days ago) and then adjust it by the recent trend. But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only asked for a forecast, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for the next Tuesday? That might not be representative.\n\n Considering the above, I decide to use the following:\n\n We note that the prices on 2013/8/19 (Monday) were higher than the previous days. And the next day is a Tuesday. We have a Tuesday from 7 days ago (2013/8/13). We can adjust the previous Tuesday by the change from the previous Monday (2013/8/12, which we don't have) to the current Monday (2013/8/19). But we don't have 2013/8/12.\n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (from 2013/8/13 to 2013/8/19) for each hour. This is a simple 7-day moving average per hour.\n\n Steps:\n   For hour h (0 to 23), the forecast for 2013/8/20 at hour h is:\n        (price at 2013/8/13 h + price at 2013/8/14 h + ... + price at 2013/8/19 h) / 7\n\n However, note that 2013/8/19 is a Monday and 2013/8/20 is a Tuesday. The average will include different weekdays. But without more data, it's a simple approach.\n\n But let's check the data: \n   Monday (2013/8/19) at 0:00: 32.71, Tuesday (2013/8/13) at 0:00: 32.45 -> similar? \n   But the Monday at 0:00 is 32.71 and the previous Monday (2013/8/12) is not available.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same-weekday average. We have:\n   Tuesday: only 2013/8/13\n   Wednesday: 2013/8/14\n   Thursday: 2013/8/15\n   Friday: 2013/8/16\n   Saturday: 2013/8/17\n   Sunday: 2013/8/18\n   Monday: 2013/8/19\n\n For the next Tuesday, we only have one historical Tuesday. So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This is a common approach for capturing the daily seasonality and smoothing over the week.\n\n However, note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices. Therefore, the average might be lower than a typical Tuesday. But without more data, it's a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (32.45 + 31.27 + 32.48 + 32.14 + 33.93 + 31.10 + 32.71) / 7\n Hour 1: (31.65 + 30.19 + 31.67 + 30.78 + 32.49 + 29.29 + 30.85) / 7\n ... and so on.\n\n But note: the last 7 days are from 2013/8/13 to 2013/8/19 (both inclusive). We have exactly 7 days.\n\n However, we can also consider that the most recent days might be more relevant. We can use a weighted average. For example, give more weight to the most recent days. But without a clear trend, we stick to the simple average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid outliers? But the data doesn't show extreme outliers.\n\n Let's do the simple average.\n\n But note: the problem says \"handle missing values\", but we don't have any in the provided data. So we proceed.\n\n We'll compute the average for each of the 24 hours.\n\n However, note that the data for 2013/8/18 (Sunday) had a drop at 4:00 and 5:00 (down to 21.61 and 17.73). This might be an outlier? But it's a Sunday and low demand. We include it.\n\n Steps for computation:\n\n   We have 7 values for each hour (from day1 to day7). We average them.\n\n   For example, for 0:00:\n        day1 (2013/8/13): 32.45\n        day2 (2013/8/14): 31.27\n        day3 (2013/8/15): 32.48\n        day4 (2013/8/16): 32.14\n        day5 (2013/8/17): 33.93\n        day6 (2013/8/18): 31.10\n        day7 (2013/8/19): 32.71\n        average = (32.45+31.27+32.48+32.14+33.93+31.10+32.71)/7 = 32.154285... -> round to 2 decimals: 32.15\n\n   Similarly for other hours.\n\n But note: the problem does not to omit any values, so we must provide 24 values.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model, but we are constrained by the information and the requirement to not use external data.\n\n Considering the above, I will use the 7-day average per hour.\n\n However, let's check the last day (Monday 2013/8/19) was relatively high. The next day (Tuesday) might be similar to the previous Tuesday (2013/8/13) but adjusted by the recent level. \n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). But that would be 4 days. We can try:\n\n   (Tuesday_last_week + Saturday + Sunday + Monday) / 4\n\n But without strong justification, we stick to the 7-day average.\n\n We compute the 24 averages:\n\n Hour 0: (32.45 + 31.27 + 32.48 + 32.14 + 33.93 + 31.10 + 32.71) / 7 = 32.1543 -> 32.15\n Hour 1: (31.65 + 30.19 + 31.67 + 30.78 + 32.49 + 29.29 + 30.85) / 7 = 30.9886 -> 30.99\n Hour 2: (31.10 + 29.18 + 31.37 + 30.12 + 30.83 + 26.68 + 30.63) / 7 = 28.5586 -> 28.56\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the hour 2 on 2013/8/18 (Sunday) was 26.68, which is very low. This will bring the average down. Is that appropriate for a Tuesday? We don't know.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the effect of extreme days. For hour 2:\n\n   [26.68, 29.18, 30.12, 30.63, 30.83, 31.10, 31.37] -> sorted: 26.68, 29.18, 30.12, 30.63, 30.83, 31.10, 31.37 -> median is 30.63\n\n But the problem does not specify the method. Since the data has a weekly seasonality and we are including one Sunday, which is different, the median might be better for robustness.\n\n However, the problem says \"handle missing values\", but not outliers. We are not told to handle outliers. So we can use the mean.\n\n But note: the Sunday was a valid day and the low prices might be due to low demand (weekend). The next Tuesday might not be a weekend, so including the Sunday might bias downward.\n\n Considering the trade-off, I decide to use the median for each hour. Why? Because the median is robust to outliers and we have one day (Sunday) that is very different. The median will be less affected by the extreme Sunday.\n\n Steps for median: for each hour, take the 7 values, sort them, and take the middle one (the 4th in the sorted list).\n\n Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: [31.10, 31.27, 32.14, 32.45, 32.48, 32.71, 33.93] -> sorted: 31.10, 31.27, 32.14, 32.45, 32.48, 32.71, 33.93 -> median = 32.45\n Hour 1: [29.29, 30.19, 30.78, 30.85, 31.65, 31.67, 32.49] -> sorted: 29.29, 30.19, 30.78, 30.85, 31.65, 31.67, 32.49 -> median = 30.85\n Hour 2: [26.68, 29.18, 30.12, 30.63, 30.83, 31.10, 31.37] -> sorted: 26.68, 29.18, 30.12, 30.63, 30.83, 31.10, 31.37 -> median = 30.63\n Hour 3: [22.78, 28.46, 30.09, 30.29, 30.81, 30.98, 31.21] -> sorted: 22.78, 28.46, 30.09, 30.29, 30.81, 30.98, 31.21 -> median = 30.29\n Hour 4: [17.73, 21.61, 29.01, 29.33, 29.39, 29.97, 30.94] -> wait, note: the hour 4 of 2013/8/19 is 30.81? Let me check the data:\n\n   Correction: the hour 4 of 2013/8/19 is 30.81? Actually, the data for 2013/8/19 at 4:00 is 30.81? \n   The data for 2013/8/19: \n        2013/8/19 0:00 32.71\n        2013/8/19 1:00 30.85\n        2013/8/19 2:00 30.63\n        2013/8/19 3:00 30.29\n        2013/8/19 4:00 30.81   -> yes.\n\n   So hour 4: \n        day1 (13): 30.94\n        day2 (14): 29.01\n        day3 (15): 31.47\n        day4 (16): 29.97\n        day5 (17): 29.33\n        day6 (18): 21.61\n        day7 (19): 30.81\n\n   Sorted: 21.61, 29.01, 29.33, 29.97, 30.81, 30.94, 31.47 -> median = 29.97\n\n We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note that the median might be more stable. But it only uses one value (the middle one). \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average without the min and max? But that's more complex.\n\n Given the time, I will use the median for each hour.\n\n Let's compute the median for each hour from 0 to 23:\n\n Hour 0: [31.10, 31.27, 32.14, 32.45, 32.48, 32.71, 33.93]

35.66\n20:00: 35.71\n21:00: 35.78\n22:00: 35.16\n23:00: 33.41\n\n But note: the median for hour 5 was 31.18, but the values on the weekend were very low. The Tuesday last week at hour 5 was 32.32. The Monday at hour 5 was 32.99. So 31.18 might be a bit low? But we are using the median.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the average without the min and max? But the problem does not specify.\n\n Since we are to provide a forecast and we have chosen the median, we output the above.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"short-term electricity price forecasting\" and we are an expert. We might use a more sophisticated method? But we are constrained by the data and the requirement to not use external libraries or complex training.\n\n Given the above, we output the 24 values.\n\n Format:\n\n We output the next 24 hours starting from 2013/8/20 0:00 to 2013/8/20 23:00.\n\n The answer format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2013/8/20 0:00 32.45\n        2013/8/20 1:00 30.85\n        ... \n        2013/8/20 23:00 33.41\n    </answer>\n\n But note: the median for hour 23 was 33.41? Let me check the sorted list for hour 23: \n        [32.59, 32.90, 33.40, 33.41, 33.70, 34.03, 34.05] -> the 4th element is 33.41.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the median for an odd number of observations is the middle one. There are 7, so the 4th (index 3) is the median.\n\n We output the above.\n\n But note: the problem says \"observed electricity prices\" and we are forecasting. We are not using any advanced model. This is a simple baseline.\n\n If we had more data (like multiple weeks) we could do better. But with only one week, the median per hour is a robust method.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n 2013/8/20 0:00 32.45\n 2013/8/20 1:00 30.85\n 2013/8/20 2:00 30.63\n 2013/8/20 3:00 30.29\n 2013/8/20 4:00 29.97\n 2013/8/20 5:00 31.18\n 2013/8/20 6:00 34.58\n 2013/8/20 7:00 36.90\n 2013/8/20 8:00 37.24\n 2013/8/20 9:00 37.33\n2013/8/20 10:00 37.35\n2013/8/20 11:00 37.12\n2013/8/20 12:00 36.89\n2013/8/20 13:00 36.76\n2013/8/20 14:00 36.24\n2013/8/20 15:00 35.68\n2013/8/20 16:00 35.75\n2013/8/20 17:00 35.98\n2013/8/20 18:00 35.86\n2013/8/20 19:00 35.66\n2013/8/20 20:00 35.71\n2013/8/20 21:00 35.78\n2013/8/20 22:00 35.16\n2013/8/20 23:00 33.41\n\n But wait, the median for hour 13 was 36.76? Let me double-check:\n\n   Hour 13: [31.90, 34.65, 35.90, 36.76, 36.95, 37.13, 40.16] -> the 4th is 36.76 -> correct.\n\n However, note that the median for hour 5: \n        [17.73, 19.30, 29.39, 31.18, 31.33, 32.32, 32.99] -> the 4th is 31.18 -> correct.\n\n We are done.\n",
