        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013/10/22 0:00 to 2013/10/28 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2013/10/29 0:00 to 2013/10/29 23:00).\n\nHowever, note that the problem states that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Since we don't have the other features, we must rely solely on the historical price data.\n\nGiven the complexity of electricity prices (seasonality, autocorrelation, etc.), we can use a time series model. Since we are only given 168 points (7 days) and need to forecast 24 hours, we can consider:\n\n1. The data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours).\n2. We might also consider weekly seasonality, but 7 days might be too short for that).\n\nApproach:\n- We note that the data has a daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n- We can use a simple model like a seasonal naive method (using the same hour from the previous day) or an average of the same hour over the past few days.\n\nBut note: the problem says to handle missing values. In the provided data, there are no missing values? We have 168 consecutive hours.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we can check for missing timestamps? The data seems complete.\n\nBut the problem says \"some data may contain missing values\", but in the provided snippet, we don't see any. So we assume the given data is complete.\n\nGiven the data, we can try:\n\nMethod 1: Use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days (since we have exactly 7 days) to forecast the next day.\n\nFor example, the forecast for 2013/10/29 0:00 would be the average of the prices at 0:00 for the past 7 days (from 2013/10/22 to 2013/10/28).\n\nBut note: the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's look at the days:\n\n- Weekdays (Mon to Fri) might be different from weekends (Sat, Sun).\n\nWe have:\n- 2013/10/22 (Tuesday) to 2013/10/28 (Monday) -> 7 days.\n\nSo 2013/10/29 is a Tuesday. We can compare with the previous Tuesday (2013/10/22) and also the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour, but with more weight on the same day of the previous week? However, we only have one week of data.\n\nGiven the constraints, a simple approach is to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\nBut let's check the data for the same hour across days:\n\nFor example, at hour 0:00:\n\n2013/10/22: 37.48\n2013/10/23: 34.31\n2013/10/24: 33.07\n2013/10/25: 33.67\n2013/10/26: 34.05\n2013/10/27: 33.64\n2013/10/28: 30.08\n\nAverage = (37.48+34.31+33.07+33.67+34.05+33.64+30.08)/7 = 236.3 / 7 = 33.757\n\nBut note: the last day (2013/10/28) is a Monday and the next day (2013/10/29) is a Tuesday. We might want to give more weight to the previous Tuesday (2013/10/22) and the Monday (2013/10/28) because they are adjacent? However, without more data, we stick to a simple average.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days. For example, we can give weights: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] for the last 7 days? Or increasing weights for more recent days? \n\nBut note that the prices on 2013/10/28 (Monday) are generally lower than the previous days. This might be due to a weekly pattern? \n\nGiven the limited data, we can use an exponentially weighted moving average? But we don't have a long history.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality and a trend. But with only 7 days, it's hard to capture a trend.\n\nAnother idea: use the same hour from the previous day (2013/10/28) as the forecast? But that would ignore the weekly pattern.\n\nGiven the trade-offs, I propose:\n\nWe use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days? Or the last 7 days? \n\nBut note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated method? However, without additional features (like load and wind forecasts) we are limited.\n\nGiven the data, I will use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This will capture the weekly pattern and also smooth out any daily irregularities.\n\nSo for each hour h (0 to 23) in the day, we compute:\n\nforecast_h = (price_h_day1 + price_h_day2 + ... + price_h_day7) / 7\n\nWhere day1 is 2013/10/22, day2 is 2013/10/23, ... day7 is 2013/10/28.\n\nBut note: the last day (2013/10/28) is a Monday and the day we are forecasting (2013/10/29) is a Tuesday. We have one Tuesday in the history (2013/10/22). So we might also consider using the average of the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday). \n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week over the available weeks? But we only have one week? \n\nSo we have to use the 7-day average.\n\nLet's compute the forecast for each hour:\n\nWe'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and take the average of the 7 values for that hour.\n\nBut note: the data we have is from 2013/10/22 0:00 to 2013/10/28 23:00. We have 7 days * 24 hours = 168 hours.\n\nWe can reshape the data into a 7x24 matrix and then take the mean for each column.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nHour 0: [37.48, 34.31, 33.07, 33.67, 34.05, 33.64, 30.08] -> mean = (37.48+34.31+33.07+33.67+34.05+33.64+30.08)/7 = 236.3 / 7 = 33.7571\n\nHour 1: [36.43, 33.03, 32.06, 31.81, 32.06, 33.07, 27.61] -> mean = (36.43+33.03+32.06+31.81+32.06+33.07+27.61)/7 = 226.07 / 7 = 32.2957\n\nHour 2: [35.67, 32.10, 31.52, 31.57, 31.91, 32.93, 27.48] -> mean = (35.67+32.10+31.52+31.57+31.91+32.93+27.48)/7 = 223.18 / 7 = 31.8829\n\nHour 3: [35.65, 32.09, 31.56, 32.27, 31.92, 32.71, 27.78] -> mean = (35.65+32.09+31.56+32.27+31.92+32.71+27.78)/7 = 223.98 / 7 = 32.0\n\nHour 4: [35.94, 32.81, 32.48, 33.23, 31.98, 32.81, 30.44] -> mean = (35.94+32.81+32.48+33.23+31.98+32.81+30.44)/7 = 229.69 / 7 = 32.8129\n\nHour 5: [37.71, 35.40, 35.13, 35.43, 32.27, 33.04, 33.08] -> mean = (37.71+35.40+35.13+35.43+32.27+33.04+33.08)/7 = 242.06 / 7 = 34.58\n\nHour 6: [39.65, 38.28, 37.61, 37.96, 32.89, 33.91, 35.66] -> mean = (39.65+38.28+37.61+37.96+32.89+33.91+35.66)/7 = 255.96 / 7 = 36.5657\n\nHour 7: [45.18, 40.67, 40.83, 42.96, 33.60, 34.13, 38.30] -> mean = (45.18+40.67+40.83+42.96+33.60+34.13+38.30)/7 = 275.67 / 7 = 39.3814\n\nHour 8: [47.35, 41.66, 41.17, 45.05, 35.64, 34.46, 38.08] -> mean = (47.35+41.66+41.17+45.05+35.64+34.46+38.08)/7 = 283.41 / 7 = 40.4871\n\nHour 9: [45.28, 41.10, 40.95, 42.91, 36.42, 35.03, 37.09] -> mean = (45.28+41.10+40.95+42.91+36.42+35.03+37.09)/7 = 278.78 / 7 = 39.8257\n\nHour 10: [42.90, 40.98, 39.99, 42.08, 36.08, 35.26, 37.04] -> mean = (42.90+40.98+39.99+42.08+36.08+35.26+37.04)/7 = 274.33 / 7 = 39.19\n\nHour 11: [42.01, 40.47, 38.84, 40.56, 35.17, 35.14, 36.38] -> mean = (42.01+40.47+38.84+40.56+35.17+35.14+36.38)/7 = 268.57 / 7 = 38.3671\n\nHour 12: [40.69, 39.81, 37.60, 39.48, 34.07, 35.26, 35.80] -> mean = (40.69+39.81+37.60+39.48+34.07+35.26+35.80)/7 = 262.71 / 7 = 37.53\n\nHour 13: [39.85, 38.90, 36.99, 38.16, 33.66, 34.99, 35.81] -> mean = (39.85+38.90+36.99+38.16+33.66+34.99+35.81)/7 = 258.36 / 7 = 36.9086\n\nHour 14: [39.74, 38.65, 37.42, 37.16, 33.44, 34.95, 35.84] -> mean = (39.74+38.65+37.42+37.16+33.44+34.95+35.84)/7 = 257.2 / 7 = 36.7429\n\nHour 15: [39.73, 38.58, 37.89, 37.03, 33.30, 35.03, 35.72] -> mean = (39.73+38.58+37.89+37.03+33.30+35.03+35.72)/7 = 257.28 / 7 = 36.7543\n\nHour 16: [39.76, 38.63, 38.29, 37.40, 33.40, 35.19, 36.40] -> mean = (39.76+38.63+38.29+37.40+33.40+35.19+36.40)/7 = 259.07 / 7 = 37.01\n\nHour 17: [41.42, 40.03, 40.82, 39.80, 35.10, 35.49, 37.24] -> mean = (41.42+40.03+40.82+39.80+35.10+35.49+37.24)/7 = 269.9 / 7 = 38.5571\n\nHour 18: [42.92, 40.98, 41.20, 42.60, 36.93, 35.61, 37.39] -> mean = (42.92+40.98+41.20+42.60+36.93+35.61+37.39)/7 = 277.63 / 7 = 39.6614\n\nHour 19: [42.84, 40.56, 40.69, 41.54, 37.18, 35.34, 36.01] -> mean = (42.84+40.56+40.69+41.54+37.18+35.34+36.01)/7 = 274.16 / 7 = 39.1657\n\nHour 20: [39.10, 38.55, 39.88, 37.91, 34.18, 34.44, 35.15] -> mean = (39.10+38.55+39.88+37.91+34.18+34.44+35.15)/7 = 259.21 / 7 = 37.03\n\nHour 21: [37.92, 37.49, 38.18, 35.95, 33.34, 34.99, 34.73] -> mean = (37.92+37.49+38.18+35.95+33.34+34.99+34.73)/7 = 252.6 / 7 = 36.0857\n\nHour 22: [37.00, 36.25, 37.24, 35.25, 33.09, 34.21, 33.50] -> mean = (37.00+36.25+37.24+35.25+33.09+34.21+33.50)/7 = 246.54 / 7 = 35.22\n\nHour 23: [36.02, 34.63, 35.09, 33.56, 32.70, 32.48, 32.25] -> mean = (36.02+34.63+35.09+33.56+32.70+32.48+32.25)/7 = 236.73 / 7 = 33.8186\n\nSo the forecast for 2013/10/29 from 0:00 to 23:00 would be:\n\n0:00: 33.76\n1:00: 32.30\n2:00: 31.88\n3:00: 32.00\n4:00: 32.81\n5:00: 34.58\n6:00: 36.57\n7:00: 39.38\n8:00: 40.49\n9:00: 39.83\n10:00: 39.19\n11:00: 38.37\n12:00: 37.53\n13:00: 36.91\n14:00: 36.74\n15:00: 36.75\n16:00: 37.01\n17:00: 38.56\n18:00: 39.66\n19:00: 39.17\n20:00: 37.03\n21:00: 36.09\n22:00: 35.22\n23:00: 33.82\n\nBut note: we must output the forecast in the same format as the input, with the date and time for the next 24 hours.\n\nThe last date in the historical data is 2013/10/28 23:00.

The input has two decimals. So we should output two decimals.\n\nWe'll format each number to two decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, we can output as floats with two decimals.\n\nBut the input has two decimals, so we output two decimals.\n\nSo the forecast:\n\n2013/10/29 0:00 33.76\n2013/10/29 1:00 32.30\n2013/10/29 2:00 31.88\n2013/10/29 3:00 32.00\n2013/10/29 4:00 32.81\n2013/10/29 5:00 34.58\n2013/10/29 6:00 36.57\n2013/10/29 7:00 39.38\n2013/10/29 8:00 40.49\n2013/10/29 9:00 39.83\n2013/10/29 10:00 39.19\n2013/10/29 11:00 38.37\n2013/10/29 12:00 37.53\n2013/10/29 13:00 36.91\n2013/10/29 14:00 36.74\n2013/10/29 15:00 36.75\n2013/10/29 16:00 37.01\n2013/10/29 17:00 38.56\n2013/10/29 18:00 39.66\n2013/10/29 19:00 39.17\n2013/10/29 20:00 37.03\n2013/10/29 21:00 36.09\n2013/10/29 22:00 35.22\n2013/10/29 23:00 33.82\n\nBut note: the problem says the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are not given them.
