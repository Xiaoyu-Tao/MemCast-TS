        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/12/16 0:00 to 2014/12/22 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/12/23 0:00 to 2014/12/23 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power forecasts) in the provided data, we must rely on time series forecasting methods.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but they are not provided in the historical data given. Therefore, we can only use the historical prices.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) without any missing entries. So we have a complete series.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the daily seasonality (24 hours) and the short-term nature, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends.\n\n 3. Since we are in a constrained environment (no ability to run complex models or use external libraries), we can use a simple but effective method: \n    - We can consider a seasonal naive method, but that might not capture trends well.\n    - Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour from the previous days, possibly with a weighting that gives more importance to recent days.\n\n 4. However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern? We have 7 days. But also note that the last day (2014/12/22) is a Monday? Let's check the starting day: \n    2014/12/16 is a Tuesday. So we have:\n        Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon.\n\n 5. We are forecasting for the next day: 2014/12/23, which is a Tuesday.\n\n 6. Approach: We can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., the Tuesday of the previous week: 2014/12/16) as a base, but adjust it with the recent trend.\n\n    Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for the last 7 days and then adjust by the difference between the last day and the same day a week ago.\n\n    Let:\n        h = hour of the day (0 to 23)\n        D0: 2014/12/16 (Tuesday) -> day0\n        D1: 2014/12/17 (Wednesday) -> day1\n        ...\n        D6: 2014/12/22 (Monday) -> day6\n\n        We want to forecast for D7: 2014/12/23 (Tuesday) -> same day of the week as D0.\n\n    We can compute:\n        base = the value of D0 at hour h\n        Then, we can adjust by the trend from D6 to D0? But note: D6 is Monday and D0 is Tuesday of last week.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last week (D0 to D6) and then adjust by the difference between the last two days (D6 and D5) to capture the most recent trend.\n\n    However, a more robust method is to use a weighted average of the same hour from the last few days, with more weight on the same day of the previous week and the most recent day.\n\n    Considering the day-of-week effect, we can do:\n\n        forecast(h) = (value from D0 at hour h) * w0 + (value from D1 at hour h) * w1 + ... + (value from D6 at hour h) * w6\n\n    But we want to assign weights that are higher for the same day of the previous week (D0) and also for the most recent day (D6). However, note that D0 is 7 days ago and D6 is yesterday (but a Monday, not Tuesday).\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n        forecast(h) = (value from D0 at hour h) + (value from D6 at hour h - value from D0-1 at hour h) \n        where D0-1 is the day before D0 (which we don't have).\n\n    Since we don't have data before D0, we can use the average of the same hour over the week and then adjust by the trend of the last day.\n\n    Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the same day of the last week and the same hour of the last day (D6) and then average them? \n\n    But note: the last day (Monday) and the day we are forecasting (Tuesday) might have different patterns.\n\n 7. Given the complexity and without a model, we can use a moving average with seasonality. We can use the average of the same hour for the last 3 Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (D0). \n\n 8. We can use a method that uses the last week's same day and the last day (D6) with a weight. For example:\n\n        forecast(h) = 0.5 * (value at D0, hour h) + 0.5 * (value at D6, hour h) \n\n    But note: D6 is Monday and we are forecasting Tuesday. This might not be ideal.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for all the days we have and then adjust by the difference between the last two days? \n\n    Let:\n        base = average of the same hour h over the 7 days (D0 to D6)\n        Then, we can add the trend: the average of the last 24 hours (D6) minus the average of the 24 hours of D5? \n\n    But note: we are forecasting for a Tuesday, so we might want to adjust the base by the trend from the previous day (Monday) to the current day (Tuesday) of the previous week? \n\n 10. Given the constraints, a practical approach is to use the same hour from the previous week (D0) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last 7 days. \n\n    We can compute the overall trend as the average of the last day (D6) minus the average of the day D0, and then add a proportional trend to each hour.\n\n    Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n\n        base = value at D0, hour h\n        trend = (average price of D6) - (average price of D0)\n\n        forecast(h) = base + trend * (some factor)\n\n    But note: the trend might not be linear over the week.\n\n 11. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (D4, D5, D6) and the same hour from the same day last week (D0). Then take the two averages and average them? \n\n    Let:\n        recent_avg(h) = (value at D4, h + value at D5, h + value at D6, h) / 3\n        last_week_same_day = value at D0, h\n\n        forecast(h) = (recent_avg(h) + last_week_same_day) / 2\n\n 12. We choose method 11 because it uses both the recent pattern (last 3 days) and the same day last week. The last 3 days are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday? \n        D4: 2014/12/19 (Friday)\n        D5: 2014/12/20 (Saturday)\n        D6: 2014/12/22 (Monday)   [Note: we skipped Sunday? Actually, we have D0 to D6: 7 days, so D0: Tue, D1: Wed, D2: Thu, D3: Fri? Actually, let's count:\n\n        D0: 2014/12/16 (Tue)\n        D1: 2014/12/17 (Wed)\n        D2: 2014/12/18 (Thu)\n        D3: 2014/12/19 (Fri)\n        D4: 2014/12/20 (Sat)\n        D5: 2014/12/21 (Sun)\n        D6: 2014/12/22 (Mon)\n\n        So the last 3 days: D4 (Sat), D5 (Sun), D6 (Mon). We are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n        The same day last week: D0 (Tue).\n\n        This method might be reasonable.\n\n 13. However, note that the pattern on weekends (Sat, Sun) might be different from weekdays. So we might want to use only weekdays for the recent average? But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we can use the last two weekdays? \n\n    But the last two weekdays are Friday (D3) and Monday (D6). We don't have Thursday (D2) because that was two days before Friday? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the same day last week:\n\n        forecast(h) = (value at D0, h + value at D3, h + value at D6, h) / 3\n\n    But note: D3 is Friday and D6 is Monday, which are adjacent weekdays, and D0 is Tuesday of last week.\n\n 14. Considering the above, we decide to use:\n\n        forecast(h) = (value from last Tuesday (D0) at hour h + value from last Friday (D3) at hour h + value from last Monday (D6) at hour h) / 3\n\n    Why? Because we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have a Tuesday from last week, and the two most recent weekdays (Friday and Monday) to capture the recent trend.\n\n 15. But note: the Monday (D6) is the day before the forecast day, and Friday (D3) is 4 days before. This might not be the best.\n\n 16. Another idea: use the same day last week (D0) and the day before (D6) with a weight of 0.5 each? \n\n        forecast(h) = 0.5 * (D0 at h) + 0.5 * (D6 at h)\n\n    This is simple and might capture the recent day and the weekly pattern.\n\n 17. We can also consider the average of the entire week (7 days) for that hour, but that might smooth out the daily pattern.\n\n 18. After reviewing the data, we see that the prices have a clear daily pattern (low at night, higher during the day) and also a weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends). Since we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday), we should rely more on weekdays.\n\n    We can use the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the past week? But we only have one Tuesday, one Wednesday, etc.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same hour from last week Tuesday, and then average them.\n\n 19. We decide to use:\n\n        forecast(h) = (value at D0 (last Tuesday) + value at D6 (last Monday) + value at D3 (last Friday)) / 3\n\n    But note: the Monday (D6) is the most recent day and might be the most relevant. We can give it more weight.\n\n    Let's do:\n\n        forecast(h) = 0.5 * (value at D6, h) + 0.3 * (value at D0, h) + 0.2 * (value at D3, h)\n\n    Why? Because the day before (Monday) is the most relevant, then the same day last week, then Friday.\n\n 20. However, without a rigorous way to set weights, we can stick to equal weights.\n\n 21. Let's test the method on a known point? We don't have the true value for the forecast period, but we can check the consistency.\n\n    For example, for hour 0: \n        D0: 29.86\n        D3: 29.00 (2014/12/19 0:00) -> but wait, D3 is 2014/12/19? \n        D0: 2014/12/16 -> hour0: 29.86\n        D3: 2014/12/19 -> hour0: 29.17\n        D6: 2014/12/22 -> hour0: 28.07\n\n        Average: (29.86 + 29.17 + 28.07) / 3 = 29.0333\n\n    For hour 1:\n        D0: 29.66\n        D3: 28.75\n        D6: 27.12\n        Average: (29.66+28.75+27.12)/3 = 28.51\n\n    This seems to be giving a decreasing trend, which is consistent with the last few days.\n\n 22. But note: the last Monday (D6) had a lower prices than the previous Tuesday (D0) and Friday (D3). So the average might be lower.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (excluding weekends). The last three weekdays are:\n        D2: Thursday (2014/12/18) -> but we have D2, D3, D6? \n        Actually, the weekdays in the last 7 days: \n            D0: Tuesday (weekday)\n            D1: Wednesday (weekday)\n            D2: Thursday (weekday)\n            D3: Friday (weekday)\n            D4: Saturday (weekend)\n            D5: Sunday (weekend)\n            D6: Monday (weekday)\n\n        So the last three weekdays: D6 (Monday), D3 (Friday), D2 (Thursday) -> but note that Friday and Thursday are not as recent as Monday.\n\n        We want the most recent weekdays: D6 (Monday), then D3 (Friday), then D2 (Thursday). But we are missing Tuesday and Wednesday? \n\n        We can use the last three weekdays: D6, D3, D2? \n\n        But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we also have the same day last week (D0) which is a Tuesday.\n\n        We can do: \n            forecast(h) = (D0 at h + D6 at h + D3 at h) / 3   [as before]\n\n 24. Considering the above, we will use the average of the same hour from:\n        - The same day last week (D0: 2014/12/16)\n        - The last weekday (D6: 2014/12/22, Monday)\n        - The last Friday (D3: 2014/12/19)   [which is the last Friday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday so we skip the weekend]\n\n    This gives three weekdays: one of the same type (Tuesday) and two recent weekdays (Monday and Friday).\n\n 25. We'll compute the forecast for each hour from 0 to 23 for 2014/12/23.\n\n 26. Steps for each hour h in [0,23]:\n        Let:\n            v0 = value at 2014/12/16 at hour h\n            v3 = value at 2014/12/19 at hour h\n            v6 = value at 2014/12/22 at hour h\n\n        forecast = (v0 + v3 + v6) / 3\n\n 27. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 28. Let's do an example for h=0:\n        v0 = 29.86 (2014/12/16 0:00)\n        v3 = 29.17 (2014/12/19 0:00)\n        v6 = 28.07 (2014/12/22 0:00)\n        forecast = (29.86 + 29.17 + 28.07) / 3 = 87.1 / 3 = 29.0333 -> 29.03\n\n 29. For h=1:\n        v0 = 29.66\n        v3 = 28.75\n        v6 = 27.12\n        forecast = (29.66+28.75+27.12)/3 = 85.53/3 = 28.51\n\n 30. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 31. However, note that the data for 2014/12/19 (Friday) at hour 0:00 is 29.17, but the hour 0:00 of 2014/12/19 is actually the night from Thursday to Friday? \n     But in the data, the date is given as 2014/12/19 0:00, so it is the start of Friday.\n\n 32. We proceed to compute:\n\n        Hour 0: (29.86 + 29.17 + 28.07) / 3 = 29.03\n        Hour 1: (29.66 + 28.75 + 27.12) / 3 = 28.51\n        Hour 2: (29.55 + 28.54 + 25.85) / 3 = 27.98\n        Hour 3: (29.55 + 28.29 + 25.50) / 3 = 27.78\n        Hour 4: (29.72 + 28.23 + 26.48) / 3 = 28.14\n        Hour 5: (30.07 + 28.96 + 28.28) / 3 = 29.10\n        Hour 6: (30.88 + 30.20 + 29.52) / 3 = 30.20\n        Hour 7: (32.40 + 31.91 + 30.19) / 3 = 31.50\n        Hour 8: (32.96 + 32.34 + 30.39) / 3 = 31.90\n        Hour 9: (32.94 + 31.87 + 30.38) / 3 = 31.73\n        Hour 10: (32.60 + 31.53 + 30.29) / 3 = 31.47\n        Hour 11: (32.20 + 31.15 + 30.15) / 3 = 31.17\n        Hour 12: (32.03 + 31.11 + 30.13) / 3 = 31.09\n        Hour 13: (32.13 + 30.79 + 30.18) / 3 = 31.03\n        Hour 14: (32.52 + 30.82 + 30.33) / 3 = 31.22\n        Hour 15: (32.93 + 30.88 + 30.44) / 3 = 31.42\n        Hour 16: (33.28 + 31.06 + 30.53) / 3 = 31.62\n        Hour 17: (33.01 + 31.41 + 30.56) / 3 = 31.66\n        Hour 18: (32.64 + 31.03 + 30.42) / 3 = 31.36\n        Hour 19: (31.73 + 30.59 + 30.13) / 3 = 30.82\n        Hour 20: (30.93 + 30.10 + 29.84) / 3 = 30.29\n        Hour 21: (30.66 + 29.95 + 29.58) / 3 = 30.06\n        Hour 22: (30.33 + 29.65 + 29.08) / 3 = 29.69\n        Hour 23: (29.91 + 29.00 + 28.25) / 3 = 29.05\n\n 33. But note: the data for 2014/12/19 hour 23:00 is 29.00? Actually, in the data for 2014/12/19:\n        2014/12/19 23:00 29.00\n\n 34. We have the forecast for 2014/12/23 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 35. We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n 36. However, note that the problem says we must handle missing values, but there are none. So we are safe.\n\n 37. We write the forecast for 2014/12/23 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 38.
