        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/3/4 0:00 to 2014/3/10 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/3/11 0:00 to 2014/3/11 23:00.\n\n However, note that the data provided does not have any missing values in the given time period. We can observe a clear daily pattern (diurnal) and also a weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n Since we are only provided with the historical prices and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts for the future), we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical price.\n\n Given the requirement for short-term forecasting (24 hours ahead) and the presence of multiple seasonality (daily and weekly), we can use a model that captures these patterns.\n\n Approach:\n 1. We note that the data has 24-hour seasonality (daily pattern) and also a weekly pattern (7 days). However, for a 24-hour forecast, the daily pattern is the most critical.\n\n 2. We can use a simple approach: take the average of the same hour from the last few days (e.g., the same hour from the previous day, the day before that, etc.) and adjust for the weekly pattern.\n\n 3. Since the data includes both weekdays and weekends, and the next day (2014/3/11) is a Tuesday (as 2014/3/10 is Monday), we can look at the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2014/3/4) and also the immediate past days (Monday, 2014/3/10; Sunday, 2014/3/9; Saturday, 2014/3/8; etc.)\n\n 4. However, note that the price pattern on weekdays is different from weekends. Therefore, we might give more weight to the same weekday.\n\n 5. We can use a weighted average of the same hour from:\n    - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2014/3/4) \n    - The most recent days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday, etc.) but with decreasing weights as we go further in the past.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a moving window of the last 3 weekdays (since 2014/3/11 is a Tuesday, we can use the last three Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the data: 2014/3/4). So we have limited data.\n\n 7. Given the data (only 7 days, and we have one Tuesday and one Monday, etc.), we can do:\n\n    For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2014/3/11, Tuesday):\n        Let:\n          d0: same hour h on the previous day (Monday, 2014/3/10)\n          d1: same hour h on the same day last week (Tuesday, 2014/3/4)\n          d2: same hour h on the day two weeks ago? (but we don't have that)\n\n    Since we only have one week of data, we can use:\n        forecast_h = (w0 * d0 + w1 * d1) / (w0 + w1)\n\n    Weights: we can assign more weight to the most recent day (Monday) and less to the same day last week.\n\n    For example, w0 = 0.7, w1 = 0.3.\n\n 8. But note: the price on Monday (2014/3/10) and the previous Tuesday (2014/3/4) might be different in terms of overall level. We can adjust by the average of the day.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the same hour of the previous day (Monday) as the forecast for Tuesday? But that ignores the weekly pattern.\n\n 9. Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) but note that Friday (2014/3/7) and Thursday (2014/3/6) are also weekdays. However, we don't have Friday in the same week? Actually, we have:\n\n    Weekdays in the data:\n        Tuesday (2014/3/4)\n        Wednesday (2014/3/5)\n        Thursday (2014/3/6)\n        Friday (2014/3/7)\n        Monday (2014/3/10)   [skipping weekend: Saturday and Sunday]\n\n    So for the forecast (Tuesday 2014/3/11), we can use:\n\n        - The same hour from Monday (2014/3/10) -> most recent weekday\n        - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014/3/4) -> same weekday\n\n    We can also include the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday of the same week? But note that the next day is Tuesday, so we might be more similar to Monday and the previous Tuesday.\n\n 10. We can use a simple average of the same hour from the last two weekdays that are the same day of the week (i.e., Tuesdays) but we only have one. So we can use:\n\n        forecast_h = (d0 * 0.6 + d1 * 0.4)   [if we have only two points]\n\n     But we can also the same hour? Actually, we have more: we can use the same hour from the last three weekdays? However, the pattern on Monday (the day before) is very relevant.\n\n 11. Considering the above, we can use:\n\n        forecast_h = (3 * d0 + 1 * d1) / 4.0\n\n     meaning we give 3 times the weight to the immediate past day (Monday) and 1 time to the same day last week (Tuesday).\n\n 12. However, we can also look at the overall trend? The data shows a general decrease in prices over the week? But the last day (Monday) was a bit higher than the weekend.\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the daily profile and adjust by the average level of the last day.\n\n 14. Let's compute the average price for the last day (Monday, 2014/3/10) and the average for the same day last week (Tuesday, 2014/3/4):\n\n        Monday (2014/3/10): \n            average = (24.26+22.62+22.73+22.76+23.29+25.75+27.17+27.79+28.28+28.03+27.90+27.75+27.37+27.33+27.34+27.24+27.14+27.61+28.21+28.02+27.58+27.30+26.80+25.93) / 24\n            = (let's calculate: \n                24.26+22.62=46.88, +22.73=69.61, +22.76=92.37, +23.29=115.66, +25.75=141.41, +27.17=168.58, +27.79=196.37, +28.28=224.65, +28.03=252.68, \n                27.90=280.58, 27.75=308.33, 27.37=335.7, 27.33=363.03, 27.34=390.37, 27.24=417.61, 27.14=444.75, 27.61=472.36, 28.21=500.57, 28.02=528.59, \n                27.58=556.17, 27.30=583.47, 26.80=610.27, 25.93=636.2\n                ) -> 636.2 / 24 = 26.50833\n\n        Tuesday (2014/3/4):\n            average = (27.90+27.77+27.63+27.93+28.32+28.75+29.75+32.25+34.91+34.92+33.83+32.18+31.34+30.52+30.11+30.02+30.17+32.80+34.99+32.54+29.91+29.11+28.62+28.35) / 24\n            = (27.90+27.77=55.67, +27.63=83.3, +27.93=111.23, +28.32=139.55, +28.75=168.3, +29.75=198.05, +32.25=230.3, +34.91=265.21, +34.92=300.13, \n               33.83=333.96, 32.18=366.14, 31.34=397.48, 30.52=428.0, 30.11=458.11, 30.02=488.13, 30.17=518.3, 32.80=551.1, 34.99=586.09, 32.54=618.63, \n               29.91=648.54, 29.11=677.65, 28.62=706.27, 28.35=734.62) -> 734.62 / 24 = 30.6091667\n\n        The average on Monday (26.5) is lower than the previous Tuesday (30.6). So we might adjust the previous Tuesday's profile down by the ratio? \n\n        But note: we are forecasting for Tuesday 2014/3/11. We can adjust the previous Tuesday's data by the ratio of the Monday's average to the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week (2014/3/3). \n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 7 days to adjust the level? \n\n 16. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only asked for 24 hours, we don't have exogenous variables, we will use a simple weighted average of the same hour from the last two weekdays: the immediate past day (Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). Weights: 0.6 for Monday and 0.4 for Tuesday.\n\n    So for hour h (0..23) on 2014/3/11:\n\n        forecast_h = 0.6 * (price of hour h on 2014/3/10) + 0.4 * (price of hour h on 2014/3/4)\n\n 17. But note: the data for 2014/3/4 (Tuesday) and 2014/3/10 (Monday) are both available.\n\n 18. Let's compute the forecast for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: 0.6 * 24.26 + 0.4 * 27.90 = 0.6*24.26 = 14.556, 0.4*27.90=11.16 -> 25.716\n        Hour 1: 0.6 * 22.62 + 0.4 * 27.77 = 13.572 + 11.108 = 24.68\n        ... and so on.\n\n 19. However, we must consider that the day of the week matters. The previous Tuesday (2014/3/4) was a weekday and the next day (2014/3/11) is also a weekday. The Monday (2014/3/10) is also a weekday. So using both is reasonable.\n\n 20. But note: the pattern on Monday and Tuesday might be different? For example, Tuesday might have higher demand? We don't have data to support that. So we use the same weights for all hours.\n\n 21. We'll compute the 24 values accordingly.\n\n 22. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated method: STL decomposition or exponential smoothing, but without a library and with only 168 points, we stick to simplicity.\n\n 23. Let's calculate:\n\n        Hour 0: 0.6 * 24.26 + 0.4 * 27.90 = 14.556 + 11.16 = 25.716 -> 25.72 (rounded to two decimals as in the input)\n        Hour 1: 0.6 * 22.62 + 0.4 * 27.77 = 13.572 + 11.108 = 24.68\n        Hour 2: 0.6 * 22.73 + 0.4 * 27.63 = 13.638 + 11.052 = 24.69\n        Hour 3: 0.6 * 22.76 + 0.4 * 27.93 = 13.656 + 11.172 = 24.828 -> 24.83\n        Hour 4: 0.6 * 23.29 + 0.4 * 28.32 = 13.974 + 11.328 = 25.302 -> 25.30\n        Hour 5: 0.6 * 25.75 + 0.4 * 28.75 = 15.45 + 11.5 = 26.95\n        Hour 6: 0.6 * 27.17 + 0.4 * 29.75 = 16.302 + 11.9 = 28.202 -> 28.20\n        Hour 7: 0.6 * 27.79 + 0.4 * 32.25 = 16.674 + 12.9 = 29.574 -> 29.57\n        Hour 8: 0.6 * 28.28 + 0.4 * 34.91 = 16.968 + 13.964 = 30.932 -> 30.93\n        Hour 9: 0.6 * 28.03 + 0.4 * 34.92 = 16.818 + 13.968 = 30.786 -> 30.79\n        Hour 10: 0.6 * 27.90 + 0.4 * 33.83 = 16.74 + 13.532 = 30.272 -> 30.27\n        Hour 11: 0.6 * 27.75 + 0.4 * 32.18 = 16.65 + 12.872 = 29.522 -> 29.52\n        Hour 12: 0.6 * 27.37 + 0.4 * 31.34 = 16.422 + 12.536 = 28.958 -> 28.96\n        Hour 13: 0.6 * 27.33 + 0.4 * 30.52 = 16.398 + 12.208 = 28.606 -> 28.61\n        Hour 14: 0.6 * 27.34 + 0.4 * 30.11 = 16.404 + 12.044 = 28.448 -> 28.45\n        Hour 15: 0.6 * 27.24 + 0.4 * 30.02 = 16.344 + 12.008 = 28.352 -> 28.35\n        Hour 16: 0.6 * 27.14 + 0.4 * 30.17 = 16.284 + 12.068 = 28.352 -> 28.35\n        Hour 17: 0.6 * 27.61 + 0.4 * 32.80 = 16.566 + 13.12 = 29.686 -> 29.69\n        Hour 18: 0.6 * 28.21 + 0.4 * 34.99 = 16.926 + 13.996 = 30.922 -> 30.92\n        Hour 19: 0.6 * 28.02 + 0.4 * 32.54 = 16.812 + 13.016 = 29.828 -> 29.83\n        Hour 20: 0.6 * 27.58 + 0.4 * 29.91 = 16.548 + 11.964 = 28.512 -> 28.51\n        Hour 21: 0.6 * 27.30 + 0.4 * 29.11 = 16.38 + 11.644 = 28.024 -> 28.02\n        Hour 22: 0.6 * 26.80 + 0.4 * 28.62 = 16.08 + 11.448 = 27.528 -> 27.53\n        Hour 23: 0.6 * 25.93 + 0.4 * 28.35 = 15.558 + 11.34 = 26.898 -> 26.90\n\n 24. However, note that the last day (Monday) had a lower average than the previous Tuesday. This forecast might be a bit low? But we are using 60% of the recent day and 40% of the same day last week.\n\n 25. We'll output the forecast for 2014/3/11 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 26. Format: \n        date and time: \"2014/3/11 0:00\", \"2014/3/11 1:00\", ... \"2014/3/11 23:00\"\n\n 27. We write the forecasted prices with two decimal places.\n\n 28. The answer must be in the format:\n\n        <answer>\n          2014/3/11 0:00 25.72\n          2014/3/11 1:00 24.68\n          ... \n        </answer>\n\n 29. Let's write the full 24 hours:\n\n        Hour 0: 25.72\n        Hour 1: 24.68\n        Hour 2: 24.69\n        Hour 3: 24.83\n        Hour 4: 25.30\n        Hour 5: 26.95\n        Hour 6: 28.20\n        Hour 7: 29.57\n        Hour 8: 30.93\n        Hour 9: 30.79\n        Hour 10: 30.27\n        Hour 11: 29.52\n        Hour 12: 28.96\n        Hour 13: 28.61\n        Hour 14: 28.45\n        Hour 15: 28.35\n        Hour 16: 28.35\n        Hour 17: 29.69\n        Hour 18: 30.92\n        Hour 19: 29.83\n        Hour 20: 28.51\n        Hour 21: 28.02\n        Hour 22: 27.53\n        Hour 23: 26.90\n\n 30. We output the above.\n\n Note: This is a simple heuristic. In practice, one might use more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, etc.) but given the constraints, we use a weighted average.\n\n However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but there are no missing values in the provided data. So we proceed.\n",
