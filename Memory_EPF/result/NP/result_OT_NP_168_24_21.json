        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2013/5/28 0:00 to 2013/6/3 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2013/6/4 0:00 to 2013/6/4 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily and weekly seasonality. However, note that the data is only for 7 days, so we can capture daily patterns but weekly patterns might be harder.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple model that captures the daily seasonality. One common approach is to use the average of the same hour in the past few days. Since we have 7 days of data, we can take the average of the same hour for the last 7 days (if available) or a subset.\n\n However, note that the last day (2013/6/3) is a Monday? Let's check the dates:\n  2013/5/28: Tuesday\n  2013/5/29: Wednesday\n  2013/5/30: Thursday\n  2013/5/31: Friday\n  2013/6/1: Saturday\n  2013/6/2: Sunday\n  2013/6/3: Monday\n\n We are to forecast for 2013/6/4, which is a Tuesday.\n\n Therefore, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2013/5/28) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n But note: the data shows a general downward trend over the week? Let's see:\n\n We can also use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, without more data, a simple method is to use the average of the same hour of the same day of the week (i.e., Tuesday) and the immediate past day (Monday) to account for the most recent pattern.\n\n Proposed method:\n For each hour h (0 to 23) on 2013/6/4 (Tuesday), we can compute:\n   forecast_h = (value of hour h on the previous Tuesday (2013/5/28) + value of hour h on the immediate past day (Monday, 2013/6/3)) / 2\n\n Why this? Because we have only one Tuesday in the data and the Monday is the most recent day. This gives equal weight to the same day last week and the day before.\n\n However, we note that the week has 7 days and the pattern might be different. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include weekends which have different patterns.\n\n Considering the day of the week, we can do:\n\n   Tuesday: 2013/5/28 (the only Tuesday in the data)\n   Monday: 2013/6/3 (the day before the forecast day)\n\n But note: the forecast day is Tuesday, so we have one historical Tuesday and the Monday (which is the day before). We might also consider the previous Monday? But we don't have it (the data starts on Tuesday).\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) and take an average? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Since we have limited data, let's use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days and the same day last week.\n\n We can try:\n   forecast_h = (w1 * value_h_last_tuesday + w2 * value_h_monday + w3 * value_h_sunday + w4 * value_h_saturday) / (w1+w2+w3+w4)\n\n But note: the pattern on weekends might be different. Since the forecast day is a Tuesday, we expect it to be more similar to the previous Tuesday and the Monday (which is a weekday) than the weekend.\n\n Therefore, we can give higher weights to the previous Tuesday and the Monday.\n\n Let's assign:\n   w1 (last Tuesday) = 0.5\n   w2 (Monday) = 0.5\n   and ignore the weekend? Or we can use the Monday and Tuesday only.\n\n Since we have only one week of data, and the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices, but Tuesday is a weekday, we might not want to include the weekend.\n\n So, we'll use: \n   forecast_h = (value_h_2013_05_28 + value_h_2013_06_03) / 2\n\n But note: 2013/5/28 is the same day of the week (Tuesday) and 2013/6/3 is Monday (the day before). \n\n However, we can also consider the trend: the prices on 2013/6/3 (Monday) are generally lower than on 2013/5/28 (Tuesday). So we might adjust by the overall trend? \n\n Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for all the weekdays we have? We have:\n   Tuesday (2013/5/28), Wednesday (2013/5/29), Thursday (2013/5/30), Friday (2013/5/31), and Monday (2013/6/3). \n   But note: we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we can take the average of the same hour on the weekdays? However, the pattern might be different for each day.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only one Tuesday, we stick to the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday and the previous day (Monday).\n\n Let's test with a few hours:\n\n Example for hour 0:00:\n   Last Tuesday (2013/5/28 0:00): 35.63\n   Monday (2013/6/3 0:00): 31.57\n   Forecast: (35.63 + 31.57) / 2 = 33.60\n\n But note: the last Monday (2013/6/3) is the day before, and the Tuesday a week ago. We can also see that the price at 0:00 has been declining over the week? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last day (Monday) same hour? But that would ignore the weekly pattern.\n\n We'll go with the average of the same day last week and the day before.\n\n However, to account for the possibility of a trend, we can also consider the previous Tuesday by adjusting it with the overall change from last week to this week? \n\n But without more data, we'll use the simple average.\n\n Let's compute for all 24 hours:\n\n We'll create two arrays:\n   tuesday_hours = [35.63, 33.18, 32.08, ... , 34.87]  # from 2013/5/28 0:00 to 23:00 -> 23:00 was 34.95? Actually, the last hour of 2013/5/28 is 23:00: 34.95\n\n   monday_hours = [31.57, 28.55, 27.48, ... , 34.87]  # from 2013/6/3 0:00 to 23:00 -> the last hour of 2013/6/3 is 23:00: 34.87\n\n Then, for hour i in 0..23:\n      forecast[i] = (tuesday_hours[i] + monday_hours[i]) / 2\n\n But note: the data for 2013/6/3 (Monday) is the last 24 hours of the given data? Actually, the last 24 hours of the data are for 2013/6/3 (from 0:00 to 23:00). And the Tuesday data is the first 24 hours.\n\n Let's extract:\n\n   Tuesday (2013/5/28): indices 0 to 23\n   Monday (2013/6/3): indices 144 to 167 (since 7 days * 24 = 168, so the last day is index 144 to 167)\n\n Alternatively, we can note that the data is in order, so:\n\n   Tuesday (2013/5/28): the first 24 records (index 0 to 23)\n   Monday (2013/6/3): the last 24 records (index 144 to 167)\n\n Steps:\n\n   hour0: (data[0] + data[144]) / 2\n   hour1: (data[1] + data[145]) / 2\n   ...\n   hour23: (data[23] + data[167]) / 2\n\n But note: the data for Monday (2013/6/3) is from index 144 to 167? Let's count:\n\n   Total 168 records: \n        index 0: 2013/5/28 0:00\n        index 1: 2013/5/28 1:00\n        ...\n        index 23: 2013/5/28 23:00 -> Tuesday\n        index 24: 2013/5/29 0:00 -> Wednesday\n        ...\n        index 167: 2013/6/3 23:00 -> Monday\n\n So the Monday data is indeed from index 144 (which is 144/24 = 6 days after the start, so day 6: 2013/5/28 + 6 days = 2013/6/3) to index 167.\n\n Therefore, we can compute:\n\n   forecast_hour] = (historical[hour] + historical[hour + 144]) / 2   for hour in 0..23\n\n However, we must note that the data for the same hour might be affected by other factors. But without more data, this is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n Let's compute the 24 forecasts:\n\n   Hour 0: (35.63 + 31.57) / 2 = 33.60\n   Hour 1: (33.18 + 28.55) / 2 = 30.865\n   Hour 2: (32.08 + 27.48) / 2 = 29.78\n   Hour 3: (30.69 + 26.14) / 2 = 28.415\n   Hour 4: (31.47 + 28.88) / 2 = 30.175\n   Hour 5: (34.41 + 32.54) / 2 = 33.475\n   Hour 6: (39.86 + 37.26) / 2 = 38.56\n   Hour 7: (43.07 + 39.99) / 2 = 41.53\n   Hour 8: (43.57 + 41.76) / 2 = 42.665\n   Hour 9: (43.01 + 41.92) / 2 = 42.465\n   Hour 10: (42.47 + 42.97) / 2 = 42.72\n   Hour 11: (41.78 + 43.75) / 2 = 42.765\n   Hour 12: (40.91 + 42.24) / 2 = 41.575\n   Hour 13: (39.94 + 40.90) / 2 = 40.42\n   Hour 14: (39.91 + 39.28) / 2 = 39.595\n   Hour 15: (40.07 + 38.71) / 2 = 39.39\n   Hour 16: (40.08 + 38.41) / 2 = 39.245\n   Hour 17: (40.62 + 38.11) / 2 = 39.365\n   Hour 18: (40.25 + 38.29) / 2 = 39.27\n   Hour 19: (39.96 + 38.68) / 2 = 39.32\n   Hour 20: (39.83 + 38.38) / 2 = 39.105\n   Hour 21: (39.56 + 38.31) / 2 = 38.935\n   Hour 22: (38.98 + 37.89) / 2 = 38.435\n   Hour 23: (34.95 + 34.87) / 2 = 34.91\n\n But note: the last value of Monday (2013/6/3) is 34.87? Yes, at 23:00.\n\n However, we must consider that the data might have a trend. The prices on Monday (2013/6/3) are generally lower than the previous Tuesday (2013/5/28). Therefore, our forecast for the next Tuesday might be a bit lower than the previous Tuesday.\n\n This method is simple and leverages both the weekly pattern and the most recent day.\n\n We'll output the forecast for 2013/6/4 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n Format:\n\n   2013/6/4 0:00 <forecast>\n   2013/6/4 1:00 <forecast>\n   ...\n\n We'll write the forecasted values with two decimal places.\n\n However, note: the problem says the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are not given that data for the future. So we cannot use them. We are only given the historical prices.\n\n Therefore, we proceed with the above.\n\n Let's write the forecast:\n\n  0:00: 33.60\n  1:00: 30.87\n  2:00: 29.78\n  3:00: 28.42\n  4:00: 30.18\n  5:00: 33.48\n  6:00: 38.56\n  7:00: 41.53\n  8:00: 42.67\n  9:00: 42.47\n 10:00: 42.72\n 11:00: 42.77\n 12:00: 41.58\n 13:00: 40.42\n 14:00: 39.60\n 15:00: 39.39\n 16:00: 39.25\n 17:00: 39.37\n 18:00: 39.27\n 19:00: 39.32\n 20:00: 39.11\n 21:00: 38.94\n 22:00: 38.44\n 23:00: 34.91\n\n But note: we rounded to two decimals. The original data had two decimals.\n\n However, in the calculation for hour1: (33.18+28.55)=61.73 -> 61.73/2=30.865 -> rounded to 30.87.\n\n We'll round to two decimals.\n\n Let me recast the calculations with rounding:\n\n  0: (35.63 + 31.57) / 2 = 67.20 / 2 = 33.60\n  1: (33.18 + 28.55) / 2 = 61.73 / 2 = 30.865 -> 30.87\n  2: (32.08 + 27.48) / 2 = 59.56 / 2 = 29.78\n  3: (30.69 + 26.14) / 2 = 56.83 / 2 = 28.415 -> 28.42\n  4: (31.47 + 28.88) / 2 = 60.35 / 2 = 30.175 -> 30.18\n  5: (34.41 + 32.54) / 2 = 66.95 / 2 = 33.475 -> 33.48\n  6: (39.86 + 37.26) / 2 = 77.12 / 2 = 38.56\n  7: (43.07 + 39.99) / 2 = 83.06 / 2 = 41.53\n  8: (43.57 + 41.76) / 2 = 85.33 / 2 = 42.665 -> 42.67\n  9: (43.01 + 41.92) / 2 = 84.93 / 2 = 42.465 -> 42.47\n 10: (42.47 + 42.97) / 2 = 85.44 / 2 = 42.72\n 11: (41.78 + 43.75) / 2 = 85.53 / 2 = 42.765 -> 42.77\n 12: (40.91 + 42.24) / 2 = 83.15 / 2 = 41.575 -> 41.58\n 13: (39.94 + 40.90) / 2 = 80.84 / 2 = 40.42\n 14: (39.91 + 39.28) / 2 = 79.19 / 2 = 39.595 -> 39.60\n 15: (40.07 + 38.71) / 2 = 78.78 / 2 = 39.39\n 16: (40.08 + 38.41) / 2 = 78.49 / 2 = 39.245 -> 39.25\n 17: (40.62 + 38.11) / 2 = 78.73 / 2 = 39.365 -> 39.37\n 18: (40.25 + 38.29) / 2 = 78.54 / 2 = 39.27\n 19: (39.96 + 38.68) / 2 = 78.64 / 2 = 39.32\n 20: (39.83 + 38.38) / 2 = 78.21 / 2 = 39.105 -> 39.11\n 21: (39.56 + 38.31) / 2 = 77.87 / 2 = 38.935 -> 38.94\n 22: (38.98 + 37.89) / 2 = 76.87 / 2 = 38.435 -> 38.44\n 23: (34.95 + 34.87) / 2 = 69.82 / 2 = 34.91\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2013/6/4:\n\n   0:00: 33.60\n   1:00: 30.87\n   2:00: 29.78\n   3:00: 28.42\n   4:00: 30.18\n   5:00: 33.48\n   6:00: 38.56\n   7:00: 41.53\n   8:00: 42.67\n   9:00: 42.47\n  10:00: 42.72\n  11:00: 42.77\n  12:00: 41.58\n  13:00: 40.42\n  14:00: 39.60\n  15:00: 39.39\n  16:00: 39.25\n  17:00: 39.37\n  18:00: 39.27\n  19:00: 39.32\n  20:00: 39.11\n  21:00: 38.94\n  22:00: 38.44\n  23:00: 34.91\n\n We output in the required format.\n",
