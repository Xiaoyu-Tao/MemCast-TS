        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-03-25 00:00 to 2014-03-31 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014-04-01 00:00 to 2014-04-01 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) without any missing entries. So no imputation is needed.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, capturing weekly seasonality might be challenging.\n\n 4. We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: Seasonal Naive, where we forecast each hour by the same hour of the previous day (or same day of the previous week). Since we have exactly one week of data, we can use the same day of the previous week? But note: the data is from Tuesday (2014-03-25) to Monday (2014-03-31). The next day (2014-04-01) is a Tuesday. So we can use the data from Tuesday (2014-03-25) as a template? However, note that the pattern might change due to weekly seasonality (weekday vs weekend). But our last week includes a weekend (29th and 30th are Saturday and Sunday). \n\n 25th (Tue), 26th (Wed), 27th (Thu), 28th (Fri), 29th (Sat), 30th (Sun), 31st (Mon). Then 1st of April is Tuesday.\n\n Therefore, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014-03-25, which is a Tuesday) to forecast 2014-04-01 (also Tuesday). However, note that the data from 2014-03-25 is 7 days ago and the market conditions might have changed. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last few Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without more data, the simplest is to use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014-03-25) for the forecast of 2014-04-01.\n\n However, let's look at the data: the week from 25th to 31st shows a pattern of weekdays (higher during the day) and lower on Saturday and Sunday. The next Tuesday (April 1) should be similar to the previous Tuesday (March 25). But note that the overall level might be different? We can adjust by the recent trend.\n\n Approach:\n  - Compute the average of the last 7 days (the entire week) and the average of the previous week (but we don't have the week before March 25). So we cannot compute a trend over multiple weeks.\n\n  - Alternatively, we can use the last week's Tuesday (March 25) as a base and then adjust by the overall change from the previous Tuesday to the most recent day (Monday, March 31) in the same hour? That might be too noisy.\n\n  - Another idea: use the average of the last 24 hours (March 31) and the same day last week (March 25) to adjust. But without more data, it's hard.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose a simple method: use the same hour of the same day of the previous week (i.e., March 25) as the forecast for April 1. This is a seasonal naive method with seasonality=7 days.\n\n However, note that the data shows a slight downward trend? Let's check the average of the first day (March 25) and the last day (March 31):\n   March 25: average = (26.03+25.77+...+24.36)/24 = 27.00 (approx)\n   March 31: average = (27.37+27.24+...+27.79)/24 = 29.50 (approx) -> actually higher.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire week and then adjust the base day by the ratio of the last week's average to the base week's average? But we don't have a full week of the same week type? Actually, we have one full week.\n\n Since we are only forecasting one day (24 hours) and the data is limited, we'll use the same day of the previous week (March 25) as the forecast for April 1.\n\n But note: the last day (March 31, Monday) is higher than the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday. So we cannot adjust.\n\n Therefore, we output the values from 2014-03-25 for the next 24 hours (2014-04-01) as the forecast.\n\n However, let me check: the data for 2014-03-25 is:\n\n 2014/3/25 0:00 26.030\n 2014/3/25 1:00 25.770\n 2014/3/25 2:00 25.710\n 2014/3/25 3:00 25.910\n 2014/3/25 4:00 26.200\n 2014/3/25 5:00 27.300\n 2014/3/25 6:00 28.380\n 2014/3/25 7:00 31.440\n 2014/3/25 8:00 32.900\n 2014/3/25 9:00 31.070\n 2014/3/25 10:00 29.890\n 2014/3/25 11:00 28.490\n 2014/3/25 12:00 27.650\n 2014/3/25 13:00 27.040\n 2014/3/25 14:00 26.550\n 2014/3/25 15:00 26.420\n 2014/3/25 16:00 26.280\n 2014/3/25 17:00 26.730\n 2014/3/25 18:00 26.950\n 2014/3/25 19:00 26.950\n 2014/3/25 20:00 26.460\n 2014/3/25 21:00 25.930\n 2014/3/25 22:00 25.300\n 2014/3/25 23:00 24.360\n\n We will use these 24 values as the forecast for 2014-04-01 00:00 to 2014-04-01 23:00.\n\n But note: the problem says \"observed electricity prices\" and we are only given the OT (observed) and no other features. So we cannot use a model that requires exogenous variables.\n\n However, we must consider that the last week's Tuesday might be too old. We can try to adjust by the recent trend. For example, we can compute the average of the entire week (168 hours) and the average of the base week (March 25 to March 31) and then adjust the base day by the ratio? But note: the base week is the same as the entire week? We only have one week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last 24 hours (March 31) and the base day (March 25) to compute a scaling factor? But that might not be robust.\n\n Given the simplicity and the data constraints, I will use the same day of the previous week without adjustment.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014-04-01 00:00 to 2014-04-01 23:00) is the same as the values from 2014-03-25.\n\n But note: the problem says \"short-term electricity price forecasting\" and we are an expert. We might consider a more sophisticated method if we had more data. However, with only one week, we cannot train a complex model.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing. But the seasonal naive is a standard baseline for seasonal data.\n\n Let me try to see if there is a trend: from March 25 to March 31, the prices seem to have increased. We can compute the average for each day:\n\n  March 25: average = 27.00 (approx) -> let me calculate exactly:\n      sum = 26.03+25.77+25.71+25.91+26.20+27.30+28.38+31.44+32.90+31.07+29.89+28.49+27.65+27.04+26.55+26.42+26.28+26.73+26.95+26.95+26.46+25.93+25.30+24.36 =  Let me compute step by step:\n\n  We can also note that the last day (March 31) has an average of about 29.5. The base day (March 25) is 27.00. The overall level has increased by about 9.26% (29.5/27.00). So we can adjust the base day by this factor? \n\n  However, the entire week's average is: \n      (March25: 27.00, March26: 27.80, March27: 28.00, March28: 28.20, March29: 27.20, March30: 26.90, March31: 29.50) -> average of these averages = (27+27.8+28+28.2+27.2+26.9+29.5)/7 = 27.94\n\n  The base week (if we had the previous week) is not available. So we cannot compute a trend.\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute the average of the entire week (168 hours) and the average of the base day (24 hours) and then adjust the base day by the ratio of the entire week's average to the base day's average? That doesn't make sense.\n\n  Another idea: use the average of the last 7 days (the entire week) and the average of the same day last week (which is the base day) to adjust. But the entire week is the same as the week we have? So the entire week's average is 27.94 and the base day's average is 27.00. Then the ratio = 27.94/27.00 = 1.035. Then we can multiply the base day by 1.035 to get the forecast.\n\n  But note: the base day is part of the entire week, so we are using the same data twice.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 6 days (excluding the base day) and compare to the base day? Then the average of the last 6 days: (27.8+28+28.2+27.2+26.9+29.5)/6 = 27.93. Then the ratio = 27.93 / 27.00 = 1.034. Then we adjust the base day by 1.034.\n\n  But this is a very rough adjustment.\n\n  However, without more data, we choose the simple seasonal naive without adjustment.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"handle missing values\", but there are none. So we are safe.\n\n  Considering the above, I will use the base day (March 25) values as the forecast, but adjusted by the overall trend of the week. The trend can be estimated by the difference between the last day (March 31) and the base day (March 25). The average of March 31 is 29.5 and March 25 is 27.0, so an increase of 2.5. We can add 2.5 to each hour? Or use a multiplicative factor? \n\n  Since the increase is not linear, we can try additive: \n      forecast = base_day_value + (average_last_day - average_base_day)\n\n  But that would add 2.5 to every hour, which might not be accurate.\n\n  Alternatively, multiplicative: \n      forecast = base_day_value * (average_last_day / average_base_day) = base_day_value * (29.5/27.0) \u2248 base_day_value * 1.0926\n\n  However, the multiplicative factor might be too aggressive.\n\n  Let me check the last 7 days: the prices on the last day (March 31) are generally higher than the base day (March 25) at the same hour? \n\n  Example: \n      Hour 0: 27.37 vs 26.03 -> +1.34\n      Hour 1: 27.24 vs 25.77 -> +1.47\n      Hour 2: 27.02 vs 25.71 -> +1.31\n      Hour 7: 33.32 vs 31.44 -> +1.88\n      Hour 8: 34.15 vs 32.90 -> +1.25\n\n  The increase is not constant. But the multiplicative factor: \n      Hour0: 27.37 / 26.03 \u2248 1.051\n      Hour1: 27.24 / 25.77 \u2248 1.057\n      Hour2: 27.02 / 25.71 \u2248 1.051\n\n  The multiplicative factor is around 1.05, not 1.09. Why? Because the average of the base day is 27.0 and the last day is 29.5, but the last day is Monday and the base day is Tuesday. They are different days of the week. So we cannot directly compare.\n\n  Therefore, we stick to the seasonal naive without adjustment.\n\n  Conclusion: We forecast the next 24 hours (April 1, 2014) as the same as March 25, 2014.\n\n  But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must provide a forecast. We are not using any complex model because we don't have enough data. \n\n  However, let me try to use a different approach: use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? That would be a weekly average for each hour. But we have only one week? Then it would be the same as the base day? No, because we average over 7 days. For example, for hour 0: \n      (26.03 (25th) + 24.65 (26th) + 26.03 (27th) + 27.02 (28th) + 26.86 (29th) + 26.74 (30th) + 27.37 (31st)) / 7 = 26.24\n\n  Then we would use 26.24 for hour 0 of April 1.\n\n  This method uses the average of the same hour over the past 7 days. This is a seasonal average method.\n\n  Which one is better? The seasonal naive (same day last week) or the average of the same hour over the last 7 days?\n\n  Given that we have only one week, the average over the last 7 days will smooth out the daily patterns. But note: the week includes both weekdays and weekends. The next day is a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday (25th) had a pattern that might be more similar than the average of the week.\n\n  However, the average of the same hour over the last 7 days might be more robust.\n\n  Let me compare the two:\n\n  Method 1: Seasonal naive (same day last week) -> uses the exact pattern of the last Tuesday.\n  Method 2: Average of the same hour over the last 7 days -> smooths the pattern and might be less sensitive to one-off events.\n\n  Without more data to validate, we choose Method 2: average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This is because the entire week's data is available and it might be more stable.\n\n  How to compute: for each hour (0 to 23) of the day, we take the average of that hour for the 7 days we have.\n\n  Example for hour 0 (midnight):\n      Days: 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st -> values: 26.03, 24.65, 26.03, 27.02, 26.86, 26.74, 27.37\n      Average = (26.03+24.65+26.03+27.02+26.86+26.74+27.37)/7 = 26.24\n\n  Similarly for hour 1:\n      25.77, 24.11, 25.73, 26.69, 26.59, 25.92, 27.24 -> average = ?\n\n  We'll compute each hour.\n\n  Let me do the computation:\n\n  We'll create a list for each hour (0-23) and then average the 7 values.\n\n  Hour 0: [26.03, 24.65, 26.03, 27.02, 26.86, 26.74, 27.37] -> 26.24\n  Let me calculate: \n      26.03+24.65=50.68, +26.03=76.71, +27.02=103.73, +26.86=130.59, +26.74=157.33, +27.37=184.7 -> 184.7/7 = 26.3857\n\n  Actually, I did a mistake: 26.03+24.65=50.68, then 50.68+26.03=76.71, 76.71+27.02=103.73, 103.73+26.86=130.59, 130.59+26.74=157.33, 157.33+27.37=184.7 -> 184.7/7 = 26.3857 -> round to 2 decimals: 26.39\n\n  But note: the original data has 3 decimals. We'll keep 2 decimals as in the input.\n\n  The input data is given with 2 or 3 decimals? \n      Most are 2, but some are 3 (e.g., 25.185). We'll output with 2 decimals for consistency? The problem output format is not specified, but the input has 2 or 3. We'll output 2 decimals.\n\n  Actually, the example: 2014/3/30 2:00 25.185 -> 3 decimals. But the problem says \"Observed Nord Pool electricity price (\u20ac/MWh, 1-hour resolution) time series\", and the decimals are as given. We should output with the same precision? But the majority are 2. We'll output 2 decimals.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"You must give the full sequence \u2014 do not skip or summarize any values.\" and the format should be the same as the input? The input has 2 or 3 decimals. But note: the input for the forecast is not given, so we can output 2 decimals.\n\n  We'll output 2 decimals.\n\n  Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n  We'll create a 2D array: 24 hours x 7 days.\n\n  But note: the data is from 2014-03-25 (day0) to 2014-03-31 (day6).\n\n  For hour0 (00:00): \n      day0: 26.03, day1:24.65, day2:26.03, day3:27.02, day4:26.86, day5:26.74, day6:27.37 ->
