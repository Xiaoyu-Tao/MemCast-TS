        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013-11-05 00:00 to 2013-11-11 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2013-11-12 00:00 to 2013-11-12 23:00.\n\n However, note that the data provided does not have any missing values in the given period. We can observe a clear daily pattern (diurnal) and weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekend). The prices are typically higher during the day and lower at night, and also higher on weekdays than on weekends.\n\n Since we are only given the historical prices and no exogenous variables (like load or wind forecasts for the future), we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: Seasonal Naive method. The data has a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). Therefore, we can use the prices from the same time of the previous day (i.e., 24 hours ago) as the forecast.\n\n However, note that the last day in the historical data is Monday (2013-11-11). The next 24 hours are for Tuesday (2013-11-12). We should consider the weekly pattern: Tuesdays might be similar to the previous Tuesday (2013-11-05) or the same day of the previous week? But note that we have only one week of data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last few days? But the pattern on weekends is different.\n\n Since we have only 7-day data, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 7 days ago) for each hour. But note: 7 days ago was a Tuesday (2013-11-05). However, the next day we are forecasting is also a Tuesday (2013-11-12). So we can use the values from 2013-11-05 (which is 7 days before 2013-11-12) for each hour.\n\n But wait: our historical data ends at 2013-11-11 23:00. The next hour is 2013-11-12 00:00. The same hour 7 days ago is 2013-11-05 00:00? Actually, 7 days * 24 hours = 168 hours. So the hour at 2013-11-12 00:00 corresponds to 2013-11-05 00:00.\n\n Therefore, we can use the entire day of 2013-11-05 as the forecast for 2013-11-12.\n\n However, let's check the data: \n  2013-11-05 was a Tuesday and 2013-11-12 is also a Tuesday. This might be reasonable.\n\n But note: the data from 2013-11-05 (Tuesday) to 2013-11-11 (Monday) is exactly 7 days. So the same day last week is 2013-11-05.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2013-11-12 00:00 is the same as 2013-11-05 00:00 (33.14), and so on.\n\n However, we must consider that the market conditions might have changed. But without more data, this is a simple and common baseline.\n\n Alternatively, we could use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we might not include weekend days? Or we could use only the same weekday? We have only one Tuesday in the data (2013-11-05). So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n Therefore, the simplest approach is to use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2013-11-05) for the entire day of 2013-11-12.\n\n But note: the data for 2013-11-05 is:\n\n  2013/11/5 0:00 33.14\n  2013/11/5 1:00 32.42\n  2013/11/5 2:00 32.24\n  2013/11/5 3:00 32.26\n  2013/11/5 4:00 32.99\n  2013/11/5 5:00 34.12\n  2013/11/5 6:00 36.32\n  2013/11/5 7:00 38.44\n  2013/11/5 8:00 38.76\n  2013/11/5 9:00 37.22\n  2013/11/5 10:00 36.56\n  2013/11/5 11:00 36.33\n  2013/11/5 12:00 36.65\n  2013/11/5 13:00 37.27\n  2013/11/5 14:00 37.57\n  2013/11/5 15:00 38.63\n  2013/11/5 16:00 39.94\n  2013/11/5 17:00 41.60\n  2013/11/5 18:00 40.12\n  2013/11/5 19:00 38.08\n  2013/11/5 20:00 36.93\n  2013/11/5 21:00 35.31\n  2013/11/5 22:00 34.62\n  2013/11/5 23:00 33.87\n\n So we will use these 24 values as the forecast for 2013-11-12.\n\n However, note that the last day in the data (2013-11-11, Monday) had higher prices than the previous Monday? Actually, we don't have the previous Monday. The data starts on Tuesday 2013-11-05. So we don't have a Monday from the same week? Actually, the data we have is from Tuesday to the next Monday (7 days). The Monday we have is 2013-11-11. The Tuesday we are forecasting is the next day after Monday.\n\n But the method of using the same day last week (i.e., 7 days ago) is still the best we can do with the given data.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for the next 24 hours (2013-11-12 00:00 to 2013-11-12 23:00) is the same as the prices on 2013-11-05 (from 00:00 to 23:00).\n\n However, let me double-check the dates: \n   The historical data starts at 2013-11/5 0:00 and ends at 2013/11/11 23:00 (which is 7 full days: 7*24=168 hours). The next 24 hours are 2013/11/12 0:00 to 2013/11/12 23:00.\n\n  The same hour 7 days ago for 2013/11/12 0:00 is 2013/11/5 0:00.\n\n So we output:\n\n  2013/11/12 0:00 33.14\n  2013/11/12 1:00 32.42\n  2013/11/12 2:00 32.24\n  2013/11/12 3:00 32.26\n  2013/11/12 4:00 32.99\n  2013/11/12 5:00 34.12\n  2013/11/12 6:00 36.32\n  2013/11/12 7:00 38.44\n  2013/11/12 8:00 38.76\n  2013/11/12 9:00 37.22\n  2013/11/12 10:00 36.56\n  2013/11/12 11:00 36.33\n  2013/11/12 12:00 36.65\n  2013/11/12 13:00 37.27\n  2013/11/12 14:00 37.57\n  2013/11/12 15:00 38.63\n  2013/11/12 16:00 39.94\n  2013/11/12 17:00 41.60\n  2013/11/12 18:00 40.12\n  2013/11/12 19:00 38.08\n  2013/11/12 20:00 36.93\n  2013/11/12 21:00 35.31\n  2013/11/12 22:00 34.62\n  2013/11/12 23:00 33.87\n\n But note: the problem says \"some data may contain missing values\", but in the provided data there are no missing values. So we don't need to handle any missing values in the historical data.\n\n Therefore, we output the above.\n\n However, let me note: in practice, we might use a more sophisticated model, but given the constraints (only historical prices and no exogenous variables) and the requirement for a simple method, the seasonal naive with seasonality of 1 week (168 hours) is a standard baseline.\n\n Let's write the answer in the required format.\n",
