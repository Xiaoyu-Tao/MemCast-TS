        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (7 days * 24 hours). The last timestamp is 2015/12/21 23:00.\n We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015/12/22 0:00 to 2015/12/22 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, there are 168 records (from 2015/12/15 0:00 to 2015/12/21 23:00). \n    The data seems complete (no gaps in the timestamps and no NaN values in the 'OT' column). So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. Since we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we know that electricity prices exhibit:\n    - Seasonality (daily, weekly patterns)\n    - Non-linear relationships with factors (like load, wind, etc.) but we are only given the price history.\n\n 3. We are only provided with the historical prices. Therefore, we must use a time series model that can capture:\n    - Autocorrelation (e.g., AR, MA components)\n    - Daily seasonality (24-hour pattern)\n    - Weekly seasonality? (but we only have one week of data for the immediate history, so we can capture daily)\n\n 4. Given the short history (only 7 days) and the requirement for 24-hour forecast, we can use:\n    - A model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) with daily seasonality (seasonal period = 24).\n    - However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern (low at night, peaks in the morning and evening).\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a simple method: \n    - Since the pattern is strong and the week includes a weekend (which typically has lower prices) and we are forecasting a Tuesday (2015/12/22, which is a weekday), \n      we might consider using the average of the same hour of the previous weekdays (but note: the data starts on a Tuesday and we have 7 days: \n          Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon -> then we are forecasting Tue again).\n\n    However, the weekdays are not exactly the same: \n        Day 1: Tue (2015-12-15)\n        Day 2: Wed (2015-12-16)\n        Day 3: Thu (2015-12-17)\n        Day 4: Fri (2015-12-18)\n        Day 5: Sat (2015-12-19) -> weekend\n        Day 6: Sun (2015-12-20) -> weekend\n        Day 7: Mon (2015-12-21) -> weekday\n\n    We are forecasting the next day: Tue (2015-12-22). \n\n    We can take the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2015-12-15) and the Monday (2015-12-21) and also the Wednesday (2015-12-16) and Thursday (2015-12-17) and Friday (2015-12-18) but note that Friday might have a different pattern because it's before the weekend.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use a weighted average giving more weight to the most recent days.\n\n 6. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have exogenous variables, we can use:\n    - Exponential Smoothing with seasonality (Holt-Winters) or \n    - A naive approach: use the same day of the previous week (i.e., last Tuesday) but adjusted by the recent trend.\n\n 7. However, note that the last day (Monday, 2015-12-21) had a significant drop in the evening (down to 4.96 at 23:00) which might be an outlier? \n    But we have to consider it.\n\n 8. Given the constraints, I propose to use a simple average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday) but excluding the weekend? \n    But note: \n        Tuesday (2015-12-15) -> included\n        Wednesday (2015-12-16) -> included\n        Thursday (2015-12-17) -> included\n        Friday (2015-12-18) -> included\n        Monday (2015-12-21) -> included\n\n    We have 5 weekdays. However, the pattern on Friday might be different (it was lower overall) and Monday was also lower.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) and adjust by the overall trend of the last 24 hours? \n\n 9. Given the complexity and without a model pre-trained, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays? \n\n    But note: the last three weekdays are: \n        (2015-12-21: Monday, 2015-12-18: Friday, 2015-12-17: Thursday)\n\n    However, we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we can also include the Tuesday of last week (2015-12-15).\n\n 10. Let me try a weighted average:\n     - Weight the most recent weekday (Monday, 2015-12-21) by 0.4\n     - Weight the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2015-12-15) by 0.3\n     - Weight the next most recent weekday (Friday, 2015-12-18) by 0.2\n     - Weight the next (Thursday, 2015-12-17) by 0.1\n\n     But note: we have 5 weekdays, but we are only taking 4? And why these weights?\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). \n     So for hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (Tuesday, 2015-12-22):\n\n        forecast_h = (h_Mon + h_Fri + h_Thu + h_last_Tue) / 4\n\n 12. But let's check the data: \n        On Monday (2015-12-21) at 0:00: 9.44, at 1:00: 6.78, ... at 23:00: 4.96\n        On Friday (2015-12-18) at 0:00: 17.38, ... at 23:00: 15.46 -> much higher than Monday\n        On Thursday (2015-12-17) at 0:00: 19.47, ... at 23:00: 18.69 -> higher\n        On last Tuesday (2015-12-15) at 0:00: 20.33, ... at 23:00: 20.27 -> higher\n\n     There is a clear downward trend. So we might want to give more weight to the most recent days.\n\n 13. We can use exponential smoothing: \n        forecast_h = alpha * h_Mon + beta * h_Fri + gamma * h_Thu + delta * h_last_Tue\n     with alpha + beta + gamma + delta = 1, and alpha being the largest (for Monday) and then decreasing.\n\n     Let: \n        alpha = 0.5 (for Monday, the most recent)\n        beta = 0.2 (for Friday, 3 days ago)\n        gamma = 0.2 (for Thursday, 4 days ago)\n        delta = 0.1 (for last Tuesday, 7 days ago)\n\n 14. However, note that Monday (2015-12-21) was a very low day, especially in the evening. Is that a new trend or an anomaly? \n     Without more context (like holidays or weather) we have to rely on the pattern.\n\n 15. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and adjust by the ratio of the last two days? \n\n 16. Given the time and the requirement for a quick answer, I will use the weighted average as in step 13.\n\n     Weights:\n        Monday (2015-12-21): weight = 0.5\n        Friday (2015-12-18): weight = 0.2\n        Thursday (2015-12-17): weight = 0.2\n        Tuesday (2015-12-15): weight = 0.1\n\n     For each hour (0 to 23) of the day:\n\n        forecast_value = (0.5 * value_at_hour_from_Monday + \n                          0.2 * value_at_hour_from_Friday + \n                          0.2 * value_at_hour_from_Thursday + \n                          0.1 * value_at_hour_from_Tuesday)\n\n 17. But note: the data for Monday (2015-12-21) at 23:00 was 4.96, which is very low. This might be an outlier? \n     However, we don't have information to confirm. We'll use it.\n\n 18. Let's compute the first hour (0:00) for 2015/12/22:\n\n        Monday (0:00): 9.44\n        Friday (0:00): 17.38\n        Thursday (0:00): 19.47\n        Tuesday (0:00): 20.33\n\n        forecast_0 = 0.5*9.44 + 0.2*17.38 + 0.2*19.47 + 0.1*20.33\n                   = 4.72 + 3.476 + 3.894 + 2.033\n                   = 14.123\n\n 19. Similarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 20. However, note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included. This is because we are forecasting a weekday and we are using weekdays.\n\n 21. We'll generate the forecast for 24 hours from 2015/12/22 0:00 to 2015/12/22 23:00.\n\n 22. We must output the forecast in the required format.\n\n 23. Let's do the calculation for all 24 hours.\n\n     We have the data for the weekdays:\n\n        Tuesday (2015-12-15): \n           0:00:20.33, 1:00:20.04, 2:00:19.87, 3:00:20.03, 4:00:20.43, 5:00:21.07, 23:00:20.27\n\n        Thursday (2015-12-17): \n           0:00:19.47, 1:00:19.01, 2:00:18.85, 3:00:18.81, ... 23:00:18.69\n\n        Friday (2015-12-18): \n           0:00:17.38, 1:00:16.82, 2:00:16.39, ... 23:00:15.46\n\n        Monday (2015-12-21): \n           0:00:9.44, 1:00:6.78, 2:00:6.00, ... 23:00:4.96\n\n 24. We'll compute each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: 0.5*9.44 + 0.2*17.38 + 0.2*19.47 + 0.1*20.33 = 4.72 + 3.476 + 3.894 + 2.033 = 14.123 -> round to 2 decimals: 14.12\n     Hour 1: 0.5*6.78 + 0.2*16.82 + 0.2*19.01 + 0.1*20.04 = 3.39 + 3.364 + 3.802 + 2.004 = 12.56\n     Hour 2: 0.5*6.00 + 0.2*16.39 + 0.2*18.85 + 0.1*19.87 = 3.0 + 3.278 + 3.77 + 1.987 = 12.035 -> 12.04\n     Hour 3: 0.5*6.64 + 0.2*16.43 + 0.2*18.81 + 0.1*20.03 = 3.32 + 3.286 + 3.762 + 2.003 = 12.371 -> 12.37\n     Hour 4: 0.5*10.01 + 0.2*17.01 + 0.2*19.53 + 0.1*20.43 = 5.005 + 3.402 + 3.906 + 2.043 = 14.356 -> 14.36\n     Hour 5: 0.5*13.44 + 0.2*17.93 + 0.2*20.55 + 0.1*21.07 = 6.72 + 3.586 + 4.11 + 2.107 = 16.523 -> 16.52\n     Hour 6: 0.5*14.54 + 0.2*18.91 + 0.2*24.85 + 0.1*24.25 = 7.27 + 3.782 + 4.97 + 2.425 = 18.447 -> 18.45\n     Hour 7: 0.5*16.61 + 0.2*20.22 + 0.2*35.96 + 0.1*31.25 = 8.305 + 4.044 + 7.192 + 3.125 = 22.666 -> 22.67\n     Hour 8: 0.5*16.61 + 0.2*20.66 + 0.2*39.24 + 0.1*38.72 = 8.305 + 4.132 + 7.848 + 3.872 = 24.157 -> 24.16\n     Hour 9: 0.5*16.54 + 0.2*20.56 + 0.2*38.26 + 0.1*44.36 = 8.27 + 4.112 + 7.652 + 4.436 = 24.47 -> 24.47\n     Hour 10: 0.5*16.28 + 0.2*20.11 + 0.2*33.74 + 0.1*33.96 = 8.14 + 4.022 + 6.748 + 3.396 = 22.306 -> 22.31\n     Hour 11: 0.5*16.15 + 0.2*20.08 + 0.2*34.09 + 0.1*35.03 = 8.075 + 4.016 + 6.818 + 3.503 = 22.412 -> 22.41\n     Hour 12: 0.5*15.97 + 0.2*19.77 + 0.2*30.34 + 0.1*30.70 = 7.985 + 3.954 + 6.068 + 3.07 = 21.077 -> 21.08\n     Hour 13: 0.5*15.90 + 0.2*19.41 + 0.2*29.92 + 0.1*29.32 = 7.95 + 3.882 + 5.984 + 2.932 = 20.748 -> 20.75\n     Hour 14: 0.5*16.00 + 0.2*19.14 + 0.2*29.95 + 0.1*30.73 = 8.0 + 3.828 + 5.99 + 3.073 = 20.891 -> 20.89\n     Hour 15: 0.5*16.33 + 0.2*19.27 + 0.2*30.12 + 0.1*28.20 = 8.165 + 3.854 + 6.024 + 2.82 = 20.863 -> 20.86\n     Hour 16: 0.5*16.47 + 0.2*19.56 + 0.2*31.83 + 0.1*28.27 = 8.235 + 3.912 + 6.366 + 2.827 = 21.34 -> 21.34\n     Hour 17: 0.5*16.42 + 0.2*19.66 + 0.2*31.96 + 0.1*43.00 = 8.21 + 3.932 + 6.392 + 4.3 = 22.834 -> 22.83\n     Hour 18: 0.5*16.35 + 0.2*19.15 + 0.2*29.94 + 0.1*33.68 = 8.175 + 3.83 + 5.988 + 3.368 = 21.361 -> 21.36\n     Hour 19: 0.5*15.41 + 0.2*18.43 + 0.2*24.61 + 0.1*28.09 = 7.705 + 3.686 + 4.922 + 2.809 = 19.122 -> 19.12\n     Hour 20: 0.5*14.22 + 0.2*17.66 + 0.2*20.92 + 0.1*22.91 = 7.11 + 3.532 + 4.184 + 2.291 = 17.117 -> 17.12\n     Hour 21: 0.5*13.86 + 0.2*17.61 + 0.2*20.31 + 0.1*22.03 = 6.93 + 3.522 + 4.062 + 2.203 = 16.717 -> 16.72\n     Hour 22: 0.5*12.12 + 0.2*16.65 + 0.2*19.54 + 0.1*20.95 = 6.06 + 3.33 + 3.908 + 2.095 = 15.393 -> 15.39\n     Hour 23: 0.5*4.96 + 0.2*15.46 + 0.2*18.69 + 0.1*20.27 = 2.48 + 3.092 + 3.738 + 2.027 = 11.337 -> 11.34\n\n 25.
