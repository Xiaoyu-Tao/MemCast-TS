        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/3/18 0:00 to 2014/3/24 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/3/25 0:00 to 2014/3/25 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the target variable (OT: observed price) and the date. The problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but they are not provided. Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical prices for forecasting.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the historical prices, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data, we expect daily and weekly seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data provided is for 7 days (168 hours). We can observe:\n   - Daily pattern: Prices tend to be lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Also, note that the pattern might change on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) compared to weekdays.\n\n We are to forecast the next day, which is Tuesday (2014/3/25). The last day in the data is Monday (2014/3/24). \n\n Since we don't have exogenous variables, we can use a model that captures seasonality. One simple approach is to use the average of the same hour of the previous days, but we must account for the day of the week.\n\n However, we only have one week of data. We have:\n   - 2014/3/18 (Tuesday) to 2014/3/24 (Monday) -> 7 days.\n\n We can consider:\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But note: the day of the week for the forecast day (2014/3/25) is Tuesday. So we can take the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2014/3/18).\n\n   Option 2: Since we have only one week, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014/3/18) as a base and adjust by the recent trend? But the problem: the next day is Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n   Option 3: Use a moving average or exponential smoothing.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we can try:\n\n   - Using the average of the same hour over the available week (7 days) for the next day. But note: the pattern on weekends is different. Since 2014/3/25 is a Tuesday, we can take the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2014/3/18) and the same hour on the Monday (2014/3/24) and Wednesday (2014/3/19) to get a more relevant average? But we don't have a Wednesday of the next week.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a seasonal naive method: use the same hour of the previous week (i.e., 2014/3/18 for each hour). But that might not capture the recent trend.\n\n   Considering the recent trend: we can compute the average of the last 7 days for each hour and then adjust by the difference between the last day (Monday) and the same day a week before (Monday a week ago? but we don't have two Mondays). Actually, we have:\n        Monday: 2014/3/24\n        Previous Monday: 2014/3/17? -> not in the data.\n\n   We have only one week of data. Therefore, we can use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h (0-23) on 2014/3/25 = (Value of hour h on 2014/3/18) * (Value of hour h on 2014/3/24) / (Value of hour h on 2014/3/17) \n\n   but we don't have 2014/3/17.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But the last 7 days include Saturday and Sunday which are different.\n\n   Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday (2014/3/18) and the recent days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) which are not Tuesdays, we can do:\n\n        Forecast for hour h on Tuesday = (Value of hour h on the previous Tuesday) * (average of the last 3 days for that hour) / (average of the same 3 days relative to the previous week? but we don't have the week before)\n\n   Given the constraints, a better approach might be to use the last available Tuesday (2014/3/18) and adjust it by the overall trend of the last week.\n\n   We can compute the average price for the entire last week and the average price for the week before? but we don't have the week before.\n\n   Therefore, we can use a weighted average of the same hour on the same day of the week (only one instance) and the average of the same hour over the entire week? \n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But note: \n        The last 3 days: \n          2014/3/24: Monday (weekday)\n          2014/3/23: Sunday (weekend)\n          2014/3/22: Saturday (weekend)\n\n   We are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday). So we can use the same hour on the previous Tuesday and the same hour on Monday (2014/3/24) and then adjust by the ratio of Monday to the previous Monday? but we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n   Given the complexity and the lack of data, a simple method is to use the same hour of the previous week (i.e., 2014/3/18) and then adjust by the overall change from the previous week to the current week? but we don't have the entire previous week.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a moving average model. Let's consider:\n\n        We can use a 24-hour moving average? But that would smooth out the daily pattern.\n\n   Given the data, I propose:\n\n        We use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays that are available: \n            Tuesday (2014/3/18), Wednesday (2014/3/19), Thursday (2014/3/20), Friday (2014/3/21), and Monday (2014/3/24). \n        But note: we are missing Thursday, Friday? Actually, we have:\n            2014/3/18: Tuesday\n            2014/3/19: Wednesday\n            2014/3/20: Thursday\n            2014/3/21: Friday\n            2014/3/22: Saturday\n            2014/3/23: Sunday\n            2014/3/24: Monday\n\n        So for the same hour (say 0:00) on a Tuesday, we can take the 0:00 values from the previous Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday? But that mixes weekdays and weekends.\n\n        Alternatively, we can take only the same day of the week (Tuesday) and the same day of the next day (Monday) and the same day of the previous day (Wednesday) to form a small set? \n\n        Since we have only one Tuesday, we can use the average of the same hour on the last Monday (2014/3/24) and the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2014/3/18) and then adjust by the ratio of Monday to the previous Monday? but we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n   Considering the above, a simpler approach is to use the same hour from the previous week (2014/3/18) and then adjust by the average change from the previous week to the current week? but we don't have the entire previous week.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days and then adjust by the linear trend? \n\n   However, note that the problem does not require a sophisticated model. We are to provide a forecast.\n\n   After reviewing the data, we can see that the prices on 2014/3/24 (Monday) are generally higher than on 2014/3/18 (Tuesday). We can compute the ratio of the same hour on Monday (2014/3/24) to the same hour on the previous Monday? but we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n   Instead, we can compute the average price for the entire period and then the average for the previous Tuesday to the current Monday? and then use:\n\n        Forecast for hour h = (Value of hour h on 2014/3/18) * (Average price of the entire last week) / (Average price of the week starting from 2014/3/18 to 2014/3/24 without the weekend? or including?)\n\n   But note: the entire week average is the same as the average of the 7 days.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing with seasonality. But without a library, we have to do it manually.\n\n   Given the constraints, I choose a simple method:\n\n        We will use the same hour from the previous week (2014/3/18) and adjust it by the trend observed in the last 24 hours.\n\n        Specifically, we can compute the average price of the last 24 hours (2014/3/24 0:00 to 23:00) and the average price of the 24 hours of the previous Tuesday (2014/3/18). Then the adjustment factor is:\n\n            factor = (average of 2014/3/24) / (average of 2014/3/18)\n\n        Then forecast for hour h on 2014/3/25 = (value of hour h on 2014/3/18) * factor.\n\n   But note: the day of the week effect might be different.\n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust by the ratio of the same day of the week? We don't have two Mondays to adjust the Tuesday.\n\n   Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) and then adjust for the Tuesday by the ratio of the previous Tuesday to the average of the previous Thursday, Friday, and Monday? \n\n   Steps:\n\n        Step 1: For each hour h (0-23), collect the values for:\n            - The previous Tuesday (2014/3/18, h)\n            - The Thursday (2014/3/20, h)\n            - The Friday (2014/3/21, h)\n            - The Monday (2014/3/24, h)\n\n        Step 2: Compute the average of these four weekdays for hour h: \n            avg_h = (Tue_old_h + Thu_h + Fri_h + Mon_h) / 4\n\n        But note: we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we want to give more weight to the previous Tuesday? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use the previous Tuesday and then adjust by the average change from the previous Tuesday to the current Monday? \n\n        Specifically:\n\n            change_factor = (Mon_h / Tue_old_h)   [for each hour? or overall?]\n\n        We can do an overall factor: \n\n            total_Mon = average of all hours on 2014/3/24\n            total_Tue_old = average of all hours on 2014/3/18\n            overall_factor = total_Mon / total_Tue_old\n\n        Then forecast for hour h = Tue_old_h * overall_factor\n\n   Let's compute the overall factor:\n\n        Average for 2014/3/18 (Tuesday): \n            Sum = 25.04+24.60+24.38+24.31+25.00+26.31+27.03+29.27+29.77+29.12+28.29+27.73+27.16+27.25+27.05+26.97+26.98+27.85+28.31+28.35+27.70+27.15+24.97+23.82\n            = 625.16\n            Average = 625.16 / 24 = 26.04833\n\n        Average for 2014/3/24 (Monday):\n            Sum = 25.15+25.03+25.02+24.97+25.22+26.79+28.13+30.40+31.48+30.57+29.91+28.89+28.26+27.84+27.34+27.22+27.11+27.79+29.04+29.19+28.13+27.17+26.03+25.43\n            = 664.71\n            Average = 664.71 / 24 = 27.69625\n\n        overall_factor = 27.69625 / 26.04833 \u2248 1.0633\n\n        Then forecast for hour h on 2014/3/25 = value of 2014/3/18 at hour h * 1.0633\n\n   But note: this method applies the same multiplicative factor to every hour. It might be too simplistic.\n\n   We can also compute an hour-specific factor? But we don't have multiple Mondays to compare.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the same hour on Monday and the same hour on the previous Tuesday to compute an hour-specific factor? \n\n        factor_h = (Mon_h) / (Tue_old_h)\n\n        Then forecast_h = Tue_old_h * factor_h = Mon_h   -> which is just using Monday's value? That doesn't account for the day of the week.\n\n   Given that we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday and one Monday, we can use:\n\n        forecast_h = (Tue_old_h + Mon_h) / 2   [simple average]\n\n   But that would ignore the weekly pattern? It would mix Monday and Tuesday.\n\n   Considering the above, I will use the overall factor method as it at least adjusts for the overall level change.\n\n   Let me compute the forecast for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: 25.04 * 1.0633 \u2248 26.63\n        Hour 1: 24.60 * 1.0633 \u2248 26.16\n        ... and so on.\n\n   But note: the data shows that the Monday (2014/3/24) was generally higher than the previous Tuesday (2014/3/18) by about 6.33%.\n\n   However, we can also consider the possibility of a downward trend? The last day (Monday) was higher, but the days before were lower? \n\n   We can also compute the factor using the entire week? \n\n        Average of the entire week (7 days): \n            We have 168 data points. We can compute the average of the entire week: \n                total_sum = sum of all 168 values\n                total_avg = total_sum / 168\n\n        Then we can compute the average of the previous week? but we don't have it.\n\n   Given the data, I think the overall factor between the last Monday and the previous Tuesday is a reasonable approach.\n\n   But note: the last Monday is the most recent day and might be more relevant. However, we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we want to use the Tuesday pattern.\n\n   Therefore, I will use:\n\n        forecast_h = value of 2014/3/18 at hour h * (average of 2014/3/24) / (average of 2014/3/18)\n\n   Let me calculate the factor again: 27.69625 / 26.04833 = 1.0633 (rounded to 4 decimals)\n\n   Now, we compute each hour:\n\n        We take the value from 2014/3/18 for the corresponding hour and multiply by 1.0633.\n\n   However, note that the data for 2014/3/18:\n\n        0:00: 25.04 -> 25.04 * 1.0633 = 26.63\n        1:00: 24.60 -> 24.60 * 1.0633 = 26.16\n        2:00: 24.38 -> 24.38 * 1.0633 = 25.93\n        3:00: 24.31 -> 24.31 * 1.0633 = 25.85\n        4:00: 25.00 -> 25.00 * 1.0633 = 26.58\n        5:00: 26.31 -> 26.31 * 1.0633 = 27.98\n        6:00: 27.03 -> 27.03 * 1.0633 = 28.75\n        7:00: 29.27 -> 29.27 * 1.0633 = 31.13\n        8:00: 29.77 -> 29.77 * 1.0633 = 31.66\n        9:00: 29.12 -> 29.12 * 1.0633 = 30.97\n        10:00: 28.29 -> 28.29 * 1.0633 = 30.08\n        11:00: 27.73 -> 27.73 * 1.0633 = 29.49\n        12:00: 27.16 -> 27.16 * 1.0633 = 28.88\n        13:00: 27.25 -> 27.25 * 1.0633 = 28.98\n        14:00: 27.05 -> 27.05 * 1.0633 = 28.77\n        15:00: 26.97 -> 26.97 * 1.0633 = 28.68\n        16:00: 26.98 -> 26.98 * 1.0633 = 28.69\n        17:00: 27.85 -> 27.85 * 1.0633 = 29.62\n        18:00: 28.31 -> 28.31 * 1.0633 = 30.10\n        19:00: 28.35 -> 28.35 * 1.0633 = 30.15\n        20:00: 27.70 -> 27.70 * 1.0633 = 29.46\n        21:00: 27.15 -> 27.15 * 1.0633 = 28.87\n        22:00: 24.97 -> 24.97 * 1.0633 = 26.55\n        23:00: 23.82 -> 23.82 * 1.0633 = 25.33\n\n   But note: the last Monday (2014/3/24) had a very high peak at 8:00 (31.48) and 9:00 (30.57), which is higher than the previous Tuesday. Our forecast for 8:00 is 31.66 and 9:00 is 30.97, which is in line.\n\n   However, we must consider that the factor is constant and might not capture the intraday variation. But given the simplicity and the data available, we use this.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the entire week (7 days) for each hour? \n\n        For hour 0: average of the 7 days at 0:00: \n            [25.04, 24.01, 23.07, 19.17, 24.14, 23.35, 25.15] \n            = (25.04+24.01+23.07+19.17+24.14+23.35+25.15) / 7 = 164.93 / 7 = 23.56\n\n        Then we adjust by the overall level? We don't have a clear way.\n\n   Given the above, I think the first method (using the previous Tuesday adjusted by the overall factor) is acceptable.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2014/3/21 (Friday) and 2014/3/22 (Saturday) and 2014/3/23 (Sunday) are lower. The Monday (2014/3/24) was a spike. \n\n   We can also consider using the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the previous Tuesday? \n\n        For each hour h: \n            forecast_h = (Mon_h + Fri_h + Tue_old_h) / 3\n\n        But that would be:\n\n            Hour 0: (25.15 + 2014/3/21 0:00=19.17 + 25.04) / 3 = (25.15+19.17+25.04)/3 = 69.36/3 = 23.12\n\n        This is very different from the previous method.\n\n   Considering the recent spike on Monday, we might want to give more weight to Monday? \n\n   Another idea: use the previous Tuesday and the most recent Monday and weight Monday more? \n\n        forecast_h = (0.7 * Mon_h + 0.3 * Tue_old_h)\n\n        Then:\n            Hour 0: 0.7*25.15 + 0.3*25.04 = 17.605 + 7.512 = 25.117\n\n        But this ignores the Tuesday pattern.\n\n   After careful thought, I think the multiplicative factor method that adjusts the entire previous Tuesday by the overall level change observed in the last Monday relative to the previous Tuesday is a reasonable baseline.\n\n   Therefore, we will output the forecast as:\n\n        2014/3/25 0:00: 26.63\n        2014/3/25 1:00: 26.16\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n   Let me recalculate with rounding:\n\n        factor = 27.69625 / 26.04833 = 1.0633 (we'll use this factor for every hour)\n\n        We'll compute each value and round to two decimals.\n\n   However, note that the factor is approximate. We can use the exact factor: 27.69625 / 26.04833 = 1.71/24 divided by 625.16/24 = 664.71/625.16 = 1.0633.\n\n   We'll use 1.0633.\n\n   But to be precise, we can use:\n\n        factor = 664.71 / 625.16 = 1.0633 (exactly: 664.71 \u00f7 625.16 \u2248 1.0633)\n\n   We'll use 1.0633.\n\n   Now, we compute:\n\n        Hour 0: 25.04 * 1.0633 = 25.63 (wait, let me calculate: 25.04 * 1.0633 = 25.04 * 1.0633)\n        Let me do the multiplication:\n\n            25.04 * 1.0633 = 25.04 * (1 + 0.0633) = 25.04 + 25.04*0.0633\n            25.04 * 0.0633 = 1.585032\n            so 25.04 + 1.585032 = 26.625032 -> 26.63\n\n        Similarly, we do for every hour.\n\n   We'll write the forecast for the next 24 hours in the required format.\n\n   Note: The date for the next 24 hours is from 2014/3/25 0:00 to 2014/3/25 23:00.\n\n   Let's create the list:\n\n        0:00: 26.63\n        1:00: 24.60 * 1.0633 = 24.60 * 1.0633 = 24.60 + 0.0633*24.60 = 24.60 + 1.55718 = 26.15718 -> 26.16\n        2:00: 24.38 * 1.0633 = 24.38 + 0.0633*24.38 = 24.38 + 1.543254 = 25.923254 -> 25.92\n        3:00: 24.31 * 1.0633 = 24.31 + 0.0633*24.31 = 24.31 + 1.538823 = 25.848823 -> 25.85\n        4:00: 25.00 * 1.0633 = 25.00 + 0.0633*25.00 = 25.00 + 1.5825 = 26.5825 -> 26.58\n        5:00: 26.31 * 1.0633 = 26.31 + 0.0633*26.31 = 26.31 + 1.665423 = 27.975423 -> 27.98\n        6:00: 27.03 * 1.0633 = 27.03 + 0.0633*27.03 = 27.03 + 1.711599 = 28.741599 -> 28.74\n        7:00: 29.27 * 1.0633 = 29.27 + 0.0633*29.27 = 29.27 + 1.853791 = 31.123791 -> 31.12\n        8:00: 29.77 * 1.0633 = 29.77 + 0.0633*29.77 = 29.77 + 1.884841 = 31.654841 -> 31.65\n        9:00: 29.12 * 1.0633 = 29.12 + 0.0633*29.12 = 29.12 + 1.843296 = 30.963296 -> 30.96\n        10:00: 28.29 * 1.0633 = 28.29 + 0.0633*28.29 = 28.29 + 1.790757 = 30.080757 -> 30.08\n        11:00: 27.73 * 1.0633 = 27.73 + 0.0633*27.73 = 27.73 + 1.755309 = 29.485309 -> 29.49\n        12:00: 27.16 * 1.0633 = 27.16 + 0.0633*27.16 = 27.16 + 1.719228 = 28.879228 -> 28.88\n        13:00: 27.25 * 1.0633 = 27.25 + 0.0633*27.25 = 27.25 + 1.724925 = 28.974925 -> 28.97\n        14:00: 27.05 * 1.0633 = 27.05 + 0.0633*27.05 = 27.05 + 1.712265 = 28.762265 -> 28.76\n        15:00: 26.97 * 1.0633 = 26.97 + 0.0633*26.97 = 26.97 + 1.707201 = 28.677201 -> 28.68\n        16:00: 26.98 * 1.0633 = 26.98 + 0.0633*26.98 = 26.98 + 1.707834 = 28.687834 -> 28.69\n        17:00: 27.85 * 1.0633 = 27.85 + 0.0633*27.85 = 27.85 + 1.763305 = 29.613305 -> 29.61\n        18:00: 28.31 * 1.0633 = 28.31 + 0.0633*28.31 = 28.31 + 1.792223 = 30.102223 -> 30.10\n        19:00: 28.35 * 1.0633 = 28.35 + 0.0633*28.35 = 28.35 + 1.794555 = 30.144555 -> 30.14\n        20:00: 27.70 * 1.0633 = 27.70 + 0.0633*27.70 = 27.70 + 1.75341 = 29.45341 -> 29.45\n        21:00: 27.15 * 1.0633 = 27.15 + 0.0633*27.15 = 27.15 + 1.718595 = 28.868595 -> 28.87\n        22:00: 24.97 * 1.0633 = 24.97 + 0.0633*24.97 = 24.97 + 1.580601 = 26.550601 -> 26.55\n        23:00: 23.82 * 1.0633 = 23.82 + 0.0633*23.82 = 23.82 + 1.507806 = 25.327806 -> 25.33\n\n   We'll output these values.\n\n   However, note that the data on 2014/3/24 (Monday) was higher than the previous Tuesday, and we are applying a constant factor.

But we did the multiplication by hand with rounding at the end.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the exact factor: 664.71/625.16 = 1.0633 (we'll use 1.0633 as a constant).\n\n   We'll output the forecast.\n",
