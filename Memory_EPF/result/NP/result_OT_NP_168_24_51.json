        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013-12-24 00:00 to 2013-12-30 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2013-12-31 00:00 to 2013-12-31 23:00.\n\n However, note that the data provided ends at 2013/12/30 23:00. The next 24 hours would be the entire day of 2013-12-31.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have to handle missing values, we note that the provided data does not have any missing values in the given period. Therefore, we can proceed to forecasting.\n\n Approach:\n We are not provided with any exogenous variables (like grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts) in the given data, only the historical prices. So we have to rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the target variable (OT: observed price).\n\n Given the hourly data and the need for 24-hour ahead forecast, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality. A common approach for such problems is to use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model or exponential smoothing state space model with seasonality (like Holt-Winters). However, without the ability to fit a model in real-time, we are to provide a forecast.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method such as:\n   - Using the average of the same hour in the past 7 days (since we have exactly 7 days of data) to account for daily seasonality.\n\n But note: the data we have is from 2013-12-24 to 2013-12-30 (7 days). We are to forecast 2013-12-31, which is a Tuesday (since 2013-12-24 was a Tuesday, so 7 days later is Tuesday again? Actually, 2013-12-24 is Tuesday, then 2013-12-31 is also Tuesday). So we can use the average of the same hour for the past week.\n\n However, we must consider that the last day (2013-12-30) is a Monday and the day we are forecasting (2013-12-31) is a Tuesday. So we can take the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2013-12-24) and the same hour from the same day of the week in the past? But we only have one Tuesday in the data (2013-12-24). Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the available 7 days? But that would include different days of the week.\n\n Another idea: use the last week's same day (Tuesday) and then adjust by the overall trend? But we don't have a clear trend in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour for the last few days? But without a model, we have to be simple.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method and we are to act as an expert, I choose a simple and robust method: \n   - For each hour (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2013-12-31), we take the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (i.e., 2013-12-24 to 2013-12-30).\n\n However, note that the data shows a pattern: the prices are generally higher during the day and lower at night. Also, the week of Christmas might have different patterns? But we are forecasting for New Year's Eve (2013-12-31) which is a holiday. So the pattern might be similar to Christmas Eve? But Christmas Eve was 2013-12-24, which is in our data.\n\n But we have only one Christmas Eve and one New Year's Eve? Actually, 2013-12-24 and 2013-12-31 are both Tuesdays and both are holidays? So we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday? But that might be too little data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the last 3 days? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n Considering the above, I will use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. This is simple and can capture the daily seasonality.\n\n Steps:\n   For hour h in [0,23]:\n        forecast_h = (price of h on 2013-12-24 + price of h on 2013-12-25 + ... + price of h on 2013-12-30) / 7\n\n However, note that 2013-12-25 is Christmas Day and 2013-12-31 is New Year's Eve, so they are both holidays. But we don't have a long history of holidays. Since we have only 7 days, we'll use the entire week.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (28.04 + 25.87 + 28.70 + 29.50 + 25.86 + 28.68 + 27.90) / 7\n Hour 1: (25.59 + 25.07 + 25.80 + 28.31 + 23.79 + 26.31 + 25.59) / 7\n ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for 2013-12-30 1:00 is 25.59? Actually, the data for 2013-12-30 1:00 is 25.59 (as per the last entries).\n\n However, we must be cautious: the data for each day is from 0:00 to 23:00. We have 7 days, so 7 values for each hour.\n\n Let me compute the first few:\n\n Hour 0 (00:00):\n   days: 24,25,26,27,28,29,30\n   values: 28.04, 25.87, 28.70, 29.50, 25.86, 28.68, 27.90\n   sum = 28.04+25.87+28.70+29.50+25.86+28.68+27.90 = 174.55\n   avg = 174.55 / 7 = 24.9357 \u2248 24.94\n\n Hour 1 (01:00):\n   values: 25.59, 25.07, 25.80, 28.31, 23.79, 26.31, 25.59\n   sum = 25.59+25.07+25.80+28.31+23.79+26.31+25.59 = 160.46\n   avg = 160.46 / 7 = 22.9228 \u2248 22.92\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the problem says to handle missing values carefully, but we don't have any in the provided data. So we can proceed.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that the last day (2013-12-30) might be more relevant? But the method of averaging 7 days is acceptable.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2013-12-31 00:00 to 2013-12-31 23:00) using the method above.\n\n We'll list the forecasted prices for each hour.\n\n But note: the dates in the future are:\n   2013/12/31 0:00\n   2013/12/31 1:00\n   ...\n   2013/12/31 23:00\n\n We'll compute:\n\n   h0: 00:00 -> (28.04 + 25.87 + 28.70 + 29.50 + 25.86 + 28.68 + 27.90) / 7 = 24.94 (rounded to two decimals as in the input)\n   h1: 01:00 -> (25.59+25.07+25.80+28.31+23.79+26.31+25.59)/7 = 22.92\n   h2: 02:00 -> (24.81+24.64+25.12+27.44+23.01+24.65+24.32)/7 = 24.855 -> 24.86\n   h3: 03:00 -> (23.33+24.09+24.55+27.35+21.63+23.39+24.66)/7 = 24.143 -> 24.14\n   h4: 04:00 -> (24.16+24.90+24.94+27.93+23.25+23.61+25.65)/7 = 24.92 -> 24.92\n   h5: 05:00 -> (25.29+25.10+25.55+28.75+23.91+24.16+27.85)/7 = 25.80 -> 25.80\n   h6: 06:00 -> (27.27+26.34+27.07+29.48+25.97+25.76+28.88)/7 = 27.25 -> 27.25\n   h7: 07:00 -> (28.15+26.90+28.04+30.01+27.08+26.38+30.41)/7 = 28.14 -> 28.14\n   h8: 08:00 -> (28.42+26.84+29.33+30.87+27.57+27.10+30.97)/7 = 28.73 -> 28.73\n   h9: 09:00 -> (29.21+27.36+30.45+30.58+28.79+28.89+31.29)/7 = 29.51 -> 29.51\n   h10:10:00 -> (29.40+29.21+30.84+30.26+29.31+29.74+31.32)/7 = 30.01 -> 30.01\n   h11:11:00 -> (29.23+29.96+31.09+30.36+29.17+30.06+31.08)/7 = 30.14 -> 30.14\n   h12:12:00 -> (28.94+30.00+31.18+30.19+29.35+30.04+30.93)/7 = 30.09 -> 30.09\n   h13:13:00 -> (28.59+29.52+31.10+30.09+29.32+29.94+30.92)/7 = 29.93 -> 29.93\n   h14:14:00 -> (28.65+29.49+31.21+30.10+29.59+29.98+31.13)/7 = 30.02 -> 30.02\n   h15:15:00 -> (29.07+29.93+31.42+30.17+29.84+30.12+31.41)/7 = 30.28 -> 30.28\n   h16:16:00 -> (29.23+30.68+31.96+30.90+30.91+31.06+31.67)/7 = 30.92 -> 30.92\n   h17:17:00 -> (28.61+31.20+32.01+31.48+31.39+31.55+31.59)/7 = 31.12 -> 31.12\n   h18:18:00 -> (27.40+30.94+31.75+31.07+31.08+31.31+31.41)/7 = 30.71 -> 30.71\n   h19:19:00 -> (26.94+30.70+31.49+30.52+30.52+31.02+30.91)/7 = 30.30 -> 30.30\n   Wait, for h19: the days are:\n        24:26.94, 25:30.70, 26:31.49, 27:30.52, 28:30.52? -> but 28th: 30.52? Actually, 2013-12-28 19:00 is 30.52? \n        Let me check: \n          2013/12/28 19:00: 30.52? The data says: \"2013/12/28 19:00 30.52\" -> yes.\n        29:31.02, 30:30.91\n        So: 26.94, 30.70, 31.49, 30.52, 30.52, 31.02, 30.91 -> sum = 211.1, avg=30.157 -> 30.16? \n        But I see I wrote 30.30 above? That was a mistake.\n\n   Let me recalculate h19: \n        26.94 + 30.70 = 57.64\n        +31.49 = 89.13\n        +30.52 = 119.65\n        +30.52 = 150.17\n        +31.02 = 181.19\n        +30.91 = 212.10\n        avg = 212.10 / 7 = 30.30 -> actually 30.30? \n        But 212.10 / 7 = 30.30 exactly? 7*30.3=212.1 -> yes.\n\n   So h19: 30.30\n\n   h20:20:00 -> (26.16+30.39+31.32+29.35+30.05+30.38+30.14)/7 \n        = 26.16+30.39=56.55; +31.32=87.87; +29.35=117.22; +30.05=147.27; +30.38=177.65; +30.14=207.79\n        avg = 207.79/7 = 29.684 -> 29.68\n\n   h21:21:00 -> (26.86+30.25+31.13+28.87+29.98+30.29+29.52)/7\n        = 26.86+30.25=57.11; +31.13=88.24; +28.87=117.11; +29.98=147.09; +30.29=177.38; +29.52=206.90\n        avg = 206.90/7 = 29.557 -> 29.56\n\n   h22:22:00 -> (27.00+29.89+30.78+28.11+29.46+30.02+29.20)/7\n        = 27.00+29.89=56.89; +30.78=87.67; +28.11=115.78; +29.46=145.24; +30.02=175.26; +29.20=204.46\n        avg = 204.46/7 = 29.208 -> 29.21\n\n   h23:23:00 -> (26.00+29.29+30.30+27.02+28.78+29.28+28.15)/7\n        = 26.00+29.29=55.29; +30.30=85.59; +27.02=112.61; +28.78=141.39; +29.28=170.67; +28.15=198.82\n        avg = 198.82/7 = 28.40 -> 28.40\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2013-12-31:\n\n   2013/12/31 0:00 24.94\n   2013/12/31 1:00 22.92\n   2013/12/31 2:00 24.86\n   2013/12/31 3:00 24.14\n   2013/12/31 4:00 24.92\n   2013/12/31 5:00 25.80\n   2013/12/31 6:00 27.25\n   2013/12/31 7:00 28.14\n   2013/12/31 8:00 28.73\n   2013/12/31 9:00 29.51\n   2013/12/31 10:00 30.01\n   2013/12/31 11:00 30.14\n   2013/12/31 12:00 30.09\n   2013/12/31 13:00 29.93\n   2013/12/31 14:00 30.02\n   2013/12/31 15:00 30.28\n   2013/12/31 16:00 30.92\n   2013/12/31 17:00 31.12\n   2013/12/31 18:00 30.71\n   2013/12/31 19:00 30.30\n   2013/12/31 20:00 29.68\n   2013/12/31 21:00 29.56\n   2013/12/31 22:00 29.21\n   2013/12/31 23:00 28.40\n\n We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple average and may not be the most accurate, but without more sophisticated modeling tools and without the grid load and wind power forecasts, it is a reasonable baseline.\n\n Let me write the answer in the required format.\n",
