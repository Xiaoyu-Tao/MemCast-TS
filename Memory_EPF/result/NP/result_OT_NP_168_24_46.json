        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013-11-19 00:00 to 2013-11-25 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2013-11-26 00:00 to 2013-11-26 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points, 7 days * 24 hours = 168). No missing values in the given data.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) in the input, we must rely on a time series model that uses only the historical prices.\n\n 3. Given the daily and weekly seasonality in electricity prices, we can use a model that captures these patterns. However, note that the data provided is only for 7 days, so we have limited history.\n\n 4. We can use a simple approach: \n    - Calculate the average daily profile for the weekdays (Monday to Friday) and the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) because the pattern on weekends is different.\n\n 5. But note: \n    - 2013-11-19 (Tuesday) to 2013-11-22 (Friday) are weekdays.\n    - 2013-11-23 and 2013-11-24 are weekend (Saturday and Sunday).\n    - 2013-11-25 is a Monday.\n\n 6. The next day is 2013-11-26, which is a Tuesday.\n\n 7. We can compute the average hourly profile for the weekdays that are Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2013-11-19) in the data. Alternatively, we can average all weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and then adjust for the day of the week.\n\n 8. However, note that the weekdays might have different patterns. Since we have only one full week, we can do:\n\n    Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday, 2013-11-19) as a base and adjust with the recent trend.\n\n    Option 2: Average the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and use that as a typical weekday pattern.\n\n 9. But we also note that the last day (Monday, 2013-11-25) has a different pattern? We can compare Monday to the previous weekdays.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, given the seasonality, we can decompose the series and then forecast.\n\n 11. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we can do:\n\n     - Calculate the average hourly profile for the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and for the weekend (Saturday, Sunday). We have:\n        Weekdays: 2013-11-19 (Tue), 2013-11-20 (Wed), 2013-11-21 (Thu), 2013-11-22 (Fri) -> 4 days\n        Weekend: 2013-11-23 (Sat), 2013-11-24 (Sun) -> 2 days\n        Monday: 2013-11-25 (Mon) -> 1 day\n\n     - Since 2013-11-26 is a Tuesday, we can use the average of the previous Tuesday (2013-11-19) and the average of the other weekdays? But note that the Monday (2013-11-25) might be more recent and have a similar pattern to the next day? However, Tuesdays might be more similar to previous Tuesday than to Monday.\n\n 12. We can also consider a weighted average where more recent days have higher weights.\n\n 13. However, a simpler approach: use the average of the four weekdays (Tue-Fri) for the 24-hour profile, but then adjust by the overall level of the last day (Monday) relative to the average of the previous weekdays.\n\n 14. Steps for the simple average method for a typical Tuesday:\n\n      a. Extract the 24-hour profile for each weekday (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) and the Monday.\n\n      b. Compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) over the four weekdays.\n\n      c. Compute the average of the entire Monday (average of 24 hours) and the average of the entire four weekdays (each day averaged then average of the four daily averages).\n\n      d. Then, the forecast for Tuesday could be: \n          hourly_profile = average_weekday_hourly_profile * (Monday_daily_average / average_weekday_daily_average)\n\n      But note: we are trying to capture the level of the most recent day (Monday) and apply the typical Tuesday pattern? However, we don't have a Tuesday pattern separately.\n\n 15. Alternatively, we can use the profile from the previous Tuesday (2013-11-19) and adjust it by the ratio of the Monday (2013-11-25) to the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n 16. Since we don't have the previous Monday, we can adjust the entire week by the overall level of the last day.\n\n 17. Another idea: use the average of the four weekdays (Tue-Fri) as the base pattern, and then adjust each hour by the ratio of the last day (Monday) at the same hour to the average of the same hour in the weekdays? But that would be:\n\n        forecast_hour_i = (average_weekday_hour_i) * (monday_hour_i / average_weekday_hour_i)   -> which is just monday_hour_i? That doesn't make sense.\n\n 18. Instead, we can compute the average of the entire week (7 days) and then the average of the last day (Monday). Then we can adjust the typical Tuesday profile by the ratio of Monday's average to the overall average? \n\n 19. However, we are forecasting Tuesday, so we should use the typical Tuesday profile and adjust by the recent trend. The recent trend can be captured by the change from the previous week to the current Monday.\n\n 20. We can compute:\n\n        base_profile = average of the four weekdays (Tue-Fri) for each hour.\n\n        overall_avg_weekdays = average of all the 96 data points (4 days * 24 hours) of weekdays.\n\n        monday_avg = average of the 24 hours of Monday.\n\n        Then, the forecast for Tuesday for hour i: \n            forecast_i = base_profile[i] * (monday_avg / overall_avg_weekdays)\n\n 21. But note: the base_profile is the typical pattern for a weekday, and we are scaling it by how much the Monday (the most recent day) deviates from the typical weekday level.\n\n 22. However, Monday might have a different pattern than Tuesday? But without more data, we assume the shape is similar and only the level changes.\n\n 23. Let's do:\n\n        Weekdays (Tue-Fri): \n            days: 19,20,21,22 (Nov)\n        Monday: 25 Nov.\n\n        Step 1: Compute the average for each hour (0-23) from the four weekdays.\n        Step 2: Compute the overall average of the four weekdays (average of the 96 values).\n        Step 3: Compute the average of Monday (25 Nov) over 24 hours.\n\n        Step 4: scaling factor = monday_avg / overall_avg_weekdays\n\n        Step 5: forecast for each hour i in [0,23] for Tuesday: \n                 = base_profile[i] * scaling_factor\n\n 24. But note: the data for Monday (25 Nov) is:\n\n        2013/11/25 0:00 34.23\n        2013/11/25 1:00 33.97\n        2013/11/25 2:00 33.80\n        2013/11/25 3:00 33.96\n        2013/11/25 4:00 34.94\n        2013/11/25 5:00 36.32\n        2013/11/25 6:00 39.56\n        2013/11/25 7:00 48.11\n        2013/11/25 8:00 48.78\n        2013/11/25 9:00 44.08\n        2013/11/25 10:00 40.31\n        2013/11/25 11:00 39.57\n        2013/11/25 12:00 39.66\n        2013/11/25 13:00 42.55\n        2013/11/25 14:00 44.50\n        2013/11/25 15:00 45.91\n        2013/11/25 16:00 48.31\n        2013/11/25 17:00 52.22\n        2013/11/25 18:00 45.92\n        2013/11/25 19:00 43.47\n        2013/11/25 20:00 40.90\n        2013/11/25 21:00 39.93\n        2013/11/25 22:00 37.61\n        2013/11/25 23:00 35.85\n\n        The average for Monday = (sum of above 24 numbers) / 24.\n\n 25. Let's calculate:\n\n        Monday_avg = (34.23+33.97+33.80+33.96+34.94+36.32+39.56+48.11+48.78+44.08+40.31+39.57+39.66+42.55+44.50+45.91+48.31+52.22+45.92+43.47+40.90+39.93+37.61+35.85) / 24\n\n        We can compute: \n          34.23+33.97 = 68.2\n          68.2+33.80 = 102.0\n          102.0+33.96 = 135.96\n          135.96+34.94 = 170.9\n          170.9+36.32 = 207.22\n          207.22+39.56 = 246.78\n          246.78+48.11 = 294.89\n          294.89+48.78 = 343.67\n          343.67+44.08 = 387.75\n          387.75+40.31 = 428.06\n          428.06+39.57 = 467.63\n          467.63+39.66 = 507.29\n          507.29+42.55 = 549.84\n          549.84+44.50 = 594.34\n          594.34+45.91 = 640.25\n          640.25+48.31 = 688.56\n          688.56+52.22 = 740.78\n          740.78+45.92 = 786.7\n          786.7+43.47 = 830.17\n          830.17+40.90 = 871.07\n          871.07+39.93 = 911.0\n          911.0+37.61 = 948.61\n          948.61+35.85 = 984.46\n\n        Monday_avg = 984.46 / 24 = 41.0191666667\n\n 26. Now, compute the overall average for the four weekdays (Tue 19th, Wed 20th, Thu 21st, Fri 22nd). We have 24 hours each.\n\n        We have the data for these days.

However, note that the method we used is a constant pattern scaled by the most recent day's average. This might not capture the intraday dynamics perfectly, but it is a simple and common approach.\n\n 35.

We write the forecast accordingly.\n\n Note: This is a simple method and in practice more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, LSTM, or using exogenous variables) would be used. But given the constraints, we use this approach.\n",
