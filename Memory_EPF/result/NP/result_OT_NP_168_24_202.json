        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-11-15 00:00 to 2016-11-21 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-11-22 00:00 to 2016-11-22 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on a time series forecasting method.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) without any missing entries. So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily seasonality (24 hours) and weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, capturing weekly seasonality might be challenging.\n\n 3. Given the short-term forecast horizon (24 hours) and the data at hand, we can use a model that captures:\n    - Trend: The data doesn't show a strong long-term trend over the week, but there might be daily patterns.\n    - Seasonality: Strong daily pattern (24-hour cycle) is evident.\n\n 4. We can use a simple seasonal naive method, but that would just repeat the previous day's pattern. However, we have a full week of data and we might notice that weekdays and weekends have different patterns.\n\n 5. Since the last day in the data (2016-11-21) is a Monday, and the next day (2016-11-22) is a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2016-11-15) and adjust for any recent trend.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) that accounts for seasonality. But without the ability to fit a model (as we are in a text-based environment), we need a simple approach.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the previous days (especially the same day of the week) and adjust by the most recent day's deviation.\n\n 8. However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (which we don't have) and provide a forecast.\n\n 9: We can use a moving window of the same hour over the last few days. Since we have 7 days, we can take the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. But the pattern on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) is different from weekdays.\n\n 10. Let's break down the days:\n     - 2016-11-15: Tuesday\n     - 2016-11-16: Wednesday\n     - 2016-11-17: Thursday\n     - 2016-11-18: Friday\n     - 2016-11-19: Saturday\n     - 2016-11-20: Sunday\n     - 2016-11-21: Monday\n\n 11. The next day is 2016-11-22: Tuesday). So we can use the previous Tuesday (2016-11-15) as a base and then adjust by the overall change from the previous day (Monday 2016-11-21) to the current pattern? \n\n 12. Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for the weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and then adjust by the ratio of the last Monday to the average of the previous Mondays? But we only have one Monday.\n\n 13. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, a simpler method is to use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. But note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) have lower prices.\n\n 14. We can also consider the last 3 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) and the last Monday? But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n 15. Another approach: use the previous day (Monday) and the same day a week ago (Tuesday) and take a weighted average? \n\n 16. We can try: \n     Forecast for hour h on Tuesday = (Price of hour h on previous Tuesday + Price of hour h on the previous day (Monday) * 2) / 3 \n     Why? Because the most recent day (Monday) might be more relevant, but we give it double weight.\n\n 17. But note: the previous Tuesday is 7 days ago and the Monday is 1 day ago.\n\n 18. Alternatively, we can use a linear combination of the same day last week and the last day. Let:\n      F(t) = a * (last week same hour) + (1-a) * (yesterday same hour)\n\n 19. How to choose a? We can look at the overall pattern. But without a way to optimize, we can set a=0.5.\n\n 20. However, we can also look at the average change from last week Tuesday to this week Monday? \n\n 21. Let me compute the average price for the last Tuesday (2016-11-15) and the last Monday (2016-11-21):\n      Tuesday (2016-11-15): \n          average = (33.70+33.06+...+35.55)/24 = (let me calculate roughly: \n          I see the prices range from 32.90 to 43.56, and the average is around 38.5? We don't need exact, but for adjustment)\n\n      Monday (2016-11-21): \n          average = (32.13+30.96+...+33.35)/24 -> from 30.28 to 42.74, average around 37.5?\n\n 22. Actually, we can compute exactly:\n\n      Tuesday 2016-11-15: \n          Sum = 33.70+33.06+32.90+32.94+34.11+35.82+39.40+42.09+42.40+42.54+40.86+40.98+40.62+40.78+40.12+41.10+42.31+43.56+42.33+40.45+39.48+38.72+37.54+35.55\n          = 920.05\n          Average = 920.05 / 24 = 38.3354\n\n      Monday 2016-11-21:\n          Sum = 32.13+30.96+30.75+30.28+31.54+34.00+37.18+40.63+41.33+41.36+40.07+40.32+41.01+41.15+41.23+41.32+41.97+42.74+40.71+37.99+36.80+35.39+34.27+33.35\n          = 882.77\n          Average = 882.77 / 24 = 36.7821\n\n      The average price of Monday is about 36.78, and Tuesday last week was 38.33. So there is a drop.\n\n 23. We can adjust the last Tuesday's pattern by the ratio of the Monday's average to the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n 24. Alternatively, we can adjust by the overall trend from last Tuesday to this Monday? The trend factor = (Monday average) / (last Tuesday average) = 36.7821 / 38.3354 \u2248 0.9595.\n\n 25. Then our forecast for the next Tuesday (2016-11-22) for hour h would be:\n        F(h) = (last Tuesday at hour h) * (trend factor)\n\n 26. But this ignores the recent day (Monday). We might want to incorporate the recent day as well.\n\n 27. Another idea: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and adjust it by the typical Tuesday/Monday ratio from the previous week? \n\n 28. We have the previous week:\n        Monday: we don't have (because our data starts on Tuesday 2016-11-15)\n        So we cannot compute the Tuesday/Monday ratio for the previous week.\n\n 29. Given the constraints, we decide to use a combination of the same hour from the previous Tuesday and the same hour from the previous day (Monday) with a weight that favors the recent day.\n\n 30. We choose: \n        F(h) = 0.3 * (last Tuesday at hour h) + 0.7 * (last Monday at hour h)\n\n 31. Why 0.7 for Monday? Because the most recent day is more indicative of the current state.\n\n 32. But note: the day of the week effect: Tuesday might be more similar to last Tuesday than to Monday. However, without more data, we rely on the recent day.\n\n 33. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for all the weekdays we have (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and then adjust by the ratio of the last day (Monday) to the average of the previous Mondays? But we only have one Monday.\n\n 34. Given the simplicity, we choose the weighted average of the same hour from the last Tuesday and the last Monday.\n\n 35. Weights: We choose 0.4 for last Tuesday and 0.6 for last Monday? Or 0.3 and 0.7? Let's try 0.3 and 0.7.\n\n 36. We'll do:\n        For hour 0:00: 0.3 * (price of 2016-11-15 0:00) + 0.7 * (price of 2016-11-21 0:00)\n                   = 0.3*33.70 + 0.7*32.13 = 10.11 + 22.491 = 32.601\n\n 37. But we can also consider that the pattern on Tuesday might be different from Monday. Since we have only one Tuesday in the past, we cannot compute a reliable average. \n\n 38. Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and the last Monday? But we are forecasting a Tuesday, so we can take the average of the same hour for the previous Tuesday and the previous Wednesday? \n\n 39. Actually, we have:\n        Tuesday (2016-11-15)\n        Wednesday (2016-11-16)\n        Thursday (2016-11-17)\n        Friday (2016-11-18)\n\n     and then the weekend (2016-11-19 and 2016-11-20) and Monday (2016-11-21).\n\n 40. For forecasting Tuesday, we can take the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday? But note that Friday might be different because it's before the weekend.\n\n 41. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last four weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) and then adjust by the ratio of the last Monday to the average of the previous week's Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n 42. Given the complexity and the fact that we are limited, we choose to use the average of the same hour for the last four weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) and the last Monday? But that would be 5 days. However, the Monday is the most recent and might be more relevant.\n\n 43. We can do: \n        F(h) = (last Monday at hour h + last Tuesday at hour h + last Wednesday at hour h + last Thursday at hour h + last Friday at hour h) / 5\n\n 44. But note: the last Monday is 2016-11-21, last Tuesday is 2016-11-15, etc. They are not consecutive in time? Actually, they are consecutive in the sense of the same hour.\n\n 45. However, the last Tuesday is 7 days ago, and the last Monday is 1 day ago. We might want to give more weight to the recent days.\n\n 46. We can use a weighted average: \n        Monday (1 day ago): weight 5\n        Tuesday (7 days ago): weight 1\n        Wednesday (6 days ago): weight 1\n        Thursday (5 days ago): weight 1\n        Friday (4 days ago): weight 1\n\n     Then F(h) = (5 * Mon_h + 1 * Tue_h + 1 * Wed_h + 1 * Thu_h + 1 * Fri_h) / (5+1+1+1+1) = (5*Mon_h + Tue_h + Wed_h + Thu_h + Fri_h) / 9\n\n 47. This gives more weight to the most recent day (Monday) and then the same weight to the same day of the week for the previous week.\n\n 48. Let's test for hour 0:00:\n        Mon (2016-11-21 0:00): 32.13\n        Tue (2016-11-15 0:00): 33.70\n        Wed (2016-11-16 0:00): 34.97\n        Thu (2016-11-17 0:00): 31.62\n        Fri (2016-11-18 0:00): 32.88\n\n        F(0:00) = (5*32.13 + 33.70 + 34.97 + 31.62 + 32.88) / 9 \n                 = (160.65 + 33.70+34.97+31.62+32.88) / 9\n                 = 160.65 + 133.17 = 293.82 / 9 = 32.6467\n\n 49. This seems reasonable.\n\n 50. We'll use this method for each hour.\n\n 51. But note: the data for the last four weekdays (Tue to Fri) and the last Monday are all we have for weekdays? And we are forecasting a Tuesday.\n\n 52. We'll compute for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n 53. Let me write down the data we need:\n\n    Hour 0: \n        Mon: 32.13 (2016-11-21 0:00)\n        Tue: 33.70 (2016-11-15 0:00)\n        Wed: 34.97 (2016-11-16 0:00)\n        Thu: 31.62 (2016-11-17 0:00)\n        Fri: 32.88 (2016-11-18 0:00)\n\n    Hour 1:\n        Mon: 30.96\n        Tue: 33.06\n        Wed: 34.23\n        Thu: 31.07\n        Fri: 31.27\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n 54. We'll compute for each hour.\n\n 55. However, note that the last Monday (2016-11-21) is included, and the previous weekdays (Tue 15, Wed 16, Thu 17, Fri 18) are included.\n\n 56. We must be cautious: the weekend is not included because we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday) and we are using only weekdays and the immediate past Monday (which is a weekday).\n\n 57. Let's do the calculation for all 24 hours.\n\n 58. We'll create a list for the forecast:\n\n        Hour 0: (5*32.13 + 33.70 + 34.97 + 31.62 + 32.88) / 9 = (160.65 + 33.70+34.97+31.62+32.88)=160.65+133.17=293.82 -> 293.82/9 = 32.6467 -> 32.65\n        Hour 1: (5*30.96 + 33.06 + 34.23 + 31.07 + 31.27) / 9 = (154.80 + 33.06+34.23+31.07+31.27)=154.80+129.63=284.43 -> 284.43/9=31.6033 -> 31.60\n        ... \n\n 59. We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 60. But note: the input has two decimal places.\n\n 61. Let me do the calculations in a programmatic way (but we are doing by hand for each hour? that's 24 hours). We can do it step by step.\n\n 62. Alternatively, we can write a small table.\n\n 63. However, since we are a text-based response, we'll compute the forecast for each hour.\n\n 64. We'll list the historical data for each hour:\n\n    Hour | Mon (21st) | Tue (15th) | Wed (16th) | Thu (17th) | Fri (18th) | Forecast\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      0  |   32.13    |   33.70    |   34.97    |   31.62    |   32.88    | (5*32.13 + 33.70+34.97+31.62+32.88)/9 = (160.65+133.17)/9=293.82/9=32.6467 -> 32.65\n      1  |   30.96    |   33.06    |   34.23    |   31.07    |   31.27    | (5*30.96=154.80) + (33.06+34.23+31.07+31.27)=129.63 -> 284.43/9=31.6033 -> 31.60\n      2  |   30.75    |   32.90    |   33.80    |   31.00    |   30.28    | (5*30.75=153.75) + (32.90+33.80+31.00+30.28)=128.98 -> 282.73/9=31.4144 -> 31.41\n      3  |   30.28    |   32.94    |   34.03    |   31.35    |   31.01    | (5*30.28=151.40) + (32.94+34.03+31.35+31.01)=129.33 -> 280.73/9=31.1922 -> 31.19\n      4  |   31.54    |   34.11    |   35.35    |   32.21    |   32.39    | (5*31.54=157.70) + (34.11+35.35+32.21+32.39)=134.06 -> 291.76/9=32.4178 -> 32.42\n      5  |   34.00    |   35.82    |   37.96    |   34.89    |   34.04    | (5*34.00=170.00) + (35.82+37.96+34.89+34.04)=142.71 -> 312.71/9=34.7456 -> 34.75\n      6  |   37.18    |   39.40    |   41.68    |   38.26    |   36.06    | (5*37.18=185.90) + (39.40+41.68+38.26+36.06)=155.40 -> 341.30/9=37.9222 -> 37.92\n      7  |   40.63    |   42.09    |   44.58    |   40.33    |   39.26    | (5*40.63=203.15) + (42.09+44.58+40.33+39.26)=166.26 -> 369.41/9=41.0456 -> 41.05\n      8  |   41.33    |   42.40    |   45.22    |   41.03    |   39.47    | (5*41.33=206.65) + (42.40+45.22+41.03+39.47)=168.12 -> 374.77/9=41.6411 -> 41.64\n      9  |   41.36    |   42.54    |   43.96    |   40.62    |   39.29    | (5*41.36=206.80) + (42.54+43.96+40.62+39.29)=166.41 -> 373.21/9=41.4678 -> 41.47\n      10 |   40.07    |   40.86    |   41.49    |   39.93    |   38.04    | (5*40.07=200.35) + (40.86+41.49+39.93+38.04)=160.32 -> 360.67/9=40.0744 -> 40.07\n      11 |   40.32    |   40.98    |   41.24    |   39.88    |   37.88    | (5*40.32=201.60) + (40.98+41.24+39.88+37.88)=159.98 -> 361.58/9=40.1756 -> 40.18\n      12 |   41.01    |   40.62    |   41.64    |   39.83    |   37.99    | (5*41.01=205.05) + (40.62+41.64+39.83+37.99)=160.08 -> 365.13/9=40.5700 -> 40.57\n      13 |   41.15    |   40.78    |   41.12    |   39.68    |   37.86    | (5*41.15=205.75) + (40.78+41.12+39.68+37.86)=159.44 -> 365.19/9=40.5767 -> 40.58\n      14 |   41.23    |   40.12    |   40.93    |   39.59    |   37.55    | (5*41.23=206.15) + (40.12+40.93+39.59+37.55)=158.19 -> 364.34/9=40.4822 -> 40.48\n      15 |   41.32    |   41.10    |   41.64    |   39.87    |   38.43    | (5*41.32=206.60) + (41.10+41.64+39.87+38.43)=161.04 -> 367.64/9=40.8489 -> 40.85\n      16 |   41.97    |   42.31    |   41.95    |   40.76    |   39.52    | (5*41.97=209.85) + (42.31+41.95+40.76+39.52)=164.54 -> 374.39/9=41.5989 -> 41.60\n      17 |   42.74    |   43.56    |   41.94    |   41.55    |   39.84    | (5*42.74=213.70) + (43.56+41.94+41.55+39.84)=166.89 -> 380.59/9=42.2878 -> 42.29\n      18 |   40.71    |   42.33    |   40.66    |   40.20    |   38.88    | (5*40.71=203.55) + (42.33+40.66+40.20+38.88)=162.07 -> 365.62/9=40.6244 -> 40.62\n      19 |   37.99    |   40.45    |   39.12    |   38.65    |   36.93    | (5*37.99=189.95) + (40.45+39.12+38.65+36.93)=155.15 -> 345.10/9=38.3444 -> 38.34\n      20 |   36.80    |   39.48    |   38.31    |   37.46    |   35.36    | (5*36.80=184.00) + (39.48+38.31+37.46+35.36)=150.61 -> 334.61/9=37.1789 -> 37.18\n      21 |   35.39    |   38.72    |   37.48    |   36.47    |   34.71    | (5*35.39=176.95) + (38.72+37.48+36.47+34.71)=147.38 -> 324.33/9=36.0367 -> 36.04\n      22 |   34.27    |   37.54    |   36.00    |   35.07    |   33.90    | (5*34.27=171.35) + (37.54+36.00+35.07+33.90)=142.51 -> 313.86/9=34.8733 -> 34.87\n      23 |   33.35    |   35.55    |   33.63    |   33.99    |   32.35    | (5*33.35=166.75) + (35.55+33.63+33.99+32.35)=135.52 -> 302.27/9=33.5856 -> 33.59\n\n 65.

We are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but there were none). We provided the full sequence.\n\n 74. This method is a weighted average of the same hour over the last Monday and the four weekdays of the previous week. We believe it captures the daily pattern and adjusts for the recent trend.\n\n 75.
