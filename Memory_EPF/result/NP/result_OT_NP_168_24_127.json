        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015/6/9 0:00 to 2015/6/15 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015/6/16 0:00 to 2015/6/16 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the observed electricity price (OT). The problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are not provided with that data. Therefore, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the historical time series of prices, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the daily seasonality (24 hours) and the short-term nature (next 24 hours), we can use:\n   - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) or\n   - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or\n   - A simple method like using the average of the same hour from the previous days.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - Daily patterns: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Weekdays vs weekends: we have data from Tuesday (2015/6/9) to Monday (2015/6/15). The last day (2015/6/15) is a Monday, and we are forecasting for Tuesday (2015/6/16).\n\n Considering the data, we can use a simple but effective method: \n   - For each hour of the day (0:00 to 23:00) in the forecast (2015/6/16), we take the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (the entire available history) or a subset (like the same day of the week). However, note that the last 7 days include both weekdays and a weekend.\n\n But note: \n   - 2015/6/9 (Tuesday) to 2015/6/15 (Monday) -> 7 days: 2 Tuesdays? Actually, we have only one Tuesday (2015/6/9) and one Monday (2015/6/15). The day we are forecasting is a Tuesday (2015/6/16).\n\n Since we have only one week of data, we are missing multiple Tuesdays. Therefore, we can use the entire week's same hour average, or we can use a weighted average giving more weight to the most recent days.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average over the same hour for the last 7 days.\n\n Let's do:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) on 2015/6/16, we compute:\n      forecast_h = average of the price at hour h for the days 2015/6/9, 2015/6/10, ... 2015/6/15.\n\n But note: the data for 2015/6/9 (Tuesday) is the same day of the week as 2015/6/16 (Tuesday). However, we have only one Tuesday in the history. So we can also consider:\n\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour over the entire available week (7 days). This might smooth out the weekly pattern.\n\n   Option 2: Use the same-day-of-week average, but we only have one Tuesday. So we can use the Tuesday (2015/6/9) and also include the Monday (2015/6/15) and Sunday (2015/6/14) to have more data points? But that might not be as accurate.\n\n   Option 3: Use a weighted average where the same day of the week (Tuesday) gets the highest weight and then the adjacent days get lower weights.\n\n However, given the simplicity and the fact that we are only asked for a forecast, we will use the simple average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of 2015/6/16:\n\n   Let h be the hour (0 to 23).\n   We have 7 days of data for that hour: \n        day0: 2015/6/9 (Tuesday) at hour h\n        day1: 2015/6/10 (Wednesday) at hour h\n        day2: 2015/6/11 (Thursday) at hour h\n        day3: 2015/6/12 (Friday) at hour h\n        day4: 2015/6/13 (Saturday) at hour h\n        day5: 2015/6/14 (Sunday) at hour h\n        day6: 2015/6/15 (Monday) at hour h\n\n   Then, forecast for 2015/6/16 at hour h = (day0_h + day1_h + ... + day6_h) / 7.\n\n But note: the data for the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) might be lower prices. The day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, so we might want to give more weight to the previous Tuesday and the previous Monday? However, without more Tuesdays, we stick to the 7-day average.\n\n However, let's check the data: \n   For example, at hour 0:00 (midnight) of the 7 days:\n\n      2015/6/9 0:00: 13.74\n      2015/6/10 0:00: 14.97\n      2015/6/11 0:00: 9.07\n      2015/6/12 0:00: 13.10\n      2015/6/13 0:00: 8.54\n      2015/6/14 0:00: 8.51\n      2015/6/15 0:00: 6.10\n\n   Average = (13.74+14.97+9.07+13.10+8.54+8.51+6.10)/7 = 10.5757\n\n   We can round to two decimals: 10.58\n\n   Similarly, we do for every hour.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values. In this case, there are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n However, if there were missing values, we would have to impute them. Since we are not given any, we proceed.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00 for 2015/6/16.\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the average.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We have 168 data points. We can group by the hour of the day (0-23) and then take the average for each hour across the 7 days.\n\n   We note the data is in order, so:\n\n        hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144\n        hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73, 97, 121, 145\n        ... and so on.\n\n   We can extract the values for each hour and then compute the mean.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        hour0_vals = [13.74, 14.97, 9.07, 13.10, 8.54, 8.51, 6.10] -> mean = 10.58 (rounded to 2 decimals)\n\n   We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n Let's calculate:\n\n   Hour 0: [13.74, 14.97, 9.07, 13.10, 8.54, 8.51, 6.10] -> sum=74.03 -> mean=74.03/7=10.5757 -> 10.58\n   Hour 1: [12.62, 14.16, 8.13, 11.57, 6.81, 7.46, 4.60] -> sum=65.35 -> mean=9.3357 -> 9.34\n   Hour 2: [12.54, 13.23, 7.40, 10.69, 5.79, 6.38, 4.23] -> sum=60.26 -> mean=8.6086 -> 8.61\n   Hour 3: [12.46, 12.73, 8.38, 9.45, 5.27, 5.45, 4.12] -> sum=57.86 -> mean=8.2657 -> 8.27\n   Hour 4: [12.57, 12.85, 9.10, 9.89, 4.99, 4.78, 4.42] -> sum=58.60 -> mean=8.3714 -> 8.37\n   Hour 5: [14.46, 14.29, 11.58, 12.93, 5.60, 4.71, 7.90] -> sum=71.47 -> mean=10.21 -> 10.21\n   Hour 6: [19.98, 16.80, 15.85, 14.83, 7.47, 5.68, 12.63] -> sum=93.24 -> mean=13.32 -> 13.32\n   Hour 7: [25.95, 23.07, 21.63, 19.91, 9.52, 7.00, 14.66] -> sum=121.74 -> mean=17.3914 -> 17.39\n   Hour 8: [26.28, 24.77, 23.24, 21.24, 11.49, 8.53, 19.30] -> sum=134.85 -> mean=19.2643 -> 19.26\n   Hour 9: [25.98, 24.17, 22.63, 20.97, 12.73, 9.81, 19.93] -> sum=136.22 -> mean=19.46 -> 19.46\n   Hour 10: [25.50, 23.87, 20.59, 20.74, 13.23, 10.91, 20.42] -> sum=135.26 -> mean=19.3229 -> 19.32\n   Hour 11: [25.22, 23.34, 20.43, 19.98, 13.16, 10.91, 19.38] -> sum=132.42 -> mean=18.9171 -> 18.92\n   Hour 12: [23.86, 21.63, 19.80, 19.03, 12.67, 9.89, 16.84] -> sum=123.72 -> mean=17.6743 -> 17.67\n   Hour 13: [22.21, 20.10, 18.75, 17.08, 11.96, 8.92, 16.16] -> sum=115.18 -> mean=16.4543 -> 16.45\n   Hour 14: [21.57, 19.07, 19.87, 15.83, 11.39, 8.46, 15.42] -> sum=111.61 -> mean=15.9443 -> 15.94\n   Hour 15: [20.04, 17.46, 19.81, 14.62, 11.03, 8.02, 14.53] -> sum=105.51 -> mean=15.0729 -> 15.07\n   Hour 16: [19.29, 15.36, 18.96, 14.53, 11.10, 7.46, 13.67] -> sum=100.37 -> mean=14.3386 -> 14.34\n   Hour 17: [18.69, 15.05, 18.76, 14.49, 11.70, 8.26, 13.60] -> sum=100.55 -> mean=14.3643 -> 14.36\n   Hour 18: [18.48, 15.09, 18.75, 14.39, 11.74, 9.13, 13.39] -> sum=100.97 -> mean=14.4243 -> 14.42\n   Hour 19: [16.40, 14.89, 17.99, 14.37, 11.19, 8.97, 13.15] -> sum=96.96 -> mean=13.8514 -> 13.85\n   Hour 20: [15.57, 14.64, 17.50, 14.13, 11.02, 8.69, 13.06] -> sum=94.61 -> mean=13.5157 -> 13.52\n   Hour 21: [15.09, 14.55, 17.34, 13.41, 10.66, 8.70, 13.14] -> sum=92.89 -> mean=13.27 -> 13.27\n   Hour 22: [13.97, 14.29, 15.73, 13.29, 10.63, 8.58, 12.81] -> sum=89.30 -> mean=12.7571 -> 12.76\n   Hour 23: [12.67, 12.95, 14.05, 11.49, 8.87, 7.12, 11.40] -> sum=78.55 -> mean=11.2214 -> 11.22\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2015/6/16:\n\n   0:00: 10.58\n   1:00: 9.34\n   2:00: 8.61\n   3:00: 8.27\n   4:00: 8.37\n   5:00: 10.21\n   6:00: 13.32\n   7:00: 17.39\n   8:00: 19.26\n   9:00: 19.46\n   10:00: 19.32\n   11:00: 18.92\n   12:00: 17.67\n   13:00: 16.45\n   14:00: 15.94\n   15:00: 15.07\n   16:00: 14.34\n   17:00: 14.36\n   18:00: 14.42\n   19:00: 13.85\n   20:00: 13.52\n   21:00: 13.27\n   22:00: 12.76\n   23:00: 11.22\n\n We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: This is a simple average method.
