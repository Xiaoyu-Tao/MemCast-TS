        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016-10-11 00:00 to 2016-10-17 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-10-18 00:00 to 2016-10-18 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and the dates. We are not given the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts, so we cannot use them. We must rely solely on the time series of observed prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the price time series, we can use a time series forecasting method. Given the daily seasonality (evident from the data: prices are lower at night and higher during the day) and the short-term nature (24 hours ahead), we can use a model that captures seasonality.\n\n However, note that the problem states we are an expert and we are to handle missing values, but there are none in the provided data. We are to forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n Given the constraints, we are to provide a forecast for the next 24 hours. We can use a simple method such as:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the same day of the previous week (since we have 7 days of data, we can use the values from 2016-10-11 to 2016-10-17 to forecast 2016-10-18, which is a Tuesday?).\n\n But note: \n   - 2016-10-11 was a Tuesday, 2016-10-18 is the next Tuesday? Actually, 2016-10-11 (Tuesday) to 2016-10-17 (Monday). So 2016-10-18 is a Tuesday.\n\n However, we note that the pattern of a Tuesday might be similar to the previous Tuesday? But we have only one Tuesday in the data (2016-10-11). Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But the data shows a weekly pattern? We have only one week of data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model (like Holt-Winters) or an ARIMA model. However, without the ability to run complex models in this environment, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n But note: the data shows a clear daily pattern and also a weekly pattern? We have only 7 days, so we can try to capture the daily pattern by averaging the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n However, the problem is that the weekdays and weekends have different patterns. We note that the last day in the data (2016-10-17) is a Monday, and the day we are forecasting (2016-10-18) is a Tuesday. We have one Tuesday in the data (2016-10-11). We can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday? But that might be too old. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would include weekends which are different.\n\n Since we have only one week of data, and the next day is a Tuesday, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016-10-11) as a naive forecast? But let's see the data: \n\n For example, the price at 00:00 on 2016-10-11 was 29.04, but the next days at 00:00 were: \n   2016-10-12: 28.88\n   2016-10-13: 29.50\n   2016-10-14: 28.69\n   2016-10-15: 28.14\n   2016-10-16: 29.90\n   2016-10-17: 29.72\n\n The average of 00:00 over the last 7 days: \n   (29.04 + 28.88 + 29.50 + 28.69 + 28.14 + 29.90 + 29.72) / 7 = 29.124\n\n But note: the last 7 days include two weekend days (15th and 16th are Saturday and Sunday). The next day (18th) is a Tuesday, so we might want to use only the weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last 3 days? Or we can use an exponential smoothing for each hour.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (which we don't have) and provide a forecast.\n\n Since we are to provide a forecast without any external tools, we can use a simple method: \n   - We note that the data has a daily seasonality of 24 hours. We can use a seasonal naive forecast: using the same hour from the previous day? But the previous day (Monday) might be different from Tuesday.\n\n But the previous day (Monday, 2016-10-17) is the last day we have. We can use that as a naive forecast? But the pattern of Tuesday might be different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays? But we don't have the day of the week in the data.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (which includes both weekdays and weekends) for the forecast. This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out some noise.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   For hour h (0 to 23) of 2016-10-18, we take the average of the price at hour h for the days 2016-10-11, 2016-10-12, 2016-10-13, 2016-10-14, 2016-10-15, 2016-10-16, 2016-10-17.\n\n Example for hour 0: \n   h0: (29.04 + 28.88 + 29.50 + 28.69 + 28.14 + 29.90 + 29.72) / 7 = 29.124 -> round to 2 decimals: 29.12\n\n But note: the data has two decimals.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the last three days (15,16,17) are weekend and Monday? 15th is Saturday, 16th Sunday, 17th Monday. The 18th is Tuesday. We might want to use only the previous Tuesdays? But we have one.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous week (2016-10-11) and then adjust by the recent trend? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have to provide an answer, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for each hour:\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and take the average of the 7 values we have for that hour.\n\n But note: the data starts at 2016-10-11 00:00 and ends at 2016-10-17 23:00. We have 7 days, each with 24 hours.\n\n We can restructure the data by hour:\n\n   hour0: [29.04, 28.88, 29.50, 28.69, 28.14, 29.90, 29.72]\n   hour1: [28.73, 28.32, 28.93, 28.20, 27.53, 29.44, 29.24]\n   ... and so on.\n\n Then for each hour, we compute the average.\n\n However, note that the data for the same hour might have a trend? But we are taking the average to smooth.\n\n Let's do the calculation:\n\n   hour0: (29.04 + 28.88 + 29.50 + 28.69 + 28.14 + 29.90 + 29.72) / 7 = \n        29.04+28.88 = 57.92\n        57.92+29.50 = 87.42\n        87.42+28.69 = 116.11\n        116.11+28.14 = 144.25\n        144.25+29.90 = 174.15\n        174.15+29.72 = 203.87\n        203.87 / 7 = 29.124 -> 29.12\n\n   hour1: [28.73, 28.32, 28.93, 28.20, 27.53, 29.44, 29.24]\n        28.73+28.32 = 57.05\n        57.05+28.93 = 85.98\n        85.98+28.20 = 114.18\n        114.18+27.53 = 141.71\n        141.71+29.44 = 171.15\n        171.15+29.24 = 200.39\n        200.39 / 7 = 28.627 -> 28.63\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n But note: the data for the weekend (15th and 16th) might be lower? and the weekdays higher? So the average might be a compromise.\n\n Alternatively, we could use only the last 3 days? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to use our expertise, I choose the 7-day average as it captures the entire week and smooths out daily variations.\n\n However, note that the next day is a Tuesday and we have only one Tuesday in the average. We might get a better result by using a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days? But again, without more information, we use the simple average.\n\n Let's compute the 24 hours:\n\n We'll create a list for each hour index (0 to 23) and then compute the average.\n\n We note the data is given in order, so:\n\n   hour0: indices 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144\n   hour1: indices 1, 25, 49, 73, 97, 121, 145\n   ...\n   hour23: indices 23, 47, 71, 95, 119, 143, 167\n\n We can extract these and compute.\n\n We'll do it step by step for each hour.\n\n However, to save time, we can write a small program in thought, but we are to reason step by step.\n\n We'll compute the averages:\n\n   hour0: [29.04, 28.88, 29.50, 28.69, 28.14, 29.90, 29.72] -> 29.12\n   hour1: [28.73, 28.32, 28.93, 28.20, 27.53, 29.44, 29.24] -> 28.63\n   hour2: [28.47, 28.12, 28.48, 27.99, 27.27, 29.33, 28.93] -> 28.37\n   hour3: [28.52, 28.25, 28.54, 28.07, 27.15, 29.21, 28.36] -> 28.30\n   hour4: [28.85, 28.77, 29.07, 28.44, 27.10, 29.26, 29.01] -> 28.79\n   hour5: [29.61, 30.00, 30.77, 30.06, 27.74, 29.47, 30.37] -> 29.57\n   hour6: [31.61, 32.33, 34.26, 32.36, 28.51, 29.90, 33.18] -> 31.74\n   hour7: [35.50, 36.71, 37.91, 35.52, 29.17, 30.41, 34.85] -> 34.30\n   hour8: [35.49, 37.36, 39.42, 36.55, 29.73, 30.95, 35.58] -> 35.01\n   hour9: [35.47, 36.71, 38.48, 35.47, 30.63, 31.39, 35.31] -> 34.78\n   hour10: [34.88, 35.51, 37.79, 34.71, 30.71, 31.90, 35.02] -> 34.22\n   hour11: [34.07, 35.61, 36.55, 33.10, 30.93, 32.00, 34.96] -> 33.89\n   hour12: [33.91, 35.25, 35.64, 32.64, 30.54, 31.49, 34.49] -> 33.42\n   hour13: [33.79, 35.21, 35.65, 31.71, 30.47, 30.99, 34.80] -> 33.23\n   hour14: [33.08, 34.72, 34.88, 31.21, 30.40, 30.24, 34.21] -> 32.68\n   hour15: [32.76, 33.95, 34.09, 31.20, 30.43, 30.34, 34.12] -> 32.41\n   hour16: [32.84, 33.94, 33.97, 31.10, 30.62, 30.82, 33.98] -> 32.47\n   hour17: [34.08, 35.68, 34.87, 32.43, 31.39, 32.24, 34.93] -> 33.66\n   hour18: [34.94, 35.88, 35.77, 33.21, 32.51, 33.49, 35.89] -> 34.53\n   hour19: [35.29, 36.85, 35.60, 33.10, 32.19, 33.45, 35.77] -> 34.61\n   hour20: [32.32, 34.42, 33.73, 31.00, 31.37, 32.29, 33.59] -> 32.53\n   hour21: [30.92, 32.51, 31.93, 30.04, 30.84, 31.03, 32.25] -> 31.36\n   hour22: [29.98, 31.38, 30.35, 29.22, 30.44, 30.29, 31.94] -> 30.51\n   hour23: [29.27, 29.94, 29.27, 28.44, 29.84, 29.26, 30.78] -> 29.54\n\n Now, we round each to two decimal places.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2016-10-18:\n\n   00:00: 29.12\n   01:00: 28.63\n   02:00: 28.37\n   03:00: 28.30\n   04:00: 28.79\n   05:00: 29.57\n   06:00: 31.74\n   07:00: 34.30\n   08:00: 35.01\n   09:00: 34.78\n   10:00: 34.22\n   11:00: 33.89\n   12:00: 33.42\n   13:00: 33.23\n   14:00: 32.68\n   15:00: 32.41\n   16:00: 32.47\n   17:00: 33.66\n   18:00: 34.53\n   19:00: 34.61\n   20:00: 32.53\n   21:00: 31.36\n   22:00: 30.51\n   23:00: 29.54\n\n We must output in the same format as the historical data, but for the next 24 hours starting from 2016-10-18 00:00.\n\n Format:\n   date (as \"YYYY/MM/DD H:MM\") and the forecasted OT.\n\n Note: the date format in the input uses a space and then the hour without leading zero for the hour?
