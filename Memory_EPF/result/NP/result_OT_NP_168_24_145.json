        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-10/13 00:00 to 2015/10/19 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015/10/20 00:00 to 2015/10/20 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). But we are told that some data may contain missing values. However, in the given data, there are no missing values in the provided time range.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n\n 3. Given the hourly data and the clear daily seasonality (prices rise during the day and drop at night) and weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekend), we can use a model that captures these patterns.\n\n 4. We note that the data ends on a Monday (2015/10/19). The next 24 hours will be Tuesday (2015/10/20).\n\n 5. Approach:\n    - We can use a simple method such as seasonal naive (using the same hour of the previous day or same day of the previous week) or a more sophisticated method like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or ARIMA.\n    - However, without the ability to run complex models in this environment, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from the previous days, giving more weight to recent days and the same day of the previous week.\n\n 6. Considering the recent spike on Monday (2015/10/19) which is a weekday, and the fact that Tuesday is also a weekday, we should look at the pattern of the previous weekdays (Monday to Friday) and also the immediate past (Monday).\n\n 7. We note that the data for Monday (2015/10/19) shows unusually high prices during the day (peaking at 44.78 and 46.31) compared to the previous days. This might be due to a special event or condition. Since we don't have additional information, we must rely on the pattern.\n\n 8. Proposed method:\n    - We will use the average of the same hour from the last two days (Sunday and Monday) and the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2015/10/13) to account for weekly seasonality. But note that the previous Tuesday (2015/10/13) is 7 days ago and might be less relevant due to the recent spike.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use:\n        Forecast for hour h on Tuesday = (weight1 * value of hour h on Monday + weight2 * value of hour h on Sunday + weight3 * value of hour h on the previous Tuesday) / (weight1+weight2+weight3)\n\n    Weights: We can assign higher weights to more recent days. For example:\n        Monday (most recent): weight = 3\n        Sunday: weight = 2\n        Previous Tuesday: weight = 1\n\n    But note: The spike on Monday might be an anomaly. However, without knowing the cause, we must assume that the pattern might continue. Alternatively, we can also consider the average of the last three weekdays (Friday, Monday) and the previous Tuesday? But note that Saturday and Sunday are weekends and have different patterns.\n\n    Since the next day is a Tuesday, we can compare with the previous Tuesday (2015/10/13) and also the most recent weekdays (Monday and Friday). However, we note that Monday (2015/10/19) is the most recent and might be the best indicator.\n\n 9. Considering the complexity and the fact that we are not running a model, we can do:\n\n    For each hour h (0 to 23) of 2015/10/20 (Tuesday):\n\n        Let:\n          h_prev_tue = value at hour h on 2015/10/13 (Tuesday)\n          h_mon = value at hour h on 2015/10/19 (Monday)\n          h_sun = value at hour h on 2015/10/18 (Sunday)\n\n        But note: Sunday is a weekend day and Tuesday is a weekday. So we might not want to use Sunday? Instead, we can use the previous Friday (2015/10/16) which is a weekday.\n\n        So let's use:\n          h_prev_tue (2015/10/13)\n          h_fri (2015/10/16)\n          h_mon (2015/10/19)\n\n        Weights: \n          Monday (most recent weekday): 3\n          Friday (next recent weekday): 2\n          Previous Tuesday (same day of the week): 1\n\n        Then, forecast_h = (3*h_mon + 2*h_fri + 1*h_prev_tue) / 6\n\n 10. However, we note the spike on Monday was very high. If we use the above, the forecast for the peak hours (like 8:00 and 17:00) will be high. But we don't know if the spike will continue. Alternatively, we can also consider that the spike might be temporary and the prices might return to normal. But without additional data, we stick to the weighted average.\n\n 11. Let's calculate for one hour to see: For hour 8:00 (which is the 8th hour of the day)\n\n        Previous Tuesday (2015/10/13 8:00): 27.38\n        Friday (2015/10/16 8:00): 26.01\n        Monday (2015/10/19 8:00): 44.78\n\n        Forecast = (3*44.78 + 2*26.01 + 1*27.38) / 6 = (134.34 + 52.02 + 27.38) / 6 = 213.74 / 6 = 35.6233\n\n     This is a high value, but note that on Monday the price was 44.78. So it is a compromise.\n\n 12. We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 13. But note: the data for Monday (2015/10/19) has a very high value at 8:00 and 9:00, and then again at 17:00 and 18:00. We are not sure if this is going to repeat. However, we are using two other days to smooth it.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a median to avoid the effect of extreme spikes? But the problem says we are an expert and we must forecast. The spike might be due to a real event (like low wind or high demand) that might persist.\n\n 15. Since the problem does not provide any exogenous variables for the future, we cannot account for the cause of the spike. So we stick to the weighted average.\n\n 16. Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of 2015/10/20:\n\n        Let:\n          h_prev_tue = OT value for 2015/10/13 at hour h\n          h_fri = OT value for 2015/10/16 at hour h\n          h_mon = OT value for 2015/10/19 at hour h\n\n        Then:\n          forecast = (3 * h_mon + 2 * h_fri + 1 * h_prev_tue) / 6\n\n 17. We round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 18. However, note that the data for Monday (2015/10/19) is the most recent and might be the most relevant. But we are also including Friday and the previous Tuesday to capture the weekly pattern and avoid over-reliance on an outlier.\n\n 19. Let's compute the 24 hours:\n\n    Hour 0: (3*23.13 + 2*22.77 + 1*20.70)/6 = (69.39 + 45.54 + 20.70)/6 = 135.63/6 = 22.605 -> 22.61\n    Hour 1: (3*23.11 + 2*22.47 + 1*20.37)/6 = (69.33 + 44.94 + 20.37)/6 = 134.64/6 = 22.44\n    Hour 2: (3*23.12 + 2*22.38 + 1*20.31)/6 = (69.36 + 44.76 + 20.31)/6 = 134.43/6 = 22.405 -> 22.41\n    Hour 3: (3*23.22 + 2*22.37 + 1*20.36)/6 = (69.66 + 44.74 + 20.36)/6 = 134.76/6 = 22.46\n    Hour 4: (3*23.48 + 2*22.47 + 1*20.72)/6 = (70.44 + 44.94 + 20.72)/6 = 136.10/6 = 22.6833 -> 22.68\n    Hour 5: (3*24.16 + 2*22.81 + 1*21.34)/6 = (72.48 + 45.62 + 21.34)/6 = 139.44/6 = 23.24\n    Hour 6: (3*25.88 + 2*23.04 + 1*22.78)/6 = (77.64 + 46.08 + 22.78)/6 = 146.50/6 = 24.4167 -> 24.42\n    Hour 7: (3*34.92 + 2*23.37 + 1*25.07)/6 = (104.76 + 46.74 + 25.07)/6 = 176.57/6 = 29.4283 -> 29.43\n    Hour 8: (3*44.78 + 2*23.57 + 1*27.38)/6 = (134.34 + 47.14 + 27.38)/6 = 208.86/6 = 34.81\n    Hour 9: (3*39.07 + 2*23.84 + 1*25.90)/6 = (117.21 + 47.68 + 25.90)/6 = 190.79/6 = 31.7983 -> 31.80\n    Hour 10: (3*44.87 + 2*23.80 + 1*25.28)/6 = (134.61 + 47.60 + 25.28)/6 = 207.49/6 = 34.5817 -> 34.58\n    Hour 11: (3*35.93 + 2*23.73 + 1*24.69)/6 = (107.79 + 47.46 + 24.69)/6 = 179.94/6 = 29.99\n    Hour 12: (3*32.24 + 2*23.51 + 1*23.87)/6 = (96.72 + 47.02 + 23.87)/6 = 167.61/6 = 27.935 -> 27.94\n    Hour 13: (3*29.84 + 2*23.29 + 1*23.69)/6 = (89.52 + 46.58 + 23.69)/6 = 159.79/6 = 26.6317 -> 26.63\n    Hour 14: (3*30.03 + 2*23.18 + 1*23.24)/6 = (90.09 + 46.36 + 23.24)/6 = 159.69/6 = 26.615 -> 26.62\n    Hour 15: (3*28.22 + 2*23.14 + 1*22.98)/6 = (84.66 + 46.28 + 22.98)/6 = 153.92/6 = 25.6533 -> 25.65\n    Hour 16: (3*28.03 + 2*23.32 + 1*22.94)/6 = (84.09 + 46.64 + 22.94)/6 = 153.67/6 = 25.6117 -> 25.61\n    Hour 17: (3*34.96 + 2*23.83 + 1*23.42)/6 = (104.88 + 47.66 + 23.42)/6 = 175.96/6 = 29.3267 -> 29.33\n    Hour 18: (3*46.31 + 2*24.67 + 1*23.89)/6 = (138.93 + 49.34 + 23.89)/6 = 212.16/6 = 35.36\n    Hour 19: (3*35.96 + 2*24.48 + 1*23.78)/6 = (107.88 + 48.96 + 23.78)/6 = 180.62/6 = 30.1033 -> 30.10\n    Hour 20: (3*27.89 + 2*23.82 + 1*22.58)/6 = (83.67 + 47.64 + 22.58)/6 = 153.89/6 = 25.6483 -> 25.65\n    Hour 21: (3*25.79 + 2*23.69 + 1*21.99)/6 = (77.37 + 47.38 + 21.99)/6 = 146.74/6 = 24.4567 -> 24.46\n    Hour 22: (3*24.80 + 2*23.46 + 1*21.41)/6 = (74.40 + 46.92 + 21.41)/6 = 142.73/6 = 23.7883 -> 23.79\n    Hour 23: (3*23.96 + 2*23.09 + 1*20.60)/6 = (71.88 + 46.18 + 20.60)/6 = 138.66/6 = 23.11\n\n 20. However, note that the spike on Monday might be an outlier. But we are using two other days to mitigate it. Alternatively, we could use a different weighting (like giving more weight to the same day of the previous week) but we believe the recent day (Monday) is more important.\n\n 21. We output the forecast for 2015/10/20 from 00:00 to 23:00.\n\n 22. Format the answer as required.\n\n Note: This is a simple heuristic. In practice, one would use more sophisticated models and include exogenous variables if available. But the problem does not provide future exogenous variables, so we cannot use them for the forecast.\n\n Let's write the forecast in the required format.\n",
