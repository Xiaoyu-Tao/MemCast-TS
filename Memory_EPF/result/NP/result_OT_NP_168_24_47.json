        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2013/11/26 0:00 to 2013/12/2 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2013/12/3 0:00 to 2013/12/3 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the historical observed prices. Since we don't have the other features, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\nGiven the constraints, we are to forecast the next 24 hours. We note that the data has a clear daily seasonality and also weekly patterns. Since we are at the beginning of December, and we have data from late November, we can use a time series model that captures seasonality.\n\nApproach:\n1. Check for missing values: The provided data does not have any missing values in the given sample. But if there were, we would have to impute (e.g., linear interpolation or using the previous value). Since the problem says \"handle them carefully\", but in this case, we don't have missing values in the provided data.\n\n2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. We can use a model that is suitable for short-term forecasting. Given the hourly data and the clear daily pattern (with 24-hour seasonality), we can use a seasonal naive method, or more sophisticated models like SARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. However, without the additional features (load and wind forecasts) we are limited to univariate methods.\n\n3. Given the context of being an expert, we might use a simple but effective method. The seasonal naive method (using the value from the same hour of the previous day) is a strong baseline for seasonal data. But note that the data also shows a weekly pattern? Let's check: \n   - The data from 2013/11/26 (Tuesday) to 2013/12/2 (Monday). We are forecasting for 2013/12/3 (Tuesday). \n   - We can compare the pattern of the previous Tuesday (2013/11/26) and the most recent days.\n\n4. However, the seasonal naive with a seasonality of 24 hours might not capture the weekly pattern. Alternatively, we can use a 7-day seasonal pattern (168 hours) but that is too long for a naive method and might not capture recent changes.\n\n5. Another idea: use an average of the last few days at the same hour. But without more information, we can try a simple approach: use the same hour from the previous day (i.e., 24-hour lag) and adjust by the trend of the last week? \n\n6. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the same hour over the last week (7 days). But note that the last 7 days include a weekend (Saturday and Sunday) which have different patterns. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2013/11/26) and the most recent Monday (2013/12/2) to adjust? \n\nBut note: the problem does not to use external features, so we must base solely on the historical prices.\n\nGiven the complexity and without a model built, we can use a simple weighted average of the same hour from the last two days and the same day of the previous week? However, the problem requires a forecast and we are an expert, so we must provide a reasonable forecast.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I propose to use a Seasonal Naive model with a seasonality of 24 hours, but using the most recent day (2013/12/2, Monday) as the base, and then adjust by the difference between the same day of the previous week (2013/11/25 is not provided, but we have 2013/11/26 Tuesday) and the Monday of that week (2013/11/25 is missing). \n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? \n\nBut note: the data shows that weekdays have higher prices during the day and lower at night, and weekends are lower. Since 2013/12/3 is a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2013/11/26) and the current week's Monday (2013/12/2) to adjust.\n\nHowever, without a clear model, I will use a simple method: \n- For each hour of the day (0 to 23) on 2013/12/3, we take the average of the same hour on the last two weekdays (Monday 2013/12/2 and the previous Friday 2013/11/29? because the weekend days are different). But note that the last two days are Monday and Sunday, and Sunday is a weekend. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) and the same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2013/11/26) and average them.\n\nBut note: the data from 2013/11/26 (Tuesday) to 2013/12/2 (Monday) is 7 days. So we can take the same hour over the last 7 days and average? But that would include weekend days which are different.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same hour from the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same hour from the previous Tuesday? \n\nBut note: the data we have for weekdays: \n- Tuesday 2013/11/26\n- Wednesday 2013/11/27\n- Thursday 2013/11/28\n- Friday 2013/11/29\n- Monday 2013/12/2 (we skip the weekend: 2013/11/30 and 2013/12/1)\n\nSo for forecasting Tuesday 2013/12/3, we can use:\n- The same hour from the previous Tuesday (2013/11/26)\n- The same hour from the previous Monday (2013/12/2) to capture the most recent day.\n\nBut we don't have a direct same day from the previous week? We have the Tuesday from last week. \n\nSo I will use: \n   forecast = (last_week_same_hour + 2 * yesterday_same_hour) / 3\n\nWhy? Because yesterday is the most recent and might be more relevant, so we give it double weight.\n\nBut note: yesterday was Monday and we are forecasting Tuesday. The pattern of last week Tuesday might be more similar? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays: Monday (2013/12/2, Friday (2013/11/29), and Thursday (2013/11/28) and Tuesday (2013/11/26) and then take an average? \n\nBut without a clear model, I will use a simple average of the same hour from the last two weekdays that are the same day of the week? But we only have one previous Tuesday.\n\nGiven the complexity, I will use a weighted average of the same hour from the previous week Tuesday and the same hour from the day before (Monday). The weights: 0.4 for the previous Tuesday and 0.6 for the Monday (to give more weight to the most recent day).\n\nSo for hour h (0 to 23) on 2013/12/3:\n   forecast_h = 0.4 * (price on 2013/11/26 at hour h) + 0.6 * (price on 2013/12/2 at hour h)\n\nBut note: 2013/11/26 was a Tuesday and 2013/12/2 was a Monday. They are different days of the week. However, we don't have a better reference.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) but Sunday and Saturday are weekends and have different patterns. \n\nGiven that 2013/12/3 is a Tuesday, we should rely more on the previous Tuesday and then adjust by the recent trend. \n\nBut note: the overall level of prices might have changed. We can compute the average price of the last 7 days and the average price of the previous week (from 2013/11/26 to 2013/12/2) and then adjust the previous Tuesday by the ratio? \n\nHowever, to keep it simple, I will use the weighted average as above.\n\nLet me calculate the forecast for the next 24 hours (from 0:00 to 23:00 on 2013/12/3) using:\n   forecast_h = 0.4 * (price on 2013/11/26 at hour h) + 0.6 * (price on 2013/12/2 at hour h)\n\nBut note: the data for 2013/11/26 and 2013/12/2 are both are weekdays, but one is Monday and one is Tuesday. We are forecasting a Tuesday, so we hope that the pattern of Tuesday last week is similar, but adjusted by the recent level of Monday.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday and then adjust by the change from last Monday to this Monday? \n\nBut we don't have last Monday (2013/11/25) because the data starts on 2013/11/26.\n\nSo we stick to the weighted average.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nFor hour 0:00 (the first hour of 2013/12/3):\n   last Tuesday (2013/11/26 0:00): 34.53\n   yesterday (2013/12/2 0:00): 33.64\n   forecast = 0.4*34.53 + 0.6*33.64 = 13.812 + 20.184 = 33.996\n\nSimilarly, we do for all 24 hours.\n\nBut note: the problem says to handle missing values, but we don't have any in the provided data.\n\nWe will generate 24 values.\n\nHowever, note that the data provided ends at 2013/12/2 23:00, so the next 24 hours are 2013/12/3 0:00 to 2013/12/3 23:00.\n\nWe'll generate the forecast accordingly.\n\nBut wait, is this method accurate? We are an expert, so we should use a more robust method? However, without the additional features and without a pre-built model, we have to rely on a simple method.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a moving average model with seasonality. But for the sake of this task, we use the above.\n\nLet me write the forecast for the next 24 hours:\n\nWe'll create a list of the previous Tuesday (2013/11/26) and the previous day (2013/12/2) for the same hours.\n\nPrevious Tuesday (2013/11/26) 24 hours:\n[34.53, 34.31, 34.10, 34.30, 35.23, 36.89, 43.19, 46.97, 51.71, 48.90, 46.00, 45.54, 44.04, 44.84, 45.83, 46.86, 48.48, 48.04, 43.55, 40.41, 38.73, 37.75, 36.37, 33.83]\n\nPrevious day (2013/12/2) 24 hours:\n[33.64, 33.43, 33.44, 33.60, 34.15, 36.27, 43.44, 50.11, 59.96, 50.00, 46.85, 46.08, 45.79, 46.10, 45.06, 46.98, 48.20, 46.96, 43.70, 40.30, 38.67, 36.85, 35.60, 33.62]\n\nThen for each hour index h (0 to 23):\n   forecast_h = 0.4 * (prev_tuesday[h]) + 0.6 * (prev_day[h])\n\nLet's compute:\n\nh0: 0.4*34.53 + 0.6*33.64 = 13.812 + 20.184 = 33.996 -> 34.00 (rounded to two decimals as in the data)\nh1: 0.4*34.31 + 0.6*33.43 = 13.724 + 20.058 = 33.782 -> 33.78\nh2: 0.4*34.10 + 0.6*33.44 = 13.64 + 20.064 = 33.704 -> 33.70\nh3: 0.4*34.30 + 0.6*33.60 = 13.72 + 20.16 = 33.88 -> 33.88\nh4: 0.4*35.23 + 0.6*34.15 = 14.092 + 20.49 = 34.582 -> 34.58\nh5: 0.4*36.89 + 0.6*36.27 = 14.756 + 21.762 = 36.518 -> 36.52\nh6: 0.4*43.19 + 0.6*43.44 = 17.276 + 26.064 = 43.34 -> 43.34\nh7: 0.4*46.97 + 0.6*50.11 = 18.788 + 30.066 = 48.854 -> 48.85\nh8: 0.4*51.71 + 0.6*59.96 = 20.684 + 35.976 = 56.66 -> 56.66\nh9: 0.4*48.90 + 0.6*50.00 = 19.56 + 30.00 = 49.56 -> 49.56\nh10: 0.4*46.00 + 0.6*46.85 = 18.4 + 28.11 = 46.51 -> 46.51\nh11: 0.4*45.54 + 0.6*46.08 = 18.216 + 27.648 = 45.864 -> 45.86\nh12: 0.4*44.04 + 0.6*45.79 = 17.616 + 27.474 = 45.09 -> 45.09\nh13: 0.4*44.84 + 0.6*46.10 = 17.936 + 27.66 = 45.596 -> 45.60\nh14: 0.4*45.83 + 0.6*45.06 = 18.332 + 27.036 = 45.368 -> 45.37\nh15: 0.4*46.86 + 0.6*46.98 = 18.744 + 28.188 = 46.932 -> 46.93\nh16: 0.4*48.48 + 0.6*48.20 = 19.392 + 28.92 = 48.312 -> 48.31\nh17: 0.4*48.04 + 0.6*46.96 = 19.216 + 28.176 = 47.392 -> 47.39\nh18: 0.4*43.55 + 0.6*43.70 = 17.42 + 26.22 = 43.64 -> 43.64\nh19: 0.4*40.41 + 0.6*40.30 = 16.164 + 24.18 = 40.344 -> 40.34\nh20: 0.4*38.73 + 0.6*38.67 = 15.492 + 23.202 = 38.694 -> 38.69\nh21: 0.4*37.75 + 0.6*36.85 = 15.1 + 22.11 = 37.21 -> 37.21\nh22: 0.4*36.37 + 0.6*35.60 = 14.548 + 21.36 = 35.908 -> 35.91\nh23: 0.4*33.83 + 0.6*33.62 = 13.532 + 20.172 = 33.704 -> 33.70\n\nSo the forecast for 2013/12/3 from 0:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n2013/12/3 0:00: 34.00\n2013/12/3 1:00: 33.78\n2013/12/3 2:00: 33.70\n2013/12/3 3:00: 33.88\n2013/12/3 4:00: 34.58\n2013/12/3 5:00: 36.52\n2013/12/3 6:00: 43.34\n2013/12/3 7:00: 48.85\n2013/12/3 8:00: 56.66\n2013/12/3 9:00: 49.56\n2013/12/3 10:00: 46.51\n2013/12/3 11:00: 45.86\n2013/12/3 12:00: 45.09\n2013/12/3 13:00: 45.60\n2013/12/3 14:00: 45.37\n2013/12/3 15:00: 46.93\n2013/12/3 16:00: 48.31\n2013/12/3 17:00: 47.39\n2013/12/3 18:00: 43.64\n2013/12/3 19:00: 40.34\n2013/12/3 20:00: 38.69\n2013/12/3 21:00: 37.21\n2013/12/3 22:00: 35.91\n2013/12/3 23:00: 33.70\n\nBut note: the problem requires the format to be exactly as the input, with the date and the value.\n\nWe must output the next 24 hours in the same format.\n\nSo we write:\n\n  2013/12/3 0:00 <value>\n  2013/12/3 1:00 <value>\n  ... \n\nWe'll write the forecasted values with two decimal places as in the input.\n\nHowever, note that the input uses a space between the date and the time, and the time is written as \"0:00\" (without leading zero for hour). We'll write the date as \"2013/12/3\" (without leading zero for day).\n\nBut note: the input uses a space after the date and then the time without a space? Actually, the input has a space and then the time. And the time is written as \"0:00\", \"1:00\", etc.\n\nSo we output:\n\n<answer>\n\n 2013/12/3 0:00 34.00\n 2013/12/3 1:00 33.78\n 2013/12/3 2:00 33.70\n 2013/12/3 3:00 33.88\n 2013/12/3 4:00 34.58\n 2013/12/3 5:00 36.52\n 2013/12/3 6:00 43.34\n 2013/12/3 7:00 48.85\n 2013/12/3 8:00 56.66\n 2013/12/3 9:00 49.56\n2013/12/3 10:00 46.51\n2013/12/3 11:00 45.86\n2013/12/3 12:00 45.09\n2013/12/3 13:00 45.60\n2013/12/3 14:00 45.37\n2013/12/3 15:00 46.93\n2013/12/3 16:00 48.31\n2013/12/3 17:00 47.39\n2013/12/3 18:00 43.64\n2013/12/3 19:00 40.34\n2013/12/3 20:00 38.69\n2013/12/3 21:00 37.21\n2013/12/3 22:00 35.91\n2013/12/3 23:00 33.70\n\n</answer>\n\nBut note: the input uses a space for the hour 0:00 to 9:00 with a single space after the date? Actually, the input has a single space for the hour 0:00 to 9:00 and then for 10:00 and above, the date has one less space? \n\nLooking at the input:\n\n 2013/11/26 0:00 -> there is a space before the single-digit hour? Actually, the formatting is inconsistent: \n   \" 2013/11/26 0:00\" has a space at the beginning? \n\nBut in the input, the dates are aligned with a space for the day part? \n\nWe can output without the leading space and just:\n\n2013/12/3 0:00\n2013/12/3 1:00\n...\n2013/12/3 9:00\n2013/12/3 10:00\n\nSo we output without the leading space.\n\nBut the input has a space for the first 10 rows? Actually, the input has:\n\n            date    OT\n 2013/11/26 0:00 34.53\n 2013/11/26 1:00 34.31\n\nSo the date string is aligned to the right? But we don't need to align. We can output without the leading space.\n\nAlternatively, we can output with the same format: for the day part, we have 10 characters? The date string is \"2013/12/3\" which is 9 characters, and then a space and then the time (which is 4 characters for 0:00 to 9:00, and 5 characters for 10:00 to 23:00). \n\nBut the input, the first 10 rows (with hour 0:00 to 9:00) have the date string with a leading space? Actually, the input has:\n\n 2013/11/26 0:00 -> 10 characters for the date part? Actually, the string \"2013/11/26\" is 10 characters? No: \n   \"2013/11/26\" is 9 characters? \n   Then a space and then \"0:00\" -> total 13 characters? \n\nBut the input has a leading space? The first row: \" 2013/11/26 0:00\" -> the first character is a space.\n\nTo be consistent, we can output without the leading space. The problem does not specify the exact formatting of the date string, only the content.\n\nSo we output:\n\n2013/12/3 0:00 34.00\n2013/12/3 1:00 33.78\n...\n\nBut note: the day is written as \"3\" for December 3, which is correct.\n\nWe'll output 24 lines.\n\nFinal answer:\n",
