        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity prices (from 2013/5/21 0:00 to 2013/5/27 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2013/5/28 0:00 to 2013/5/28 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values to handle.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power) in the provided data. Therefore, we must rely on a time series model that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are forecasting short-term electricity prices, which typically exhibit daily and weekly seasonality, we can use a model that captures these patterns.\n\n However, note that the data provided is only for 7 days (one week). We can observe:\n   - Daily pattern: Prices are usually lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Weekly pattern: We have one full week (from Tuesday to Monday). But note that 2013/5/27 is a Monday, and we are forecasting the next day (Tuesday, 2013/5/28). \n\n Given the limited data, we can use a simple method such as:\n   - Using the average of the same hour of the previous days (e.g., average of the 0:00 hour from the past 7 days to forecast the next 0:00) to capture the daily seasonality.\n\n But note: The week includes a weekend (25th and 26th, Saturday and Sunday) and the 27th is a Monday. The next day (28th) is a Tuesday. So we might want to use the same weekday from the previous week? However, we only have one Tuesday in the data (21st) and then the next Tuesday is the 28th.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day (i.e., the Tuesday of the previous week) as a base and adjust with the recent trend? But we don't have multiple weeks.\n\n Another approach: Use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal naive method: using the same hour from the previous day? But the previous day (Monday) might be different from Tuesday.\n\n Considering the data, we have:\n   - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2013/5/21) and then the next days until Monday. We are forecasting for Tuesday (2013/5/28).\n\n Since we have only one week of data, we can use the following:\n   - For each hour h (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2013/5/28), we take the average of the same hour h from the last 7 days (i.e., 2013/5/21 to 2013/5/27). This will capture the daily pattern and smooth out the weekly variations.\n\n However, note that weekends (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns. We are forecasting a Tuesday, so we might want to use only the previous Tuesday? But we only have one Tuesday (2013/5/21). Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the same day of the week in the previous week (i.e., the Tuesday of the previous week) and then adjust by the overall trend of the last week? But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we have only 7 days, we can do:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on 2013/5/28 = average of the same hour h for the past 7 days.\n\n But let's check the data: \n   For example, the 0:00 hour for the past 7 days:\n        2013/5/21 0:00: 31.89\n        2013/5/22 0:00: 31.76\n        2013/5/23 0:00: 27.33\n        2013/5/24 0:00: 36.20\n        2013/5/25 0:00: 36.17\n        2013/5/26 0:00: 31.09\n        2013/5/27 0:00: 33.11\n\n   Average = (31.89 + 31.76 + 27.33 + 36.20 + 36.17 + 31.09 + 33.11) / 7 = 32.507\n\n   However, note that the last day (Monday) was 33.11, and the previous Tuesday was 31.89. The average might be a reasonable estimate.\n\n But we can also consider that the price on the same day of the previous week (Tuesday) was 31.89, and the overall week has been fluctuating. Without more data, the average is a safe method.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? For example, exponential smoothing.\n\n However, the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values (which we don't have) and provide the forecast.\n\n Considering the above, I will use the simple average of the same hour over the past 7 days for each hour.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23) of the forecast day (2013/5/28):\n   Let h be the hour (0 to 23).\n   Let values = [ price at hour h on 2013/5/21, 2013/5/22, 2013/5/23, 2013/5/24, 2013/5/25, 2013/5/26, 2013/5/27 ]\n   forecast_h = average(values)\n\n But note: the data for 2013/5/21 is the same day of the week (Tuesday) as the forecast day (2013/5/28). The rest are different. We might consider using only the same day of the week? But we have only one Tuesday. So we can use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days as a baseline.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the same day of the week for the past weeks? But we only have one week.\n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days.\n\n However, let me check the pattern: \n   Monday (2013/5/27) at 0:00: 33.11\n   Sunday (2013/5/26) at 0:00: 31.09\n   Saturday (2013/5/25) at 0:00: 36.17\n   Friday (2013/5/24) at 0:00: 36.20\n   Thursday (2013/5/23) at 0:00: 27.33\n   Wednesday (2013/5/22) at 0:00: 31.76\n   Tuesday (2013/5/21) at 0:00: 31.89\n\n The average is 32.507 as above.\n\n But note: the price on Thursday (27.33) is an outlier? It is lower. We are including it. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the median? It might be more robust. However, the problem does not specify the method. Since we are an expert, we can choose a method that is typical for electricity prices.\n\n In practice, short-term forecasting often uses more sophisticated models (like ARIMA, exponential smoothing with seasonality, or machine learning). But with only 7 days and without the exogenous variables, we have to keep it simple.\n\n I decide to use the average for each hour.\n\n Let's compute for each hour from 0 to 23:\n\n   For hour 0: \n        (31.89 + 31.76 + 27.33 + 36.20 + 36.17 + 31.09 + 33.11) / 7 = 32.507 -> 32.51\n\n   For hour 1:\n        (27.92 + 29.09 + 25.06 + 33.22 + 34.02 + 28.42 + 32.06) / 7 = 28.827 -> 28.83\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n However, note that the data for the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) might have different patterns. But we are including them. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we might get a blend of patterns.\n\n Alternatively, we can use only the weekdays? But the forecast day is a weekday (Tuesday). We have two weekend days and five weekdays. We could use only the weekdays? Then we would have 5 days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday.\n\n But note: Monday is the day before the forecast, and Tuesday (previous week) is the same day. However, we have only one Tuesday. So we can do:\n\n   For each hour, take the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the past week? But the past weekdays are: \n        Tuesday (21st), Wednesday (22nd), Thursday (23rd), Friday (24th), Monday (27th) -> 5 days.\n\n   Then for hour 0: (31.89 + 31.76 + 27.33 + 36.20 + 33.11) / 5 = 32.058\n\n   For hour 1: (27.92 + 29.09 + 25.06 + 33.22 + 32.06) / 5 = 29.47\n\n   This might be more representative for a weekday.\n\n But note: the Monday (27th) is a holiday? We don't know. But in general, weekdays have similar patterns and weekends are different. Since we are forecasting a weekday, we can use only the weekdays.\n\n However, the problem does not specify holidays. We assume the data is for regular days.\n\n I think using only the weekdays (excluding Saturday and Sunday) for the same hour is better.\n\n Steps for each hour h in [0,23]:\n   Collect the prices for hour h on the weekdays in the historical data (which are 2013/5/21, 2013/5/22, 2013/5/23, 2013/5/24, 2013/5/27) -> 5 days.\n   Compute the average.\n\n But note: 2013/5/25 and 2013/5/26 are Saturday and Sunday, so we skip them.\n\n Let me do the calculation for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: [31.89, 31.76, 27.33, 36.20, 33.11] -> average = (31.89+31.76+27.33+36.20+33.11)/5 = 160.29/5 = 32.058\n   Hour 1: [27.92, 29.09, 25.06, 33.22, 32.06] -> 147.35/5 = 29.47\n   Hour 2: [22.26, 24.78, 21.18, 31.01, 30.92] -> 130.15/5 = 26.03\n   Hour 3: [22.38, 20.07, 21.53, 29.89, 30.23] -> 124.1/5 = 24.82\n   Hour 4: [25.11, 20.25, 28.00, 30.08, 32.02] -> 135.46/5 = 27.092\n   Hour 5: [30.82, 28.94, 31.30, 33.93, 34.53] -> 159.52/5 = 31.904\n   Hour 6: [39.50, 35.71, 37.09, 38.88, 38.32] -> 189.5/5 = 37.90\n   Hour 7: [43.48, 40.21, 42.00, 40.98, 43.77] -> 210.44/5 = 42.088\n   Hour 8: [46.18, 41.99, 45.03, 42.34, 47.17] -> 222.71/5 = 44.542\n   Hour 9: [44.59, 41.57, 45.18, 42.45, 48.57] -> 222.36/5 = 44.472\n   Hour 10: [43.04, 41.35, 44.72, 43.22, 46.99] -> 219.32/5 = 43.864\n   Hour 11: [44.66, 40.98, 44.55, 42.36, 45.94] -> 218.49/5 = 43.698\n   Hour 12: [42.89, 39.16, 44.00, 41.75, 44.41] -> 212.21/5 = 42.442\n   Hour 13: [42.68, 38.37, 43.25, 40.96, 45.04] -> 210.3/5 = 42.06\n   Hour 14: [41.87, 36.95, 43.59, 40.87, 44.57] -> 207.85/5 = 41.57\n   Hour 15: [41.16, 35.44, 43.44, 39.70, 43.95] -> 203.69/5 = 40.738\n   Hour 16: [40.58, 33.47, 42.90, 39.33, 43.70] -> 199.98/5 = 39.996\n   Hour 17: [40.98, 33.09, 42.15, 39.15, 43.43] -> 198.8/5 = 39.76\n   Hour 18: [40.49, 32.84, 42.95, 39.09, 44.01] -> 199.38/5 = 39.876\n   Hour 19: [39.51, 33.09, 42.09, 39.98, 43.18] -> 197.85/5 = 39.57\n   Hour 20: [38.36, 33.71, 41.07, 39.48, 42.42] -> 195.04/5 = 39.008\n   Hour 21: [38.03, 33.92, 40.86, 39.10, 42.64] -> 194.55/5 = 38.91\n   Hour 22: [36.75, 32.72, 39.97, 38.61, 41.16] -> 189.21/5 = 37.842\n   Hour 23: [34.51, 28.72, 37.45, 36.27, 38.33] -> 175.28/5 = 35.056\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2013/5/28:\n\n   0:00: 32.06\n   1:00: 29.47\n   2:00: 26.03\n   3:00: 24.82\n   4:00: 27.09\n   5:00: 31.90\n   6:00: 37.90\n   7:00: 42.09\n   8:00: 44.54\n   9:00: 44.47\n   10:00: 43.86\n   11:00: 43.70\n   12:00: 42.44\n   13:00: 42.06\n   14:00: 41.57\n   15:00: 40.74\n   16:00: 40.00\n   17:00: 39.76\n   18:00: 39.88\n   19:00: 39.57\n   20:00: 39.01\n   21:00: 38.91\n   22:00: 37.84\n   23:00: 35.06\n\n But note: the above averages are computed with two decimal places. We round to two decimals as in the input.\n\n However, the input data has two decimal places. We'll keep two decimals.\n\n But note: the average for hour 4: 27.092 -> 27.09? or 27.10? We'll round to two decimals.\n\n Let me recast the averages to two decimal places:\n\n   Hour0: 32.058 -> 32.06\n   Hour1: 29.47 -> 29.47\n   Hour2: 26.03 -> 26.03\n   Hour3: 24.82 -> 24.82\n   Hour4: 27.092 -> 27.09\n   Hour5: 31.904 -> 31.90\n   Hour6: 37.90 -> 37.90\n   Hour7: 42.088 -> 42.09\n   Hour8: 44.542 -> 44.54\n   Hour9: 44.472 -> 44.47\n   Hour10: 43.864 -> 43.86\n   Hour11: 43.698 -> 43.70\n   Hour12: 42.442 -> 42.44\n   Hour13: 42.06 -> 42.06\n   Hour14: 41.57 -> 41.57\n   Hour15: 40.738 -> 40.74\n   Hour16: 39.996 -> 40.00 (since 39.996 rounded to two decimals is 40.00)\n   Hour17: 39.76 -> 39.76\n   Hour18: 39.876 -> 39.88\n   Hour19: 39.57 -> 39.57\n   Hour20: 39.008 -> 39.01\n   Hour21: 38.91 -> 38.91\n   Hour22: 37.842 -> 37.84\n   Hour23: 35.056 -> 35.06\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2013/5/28:\n\n   0:00: 32.06\n   1:00: 29.47\n   2:00: 26.03\n   3:00: 24.82\n   4:00: 27.09\n   5:00: 31.90\n   6:00: 37.90\n   7:00: 42.09\n   8:00: 44.54\n   9:00: 44.47\n   10:00: 43.86\n   11:00: 43.70\n   12:00: 42.44\n   13:00: 42.06\n   14:00: 41.57\n   15:00: 40.74\n   16:00: 40.00\n   17:00: 39.76\n   18:00: 39.88\n   19:00: 39.57\n   20:00: 39.01\n   21:00: 38.91\n   22:00: 37.84\n   23:00: 35.06\n\n We output the forecast in the required format.\n\n Note: The date for the forecast is 2013/5/28, starting at 0:00 and ending at 23:00.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2013/5/28 0:00 32.06\n        2013/5/28 1:00 29.47\n        ... \n        2013/5/28 23:00 35.06\n    </answer>\n",
