        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/5/6 0:00 to 2014/5/12 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/5/13 0:00 to 2014/5/13 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the observed price (OT) as a time series, we must rely on time series forecasting methods. Given the data, we can observe a daily seasonality (24-hour cycle) and also weekly patterns (though we have only one week of data). However, the problem does not provide any exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, so we must use a univariate time series model.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) so there are no missing hours. The data seems complete.\n\n 2. We note that the data has:\n    - A clear daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day, with peaks in the morning and evening.\n    - The weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher peaks than the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).\n\n 3. Since we are forecasting only 24 hours ahead, we can use a model that captures seasonality. Given the daily seasonality (period=24), we can use a seasonal naive method, or more advanced models like SARIMA or exponential smoothing. However, without the ability to run complex model fitting here, we can use a simple but effective approach.\n\n 4. Considering the day of the week: The next day is Tuesday (since 2014/5/12 is a Monday, then 2014/5/13 is Tuesday). We can look at the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, which is 2014/5/6) and adjust for any recent trend.\n\n 5. But note: the data from 2014/5/6 (Tuesday) to 2014/5/12 (Monday) is provided. The next day is 2014/5/13 (Tuesday). We can use the previous Tuesday (2014/5/6) as a base and then adjust by the average change between consecutive days.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use an average of the last few days at the same hour, but giving more weight to the most recent days and the same day of the previous week.\n\n 7. Proposed method: \n    - We will compute the average of the same hour of the last two days (Monday and Sunday) and the same hour of the previous week (Tuesday). \n    - We can also consider the trend from the last 24 hours.\n\n 8. However, note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) has lower prices. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we should rely more on the previous Tuesday and the Monday (which is a weekday) and the Monday (2014/5/12) we have.\n\n 9. We can use a weighted average:\n    - Weight for the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2014/5/6): 0.5\n    - Weight for the same hour of the day before (Monday, 2014/5/12): 0.3\n    - Weight for the same hour two days before (Sunday, 2014/5/11): 0.2\n\n 10. But note: the data for 2014/5/11 (Sunday) and 2014/5/12 (Monday) are available. The next day is 2014/5/13 (Tuesday).\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour from the last three weekdays? However, we have only one previous Tuesday and the last two days (Monday and Sunday) are not both weekdays. So we adjust by using:\n     - Previous Tuesday (2014/5/6) as the main reference for the Tuesday pattern.\n     - The most recent day (Monday 2014/5/12) to capture the recent level.\n     - The Sunday (2014/5/11) might be less relevant for a Tuesday, but we can use it to capture the trend.\n\n 12. Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last three days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the average of the same three days relative to that Tuesday? This might be too complex.\n\n 13. Given the simplicity required, we can do:\n\n     Forecast for hour h (0 to 23) on 2014/5/13 = \n        0.5 * (value at hour h on 2014/5/6) \n        + 0.3 * (value at hour h on 2014/5/12) \n        + 0.2 * (value at hour h on 2014/5/11)\n\n 14. Why these weights? \n     - 0.5 for the same day of the week (Tuesday) because it is the same weekday and likely to have a similar pattern.\n     - 0.3 for the most recent day (Monday) to capture the current level.\n     - 0.2 for the day before (Sunday) to capture the trend from the weekend to the weekday.\n\n 15. However, note that the transition from weekend to weekday might be better captured by the Monday data. Also, the previous Tuesday (2014/5/6) is a week ago and the market conditions might have changed.\n\n 16. Alternatively, we can use a moving average of the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for the same hour and then adjust by the ratio of the previous Tuesday to the average of the same 3 days (Saturday, Friday, Thursday) of the previous week? This is getting complex.\n\n 17. Given the constraints, I will use the weighted average as in step 13.\n\n 18. But note: the data for 2014/5/11 (Sunday) and 2014/5/12 (Monday) are available, and 2014/5/6 (Tuesday) is available.\n\n 19. Let's calculate for one hour to see: \n     For hour 0:00:\n        2014/5/6 0:00: 25.17\n        2014/5/12 0:00: 25.05 (Monday)\n        2014/5/11 0:00: 25.10 (Sunday)\n\n        Forecast = 0.5*25.17 + 0.3*25.05 + 0.2*25.10 = 12.585 + 7.515 + 5.02 = 25.12\n\n 20. We can do a simple adjustment: if we observe a trend over the last 24 hours (from 2014/5/12 0:00 to 2014/5/12 23:00) we could add a trend component? But the problem is univariate and we are only given 168 hours.\n\n 21. Given the time, we will use the weighted average for each hour.\n\n 22. However, note that the data for 2014/5/12 (Monday) is a weekday and the previous Tuesday (2014/5/6) is also a weekday, but Sunday is a weekend. The Tuesday we are forecasting is a weekday, so we might want to reduce the weight of Sunday? Let's change the weights:\n\n     Weights: \n        Previous Tuesday (2014/5/6): 0.6\n        Monday (2014/5/12): 0.4\n\n     and drop Sunday? Because Sunday is a weekend and Tuesday is a weekday.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two weekdays (Monday and the previous Tuesday) and then adjust by the most recent day (Monday) being the most recent. But we have only one Monday and one Tuesday.\n\n 24. We can also to consider the average of the same hour of the last two weekdays that are the same day of the week? We have only one previous Tuesday.\n\n 25. Given the data, I will use:\n        Forecast = 0.6 * (same hour last Tuesday) + 0.4 * (same hour last Monday)\n\n 26. Let's recalc hour 0:00: \n        0.6 * 25.17 + 0.4 * 25.05 = 15.102 + 10.02 = 25.122\n\n 27. We can also consider the overall trend: from the last 7 days, the prices on 2014/5/12 (Monday) are generally higher than on 2014/5/6 (Tuesday). We can adjust by the average level change.\n\n 28. But for simplicity, we'll stick with the weighted average.\n\n 29. We'll take:\n        For hour h in [0,23]:\n            forecast_h = 0.6 * (price at hour h on 2014/5/6) + 0.4 * (price at hour h on 2014/5/12)\n\n 30. However, note that 2014/5/6 was a Tuesday and 2014/5/12 was a Monday. The pattern might be different. But we are using the same hour, and we are giving more weight to the same day of the week (Tuesday) and then the Monday to adjust for the current level.\n\n 31. Let's do a test for a peak hour, say 8:00:\n        2014/5/6 8:00: 33.95\n        2014/5/12 8:00: 39.99\n        Forecast = 0.6*33.95 + 0.4*39.99 = 20.37 + 15.996 = 36.366\n\n 32. This seems reasonable because the Monday was higher, but we are forecasting a Tuesday which might be similar to the previous Tuesday but with an upward trend.\n\n 33. We'll generate the 24 hours accordingly.\n\n 34. The next 24 hours are from 2014/5/13 0:00 to 2014/5/13 23:00.\n\n 35. We'll compute:\n\n        hour0 (0:00): 0.6 * 25.17 (from 5/6) + 0.4 * 25.05 (from 5/12) = 15.102 + 10.02 = 25.122 -> 25.12\n        hour1 (1:00): 0.6 * 24.42 + 0.4 * 24.93 = 14.652 + 9.972 = 24.624 -> 24.62\n        hour2 (2:00): 0.6 * 24.22 + 0.4 * 24.80 = 14.532 + 9.92 = 24.452 -> 24.45\n        hour3 (3:00): 0.6 * 24.10 + 0.4 * 24.84 = 14.46 + 9.936 = 24.396 -> 24.40\n        hour4 (4:00): 0.6 * 24.26 + 0.4 * 25.28 = 14.556 + 10.112 = 24.668 -> 24.67\n        hour5 (5:00): 0.6 * 25.94 + 0.4 * 26.96 = 15.564 + 10.784 = 26.348 -> 26.35\n        hour6 (6:00): 0.6 * 29.53 + 0.4 * 33.17 = 17.718 + 13.268 = 30.986 -> 30.99\n        hour7 (7:00): 0.6 * 33.30 + 0.4 * 38.34 = 19.98 + 15.336 = 35.316 -> 35.32\n        hour8 (8:00): 0.6 * 33.95 + 0.4 * 39.99 = 20.37 + 15.996 = 36.366 -> 36.37\n        hour9 (9:00): 0.6 * 32.67 + 0.4 * 40.13 = 19.602 + 16.052 = 35.654 -> 35.65\n        hour10 (10:00): 0.6 * 31.39 + 0.4 * 39.97 = 18.834 + 15.988 = 34.822 -> 34.82\n        hour11 (11:00): 0.6 * 31.05 + 0.4 * 38.30 = 18.63 + 15.32 = 33.95 -> 33.95\n        hour12 (12:00): 0.6 * 30.16 + 0.4 * 36.98 = 18.096 + 14.792 = 32.888 -> 32.89\n        hour13 (13:00): 0.6 * 29.80 + 0.4 * 35.87 = 17.88 + 14.348 = 32.228 -> 32.23\n        hour14 (14:00): 0.6 * 29.25 + 0.4 * 33.88 = 17.55 + 13.552 = 31.102 -> 31.10\n        hour15 (15:00): 0.6 * 29.12 + 0.4 * 33.38 = 17.472 + 13.352 = 30.824 -> 30.82\n        hour16 (16:00): 0.6 * 29.07 + 0.4 * 32.52 = 17.442 + 13.008 = 30.45 -> 30.45\n        hour17 (17:00): 0.6 * 29.98 + 0.4 * 33.24 = 17.988 + 13.296 = 31.284 -> 31.28\n        hour18 (18:00): 0.6 * 30.56 + 0.4 * 33.12 = 18.336 + 13.248 = 31.584 -> 31.58\n        hour19 (19:00): 0.6 * 30.58 + 0.4 * 32.86 = 18.348 + 13.144 = 31.492 -> 31.49\n        hour20 (20:00): 0.6 * 30.10 + 0.4 * 33.08 = 18.06 + 13.232 = 31.292 -> 31.29\n        hour21 (21:00): 0.6 * 30.18 + 0.4 * 33.80 = 18.108 + 13.52 = 31.628 -> 31.63\n        hour22 (22:00): 0.6 * 29.17 + 0.4 * 33.04 = 17.502 + 13.216 = 30.718 -> 30.72\n        hour23 (23:00): 0.6 * 26.99 + 0.4 * 30.42 = 16.194 + 12.168 = 28.362 -> 28.36\n\n 36. We are rounding to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n 37. However, note that the previous Tuesday (2014/5/6) had a lower overall level than the Monday (2014/5/12). This method produces a forecast that is a blend.\n\n 38. We output the forecast for 2014/5/13 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 39.
