        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2015-10-06 00:00 to 2015-10-12 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-10-13 00:00 to 2015-10-13 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are missing values, we note that the provided data does not have any missing values in the given period. Therefore, we can proceed without imputation for the historical data.\n\n However, we are only given the 'OT' (observed electricity price) and not the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts. The problem says the dataset contains those, but we are only provided with the price. Therefore, we must base our forecast solely on the historical price data.\n\n Approach:\n We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the data, we can use a time series forecasting method. Since we are an expert, we can use a model that captures daily seasonality (24-hour period) and possibly weekly patterns (though we only have one week of data). However, with only 168 points, we can use a simple model.\n\n Given the constraints, we cannot use complex models that require more data or external variables. We can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day (or same day of the previous week? but we only have one week). However, the data shows a weekly pattern? Let's check the days: \n        The data starts on Tuesday (2015-10-06) and ends on Monday (2015-10-12). \n        We are to forecast Tuesday (2015-10-13).\n\n Since we have exactly one week of data, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., the first day in the data: 2015-10-06) as a naive forecast for 2015-10-13? But note: the pattern might change.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days? But we only have 7 days.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the prices on weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) are higher than on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). The day we are forecasting (2015-10-13) is a Tuesday. The last Tuesday (2015-10-06) is the first day in our data.\n\n But note: the data from 2015-10-06 (Tuesday) to 2015-10-12 (Monday) is 7 days. We can compute the average for each hour of the day over the available days? However, we have only one Tuesday, one Wednesday, etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without more data, a simple method is to use the same day of the previous week (i.e., the first day) as the forecast. However, that might not capture the recent trend.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? But we have 7 days, we can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, we can use a model that captures the daily seasonality and the recent trend.\n\n We can use a method like:\n   - Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing) with daily seasonality (seasonal period=24) and additive or multiplicative seasonality.\n\n However, we are not given any code environment to run a model. We are to provide the forecast as an expert.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple approach: \n   - The last day (2015-10-12, Monday) had a pattern that is similar to a weekday? But the next day is Tuesday. We can take the average of the same hour on the previous weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and the Monday? But note that Monday was a holiday? We don't have that information.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to act as an expert, we choose a method that is simple and commonly used for short-term forecasting: the Seasonal Naive method, but using the same day of the previous week (i.e., the first day in the data, 2015-10-06, which is a Tuesday) for the next Tuesday (2015-10-13). \n\n However, let's compare the last Monday (2015-10-12) and the previous Monday (we don't have, because we start on Tuesday). So we don't have two Mondays.\n\n Therefore, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include the weekend which is lower. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday) and skip the weekend? But we have only one of each.\n\n Given the data, we can do:\n\n   For each hour h (0 to 23) of the day, we take the average of the same hour h from the last 3 weekdays? But we have 5 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). \n\n   We note that the day we are forecasting (Tuesday) is a weekday. So we can average the same hour from the previous weekdays in the data: \n        Tuesday (2015-10-06), Wednesday (2015-10-07), Thursday (2015-10-08), Friday (2015-10-09), and Monday (2015-10-12). \n\n   We have 5 weekdays. So for hour 0: \n        (12.32 + 11.33 + 15.26 + 18.93 + 20.21) / 5 = 15.61\n   But wait, the last Monday (2015-10-12) at hour0 is 20.21, which is higher than the previous Tuesday. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? \n\n   However, the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n   But note: the data shows an increasing trend? Let's see the week:\n\n        Tuesday (2015-10-06): min 10.16, max 16.72\n        Wednesday: min 11.28, max 18.37\n        Thursday: min 15.13, max 22.58\n        Friday: min 18.63, max 25.50\n        Saturday: min 19.65, max 22.11\n        Sunday: min 18.94, max 22.60\n        Monday: min 19.47, max 27.78\n\n   There is an increasing trend until Friday, then a drop on the weekend, and then a peak on Monday.\n\n   Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was the lowest of the weekdays, but the Monday was the highest, we might expect the Tuesday to be somewhere in between? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days? \n\n   We can use an exponential smoothing for the same hour over the weekdays, but we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\n   Given the complexity, and the fact that we are to provide a forecast, we decide to use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Friday, Monday) and the previous Tuesday? But that would be 3 days? \n\n   However, we have 5 weekdays. We can use the average of the same hour for the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n   Therefore, we use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (which includes Saturday, Sunday, and Monday) for the next day? But the next day is Tuesday, which is a weekday, and the last 3 days are weekend and Monday. That might not be representative.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 4 weekdays? (from Wednesday to Friday and Monday) but skip the weekend? \n\n   We decide to use the average of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday) for the next Tuesday. \n\n   But note: the Monday is the day before the forecast day, so it might be more relevant. We can do a weighted average: more weight to the recent days.\n\n   Weights: \n        Monday (2015-10-12): weight 5\n        Friday (2015-10-09): weight 4\n        Thursday (2015-10-08): weight 3\n        Wednesday (2015-10-07): weight 2\n        Tuesday (2015-10-06): weight 1\n\n   Then for hour h: \n        forecast = (w1 * value_tuesday + w2 * value_wednesday + w3 * value_thursday + w4 * value_friday + w5 * value_monday) / (w1+w2+w3+w4+w5)\n\n   where w1=1, w2=2, w3=3, w4=4, w5=5.\n\n   Total weight = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.\n\n   Example for hour0:\n        tue: 12.32 * 1 = 12.32\n        wed: 11.33 * 2 = 22.66\n        thu: 15.26 * 3 = 45.78\n        fri: 18.93 * 4 = 75.72\n        mon: 20.21 * 5 = 101.05\n        total = 12.32+22.66+45.78+75.72+101.05 = 257.53\n        average = 257.53 / 15 = 17.168666... -> 17.17\n\n   But note: the Monday value is the most recent and highest, so it pulls the average up.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the median? The median of the 5 values for hour0: [12.32, 11.33, 15.26, 18.93, 20.21] -> sorted: [11.33, 12.32, 15.26, 18.93, 20.21] -> median=15.26.\n\n   The median might be less sensitive to the recent spike.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the method, so we choose the weighted average because it gives more importance to recent data.\n\n   We'll use the weighted average with weights increasing by 1 from the oldest (1) to the newest (5).\n\n   Steps:\n        For hour h in [0,23]:\n          values = [ \n              value from Tuesday (2015-10-06) at hour h, \n              value from Wednesday (2015-10-07) at hour h,\n              value from Thursday (2015-10-08) at hour h,\n              value from Friday (2015-10-09) at hour h,\n              value from Monday (2015-10-12) at hour h\n          ]\n          weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n          forecast_h = (v0*1 + v1*2 + v2*3 + v3*4 + v4*5) / 15\n\n   We note: the days are in order: Tuesday (oldest) to Monday (newest).\n\n   But wait: the Monday is the day immediately before the forecast day, so it is the most recent.\n\n   We'll do this for each hour.\n\n   However, note that the data for Monday (2015-10-12) is the last day in the data.\n\n   Let's extract the data by hour:\n\n        Hour0: \n            Tue: 12.32\n            Wed: 11.33\n            Thu: 15.26\n            Fri: 18.93\n            Mon: 20.21   -> weighted average: (12.32*1 + 11.33*2 + 15.26*3 + 18.93*4 + 20.21*5) / 15 = (12.32 + 22.66 + 45.78 + 75.72 + 101.05) / 15 = 257.53/15 = 17.1687 \u2248 17.17\n\n        Hour1:\n            Tue: 11.50\n            Wed: 11.28\n            Thu: 15.13\n            Fri: 18.69\n            Mon: 19.60\n            Calculation: 11.50*1 + 11.28*2 + 15.13*3 + 18.69*4 + 19.60*5 = 11.50 + 22.56 + 45.39 + 74.76 + 98.00 = 252.21\n            Average: 252.21/15 = 16.814 \u2248 16.81\n\n   We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n   But note: the problem says we must handle missing values. In our case, we don't have missing values in the historical data. So we proceed.\n\n   We are to forecast 24 hours starting from 2015-10-13 00:00 to 2015-10-13 23:00.\n\n   We'll generate the forecast for each hour.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated method if we had more data, but with the given data, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n   Let's compute the 24 hours:\n\n   We'll create a table:\n\n   Hour | Tue (2015-10-06) | Wed (2015-10-07) | Thu (2015-10-08) | Fri (2015-10-09) | Mon (2015-10-12) | Weighted Sum | Forecast (Weighted Sum / 15)\n\n   We do:\n\n   Hour0: \n        Tue: 12.32, Wed: 11.33, Thu: 15.26, Fri: 18.93, Mon: 20.21\n        Weighted Sum = 12.32*1 + 11.33*2 + 15.26*3 + 18.93*4 + 20.21*5 = 12.32 + 22.66 + 45.78 + 75.72 + 101.05 = 257.53\n        Forecast = 257.53 / 15 = 17.168666... -> 17.17\n\n   We'll round to two decimals as the input data.\n\n   Let's do the same for all:\n\n   We'll write a small program in our mind:\n\n        hours = [0,1,2,...,23]\n        tue = [12.32, 11.50, 11.18, 11.17, 10.16] ... but we have 24 values for each day.\n\n        Actually, we have the data in order. We can group by day and then by hour.\n\n        The data is given in chronological order. The first 24 hours are Tuesday, then next 24 Wednesday, etc.\n\n        We can extract:\n\n        tue = data[0:24]   # 0 to 23\n        wed = data[24:48]   # 24 to 47\n        thu = data[48:72]   # 48 to 71\n        fri = data[72:96]   # 72 to 95\n        sat = data[96:120]  # 96 to 119\n        sun = data[120:144] # 120 to 143\n        mon = data[144:168] # 144 to 167\n\n        But note: we are only using weekdays? We are using Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday (which is a weekday). We skip Saturday and Sunday.\n\n        So for each hour h in 0..23:\n\n            values = [ tue[h], wed[h], thu[h], fri[h], mon[h] ]\n\n        Then apply the weights.\n\n   We'll do the calculation for each hour.\n\n   We'll write the forecast for 2015-10-13 00:00 to 2015-10-13 23:00.\n\n   Let me extract the values for each day by hour:\n\n        Tuesday (2015-10-06): \n
