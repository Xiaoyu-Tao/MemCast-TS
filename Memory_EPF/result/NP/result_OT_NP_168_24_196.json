        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity prices (from 2016-10-04 00:00 to 2016-10-10 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016-10-11 00:00 to 2016-10-11 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and not the grid load forecasts or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the price data, we can use a time series model that captures the daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly patterns. However, note that the data provided is only 7 days (1 week). \n\n Given the short history and the requirement for a 24-hour forecast, we can use:\n   - A simple approach: Use the average of the same hour from the previous days (e.g., average of all 00:00, then 01:00, etc.) for the next day.\n   - Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated model like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing, but without additional features and with only 168 points, we might stick to a simpler method.\n\n However, note that the data shows a clear daily pattern and also a change in the last day (2016-10-10) where prices are significantly higher. This might be due to a Monday effect (2016-10-10 is a Monday) and the previous days are from Tuesday to Sunday? Let's check:\n\n  2016-10-04: Tuesday\n  2016-10-05: Wednesday\n  2016-10-06: Thursday\n  2016-10-07: Friday\n  2016-10-08: Saturday\n  2016-10-09: Sunday\n  2016-10-10: Monday\n\n We are to forecast 2016-10-11: Tuesday.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can look at the previous Tuesday (2016-10-04) and also consider the pattern of the most recent days.\n\n But note: the last day (Monday, 2016-10-10) had a spike. We don't know the reason (could be due to lower wind, higher demand, etc.), but without additional data we must rely on the price series.\n\n Considering the above, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days, especially the same day of the previous week and the immediate past days.\n\n Proposed method:\n   For each hour (0 to 23) of the forecast day (Tuesday, 11th Oct 2016), we take:\n     - The same hour from the previous Tuesday (4th Oct) and\n     - The same hour from the last day (Monday, 10th Oct) and\n     - The same hour from the day before (Sunday, 9th Oct) and\n     - The same hour from the day before that (Saturday, 8th Oct) ... but we have limited data.\n\n However, we only have one week of data. So we can do:\n\n   Option 1: Use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days. But the pattern on Monday (10th) is very different.\n\n   Option 2: Use a weighted average where the most recent days have higher weights. For example, we can assign weights that decay as we go back.\n\n   Weights: \n        Day -1 (Monday, 10th): weight 4\n        Day -2 (Sunday, 9th): weight 2\n        Day -3 (Saturday, 8th): weight 1\n        Day -4 (Friday, 7th): weight 1\n        Day -5 (Thursday, 6th): weight 1\n        Day -6 (Wednesday, 5th): weight 1\n        Day -7 (Tuesday, 4th): weight 2   (because same day of the week)\n\n   Then the forecast for hour h = (4 * price_h of 10th + 2 * price_h of 9th + 1 * price_h of 8th + 1 * price_h of 7th + 1 * price_h of 6th + 1 * price_h of 5th + 2 * price_h of 4th) / (4+2+1+1+1+1+2) = 12\n\n   Alternatively, we can also consider the moving average of the last 3 days (which includes Monday, Sunday, Saturday) for the same hour, and then adjust by the weekly pattern (the difference between the previous Tuesday and the average of the previous week's same day).\n\n   However, given the simplicity and the data, I will use the weighted average as above.\n\n   But note: the spike on Monday (10th) might be an anomaly? Or the start of a new pattern? We don't have context. Since we are forecasting for Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was 25.63 at 0:00, but the Monday we don't have (only one week). So we rely on the available data.\n\n   Let's calculate for hour 0:00 (the first hour to forecast, 2016-10-11 00:00):\n\n        We have:\n          2016-10-04 00:00: 25.63   (weight=2)\n          2016-10-05 00:00: 25.48   (weight=1)  # but note: this is Wednesday, not Tuesday? Actually, we are using all days but with different weights.\n\n        Actually, I defined weights by recency and same day of the week. But the same day of the week (Tuesday) we have only one: 2016-10-04. So we can adjust:\n\n        Weights by day of week: \n          Same day of the week (Tuesday): we have 2016-10-04 -> weight 3\n          The most recent day (Monday): weight 4\n          Then the rest: weight 1 for each.\n\n        But then we have 7 days: \n          Tuesday (4th): weight 3\n          Wednesday (5th): weight 1\n          Thursday (6th): weight 1\n          Friday (7th): weight 1\n          Saturday (8th): weight 1\n          Sunday (9th): weight 1\n          Monday (10th): weight 4\n\n        Total weight = 3+1+1+1+1+1+4 = 12\n\n        For hour 0:00:\n          = (3*25.63 + 1*25.48 + 1*27.00 + 1*28.05 + 1*28.55 + 1*29.07 + 4*29.07) / 12\n\n        But note: the last two days (Sunday and Monday) at 0:00 are 29.07? Actually:\n\n          2016-10-09 0:00: 28.55\n          2016-10-10 0:00: 29.07\n\n        So:\n          = [3*25.63 + 25.48 + 27.00 + 28.05 + 28.55 + 29.07 + 4*29.07] / 12\n          = [76.89 + 25.48 + 27.00 + 28.05 + 28.55 + 29.07 + 116.28] / 12\n          = 76.89+25.48=102.37; +27=129.37; +28.05=157.42; +28.55=185.97; +29.07=215.04; +116.28=331.32\n          = 331.32 / 12 = 27.61\n\n        However, note that the Monday (10th) 0:00 is 29.07 and we are giving it 4 times, and the previous Tuesday (4th) 25.63 is 3 times.\n\n        But wait: the Monday 0:00 is the start of the day, and we are forecasting for Tuesday 0:00. The Monday 0:00 is actually the hour after Sunday 23:00, so it might be more similar to Sunday night? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use only the same hour from the last 7 days without distinguishing the day of week, but with exponential decay. \n\n        Given the complexity and without more data, I will use a simpler method: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (Monday, Saturday, Sunday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). But the problem is we have only one Tuesday.\n\n        Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days and adjust by the overall trend. But we don't have a clear trend.\n\n        Considering the spike on Monday, it might be due to the start of the work week. Then Tuesday might be similar? But we don't have a previous Monday to compare.\n\n        After reevaluating, I think the weighted average with the same as above is acceptable.\n\n        However, note that the data on 2016-10-10 (Monday) is significantly higher than the rest. It might be an outlier? But we have to consider it because it is the most recent.\n\n        Let me recalc for 0:00 without the same day of the week weight, but with exponential smoothing. We can use:\n\n          forecast = alpha * (most recent value) + (1-alpha) * (previous forecast)\n\n        But we are forecasting 24 hours ahead, so we need a model for each hour.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the same hour from the previous day (Monday) for Tuesday? But that would be:\n\n          forecast for 2016-10-11 00:00 = 29.07 (the Monday 00:00) -> but that might be too high? because the previous Tuesday was 25.63.\n\n        Or use the average of the same hour of the last two Tuesdays? but we have only one.\n\n        Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n          We use the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). We give double weight to the Monday and the same day last week.\n\n          For hour h:\n            forecast = (2 * price_h_Mon + 1 * price_h_Sun + 1 * price_h_Sat + 2 * price_h_last_Tue) / (2+1+1+2) = 6\n\n        For 0:00:\n          = (2*29.07 + 1*28.55 + 1*28.55? wait, Saturday 0:00 is 2016-10-08 0:00: 28.05? and Sunday 0:00: 28.55, and last Tuesday: 25.63, Monday: 29.07)\n\n          Actually, Saturday 0:00: 2016-10-08 00:00 -> 28.05\n          Sunday 0:00: 2016-10-09 00:00 -> 28.55\n          Monday 0:00: 2016-10-10 00:00 -> 29.07\n          Last Tuesday 0:00: 2016-10-04 00:00 -> 25.63\n\n          So: (2*29.07 + 28.55 + 28.05 + 2*25.63) / 6\n          = (58.14 + 28.55 + 28.05 + 51.26) / 6\n          = 165.00 / 6 = 27.50\n\n        This is between the last Tuesday and the recent days.\n\n        Let's try for a known hour to see if it makes sense? For example, the peak hour on Monday (7:00) was 37.47. What would we forecast for Tuesday 7:00?\n\n          Last Tuesday (4th) 7:00: 29.61\n          Saturday (8th) 7:00: 28.63\n          Sunday (9th) 7:00: 28.60\n          Monday (10th) 7:00: 37.47\n\n          Forecast = (2*37.47 + 28.60 + 28.63 + 2*29.61) / 6\n          = (74.94 + 28.60 + 28.63 + 59.22) / 6\n          = 191.39 / 6 = 31.90\n\n        This is higher than the previous Tuesday but lower than Monday. It seems reasonable.\n\n        However, note that the peak on Monday might be due to the start of the work week. Tuesday might be similar? But we don't have data to confirm.\n\n        We'll use this method.\n\n        Steps for each hour (0 to 23) for the forecast day (2016-10-11):\n\n          Let:\n            last_tuesday = the same hour on 2016-10-04\n            saturday = the same hour on 2016-10-08\n            sunday = the same hour on 2016-10-09\n            monday = the same hour on 2016-10-10\n\n          forecast_h = (2 * monday + 1 * sunday + 1 * saturday + 2 * last_tuesday) / 6.0\n\n        We'll compute for each hour.\n\n        But note: the data for 2016-10-04 (Tuesday) is the first day we have. We have 7 days: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\n        We have:\n          last_tuesday: 2016-10-04\n          saturday: 2016-10-08\n          sunday: 2016-10-09\n          monday: 2016-10-10\n\n        We'll do this for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n        However, note that the data for 2016-10-10 has a spike in the morning (6:00 to 9:00). We are capturing that by giving double weight to Monday.\n\n        Let's compute the 24 hours.\n\n        We'll write a small table:\n\n        Hour | last_tuesday (4th) | saturday (8th) | sunday (9th) | monday (10th) | forecast\n        0:   25.63,             28.05,         28.55,        29.07,        (2*29.07 + 28.55 + 28.05 + 2*25.63)/6 = (58.14+28.55+28.05+51.26)/6 = 165.00/6 = 27.50\n

</answer>\n\n        But note: the input data has the date format as \"YYYY/MM/DD\", so we use 2016/10/11.\n\n        We must be cautious: the last historical data is 2016/10/10 23:00, so the next day is 2016/10/11.\n\n        This forecast is based on a simple weighted average and does not use advanced models. In practice, one would use more sophisticated models and include other variables (like load forecast, wind, etc.) if available.\n\n        Since we are only given the price, we use this method.\n\n        Let's output the forecast.\n\n        Note: The problem says to handle missing values, but there are none in the provided data.\n\n        We output the 24 hours as above.\n\n        We'll write the answer in the required format.\n",
