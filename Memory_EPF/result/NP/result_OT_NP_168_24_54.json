        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/1/14 0:00 to 2014/1/20 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/1/21 0:00 to 2014/1/21 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have to handle missing values (though in the provided data there are no missing values in the given sample), we can proceed with a forecasting method.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only given the historical observed prices. Therefore, as an expert, we must rely solely on the historical price data for this task.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a time series forecasting method. Given the hourly data and the need to capture daily seasonality (24-hour cycle), we can use a model that accounts for seasonality. A simple but effective method for such short-term forecasting is the Seasonal Naive method, where we forecast each hour by taking the value from the same hour of the previous day. However, we note that the data shows weekly patterns? But we only have one week of data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But we have exactly 7 days (168 hours) of data. So we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the past 7 days and use that as the forecast.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the weekdays (Monday to Friday) have different patterns than the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). The last day in the data is Monday (2014/1/20). The next day is Tuesday (2014/1/21). Therefore, we might want to use the average of the same hour from the previous weekdays (i.e., the same day of the week) for which we have data.\n\n But note: \n 2014/1/14: Tuesday\n 2014/1/15: Wednesday\n 2014/1/16: Thursday\n 2014/1/17: Friday\n 2014/1/18: Saturday\n 2014/1/19: Sunday\n 2014/1/20: Monday\n\n We are forecasting for 2014/1/21: Tuesday.\n\n So we can take the average of the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014/1/14) and also the same hour from the same day of the week in the previous week? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the problem does not specify the method, so we choose a reasonable approach.\n\n Considering the simplicity and the fact that we have exactly one week of data, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014/1/14, which is Tuesday) as the forecast for 2014/1/21 (also Tuesday). This is a seasonal naive forecast with seasonality of 7 days.\n\n Option 2: Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, and we have only one Tuesday in the data, we can also consider the average of the same hour over the last few days? But note that the pattern on Tuesday might be different from Monday or Wednesday.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the prices on 2014/1/14 (Tuesday) and 2014/1/15 (Wednesday) are different. Therefore, using only the same day of the previous week might be reasonable.\n\n But what if we want to incorporate more recent trend? We can also consider a combination of the previous day (Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). However, without more data we cannot build a complex model.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use the seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 7 days. That is, the forecast for 2014/1/21 0:00 is the same as 2014/1/14 0:00, and so on.\n\n However, note that the data for 2014/1/14 (Tuesday) is:\n\n 0:00 30.34\n 1:00 29.63\n 2:00 29.55\n 3:00 29.14\n 4:00 29.45\n 5:00 31.37\n 6:00 37.77\n 7:00 48.24\n 8:00 51.87\n 9:00 53.02\n10:00 52.24\n11:00 52.25\n12:00 52.05\n13:00 45.96\n14:00 47.16\n15:00 48.10\n16:00 50.02\n17:00 54.99\n18:00 48.01\n19:00 42.42\n20:00 36.83\n21:00 35.15\n22:00 33.05\n23:00 31.10\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2014/1/21 would be:\n\n 0:00 30.34\n 1:00 29.63\n 2:00 29.55\n 3:00 29.14\n 4:00 29.45\n 5:00 31.37\n 6:00 37.77\n 7:00 48.24\n 8:00 51.87\n 9:00 53.02\n10:00 52.24\n11:00 52.25\n12:00 52.05\n13:00 45.96\n14:00 47.16\n15:00 48.10\n16:00 50.02\n17:00 54.99\n18:00 48.01\n19:00 42.42\n20:00 36.83\n21:00 35.15\n22:00 33.05\n23:00 31.10\n\n But note: the problem says \"handle missing values carefully\". In the provided data, there are no missing values. So we are safe.\n\n However, we must consider if this is the best approach. The data from the previous Tuesday (2014/1/14) is one week before, and the recent days (like Monday 2014/1/20) show a different pattern? For example, the price on Monday 2014/1/20 at 0:00 was 29.99, which is lower than the Tuesday a week ago (30.34). Also, the overall level of prices in the last few days seems lower than the beginning of the week (2014/1/14 to 2014/1/17). Therefore, we might adjust the level of the forecast by the recent trend.\n\n We can compute the average change in the level of the last day (Monday) compared to the same day a week ago (Monday 2014/1/13, but we don't have that). Alternatively, we can compare the average of the last 24 hours (Monday 2014/1/20) with the average of the same Monday a week ago? But we don't have 2014/1/13.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a drift in the seasonal naive method. We can adjust the forecast by the trend of the last week. The trend can be computed as the average of the last 24 hours (Monday) minus the average of the 24 hours from the same day of the previous week (Monday a week ago). But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Since we only have from 2014/1/14 (Tuesday) to 2014/1/20 (Monday), we can compare the average of 2014/1/20 (Monday) with the average of 2014/1/13? We don't have 2014/1/13.\n\n Therefore, without the data of 2014/1/13, we cannot compute a drift for Monday. So we might skip the drift.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the entire week and then adjust by the overall trend? But we only have one week.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only asked for a short-term forecast, we stick to the seasonal naive method with a 7-day seasonality.\n\n However, note that the data shows a weekly pattern? The weekend (2014/1/18 and 2014/1/19) had lower prices and a flatter curve. The Tuesday we are forecasting is a weekday, so using the previous Tuesday (which is a weekday) is reasonable.\n\n Therefore, we output the same values as the same day of the previous week.\n\n But note: the problem says \"the dataset comes from the Nord Pool electricity market and contains hourly records of grid load forecasts, wind power forecasts, and observed electricity prices\". However, we are only given the observed electricity prices. So we cannot use the other variables.\n\n Therefore, we proceed with the seasonal naive method.\n\n Forecast for the next 24 hours (2014/1/21 0:00 to 2014/1/21 23:00) is:\n\n 2014/1/21 0:00 30.34\n 2014/1/21 1:00 29.63\n 2014/1/21 2:00 29.55\n 2014/1/21 3:00 29.14\n 2014/1/21 4:00 29.45\n 2014/1/21 5:00 31.37\n 2014/1/21 6:00 37.77\n 2014/1/21 7:00 48.24\n 2014/1/21 8:00 51.87\n 2014/1/21 9:00 53.02\n2014/1/21 10:00 52.24\n2014/1/21 11:00 52.25\n2014/1/21 12:00 52.05\n2014/1/21 13:00 45.96\n2014/1/21 14:00 47.16\n2014/1/21 15:00 48.10\n2014/1/21 16:00 50.02\n2014/1/21 17:00 54.99\n2014/1/21 18:00 48.01\n2014/1/21 19:00 42.42\n2014/1/21 20:00 36.83\n2014/1/21 21:00 35.15\n2014/1/21 22:00 33.05\n2014/1/21 23:00 31.10\n\n However, note that the last day in the historical data (Monday 2014/1/20) had a peak at 45.23 (at 17:00) and the previous Tuesday had a peak at 54.99. The recent Monday was lower than the previous Tuesday? But we don't have the previous Monday to compare. So we stick to the seasonal naive.\n\n But let me check: the average of the entire week (168 hours) is about 37.5, and the average of the previous Tuesday (2014/1/14) is about 42.5. The average of the last day (Monday 2014/1/20) is about 35.5. So there might be a downward trend. However, without more data, we cannot be sure.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average: 50% of the same day last week and 50% of the previous day (Monday) at the same hour? But the previous day is Monday and we are forecasting Tuesday, so the pattern might be different.\n\n We decide to use the seasonal naive without adjustment because we don't have enough data to estimate a trend.\n\n Therefore, the forecast is as above.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"short-term electricity price forecasting\", and in practice, more sophisticated methods (like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning) might be used. But without the additional variables (load and wind) and without a longer history, we use a simple method.\n\n We output the forecast in the required format.\n",
