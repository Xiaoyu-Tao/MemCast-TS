        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013/8/20 0:00 to 2013/8/26 23:00) and need to forecast the next 24 hours (from 2013/8/27 0:00 to 2013/8/27 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values in the provided data. The data provided seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours).\n 2. We note that the data exhibits daily seasonality (prices are higher during the day and lower at night) and also weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n However, the problem states that we have additional data (grid load forecasts, wind power forecasts) but only the observed electricity prices (OT) are provided. Since we are only given OT, we must base our forecast solely on the historical OT.\n\n Approach:\n Given the constraints, we can use a time series forecasting method that captures seasonality. Since we are to forecast 24 hours (one day) and we have 7 days of data, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: use the same hour from the previous day (or same day of the week) as the forecast.\n   - But note: the last day in the data is Monday (2013/8/26) and we are forecasting Tuesday (2013/8/27). We can use the previous Monday (2013/8/19) but that is not provided. We only have from 2013/8/20 (Tuesday) to 2013/8/26 (Monday).\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   - The average of the same hour over the available days (but note: weekdays and weekends have different patterns).\n\n However, we have:\n   - 2013/8/20: Tuesday\n   - 2013/8/21: Wednesday\n   - 2013/8/22: Thursday\n   - 2013/8/23: Friday\n   - 2013/8/24: Saturday\n   - 2013/8/25: Sunday\n   - 2013/8/26: Monday\n\n We are forecasting 2013/8/27: Tuesday.\n\n So we can use the average of the same hour on the previous Tuesday (2013/8/20) and also the Monday (2013/8/26) might be less relevant? But note: the pattern of Tuesday might be similar to the previous Tuesday? However, we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But without additional data, we have to rely on simple methods.\n\n Considering the requirement for a simple and robust method, we can use:\n   - The average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are different.\n\n Another idea: use the same hour from the same day of the week. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2013/8/20) and adjust with the overall trend? But we don't have a long history.\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the prices on 2013/8/20 (Tuesday) and 2013/8/26 (Monday) are both weekdays and might be similar patterns? But the Monday (2013/8/26) has higher prices than the previous Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the last few days, giving more weight to the most recent days and also to the same day of the week.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert and we must handle missing values. In this data, there are no missing values.\n\n Since we are only given the OT and no other features, we don't have the grid load or wind power forecasts for the future), we cannot use a model that requires those.\n\n Therefore, I propose to use a simple average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday? but we are forecasting a Tuesday) and we have one Tuesday and then the Monday? But Monday is the day before.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would include weekend days which are different.\n\n Let me check the data for the weekend (2013/8/24 and 2013/8/25) and compare to weekdays. The weekend has lower prices.\n\n So for forecasting a weekday (Tuesday), we should use only the weekdays in the past week.\n\n The weekdays in the data:\n   Tuesday: 2013/8/20\n   Wednesday: 2013/8/21\n   Thursday: 2013/8/22\n   Friday: 2013/8/23\n   Monday: 2013/8/26\n\n We are missing a Tuesday? We have one Tuesday (2013/8/20) and then the next Tuesday we are forecasting.\n\n We can use the average of the same hour over the last 5 weekdays? But note: the Monday (2013/8/26) is the most recent and might be the most relevant.\n\n However, the day of the week effect: Tuesdays might be more similar to previous Tuesdays than to Mondays? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   - The average of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (excluding the weekend) for each hour.\n\n But note: the data shows a slight downward trend? Let's see the average for the same hour (e.g., 0:00) over the weekdays:\n\n   0:00:\n      2013/8/20: 32.46\n      2013/8/21: 32.25\n      2013/8/22: 32.42\n      2013/8/23: 32.95\n      2013/8/26: 33.00\n\n   Average: (32.46+32.25+32.42+32.95+33.00)/5 = 32.616\n\n But the last value (2013/8/26) is 33.00, which is higher than the previous Tuesday. So the average might be a good choice.\n\n However, we can also consider using a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days. For example, weights: [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3] for the days from oldest to most recent (2013/8/20 to 2013/8/26). Then:\n\n   0:00: 32.46*0.1 + 32.25*0.15 + 32.42*0.2 + 32.95*0.25 + 33.00*0.3 = \n         = 3.246 + 4.8375 + 6.484 + 8.2375 + 9.9 = 32.705\n\n But without a clear trend, the simple average might be sufficient.\n\n However, note that the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included. We are forecasting a weekday.\n\n Let's try to compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) using the 5 weekdays.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n   Let h be the hour (0 to 23)\n   Collect the OT at hour h for each of the 5 weekdays: 2013/8/20, 2013/8/21, 2013/8/22, 2013/8/23, 2013/8/26.\n   Compute the average for that hour.\n\n But note: the last day (2013/8/26) is a Monday and we are forecasting a Tuesday. The Monday might be more similar to the Tuesday than the Friday? But we don't have evidence.\n\n Alternatively, we can also consider the median to avoid outliers? But the data doesn't show extreme values.\n\n Since the data is stable, we don't see big jumps, the average should be fine.\n\n However, we note that the prices on 2013/8/26 (Monday) are generally higher than the previous Tuesday (2013/8/20). So the average will be a blend.\n\n Let me compute the average for each hour:\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the values for that hour across the 5 weekdays.\n\n But note: the data for 2013/8/20 (Tuesday) is the first day and 2013/8/26 (Monday) is the last.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   hour0 = [32.46, 2013/8/20 0:00\n            32.25, 2013/8/21 0:00\n            32.42, 2013/8/22 0:00\n            32.95, 2013/8/23 0:00\n            33.00] 2013/8/26 0:00 -> average = (32.46+32.25+32.42+32.95+33.00)/5 = 32.616\n\n   hour1 = [32.04, 31.80, 32.00, 32.21, 32.07] -> (32.04+31.80+32.00+32.21+32.07)/5 = 31.824\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for 2013/8/26 1:00 is 32.07? Actually:\n\n   2013/8/20 1:00: 32.04\n   2013/8/21 1:00: 31.80\n   2013/8/22 1:00: 32.00\n   2013/8/23 1:00: 32.21\n   2013/8/26 1:00: 32.07\n\n   Average: (32.04+31.80+32.00+32.21+32.07)/5 = 31.824\n\n We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n However, we must consider that the last day (Monday) might be more influence? But without a clear trend, we stick to the simple average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the median? Let's see for hour0: the values are [32.25, 32.42, 32.46, 32.95, 33.00] -> sorted: [32.25, 32.42, 32.46, 32.95, 33.00] -> median=32.46.\n\n But the average is 32.616 and median 32.46. The average is slightly higher because of the last two days.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday and the previous Tuesday was 32.46 at hour0, and the Monday was 33.00, the average 32.616 seems reasonable.\n\n We'll use the average for each hour.\n\n But note: the weekend days are not included because they are not weekdays. We are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday, 2013/8/27).\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour from 0 to 23 using the 5 weekdays.\n\n We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then compute the average.\n\n However, note: the data for the same hour might be missing in one of the days? But in our data, we have 5 values for each hour.\n\n We'll compute:\n\n   For hour in range(0,24):\n        values = [ value at that hour for 2013/8/20, 2013/8/21, 2013/8/22, 2013/8/23, 2013/8/26]\n        forecast = sum(values) / 5\n\n But note: the dates in the data are given in order. We can extract the hour from the time.\n\n However, the data is given in order and the first 24 hours are 2013/8/20, then next 24 for 2013/8/21, etc.\n\n We can restructure the data by day and hour.\n\n Steps:\n\n   Let's create a 2D list: days x hours.\n\n   days = 7, but we only need the weekdays: 5 days (index 0: Tuesday, 2013/8/20; index 1: Wednesday, 2: Thursday, 3: Friday, 4: Monday)\n\n   Actually, the last day (Monday) is the 7th day? The data:\n\n        Day0: 2013/8/20 (Tuesday) -> index0: 0:00 to 23:00 -> rows 0 to 23\n        Day1: 2013/8/21 (Wednesday) -> rows 24 to 47\n        Day2: 2013/8/22 (Thursday) -> rows 48 to 71\n        Day3: 2013/8/23 (Friday) -> rows 72 to 95\n        Day4: 2013/8/24 (Saturday) -> skip (weekend)\n        Day5: 2013/8/25 (Sunday) -> skip\n        Day6: 2013/8/26 (Monday) -> rows 144 to 167\n\n   So we want to take:\n\n        Tuesday: rows 0 to 23\n        Wednesday: rows 24 to 47\n        Thursday: rows 48 to 71\n        Friday: rows 72 to 95\n        Monday: rows 144 to 167\n\n   Then for hour h (0 to 23), we take:\n\n        Tuesday: row h (index h)\n        Wednesday: row 24+h\n        Thursday: row 48+h\n        Friday: row 72+h\n        Monday: row 144+h\n\n   Then average the 5 values.\n\n Let me do an example for hour0 (0:00):\n\n        Tuesday: row0 -> 32.46\n        Wednesday: row24 -> 32.25\n        Thursday: row48 -> 32.42\n        Friday: row72 -> 32.95\n        Monday: row144 -> 33.00\n\n   Average: (32.46+32.25+32.42+32.95+33.00)/5 = 32.616\n\n Now, we do this for every hour.\n\n We'll generate 24 forecasted prices for 2013/8/27 (Tuesday) from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n But note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included because we are forecasting a weekday and we want to use only weekdays.\n\n However, we must consider: is Monday a good predictor for Tuesday? It is the next day, so it might be. And we have included it.\n\n Let's compute the forecast:\n\n   We'll create a list for the next 24 hours.\n\n   For h in 0 to 23:\n\n        values = [ \n            data[h][OT],   # Tuesday (2013/8/20) at hour h\n            data[24+h][OT], # Wednesday (2013/8/21) at hour h\n            data[48+h][OT], # Thursday (2013/8/22) at hour h\n            data[72+h][OT], # Friday (2013/8/23) at hour h\n            data[144+h][OT]  # Monday (2013/8/26) at hour h\n        ]\n\n        forecast_h = sum(values) / 5.0\n\n Then we output the forecast for 2013/8/27 from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n However, note: the data for Monday is at indices 144 to 167.\n\n But let me check the data: the first row is 2013/8/20 0:00 -> index0, then 1:00 index1, ... 23:00 index23.\n Then 2013/8/21 0:00 is index24, ... 2013/8/21 23:00 index47.\n Then 2013/8/22 0:00 index48, ... 2013/8/22 23:00 index71.\n Then 2013/8/23 0:00 index72, ... 2013/8/23 23:00 index95.\n Then 2013/8/24 0:00 index96, ... 2013/8/24 23:00 index119.\n Then 2013/8/25 0:00 index120, ... 2013/8/25 23:00 index143.\n Then 2013/8/26 0:00 index144, ... 2013/8/26 23:00 index167.\n\n So the Monday is at indices 144 to 167.\n\n We'll compute the average for each hour.\n\n But note: the weekend days (2013/8/24 and 2013/8/25) are not used.\n\n Let's compute the forecast:\n\n   Hour 0: h=0 -> [0,24,48,72,144] -> indices: 0,24,48,72,144 -> values: [32.46, 32.25, 32.42, 32.95, 33.00] -> 32.616\n   Hour 1: h=1 -> [1,25,49,73,145] -> [32.04, 31.80, 32.00, 32.21, 32.07] -> (32.04+31.80+32.00+32.21+32.07)/5 = 31.824\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll do for all 24 hours.\n\n However, we must round to two decimals? The input data has two decimals.\n\n We'll round to two decimals.\n\n But note: the problem does not to omit any values, so we output 24 values.\n\n Let me compute a few more:\n\n   Hour 2: h=2 -> [31.60, 31.36, 31.30, 31.49, 31.85] \n        = (31.60+31.36+31.30+31.49+31.85)/5 = 31.52\n\n   Hour 3: h=3 -> [31.73, 31.34, 31.36, 31.57, 31.81]\n        = (31.73+31.34+31.36+31.57+31.81)/5 = 31.562\n\n   Hour 4: h=4 -> [32.05, 31.79, 31.68, 31.91, 32.09]\n        = (32.05+31.79+31.68+31.91+32.09)/5 = 31.904\n\n   Hour 5: h=5 -> [32.92, 32.42, 32.96, 32.97, 33.38]\n        = (32.92+32.42+32.96+32.97+33.38)/5 = 32.93\n\n   Hour 6: h=6 -> [35.45, 35.99, 36.19, 36.55, 36.02]\n        = (35.45+35.99+36.19+36.55+36.02)/5 = 36.04\n\n   Hour 7: h=7 -> [38.02, 38.70, 38.18, 39.05, 39.03]\n        = (38.02+38.70+38.18+39.05+39.03)/5 = 38.596 -> 38.60\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n We'll write a program to compute all 24.\n\n But since we are doing by hand, we can do it for all 24.\n\n However, we are an expert and we can write a script. But in this response, we'll compute manually.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a table:\n\n   h | indices | values | average\n\n   h0: [0,24,48,72,144] -> [32.46,32.25,32.42,32.95,33.00] -> 32.616 -> 32.62\n   h1: [1,25,49,73,145] -> [32.04,31.80,32.00,32.21,32.07] -> 31.824 -> 31.82\n   h2: [2,26,50,74,146] -> [31.60,31.36,31.30,31.49,31.85] -> 31.52 -> 31.52\n   h3: [3,27,51,75,147] -> [31.73,31.34,31.36,31.57,31.81] -> 31.562 -> 31.56\n   h4: [4,28,52,76,148] -> [32.05,31.79,31.68,31.91,32.09] -> 31.904 -> 31.90\n   h5: [5,29,53,77,149] -> [32.92,32.42,32.96,32.97,33.38] -> 32.93 -> 32.93\n   h6: [6,30,54,78,150] -> [35.45,35.99,36.19,36.55,36.02] -> 36.04 -> 36.04\n   h7: [7,31,55,79,151] -> [38.02,38.70,38.18,39.05,39.03] -> 38.596 -> 38.60\n   h8: [8,32,56,80,152] -> [39.28,39.30,39.48,40.81,40.85] -> 39.944 -> 39.94\n   h9: [9,33,57,81,153] -> [39.57,39.19,39.68,40.62,41.51] -> 40.114 -> 40.11\n   h10: [10,34,58,82,154] -> [39.71,39.10,39.73,40.54,41.54] -> 40.124 -> 40.12\n   h11: [11,35,59,83,155] -> [39.48,39.18,39.85,39.64,41.34] -> 39.898 -> 39.90\n   h12: [12,36,60,84,156] -> [39.28,39.07,39.68,39.20,40.37] -> 39.52 -> 39.52\n   h13: [13,37,61,85,157] -> [39.06,39.14,39.34,38.28,40.10] -> 39.184 -> 39.18\n   h14: [14,38,62,86,158] -> [38.80,38.56,38.68,37.41,39.86] -> 38.662 -> 38.66\n        Let me recalc: 38.80+38.56=77.36; 77.36+38.68=116.04; 116.04+37.41=153.45; 153.45+39.86=193.31; 193.31/5=38.662 -> 38.66\n   h15: [15,39,63,87,159] -> [38.23,37.94,38.33,36.43,39.29] -> 38.044 -> 38.04\n        (38.23+37.94=76.17; 76.17+38.33=114.5; 114.5+36.43=150.93; 150.93+39.29=190.22; 190.22/5=38.044)\n   h16: [16,40,64,88,160] -> [38.33,38.20,38.40,36.33,39.04] -> 38.06 -> 38.06\n        (38.33+38.20=76.53; 76.53+38.40=114.93; 114.93+36.33=151.26; 151.26+39.04=190.3; 190.3/5=38.06)\n   h17: [17,41,65,89,161] -> [38.26,38.15,38.55,36.52,39.08] -> 38.112 -> 38.11\n        (38.26+38.15=76.41; 76.41+38.55=114.96; 114.96+36.52=151.48; 151.48+39.08=190.56; 190.56/5=38.112)\n   h18: [18,42,66,90,162] -> [38.20,37.97,38.81,36.25,39.36] -> 38.118 -> 38.12\n        (38.20+37.97=76.17; 76.17+38.81=114.98; 114.98+36.25=151.23; 151.23+39.36=190.59; 190.59/5=38.118)\n   h19: [19,43,67,91,163] -> [38.01,37.38,38.28,36.27,39.28] -> 37.844 -> 37.84\n        (38.01+37.38=75.39; 75.39+38.28=113.67; 113.67+36.27=149.94; 149.94+39.28=189.22; 189.22/5=37.844)\n   h20: [20,44,68,92,164] -> [37.80,37.26,38.44,36.52,39.53] -> 37.91 -> 37.91\n        (37.80+37.26=75.06; 75.06+38.44=113.5; 113.5+36.52=150.02; 150.02+39.53=189.55; 189.55/5=37.91)\n   h21: [21,45,69,93,165] -> [37.87,36.86,37.96,36.23,39.44] -> 37.672 -> 37.67\n        (37.87+36.86=74.73; 74.73+37.96=112.69; 112.69+36.23=148.92; 148.92+39.44=188.36; 188.36/5=37.672)\n   h22: [22,46,70,94,166] -> [36.35,36.02,37.47,35.40,37.91] -> 36.63 -> 36.63\n        (36.35+36.02=72.37; 72.37+37.47=109.84; 109.84+35.40=145.24; 145.24+37.91=183.15; 183.15/5=36.63)\n   h23: [23,47,71,95,167] -> [33.62,33.96,34.98,33.02,34.03] -> 33.922 -> 33.92\n        (33.62+33.96=67.58; 67.58+34.98=102.56; 102.56+33.02=135.58; 135.58+34.03=169.61; 169.61/5=33.922)\n\n So the forecast for 2013/8/27:\n\n   0:00: 32.62\n   1:00: 31.82\n   2:00: 31.52\n   3:00: 31.56\n   4:00: 31.90\n   5:00: 32.93\n   6:00: 36.04\n   7:00: 38.60\n   8:00: 39.94\n   9:00: 40.11\n   10:00: 40.12\n   11:00: 39.90\n   12:00: 39.52\n   13:00: 39.18\n   14:00: 38.66\n   15:00: 38.04\n   16:00: 38.06\n   17:00: 38.11\n   18:00: 38.12\n   19:00: 37.84\n   20:00: 37.91\n   21:00: 37.67\n   22:00: 36.63\n   23:00: 33.92\n\n We output these 24 values.\n\n But note: the problem says we must provide the complete forecast for the next 24 hours without omitting any values.\n\n We'll output in the required format.\n\n However, note: the date for the forecast is 2013/8/27.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2013/8/27 0:00 32.62\n        2013/8/27 1:00 31.82\n        ... \n        2013/8/27 23:00 33.92\n    </answer>\n\n We'll write the dates accordingly.\n\n But note: the input format for date was \"2013/8/20 0:00\", so we use the same.\n\n Let's write the answer.\n",
