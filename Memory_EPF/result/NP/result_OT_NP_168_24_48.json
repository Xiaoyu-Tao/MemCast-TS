        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (7 days * 24 hours = 168 hours).\n The data spans from 2013/12/3 0:00 to 2013/12/9 23:00.\n We are to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2013/12/10 0:00 to 2013/12/10 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other variables (like grid load or wind power) in the provided data, we must rely on a time series forecasting method.\n\n However, note: the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only given the OT (observed price) in the historical data. Therefore, we cannot use those additional variables for forecasting unless we are provided with their future values as well. But the problem does not provide future values for grid load or wind power. Hence, we must forecast using only the historical prices.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data does not have any missing values (all 168 hours are present). So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Given the daily seasonality (24 hours) and the weekly pattern (as we have 7 days of data), we can use a seasonal model.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - Daily pattern: prices are lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Weekly pattern: weekdays (Mon-Fri) vs weekends (Sat-Sun) have different patterns.\n\n Since we are forecasting for 2013/12/10, which is a Tuesday (as 2013/12/9 was Monday), we can consider using the same day of the week from the previous week (Tuesday, 2013/12/3) and adjust with recent trends.\n\n But note: the data we have is from 2013/12/3 (Tuesday) to 2013/12/9 (Monday). So we have one full week.\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple method: take the average of the same hour from the last 7 days and then adjust by the trend of the last day.\n\n However, the data shows a spike on 2013/12/9 (Monday) which is unusual compared to the previous days. So we must be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an exponential smoothing model or an ARIMA model with seasonality. But since we are to provide a quick forecast and without the ability to run complex model fitting, we can use a naive seasonal method.\n\n Proposed method:\n Let H(d, h) be the price on day d at hour h (h from 0 to 23).\n\n We are to forecast for day 10 (2013/12/10) at hour h: F(10, h)\n\n We can compute:\n   F(10, h) = (H(3, h) + H(4, h) + H(5, h) + H(6, h) + H(7, h) + H(8, h) + H(9, h)) / 7\n\n But note: the days are:\n   Day 3: 2013/12/3 (Tuesday)\n   Day 4: 2013/12/4 (Wednesday)\n   Day 5: 2013/12/5 (Thursday)\n   Day 6: 2013/12/6 (Friday)\n   Day 7: 2013/12/7 (Saturday)\n   Day 8: 2013/12/8 (Sunday)\n   Day 9: 2013/12/9 (Monday)\n\n Since 2013/12/10 is a Tuesday, we might want to give more weight to the previous Tuesday (2013/12/3) and the Monday (2013/12/9) because of the recent spike.\n\n However, the spike on Monday (2013/12/9) might be an anomaly or the start of a high price period. We note that the prices on Monday were significantly higher than the previous days.\n\n Considering the recent trend, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days.\n\n Weights: \n   Let w_d for d in [3,4,5,6,7,8,9] (with 3 being the oldest and 9 the newest) be: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2] (so Monday gets double weight because it's the most recent and also because Tuesday might be similar to Monday in terms of being a weekday).\n\n Then: F(10, h) = (1*H(3,h) + 1*H(4,h) + 1*H(5,h) + 1*H(6,h) + 1*H(7,h) + 1*H(8,h) + 2*H(9,h)) / (1+1+1+1+1+1+2) = (sum of H(d,h) for d=3 to 8) + 2*H(9,h)) / 8\n\n But note: the weekdays and weekends are different. We might also consider using only the weekdays. However, we have only one Monday and one Tuesday in the data. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   - The previous Tuesday (2013/12/3) and the Monday (2013/12/9) as the main references and then adjust with the overall trend.\n\n However, to keep it simple and given the data, we will use the weighted average as above.\n\n But note: the spike on Monday might be due to a special event? We don't have additional information. So we will use the weighted average.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average with a shorter window. For example, use the last 3 days (Monday, Sunday, Saturday) and the same day of the previous week (Tuesday). But that might be too arbitrary.\n\n After consideration, we will use the weighted average method.\n\n However, let's check the data for the same hour (e.g., 0:00) for the 7 days:\n\n   2013/12/3 0:00: 33.08\n   2013/12/4 0:00: 32.94\n   2013/12/5 0:00: 30.74\n   2013/12/6 0:00: 31.66\n   2013/12/7 0:00: 33.30\n   2013/12/8 0:00: 35.89\n   2013/12/9 0:00: 33.92\n\n The average without weights: (33.08+32.94+30.74+31.66+33.30+35.89+33.92)/7 = 33.075\n With weights: (33.08+32.94+30.74+31.66+33.30+35.89+2*33.92)/8 = (33.08+32.94+30.74+31.66+33.30+35.89+67.84)/8 = 265.45/8 = 33.18125\n\n But note: the price on 2013/12/9 0:00 was 33.92, which is not the spike. The spike happened during the day on 2013/12/9.\n\n So for the hour 0:00, the weighted average is 33.18.\n\n However, we see that the price on 2013/12/8 0:00 was 35.89, which is higher. So the weighted average is a compromise.\n\n We must do this for every hour.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a model that captures the daily pattern and the recent level. We can also consider the change from the previous day.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the same day of the week (Tuesday) and the day before (Monday) and then adjust by the overall change from last Monday to this Monday? But we only have one Tuesday and one Monday.\n\n Given the complexity and the requirement for a quick forecast, we will use the weighted average method for each hour.\n\n Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n   Let d3 = price on 2013/12/3 at hour h\n   d4 = 2013/12/4 at hour h\n   d5 = 2013/12/5 at hour h\n   d6 = 2013/12/6 at hour h\n   d7 = 2013/12/7 at hour h\n   d8 = 2013/12/8 at hour h\n   d9 = 2013/12/9 at hour h\n\n   forecast = (d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 + d8 + 2*d9) / 8\n\n But note: the spike on 2013/12/9 during the day (for example, at 15:00 it was 59.99) is very high. This method will smooth it by including the previous days. However, if the spike is a one-time event, then we might be under-forecasting. But without more context, we use this.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the last day (2013/12/9) as the base and adjust by the average change from the previous Monday (2013/12/2) to Tuesday (2013/12/3) but we don't have 2013/12/2.\n\n Since we don't have data before 2013/12/3, we cannot do that.\n\n Therefore, we will use the weighted average method.\n\n However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values, but there are none. So we proceed.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00 for 2013/12/10.\n\n We'll create a list for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (33.08 + 32.94 + 30.74 + 31.66 + 33.30 + 35.89 + 2*33.92) / 8 = (33.08+32.94+30.74+31.66+33.30+35.89+67.84) = 265.45 -> 265.45/8 = 33.18125 -> 33.18\n   hour1: (32.27 + 31.60 + 30.16 + 31.18 + 33.04 + 34.96 + 2*33.79) / 8 = (32.27+31.60+30.16+31.18+33.04+34.96+67.58) = 260.79 -> 260.79/8 = 32.59875 -> 32.60\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the spike on 2013/12/9 at 15:00 was 59.99. Let's compute that hour:\n\n   hour15: \n        d3: 38.70\n        d4: 37.28\n        d5: 36.88\n        d6: 35.91\n        d7: 36.51\n        d8: 36.16\n        d9: 59.99\n        = (38.70+37.28+36.88+35.91+36.51+36.16 + 2*59.99) / 8\n        = (38.70+37.28+36.88+35.91+36.51+36.16 + 119.98) = 341.42 / 8 = 42.6775 -> 42.68\n\n This is a significant drop from 59.99, but it is an average. We are expecting that the spike might not repeat exactly, but the high prices might continue? However, without more information, we use the model.\n\n We are going to compute for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the problem does not specify the model. We are free to choose. This is a simple and reasonable approach.\n\n Let's consider using the median to avoid the spike? But the spike might be real and we have only one Monday. The weighted average already gives double weight to Monday, so it is already accounting for the spike.\n\n We'll proceed with the weighted average.\n\n We'll compute the forecast for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (33.08, 32.94, 30.74, 31.66, 33.30, 35.89, 33.92, 33.92) -> average = 33.18\n   We have: 33.08, 32.94, 30.74, 31.66, 33.30, 35.89, 33.92 (with weight 1) and 33.92 (extra for weight 2) -> so total 8 numbers? Actually, we are doing: (d3+d4+d5+d6+d7+d8+2*d9)/8.\n\n   We can compute as: (d3+d4+d5+d6+d7+d8) + d9*2 = total, then divide by 8.\n\n We do this for each hour.\n\n We'll write a program in our mind:\n\n   hours = [0,1,...,23]\n   d3 = [33.08, 32.27, 31.32, ...]  # for hour0 to hour23 of 2013/12/3\n   d4 = [32.94, 31.60, ...]\n   d5 = [30.74, ...]\n   d6 = [31.66, ...]\n   d7 = [33.30, ...]\n   d8 = [35.89, ...]\n   d9 = [33.92, ...]\n\n   forecast = []\n   for h in range(24):\n        value = (d3[h] + d4[h] + d5[h] + d6[h] + d7[h] + d8[h] + 2*d9[h]) / 8.0\n        forecast.append(round(value, 2))\n\n But we must be cautious: the data we have is in the order of the hours from 0 to 23 for each day.\n\n We'll extract the data by day:\n\n   Day 3 (2013/12/3):

problem says \"Observed Nord Pool electricity price (\u20ac/MWh, 1-hour resolution)\" and the historical data has two decimal places.\n\n We'll output the forecast with two decimal places.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2013/12/10 0:00 33.18\n        2013/12/10 1:00 32.60\n        ... \n        2013/12/10 23:00 33.95\n    </answer>\n\n But note: the date format in the input was without the extra space? Actually, the input had:\n\n        \"2013/12/3 0:00\" -> but we are outputting \"2013/12/10 0:00\"\n\n We'll write the date as \"2013/12/10\" and then the hour.\n\n Let's write the full 24 lines.\n",
