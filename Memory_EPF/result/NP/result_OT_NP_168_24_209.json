        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2017/1/3 0:00 to 2017/1/9 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2017/1/10 0:00 to 2017/1/10 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values to handle.\n\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the target variable (OT). \n\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily and weekly seasonality. However, the data only covers 7 days, which is one week. We can try to capture daily patterns.\n\n 4. We can use a simple method such as:\n    - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day or the same day of the previous week.\n    - Since we have exactly one week of data, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., use the data from 2017/1/3 to forecast 2017/1/10, because 2017/1/10 is a Tuesday and 2017/1/3 was a Tuesday?).\n\n    But note: \n        2017/1/3: Tuesday\n        2017/1/10: Tuesday (next week same day)\n\n    However, the data we have for the same day of the previous week (2017/1/3) is the first day in our data. But we also have the entire week including the weekend. We might consider using the entire week to capture the weekly pattern.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use an average of the last few days. But without more data, we have to be cautious.\n\n 6. Since the problem does not provide any exogenous variables for the future, we cannot use models that require them.\n\n 7. We can use a simple moving average or exponential smoothing. However, given the seasonality, we can try:\n\n    Option 1: Seasonal Naive by week: \n        Forecast for 2017/1/10 0:00 = value of 2017/1/3 0:00\n        ... until 2017/1/10 23:00 = value of 2017/1/3 23:00\n\n    But note: the data from 2017/1/3 (Tuesday) and 2017/1/10 (Tuesday) might be similar? However, looking at the data, the pattern of the week might have changed. Also, we have more recent data.\n\n    Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (if we assume weekly seasonality). Since we have exactly 7 days, we can compute the average for each hour of the day.\n\n    Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n        Hour 0: average of [30.65 (1/3), 26.63 (1/4), 30.47 (1/5), 33.19 (1/6), 29.13 (1/7), 30.62 (1/8), 29.37 (1/9)]\n        ... and so on for each hour.\n\n 8. However, note that the data shows a spike on 2017/1/5 (Thursday) which might be an outlier. Using the average might smooth that out.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can use the median to be robust to outliers.\n\n10. Given the limited data, we'll use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days.\n\n    Let H_i be the hour of the day (0 to 23). For each H_i, we compute:\n        forecast_H_i = average( price for H_i on day1, day2, ..., day7)\n\n    Then the forecast for 2017/1/10 0:00 is the average of the 0:00 prices of the past 7 days, and so on.\n\n11. Let's calculate:\n\n    Hour 0: (30.65 + 26.63 + 30.47 + 33.19 + 29.13 + 30.62 + 29.37) / 7 = (30.65+26.63=57.28; +30.47=87.75; +33.19=120.94; +29.13=150.07; +30.62=180.69; +29.37=210.06) -> 210.06 / 7 = 30.00857 \u2248 30.01\n\n    Hour 1: (30.37 + 26.20 + 30.18 + 32.76 + 28.40 + 30.49 + 28.94) / 7 = \n        30.37+26.20=56.57; +30.18=86.75; +32.76=119.51; +28.40=147.91; +30.49=178.40; +28.94=207.34 -> 207.34/7 = 29.62\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n12. But note: the data for the last day (2017/1/9) is a Monday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday. The average method uses the entire week including weekends. However, since we are averaging over 7 days, it includes one Tuesday (2017/1/3) and the other days. This might be acceptable.\n\n13. Alternatively, we could use only the same day of the week (i.e., only the previous Tuesday: 2017/1/3). But we have only one Tuesday in the data. So that would be a naive forecast.\n\n14. Considering the trade-off, the average over the week might be more robust.\n\n15. We'll compute the average for each hour of the day (0 to 23) using the 7 days.\n\n16. However, note that the data provided is from 2017/1/3 (Tuesday) to 2017/1/9 (Monday). So we have 7 days: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon.\n\n    We are forecasting for 2017/1/10 (Tuesday). So we have one Tuesday in the past, and the other days. The average will be influenced by the entire week.\n\n17. Another idea: use a weighted average that gives more weight to the same day of the week (Tuesday) and the most recent days. But without a clear model, we stick to simple average.\n\n18. Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n    We'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average.\n\n    Hour 0: [30.65, 26.63, 30.47, 33.19, 29.13, 30.62, 29.37] -> average = 30.01 (rounded to 2 decimals as in the data)\n\n    Hour 1: [30.37, 26.20, 30.18, 32.76, 28.40, 30.49, 28.94] -> \n        = (30.37+26.20+30.18+32.76+28.40+30.49+28.94)/7 = 207.34/7 = 29.62\n\n    Hour 2: [30.15, 25.86, 29.97, 31.94, 27.89, 30.28, 28.81] -> \n        = (30.15+25.86+29.97+31.94+27.89+30.28+28.81) = 204.9 /7 = 29.27\n\n    Hour 3: [30.14, 25.98, 30.02, 31.86, 27.36, 30.29, 28.98] -> \n        = (30.14+25.98+30.02+31.86+27.36+30.29+28.98) = 204.63 /7 = 29.23\n\n    Hour 4: [30.41, 26.36, 30.57, 31.79, 27.70, 30.46, 29.52] -> \n        = (30.41+26.36+30.57+31.79+27.70+30.46+29.52) = 206.81 /7 = 29.54\n\n    Hour 5: [31.30, 27.62, 31.48, 31.57, 28.25, 30.54, 30.23] -> \n        = (31.30+27.62+31.48+31.57+28.25+30.54+30.23) = 210.99 /7 = 30.14\n\n    Hour 6: [32.14, 28.84, 33.50, 32.55, 28.80, 30.63, 30.76] -> \n        = (32.14+28.84+33.50+32.55+28.80+30.63+30.76) = 217.22 /7 = 31.03\n\n    Hour 7: [33.72, 30.43, 38.08, 32.94, 29.29, 30.38, 32.26] -> \n        = (33.72+30.43+38.08+32.94+29.29+30.38+32.26) = 227.1 /7 = 32.44\n\n    Hour 8: [34.39, 31.30, 41.66, 33.27, 29.85, 30.60, 33.01] -> \n        = (34.39+31.30+41.66+33.27+29.85+30.60+33.01) = 234.08 /7 = 33.44\n\n    Hour 9: [33.80, 31.81, 41.29, 33.30, 30.41, 30.84, 32.81] -> \n        = (33.80+31.81+41.29+33.30+30.41+30.84+32.81) = 234.26 /7 = 33.47\n\n    Hour 10: [33.24, 31.95, 42.26, 33.39, 30.77, 31.18, 32.71] -> \n        = (33.24+31.95+42.26+33.39+30.77+31.18+32.71) = 235.5 /7 = 33.64\n\n    Hour 11: [32.78, 32.16, 42.96, 32.98, 30.94, 30.91, 32.19] -> \n        = (32.78+32.16+42.96+32.98+30.94+30.91+32.19) = 234.92 /7 = 33.56\n\n    Hour 12: [32.58, 32.05, 42.37, 32.77, 30.86, 30.89, 31.96] -> \n        = (32.58+32.05+42.37+32.77+30.86+30.89+31.96) = 233.48 /7 = 33.35\n\n    Hour 13: [32.20, 32.08, 42.83, 32.61, 30.80, 30.79, 31.78] -> \n        = (32.20+32.08+42.83+32.61+30.80+30.79+31.78) = 233.09 /7 = 33.30\n\n    Hour 14: [32.12, 32.49, 43.08, 32.39, 30.98, 30.75, 31.61] -> \n        = (32.12+32.49+43.08+32.39+30.98+30.75+31.61) = 233.42 /7 = 33.35\n\n    Hour 15: [32.10, 33.32, 44.93, 32.58, 31.56, 30.85, 31.91] -> \n        = (32.10+33.32+44.93+32.58+31.56+30.85+31.91) = 237.25 /7 = 33.89\n\n    Hour 16: [32.31, 34.10, 50.64, 32.76, 32.54, 31.16, 32.03] -> \n        = (32.31+34.10+50.64+32.76+32.54+31.16+32.03) = 245.54 /7 = 35.08\n\n    Hour 17: [32.18, 34.50, 50.41, 32.76, 32.92, 31.38, 31.95] -> \n        = (32.18+34.50+50.41+32.76+32.92+31.38+31.95) = 246.1 /7 = 35.16\n\n    Hour 18: [31.87, 33.80, 48.11, 32.33, 32.60, 31.11, 31.47] -> \n        = (31.87+33.80+48.11+32.33+32.60+31.11+31.47) = 241.29 /7 = 34.47\n\n    Hour 19: [31.29, 32.80, 45.75, 31.53, 31.97, 30.92, 30.84] -> \n        = (31.29+32.80+45.75+31.53+31.97+30.92+30.84) = 235.1 /7 = 33.59\n\n    Hour 20: [30.69, 32.11, 42.01, 30.95, 31.44, 30.69, 30.33] -> \n        = (30.69+32.11+42.01+30.95+31.44+30.69+30.33) = 228.22 /7 = 32.60\n\n    Hour 21: [30.06, 31.72, 37.84, 30.43, 31.24, 30.80, 29.97] -> \n        = (30.06+31.72+37.84+30.43+31.24+30.80+29.97) = 222.06 /7 = 31.72\n\n    Hour 22: [29.27, 31.36, 34.95, 29.78, 30.98, 30.30, 29.49] -> \n        = (29.27+31.36+34.95+29.78+30.98+30.30+29.49) = 216.13 /7 = 30.88\n\n    Hour 23: [28.30, 30.58, 33.32, 28.86, 30.50, 29.72, 28.69] -> \n        = (28.30+30.58+33.32+28.86+30.50+29.72+28.69) = 209.97 /7 = 30.00\n\n19.

We output the forecast in the required format.\n\nNote: This is a simple average method. In practice, more sophisticated models (like SARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning models) would be used, but given the constraints (only 7 days of target variable and no exogenous variables) and the requirement for a quick response, this is a reasonable approach.\n",
