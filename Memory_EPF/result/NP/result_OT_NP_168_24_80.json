        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/7/15 0:00 to 2014/7/21 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2014/7/22 0:00 to 2014/7/22 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical price.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours = 168). There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows a clear pattern: \n    - Prices are lower during the night and early morning, then rise during the day, peaking in the morning and afternoon, and then decreasing in the evening and night.\n    - Also, we can see that weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices than weekends.\n\n 3. Since we are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends. Given the short-term forecast (24 hours), we can use:\n    - Seasonal Naive: forecast each hour of the next day by taking the same hour from the previous day or the same day of the previous week.\n    - However, we note that the data from 2014/7/20 and 2014/7/21 (Sunday and Monday) show a different pattern (especially Sunday had a significant drop). Therefore, using the immediate past week might be better.\n\n 4. Considering the day of the week: \n    - The next day is 2014/7/22, which is a Tuesday. \n    - We have data for the previous Tuesday: 2014/7/15 (which was a Tuesday) and also the most recent Monday (2014/7/21) and Sunday (2014/7/20). \n\n 5. Approach: \n    We can use a seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 24 hours (daily) but adjusted for the weekly pattern. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2014/7/15) as a base, but also consider the recent trend.\n\n    However, note that the data from 2014/7/21 (Monday) is available and the pattern of the week might be similar. But we see that the Monday (2014/7/21) had a different pattern than the previous Monday (2014/7/14, which is not provided). \n\n    Alternatively, we can use the average of the last two days (Monday and Sunday) to adjust, but that might not be accurate.\n\n 6. Given the simplicity and the requirement for a quick forecast, we can use the following:\n     - Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday, 2014/7/15) as the forecast for the next day (2014/7/22) but adjust by the recent day-over-day change.\n\n     However, we note that the week starting from Sunday (2014/7/20) had a drop in prices, and Monday (2014/7/21) recovered but not to the level of the previous week.\n\n 7. Another idea: use the average of the last 7 days for each hour to account for daily seasonality and smooth out noise. But this might not capture the weekly pattern (weekend vs weekday).\n\n 8. Considering the above, we can do:\n     - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) of the previous week? But we don't have data for the week before 2014/7/15.\n\n 9. Since we only have one week of data, we can use:\n     - The same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2014/7/21) for forecasting Tuesday? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2014/7/15) and adjust it by the change observed in the most recent day (Monday, 2014/7/21) relative to the same day a week ago (Monday, 2014/7/14). However, we don't have data for 2014/7/14.\n\n 11. Therefore, we must rely on the data we have. Let's note the last two days (Sunday and Monday) are available and the same days of the previous week (Sunday 2014/7/13 and Monday 2014/7/14) are not available.\n\n 12. Given the constraints, a simple method is to use the previous day (Monday, 2014/7/21) as the forecast for the next day (Tuesday, 2014/7/22). But we note that weekdays typically have similar patterns, and Tuesday might be similar to Monday? However, looking at the data, the previous week (Tuesday 2014/7/15) had higher prices than Monday 2014/7/14 (which we don't have) but we do see that the Monday we have (2014/7/21) had a pattern that is similar to the previous Tuesday? \n\n 13. We can also use a moving average of the last few days for the same hour.\n\n 14. Let's try to compute the average of the same hour for the last 3 days (Sunday, Monday, and the previous Tuesday is too far?).\n\n     But we have 7 days of data. We can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? That would include two weekend days and five weekdays? Not ideal.\n\n 15. Considering the day of the week, we can use:\n      - For the forecast of Tuesday, we use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2014/7/15) and the same hour from the previous Monday (2014/7/21) and take a weighted average? \n\n 16. Since we don't have a model and we are to provide a forecast, we choose a simple method: \n      - Use the same hour from the previous week (Tuesday, 2014/7/15) and adjust it by the ratio of the most recent Monday (2014/7/21) to the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week.\n\n 17. Therefore, we use the seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 1 week. That is, the forecast for 2014/7/22 0:00 is the same as 2014/7/15 0:00, and so on.\n\n     But note: the previous Tuesday was 2014/7/15, and we have that data.\n\n     However, we see that the overall level of prices in the most recent days (Sunday and Monday) is lower than the same days in the previous week? We don't have the same days of the previous week to compare.\n\n 18. Since we don't have the data for the same days of the previous week (Sunday and Monday) to adjust, we will use the seasonal naive with a seasonality of 1 week.\n\n     Forecast for 2014/7/22 0:00 = 27.33 (from 2014/7/15 0:00)\n     ... until\n     Forecast for 2014/7/22 23:00 = 28.94 (from 2014/7/15 23:00)\n\n     But wait, the data for 2014/7/15 was a Tuesday and 2014/7/22 is also a Tuesday. However, we note that the recent trend shows a drop in prices (especially on Sunday and Monday). Therefore, we might adjust by a drift.\n\n 19. We can compute the average change in the level of prices from the previous week to the current week for the days we have. But we only have the current week starting from Sunday and Monday? and the previous week we have Tuesday to Monday? Actually, we have the previous week from Tuesday (2014/7/15) to Monday (2014/7/21) is the current week? \n\n     Actually, the data provided is from 2014/7/15 (Tuesday) to 2014/7/21 (Monday). So we have 7 days: \n        Day1: Tue (2014/7/15)\n        Day2: Wed (2014/7/16)\n        Day3: Thu (2014/7/17)\n        Day4: Fri (2014/7/18)\n        Day5: Sat (2014/7/19) -> note: Saturday pattern is different (lower during the day, then a peak in the evening)\n        Day6: Sun (2014/7/20) -> very low prices\n        Day7: Mon (2014/7/21) -> recovered but not as high as the previous Monday? (we don't have the previous Monday)\n\n 20. We can compute the average price for the entire week (7 days) and compare to the average of the previous week? But we don't have the week before 2014/7/15.\n\n 21. Given the lack of data for the previous week (only starting from Tuesday), we cannot compute a week-over-week change.\n\n 22. Therefore, we will use the seasonal naive method with a seasonality of 1 week, but we adjust by the overall trend we observe in the last 7 days? \n\n     We can compute the linear trend over the 168 hours and adjust the seasonal naive forecast by that trend? But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 23. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) for the same hour and compare to the same 3 days in the previous week? But we don't have the previous Saturday and Sunday.\n\n 24. Due to the constraints, we must provide a forecast. We decide to use the seasonal naive with a seasonality of 1 week (using the same day of the previous week) and then adjust by the difference between the most recent day (Monday, 2014/7/21) and the same day of the previous week (Monday, 2014/7/14) which we don't have. So we cannot do that.\n\n 25. We decide to use the previous week's Tuesday (2014/7/15) as the forecast for the coming Tuesday (2014/7/22) without adjustment.\n\n 26. But note: the data on 2014/7/21 (Monday) had an average price that we can compare to the previous Monday? That doesn't exist in our data.\n\n 27. Another idea: use the average of the last 7 days for the same hour. This will capture the daily seasonality and smooth over the week. Let's do that.\n\n     For hour 0:00, average of the 7 days: \n        2014/7/15 0:00: 27.33\n        2014/7/16 0:00: 27.27\n        2014/7/17 0:00: 27.24\n        2014/7/18 0:00: 27.22\n        2014/7/19 0:00: 27.96\n        2014/7/20 0:00: 25.68\n        2014/7/21 0:00: 25.17\n\n        Average = (27.33+27.27+27.24+27.22+27.96+25.68+25.17)/7 = 26.838...\n\n     Similarly for each hour.\n\n 28. This method will give a forecast that is an average of the same hour over the last 7 days. It will smooth out the weekly pattern and also include weekend effects. However, for a Tuesday, it might be influenced by the weekend days? \n\n 29. We can also that the last two days (Sunday and Monday) had lower prices, so the forecast for Tuesday might be lower than the previous Tuesday.\n\n 30. Given the above, we choose the 7-day moving average by hour.\n\n Steps for the forecast:\n   For each hour H in [0, 23]:\n        forecast_H = average of the price at hour H for the days 2014/7/15, 2014/7/16, 2014/7/17, 2014/7/18, 2014/7/19, 2014/7/20, 2014/7/21\n\n 31. We compute the average for each hour:\n\n   Hour 0: (27.33 + 27.27 + 27.24 + 27.22 + 27.96 + 25.68 + 25.17) / 7 = 26.83857\n   Hour 1: (26.10 + 26.45 + 26.73 + 26.78 + 27.23 + 23.96 + 24.21) / 7 = 25.92286\n   ... and so on.\n\n 32. However, note that the data for 2014/7/19 (Saturday) and 2014/7/20 (Sunday) are weekends and might pull down the average for a Tuesday. But without more data, this is a simple approach.\n\n 33. Alternatively, we can use only the weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday, one Wednesday, etc. in the 7 days.\n\n 34. We decide to use the 7-day moving average to capture the overall pattern.\n\n 35. Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014/7/22 0:00 to 23:00) by taking the average of the same hour over the last 7 days.\n\n 36. We'll calculate each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: (27.33, 27.27, 27.24, 27.22, 27.96, 25.68, 25.17) -> average = 26.8386\n     Hour 1: (26.10, 26.45, 26.73, 26.78, 27.23, 23.96, 24.21) -> average = 25.9229\n     Hour 2: (25.21, 25.89, 26.68, 26.56, 27.02, 21.86, 23.53) -> average = 25.1071\n     Hour 3: (25.06, 25.61, 26.52, 26.32, 26.71, 20.70, 23.63) -> average = 24.9350\n     Hour 4: (25.23, 25.48, 26.48, 26.28, 26.59, 19.40, 23.61) -> average = 24.7243\n     Hour 5: (26.74, 26.38, 26.98, 26.81, 26.23, 16.88, 25.42) -> average = 25.0629\n     Hour 6: (27.76, 28.41, 28.49, 28.14, 27.16, 18.12, 28.26) -> average = 26.9057\n     Hour 7: (29.45, 29.53, 29.54, 29.29, 27.54, 20.89, 28.79) -> average = 27.8614\n     Hour 8: (30.10, 30.41, 30.34, 30.18, 27.94, 23.94, 29.82) -> average = 28.9614\n     Hour 9: (30.51, 30.63, 30.66, 30.58, 28.08, 25.99, 30.17) -> average = 29.5171\n     Hour 10: (30.72, 30.89, 30.94, 30.80, 27.98, 26.55, 30.34) -> average = 29.7457\n     Hour 11: (30.69, 31.03, 31.02, 30.76, 27.67, 26.78, 30.25) -> average = 29.7429\n     Hour 12: (30.67, 31.22, 30.96, 30.39, 27.34, 26.56, 30.30) -> average = 29.6343\n     Hour 13: (30.50, 30.93, 30.96, 30.18, 27.18, 26.29, 30.24) -> average = 29.4686\n     Hour 14: (30.26, 30.77, 30.84, 30.16, 27.04, 26.21, 30.23) -> average = 29.2157\n     Hour 15: (29.78, 30.52, 30.56, 29.99, 27.09, 25.98, 29.99) -> average = 29.1300\n     Hour 16: (29.76, 30.64, 30.64, 30.06, 27.09, 25.56, 29.69) -> average = 29.0629\n     Hour 17: (30.44, 30.63, 30.56, 29.92, 27.66, 27.14, 29.77) -> average = 29.4457\n     Hour 18: (29.74, 30.49, 30.48, 29.73, 28.94, 28.01, 29.44) -> average = 29.5471\n     Hour 19: (29.77, 30.42, 30.41, 29.57, 29.35, 28.45, 29.28) -> average = 29.6071\n     Hour 20: (29.36, 30.21, 29.55, 29.20, 28.98, 28.50, 28.91) -> average = 29.2443\n     Hour 21: (29.61, 30.06, 29.42, 28.91, 28.57, 27.99, 28.85) -> average = 29.0586\n     Hour 22: (29.41, 29.94, 29.15, 28.88, 28.75, 28.34, 28.36) -> average = 29.1186\n     Hour 23: (28.94, 29.45, 28.09, 27.89, 27.63, 27.01, 26.99) -> average = 28.1429\n\n 37. We note that the average for hour 0 is 26.8386, so we round to two decimals as in the input.\n\n 38. However, we must consider that the recent trend might be downward. But without more data, we use this.\n\n 39. Therefore, the forecast for 2014/7/22:\n\n        0:00: 26.84\n        1:00: 25.92\n        2:00: 25.11\n        3:00: 24.94\n        4:00: 24.72\n        5:00: 25.06\n        6:00: 26.91\n        7:00: 27.86\n        8:00: 28.96\n        9:00: 29.52\n        10:00: 29.75\n        11:00: 29.74\n        12:00: 29.63\n        13:00: 29.47\n        14:00: 29.22\n        15:00: 29.13\n        16:00: 29.06\n        17:00: 29.45\n        18:00: 29.55\n        19:00: 29.61\n        20:00: 29.24\n        21:00: 29.06\n        22:00: 29.12\n        23:00: 28.14\n\n 40. But note: the input data has two decimal places, so we round to two decimals.\n\n 41. However, we must check if there is a better method. The 7-day average might be the best given the data.\n\n 42. We output the forecast accordingly.\n\n 43. Format: We output the date and time for the next 24 hours starting from 2014/7/22 0:00 to 2014/7/22 23:00, with the forecasted price.\n\n 44. We write the answer in the required format.\n",
