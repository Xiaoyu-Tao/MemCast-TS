        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/4/5 0:00 to 2016/4/11 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2016/4/12 0:00 to 2016/4/12 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Since we don't have the other variables, we must rely solely on the historical price data.\n\n Approach:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, there are 168 records (7 days * 24 hours). We have data for every hour, so no missing values in the provided history.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Since we don't have exogenous variables, we can use a time series model that captures the historical patterns. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours).\n\n 3. We can use a model like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) or a simple moving average, but without the exogenous variables, we must rely on the pattern of the price.\n\n 4. Observing the data: \n    - The prices show a clear daily pattern: lower during the night and early morning, then rising in the morning, peaking in the late morning or early afternoon, and then decreasing in the evening and night.\n    - The weekdays (Monday to Friday) might have higher prices than the weekend.\n\n 5. The last day in the data is 2016/4/11 (Monday). The next 24 hours are 2016/4/12 (Tuesday). We can expect a pattern similar to the previous Tuesday (2016/4/5) but adjusted for the recent trend.\n\n 6. However, note that the data on 2016/4/11 (Monday) had a spike in the morning (7:00: 27.94, 8:00: 34.50) which is unusual compared to the previous days. This might be an outlier or a special event. We must be cautious.\n\n 7. Since we are not provided with the other variables, we can use a simple method such as:\n    - Using the average of the same hour of the previous days (e.g., average of the last 7 days at 0:00 for the next 0:00) but adjusted for the day of the week.\n\n 8. Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2016/4/5, which was a Tuesday) as the forecast for 2016/4/12 (also a Tuesday). But note that 2016/4/5 was the first day in our data and the prices on 2016/4/11 were higher.\n\n 9. Considering the limitations, we can use a weighted average of the last few days and the same day last week.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the average of the last 3 days (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday of the previous week) for the same hour? But note: \n     - 2016/4/5 (Tuesday), 2016/4/6 (Wednesday), ... until 2016/4/11 (Monday). \n     - The next day is Tuesday, so we can take the average of the two most recent Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday (2016/4/5) in the data.\n\n 11. Given the complexity and without a model, we can use a simple approach: \n     - For each hour, take the average of the same hour over the last 7 days (if we believe in weekly seasonality) and then adjust by the recent trend.\n\n 12. However, the spike on 2016/4/11 might distort the average. We might consider using the median to avoid the effect of outliers.\n\n 13. Steps for each hour (0:00 to 23:00) of the next day (2016/4/12):\n     - Collect the 7 values for that hour from the last 7 days (2016/4/5 to 2016/4/11).\n     - Compute the median (to avoid the spike on 2016/4/11) or a trimmed mean? But note: the spike was only in the morning of 2016/4/11, so for other hours the median might be the same as the mean.\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use the last available day (2016/4/11) as the primary pattern and adjust it by the average change from the previous week's Tuesday to the current week's Monday? This might be too complex.\n\n 15. Given the time and simplicity, we will use the median of the same hour over the last 7 days for each hour.\n\n 16. Let's calculate for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0:00: [20.31 (4/5), 19.76 (4/6), 17.45 (4/7), 19.55 (4/8), 21.02 (4/9), 20.79 (4/10), 20.02 (4/11)] \n        Sort: 17.45, 19.55, 19.76, 20.02, 20.31, 20.79, 21.02 -> median = 20.02\n\n     But note: 4/11 (Monday) at 0:00 was 20.02, and 4/5 (Tuesday) was 20.31. The median is 20.02.\n\n     Actually, the median for an odd number of observations is the middle one. The sorted list has 7 values, the 4th is 20.02.\n\n     Let me recalc: \n        positions: \n          1: 17.45\n          2: 19.55\n          3: 19.76\n          4: 20.02  -> median\n          5: 20.31\n          6: 20.79\n          7: 21.02\n\n     So for 0:00: 20.02\n\n     However, we note that the prices on 4/11 were generally higher than the previous days, so the median might be lower than the last day. But without the exogenous variables, we stick to the median.\n\n 17. But wait, the spike on 4/11 was at 7:00 and 8:00. For other hours, the median might be reasonable.\n\n 18. For 7:00: \n        Values: \n          4/5: 25.20\n          4/6: 22.83\n          4/7: 21.59\n          4/8: 22.69\n          4/9: 21.19\n          4/10: 19.66\n          4/11: 27.94   -> this is the spike\n\n        Sorted: 19.66, 21.19, 21.59, 22.69, 22.83, 25.20, 27.94 -> median = 22.69\n\n     This avoids the spike and the very low value of 4/10.\n\n 19. Similarly, for 8:00:\n        Values: \n          4/5: 26.42\n          4/6: 23.55\n          4/7: 21.92\n          4/8: 23.96\n          4/9: 21.83\n          4/10: 20.20\n          4/11: 34.50\n\n        Sorted: 20.20, 21.83, 21.92, 23.55, 23.96, 26.42, 34.50 -> median = 23.55\n\n 20. This method seems to avoid the extreme values.\n\n 21. Therefore, we will compute the median for each hour of the day (0 to 23) using the last 7 days.\n\n 22. We note that the data provided is exactly 7 days (168 hours) so we have 7 values for each hour.\n\n 23. Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n     Hour 0: [20.31, 19.76, 17.45, 19.55, 21.02, 20.79, 20.02] -> sorted: [17.45, 19.55, 19.76, 20.02, 20.31, 20.79, 21.02] -> median = 20.02\n     Hour 1: [20.04, 19.20, 16.66, 19.29, 20.60, 20.17, 19.40] -> sorted: [16.66, 19.20, 19.29, 19.40, 20.04, 20.17, 20.60] -> median = 19.40\n     Hour 2: [20.03, 19.06, 16.49, 19.24, 20.53, 19.73, 19.33] -> sorted: [16.49, 19.06, 19.24, 19.33, 19.73, 20.03, 20.53] -> median = 19.33\n     Hour 3: [19.81, 18.95, 15.95, 19.30, 20.57, 19.59, 19.54] -> sorted: [15.95, 18.95, 19.30, 19.54, 19.59, 19.81, 20.57] -> median = 19.54\n     Hour 4: [20.08, 19.02, 16.93, 19.64, 20.56, 19.60, 20.27] -> sorted: [16.93, 19.02, 19.60, 19.64, 20.08, 20.27, 20.56] -> median = 19.64\n     Hour 5: [21.14, 20.05, 18.91, 20.36, 20.79, 19.50, 21.33] -> sorted: [18.91, 19.50, 20.05, 20.36, 20.79, 21.14, 21.33] -> median = 20.36\n     Hour 6: [22.71, 21.52, 20.79, 21.51, 21.13, 19.55, 22.63] -> sorted: [19.55, 20.79, 21.13, 21.51, 21.52, 22.63, 22.71] -> median = 21.51\n     Hour 7: [25.20, 22.83, 21.59, 22.69, 21.19, 19.66, 27.94] -> sorted: [19.66, 21.19, 21.59, 22.69, 22.83, 25.20, 27.94] -> median = 22.69\n     Hour 8: [26.42, 23.55, 21.92, 23.96, 21.83, 20.20, 34.50] -> sorted: [20.20, 21.83, 21.92, 23.55, 23.96, 26.42, 34.50] -> median = 23.55\n     Hour 9: [26.41, 22.95, 21.83, 23.93, 22.25, 20.79, 29.33] -> sorted: [20.79, 21.83, 22.25, 22.95, 23.93, 26.41, 29.33] -> median = 22.95\n     Hour 10: [26.25, 22.71, 21.53, 23.45, 22.15, 20.89, 25.93] -> sorted: [20.89, 21.53, 22.15, 22.71, 23.45, 25.93, 26.25] -> median = 22.71\n     Hour 11: [24.33, 22.00, 21.43, 22.90, 21.99, 20.89, 23.52] -> sorted: [20.89, 21.43, 21.99, 22.00, 22.90, 23.52, 24.33] -> median = 22.00\n     Hour 12: [23.33, 21.39, 21.35, 22.75, 21.41, 20.27, 22.73] -> sorted: [20.27, 21.35, 21.39, 21.41, 22.73, 22.75, 23.33] -> median = 21.41\n     Hour 13: [22.94, 21.11, 21.34, 22.50, 20.56, 20.11, 22.48] -> sorted: [20.11, 20.56, 21.11, 21.34, 22.48, 22.50, 22.94] -> median = 21.34\n     Hour 14: [22.83, 21.08, 21.21, 22.12, 20.15, 20.02, 22.21] -> sorted: [20.02, 20.15, 21.08, 21.21, 22.12, 22.21, 22.83] -> median = 21.21\n     Hour 15: [22.60, 20.56, 20.90, 21.49, 20.24, 20.06, 21.75] -> sorted: [20.06, 20.24, 20.56, 20.90, 21.49, 21.75, 22.60] -> median = 20.90\n     Hour 16: [22.54, 20.88, 21.07, 21.62, 20.50, 20.40, 22.15] -> sorted: [20.40, 20.50, 20.88, 21.07, 21.62, 22.15, 22.54] -> median = 21.07\n     Hour 17: [22.82, 21.26, 21.25, 21.75, 21.43, 20.64, 22.40] -> sorted: [20.64, 21.25, 21.26, 21.43, 21.75, 22.40, 22.82] -> median = 21.43\n     Hour 18: [22.81, 21.69, 21.52, 22.14, 22.30, 21.07, 22.47] -> sorted: [21.07, 21.52, 21.69, 22.14, 22.30, 22.47, 22.81] -> median = 22.14\n     Hour 19: [23.19, 21.98, 21.87, 22.19, 22.26, 21.80, 22.59] -> sorted: [21.80, 21.87, 21.98, 22.19, 22.26, 22.59, 23.19] -> median = 22.19\n     Hour 20: [22.95, 21.84, 21.65, 21.79, 22.14, 21.84, 22.55] -> sorted: [21.65, 21.79, 21.84, 21.84, 22.14, 22.55, 22.95] -> median = 21.84\n     Hour 21: [22.69, 21.30, 21.35, 21.79, 21.89, 21.76, 22.28] -> sorted: [21.30, 21.35, 21.76, 21.79, 21.89, 22.28, 22.69] -> median = 21.79\n     Hour 22: [21.96, 20.09, 20.82, 21.22, 21.40, 21.14, 21.63] -> sorted: [20.09, 20.82, 21.14, 21.22, 21.40, 21.63, 21.96] -> median = 21.22\n     Hour 23: [21.05, 18.99, 19.95, 20.77, 21.06, 20.04, 21.05] -> sorted: [18.99, 19.95, 20.04, 20.77, 21.05, 21.05, 21.06] -> median = 20.77\n\n 24.
