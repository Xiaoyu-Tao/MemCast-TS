        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014-11-04 00:00 to 2014-11-10 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014-11-11 00:00 to 2014-11-11 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points, 24*7=168). So no missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the historical prices (OT) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are only given the price, we can use a univariate time series model. Given the daily seasonality (24 hours) and the weekly pattern (we see weekdays vs weekend), we can use a model that captures:\n   - Trend (if any, but the data is only one week so trend might be minimal)\n   - Seasonality (daily and weekly)\n\n However, note that the data provided is only one week (7 days). We have:\n   - 4 weekdays (Tuesday 4th, Wednesday 5th, Thursday 6th, Friday 7th) and then the weekend (Saturday 8th, Sunday 9th, Monday 10th).\n\n We are to forecast the next day: Tuesday 11th November 2014.\n\n Since we have only one week of data, we can consider:\n   - Using the same day of the week (i.e., previous Tuesday, which is 2014-11-04) as a base, but adjusted by the recent trend? \n   - Alternatively, we can use a simple average of the same hour of the previous days, but we have only one Tuesday and then the weekend which has a different pattern.\n\n Given the complexity and the limited data, a simple approach is to use the average of the same hour from the previous weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) for the forecast of Tuesday (a weekday). However, note that the weekend (Saturday, Sunday) and Monday are different.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But since we have a clear daily cycle, we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the available weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and then adjust by the overall level of the last day (Monday) relative to the previous days.\n\n However, note that the last day (Monday 10th) is a weekday and the day we are forecasting (Tuesday 11th) is also a weekday. We can also consider the pattern of the previous day (Monday) and the same day last week (Tuesday).\n\n Let's look at the data:\n\n We have 7 days. We can break down by day:\n\n Day 1: Tuesday (2014-11-04)\n Day 2: Wednesday (2014-11-05)\n Day 3: Thursday (2014-11-06)\n Day 4: Friday (2014-11-07)\n Day 5: Saturday (2014-11-08)\n Day 6: Sunday (2014-11-09)\n Day 7: Monday (2014-11-10)\n\n We are to forecast Day 8: Tuesday (2014-11-11)\n\n Since the pattern on weekdays is similar and weekends are different, we can use the average of the four weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) for each hour, but then adjust by the level of the most recent day (Monday) relative to the average of the previous weekdays? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a naive method: use the same day last week (Tuesday 4th) as the forecast. But we see that the prices on Monday 10th are higher than the previous Monday? Actually, we don't have the previous Monday. We have only one week.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) to forecast the coming Tuesday. But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Given the data, a simple and robust method is to use the average of the same hour over the available weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and then adjust by the ratio of the last day (Monday) to the average of the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last four weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) without adjustment.\n\n However, let's check the overall level of the weekdays:\n\n We can compute the average price for each day:\n\n Tuesday (4th): average = (10.01+7.90+...+25.18)/24 -> let's compute quickly:\n\n We can calculate the daily averages:\n\n Tuesday 4th: \n   Sum = 10.01+7.90+9.97+12.99+15.98+22.56+28.99+30.95+31.10+30.38+30.05+30.27+30.11+30.75+30.71+31.19+31.74+32.27+32.18+31.79+31.09+30.34+28.66+25.18\n   = 625.61\n   Average = 625.61 / 24 = 26.067\n\n Wednesday 5th: \n   Sum = 26.05+25.30+25.08+25.03+25.27+27.82+31.30+32.78+33.10+32.61+32.09+31.85+31.94+31.86+32.25+32.21+32.98+33.59+32.85+31.59+30.63+29.81+28.19+24.48\n   = 679.59\n   Average = 679.59 / 24 = 28.316\n\n Thursday 6th:\n   Sum = 25.58+24.93+25.04+25.54+25.91+27.50+31.17+32.50+33.36+33.06+32.64+32.40+32.27+32.10+32.33+32.79+33.99+37.43+37.42+32.93+32.11+31.74+30.78+28.43\n   = 707.95\n   Average = 707.95 / 24 = 29.498\n\n Friday 7th:\n   Sum = 27.67+26.41+25.84+25.81+26.00+27.73+31.78+34.76+35.24+35.11+33.56+32.80+32.08+31.85+31.91+31.98+32.60+33.27+32.62+31.56+30.13+28.96+27.88+25.82\n   = 700.17\n   Average = 700.17 / 24 = 29.174\n\n Saturday 8th:\n   Sum = 24.88+24.43+24.35+24.15+24.26+24.54+25.41+26.22+26.81+27.82+28.14+27.77+27.51+27.07+27.91+29.88+31.10+32.01+31.68+30.67+28.88+27.88+27.01+25.64\n   = 650.31\n   Average = 650.31 / 24 = 27.096\n\n Sunday 9th:\n   Sum = 24.42+23.65+22.72+22.88+22.84+23.19+23.61+23.70+23.94+24.78+25.19+25.60+25.46+25.73+25.77+26.62+28.98+30.45+30.09+29.38+28.41+27.57+26.89+25.37\n   = 602.44\n   Average = 602.44 / 24 = 25.102\n\n Monday 10th:\n   Sum = 25.21+24.72+24.91+24.49+24.76+26.27+29.91+31.64+31.73+31.68+31.49+31.42+31.26+31.32+31.52+31.70+32.11+32.74+31.93+31.23+30.14+29.42+28.17+26.30\n   = 692.15\n   Average = 692.15 / 24 = 28.840\n\n We see that the weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) have averages: 26.067, 28.316, 29.498, 29.174 -> average of these four: (26.067+28.316+29.498+29.174)/4 = 28.26375\n\n The Monday (10th) is 28.840, which is slightly above the average of the previous weekdays.\n\n Now, for the forecast day (Tuesday 11th) we can assume it will be around the average of the previous weekdays (28.26375) or slightly above? \n\n However, we can do a more granular approach:\n\n For each hour (0 to 23), we compute the average of that hour over the four weekdays (Tue 4th, Wed 5th, Thu 6th, Fri 7th). Then, we can adjust by the ratio of the last day (Monday 10th) to the average of the same hour on the previous weekdays? But note: Monday is a different day of the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour on the four weekdays as the base forecast for Tuesday, and then adjust by the overall trend observed from Monday? \n\n However, without more data, we can simply use the average of the same hour over the four weekdays.\n\n But note: the data shows that the prices on the last two weekdays (Thursday and Friday) are higher than Tuesday and Wednesday. So we might give more weight to the recent weekdays? \n\n Since we are limited, we can use a simple average.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: (10.01 + 26.05 + 25.58 + 27.67) / 4 = (10.01+26.05=36.06; 36.06+25.58=61.64; 61.64+27.67=89.31) -> 89.31/4 = 22.3275\n Hour 1: (7.90 + 25.30 + 24.93 + 26.41) / 4 = (7.90+25.30=33.20; 33.20+24.93=58.13; 58.13+26.41=84.54) -> 84.54/4 = 21.135\n ... and so on.\n\n However, we see that the first Tuesday (4th) at hour0 was 10.01, which is much lower than the other days. This might be an outlier? Or because it was the start of the week? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the median to avoid the outlier? But the problem says to handle missing values, but we don't have missing values. However, the first Tuesday might be an anomaly.\n\n Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday, we might rely more on the previous Tuesday? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Another approach: use the average of the same hour over the last three days (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) but with weights: more weight to the same day of the week and the most recent days.\n\n We can try a weighted average: \n   weight for the same day last week (Tuesday 4th): 0.4\n   weight for the next days: 0.2 for Wednesday, 0.2 for Thursday, 0.2 for Friday? \n\n But then the weights would be: 0.4 (for the same day last week) and 0.6 for the rest? Actually, we have four days. We can do:\n\n   Tuesday_forecast(h) = 0.4 * Tuesday_4th(h) + 0.2 * Wednesday_5th(h) + 0.2 * Thursday_6th(h) + 0.2 * Friday_7th(h)\n\n This gives more weight to the same day of the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the four weekdays without weights.\n\n Given the time, I will use the simple average of the four weekdays for each hour.\n\n Let's compute the average for each hour (0 to 23) from the four weekdays (2014-11-04, 2014-11-05, 2014-11-06, 2014-11-07):\n\n Hour 0: (10.01 + 26.05 + 25.58 + 27.67) / 4 = 89.31 / 4 = 22.3275\n Hour 1: (7.90 + 25.30 + 24.93 + 26.41) / 4 = 84.54 / 4 = 21.135\n Hour 2: (9.97 + 25.08 + 25.04 + 25.84) / 4 = 85.93 / 4 = 21.4825\n Hour 3: (12.99 + 25.03 + 25.54 + 25.81) / 4 = 89.37 / 4 = 22.3425\n Hour 4: (15.98 + 25.27 + 25.91 + 26.00) / 4 = 93.16 / 4 = 23.29\n Hour 5: (22.56 + 27.82 + 27.50 + 27.73) / 4 = 105.61 / 4 = 26.4025\n Hour 6: (28.99 + 31.30 + 31.17 + 31.78) / 4 = 123.24 / 4 = 30.81\n Hour 7: (30.95 + 32.78 + 32.50 + 34.76) / 4 = 130.99 / 4 = 32.7475\n Hour 8: (31.10 + 33.10 + 33.36 + 35.24) / 4 = 132.80 / 4 = 33.20\n Hour 9: (30.38 + 32.61 + 33.06 + 35.11) / 4 = 131.16 / 4 = 32.79\n Hour 10: (30.05 + 32.09 + 32.64 + 33.56) / 4 = 128.34 / 4 = 32.085\n Hour 11: (30.27 + 31.85 + 32.40 + 32.80) / 4 = 127.32 / 4 = 31.83\n Hour 12: (30.11 + 31.94 + 32.27 + 32.08) / 4 = 126.40 / 4 = 31.60\n Hour 13: (30.75 + 31.86 + 32.10 + 31.85) / 4 = 126.56 / 4 = 31.64\n Hour 14: (30.71 + 32.25 + 32.33 + 31.91) / 4 = 127.20 / 4 = 31.80\n Hour 15: (31.19 + 32.21 + 32.79 + 31.98) / 4 = 128.17 / 4 = 32.0425\n Hour 16: (31.74 + 32.98 + 33.99 + 32.60) / 4 = 131.31 / 4 = 32.8275\n Hour 17: (32.27 + 33.59 + 37.43 + 33.27) / 4 = 136.56 / 4 = 34.14\n Hour 18: (32.18 + 32.85 + 37.42 + 32.62) / 4 = 135.07 / 4 = 33.7675\n Hour 19: (31.79 + 31.59 + 32.93 + 31.56) / 4 = 127.87 / 4 = 31.9675\n Hour 20: (31.09 + 30.63 + 32.11 + 30.13) / 4 = 123.96 / 4 = 30.99\n Hour 21: (30.34 + 29.81 + 31.74 + 28.96) / 4 = 120.85 / 4 = 30.2125\n Hour 22: (28.66 + 28.19 + 30.78 + 27.88) / 4 = 115.51 / 4 = 28.8775\n Hour 23: (25.18 + 24.48 + 28.43 + 25.82) / 4 = 103.91 / 4 = 25.9775\n\n But note: the first Tuesday (4th) has very low price at the first few hours, which might be because it was the beginning of the week? The following Tuesday (11th) might be more similar to the recent Monday? \n\n However, we don't have a strong reason to adjust. We'll use these averages.\n\n But let's compare with the last day (Monday 10th) at each hour:\n\n Monday 10th:\n   Hour0: 25.21, our forecast for Tuesday 11th hour0: 22.33 -> but Monday was 25.21, so maybe we should adjust?\n\n We can adjust by the ratio: \n   forecast = (average of weekdays for hour i) * (Monday 10th_hour_i / average of weekdays for hour_i for the same days that Monday 10th would have? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can adjust the entire Tuesday forecast by the ratio of the overall level to the average of the weekdays? \n\n Overall average of the four weekdays: 28.26375\n The Monday 10th average: 28.840\n\n So adjustment factor = 28.840 / 28.26375 = 1.0204\n\n Then we can multiply each hour of the average we computed by 1.0204.\n\n But note: the pattern of Monday might be different from Tuesday? \n\n Without more data, we can try this multiplicative adjustment.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the average without adjustment.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the method, and we are to provide a forecast, I will use the simple average of the four weekdays without adjustment.\n\n However, note that the first Tuesday (4th) had a low value at the beginning, which might be an anomaly. We might consider using the median for each hour? \n\n Let's compute the median for each hour:\n\n Hour0: [10.01, 25.58, 26.05, 27.67] -> sorted: [10.01, 25.58, 26.05, 27.67] -> median = (25.58+26.05)/2 = 25.815\n Hour1: [7.90, 24.93, 25.30, 26.41] -> sorted: [7.90, 24.93, 25.30, 26.41] -> median = (24.93+25.30)/2 = 25.115\n ... \n\n This might be better because it avoids the outlier.\n\n Given the time, I choose to use the median for each hour over the four weekdays to avoid the outlier effect.\n\n We'll compute the median for each hour:\n\n Hour0: [10.01, 25.58, 26.05, 27.67] -> median = (25.58+26.05)/2 = 25.815\n Hour1: [7.90, 24.93, 25.30, 26.41] -> median = (24.93+25.30)/2 = 25.115\n Hour2: [9.97, 25.04, 25.08, 25.84] -> sorted: [9.97, 25.04, 25.08, 25.84] -> median = (25.04+25.08)/2 = 25.06\n Hour3: [12.99, 25.03, 25.54, 25.81] -> sorted: [12.99, 25.03, 25.54, 25.81] -> median = (25.03+25.54)/2 = 25.285\n Hour4: [15.98, 25.27, 25.91, 26.00] -> sorted: [15.98, 25.27, 25.91, 26.00] -> median = (25.27+25.91)/2 = 25.59\n Hour5: [22.56, 27.50, 27.73, 27.82] -> sorted: [22.56, 27.50, 27.73, 27.82] -> median = (27.50+27.73)/2 = 27.615\n Hour6: [28.99, 31.17, 31.30, 31.78] -> median = (31.17+31.30)/2 = 31.235\n Hour7: [30.95, 32.50, 32.78, 34.76] -> median = (32.50+32.78)/2 = 32.64\n Hour8: [31.10, 33.10, 33.36, 35.24] -> median = (33.10+33.36)/2 = 33.23\n Hour9: [30.38, 32.61, 33.06, 35.11] -> median = (32.61+33.06)/2 = 32.835\n Hour10: [30.05, 32.09, 32.64, 33.56] -> median = (32.09+32.64)/2 = 32.365\n Hour11: [30.27, 31.85, 32.40, 32.80] -> median = (31.85+32.40)/2 = 32.125\n Hour12: [30.11, 31.94, 32.08, 32.27] -> median = (31.94+32.08)/2 = 32.01\n Hour13: [30.75, 31.85, 31.86, 32.10] -> sorted: [30.75, 31.85, 31.86, 32.10] -> median = (31.85+31.86)/2 = 31.855\n Hour14: [30.71, 31.91, 32.25, 32.33] -> median = (31.91+32.25)/2 = 32.08\n Hour15: [31.19, 31.98, 32.21, 32.79] -> sorted: [31.19, 31.98, 32.21, 32.79] -> median = (31.98+32.21)/2 = 32.095\n Hour16: [31.74, 32.60, 32.98, 33.99] -> median = (32.60+32.98)/2 = 32.79\n Hour17: [32.27, 33.27, 33.59, 37.43] -> median = (33.27+33.59)/2 = 33.43\n Hour18: [32.18, 32.62, 32.85, 37.42] -> sorted: [32.18, 32.62, 32.85, 37.42] -> median = (32.62+32.85)/2 = 32.735\n Hour19: [31.56, 31.59, 31.79, 32.93] -> sorted: [31.56, 31.59, 31.79, 32.93] -> median = (31.59+31.79)/2 = 31.69\n Hour20: [30.13, 30.63, 31.09, 32.11] -> median = (30.63+31.09)/2 = 30.86\n Hour21: [28.96, 29.81, 30.34, 31.74] -> sorted: [28.96, 29.81, 30.34, 31.74] -> median = (29.81+30.34)/2 = 30.075\n Hour22: [27.88, 28.19, 28.66, 30.78] -> sorted: [27.88, 28.19, 28.66, 30.78] -> median = (28.19+28.66)/2 = 28.425\n Hour23: [24.48, 25.18, 25.82, 28.43] -> sorted: [24.48, 25.18, 25.82, 28.43] -> median = (25.18+25.82)/2 = 25.50\n\n Now, we have the median for each hour.
