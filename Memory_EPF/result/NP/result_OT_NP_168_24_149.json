        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-11-10 00:00 to 2015-11-16 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-11-17 00:00 to 2015-11-17 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the historical electricity prices (OT). Therefore, we must base our forecast solely on the historical price data.\n\nGiven the nature of electricity prices (strong daily and weekly seasonality, non-linear patterns), a suitable approach is to use a time series model that captures these patterns. Since we are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables, we can use a univariate time series model.\n\nWe note that the data has:\n- Daily seasonality: 24 hours\n- Weekly seasonality: 168 hours\n\nWe can use a seasonal ARIMA model or Exponential Smoothing. However, given the multiple seasonality (daily and weekly), we might consider a model like TBATS or a seasonal decomposition followed by forecasting.\n\nBut note: we are only 168 points (7 days) of data. This is a very short history. Therefore, we must use a model that can work with limited data and capture the daily pattern.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can do the following:\n\n1. Check for missing values: The provided data does not have any missing values? We have 168 records (24*7). We have 7 full days.\n\n2. We can use a simple model that captures the daily pattern. One straightforward method is to use the average of the same hour in the previous days, but adjusted for the day of the week. However, we only have one week of data, so we cannot capture weekly seasonality beyond the same hour in the same day of the week? Actually, we have 7 days, so we can compute the average for each hour of the day over the 7 days and then adjust by the trend.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"some data may contain missing values\", but in the provided data there are none. So we don't need to impute.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a naive method: use the last week's same day and same hour. But we are forecasting a Tuesday (2015-11-17 is a Tuesday) and we have data for the previous Tuesday (2015-11-10). However, we have 7 days of data, so we can use the average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But that would ignore the trend.\n\nAnother idea: use a moving average of the same hour over the last few days, but we have only 7 days.\n\nGiven the simplicity and the data, I propose:\n\n- We compute the average of each hour of the day over the available 7 days, and then adjust by the overall trend of the last day.\n\nBut note: the last day (2015-11-16) is a Monday, and we are forecasting a Tuesday. So we can also consider the change from the previous Monday to Tuesday? But we only have one Monday and one Tuesday in the data.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following:\n\nLet the historical data for hour h (h from 0 to 23) in the past 7 days be: P_0(h), P_1(h), ... P_6(h) where P_0 is the most recent day (Monday) and P_6 is the oldest day (Tuesday of last week).\n\nWe can compute the next hour h for the next day (Tuesday) as:\n\nForecast(h) = [P_0(h) + P_1(h) + ... + P_6(h)] / 7   [simple average]\n\nBut this would be the same for every Tuesday? And we don't capture the recent trend.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to recent days. For example, exponential smoothing.\n\nBut note: we are only 7 days, so we can use a simple average and then adjust by the overall change from the previous day to the current day? \n\nAnother common method is to use the last week's same day (i.e., the Tuesday of last week) and then adjust by the percentage change of the last two days? \n\nHowever, without more data, we have to keep it simple.\n\nGiven the above, I will use:\n\n- For each hour h in [0,23]:\n    forecast(h) = (last_tuesday(h) + (average of the same hour h over the last 7 days)) / 2\n\nBut why? Because we have only one Tuesday in the data (2015-11-10) and we also have the overall average. This balances the specific day-of-week pattern and the overall average.\n\nBut note: the data shows a downward trend? Let's see the last Tuesday (2015-11-10) and the most recent day (Monday 2015-11-16) are both Mondays? Actually, we are forecasting for Tuesday 2015-11-17.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only asked for a forecast without additional data, I will use a model that uses the average of the same hour over the entire week (7 days) and then adjust by the trend of the last day relative to the average of the same day of the week.\n\nBut let me try to be more sophisticated:\n\nStep 1: Compute the average for each hour of the week (over the 7 days) -> we have 24 averages: avg_h for h=0..23.\n\nStep 2: For the last day (Monday, 2015-11-16), we have 24 actual prices: actual_mon_h for h=0..23.\n        For the previous Monday (2015-11-09) we don't have? Actually, we only have from 2015-11-10 (Tuesday) to 2015-11-16 (Monday). So we don't have the previous Monday.\n\nTherefore, we cannot compute a trend from the same day last week.\n\nAlternative: use the overall trend of the entire week? We can compute the average of the entire last day (Monday) and the average of the entire previous week? But we don't have the previous week.\n\nGiven the data limitations, I will use:\n\nMethod: \n  For hour h (0 to 23) on the forecast day (Tuesday):\n    forecast(h) = (last_tuesday(h) + avg_h) / 2\n\nBut what is last_tuesday(h)? It is the price at hour h on 2015-11-10.\n\nAnd avg_h is the average of hour h over the 7 days we have (from 2015-11-10 to 2015-11-16).\n\nBut note: the week includes different days. The 7 days are: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon.\n\nSo the average for hour h is the average of that hour across these 7 days.\n\nAlternatively, we can use only the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\nSo I will do:\n\nforecast(h) = (price_last_tuesday(h) * 0.5 + avg_h * 0.5)\n\nBut we can also consider that the most recent days are more relevant. So we can give more weight to the last few days? However, without a clear trend, we stick to the above.\n\nLet me compute the average for each hour:\n\nWe have 7 days, 24 hours. We can group by hour.\n\nFor example, for hour 0: \n  [2015-11-10 0:00: 17.41, 2015-11-11 0:00: 21.03, 2015-11-12 0:00: 21.62, 2015-11-13 0:00: 22.84, 2015-11-14 0:00: 18.46, 2015-11-15 0:00: 21.92, 2015-11-16 0:00: 23.10]\n\nSo average for hour0 = (17.41+21.03+21.62+22.84+18.46+21.92+23.10)/7 = 20.9114\n\nSimilarly, we compute for all 24 hours.\n\nThen, for the forecast for 2015-11-17 0:00, we take:\n   (last_tuesday at 0:00, which is 2015-11-10 0:00: 17.41) and the average 20.9114 -> (17.41+20.9114)/2 = 19.1607\n\nBut wait, the last Tuesday is 2015-11-10, and we are forecasting the next Tuesday 2015-11-17. However, the data shows that the prices have been increasing? So maybe we should adjust.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same day of the week (Tuesday) and the next day (Wednesday) from the previous week? But we don't have multiple Tuesdays.\n\nGiven the simplicity, I will use the above method.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should use a more sophisticated method? However, with only 7 days and no exogenous variables, we are limited.\n\nAnother idea: use a linear regression on the entire data to capture the trend and seasonality? But with 7 days, we can have 7 dummy variables for the days and 24 dummy variables for the hours? That would be too many parameters.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a moving average model with seasonality. But with only 7 days, we cannot estimate a weekly seasonality (168 hours) because we only have one cycle.\n\nTherefore, I will stick to the simple method: for each hour, the forecast is the average of the same hour over the past 7 days. Why? Because the average over the week captures the daily pattern and smooths out the day-of-week effects. But note: the average includes different days of the week. However, we don't have enough data to separate the day-of-week effect.\n\nSo let me change: I will use the simple average for each hour over the 7 days.\n\nTherefore, the forecast for hour h on 2015-11-17 is the average of the hour h for the period 2015-11-10 to 2015-11-16.\n\nBut note: the last week had a weekend (Sat, Sun) which typically have lower demand, and we are forecasting a Tuesday. So the average might be pulled down by the weekend. Therefore, we might want to use only the weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday, one Wednesday, etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the median? But again, 7 points per hour.\n\nGiven the above, I will use the average per hour over the 7 days.\n\nLet me compute the average for each hour:\n\nWe'll create a list for each hour (0 to 23) and then average the 7 values.\n\nHour 0: [17.41, 21.03, 21.62, 22.84, 18.46, 21.92, 23.10] -> average = (17.41+21.03+21.62+22.84+18.46+21.92+23.10)/7 = 146.38/7 = 20.9114\nHour 1: [16.04, 20.65, 21.23, 22.03, 16.92, 21.18, 22.39] -> (16.04+20.65+21.23+22.03+16.92+21.18+22.39) = 140.44/7 = 20.0629\nHour 2: [15.29, 20.55, 21.06, 21.80, 15.92, 20.72, 21.48] -> (15.29+20.55+21.06+21.80+15.92+20.72+21.48) = 136.82/7 = 19.5457\nHour 3: [16.12, 20.84, 21.02, 21.79, 15.89, 20.03, 20.87] -> (16.12+20.84+21.02+21.79+15.89+20.03+20.87) = 136.56/7 = 19.5086\nHour 4: [19.42, 21.41, 21.92, 22.09, 16.39, 20.15, 21.70] -> (19.42+21.41+21.92+22.09+16.39+20.15+21.70) = 143.08/7 = 20.4400\nHour 5: [21.12, 22.76, 22.58, 22.91, 18.38, 20.63, 23.23] -> (21.12+22.76+22.58+22.91+18.38+20.63+23.23) = 151.61/7 = 21.6586\nHour 6: [23.94, 23.88, 23.71, 23.77, 19.51, 21.12, 24.52] -> (23.94+23.88+23.71+23.77+19.51+21.12+24.52) = 160.45/7 = 22.9214\nHour 7: [24.99, 24.81, 24.75, 24.70, 20.55, 21.37, 25.62] -> (24.99+24.81+24.75+24.70+20.55+21.37+25.62) = 166.79/7 = 23.8271\nHour 8: [25.04, 25.97, 25.18, 24.87, 21.07, 21.64, 25.98] -> (25.04+25.97+25.18+24.87+21.07+21.64+25.98) = 169.75/7 = 24.2500\nHour 9: [24.59, 24.98, 24.49, 24.05, 21.28, 22.62, 25.19] -> (24.59+24.98+24.49+24.05+21.28+22.62+25.19) = 167.20/7 = 23.8857\nHour 10: [24.93, 26.36, 24.65, 24.13, 21.59, 23.03, 25.28] -> (24.93+26.36+24.65+24.13+21.59+23.03+25.28) = 169.97/7 = 24.2814\nHour 11: [24.56, 25.97, 24.48, 23.96, 21.51, 23.11, 24.93] -> (24.56+25.97+24.48+23.96+21.51+23.11+24.93) = 168.52/7 = 24.0743\nHour 12: [24.38, 25.02, 24.19, 23.91, 21.34, 23.16, 24.77] -> (24.38+25.02+24.19+23.91+21.34+23.16+24.77) = 166.77/7 = 23.8243\nHour 13: [24.29, 25.11, 24.41, 23.77, 21.08, 22.92, 24.45] -> (24.29+25.11+24.41+23.77+21.08+22.92+24.45) = 166.03/7 = 23.7186\nHour 14: [24.35, 25.28, 24.79, 23.79, 21.11, 23.11, 24.39] -> (24.35+25.28+24.79+23.79+21.11+23.11+24.39) = 166.82/7 = 23.8314\nHour 15: [24.53, 25.84, 25.67, 23.93, 22.66, 23.48, 24.76] -> (24.53+25.84+25.67+23.93+22.66+23.48+24.76) = 170.87/7 = 24.4100\nHour 16: [25.10, 27.00, 26.93, 24.29, 23.56, 24.06, 25.21] -> (25.10+27.00+26.93+24.29+23.56+24.06+25.21) = 176.15/7 = 25.1643\nHour 17: [26.79, 28.35, 28.56, 24.81, 23.83, 25.32, 25.66] -> (26.79+28.35+28.56+24.81+23.83+25.32+25.66) = 183.32/7 = 26.1886\nHour 18: [26.10, 27.22, 28.36, 24.46, 23.64, 24.98, 25.13] -> (26.10+27.22+28.36+24.46+23.64+24.98+25.13) = 179.89/7 = 25.6986\nHour 19: [24.45, 25.06, 26.28, 23.75, 23.21, 24.51, 24.20] -> (24.45+25.06+26.28+23.75+23.21+24.51+24.20) = 171.46/7 = 24.4943\nHour 20: [23.92, 24.19, 25.14, 23.09, 22.64, 23.95, 23.67] -> (23.92+24.19+25.14+23.09+22.64+23.95+23.67) = 166.60/7 = 23.8000\nHour 21: [23.66, 24.00, 24.67, 22.81, 22.47, 23.81, 23.43] -> (23.66+24.00+24.67+22.81+22.47+23.81+23.43) = 164.85/7 = 23.5500\nHour 22: [22.66, 23.18, 23.82, 21.50, 21.63, 23.62, 22.74] -> (22.66+23.18+23.82+21.50+21.63+23.62+22.74) = 159.15/7 = 22.7357\nHour 23: [21.34, 21.97, 23.10, 19.58, 21.49, 23.18, 21.35] -> (21.34+21.97+23.10+19.58+21.49+23.18+21.35) = 152.01/7 = 21.7157\n\nSo the forecast for 2015-11-17 (Tuesday) from 00:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n00:00: 20.91\n01:00: 20.06\n02:00: 19.55\n03:00: 19.51\n04:00: 20.44\n05:00: 21.66\n06:00: 22.92\n07:00: 23.83\n08:00: 24.25\n09:00: 23.89\n10:00: 24.28\n11:00: 24.07\n12:00: 23.82\n13:00: 23.72\n14:00: 23.83\n15:00: 24.41\n16:00: 25.16\n17:00: 26.19\n18:00: 25.70\n19:00: 24.49\n20:00: 23.80\n21:00: 23.55\n22:00: 22.74\n23:00: 21.72\n\nBut note: we are forecasting for a Tuesday, and the average includes the weekend which are lower. Therefore, we might be under-forecasting for a Tuesday? But we don't have enough data to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, we can use only the weekdays? But we have only 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days. And we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday). So we can average only the weekdays? The weekdays in the data: \n  Tuesday (2015-11-10), Wednesday (2015-11-11), Thursday (2015-11-12), Friday (2015-11-13), Monday (2015-11-16) -> 5 days\n  Weekend: Saturday (2015-11-14), Sunday (2015-11-15) -> 2 days\n\nSo for a more accurate forecast for a Tuesday, we can use the average of the same hour over the weekdays only? But note: Monday is included in the weekdays? Yes.\n\nSo let me recalc using only the 5 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon) for each hour:\n\nHour0: [17.41, 21.03, 21.62, 22.84, 23.10] -> (17.41+21.03+21.62+22.84+23.10) = 106.00/5 = 21.20\nHour1: [16.04, 20.65, 21.23, 22.03, 22.39] -> (16.04+20.65+21.23+22.03+22.39) = 102.34/5 = 20.468\nHour2: [15.29, 20.55, 21.06, 21.80, 21.48] -> (15.29+20.55+21.06+21.80+21.48) = 100.18/5 = 20.036\nHour3: [16.12, 20.84, 21.02, 21.79, 20.87] -> (16.12+20.84+21.02+21.79+20.87) = 100.64/5 = 20.128\nHour4: [19.42, 21.41, 21.92, 22.09, 21.70] -> (19.42+21.41+21.92+22.09+21.70) = 106.54/5 = 21.308\nHour5: [21.12, 22.76, 22.58, 22.91, 23.23] -> (21.12+22.76+22.58+22.91+23.23) = 112.60/5 = 22.52\nHour6: [23.94, 23.88, 23.71, 23.77, 24.52] -> (23.94+23.88+23.71+23.77+24.52) = 119.82/5 = 23.964\nHour7: [24.99, 24.81, 24.75, 24.70, 25.62] -> (24.99+24.81+24.75+24.70+25.62) = 124.87/5 = 24.974\nHour8: [25.04, 25.97, 25.18, 24.87, 25.98] -> (25.04+25.97+25.18+24.87+25.98) = 127.04/5 = 25.408\nHour9: [24.59, 24.98, 24.49, 24.05, 25.19] -> (24.59+24.98+24.49+24.05+25.19) = 123.30/5 = 24.66\nHour10: [24.93, 26.36, 24.65, 24.13, 25.28] -> (24.93+26.36+24.65+24.13+25.28) = 125.35/5 = 25.07\nHour11: [24.56, 25.97, 24.48, 23.96, 24.93] -> (24.56+25.97+24.48+23.96+24.93) = 123.90/5 = 24.78\nHour12: [24.38, 25.02, 24.19, 23.91, 24.77] -> (24.38+25.02+24.19+23.91+24.77) = 122.27/5 = 24.454\nHour13: [24.29, 25.11, 24.41, 23.77, 24.45] -> (24.29+25.11+24.41+23.77+24.45) = 122.03/5 = 24.406\nHour14: [24.35, 25.28, 24.79, 23.79, 24.39] -> (24.35+25.28+24.79+23.79+24.39) = 122.60/5 = 24.52\nHour15: [24.53, 25.84, 25.67, 23.93, 24.76] -> (24.53+25.84+25.67+23.93+24.76) = 124.73/5 = 24.946\nHour16: [25.10, 27.00, 26.93, 24.29, 25.21] -> (25.10+27.00+26.93+24.29+25.21) = 128.53/5 = 25.706\nHour17: [26.79, 28.35, 28.56, 24.81, 25.66] -> (26.79+28.35+28.56+24.81+25.66) = 134.17/5 = 26.834\nHour18: [26.10, 27.22, 28.36, 24.46, 25.13] -> (26.10+27.22+28.36+24.46+25.13) = 131.27/5 = 26.254\nHour19: [24.45, 25.06, 26.28, 23.75, 24.20] -> (24.45+25.06+26.28+23.75+24.20) = 123.74/5 = 24.748\nHour20: [23.92, 24.19, 25.14, 23.09, 23.67] -> (23.92+24.19+25.14+23.09+23.67) = 120.01/5 = 24.002\nHour21: [23.66, 24.00, 24.67, 22.81, 23.43] -> (23.66+24.00+24.67+22.81+23.43) = 118.57/5 = 23.714\nHour22: [22.66, 23.18, 23.82, 21.50, 22.74] -> (22.66+23.18+23.82+21.50+22.74) = 113.90/5 = 22.78\nHour23: [21.34, 21.97, 23.10, 19.58, 21.35] -> (21.34+21.97+23.10+19.58+21.35) = 107.34/5 = 21.468\n\nSo the forecast for Tuesday 2015-11-17 using only weekdays:\n\n00:00: 21.20\n01:00: 20.47\n02:00: 20.04\n03:00: 20.13\n04:00: 21.31\n05:00: 22.52\n06:00: 23.96\n07:00: 24.97\n08:00: 25.41\n09:00: 24.66\n10:00: 25.07\n11:00: 24.78\n12:00: 24.45\n13:00: 24.41\n14:00: 24.52\n15:00: 24.95\n16:00: 25.71\n17:00: 26.83\n18:00: 26.25\n19:00: 24.75\n20:00: 24.00\n21:00: 23.71\n22:00: 22.78\n23:00: 21.47\n\nThis might be more accurate because we are excluding the weekend.\n\nBut note: the last Tuesday (2015-11-10) had lower prices than the rest of the weekdays? So the average might be higher than the last Tuesday.\n\nWe can also consider a combination: use the average of the weekdays and then adjust by the difference between the last Tuesday and the average of the last Tuesday's weekday? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\nGiven the above, I think using the weekday average is better.\n\nTherefore, I will use the weekday average for the forecast.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are an expert and we should handle missing values, but there are none. So we are good.\n\nFinal forecast for 2015-11-17:\n\n00:00: 21.20\n01:00: 20.47\n02:00: 20.04\n03:00: 20.13\n04:00: 21.31\n05:00: 22.52\n06:00: 23.96\n07:00: 24.97\n08:00: 25.41\n09:00: 24.66\n10:00: 25.07\n11:00: 24.78\n12:00: 24.45\n13:00: 24.41\n14:00: 24.52\n15:00: 24.95\n16:00: 25.71\n17:00: 26.83\n18:00: 26.25\n19:00: 24.75\n20:00: 24.00\n21:00: 23.71\n22:00: 22.78\n23:00: 21.47\n\nWe must output in the same format, with the date and time for the next 24 hours starting from 2015-11-17 00:00.\n\nSo:\n\n2015/11/17 0:00 21.20\n2015/11/17 1:00 20.47\n2015/11/17 2:00 20.04\n2015/11/17 3:00 20.13\n2015/11/17 4:00 21.31\n2015/11/17 5:00 22.52\n2015/11/17 6:00 23.96\n2015/11/17 7:00 24.97\n2015/11/17 8:00 25.41\n2015/11/17 9:00 24.66\n2015/11/17 10:00 25.07\n2015/11/17 11:00 24.78\n2015/11/17 12:00 24.45\n2015/11/17 13:00 24.41\n2015/11/17 14:00 24.52\n2015/11/17 15:00 24.95\n2015/11/17 16:00 25.71\n2015/11/17 17:00 26.83\n2015/11/17 18:00 26.25\n2015/11/17 19:00 24.75\n2015/11/17 20:00 24.00\n2015/11/17 21:00 23.71\n2015/11/17 22:00 22.78\n2015/11/17 23:00 21.47\n\nBut note: the prices are in \u20ac/MWh, and we are rounding to two decimals? The input data had two decimals. So we output two decimals.\n\nWe computed the averages and then rounded to two decimals? Actually, we should round the final result to two decimals.\n\nSo recalc with two decimals:\n\nWe'll compute each average and round to two decimals.\n\nBut note: the average might have more than two decimals. We round to two.\n\nAlternatively, we can output with two decimals as per the input.\n\nI will recalc and round to two decimals.\n\nBut to save time, I will use the above computed values and round to two decimals.\n\nFor example, hour0: 21.20 -> 21.20\nhour1: 20.468 -> 20.47\nhour2: 20.036 -> 20.04\nhour3: 20.128 -> 20.13\nhour4: 21.308 -> 21.31\nhour5: 22.52 -> 22.52\nhour5 was 22.52 exactly? 112.60/5=22.52 -> 22.52\nhour6: 23.964 -> 23.96? or 23.96? Actually, 23.964 rounded to two decimals is 23.96.\n\nBut note: the input data had two decimals, so we output two.\n\nSo:\n\n00:00: 21.20\n01:00: 20.47\n02:00: 20.04\n03:00: 20.13\n04:00: 21.31\n05:00: 22.52\n06:00: 23.96\n07:00: 24.97\n08:00: 25.41\n09:00: 24.66\n10:00: 25.07\n11:00: 24.78\n12:00: 24.45\n13:00: 24.41\n14:00: 24.52\n15:00: 24.95\n16:00: 25.71\n17:00: 26.83\n18:00: 26.25\n19:00: 24.75\n20:00: 24.00\n21:00: 23.71\n22:00: 22.78\n23:00: 21.47\n\nBut wait, hour6: 23.964 -> rounding: 23.96 (since 23.964 is closer to 23.96 than 23.97? Actually, 23.964 is 23.96 when rounded to two decimals? \nRounding rule: look at the third decimal, if >=5 then round up.\n\n23.964: third decimal is 4 -> round down -> 23.96.\n\nSimilarly, hour7: 24.974 -> 24.97 (because third decimal is 4 -> round down)\n\nBut wait, 24.974: the third decimal is 4, so 24.97.\n\nBut I had 24.97 in the above? Actually, I wrote 24.97.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nTherefore, the forecast is as above.\n\nNow, we output in the required format.\n",
