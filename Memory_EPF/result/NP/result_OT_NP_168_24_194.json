        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2016/9/20 0:00 to 2016/9/26 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2016/9/27 0:00 to 2016/9/27 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (OT) and no other features (like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours) and no missing values in the provided data. So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices exhibit daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows:\n    - Daily pattern: prices are lower at night and early morning, then rise during the day, especially in the morning and evening peaks.\n    - Weekly pattern: weekdays (Monday to Friday) have higher prices than weekends.\n\n 3. Since we are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables, we can use a model that captures seasonality and trends. Given the short-term forecast (24 hours), we can use:\n    - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) or \n    - Exponential Smoothing (like Holt-Winters) or\n    - A simple approach: use the average of the same hours from the previous days (e.g., average of the last 7 days at 0:00 for the next 0:00) but adjusted for any trend.\n\n 4. However, note that the last day in the historical data is Monday (2016/9/26) and the next day is Tuesday (2016/9/27). So we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (2016/9/20) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a moving average method with seasonality. Let's consider:\n\n    We can compute the average of the same hour for the last 7 days (if available) and then adjust by the trend of the last day.\n\n    But note: the data from 2016/9/20 (Tuesday) to 2016/9/26 (Monday) is 7 days. So for each hour in the next day (Tuesday 2016/9/27), we can take the average of the same hour from the previous 7 days? However, the pattern on Tuesday might be similar to the previous Tuesday but also influenced by the recent days.\n\n 6. Another idea: use the average of the same hour from the last week (i.e., same day of the week) and the day before (Monday) and adjust by the difference between the same day last week and the current week's Monday? But without more data, it's hard.\n\n 7. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only asked for 24 hours, we can use a weighted average of:\n    - The same hour from the previous day (Monday 2016/9/26)\n    - The same hour from the same day of the previous week (Tuesday 2016/9/20)\n\n    And we can also consider the overall trend of the last 24 hours.\n\n 8. However, note that the problem does not to have any missing values and we must provide 24 values.\n\n 9. Let me propose a method:\n\n    For hour h (0 to 23) on 2016/9/27:\n\n        Forecast = (Value at hour h on 2016/9/26 * 0.6) + (Value at hour h on 2016/9/20 * 0.4)\n\n    Why 0.6 and 0.4? Because the previous day is more relevant. But we can adjust if we see a weekly pattern.\n\n 10. But let's check the data: \n        On 2016/9/20 (Tuesday) and 2016/9/26 (Monday) are different days of the week. We might want to use the same day of the week? However, 2016/9/20 was a Tuesday and 2016/9/27 is also a Tuesday. So we can use:\n\n        Forecast = (Value at hour h on the last Monday (2016/9/26) * 0.4) + (Value at hour h on the last Tuesday (2016/9/20) * 0.6) \n\n    But wait, the last Tuesday is 7 days ago and the last Monday is 1 day ago. We might give more weight to the most recent day? However, the same day of the week (Tuesday) from last week might be more representative for the Tuesday pattern.\n\n    Actually, we can use:\n\n        Forecast = (Value at hour h on 2016/9/26 (Monday)) * 0.3 + (Value at hour h on 2016/9/20 (Tuesday)) * 0.5 + (Value at hour h on 2016/9/19 (but we don't have 2016/9/19)) \n\n    We don't have data before 2016/9/20. So we only have one Tuesday (2016/9/20) and one Monday (2016/9/26) and the rest are other days.\n\n 11. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for all the days in the last week (7 days) and then adjust by the trend of the last 24 hours.\n\n    Let base = average of the same hour for the last 7 days.\n\n    Then, we compute the change from the day before yesterday (Sunday 2016/9/25) to yesterday (Monday 2016/9/26) for that hour, and apply that change to the base.\n\n    But we don't have the same day of the week (Tuesday) in the base? Actually, we have one Tuesday (2016/9/20) in the base.\n\n 12. Given the complexity and the fact that we are an expert, we might use a more robust method. However, without the ability to run complex model (like SARIMA) in this environment, we have to use a simple heuristic.\n\n 13. Let's try to capture the weekly seasonality by taking the average of the same hour for the same day of the week in the available history. We have:\n\n        Tuesday: only one data point (2016/9/20) -> so for each hour, we have one value.\n\n        We also have the last 24 hours (Monday 2016/9/26) and we know that Tuesday is typically similar to Monday? But actually, the pattern on Tuesday might be more similar to the previous Tuesday than to the Monday.\n\n 14. We can use:\n\n        Forecast_h = (last_tuesday_h * 0.7) + (last_monday_h * 0.3)\n\n    Why? Because we have only one Tuesday, we rely more on that. But we also consider the recent day (Monday) to adjust for any short-term changes.\n\n 15. However, we can also that the overall level of prices might be changing. We can adjust by the overall level of the last 24 hours relative to the same day last week.\n\n    Let:\n        last_week_avg = average of all 24 hours on 2016/9/20 (Tuesday)\n        this_week_avg = average of all 24 hours on 2016/9/26 (Monday)  [but note: Monday vs Tuesday?]\n\n    Actually, we can compute the average of the entire last week (7 days) and the average of the week before? We don't have the week before.\n\n 16. Since we only have one week of data, we can do:\n\n        level_adjust = (average of 2016/9/26) / (average of 2016/9/19) -> but we don't have 2016/9/19.\n\n    So we skip level adjustment.\n\n 17. Therefore, we will use:\n\n        For hour h (0 to 23) on 2016/9/27:\n            forecast = 0.6 * (value of hour h on 2016/9/20) + 0.4 * (value of hour h on 2016/9/26)\n\n    Why 0.6 and 0.4? Because we have more confidence in the same day of the week pattern (Tuesday) but we also want to account for the most recent day (Monday) which is more current.\n\n 18. But note: the data on 2016/9/26 (Monday) is the most recent and might be more indicative of the current system conditions. However, the day of the week effect is strong. We can adjust the weights.\n\n 19. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days? But that would include weekends and weekdays together. We can try:\n\n        forecast = average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday and one Monday and then Sunday, Saturday, Friday, etc.\n\n 20. Let me list the days:\n\n        2016/9/20: Tuesday (weekday)\n        2016/9/21: Wednesday (weekday)\n        2016/9/22: Thursday (weekday)\n        2016/9/23: Friday (weekday)\n        2016/9/24: Saturday (weekend)\n        2016/9/25: Sunday (weekend)\n        2016/9/26: Monday (weekday)\n\n    For forecasting Tuesday (2016/9/27), we can use the average of the same hour on the last four weekdays: \n        Tuesday (2016/9/20), Wednesday (2016/9/21), Thursday (2016/9/22), Friday (2016/9/23), and Monday (2016/9/26) [but Monday is not the same as Tuesday?]\n\n    But note: Monday is the day before, so it might be more relevant. We can do:\n\n        forecast_h = (Monday_h * 0.4) + (average of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday of the same hour) * 0.6\n\n    But we have only one Tuesday, so the average of the weekdays (excluding Monday) for the same hour would be:\n\n        avg_weekday_h = (h_2016_09_20 + h_2016_09_21 + h_2016_09_22 + h_2016_09_23) / 4\n\n    Then:\n\n        forecast_h = 0.4 * (Monday_h) + 0.6 * (avg_weekday_h)\n\n 21. However, the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included in the weekday average? And we are not using them. But we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday) so we can ignore the weekend.\n\n 22. Let's test with one hour: for hour 0:00:\n\n        Monday (2016/9/26): 23.73\n        Tuesday (2016/9/20): 24.12\n        Wednesday (2016/9/21): 24.55 -> but wait, the hour 0:00 on 2016/9/21 is 24.55? Actually, the data for 2016/9/21 0:00 is 24.55? Let me check:\n\n        The data:\n\n          2016/9/20 0:00: 24.12\n          2016/9/21 0:00: 24.55\n          2016/9/22 0:00: 24.31\n          2016/9/23 0:00: 24.43\n          2016/9/24 0:00: 24.26  -> Saturday, so we don't use\n          2016/9/25 0:00: 23.96  -> Sunday, skip\n          2016/9/26 0:00: 23.73\n\n        So for 0:00, the weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) are: 24.12, 24.55, 24.31, 24.43 -> average = (24.12+24.55+24.31+24.43)/4 = 24.3525\n\n        Then forecast for 2016/9/27 0:00 = 0.4 * 23.73 + 0.6 * 24.3525 = 0.4*23.73 + 0.6*24.3525 = 9.492 + 14.6115 = 24.1035 -> round to 24.10\n\n 23. But note: the price on Monday (23.73) is lower than the average of the previous weekdays (24.35). So we are getting a value in between.\n\n 24. We can also consider that the prices are showing a downward trend? Let's see the 0:00 prices:\n\n        2016/9/20: 24.12\n        2016/9/21: 24.55 (up)\n        2016/9/22: 24.31 (down)\n        2016/9/23: 24.43 (up)\n        2016/9/26: 23.73 (down) -> so it's volatile.\n\n 25. Given the above, we'll use the method:\n\n        For each hour h in [0,23]:\n          Let monday_h = value at hour h on 2016/9/26\n          Let weekday_avg_h = average of the value at hour h on 2016/9/20 (Tuesday), 2016/9/21 (Wednesday), 2016/9/22 (Thursday), 2016/9/23 (Friday)\n\n          forecast_h = 0.4 * monday_h + 0.6 * weekday_avg_h\n\n 26. We choose 0.4 and 0.6 to give more weight to the typical weekday pattern (4 days) and less to the most recent day (which is Monday, not Tuesday). But note that Monday is the most recent and might reflect the current conditions.\n\n 27. We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we might have a better method. But without more data and without the ability to run complex models, this is a reasonable approach.\n\n 29. Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2016/9/27 0:00 to 2016/9/27 23:00) using the above method.\n\n 30. We'll write the forecast in the required format.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Step 1: Extract the data for the weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) and Monday (2016/9/26) for each hour.\n\n   Step 2: For each hour (0 to 23):\n        monday_value = value at that hour on 2016/9/26\n        tue_value = value at that hour on 2016/9/20\n        wed_value = value at that hour on 2016/9/21\n        thu_value = value at that hour on 2016/9/22\n        fri_value = value at that hour on 2016/9/23\n\n        weekday_avg = (tue_value + wed_value + thu_value + fri_value) / 4\n\n        forecast = 0.4 * monday_value + 0.6 * weekday_avg\n\n   Step 3: Round to two decimal places (as in the input data).\n\n 31. But note: the data for 2016/9/26 (Monday) is the last day we have, and we have 24 hours for it.\n\n 32. Let's do the first hour (0:00) as an example:\n\n        monday_0 = 23.73\n        tue_0 = 24.12\n        wed_0 = 24.55\n        thu_0 = 24.31\n        fri_0 = 24.43\n\n        weekday_avg_0 = (24.12+24.55+24.31+24.43)/4 = 97.41/4 = 24.3525\n        forecast_0 = 0.4*23.73 + 0.6*24.3525 = 9.492 + 14.6115 = 24.1035 -> 24.10\n\n 33. For hour 1:00:\n\n        monday_1 = 23.59\n        tue_1 = 24.07\n        wed_1 = 24.21\n        thu_1 = 24.17\n        fri_1 = 24.18\n\n        weekday_avg_1 = (24.07+24.21+24.17+24.18)/4 = 96.63/4 = 24.1575\n        forecast_1 = 0.4*23.59 + 0.6*24.1575 = 9.436 + 14.4945 = 23.9305 -> 23.93\n\n 34. We do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 35. However, note that the data for the weekdays (Tue to Fri) and Monday are all in the provided data.\n\n 36. Let's code this in the answer.\n\n 37. We must output the forecast for the next 24 hours in the same format as the input, but for the dates from 2016/9/27 0:00 to 2016/9/27 23:00.\n\n 38. We write:\n\n        2016/9/27 0:00 <forecast_0>\n        2016/9/27 1:00 <forecast_1>\n        ... \n\n 39. We'll compute all 24.\n\n 40. We note that the weights (0.4 and 0.6) are arbitrary. We choose them because we believe the historical weekday pattern (over the last week) is slightly more important than the most recent day (Monday). But we are open to adjust if we had more data. Since we don't, we stick to this.\n\n 41.

Note: We are not using any complex model due to the constraints, but this method is simple and captures the weekly pattern and the recent day.\n\n 46. Let's compute the entire 24 hours.\n\n 47.

Then output for each hour in the next day (2016/9/27) from 0:00 to 23:00.\n\n 49. We'll do the computation step by step and write the answer.\n\n 50.
