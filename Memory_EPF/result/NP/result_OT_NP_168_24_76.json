        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2014/6/17 0:00 to 2014/6/23 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2014/6/24 0:00 to 2014/6/24 23:00.\n\n Since the problem states that we are an expert in short-term electricity price forecasting and we have only the historical prices (without the other features like grid load or wind power), we must rely on time series forecasting methods.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the data, we have 7 days * 24 hours = 168 data points. The data seems complete (no missing values in the provided records). So we don't need to impute.\n\n 2. We note that electricity prices have strong daily and weekly seasonality. We can use a model that captures these patterns.\n\n 3. Given the requirement for a 24-hour forecast and the availability of exactly one week of data, we can consider a simple method such as using the same day of the previous week (i.e., using the data from 2014/6/17 to 2014/6/23, so the same day would be 2014/6/17 which was a Tuesday, and 2014/6/24 is also a Tuesday). However, note that the data provided starts on Tuesday (2014/6/17) and ends on Monday (2014/6/23). The next day (2014/6/24) is a Tuesday.\n\n 4. Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour of the previous week's same weekday. But note: we have exactly one week of data (7 days). We can compute the average of each hour of the same weekday (Tuesday) in the available data? However, we only have one Tuesday (2014/6/17) in the historical data. So we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n 5. Another approach: use the last week's Tuesday (2014/6/17) as the forecast for the next Tuesday (2014/6/24). But we must adjust for any trend? However, we don't have a long history to compute a trend.\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But given the seasonality, we can use a seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day (Monday, 2014/6/23) or the same day last week (Tuesday, 2014/6/17). \n\n 7. Considering the weekly pattern, we note that the price pattern on weekdays is different from weekends. Since 2014/6/24 is a Tuesday, we should use the most recent Tuesday (2014/6/17) as a reference. However, the market conditions might have changed in a week. \n\n 8. Another idea: use the average of the last few days? But we have a clear weekly pattern. \n\n 9. Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only provided with the price data (and no other features), we decide to use the same day of the previous week (i.e., 2014/6/17) as the forecast for 2014/6/24.\n\n However, note that the data from 2014/6/17 (Tuesday) to 2014/6/23 (Monday) shows a weekly cycle. The next day is Tuesday, so we can use the data from 2014/6/17 (Tuesday) as the forecast for 2014/6/24 (Tuesday).\n\n But let's check: \n  2014/6/17: [23.06, 21.67, 19.85, ... , 25.09]\n  2014/6/24: we will use the same values? \n\n However, we can also see that the overall level of prices in the last few days (especially the weekend) was lower than the weekdays. The last Tuesday (2014/6/17) had prices that were relatively high. The Monday (2014/6/23) had prices that were also high. \n\n 10. Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour of the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one Tuesday. \n\n 11. Another approach: use the average of the same hour of the last 7 days? But that would include weekends and weekdays. We want to capture the Tuesday pattern. \n\n 12. Since we have only one Tuesday in the data, we can use that Tuesday (2014/6/17) as the base and then adjust by the recent trend. \n\n How to adjust? We can compute the ratio (or difference) between the last day (Monday, 2014/6/23) and the same day last week (Monday, 2014/6/16) but we don't have 2014/6/16. Our data starts at 2014/6/17.\n\n 13. We can compute the average of the entire week and then adjust the base Tuesday by the overall change in the week? \n\n 14. Given the complexity and the fact that we are only asked for a forecast without additional features, we will use the seasonal naive method with a weekly cycle. That is, we forecast the next 24 hours (2014/6/24) by the same hours of the previous week (2014/6/17).\n\n Therefore, the forecast for:\n   2014/6/24 0:00 -> 23.06\n   2014/6/24 1:00 -> 21.67\n   ... and so on.\n\n But note: the data for 2014/6/17 (Tuesday) is:\n\n 2014/6/17 0:00 23.06\n 2014/6/17 1:00 21.67\n 2014/6/17 2:00 19.85\n 2014/6/17 3:00 19.81\n 2014/6/17 4:00 19.88\n 2014/6/17 5:00 22.62\n 2014/6/17 6:00 27.67\n 2014/6/17 7:00 32.23\n 2014/6/17 8:00 33.14\n 2014/6/17 9:00 32.89\n 2014/6/17 10:00 33.09\n 2014/6/17 11:00 32.84\n 2014/6/17 12:00 32.29\n 2014/6/17 13:00 31.82\n 2014/6/17 14:00 31.87\n 2014/6/17 15:00 30.22\n 2014/6/17 16:00 29.38\n 2014/6/17 17:00 29.04\n 2014/6/17 18:00 29.11\n 2014/6/17 19:00 29.91\n 2014/6/17 20:00 29.45\n 2014/6/17 21:00 27.86\n 2014/6/17 22:00 26.23\n 2014/6/17 23:00 25.09\n\n So we will output these 24 values for the next day (2014/6/24) at the same hours.\n\n However, note that the problem says \"some data may contain missing values\", but in this provided data there are none. So we are safe.\n\n But let's consider: is this the best? We note that the prices on the last day (2014/6/23, Monday) were generally higher than the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday. However, we can see that the week of 2014/6/17 to 2014/6/23 had a weekend (21st and 22nd) with lower prices. The Monday (23rd) was higher. The Tuesday we are forecasting is the next day after Monday. The previous Tuesday (17th) was the first day of the week in our data. \n\n Without more data, we stick to the weekly naive.\n\n 15. We output the 24 values from 2014/6/17 for the 24 hours of 2014/6/24.\n\n Format: \n   We must output the date and time for the next 24 hours, starting from 2014/6/24 0:00 to 2014/6/24 23:00, and the forecasted price.\n\n Example for the first hour:\n   \"2014/6/24 0:00 23.06\"\n\n But note: the problem says \"Observed Nord Pool electricity price\" and we are forecasting, so we are outputting the forecast.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Please provide the complete forecast for the next 24 hours without omitting any values.\"\n\n We output 24 values.\n\n Let's write the dates correctly:\n\n 2014/6/24 0:00 -> 23.06\n 2014/6/24 1:00 -> 21.67\n 2014/6/24 2:00 -> 19.85\n 2014/6/24 3:00 -> 19.81\n 2014/6/24 4:00 -> 19.88\n 2014/6/24 5:00 -> 22.62\n 2014/6/24 6:00 -> 27.67\n 2014/6/24 7:00 -> 32.23\n 2014/6/24 8:00 -> 33.14\n 2014/6/24 9:00 -> 32.89\n 2014/6/24 10:00 -> 33.09\n 2014/6/24 11:00 -> 32.84\n 2014/6/24 12:00 -> 32.29\n 2014/6/24 13:00 -> 31.82\n 2014/6/24 14:00 -> 31.87\n 2014/6/24 15:00 -> 30.22\n 2014/6/24 16:00 -> 29.38\n 2014/6/24 17:00 -> 29.04\n 2014/6/24 18:00 -> 29.11\n 2014/6/24 19:00 -> 29.91\n 2014/6/24 20:00 -> 29.45\n 2014/6/24 21:00 -> 27.86\n 2014/6/24 22:00 -> 26.23\n 2014/6/24 23:00 -> 25.09\n\n But note: the problem says the data is from Nord Pool, and we are forecasting for the next 24 hours. This is a common naive approach.\n\n However, we must consider that the actual price might be different due to changes in the market. But without more data, this is a reasonable forecast.\n\n 16. We output the above.\n\n But wait: what if we want to use a more sophisticated method? We are constrained by the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data and we are an expert. We don't have the grid load or wind power forecasts for the next 24 hours, so we cannot use a model that requires those.\n\n Therefore, we use the weekly naive forecast.\n\n Let's code the output in the required format.\n",
