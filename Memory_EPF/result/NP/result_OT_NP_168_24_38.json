        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical data (from 2013-09-24 00:00 to 2013-09-30 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2013-10-01 00:00 to 2013-10-01 23:00.\n\n However, note that the problem states that the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the observed electricity prices (OT). Since we don't have the other features, we must rely solely on the historical price data.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: Looking at the provided data, we have 168 consecutive hours (7 days * 24 hours). There are no missing values in the provided data.\n\n 2. We are to forecast the next 24 hours. Since we are only given the target variable (OT) and no exogenous variables, we can use a time series model that captures the daily and weekly seasonality.\n\n 3. Given the data, we observe a clear daily pattern: prices are low at night, start rising in the early morning, peak during the day (especially in the morning and evening), and then drop again at night.\n\n 4. We note that the last day in the data is Monday (2013-09-30). The next 24 hours would be Tuesday (2013-10-01). We might expect a similar pattern to the previous Tuesday (2013-09-24) but adjusted for recent trends.\n\n 5. Since we are not provided with any other data and the problem requires a forecast, we can use a simple method such as:\n    - Using the average of the same hour of the previous days (e.g., average of the last 7 days at 00:00 for forecasting 2013-10-01 00:00) and adjust for the trend if necessary.\n\n 6. However, note that the weekdays might have different patterns than weekends. The data includes:\n        Sep 24 (Tuesday) to Sep 30 (Monday) -> 7 days: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon.\n\n    The next day is Tuesday (Oct 1). So we can use the previous Tuesday (Sep 24) as a reference, but also consider the recent Monday (Sep 30) and the trend.\n\n 7. Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. But given the seasonality, we can compute the hourly averages for weekdays and weekends? However, note that the next day is a Tuesday, so we can take the average of the same hour from the previous weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and the Monday? But note that the pattern on Monday might be similar to Tuesday.\n\n 8. Considering the simplicity and the fact that we don't have other data, we can do:\n\n    For each hour h (0 to 23) in the forecasted day (Oct 1, Tuesday):\n        Let the value for the average of the same hour h from the last 7 days? But that would include weekends which are different.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the same hour from the previous Tuesday (Sep 24) and then adjust by the average change from the last 7 days? \n\n 9. However, a more robust method is to use a seasonal naive approach: use the same hour from the same day of the previous week. But we have exactly 7 days of data, so we can use the value from 7 days ago (i.e., 2013-09-24) for each hour? But that would ignore the recent trend.\n\n 10. Another idea: use the average of the last 3 weekdays for the same hour? But note that the last 3 weekdays are Friday (Sep 27), Monday (Sep 30) and then the previous Tuesday (Sep 24) is 7 days ago. We don't have data for Wednesday, Thursday of the previous week? We have:\n\n        Weekdays: \n          Tuesday (Sep 24) -> day0\n          Wednesday (Sep 25) -> day1\n          Thursday (Sep 26) -> day2\n          Friday (Sep 27) -> day3\n          Saturday (Sep 28) -> weekend\n          Sunday (Sep 29) -> weekend\n          Monday (Sep 30) -> day6\n\n    For forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n        - The previous Tuesday (Sep 24) -> same day of the week\n        - The Monday (Sep 30) is the day before, which might be similar? But Monday and Tuesday are both weekdays.\n\n 11. We can compute the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the past week (excluding weekends) and then adjust by the trend of the last day? \n\n 12. Given the complexity and without a model, we can do:\n\n    Let F(h) = (value from same hour h on previous Tuesday) * (value from the last day (Monday) at hour h) / (value from the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday of the previous week because our data starts on Tuesday).\n\n 13. Alternatively, we can use a weighted average of the last few days, giving more weight to the most recent days and to the same day of the week.\n\n 14. Since we are limited to 168 data points and no other features, we can use a simple average of the same hour over the last 7 days. This will capture the daily seasonality and the weekly pattern to some extent.\n\n    For hour h (0 to 23) on 2013-10-01:\n        forecast = average of the same hour h for the days 2013-09-24 to 2013-09-30.\n\n 15. But note: the weekends (Sep 28 and 29) have lower prices. Since Oct 1 is a Tuesday, we might want to exclude weekends? However, the average of 7 days would include 2 weekend days and 5 weekdays. That might be acceptable.\n\n 16. Let's calculate the average for each hour:\n\n    For example, for 00:00:\n        values: \n            2013-09-24 00:00: 35.29\n            2013-09-25 00:00: 36.89\n            2013-09-26 00:00: 36.07\n            2013-09-27 00:00: 37.27\n            2013-09-28 00:00: 38.00   -> Saturday\n            2013-09-29 00:00: 37.08   -> Sunday\n            2013-09-30 00:00: 36.28   -> Monday\n\n        average = (35.29+36.89+36.07+37.27+38.00+37.08+36.28)/7 = 36.554\n\n    But we see that the last Monday (Sep 30) at 00:00 was 36.28, and the previous Monday we don't have. The average is 36.554.\n\n 17. However, we note that the prices on the last day (Monday, Sep 30) were generally higher than the previous Tuesday (Sep 24). So we might want to give more weight to the recent days.\n\n 18. We can use exponential smoothing, but without a library, we can do a weighted average with weights increasing with recency.\n\n    For example, weights: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] for the 7 days (equal) -> simple average.\n\n    Or weights: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] for the days from oldest to newest? Then the most recent day (Monday) gets weight 7, Sunday weight 6, ... Tuesday (Sep24) weight 1.\n\n    Then for 00:00:\n        = (1*35.29 + 2*36.89 + 3*36.07 + 4*37.27 + 5*38.00 + 6*37.08 + 7*36.28) / (1+2+3+4+5+6+7)\n        = (35.29 + 73.78 + 108.21 + 149.08 + 190.0 + 222.48 + 253.96) / 28\n        = 1032.8 / 28 = 36.8857\n\n 19. We can also consider that the same day of the week (Tuesday) should have more weight? But we only have one Tuesday in the data.\n\n 20. Given the above, we decide to use the weighted average with linear weights (most recent day has the highest weight). The weights for the 7 days (from oldest to newest) are 1 to 7.\n\n 21. We'll compute the 24 forecasts for each hour from 0 to 23.\n\n 22. Steps for each hour h (0 to 23):\n        Let values = [v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6] \n          where v0 = value at hour h on 2013-09-24 (Tuesday)\n          v1 = 2013-09-25 (Wednesday)\n          v2 = 2013-09-26 (Thursday)\n          v6 = 2013-09-30 (Monday)\n\n        weight = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n        forecast = (1*v0 + 2*v1 + 3*v2 + 4*v3 + 5*v4 + 6*v5 + 7*v6) / (1+2+3+4+5+6+7)\n\n 23. The denominator = 28.\n\n 24. We'll compute for each hour.\n\n 25. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three weekdays (Friday, Monday, and the previous Tuesday? But note: Friday was Sep27, Monday Sep30, and Tuesday Sep24 is a week ago). We can do:\n\n        forecast = (v3 (Friday) + v6 (Monday) + v0 (Tuesday)) / 3\n\n    But that might be too simplistic.\n\n 26. Considering the trade-off, I choose the weighted average over 7 days because it uses all data and gives more weight to recent days.\n\n 27. Let's compute the forecast for each hour:\n\n    Hour 0 (00:00):\n        v0 = 35.29 (2013-09-24)\n        v1 = 36.89 (2013-09-25)\n        v2 = 36.07 (2013-09-26)\n        v3 = 37.27 (2013-09-27)\n        v4 = 38.00 (2013-09-28)  # Saturday\n        v5 = 37.08 (2013-09-29)  # Sunday\n        v6 = 36.28 (2013-09-30)  # Monday\n\n        forecast = (1*35.29 + 2*36.89 + 3*36.07 + 4*37.27 + 5*38.00 + 6*37.08 + 7*36.28) / 28\n        = (35.29 + 73.78 + 108.21 + 149.08 + 190.00 + 222.48 + 253.96) / 28\n        = 1032.8 / 28 = 36.8857 -> round to 2 decimals: 36.89\n\n    Hour 1 (01:00):\n        v0 = 34.44\n        v1 = 36.40\n        v2 = 35.89\n        v3 = 36.50\n        v4 = 37.29\n        v5 = 35.74\n        v6 = 35.62\n\n        = 1*34.44 + 2*36.40 + 3*35.89 + 4*36.50 + 5*37.29 + 6*35.74 + 7*35.62\n        = 34.44 + 72.80 + 107.67 + 146.00 + 186.45 + 214.44 + 249.34 = 1011.14\n        /28 = 36.112857 -> 36.11\n\n    We'll do this for all 24 hours.\n\n 28. However, note that the problem says \"some data may contain missing values\", but in this case there are none. So we proceed.\n\n 29. We'll compute the 24 values and output them.\n\n 30. Alternatively, we can write a small code to compute, but since we are to do it manually, we do the first few and then the rest similarly.\n\n 31. We'll create a list for each hour of the 7 days:\n\n    Hour 0: [35.29, 36.89, 36.07, 37.27, 38.00, 37.08, 36.28] -> 36.89\n    Hour 1: [34.44, 36.40, 35.89, 36.50, 37.29, 35.74, 35.62] -> 36.11\n    Hour 2: [34.07, 35.97, 35.18, 36.26, 36.81, 35.09, 35.50] -> \n        = 1*34.07 + 2*35.97 + 3*35.18 + 4*36.26 + 5*36.81 + 6*35.09 + 7*35.50\n        = 34.07 + 71.94 + 105.54 + 145.04 + 184.05 + 210.54 + 248.5 = 999.68 / 28 = 35.702857 -> 35.70\n    Hour 3: [34.30, 36.09, 35.04, 35.96, 36.11, 34.95, 35.31] -> \n        = 34.30*1 + 36.09*2 + 35.04*3 + 35.96*4 + 36.11*5 + 34.95*6 + 35.31*7\n        = 34.30 + 72.18 + 105.12 + 143.84 + 180.55 + 209.70 + 247.17 = 992.86 / 28 = 35.459286 -> 35.46\n\n    ... and so on.\n\n 32. We'll do this for all 24 hours and then output the forecast for 2013-10-01 00:00 to 2013-10-01 23:00.\n\n 33. But note: the problem says the next 24 recorded hours, so we start at 00:00 and go to 23:00.\n\n 34. We'll compute the 24 hours and round to two decimals.\n\n 35. Alternatively, we can use a more sophisticated method? But without additional data and without a model, the weighted average is a reasonable baseline.\n\n 36. Let's compute the 24 hours:\n\n    We'll create a table:\n\n    Hour | v0 (24) | v1 (25) | v2 (26) | v3 (27) | v4 (28) | v5 (29) | v6 (30) | weighted sum | forecast (rounded to 2 decimals)\n\n    We do the computation programmatically in our mind, but we'll write a script in our thoughts.\n\n    We'll do:\n\n        h0: (1*35.29 + 2*36.89 + 3*36.07 + 4*37.27 + 5*38.00 + 6*37.08 + 7*36.28) = 1032.8 -> 36.89\n        h1: (1*34.44 + 2*36.40 + 3*35.89 + 4*36.50 + 5*37.29 + 6*35.74 + 7*35.62) = 1011.14 -> 36.11\n        h2: (1*34.07 + 2*35.97 + 3*35.18 + 4*36.26 + 5*36.81 + 6*35.09 + 7*35.50) = 999.68 -> 35.70\n        h3: (1*34.30 + 2*36.09 + 3*35.04 + 4*35.96 + 5*36.11 + 6*34.95 + 7*35.31) = 992.86 -> 35.46\n        h4: (1*34.96 + 2*36.35 + 3*35.96 + 4*36.43 + 5*36.03 + 6*34.93 + 7*35.92) = 1000.22 -> 35.72\n        h5: (1*36.46 + 2*37.44 + 3*37.27 + 4*37.51 + 5*36.40 + 6*35.16 + 7*37.39) = 1023.18 -> 36.54\n        h6: (1*41.23 + 2*41.20 + 3*41.89 + 4*40.45 + 5*37.17 + 6*35.80 + 7*39.57) = 1058.31 -> 37.80\n        h7: (we'll do one more)\n          v0=44.70, v1=45.67, v2=45.04, v3=42.42, v4=37.68, v5=36.29, v6=44.16\n          = 1*44.70 + 2*45.67 + 3*45.04 + 4*42.42 + 5*37.68 + 6*36.29 + 7*44.16\n          = 44.70 + 91.34 + 135.12 + 169.68 + 188.40 + 217.74 + 309.12 = 1156.1 -> 1156.1/28 = 41.29\n\n    We'll do the rest similarly.\n\n 37. However, this is time-consuming. We can write a small program in our mind to compute. But since we are to provide the answer, we'll compute all.\n\n 38. Alternatively, we can use the average of the last three weekdays (Friday, Monday, and the previous Tuesday) for the same hour? That might be more representative of a weekday.
