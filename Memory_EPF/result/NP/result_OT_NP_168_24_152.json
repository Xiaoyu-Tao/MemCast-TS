        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2015-12-01 00:00 to 2015-12-07 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours, i.e., from 2015-12-08 00:00 to 2015-12-08 23:00.\n\nHowever, note that the problem mentions that the dataset also includes grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are only provided with the historical observed prices (OT). Since we don't have the other variables, we must rely solely on the historical price data for forecasting.\n\nGiven the nature of electricity prices (time series with daily and weekly seasonality, and possibly other patterns), we can use a time series forecasting method. Since we are to forecast 24 hours ahead (short-term) and we have 168 points (exactly one week of hourly data), we can use a model that captures daily patterns and weekly patterns if present.\n\nApproach:\n1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 entries, 24*7=168). So no missing values in the given history.\n2. We note that the data has:\n   - Daily seasonality: prices tend to be lower at night and higher during the day.\n   - Weekly pattern: weekdays vs weekends (we see lower prices on the weekend: Dec 5 and 6 are Saturday and Sunday, and Dec 7 is Monday).\n\nWe can use a simple seasonal naive approach or a seasonal ARIMA model. However, without additional variables and with only 168 points, we can also consider exponential smoothing (with seasonality) or a simple average of the same hour from the last few days.\n\nGiven the requirement for a quick response and the fact that we are only using the provided data, we can use a method that averages the same hour from the previous days, but with more weight on recent days and also accounting for the day of the week.\n\nBut note: the last day in the data is Monday (2015-12-07). We are to forecast Tuesday (2015-12-08). So we can look at the previous Tuesday (2015-12-01) and also the Monday (2015-12-07) to account for the pattern.\n\nHowever, a more robust method is to use a moving window or exponential smoothing. Alternatively, we can use the last week's same day (Tuesday) and adjust with the most recent day (Monday) to capture the trend.\n\nBut note: the data shows that the first day (2015-12-01) is a Tuesday. The next day to forecast is also a Tuesday (2015-12-08). So we can use the previous Tuesday (2015-12-01) as a base and then adjust by the change from the previous Monday (2015-12-07) relative to the Monday a week before (2015-11-30, which we don't have). \n\nAlternatively, we can use a simple average of the last 7 days for each hour? But that would include the weekend pattern which is different.\n\nGiven the complexity and without having the data for the Monday a week before, we can do:\n\nOption 1: Use the same day of the previous week (i.e., Tuesday 2015-12-01) as the forecast for 2015-12-08. But that ignores the recent trend.\n\nOption 2: Use a weighted average of the last few days for the same hour, with more weight on the most recent days and the same day of the previous week.\n\nWe can try a simple model: \n   Forecast for hour h on Tuesday = (value from hour h on the previous Tuesday + value from hour h on the most recent day (Monday)) / 2\n\nBut note: the most recent day (Monday) is 2015-12-07, and the previous Tuesday is 2015-12-01.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour over the last three weekdays? But we don't have enough weekdays (only one Monday and one Tuesday in the data? Actually, we have:\n   Tuesday: 2015-12-01\n   Wednesday: 2015-12-02\n   Thursday: 2015-12-03\n   Friday: 2015-12-04\n   Saturday: 2015-12-05\n   Sunday: 2015-12-06\n   Monday: 2015-12-07\n\nSo for the forecast of Tuesday 2015-12-08, we can use the average of the same hour on the last Tuesday (2015-12-01) and the same hour (adjusted by the trend from Monday relative to the Monday of the previous week? but we don't have the previous Monday).\n\nAlternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing for each hour? But that would require more data.\n\nGiven the constraints, I propose:\n\nFor each hour h (0 to 23):\n   Let last_tuesday_h = value at hour h on 2015-12-01\n   Let last_monday_h = value at hour h on 2015-12-07\n\nBut we don't have the Monday of the previous week to compute a trend. So we can use the change from the last Tuesday to the last Monday? That is, the trend over the week? \n\nAlternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for the last 7 days and then adjust by the overall trend? \n\nBut note: the data has a weekly pattern. The weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are different. So we should only use weekdays? \n\nWe are forecasting a Tuesday. We have one previous Tuesday (2015-12-01) and we also have the Monday (2015-12-07) which is the day before. We can also look at the Tuesday of the previous week and the Monday of the previous week? But we don't have the Monday.\n\nGiven the data, I will use:\n\n   forecast_h = (last_tuesday_h * 0.6 + last_monday_h * 0.4)\n\nWhy 0.6 and 0.4? Because the same day of the week is more relevant, but the most recent day (Monday) is also very relevant. We can adjust the weights.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays that are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? But we only have one Tuesday.\n\nAnother idea: use the average of the same hour for the last 7 days, but that would include weekend days which are lower. Since the forecast day is a weekday (Tuesday), we can use only the weekdays in the last week? \n\nWe have 5 weekdays: \n   Tuesday (2015-12-01)\n   Wednesday (2015-12-02)\n   Thursday (2015-12-03)\n   Friday (2015-12-04)\n   Monday (2015-12-07)   [note: Monday is the previous day, and we skip the weekend]\n\nSo for each hour h, we can compute the average_weekday_h = (h_tue + h_wed + h_thu + h_fri + h_mon) / 5\n\nBut note: the Monday is the most recent and might be more relevant. We can do a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days. For example, weights: Monday (0.3), Friday (0.2), Thursday (0.2), Wednesday (0.2), Tuesday (0.1). \n\nBut without a strong reason, we can use equal weights.\n\nLet me test for one hour: hour 0 (midnight) of the weekdays:\n\n   Tue: 20.61\n   Wed: 22.86 -> actually, note: the data for 2015-12-02 0:00 is 22.86? But wait, the data for 2015-12-01 0:00 is 20.61, then 2015-12-02 0:00 is 22.86? That's the next day (Wednesday) at 0:00? Actually, the date for 2015-12-02 0:00 is the first hour of Wednesday.\n\nSo for hour 0 (00:00) of each weekday:\n\n   Tuesday (2015-12-01): 20.61\n   Wednesday (2015-12-02): 22.86\n   Thursday (2015-12-03): 20.72\n   Friday (2015-12-04): 19.49\n   Monday (2015-12-07): 15.20\n\nAverage = (20.61+22.86+20.72+19.49+15.20)/5 = 19.776\n\nBut the previous Tuesday was 20.61 and the Monday (yesterday) was 15.20. The average is 19.776. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same day of the week (Tuesday) and the previous day (Monday) and then the same day of the previous week? \n\nBut note: the Monday (15.20) is very low compared to the Tuesday of last week (20.61). There might be a downward trend? \n\nWe can also compute the average of the last two weekdays (Friday and Monday) and the same day last week? \n\nGiven the complexity and without a clear trend, I will use the average of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (with equal weights) to forecast the next weekday (Tuesday). \n\nBut note: the weekend is in between, so the Monday is after the weekend. The pattern might be that after the weekend, the prices drop? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two Tuesdays? But we only have one.\n\nGiven the data limitations, I will use the average of the same hour for the last 5 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Monday) to forecast the next Tuesday.\n\nSo for each hour h (0 to 23), we compute:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_h on 2015-12-01 + price_h on 2015-12-02 + price_h on 2015-12-03 + price_h on 2015-12-04 + price_h on 2015-12-07) / 5\n\nBut note: the day of the week for 2015-12-07 is Monday, which is the day before the forecast day (Tuesday). This might be the most relevant. We can also use a weighted average that gives more weight to the Monday and the last Tuesday? \n\nHowever, to keep it simple and given that we don't have a strong reason, I will use the simple average.\n\nLet me check the hour 7:00 (morning peak) for the weekdays:\n\n   Tue: 24.27\n   Wed: 30.00\n   Thu: 26.82\n   Fri: 22.01\n   Mon: 21.96\n\nAverage = (24.27+30.00+26.82+22.01+21.96)/5 = 25.012\n\nThe previous Tuesday at 7:00 was 24.27, and the Monday was 21.96. The average is 25.012.\n\nWe'll do this for every hour.\n\nBut note: the data for 2015-12-07 (Monday) is the most recent and might be more indicative. We can try:\n\n   forecast_h = 0.4 * (Monday_h) + 0.3 * (Tuesday_h) + 0.1 * (Wednesday_h) + 0.1 * (Thursday_h) + 0.1 * (Friday_h)\n\nBut without validation, we stick to the average.\n\nSo we will compute the average for each hour of the 5 weekdays.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Extract the data for each hour from the 5 weekdays: \n   - Tuesday (2015-12-01): hours 0 to 23\n   - Wednesday (2015-12-02): hours 0 to 23\n   - Thursday (2015-12-03): hours 0 to 23\n   - Friday (2015-12-04): hours 0 to 23\n   - Monday (2015-12-07): hours 0 to 23\n\n2. For each hour in 0-23, average the 5 values.\n\n3. The forecast for 2015-12-08 (Tuesday) from 00:00 to 23:00 is the 24 averages.\n\nLet's do it:\n\nHour 0: (20.61 [Tue] + 22.86 [Wed] + 20.72 [Thu] + 19.49 [Fri] + 15.20 [Mon]) / 5 = (20.61+22.86+20.72+19.49+15.20)=98.88 -> 98.88/5 = 19.776\nHour 1: (19.49+22.45+20.28+18.69+14.31)/5 = (19.49+22.45+20.28+18.69+14.31)=95.22 -> 95.22/5=19.044\nHour 2: (19.24+21.71+20.22+17.93+14.18)/5 = (19.24+21.71+20.22+17.93+14.18)=93.28 -> 93.28/5=18.656\nHour 3: (19.40+21.77+20.54+17.36+14.34)/5 = (19.40+21.77+20.54+17.36+14.34)=93.41 -> 93.41/5=18.682\nHour 4: (20.53+22.96+21.43+17.90+15.18)/5 = (20.53+22.96+21.43+17.90+15.18)=97.00 -> 97.00/5=19.4\nHour 5: (22.02+23.31+22.20+19.50+16.99)/5 = (22.02+23.31+22.20+19.50+16.99)=104.02 -> 104.02/5=20.804\nHour 6: (23.17+24.38+23.32+21.17+19.94)/5 = (23.17+24.38+23.32+21.17+19.94)=111.98 -> 111.98/5=22.396\nHour 7: (24.27+30.00+26.82+22.01+21.96)/5 = (24.27+30.00+26.82+22.01+21.96)=125.06 -> 125.06/5=25.012\nHour 8: (25.09+35.32+30.03+22.44+22.40)/5 = (25.09+35.32+30.03+22.44+22.40)=135.28 -> 135.28/5=27.056\nHour 9: (24.95+31.64+28.59+22.25+22.29)/5 = (24.95+31.64+28.59+22.25+22.29)=129.72 -> 129.72/5=25.944\nHour 10: (25.02+28.55+25.88+21.95+22.32)/5 = (25.02+28.55+25.88+21.95+22.32)=123.72 -> 123.72/5=24.744\nHour 11: (25.07+28.03+25.97+21.99+22.50)/5 = (25.07+28.03+25.97+21.99+22.50)=123.56 -> 123.56/5=24.712\nHour 12: (24.74+26.10+25.38+21.90+22.59)/5 = (24.74+26.10+25.38+21.90+22.59)=120.71 -> 120.71/5=24.142\nHour 13: (24.86+25.73+25.25+21.82+22.88)/5 = (24.86+25.73+25.25+21.82+22.88)=120.54 -> 120.54/5=24.108\nHour 14: (25.41+25.59+25.39+21.84+23.86)/5 = (25.41+25.59+25.39+21.84+23.86)=122.09 -> 122.09/5=24.418\nHour 15: (26.35+26.16+27.07+21.91+26.15)/5 = (26.35+26.16+27.07+21.91+26.15)=127.64 -> 127.64/5=25.528\nHour 16: (27.94+26.15+29.57+21.99+27.91)/5 = (27.94+26.15+29.57+21.99+27.91)=133.56 -> 133.56/5=26.712\nHour 17: (28.64+26.04+32.08+22.00+28.55)/5 = (28.64+26.04+32.08+22.00+28.55)=137.31 -> 137.31/5=27.462\nHour 18: (27.25+25.32+25.94+21.92+26.60)/5 = (27.25+25.32+25.94+21.92+26.60)=127.03 -> 127.03/5=25.406\nHour 19: (25.21+23.92+24.40+21.45+23.39)/5 = (25.21+23.92+24.40+21.45+23.39)=118.37 -> 118.37/5=23.674\nHour 20: (24.08+23.26+23.08+20.80+22.23)/5 = (24.08+23.26+23.08+20.80+22.23)=113.45 -> 113.45/5=22.69\nHour 21: (23.48+22.99+22.81+20.45+21.69)/5 = (23.48+22.99+22.81+20.45+21.69)=111.42 -> 111.42/5=22.284\nHour 22: (22.87+22.17+22.18+19.71+20.43)/5 = (22.87+22.17+22.18+19.71+20.43)=107.36 -> 107.36/5=21.472\nHour 23: (22.23+21.19+21.20+18.58+19.51)/5 = (22.23+21.19+21.20+18.58+19.51)=102.71 -> 102.71/5=20.542\n\nSo the forecast for 2015-12-08 (Tuesday) from 00:00 to 23:00 is:\n\n00:00: 19.78\n01:00: 19.04\n02:00: 18.66\n03:00: 18.68\n04:00: 19.40\n05:00: 20.80\n06:00: 22.40\n07:00: 25.01\n08:00: 27.06\n09:00: 25.94\n10:00: 24.74\n11:00: 24.71\n12:00: 24.14\n13:00: 24.11\n14:00: 24.42\n15:00: 25.53\n16:00: 26.71\n17:00: 27.46\n18:00: 25.41\n19:00: 23.67\n20:00: 22.69\n21:00: 22.28\n22:00: 21.47\n23:00: 20.54\n\nBut note: we must output with two decimal places?

We see that the Monday prices were generally lower than the previous weekdays. So the average might be a bit low? But without more data, we stick to the average.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the median?
