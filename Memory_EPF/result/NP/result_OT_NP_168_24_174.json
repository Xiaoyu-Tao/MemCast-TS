        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2016/5/3 0:00 to 2016/5/9 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours, which would be from 2016/5/10 0:00 to 2016/5/10 23:00.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 entries for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a time series forecasting method that uses only the historical prices.\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily and weekly seasonality. The data shows a clear daily pattern (lower at night, higher during the day) and also weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends).\n\n Approach:\n We can use a simple but effective method for short-term forecasting: Seasonal Naive method or a model that captures daily seasonality. However, we have 7 days of data (a full week) so we can also consider weekly patterns.\n\n Since the task is to forecast the next 24 hours (one day) and we have 7 days of history, we can use the same day of the previous week (i.e., the data from 2016/5/3, which was a Tuesday) as a starting point? But note: \n  - 2016/5/3: Tuesday\n  - 2016/5/10: Tuesday (next week same day)\n\n However, looking at the data, we see that the pattern of weekdays and weekends are different. The day we are forecasting (2016/5/10) is a Tuesday, so we can use the previous Tuesday (2016/5/3) as a reference? But note that we have 7 days of data, so we can also average the same hour of the previous days? \n\n But note: the data from 2016/5/3 to 2016/5/9 covers:\n  5/3: Tuesday\n  5/4: Wednesday\n  5/5: Thursday\n  5/6: Friday\n  5/7: Saturday\n  5/8: Sunday\n  5/9: Monday\n\n We are forecasting 5/10: Tuesday.\n\n We can try to use the average of the same hour of the previous week's same day (only one Tuesday: 5/3) and also the Monday (5/9) and the Wednesday (5/4) to capture the neighboring weekdays? However, without more Tuesdays, we cannot average multiple Tuesdays.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing that accounts for daily seasonality.\n\n Given the simplicity and the fact that we are only required to forecast 24 hours, we can use:\n\n Option 1: Use the same day of the previous week (5/3) as the forecast for 5/10. But we have only one Tuesday in the data.\n\n Option 2: Use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? That would smooth out the daily pattern.\n\n Option 3: Use a daily seasonal model with a window of 24 hours. We can compute the average of each hour over the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and then adjust for the most recent trend? But note that the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) have different patterns.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use:\n   - The previous Tuesday (5/3) and the Monday (5/9) and the Wednesday (5/4) to form a baseline.\n\n However, the data shows that the prices on 5/3 (Tuesday) and 5/4 (Wednesday) are higher than the weekend. The Monday (5/9) is also a weekday and has a similar pattern.\n\n We can try to take the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the past week? But note we only have one full week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average where the most days have higher weights? \n\n Considering the limitations, I propose:\n\n 1. Use the average of the same hour for the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) for the available days. Note: we have:\n    Tuesday (5/3), Wednesday (5/4), Thursday (5/5), Friday (5/6), Monday (5/9). We skip Saturday and Sunday.\n\n 2. But note: the data for Monday (5/9) is the day before the forecast day, so it might be more relevant.\n\n 3. We can also consider a simple method: use the previous day (Monday 5/9) as the forecast for Tuesday 5/10? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n 4. Another idea: use the average of the same hour of the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same day last week (Tuesday). \n\n However, without more data, we have to be pragmatic.\n\n Let me check the data for Monday (5/9) and Tuesday (5/3) and Wednesday (5/4):\n\n For example, at hour 0:00:\n   5/3: 21.75\n   5/4: 22.14\n   5/5: 23.12\n   5/6: 20.73\n   5/9: 15.75\n\n The average for 0:00 on weekdays: (21.75+22.14+23.12+20.73+15.75)/5 = 20.698\n\n But the value for Monday (5/9) at 0:00 is 15.75, which is much lower. This might be because of a downward trend? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average that gives more weight to the most recent days. For example, weights: \n   Monday (5/9): weight 3\n   Friday (5/6): weight 2\n   Thursday (5/5): weight 1\n   Wednesday (5/4): weight 1\n   Tuesday (5/3): weight 1\n\n Then for 0:00: (15.75*3 + 20.73*2 + 23.12*1 + 22.14*1 + 21.75*1) / (3+2+1+1+1) = (47.25 + 41.46 + 23.12 + 22.14 + 21.75) / 8 = 155.72 / 8 = 19.465\n\n But we don't know if this is the best.\n\n Alternatively, we can use exponential smoothing with daily seasonality. However, without a library, we have to do it manually.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the provided data, I choose a simpler method:\n\n We note that the prices on the last day (Monday 5/9) are the most recent and might reflect the current market conditions. However, the day we are forecasting is a Tuesday, which might have a pattern similar to the previous Tuesday (5/3) and the following Wednesday (5/4) but adjusted by the recent trend.\n\n We can compute the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) and then adjust by the overall trend from the last 24 hours.\n\n However, let me look at the overall trend: \n   The prices on 5/9 (Monday) are generally lower than the previous Tuesday (5/3). \n\n We can compute the ratio or the difference? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on 5/10 = (Price of hour h on 5/9) * (Price of hour h on 5/3) / (Price of hour h on 5/2) \n   But we don't have 5/2.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use the average of the same hour for the weekdays in the past week (excluding the weekend) but with a simple adjustment: \n   We take the average of the same hour for the weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday) and then adjust by the ratio of the last 24 hours average to the average of the same 24 hours a week ago? \n\n But note: the last 24 hours (Monday 5/9) and the same 24 hours a week ago (Tuesday 5/3) are both weekdays.\n\n Step:\n   Let A = average of the prices for the last 24 hours (Monday 5/9) = average of the 24 values for 5/9.\n   Let B = average of the prices for the same day last week (Tuesday 5/3) = average of the 24 values for 5/3.\n\n   Then the trend factor = A / B.\n\n   Then for each hour h, we take the average of the same hour h for the weekdays (5/3, 5/4, 5/5, 5/6, 5/9) and multiply by the trend factor.\n\n But note: we are including Monday (5/9) in both the average and the trend factor? \n\n Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for the weekdays (without Monday) and then adjust by the trend factor computed from Monday and the previous Monday? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the average of the same hour for the weekdays (without Monday) and then adjust by the ratio of the last Monday (5/9) to the previous Monday? We don't have the previous Monday.\n\n Given the data, I will do:\n\n   Let base_forecast_h = average of hour h for the weekdays: 5/3 (Tuesday), 5/4 (Wednesday), 5/5 (Thursday), 5/6 (Friday), and 5/9 (Monday)\n\n   Then, to account for the recent level, we can adjust by the ratio of the average of the last 24 hours (Monday 5/9) to the average of the base_forecast for the 24 hours of Monday? \n\n   But note: we are forecasting for Tuesday, so we don't have a base_forecast for Monday? \n\n   Alternatively, we can adjust the entire base_forecast for the next day by the ratio of the actual Monday (5/9) to the average of the same Monday hours from the base_forecast? \n\n   How? \n      Let base_Monday_h = average of hour h for the weekdays (but note: we don't have a separate base for Monday? We are including Monday in the base_forecast)\n\n   This might be circular.\n\n Considering the time and simplicity, I will use the average of the same hour for the weekdays (5/3, 5/4, 5/5, 5/6, 5/9) without adjustment.\n\n But note: the average for each hour:\n\n   For hour 0:00: (21.75 + 22.14 + 23.12 + 20.73 + 15.75) / 5 = 20.698\n\n   For hour 1:00: (21.11 + 21.46 + 21.86 + 19.08 + 13.10) / 5 = 19.322\n\n   ... and so on.\n\n However, we note that the Monday (5/9) is the most recent and has a lower level. The average might be pulled down by Monday. But the forecast day is a Tuesday, and the previous Tuesday was higher. \n\n Another idea: use the same day last week (Tuesday 5/3) and then adjust by the change from the previous Monday (5/2) to the current Monday (5/9) but we don't have 5/2.\n\n Given the complexity, and since we are only required to provide a forecast, I will use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays: Monday (5/9), Friday (5/6), and Thursday (5/5). Why these? Because they are the most recent weekdays. We skip the weekend and the earlier weekdays.\n\n But note: \n   Thursday (5/5) and Friday (5/6) are also weekdays and Monday (5/9) is the next weekday. The forecast day is Tuesday, which is after Monday.\n\n We can use: \n   Forecast for hour h = (Price_h on Monday + Price_h on Friday + Price_h on Thursday) / 3\n\n However, that would ignore the Tuesday pattern? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday and Friday) and the same day last week (Tuesday) but with weights: \n   Monday: 0.5, Friday: 0.3, Tuesday: 0.2\n\n But without validation, it's arbitrary.\n\n After reviewing the data, I notice that the prices on Monday (5/9) are lower than the previous Tuesday (5/3) and the Wednesday (5/4). There might be a downward trend. \n\n I decide to use the average of the same hour for the last two weekdays (Monday 5/9 and Friday 5/6) and then adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday (5/3) and the Monday (5/9) for the same hour? \n\n But that might be too complex.\n\n Given the time, I will use a simple method: \n   Use the same hour from the previous day (Monday 5/9) as the forecast for Tuesday 5/10. \n\n Why? \n   - The most recent day is often the best predictor for the next day, especially in electricity markets with short-term dependencies.\n\n However, we note that the day of the week effect: Tuesday might be different from Monday. But without more data, we cannot fully account for it.\n\n Alternatively, we can adjust the Monday pattern by the average change from Monday to Tuesday in the previous week? \n\n   In the previous week:\n        Monday (5/2) is not available, so we cannot compute.\n\n Therefore, I will use the Monday (5/9) pattern as the base and then adjust by the average change from Monday to Tuesday from the only week we have? But we don't have the previous Monday.\n\n So, I decide to use the Monday (5/9) values as the forecast for Tuesday (5/10) with a small upward adjustment? \n\n But looking at the previous week: \n   From Monday (not available) to Tuesday (5/3) we don't know.\n\n Given the above, I will use the prices of Monday (5/9) as the forecast for Tuesday (5/10) but note that the problem requires 24 values and we have the 24 values for Monday (5/9). \n\n However, let me compare the Monday (5/9) and the previous Tuesday (5/3):\n\n   Monday (5/9) at 0:00: 15.75, Tuesday (5/3) at 0:00: 21.75 -> Tuesday was higher.\n   Monday (5/9) at 7:00: 26.59, Tuesday (5/3) at 7:00: 25.69 -> Tuesday was lower.\n\n So it's mixed.\n\n Considering the complexity and the lack of data for a more sophisticated model, I will use the naive method: the last available day (Monday 5/9) as the forecast for the next day (Tuesday 5/10). \n\n This is a common baseline in forecasting.\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2016/5/10 0:00 is 15.75 (the same as 2016/5/9 0:00), for 1:00 is 13.10, and so on.\n\n But note: the problem says we are an expert, so we should do better.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last three days that are weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) for each hour.\n\n Let me compute for hour 0:00: (Monday 5/9: 15.75, Friday 5/6: 20.73, Thursday 5/5: 23.12) -> average = (15.75+20.73+23.12)/3 = 19.8667\n\n For hour 1:00: (13.10 + 19.08 + 21.86)/3 = 18.0133\n\n But this might be more stable.\n\n Given the above, I choose to use the average of the last three weekdays (Thursday, Friday, Monday) for each hour.\n\n The weekdays are: \n   Thursday: 2016/5/5\n   Friday: 2016/5/6\n   Monday: 2016/5/9\n\n We skip the weekend days (5/7 and 5/8) because they are not weekdays.\n\n So, for each hour (0 to 23), we compute:\n   forecast_h = (price_h on 5/5 + price_h on 5/6 + price_h on 5/9) / 3\n\n Let's do an example:\n   hour 0: (23.12 + 20.73 + 15.75) / 3 = 59.6 / 3 = 19.8667\n   hour 1: (21.86 + 19.08 + 13.10) / 3 = 54.04 / 3 = 18.0133\n   hour 2: (21.26 + 18.46 + 12.49) / 3 = 52.21 / 3 = 17.4033\n   ... and so on.\n\n This method uses the most recent weekdays and averages out some noise.\n\n We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note that the data for Monday (5/9) is the most recent and might be more relevant. We are giving equal weight to Thursday, Friday, and Monday. We could give more weight to Monday, but for simplicity, we use equal weights.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2016/5/10 0:00 to 2016/5/10 23:00) using this method.\n\n We have the data for:\n   2016/5/5 (Thursday): 24 hours\n   2016/5/6 (Friday): 24 hours\n   2016/5/9 (Monday): 24 hours\n\n We'll create a list for each hour of the day (0 to 23) by averaging the three values.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   hour0: [5/5 0:00: 23.12, 5/6 0:00: 20.73, 5/9 0:00: 15.75] -> 19.8667\n   hour1: [5/5 1:00: 21.86, 5/6 1:00: 19.08, 5/9 1:00: 13.10] -> 18.0133\n   hour2: [5/5 2:00: 21.26, 5/6 2:00: 18.46, 5/9 2:00: 12.49] -> 17.4033\n   hour3: [5/5 3:00: 20.26, 5/6 3:00: 18.24, 5/9 3:00: 12.35] -> 16.95\n   hour4: [5/5 4:00: 19.79, 5/6 4:00: 19.11, 5/9 4:00: 14.71] -> 17.87\n   hour5: [5/5 5:00: 20.27, 5/6 5:00: 21.15, 5/9 5:00: 20.12] -> 20.5133\n   hour6: [5/5 6:00: 20.44, 5/6 6:00: 23.05, 5/9 6:00: 22.47] -> 21.9867\n   hour7: [5/5 7:00: 20.73, 5/6 7:00: 24.00, 5/9 7:00: 26.59] -> 23.7733\n   hour8: [5/5 8:00: 21.34, 5/6 8:00: 25.27, 5/9 8:00: 28.92] -> 25.1767\n   hour9: [5/5 9:00: 21.54, 5/6 9:00: 25.63, 5/9 9:00: 28.00] -> 25.0567\n   hour10: [5/5 10:00: 21.47, 5/6 10:00: 23.96, 5/9 10:00: 24.24] -> 23.2233\n   hour11: [5/5 11:00: 21.29, 5/6 11:00: 23.08, 5/9 11:00: 22.82] -> 22.3967\n   hour12: [5/5 12:00: 20.98, 5/6 12:00: 22.45, 5/9 12:00: 22.38] -> 21.9367\n   hour13: [5/5 13:00: 20.62, 5/6 13:00: 22.12, 5/9 13:00: 22.19] -> 21.6433\n   hour14: [5/5 14:00: 20.19, 5/6 14:00: 21.75, 5/9 14:00: 22.02] -> 21.32\n   hour15: [5/5 15:00: 19.67, 5/6 15:00: 20.87, 5/9 15:00: 22.01] -> 20.85\n   hour16: [5/5 16:00: 19.71, 5/6 16:00: 20.66, 5/9 16:00: 21.94] -> 20.77\n   hour17: [5/5 17:00: 20.48, 5/6 17:00: 21.85, 5/9 17:00: 22.76] -> 21.6967\n   hour18: [5/5 18:00: 21.46, 5/6 18:00: 22.91, 5/9 18:00: 22.87] -> 22.4133\n   hour19: [5/5 19:00: 23.42, 5/6 19:00: 22.76, 5/9 19:00: 22.81] -> 23.0\n   hour20: [5/5 20:00: 23.26, 5/6 20:00: 22.25, 5/9 20:00: 22.43] -> 22.6467\n   hour21: [5/5 21:00: 23.52, 5/6 21:00: 22.09, 5/9 21:00: 22.70] -> 22.77\n   hour22: [5/5 22:00: 23.35, 5/6 22:00: 21.80, 5/9 22:00: 22.13] -> 22.4267\n   hour23: [5/5 23:00: 21.62, 5/6 23:00: 20.91, 5/9 23:00: 21.31] -> 21.28\n\n We'll round to two decimal places as in the input.\n\n So the forecast for 2016/5/10 0:00: 19.87\n ...\n\n We output 24 values.\n\n However, note: the data for Monday (5/9) is the most recent and might be more indicative of the level.
