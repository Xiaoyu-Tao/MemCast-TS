        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2013-10/15 00:00 to 2013-10/21 23:00). We are to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2013-10/22 00:00 to 2013-10/22 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). No missing values in the given data.\n 2. Since we are only given the historical prices (OT) and no exogenous variables (like grid load or wind power forecasts) for the future, we must rely on a univariate time series forecasting method.\n 3. Given the hourly data, we expect daily seasonality (24 hours) and possibly weekly seasonality (168 hours). However, with only one week of data, weekly seasonality might be hard to capture.\n\n Approach:\n - We can use a simple seasonal naive method: forecast each hour of the next day by the same hour of the previous day (or same day of the previous week). But note: we have only one week of data? Actually, we have 7 days (168 hours). \n - Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour over the past 7 days? But note: the pattern might change from weekday to weekend. However, the last day (2013-10-21) is a Monday, and the next day (2013-10-22) is a Tuesday. We can look at the previous Tuesday (2013-10-15) and also consider the recent trend.\n\n However, note that the problem says we are an expert and we have to handle missing values (but there are none in the given data). We are to forecast the next 24 hours.\n\n Considering the data, we see:\n   - The prices have a daily pattern: low at night, rising in the morning, peak during the day, and then falling in the evening.\n   - The weekdays (Mon-Fri) might have higher prices than the weekend (Sat-Sun).\n\n Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday (2013-10-22), we can use the previous Tuesday (2013-10-15) as a base, but also adjust for the recent trend.\n\n However, note that the data from 2013-10-21 (Monday) was significantly higher than the previous Monday? Actually, we don't have the previous Monday. The data starts on Tuesday (2013-10-15). So we have:\n   - Tuesday (2013-10-15)\n   - Wednesday (2013-10-16)\n   - Thursday (2013-10-17)\n   - Friday (2013-10-18)\n   - Saturday (2013-10-19)\n   - Sunday (2013-10-20)\n   - Monday (2013-10-21)\n\n We can compute the average of each hour for the same day of the week? But we only have one instance per day of the week.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a moving average or exponential smoothing. However, the problem does not specifying the method, so we choose a reasonable one.\n\n Given the constraints, a simple method is to use the average of the same hour over the last 7 days. But note: the day of the week effect. Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we might give more weight to the previous Tuesday and the Monday (as the most recent day) and less to the weekend.\n\n However, without more data, we can do:\n\n Option 1: Use the same hour from the previous day (Monday, 2013-10-21) as the forecast for Tuesday? But that might not capture the weekly pattern.\n\n Option 2: Use the same hour from the same day of last week (Tuesday, 2013-10-15) and adjust by the trend of the last week? But how?\n\n Option 3: Use the average of the same hour over the last 3 days? Or the last 7 days? Let's try:\n\n We note that the prices on Monday (2013-10-21) were significantly higher than the previous days. This might be because it's a weekday and also because of an increasing trend? \n\n Since we are forecasting for a Tuesday, and we have one Tuesday in the data (2013-10-15), we can use that as a base and then adjust by the relative change from that Tuesday to the next days? \n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average:\n\n   weight for the same day last week (Tuesday): 0.5\n   weight for the previous day (Monday): 0.5\n\n But note: the previous day (Monday) was 2013-10-21, which had a spike. Is that spike going to continue? We don't know.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays? But we have only one Tuesday.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are only allowed to use the given data, I propose:\n\n   Forecast for hour h on 2013-10-22 = (Price of hour h on 2013-10-15 [last Tuesday] + Price of hour h on 2013-10-21 [last Monday]) / 2\n\n Why? Because 2013-10-15 is the same day of the week and 2013-10-21 is the most recent day (and also a weekday). We are averaging the two weekdays.\n\n However, note that the 2013-10-21 was a Monday and it was a high price day. The Tuesday we are forecasting might be similar to Monday? But typically, Tuesdays might be similar to Mondays? \n\n Alternatively, we can use the entire week's same hour average? But the weekend days are lower and might pull down the forecast.\n\n Considering the above, I will use:\n\n   Forecast = (Last Tuesday + Last Monday) / 2\n\n But let's check the two days:\n\n   Last Tuesday (2013-10-15) and Last Monday (2013-10-21) are both weekdays.\n\n However, the prices on 2013-10-21 were much higher than 2013-10-15. So we are taking an average of two different levels.\n\n Alternatively, we can adjust the last Tuesday by the trend. We can compute the average price of the entire last Tuesday (2013-10-15) and the entire last Monday (2013-10-21) and then compute a factor:\n\n   factor = (average of Monday) / (average of Tuesday)\n\n Then, forecast for hour h = (last Tuesday at hour h) * factor\n\n But note: the daily pattern might change. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   forecast_h = (last Tuesday at hour h) * (Monday at hour h / last Tuesday at hour h)   -> but that would be Monday at hour h? \n\n Actually, that would just be Monday at hour h. So that is equivalent to using the previous day.\n\n So, let's stick to the average of the same hour from the same day last week and the previous day.\n\n Therefore, for each hour h (0 to 23) on 2013-10-22:\n\n   forecast_h = (price_h on 2013-10-15 + price_h on 2013-10-21) / 2\n\n But note: the data for 2013-10-15 and 2013-10-21 are:\n\n   2013-10-15 (Tuesday):\n        0:00 37.91\n        1:00 37.60\n        2:00 37.44\n        3:00 37.24\n        4:00 37.43\n        5:00 38.42\n        6:00 41.17\n        7:00 44.31\n        8:00 46.24\n        9:00 45.70\n        10:00 45.73\n        11:00 44.92\n        12:00 43.21\n        13:00 43.26\n        14:00 42.57\n        15:00 42.67\n        16:00 42.75\n        17:00 43.75\n        18:00 45.13\n        19:00 47.20\n        20:00 44.50\n        21:00 42.09\n        22:00 40.14\n        23:00 38.48\n\n   2013-10-21 (Monday):\n        0:00 37.74\n        1:00 37.12\n        2:00 36.94\n        3:00 36.97\n        4:00 37.45\n        5:00 38.75\n        6:00 41.10\n        7:00 49.37\n        8:00 50.83\n        9:00 50.79\n        10:00 49.99\n        11:00 48.31\n        12:00 45.96\n        13:00 45.16\n        14:00 45.07\n        15:00 45.42\n        16:00 45.06\n        17:00 47.25\n        18:00 50.30\n        19:00 52.53\n        20:00 46.53\n        21:00 42.61\n        22:00 39.36\n        23:00 38.05\n\n Now, we compute the average for each hour:\n\n   hour0: (37.91 + 37.74) / 2 = 37.825\n   hour1: (37.60 + 37.12) / 2 = 37.36\n   ... and so on.\n\n However, note that the Monday had a spike in the morning (e.g., 7:00 was 49.37 vs 44.31 on Tuesday). This method will smooth the two.\n\n But is this the best? We are an expert and we know that electricity prices are volatile and can be influenced by many factors. However, without any additional data (like load or wind) we have to rely on the historical pattern.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a more sophisticated method if we had a library, but we are to provide a forecast without using external tools.\n\n Considering the above, I will use the average of the same hour from the same day last week (the previous Tuesday) and the previous day (Monday).\n\n Let's compute the 24 forecasted values:\n\n 2013-10-22 00:00: (37.91 + 37.74) / 2 = 37.825\n 2013-10-22 01:00: (37.60 + 37.12) / 2 = 37.36\n 2013-10-22 02:00: (37.44 + 36.94) / 2 = 37.19\n 2013-10-22 03:00: (37.24 + 36.97) / 2 = 37.105\n 2013-10-22 04:00: (37.43 + 37.45) / 2 = 37.44\n 2013-10-22 05:00: (38.42 + 38.75) / 2 = 38.585\n 2013-10-22 06:00: (41.17 + 41.10) / 2 = 41.135\n 2013-10-22 07:00: (44.31 + 49.37) / 2 = 46.84\n 2013-10-22 08:00: (46.24 + 50.83) / 2 = 48.535\n 2013-10-22 09:00: (45.70 + 50.79) / 2 = 48.245\n 2013-10-22 10:00: (45.73 + 49.99) / 2 = 47.86\n 2013-10-22 11:00: (44.92 + 48.31) / 2 = 46.615\n 2013-10-22 12:00: (43.21 + 45.96) / 2 = 44.585\n 2013-10-22 13:00: (43.26 + 45.16) / 2 = 44.21\n 2013-10-22 14:00: (42.57 + 45.07) / 2 = 43.82\n 2013-10-22 15:00: (42.67 + 45.42) / 2 = 44.045\n 2013-10-22 16:00: (42.75 + 45.06) / 2 = 43.905\n 2013-10-22 17:00: (43.75 + 47.25) / 2 = 45.50\n 2013-10-22 18:00: (45.13 + 50.30) / 2 = 47.715\n 2013-10-22 19:00: (47.20 + 52.53) / 2 = 49.865\n 2013-10-22 20:00: (44.50 + 46.53) / 2 = 45.515\n 2013-10-22 21:00: (42.09 + 42.61) / 2 = 42.35\n 2013-10-22 22:00: (40.14 + 39.36) / 2 = 39.75\n 2013-10-22 23:00: (38.48 + 38.05) / 2 = 38.265\n\n But note: the problem says the dataset also contains grid load forecasts and wind power forecasts, but we are not given that data for the future and not even for the history? The problem says: \"the dataset comes from ... and contains ...\", but we are only given the OT (observed price). So we cannot use them.\n\n Therefore, we output the above 24 values.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"handle missing values carefully\". In the given data, there are no missing values. So we are safe.\n\n Let's write the forecast in the required format.\n\n The next 24 hours are from 2013-10-22 00:00 to 2013-10-22 23:00.\n\n Format:\n\n    <answer>\n        2013/10/22 0:00 37.83\n        2013/10/22 1:00 37.36\n        ... \n    </answer>\n\n We round to two decimal places? The input data had two decimals. We'll keep two decimals.\n\n But note: the computed values might have more, so we round to two decimals.\n\n Let me recalculate and round:\n\n 00:00: 37.825 -> 37.83\n 01:00: 37.36 -> 37.36\n 02:00: 37.19 -> 37.19\n 03:00: 37.105 -> 37.11\n 04:00: 37.44 -> 37.44\n 05:00: 38.585 -> 38.59\n 06:00: 41.135 -> 41.14\n 07:00: 46.84 -> 46.84\n 08:00: 48.535 -> 48.54\n 09:00: 48.245 -> 48.25\n 10:00: 47.86 -> 47.86\n 11:00: 46.615 -> 46.62\n 12:00: 44.585 -> 44.59\n 13:00: 44.21 -> 44.21\n 14:00: 43.82 -> 43.82\n 15:00: 44.045 -> 44.05\n 16:00: 43.905 -> 43.91\n 17:00: 45.50 -> 45.50\n 45.50 is already two decimals? Actually, 45.5 is 45.50? But we write 45.50? \n However, the input data did not have trailing zeros. For example, 37.91, 37.60. So we write two decimals even if the second is zero? Actually, 37.60 was written as 37.60. So we should write two decimals.\n\n 17:00: 45.50 -> 45.50\n 18:00: 47.715 -> 47.72\n 19:00: 49.865 -> 49.87\n 20:00: 45.515 -> 45.52\n 21:00: 42.35 -> 42.35 (but note: 42.35 is 42.35, which is two decimals)\n 22:00: 39.75 -> 39.75\n 23:00: 38.265 -> 38.27\n\n But wait, 38.265 rounded to two decimals: 38.27.\n\n However, let me check: \n   38.825 -> 37.83? Actually, 37.825: \n        The third decimal is 5, so we round up: 37.83.\n\n But note: 37.825 is for the first hour? Actually, we did 37.91+37.74=75.65, divided by 2 is 37.825 -> rounded to 37.83.\n\n So the forecast:\n\n 2013/10/22 0:00 37.83\n 2013/10/22 1:00 37.36\n 2013/10/22 2:00 37.19\n 2013/10/22 3:00 37.11\n 2013/10/22 4:00 37.44\n 2013/10/22 5:00 38.59\n 2013/10/22 6:00 41.14\n 2013/10/22 7:00 46.84\n 2013/10/22 8:00 48.54\n 2013/10/22 9:00 48.25\n 2013/10/22 10:00 47.86\n 2013/10/22 11:00 46.62\n 2013/10/22 12:00 44.59\n 2013/10/22 13:00 44.21\n 2013/10/22 14:00 43.82\n 2013/10/22 15:00 44.05\n 2013/10/22 16:00 43.91\n 2013/10/22 17:00 45.50\n 2013/10/22 18:00 47.72\n 2013/10/22 19:00 49.87\n 2013/10/22 20:00 45.52\n 2013/10/22 21:00 42.35\n 2013/10/22 22:00 39.75\n 2013/10/22 23:00 38.27\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Observed Nord Pool electricity price\" and we are forecasting. We are to output the forecast for the next 24 hours.\n\n We output in the same format as the input, but for the next day.\n\n Let me write the answer in the required XML-like format.\n",
