        "reasoning": "We are given 168 hours of historical electricity price data (from 2014/6/3 0:00 to 2014/6/9 23:00). We need to forecast the next 24 hours (i.e., from 2014/6/10 0:00 to 2014/6/10 23:00).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Check for missing values: The provided data seems complete (168 data points for 7 days * 24 hours). So no missing values in the given data.\n 2. We are only given the 'OT' (observed price) and not the grid load or wind power forecasts. Therefore, we must rely on time series forecasting methods that use only the historical prices.\n\n Approach:\n Since we are to forecast the next 24 hours, we have a clear daily seasonality (24 hours). We can use a model that captures seasonality and trends.\n\n However, note that the data shows:\n   - Daily pattern: low during night, increasing in the morning, peak during the day, and decreasing in the evening.\n   - Also, there might be a weekly pattern (weekdays vs weekends). The data covers from Tuesday (2014/6/3) to Monday (2014/6/9). The last day (2014/6/9) is a Monday.\n\n We are to forecast for Tuesday (2014/6/10) which is the next day after Monday.\n\n Given the complexity and the need for a quick forecast without external variables, we can use:\n   - Seasonal Naive: using the same hour from the previous day (or same day of the week) as forecast.\n   - But note: the pattern on Monday (2014/6/9) might be different from Tuesday (2014/6/10) because of weekly seasonality.\n\n Alternatively, we can use an average of the same hour from the previous weekdays? However, the data only has one week.\n\n Since we are limited to the given data, we can consider:\n   - Using the same hour from the previous day (Monday) for Tuesday? But the previous day (Monday) is 2014/6/9, and we are forecasting Tuesday 2014/6/10.\n\n However, let's look at the data: \n   - The week starts on Tuesday (2014/6/3) and we have 7 days. We can take the average of each hour over the same day of the week? But we only have one Tuesday (2014/6/3) and one of each day.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the last few days for the same hour? \n\n Considering the short history, we can use a moving window. But note that the weekend (6/7 and 6/8) are Saturdays and Sundays, which might have different patterns.\n\n Since we are forecasting a Tuesday, we can use the previous Tuesday (2014/6/3) and the Monday (2014/6/9) as the most recent day? But Monday is not Tuesday.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple method: take the average of the same hour over the last 7 days? But that would include weekend days which are different.\n\n We can try to use the last Tuesday (2014/6/3) and adjust it with the most recent trend? \n\n However, without more data, a robust method is to use a seasonal naive model that uses the same day of the week from the previous week. Since we have only one week, we can use the data from the same day of the week (i.e., the previous Tuesday) for the forecast. But note: the previous Tuesday is 7 days ago.\n\n But we also have the data from the last 24 hours (Monday) which might be more relevant? \n\n Considering the trade-off, we can use a weighted average of the same hour from:\n   - The previous day (Monday, 2014/6/9)\n   - The same day of the previous week (Tuesday, 2014/6/3)\n\n However, without a clear way to set weights, and given the simplicity required, we can use the average of the same hour over the last two weekdays? But the last two weekdays are Monday (2014/6/9) and Friday (2014/6/6) and then Thursday (2014/6/5), etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple exponential smoothing state space model with seasonality (Holt-Winters). But we are not allowed to use external libraries and must do it manually.\n\n Given the constraints, I will use a simple method: \n   - For each hour of the day (0 to 23), we take the average of that hour over the last 3 weekdays (excluding the weekend?).\n\n But note: the last 3 weekdays are:\n   - Monday (2014/6/9) -> Friday (2014/6/6) -> Thursday (2014/6/5) -> Wednesday (2014/6/4) -> Tuesday (2014/6/3)\n\n Actually, we have 5 weekdays: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday (since Saturday and Sunday are weekends). We can use the last 3 weekdays: Monday, Friday, Thursday? But Monday is the most recent.\n\n However, the problem: we are forecasting a Tuesday. The most similar day would be the previous Tuesday? But that is 7 days ago and might be outdated.\n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for all the weekdays in the available week? That would be 5 days: Tuesday (2014/6/3), Wednesday (2014/6/4), Thursday (2014/6/5), Friday (2014/6/6), and Monday (2014/6/9). But note: Monday is the day before the forecast day (Tuesday) and might be more similar than the previous Tuesday? \n\n However, we can compute the average for each hour over these 5 weekdays and use that as the forecast.\n\n But let's check the data: \n   - The prices on Monday (2014/6/9) are generally lower than the previous Tuesday (2014/6/3) for example at 8:00: 34.09 (Tue) vs 25.77 (Mon). \n\n Why not use the previous day (Monday) as the base and adjust by the difference between the previous Tuesday and the current Tuesday? \n\n We don't have the current Tuesday, so we cannot do that.\n\n Considering the above, I will use the average of the same hour over the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) because they are the most recent weekdays. Why not include Wednesday? We can include all 5 weekdays? \n\n However, including too many days might smooth out recent changes. \n\n Alternatively, we can use a weighted average: more weight to the most recent days.\n\n I propose: \n   - Use the average of the same hour for the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) with weights: 0.5 for Monday, 0.3 for Friday, 0.2 for Thursday.\n\n But without a strong reason for the weights, we can use equal weights.\n\n Let me calculate the forecast for hour 0:00 (the first hour of the forecast day) as an example:\n\n   Hour 0:00:\n     Monday (2014/6/9): 18.80\n     Friday (2014/6/6): 19.18\n     Thursday (2014/6/5): 18.27\n\n     Average = (18.80 + 19.18 + 18.27) / 3 = 56.25 / 3 = 18.75\n\n But we can also the previous Tuesday (2014/6/3): 21.77. That is quite different. So we avoid including it because it's a week old.\n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the last 3 weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) for each hour.\n\n However, note that the last 3 weekdays are not consecutive because we skip the weekend. But that's okay.\n\n Steps for each hour (0 to 23):\n   - Take the value for that hour from Monday (2014/6/9), Friday (2014/6/6), and Thursday (2014/6/5).\n   - Compute the average.\n\n But wait, what about the day of the week effect? We are forecasting a Tuesday, and we are using Monday, Friday, Thursday. It might be better to use the same day of the week (i.e., the previous Tuesday) and the most recent days? \n\n However, we have only one Tuesday in the data. We can try to use the previous Tuesday and the average of the last three weekdays? \n\n But to keep it simple and because the previous Tuesday is a week old, I will stick with the average of the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday). \n\n Let me check the pattern for a specific hour (e.g., 8:00) over the weekdays:\n\n   Tuesday (2014/6/3): 34.09\n   Wednesday (2014/6/4): 33.69\n   Thursday (2014/6/5): 32.78\n   Friday (2014/6/6): 30.92\n   Monday (2014/6/9): 25.77\n\n There is a downward trend. So the most recent Monday is the lowest. For forecasting Tuesday, we might expect a value that is not as low as the previous Tuesday? \n\n But without more data, it's hard to say. \n\n Alternatively, we can use the average of the same day of the week (i.e., the previous Tuesday) and the day before (Monday) with weights. For example, 0.7 for Monday and 0.3 for the previous Tuesday? \n\n However, the previous Tuesday is 7 days ago and the market conditions might have changed.\n\n Considering the above, I will use the average of the last three weekdays (Monday, Friday, Thursday) for each hour.\n\n But note: the last three weekdays are not the same as the day we are forecasting (Tuesday). \n\n Another idea: use the average of the same hour for the last three days (including the weekend) but that might introduce weekend patterns. \n\n Since we are forecasting a weekday (Tuesday), it is better to use only weekdays.\n\n Therefore, I will use the average of the same hour for the last three weekdays: Monday (2014/6/9), Friday (2014/6/6), and Thursday (2014/6/5).\n\n Let's compute the forecast for each hour from 0:00 to 23:00 for 2014/6/10.\n\n We'll create a list for the next 24 hours (0:00 to 23:00) and for each hour, we take the values from:\n   - Monday at that hour\n   - Friday at that hour\n   - Thursday at that hour\n\n Then average.\n\n Example for hour 0:00:\n   Thursday (2014/6/5 0:00): 18.27\n   Friday (2014/6/6 0:00): 19.18\n   Monday (2014/6/9 0:00): 18.80\n   Average = (18.27 + 19.18 + 18.80) / 3 = 56.25 / 3 = 18.75\n\n Similarly for other hours.\n\n However, note: the data for Thursday, Friday, and Monday are:\n\n   Hour 0:00: Thu=18.27, Fri=19.18, Mon=18.80 -> 18.75\n   Hour 1:00: Thu=17.69, Fri=18.18, Mon=17.47 -> (17.69+18.18+17.47)/3 = 53.34/3 = 17.78\n\n and so on.\n\n But let's check the hour 8:00:\n   Thu: 32.78, Fri: 30.92, Mon: 25.77 -> (32.78+30.92+25.77)/3 = 89.47/3 = 29.82\n\n This is lower than the previous Tuesday (34.09) but consistent with the downward trend we observed.\n\n We'll compute for all 24 hours.\n\n However, note: the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) are not included. This is intentional because we are forecasting a weekday.\n\n Let's compute the forecast for the next 24 hours (2014/6/10 0:00 to 23:00) using the average of the same hour from Thursday, Friday, and Monday.\n\n We'll list the historical data for Thursday (2014/6/5), Friday (2014/6/6), and Monday (2014/6/9) for each hour:\n\n Hour 0: Thu=18.27, Fri=19.18, Mon=18.80 -> 18.75\n Hour 1: Thu=17.69, Fri=18.18, Mon=17.47 -> 17.78\n Hour 2: Thu=17.37, Fri=17.81, Mon=16.98 -> 17.39\n Hour 3: Thu=16.92, Fri=17.38, Mon=16.49 -> 16.93\n Hour 4: Thu=17.00, Fri=17.57, Mon=16.38 -> 16.98\n Hour 5: Thu=17.39, Fri=18.96, Mon=17.23 -> 17.86\n Hour 6: Thu=23.94, Fri=25.05, Mon=21.01 -> 23.33\n Hour 7: Thu=30.99, Fri=29.89, Mon=24.06 -> 28.31\n Hour 8: Thu=32.78, Fri=30.92, Mon=25.77 -> 29.82\n Hour 9: Thu=32.73, Fri=30.60, Mon=26.22 -> 29.85\n Hour 10: Thu=32.71, Fri=30.24, Mon=28.03 -> 30.33\n Hour 11: Thu=31.96, Fri=28.88, Mon=28.06 -> 29.63\n Hour 12: Thu=31.81, Fri=27.31, Mon=27.70 -> 28.94\n Hour 13: Thu=30.41, Fri=26.42, Mon=26.62 -> 27.82\n Hour 14: Thu=29.08, Fri=25.73, Mon=25.58 -> 26.80\n Hour 15: Thu=28.25, Fri=24.37, Mon=25.40 -> 26.01\n Hour 16: Thu=27.70, Fri=23.86, Mon=24.48 -> 25.35\n Hour 17: Thu=26.73, Fri=24.53, Mon=24.17 -> 25.14\n Hour 18: Thu=29.03, Fri=26.65, Mon=24.67 -> 26.78\n Hour 19: Thu=30.30, Fri=28.17, Mon=26.05 -> 28.17\n Hour 20: Thu=28.77, Fri=26.84, Mon=26.25 -> 27.29\n Hour 21: Thu=27.28, Fri=26.27, Mon=25.38 -> 26.31\n Hour 22: Thu=26.27, Fri=24.88, Mon=25.90 -> 25.68\n Hour 23: Thu=21.16, Fri=20.75, Mon=19.67 -> 20.53\n\n Therefore, the forecast for 2014/6/10:\n\n 0:00: 18.75\n 1:00: 17.78\n 2:00: 17.39\n 3:00: 16.93\n 4:00: 16.98\n 5:00: 17.86\n 6:00: 23.33\n 7:00: 28.31\n 8:00: 29.82\n 9:00: 29.85\n10:00: 30.33\n11:00: 29.63\n12:00: 28.94\n13:00: 27.82\n14:00: 26.80\n15:00: 26.01\n16:00: 25.35\n17:00: 25.14\n18:00: 26.78\n19:00: 28.17\n20:00: 27.29\n21:00: 26.31\n22:00: 25.68\n23:00: 20.53\n\n We output the forecast in the same format as the historical data, but for the next day: 2014/6/10 0:00 to 2014/6/10 23:00.\n\n Note: The date format in the input is inconsistent: sometimes there is a space after the date and sometimes not? But the input has:\n   \"2014/6/3 0:00\" and \"2014/6/3 1:00\", etc.\n\n We'll output with the same format: \"2014/6/10 0:00\", \"2014/6/10 1:00\", ... \"2014/6/10 23:00\"\n\n Let's write the forecast in the required format.\n",
